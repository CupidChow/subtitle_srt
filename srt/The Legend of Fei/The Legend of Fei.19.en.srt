Where are your manners?

19
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,720
You’ve made a name for yourself

20
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,480
as Miss South Blade

21
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,590
by killing Qiu Tianjin
and Dragon Master.

22
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,440
I, Yang Jin,

23
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,340
challenge you to a duel.

24
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,190
Qiu Tianjin and Dragon Master?

25
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,910
What do they have to do with me?

26
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,630
What?

27
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,270
You don’t know who you’ve killed?

28
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,800
I killed them?

29
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,440
It’s known to all

30
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,000
that Miss South Blade

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,680
eliminated Dragon Master
of the Four-guardian Mountain

32
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,760
as well as Qiu Tianjin.

33
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,100
How could you not know?

34
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,870
Oh, them.

35
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,080
I know.

36
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,790
I heard what happened in the tea house.

37
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,550
The storyteller knew nothing.

38
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,880
You really believe him?

39
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,110
Are you a fool?

40
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,960
I’m serious!

41
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,440
Everyone knows how they died.

42
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,390
Don’t try to fool me.

43
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,640
I swear I have nothing to do with it.

44
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,240
Did you mistake me for someone else?

45
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,030
Is there another heiress
to the South Blade?

46
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,300
Another heiress?

47
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,540
Does he mean Fei?

48
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,910
Why are you laughing?

49
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,190
I’m laughing at you.

50
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,830
You bonehead!

51
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,750
My grandfather’s offspring are many.

52
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,550
I’m confused.

53
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,390
How would I know who he taught?

54
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,830
Neither do I care.

55
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,830
It could be anyone in our Fortress.

56
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,000
We’ve got too many people there.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,110
Feel free to check with them one by one.

58
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,320
I’m off.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,550
Are you messing with me?

60
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,830
He’s surprisingly sharp.

61
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,240
Do you think I’m not qualified

62
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,030
to challenge you?

63
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,550
You know what?

64
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,440
I demand

65
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,960
that we battle it out!

66
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,670
What’s your problem?

67
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,080
Are you deaf?

68
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,030
I said I’m not
the South Blade’s heiress.

69
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,440
Why don’t you believe me?

70
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,000
Do I look like I can wield blades?

71
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,520
Hey,

72
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,270
you already knocked me out once.

73
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,270
What are you trying to do now?

74
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,550
Let me go,

75
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,360
or I’ll report you to the authority

76
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,520
for abduction.

77
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,960
Abduction?

78
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,910
We can work things out

79
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,720
ourselves.

80
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,000
What do you need the authority for?

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,800
What things do you mean?

82
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,520
Never mind. Anyway,

83
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,110
let’s see if the South Blade is better

84
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,530
than the 13 Goose-breaking Blades.

85
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,270
Mr. Yang.

86
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,600
Mr. Yang.

87
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,390
You made a mistake.

88
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,610
(Chief Xu, Route Gang)
She isn’t the South Blade.

89
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,720
Look,

90
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,880
you’ve paid us a fortune

91
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,080
and we’ll definitely

92
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,670
find the person you ask for.

93
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,720
When will that be?

94
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,450
We’ve already tracked her down.

95
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,240
She goes by the name

96
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,270
of Zhou Fei.

97
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,080
Fei? You’ve found her?

98
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,520
Fei?

99
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,550
Not anyone

100
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,360
get to call her that.

101
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,390
Sir,

102
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,950
Miss Zhou Fei has shown up.

103
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,640
Where is she? Take me to see her.

104
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,160
I miss her so much!

105
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,760
Let me spare you the trip.

106
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,920
I can bring her here,

107
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,320
but I need

108
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,660
something from you.

109
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,600
That girl

110
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,670
is South Blade,
Li Zheng’s granddaughter.

111
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,760
We must stop her

112
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,070
from acting up again.

113
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,760
But we can’t keep her forever.

114
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,640
If we let her go,

115
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,600
all our efforts will be in vain.

116
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,320
We can give her whatever she needs

117
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,350
but she can’t step out.

118
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,230
What do you think?

119
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,480
What choice do we have?

120
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,920
How come you can
make yourself at home everywhere?

121
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,950
Why do I sense disapproval?

122
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,300
That shows I’m capable, alright?

123
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,550
You’re just thick-skinned.

124
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,070
Having a thick skin is useful.

125
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,040
I gained that

126
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,950
by begging others for food.

127
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,290
You what?

128
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,000
I was a beggar.

129
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,110
When I was little,

130
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,600
my master thought I was too spoiled

131
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,180
to practice martial arts,

132
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,230
so he kicked me out,

133
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,520
leaving me penniless in the street.

134
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,560
He said

135
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,880
if I could survive the next three years,

136
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,390
he’d teach me skills to protect myself.

137
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,870
Your master is right. You’re spoiled.

138
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,790
Don’t interrupt me.

139
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,160
I’m reminiscing

140
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,350
about the past.

141
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,400
Go on. Continue.

142
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,920
Back then,

143
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,340
I was a nobody

144
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,320
in the Beggars’ Gang.

145
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,350
Although their members

146
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,040
claimed to be righteous,

147
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,350
many of them

148
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,630
were bullies.

149
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,230
The high-level beggars
bullied the low-level ones.

150
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,890
It was common.

151
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,150
I couldn’t stand it,

152
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,830
so I left and sang in the streets

153
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,130
in exchange for food.

154
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,540
That was easy

155
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,040
for a good-looking man like me.

156
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,340
You must be proud.

157
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,500
Did your master and his clan get killed?

158
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,710
You asked me the question.

159
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,380
I answered it but you don’t believe me.

160
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,720
Oh, women!

161
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,640
Women?

162
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,780
What’s wrong with them?

163
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,720
You’re awake, Madam.

164
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,670
I assume you’ve recovered.

165
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,570
That’s good.

166
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,720
Thank you for saving my life.

167
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,980
Put your hands down.

168
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,310
Qian Suiyou,

169
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,000
do you have

170
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,390
a better thank-you gift for me?

171
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,350
You’re wise, Madam.

172
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,200
I’ve prepared

173
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,200
a little something for you.

174
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,720
Very well.

175
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,040
Come with me.

176
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,760
Let me see

177
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,610
what you’ve got for me.

178
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,690
I didn’t realize

179
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,830
until now

180
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,510
that she seems to be different

181
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,780
from the person I knew.

182
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,500
I feel as if she’s walking on clouds.

183
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,760
How charming!

184
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,180
Look at me.

185
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,350
I’m a man of great charm, too.

186
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,640
I’m done.

187
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,900
(Qiaoyun House)

188
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,540
(The Caw)

189
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,250
Why are you staring at her like that?

190
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,640
Fei?

191
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,520
I’m glad to see

192
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,000
she’s healthy again.

193
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,500
That’s only what she seems to be.

194
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,960
Her steps

195
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,200
looked firm,

196
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,150
but they were

197
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,370
slightly weak and unsteady.

198
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,470
Although

199
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,670
she turns to be all radiant so quickly,

200
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,580
she’s lost

201
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,840
most of her energy

202
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,260
and can’t be hurt again.

203
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,580
Madam,

204
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:11,900
are you alright?

205
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,300
Are you sure you want me to have it?

206
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,810
Why do I feel

207
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,880
you’re paying me back

208
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,380
with someone else’s treasure?

209
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,650
That’s nothing

210
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,640
compared with the risk you took

211
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,030
to save us.

212
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,640
And the so-called treasure

213
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,550
shouldn’t fall

214
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,640
into the wrong hands.

215
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,640
You deserve it

216
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,470
better than anyone else.

217
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,080
Aren’t you sweet?

218
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,230
Alright, I’ll take it.

219
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,470
You are such

220
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,810
a delicate girl.

221
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,840
And

222
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,230
a skinny one, too.

223
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,790
I thought Mr. Li

224
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,710
would pick

225
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,140
a healthy boy to be his heir.

226
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,100
Were it decided by the given physique,

227
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,000
most people

228
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,520
could never practice martial arts.

229
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,590
I’m not an heiress

230
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,640
and I still need to practice hard.

231
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,790
My skills are far from perfect

232
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,710
as I still have a lot to learn.

233
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,440
The...

234
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,710
The way you speak

235
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,290
is the same as his.

236
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,230
You’ve

237
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,350
reminded me

238
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,420
of the first time I met him.

239
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,550
Back then, many of us

240
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,000
traveled together.

241
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,470
I asked him

242
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,790
who his master was.

243
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,150
He didn’t say

244
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,960
and just told me

245
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,790
he didn’t have one.

246
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,470
What he practiced was
skills created by his ancestors

247
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,260
and he was unversed.

248
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,110
Hearing that,

249
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,150
I assumed he was some bumpkin

250
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,030
who came out to explore

251
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,550
before mastering his skills.

252
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,230
You know what happened later?

253
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,320
We were stunned

254
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,280
the first time he struck.

255
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,030
Doesn’t modesty run in your family?

256
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,590
My grandfather

257
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,110
was gentle and modest.

258
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,670
He said that to be humble,

259
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,080
but I’m not.

260
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,640
I’m only a beginner.

261
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,460
It’s true.

262
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,910
The two streams of energy you have

263
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,880
are incompatible

264
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,450
but they coexist with each other in you.

265
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,350
That rarely happens.

266
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,400
Master.

267
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,200
What’s up?

268
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,400
Our place is surrounded by many people.

269
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,840
The front and back doors are blocked.

270
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,030
What should we do?

271
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,150
Are you the target

272
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,640
or I am?

273
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,780
How would I know?

274
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,360
Could it be...

275
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,230
Shen Tianshu?

276
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,280
No way.

277
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,910
He isn’t that stupid.

278
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,110
At this stage,

279
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,350
coming at the Yuyi Troupe

280
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,480
is of no use.

281
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,800
Am I the stupid one then?

282
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,550
How dare they!

283
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,880
Miss Lingyu,

284
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,110
what do they look like?

285
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,550
Nothing special.

286
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,320
Just like men in the streets.

287
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,000
Whoever they are,

288
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,520
we can beat them back.

289
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,780
(Qiaoyun House)

290
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,230
Look at you!

291
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,470
The Route Gang is as bold as they say.

292
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,760
You are able to find me.

293
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,200
It’s the Route Gang.

294
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,840
Why are they here?

295
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,900
Is Mr. Bai looking for you?

296
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,910
I don’t think so.

297
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,850
Why would he go to such great lengths?

298
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,510
Madam Nichang,

299
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,350
sorry for disturbing you.

300
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,080
Oh, save it!

301
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,320
I don’t get it.

302
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,030
I’m simply making a living

303
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,030
by entertaining guests.

304
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,440
Have I offended you somehow

305
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,150
that you flock outside my place?

306
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,320
My girls

307
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,550
are delicate

308
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,200
and timid.

309
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,470
This scene you’re making

310
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,150
can easily scare them.

311
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,930
Can you take responsibility?

312
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,600
I apologize for my abrupt visit.

313
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,510
I’m here to look for a girl

314
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,590
who killed Qiu Tianjin

315
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,750
and Dragon Master in a row.

316
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,550
Did they both die

317
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,830
in your hands?

318
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,440
No. I didn’t...

319
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,550
Well done!

320
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,520
Don’t worry. I got this.

321
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,320
She’s my guest.

322
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,840
Who are you

323
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,880
to ask for my girl?

324
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,110
I’m not

325
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,440
afraid of you.

326
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,350
Go back

327
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,840
to where you belong!

328
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,550
Calm down.

329
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,750
Do you recognize this?

330
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,460
That’s Li Yan’s bracelet.

331
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,310
Why did she leave the Fortress?

332
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,840
Who employed you?

333
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,720
How did you get that bracelet?

334
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,020
Do you want to die?

335
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,600
I’m not told

336
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,240
to keep the employer’s name secret.

337
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,080
Are you aware of

338
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,320
the Cloud Ravine?

339
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,330
What’s that? Never heard of it.

340
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,920
That bracelet belongs to my cousin.

341
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,080
Does your ignorant employer know

342
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,600
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight?

343
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,520
How did my cousin offend you?

344
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,800
Whatever you need,

345
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,260
you can go to the Fortress

346
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,870
and ask Leader Li for it.

347
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,040
So

348
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,120
is the Cloud Ravine some unknown hovel?

349
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,320
Are you South Blade?

350
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,710
Did you call the Cloud Ravine

351
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,150
an unknown hovel?

352
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,840
Are you the employer?

353
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,200
The head of the Cloud Ravine, Yang Jin.

354
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,640
The South Blade is said
to be the number one blade.

355
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,080
The blade I’m holding

356
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,150
is called Goose-breaking.

357
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,470
After 20 years of practice,

358
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,790
I’m here to challenge you.

359
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,350
If you agree,

360
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,790
the hostage will be safe

361
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,600
regardless of the result.

362
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,430
You’ve seen my weapon.

363
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,770
Where’s yours?

364
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,540
I don’t have one.

365
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,830
She doesn’t have it!

366
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,670
20 years ago,

367
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,790
Ji Yunchen held Yin Pei hostage

368
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,280
to challenge his father.

369
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,150
Now, history is repeating itself.

370
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,960
You’re in the same situation.

371
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,320
Yin Pei’s father was a legend

372
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,640
but I’m a phony.

373
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,740
Stop lying!

374
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,670
Show me your blade!

375
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,710
Enough!

376
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,320
Yuyi Troupe won’t take such an insult!

377
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,000
Neither will

378
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,550
the Cloud Ravine!

379
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,330
Jin.

380
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,230
He’s young and hot-tempered.

381
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,100
Don’t mind him.

382
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,110
We dare not insult you.

383
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,440
I’m sure

384
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,280
the successor to the South Blade

385
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,710
must be something.

386
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,350
Not everyone can keep
his or her promise,

387
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,280
but I believe

388
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,030
you’re a girl of her word.

389
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,200
I suggest

390
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,050
we take a rain check.

391
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,750
How about we meet here again

392
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,930
in three days?

393
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,320
You’re

394
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,000
playing with words

395
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,880
as if

396
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,790
she’s agreed to take up the challenge.

397
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,960
The highly skilled
head of the Cloud Ravine

398
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:16,040
colluded with

399
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,560
the well-connected Route Gang

400
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,160
and kidnapped an innocent girl

401
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,350
only to pick a fight

402
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,500
for an empty title.

403
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,590
Well,

404
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:27,430
shame on you!

405
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,640
I’ve kept that in mind.

406
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,590
I...

407
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,070
That’s right.

408
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,350
Were it just me and the Yuyi Troupe,

409
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,060
we’d only entertain the guests with it.

410
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,120
But now that she’s involved,

411
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,800
I bet

412
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,820
the whole world will know tomorrow.

413
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,420
Madam,

414
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,430
are your girls bold enough to sing

415
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,590
at the cost of being silenced

416
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,670
by the widely respected Route Gang?

417
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,880
Men who understood my songs

418
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,830
all died 20 years ago.

419
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,710
The rest

420
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,380
aren’t worth mentioning.

421
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,710
I’ve lived long enough anyway.

422
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,230
You can take my head

423
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,970
to Shen Tianshu

424
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,230
in case he needs a ball

425
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,190
to kick.

426
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,590
May I ask your name?

427
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,710
I’m

428
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,760
surnamed Xu.

429
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,370
Alright.

430
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,110
Since you’ve given us three days,

431
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,680
then make sure we see Miss Li here

432
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,560
by then

433
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,930
safe and sound.

434
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,640
Otherwise...

435
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,830
You’re a wise man, Chief Xu.

436
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,350
You should know what to do.

437
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,240
What now?

438
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,050
Are you scared?

439
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,590
After what you’ve done,

440
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,320
you still call yourself chivalrous?

441
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,470
You don’t

442
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,560
deserve my time.

443
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,000
You...

444
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,280
Well said!

445
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,390
Goodbye.

446
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,710
Come back!

447
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:00,950
Listen,

448
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,070
if you change your mind,

449
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,590
come to the Route Gang on Shili Street.

450
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,520
Let’s go.

451
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,510
I know you’re being modest.

452
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,880
No, I’m not.

453
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,280
I understand.

454
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,000
You can stay here

455
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,470
for a while

456
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,000
in case those rats harass you again.

457
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Got it?

458
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,470
You’ve earned a reputation

459
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,480
by battling others

460
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,260
and troubles would follow.

461
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,540
Like I ask for them.

462
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,190
I must say you acted well

463
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,340
in front of them.

464
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,880
I might not be a skilled martial artist,

465
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,600
but I’m a good actress.

466
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,520
Let’s go.

467
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,680
Lingyu,

468
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,400
check Yang Jin out

469
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,500
and see if he’s plotting anything.

470
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,230
Yes. Master.

471
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,070
Master!

472
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,280
Master!

473
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,860
I’m fine.

474
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,230
Recovery takes time.

475
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,070
Don’t worry.

476
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,560
Didn’t I tell you to behave yourself

477
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,560
and not to offend Madam Nichang?

478
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,040
You did.

479
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,190
That woman and her girls

480
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,310
seem weak

481
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,400
but they’re highly skilled.

482
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,830
We can’t afford to piss them off.

483
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,280
The South Blade’s successor ignored me.

484
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,430
Did she refuse to battle me?

485
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,070
No.

486
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,110
I must talk to her again.

487
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,830
Mr. Yang,

488
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,830
don’t stir up more trouble

489
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,230
than we already have.

490
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,430
Let’s go back.

491
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,560
Don’t forget

492
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,000
we still have a troublemaker

493
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
at home.

494
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,110
I don’t believe she’s a Li,

495
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,710
especially after meeting that girl.

496
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,280
Mr. Yang,

497
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,230
let me take care of the rest, alright?

498
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,040
Can we please go back now?

499
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,040
Let’s go.

500
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,110
Ow! Ow! Ow!

501
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,280
It’s me.

502
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,710
Why are you sneaking up on me?

503
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,560
Let... let go.

504
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,120
You’re the sneaky one.

505
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,720
Why did you come out without me?

506
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,950
Didn’t I take you to the tea house

507
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,000
for food and entertainment last night?

508
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,400
Li Yan is kidnapped

509
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,310
and probably suffering a lot.

510
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,230
I have to get her out

511
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,190
and spare me

512
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,830
from that ridiculous challenge.

513
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,160
I can be of help!

514
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,830
Let’s go. Don’t lose them.

515
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,160
Baked buns! Wontons!

516
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,470
Have a look.

517
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,000
Mister, please go.

518
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,830
Baked buns! Wontons!

519
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,110
Freshly baked buns!

520
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,710
-Let’s search the place
-Take a look.

521
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,640
and find where she’s kept.

522
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,680
Anyone?

523
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,630
Let me out!

524
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,520
If my family finds out

525
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,950
what you’ve done to me,

526
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,760
you’ll be doomed!

527
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,300
Anyone here?

528
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,310
Bonehead,

529
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,520
why didn’t you knock?

530
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,190
What if I got startled?

531
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,560
Can you take responsibility?

532
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,470
And

533
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,190
I don’t feel well being kept here.

534
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,160
Get me some peaches.

535
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,590
You... You...

536
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,970
Unbelievable!

537
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,190
Don’t give me that look.

538
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,710
Do you know

539
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,590
who my aunt and uncle are?

540
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,470
How dare you

541
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,040
kidnap...

542
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,470
Are you really the South Blade,
Li Zheng’s granddaughter?

543
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,950
Yes, I am.

544
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,520
Are you scared?

545
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,800
I can’t believe you’re related to him!

546
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,110
Why?

547
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,350
Or would you rather be his grandson?

548
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,470
No way!

549
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,400
He wouldn’t want you.

550
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,680
You’re too cheap

551
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,710
to be in my family!

552
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,160
I...

553
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,400
Mr. Yang, Mr. Yang,

554
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,560
don’t be mad.

555
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,000
She... She...

556
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,920
She insulted me!

557
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,830
I must teach her a lesson

558
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,310
to make a point!

559
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,470
You know she can’t fight.

560
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,070
Could you take the consequences

561
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,800
if you injured her?

562
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,000
You liar!

563
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,190
You said Fei would be here.

564
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,190
Where is she? I’ve waited forever!

565
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,630
Be patient, Miss.

566
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,640
There’s something

567
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,830
between her and Mr. Yang

568
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,430
that’s left to be settled.

569
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,190
Hey,

570
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,760
are you trying to challenge her?

571
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,920
So what if I am?

572
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,640
-I can enjoy my time here.
-I...

573
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,590
Bonehead,

574
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,230
better watch out,

575
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,920
or you’ll lose miserably!

576
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,640
You...

577
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,520
Do we

578
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,280
need to rescue her?

579
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,280
I’m afraid so.

580
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,800
Go distract those two.

581
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,310
I’ll get her out.

582
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,860
Sure.

583
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,310
I’ll go to the front door

584
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,380
to call them out.

585
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,830
Chief Xu,

586
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,310
nice meeting you again.

587
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,310
I have a message

588
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,830
for the head of the Cloud Ravine.

589
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:29,810
Can you ask him to come out?

590
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,680
Sure. Please wait a minute.

591
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,990
It’s you!

592
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,790
Where’s she?

593
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,400
Sorry, she didn’t come.

594
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,560
What do you want?

595
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,830
Let me out!

596
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:21,520
Let me out now!

597
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,560
Are you done?

598
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,560
Fei! Is it really you?

599
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,350
I miss you dearly!

600
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,190
You don’t know

601
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,830
how miserable I am.

602
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:35,950
You call this miserable?

603
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,230
Your face is round.

604
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,780
Let’s get out of here.

605
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,620
I can’t.

606
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,640
I’ve promised

607
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,280
that you’ll battle him in three days.

608
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,800
I must make good on it.

609
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,920
Since when did you
get to make decisions for me?

610
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,760
Are you going with me or not?

611
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,040
I’m not going anywhere.

612
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,560
Here I’m well-fed

613
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,160
and I can tease that bonehead.

614
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,460
Where else could I have so much fun?

615
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:01,000
Aren’t you afraid they’ll kill you?

616
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,400
No way.

617
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,230
At least not before the challenge.

618
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:04,950
Fei,

619
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:05,830
you must

620
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,560
teach that bonehead a lesson for me.

621
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,880
The dignity of our Fortress

622
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,350
depends on you.

623
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,800
Do it yourself.

624
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,920
Let’s go, or I’ll be rough!

625
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,760
You’re bullying me again.

626
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,880
I’ll tell Aunt about it.

627
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Bonehead.

628
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,560
You are...?

629
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,310
Don’t be scared.

630
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,640
I’m confused.

631
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,680
Who’s the kidnapper

632
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,400
and who’s the victim?

633
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,520
Why do I feel like

634
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,480
I’m the bad guy here?

635
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,350
I remember it.

636
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,400
You kidnapped my uncle.

637
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,110
You really are a bad guy!

638
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,950
Chill out.

639
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:49,950
Listen to me.

640
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,310
Miss,

641
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,640
he’s holding you hostage

642
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,560
to challenge Fei to a duel.

643
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,400
I know.

644
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,640
He’s not her match.

645
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,800
Neither is she willing to battle him.

646
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,560
Mr. Yang,

647
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,470
Fei won’t

648
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,920
accept the challenge.

649
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,000
Let’s not

650
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,140
waste our time.

651
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,550
Miss,

652
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,760
let’s go and see Fei,

653
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,470
alright?

654
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,680
You’re lying!

655
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,950
Fei hates you.

656
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,640
How could she be with you?

657
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,680
Why would I lie?

658
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,800
Whatever.

659
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,640
It’s safer to stay here

660
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,230
than leave with you.

661
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,660
Let’s go, Bonehead.

662
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,280
Hey...

663
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,130
Sorry,

664
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,950
it’s not that I refuse to let her go.

665
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:30,830
See you in three days.

666
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,470
She and I will both be there.

667
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,920
I promise.

668
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,700
(Miaoan Pharmacy)

669
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,420
(Miaoan Pharmacy)

670
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,500
Miss Chuchu, have a seat.

671
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,000
Excuse me, are you the owner?

672
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,450
Yes, I am.

673
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,090
What do you need, sir?

674
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,770
Fill this prescription.

675
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,080
Sure.

676
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,060
Sir,

677
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,800
I don’t have any money with me.

678
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,830
Is this

679
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,160
enough to pay for the herbs?

680
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,580
You’re one of us.

681
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,400
It’s been a while

682
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,790
since I met members of Xiaoxiang.

683
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,430
Sorry,

684
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,650
I’m not their member.

685
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,090
Why do you have their token?

686
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,950
We left together

687
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,800
to practice.

688
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,530
I’m Li Sheng.

689
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,760
You’re lead...

690
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,830
I have an urgent message for Leader.

691
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,520
What is it?

692
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,920
Someone may attack

693
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,160
the Fortress.

694
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,040
Tell her to take precautions soon.

695
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,190
Who is it?

696
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,400
Timber Wolf?

697
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,830
20 years ago,

698
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:43,590
Old Master clobbered him.

699
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,070
Now,

700
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,610
he’s coming for revenge.

701
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,880
Give me a minute.

702
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,460
I’ll go get a carrier pigeon.

703
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,110
Thank you.

704
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,240
Please.

705
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,370
Don’t worry too much.

706
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,430
Once the message is sent out,

707
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,880
he’ll arrange a place for us

708
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,760
to rest.

709
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,300
What’s wrong?

710
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,470
I thought

711
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,070
you came to buy herbs,

712
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,870
but that man is actually
your secret contact.

713
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,220
I’m sorry that I didn’t tell you.

714
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,730
But relax.

715
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,290
This place is safe.

716
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,610
Something happened earlier.

717
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,880
What was it?

718
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,400
Back in Huarong,

719
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,830
many were killed

720
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:42,400
when Demons set our inn on fire.

721
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,000
Luckily, Fei and I were out

722
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,920
and we survived.

723
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,960
But they located us

724
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,920
because some secret contact

725
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,880
sold us out.

726
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,230
Really?

727
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,470
How come?

728
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,350
Fei and I witnessed everything.

729
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,040
They were in cahoots with those Demons.

730
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:03,960
What?

731
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,230
Think about it.

732
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,040
Before you said anything,

733
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,280
that owner brought up

734
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,430
Timber Wolf. Why?

735
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,520
Is your cousin

736
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,140
brain-damaged or what?

737
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,420
(Yuejing House)
Forget about her.

738
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,230
Let the kidnapper and the hostage

739
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,800
work things out themselves.

740
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,880
Cheer up.

741
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,040
Don’t worry too much.

742
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,040
We can stay

743
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,500
at Madam Nichang’s place

744
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,160
and wait for Yang Jin

745
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,730
and your cousin to come.

746
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,880
When he doesn’t see you,

747
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,470
he’ll get the message.

748
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,040
What do you know about the Cloud Ravine?

749
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,410
It’s located

750
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,110
in the south of Xinjiang

751
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,350
where there’s much greenery in miasma.

752
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,460
It’s not home to martial artists

753
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,810
but skilled physicians,

754
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,740
hence the nickname,
Small Medicine Valley.

755
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,560
He practices medicine!

756
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,110
There are always oddballs

757
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,400
in the family.

758
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,680
But Yang Jin

759
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,850
is the biggest among them all.

760
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,400
I guess

761
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,110
he can only tell radish from ginseng.

762
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,310
He’s obsessed with the blade skills

763
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,440
and he’s quite talented.

764
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,910
He must’ve

765
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,950
beaten all his peers up

766
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,400
to make himself

767
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,460
head of the Ravine.

768
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,450
He has

769
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,290
quite a background.

770
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,580
I know.

771
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,740
He’s started to
challenge others since long ago.

772
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,900
And he’s sort of a rising star

773
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,620
in the gloom.

774
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,640
I bet

775
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,920
he was also going after the title

776
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,290
of the number one blade.

777
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,830
Yet you popped out and snatched it away.

778
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,560
Of course he’s mad.

779
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,680
But

780
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,970
he isn’t too bad

781
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,330
and he’s done nothing evil.

782
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,290
I wasn’t after any title.

783
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,920
You don’t need to tell me that.

784
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,550
But what now?

785
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,000
How about

786
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,350
you surrender yourself to him?

787
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,710
I’ll accept his challenge.

788
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,980
(Miaoan Pharmacy)

789
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,400
Crap!

790
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,470
They’re gone!

791
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,040
Go after them!

792
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,160
-Yes.
-Yes.

793
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,350
It’s done. Taste it.

794
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,760
No, thanks. I’m good. You first.

795
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,110
Try it.

796
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,920
My roasted chicken wing

797
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,110
is tasty.

798
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,120
Why are you staring at me?

799
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,630
Is there something on my face?

800
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,710
No.

801
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,390
I’m surprised

802
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,000
that a well-cared-for girl like you

803
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,890
could show calm in times of danger.

804
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,310
That’s admirable.

805
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,990
As fragile as you look,

806
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,840
you’re

807
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,560
much tougher than I thought.

808
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,910
Not exactly.

809
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,520
Back in Huarong,

810
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,500
I couldn’t even run.

811
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,080
It was Fei
who protected me along the way.

812
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:47,910
She said

813
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:49,320
even if she died,

814
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,840
she’d be there for me as a ghost.

815
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,870
Then I thought to myself

816
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,190
how she could die.

817
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:56,280
She’d only die because of me.

818
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,720
I couldn’t let that happen.

819
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,000
Fei shouldn’t have

820
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,250
frightened you like that.

821
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,920
I wonder how she is now.

822
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,260
She will be fine.

823
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,710
She’s always been strong.

824
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:13,390
Although she grew up being whipped,

825
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:15,490
she turned out just fine.

826
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,160
You can stop worrying

827
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,070
as your cousin seems alright.

828
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,710
Anyway, you don’t want to battle him.

829
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,520
Since he’s after fame,

830
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,310
you can give in and let him have it.

831
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,460
Are you seriously
considering joining the battle?

832
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,520
Shouldn’t I?

833
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,800
I’ll be honest with you

834
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,840
if you won’t hit me.

835
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,430
You disapprove?

836
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,430
I see.

837
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,390
You’re aggressive and pugnacious

838
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,700
as your reputation suggests.

839
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,120
Xie Meimei,

840
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,450
why are you mad all of a sudden?

841
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,280
Yang Jin

842
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,230
isn’t invincible

843
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,210
but he’s one of the best.

844
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,150
I heard leaders of the major sects

845
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,080
all lost to him a few years ago.

846
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,000
You’ve just recovered

847
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,190
and you’re still weak.

848
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,320
How could you win him?

849
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:27,870
I’ll never know

850
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,390
if I don’t have a try.

851
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,230
In Mount Heng, you took the risk

852
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,190
to fight against Dragon Master
for justice.

853
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,320
I understand that.

854
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,560
But what’s this for?

855
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,120
I don’t care

856
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,340
about my own reputation.

857
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,230
If there’s a chance

858
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,190
to prove those rumors wrong

859
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,950
that I’m actually a nobody,
that’ll be good.

860
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,430
Why can’t you let that go?

861
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,670
Haven’t you noticed

862
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,280
that Chief Xu, Yang Jin,

863
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,670
Madam Nichang and the others

864
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,000
all refer to me

865
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,560
as South Blade

866
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,470
even though I’m a Zhou,

867
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,430
not a Li?

868
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,150
So?

869
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,380
So I don’t represent myself

870
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,870
but the respected

871
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,360
South Blade.

872
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,230
That’s merely

873
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,040
an empty title.

874
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,470
What’s the point of fighting for it?

875
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,680
Fine.

876
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,210
Let’s say you win.

877
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,950
Will that bring

878
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,200
your deceased grandfather back to life?

879
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,530
Alright.

880
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,430
Don’t mind what I said.

881
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,520
You can do whatever you want.

882
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,440
It’s none of my business.

883
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,550
Will Fei do it?

884
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,260
How can I talk her out of it?

885
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:03,390
Hey, do you know

886
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,710
when people die,

887
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,760
they’ll become stars in the sky

888
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,540
to protect the living ones.

889
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,560
My father and mother must be

890
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:13,740
looking at me and my brother right now.

891
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,190
My aunt said the same thing

892
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,500
when I was little.

893
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,670
She said my parents

894
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,670
would bless me and my sister in heaven.

895
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,400
But when I grew up,

896
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,640
I realized

897
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,760
people have

898
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,180
their own paths.

899
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,080
So you...

900
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,670
I lost my parents

901
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,030
when I was little.

902
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,680
I’m sorry.

903
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,890
You’re right.

904
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,510
We should take our own paths.

905
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,660
I’m lucky enough

906
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,950
to have met you all

907
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,540
who’re kind and helpful.

908
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,600
I don’t know how I can ever repay you.

909
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,730
Is Fei kind?

910
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,730
Aunt asked us to
take care of your family.

911
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,420
Although you’re alone,

912
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,060
trust me,

913
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:22,040
your safety is guaranteed.

914
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,840
When I saw Chenfei,

915
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,320
I was wondering

916
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,920
how my father made such friends.

917
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,360
After meeting you,

918
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,150
I can’t wait to go to your Fortress

919
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,730
and practice martial arts with you.

920
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,830
The night sky is beautiful.

921
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,840
Look!

922
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,230
It is.

923
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,810
(Plum Liquor)
Eat up, Xie Yun.

924
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,170
Do you know how terrible your smile is?

925
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,470
For an average-looking girl like me,

926
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,960
it’s natural that my smile isn’t pretty.

927
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,230
So what’s this about?

928
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,760
Xie Yun,

929
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,630
I apologize

930
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,360
for upsetting you yesterday.

931
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,670
Are those words

932
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,600
at your fingertips right now?

933
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:57,450
I can easily tell you aren’t sincere.

934
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,000
I’m sorry

935
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,470
that I was impulsive.

936
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:11,080
Just because you’re
from a prominent family

937
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:11,870
doesn’t mean

938
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:14,080
you can walk all over
an honest man like me.

939
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,800
You’re right.

940
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,360
My bad.

941
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,000
I’ll punish myself.

942
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,820
That’s more like it.

943
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,760
So will you battle him or not?

944
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,800
I will.

945
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,840
No, I won’t. I won’t.

946
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,760
This Plum Liquor is rich in aroma.

947
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,130
No wonder it’s famous.

948
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,040
Yesterday,

949
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:59,190
you told me about
the Small Medicine Valley.

950
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,300
Is there a big one?

951
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,050
There was.

952
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,630
The Big Medicine Valley

953
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,470
was known for medicine and poison.

954
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,840
The small one copied

955
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,090
most of their stuff.

956
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,000
Is that so?

957
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,940
Yes.

958
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,050
Sadly,

959
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,190
Demons slaughtered the big one.

960
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,560
Tons of their poisons and antidotes

961
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,260
got lost.

962
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,210
Why ask?

963
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,080
I’m wondering

964
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:43,120
what skills Yang Jin practices.

965
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,470
I knew it!

966
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:50,240
There is no such thing as a free meal.

967
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:51,800
I’m off.

968
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:53,290
Keep the liquor to yourself.

969
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,080
Master, it’s been confirmed

970
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,280
that Yang Jin is clean.

971
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,080
He’s an enthusiastic martial artist

972
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,470
but he’s never injured the innocent

973
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:14,560
or made any enemies.

974
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,290
He has no connections with anyone.

975
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,800
In that case,

976
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:22,530
he is challenging Zhou Fei for fame.

977
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,910
I suppose.

978
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,000
How ironic that it’s happening again!

979
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:34,120
How could I sit and watch

980
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,670
the youngsters

981
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,670
risking their lives for useless titles

982
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:42,800
after the North Blade

983
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,760
challenged Mr. Yin years back?

984
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:51,430
Master,

985
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:53,520
even if Mr. Yang releases the hostage,

986
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,760
it’s still up to Miss Zhou

987
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,040
to accept his challenge or not.

988
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:11,520
That’s a familiar smell.

989
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:15,150
Is it Fei again?

990
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,390
Smells so good.

991
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,330
What an evil trick!

992
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,520
Fei, you’re a bad girl.

993
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:36,060
(Plum Liquor)

994
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,370
Hello.

995
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:45,560
You’re still up this late.

996
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,630
Would you like to drink with me?

997
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:00,120
Hey, pretty, you sit outside

998
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,520
a man’s room

999
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,230
with fine liquor.

1000
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:04,720
Do you know what message you’re sending?

1001
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,390
I’ve decided to battle Yang Jin

1002
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:10,370
and I need your help.

1003
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:14,720
That’s it?

1004
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:27,040
What’s that?

1005
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,230
Please do me this favor.

1006
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:39,040
Sorry,

1007
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,710
unless you’re a goddess,

1008
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:43,430
just leave me alone.

1009
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:44,520
Excuse me.

1010
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,130
What are you doing?

1011
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:49,690
