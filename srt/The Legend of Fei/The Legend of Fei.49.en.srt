Why can’t the patterns match

18
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,950
no matter how I observe?

19
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,350
Fei.

20
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,670
Screwed.

21
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,190
Why is her breath stagnating?

22
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,190
Am I going to die?

23
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,040
Screwed! She’s trapped in it.

27
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,910
Seems like I’m getting close

28
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,400
to the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

29
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,240
Listen.

30
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,680
If you want to live,

31
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,910
you...

32
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,070
Open the Color of Ocean and Heaven
for me.

33
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,630
You overestimate me, Lord Shen.

34
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,680
It’s such an important thing.

35
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,960
I don’t know how to open it.

36
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,760
You’re Chongxiao’s disciple.

37
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,030
You must know many mechanisms
of Qi School.

38
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,840
You opened the entrance
to the Forbidden Hall,

39
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,030
didn’t you?

40
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,680
I’ll get to the point, then.

41
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,470
I can open it for you.

42
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,190
But you must promise me three things.

43
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,030
First,

44
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,070
let them leave safe and sound.

45
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,350
Second,

46
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,750
I’ll take away
the Book of Almighty Medicine.

47
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,520
You can keep the rest of things.

48
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,630
Third,

49
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,400
I’ll tell you later.

50
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,440
You think I can’t open it

51
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,720
after I kill all of you?

52
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,590
That’s right.

53
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,720
You can’t open it.

54
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,070
Why am I back again?

55
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,720
Zhou Fei.

56
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,000
Somehow,

57
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,070
this is your destiny.

58
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,750
It’s also Xie Yun’s.

59
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,440
No. I don’t believe in destiny!

60
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,590
Fine.

61
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,400
I promise.

62
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,030
You can’t escape

63
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,070
or change anything.

64
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,630
Everything is illusion.

65
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,190
Everything is destined.

66
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,870
Why do you still struggle?

67
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,840
I never yield to

68
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,840
any so-called destiny!

69
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,240
I need five tokens
for the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

70
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:20,800
Yin and Yang reinforce each other.

71
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,070
Methods of Qi School
originated from Eight-trigram.

72
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,470
All mysteries are contained

73
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,280
in the Eight-trigram.

74
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,710
Qian, three Yang.
Heaven in the northwest.

75
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,830
Kun, six Yin. Earth in the southwest.

76
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,200
Earth in the southwest.

77
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,910
Dui, three Yin on the top.
Two lakes in the west.

78
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,000
Two lakes in the west.

79
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,440
Xun, three Yin on the bottom.
No wind in the southeast.

80
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,200
Zhen, six Yin on the top.
Four thunders in the east.

81
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,470
Hope the last one is right.

82
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,760
Grass grows in dry earth.

83
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,240
Fire melts ice and brings water.

84
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,080
How can you survive
if you don’t know this place?

85
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,030
Wake up.

86
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,880
Fei.

87
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,470
Wake up!

88
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,880
Fei, are you alright?

89
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,440
You were trapped just now.

90
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,390
I did?

91
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,510
I left the Method of Qi School.

92
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,640
It’s dangerous,
which easily kills people.

93
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,350
What’s wrong with Lyu Run?

94
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,760
He asked us to be careful in the end!

95
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,910
Who could see that?

96
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,440
How mean he was!

97
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,560
All right, Weed Spirit.

98
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,030
I’m glad you’re fine.

99
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,640
Let’s try to get out of here.

100
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,800
I’m freezing.

101
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,440
Okay.

102
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,950
Let’s go.

103
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,880
Come on.

104
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,900

105
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,140
(Refinement of Iron)

106
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,820
(Book of Almighty Medicine)

107
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,560
What’s happening?

108
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,920
Go.

109
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,080
Lord Shen.

110
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,830
Book of Almighty Medicine.

111
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,640
When I was at your age,

112
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,510
I realized something.

113
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,640
I must strive for

114
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,120
whatever I want.

115
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,560
I’m a grateful man.

116
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,800
You opened this place for me.

117
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,710
I’ll keep you alive.

118
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,000
Don’t play tricks with me.

119
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,390
Go.

120
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,680
Aye.

121
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,710
Kill!

122
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,000
All of them!

123
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,760
Aye.

124
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,300
(Book of Almighty Medicine)

125
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,640
Young girl.

126
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,240
You have good martial arts.

127
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,270
Shut up and give me the book!

128
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,710
What’s happening?

129
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,030
What’s happening?

130
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,440
Lord, sounds like

131
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,030
it came from the Forbidden Hall.

132
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:43,880
Fei.

133
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,910
Go!

134
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,000
Fei, go!

135
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,910
Don’t mind me. Just go!

136
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,880
Go!

137
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,880
The mechanism is triggered.

138
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,470
This place is collapsing! Leave!

139
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,640
Go!

140
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,800
Hurry!

141
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,880
Go!

142
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,950
The door is cracked. Go this way.

143
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,120
Fei, don’t worry too much.

144
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,120
Mr. Xie will be alright.

145
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,440
I know.

146
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,800
He won’t be dying for the moment.

147
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,150
But...

148
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,440
Ying Hecong.

149
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,360
Keep half of the Book
of Almighty Medicine.

150
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,840
Okay.

151
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,110
Sheng.

152
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,320
Take them to a safe place.

153
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,600
I’ll go find Xie Yun.

154
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,800
I think this is what Shen Tianshu wants.

155
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,720
Lord.

156
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,510
There were all kinds of treasures

157
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,030
in the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

158
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,360
Why did you only get this book?

159
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,600
In old days,

160
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,960
the blacksmith who made me the iron hand

161
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,910
had wonderful skills.

162
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,720
He made my iron hand

163
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,270
into a magic weapon.

164
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,910
Unexpectedly, he told me

165
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,270
a far better way of iron refinement

166
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,800
than what he could do.

167
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,960
Compared to weapons made of that,

168
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,870
my iron hand

169
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,600
can be nothing.

170
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,800
I searched it for years.

171
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,800
At last,

172
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,360
I knew Huang Shenbian put it

173
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,750
in the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

174
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,200
Actually so magic?

175
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,270
It’s said that

176
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,800
weapons made by Refinement of Iron

177
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,840
will be sharp

178
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,680
and flexible.

179
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,800
If we have such weapons...

180
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,990
We will

181
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,150
be all-conquering.

182
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,080
But...

183
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,390
Lord.

184
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:29,200
We only have half
of the Refinement of Iron.

185
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,510
But we have Xie Yun.

186
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,600
We will get the other half back.

187
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,560
Track Shen Tianshu to find Xie Yun.

188
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,990
You neither eat nor drink.

189
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,390
Don’t you feel bad?

190
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,320
I can’t run away.

191
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,680
Why don’t you go have something to eat?

192
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,840
Stop talking and behave yourself!

193
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,320
Well.

194
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,150
How did you join the Demons Manor?

195
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,440
Shen Tianshu has poor character

196
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,030
and he’s mean to others.

197
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,680
How about this?

198
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,510
I know the men with Liu’s Manor.

199
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,390
I can recommend you to them.

200
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,630
You like to worry a lot.

201
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,110
Such a wilderness

202
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,870
is far worse than your previous palace.

203
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,870
Sorry for that, Your Majesty.

204
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,150
It doesn’t matter.

205
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,080
I just feel

206
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,270
your manor is declining.

207
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,510
I also worry about you.

208
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,200
You’re still alive,

209
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,720
only because you’re useful to me.

210
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,960
Looks like the half book Fei has taken

211
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,600
matters a lot to you.

212
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,910
What is that book?

213
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,480
Too much wisdom will hurt you.

214
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:20,990
Your friend is coming soon, I guess.

215
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,750
Xie Meimei.

216
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,750
Are you alright?

217
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,600
I’m fine.

218
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,150
Fei, where’s the other half of the book?

219
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,910
Here.

220
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,800
Refinement of Iron?

221
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,200
What’s this?

222
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,870
Do you remember the steel refinement

223
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,750
I told you last time?

224
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,440
It’s recorded in the Refinement of Iron.

225
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,230
With this book,

226
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,870
incomparably sharp weapons can be made.

227
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,320
No way.

228
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,230
We can’t let Shen Tianshu have it.

229
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:31,720
But...

230
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:32,990
We need the other half
of Book of Almighty Medicine

231
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,200
from him.

232
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,600
Since Shen Tianshu

233
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,080
racks his brains to get this book,

234
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,870
why don’t we turn his trick
to our own use?

235
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,320
Can you recite it?

236
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,910
Don’t worry.

237
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,720
Screwed! It’s a trap!

238
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,230
Let’s get back!

239
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,750
-Go!
-Go!

240
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,750
Report!

241
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,360
Report!

242
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,510
Lord.

243
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,440
Someone broke into the room
where Xie Yun was kept.

244
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,720
But...

245
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,960
They might fail to unshackle him.

246
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,990
Xie Yun is still there.

247
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:49,870
Bring him to me.

248
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,390
I’ll guard him personally.

249
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,390
Aye.

250
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,230
You...

251
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,560
Take some men
to search the Big Medicine Valley

252
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,150
and find out where they’re hiding.

253
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,440
Aye!

254
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,360
You appeared like a ghost.

255
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,480
You freaked me out!

256
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,840
Where’s Xie Yun?

257
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,360
Mr. Ying.

258
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,510
Can you get enough information

259
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,030
from the half Book of Almighty Medicine?

260
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,080
Bone-chilling is the No.1 poison.

261
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,080
Based on half of the book,

262
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,870
I can’t figure out
the complete antidote.

263
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,720
I need the other half.

264
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,510
I understand.

265
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,320
Do you?

266
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:01,990
Ying Hecong.

267
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,480
Where are you going?

268
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,630
Many herbs are needed
for the antidote to Bone-chilling.

269
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,390
In the Big Medicine Valley,

270
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,870
there must be many precious herbs.

271
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,600
I’ll go and get some.

272
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,510
But we don’t even know

273
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,990
how many Demons are still in the Valley.

274
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,080
It’s too dangerous for you to go.

275
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,870
I know.

276
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,870
But the poison on Mr. Xie can’t wait.

277
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,360
I must make the best use of my time.

278
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:18,990
I’ll be careful.

279
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:19,870
Don’t.

280
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,960
Wait. Wait.

281
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,150
I heard you.

282
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,440
I’ll go with you, too.

283
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,320
Let’s go and come back early.

284
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,440
-Go.
-Go.

285
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,910
Lord Shen.

286
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,910
You keep an eye on me personally.

287
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:55,110
This is really a bit awkward.

288
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,870
Lord, Zhou Fei has come again.

289
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:07,990
How many people came with her?

290
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,560
She came alone.

291
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,150
Go!

292
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,150
Zhou Fei.

293
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,990
You dare to come alone.

294
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,630
It’s brave of you.

295
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:46,750
Shut up and let’s get to the point.

296
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,750
I’ll exchange
the other half of Refinement of Iron

297
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,320
for Xie Yun
and Book of Almighty Medicine.

298
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,960
Good. Deal then.

299
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,150
Where’s the other half?

300
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,800
Look. It’s what you want.

301
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,440
Refinement of Iron is gone now.

302
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,870
But Lord Shen, don’t be angry.

303
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,600
Xie Yun has recited

304
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,270
the other half of Refinement of Iron.

305
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:38,840
Forge the pig iron into wrought iron.

306
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,200
It becomes steel in a couple of days.

307
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,440
Make the iron
into the back of the blade.

308
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,510
Bathe it with animals’ feces

309
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,720
and melt it with animals’ fat.

310
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,600
It will cut thirty layers of armors.

311
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,150
(Forge the pig iron into wrought iron.)

312
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,600
What?

313
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,990
Is this what in your book?

314
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:05,630
You tricked me again.

315
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,360
Fine.

316
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,870
Forge a blade

317
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:14,270
with what you’ve recited.

318
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,440
I only accept the blade.

319
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,840
When the blade is done,

320
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:23,110
you’ll have Xie Yun

321
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,230
and the Book of Almighty Medicine.

322
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:28,150
Okay. It’s a deal.

323
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:41,600
Come on.

324
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,910
This is for you.

325
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,480
We’re looking for precious herbs.

326
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,560
We must search carefully.

327
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,990
You’re right. I’ll go have a look.

328
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,150
I’ll go with you.

329
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:49,990
No!

330
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,840
The Big Medicine Valley is so big.

331
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,750
It’ll be faster if we go separate ways.

332
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,560
You’re right. Let’s go separate ways.

333
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,270
I’ll go that way.

334
00:28:58,870 --> 00:28:59,680
Be very careful.

335
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,630
I see.

336
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,480
I’m going that way, then.

337
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,510
Ying Hecong.

338
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,510
Wait a second.

339
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,440
What?

340
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,230
I...

341
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,080
Nothing.

342
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,440
I’ve got something very precious

343
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,960
to entrust you.

344
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,960
As the saying goes,

345
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,440
something unexpected
may happen at any time.

346
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,600
I’m a man who fights every day.

347
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,390
If I die someday,

348
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,840
I’m afraid I have no one

349
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,390
to entrust the precious thing with.

350
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,230
Very precious?

351
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,230
Does he mean

352
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,110
Li Yan?

353
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,750
Do you promise me?

354
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,440
Yes.

355
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,750
Yes. Yes. Yes.

356
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,600
Fine.

357
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,680
You can’t go back on your words!

358
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,840
A real man never goes back on his words!

359
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,840
The very precious thing I mean

360
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,140
is to be the Chief
of Small Medicine Valley.

361
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,940
(Medicine)

362
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,390
Bonehead.

363
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,600
I don’t want this!

364
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,800
You said a real man wouldn’t
go back on your words.

365
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,110
Be a real man if you want.

366
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,390
But I don’t want that.

367
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,720
There are so many herbs in the Valley.

368
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,910
If I have the other half
Book of Almighty Medicine,

369
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,990
I may also be a miracle physician.

370
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,720
Why didn’t I study hard back then?

371
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,630
Yan.

372
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,630
After everything is over,

373
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,360
go back to the South with me, okay?

374
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,480
Screwed! Screwed!

375
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,560
Screwed! Screwed!

376
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,230
The Demons are coming!

377
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,870
Let’s leave!

378
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,320
-Go!
-But, you...

379
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,320
Get out of the way!

380
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,200
I can’t stop.

381
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,960
Get out of the way!

382
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,480
You look so sweet.

383
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,840
Where are the others?

384
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,840
Tell us where they are

385
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,960
and I can spare your lives.

386
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,110
How dare you ask! Defeat me first.

387
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,720
Defeat you? Who are you?

388
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,560
You don’t know who he is?

389
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,630
He’s the owner of Cloud Ravine,

390
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:41,320
known as Bonehead Blade of the South.

391
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,510
The Strongest Blade!

392
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,960
Whatever.

393
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,600
A big name indeed.

394
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,720
Kill them!

395
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,560
You have good martial arts.

396
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,110
I underestimated you.

397
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,840
Hou what?

398
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,560
Hou You.

399
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,080
Never heard of it.

400
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,080
I’m a capable assistant of Lord Shen

401
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,630
with Demons Manor.

402
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,230
It’s so ignorant of you!

403
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,390
What You?

404
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,870
Hou You!

405
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,200
Go!

406
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:26,910
Retreat!

407
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,440
Xiao Chuan.

408
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,840
You should have been an emperor.

409
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,150
But now you’re forging a blade for me.

410
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,600
Shen Tianshu.

411
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,080
Why do you insist on being a dog,

412
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,990
instead of a human?

413
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,800
Not a dog,

414
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,390
but a wolf.

415
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,360
Tonight,

416
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,480
I’m in good mood.

417
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:05,360
I’ll teach you
how to behave in this world.

418
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:11,400
We can’t be a real strong man

419
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,710
unless we go through all difficulties.

420
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,160
A real strong man

421
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,160
not only has great martial arts.

422
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,230
He also cares for the world,

423
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,230
protects its people,

424
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,400
and is respected.

425
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,510
Shen Tianshu.

426
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,360
You have the best martial arts, so what?

427
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,800
You’ll be notorious
for the time to come

428
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,030
and be forever cursed.

429
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,670
I don’t care.

430
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,600
Yan.

431
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,920
I wanted to tell you something.

432
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,400
After everything is over,

433
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,990
go back to the South with me.

434
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,470
I want to be with you.

435
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:49,400
What...? What do you think?

436
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,640
I’m serious.

437
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,780
(Youhuang)

438
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,320
Youhuang?

439
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,710
Lord Shen.

440
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,920
The blade is done.

441
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,120
But it needs the last procedure.

442
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,990
Give me the Book of Almighty Medicine.

443
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:47,750
Or the blade will be ruined.

444
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,710
Fine.

445
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,190
I’ll keep my promise.

446
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,160
Here it is.

447
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,230
Fine.

448
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,270
Let’s do the last procedure.

449
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,800
Let me do it.

450
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,120
Done.

451
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,600
Get me the blade.

452
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,400
Aye.

453
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,600
Lord, here’s the blade.

454
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,640
Fei.

455
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,120
Go.

456
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,600
It’s really a sharp blade.

457
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,400
Fei.

458
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,640
You’re finally out.

459
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,920
What happened to him?

460
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,670
Let’s get back first.

461
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,430
Okay.

462
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,640
I set traps here.

463
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,880
The Demons won’t catch up
in a short while.

464
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,230
Come with me. Come on.

465
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,950
You’re awake?

466
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,230
How do you feel?

467
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:17,430
I’m fine. I’m just tired.

468
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,840
Are you really fine?

469
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:29,360
Yes.

470
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,600
Screwed! Screwed!

471
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,750
Something is wrong with the other half.

472
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:37,880
What is wrong?

473
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,840
Some words are erased

474
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,160
from the book.

475
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,320
What can we do to make up for it?

476
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,600
I can only figure out the antidote

477
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,640
by guessing the context.

478
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,400
We’ll fight poison with poison.

479
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,510
If I use one single wrong herb,

480
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:54,030
he will not live.

481
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,360
So, I can’t be more cautious.

482
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,080
I’ll go review it again.

483
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,710
Fei.

484
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,950
Shall we go back
to the Fortress of the Forty-Eight?

485
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,430
Even if I must die,

486
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:12,270
I want to die in a beautiful place.

487
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,160
Don’t talk nonsense.

488
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,710
Fine.

489
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,120
Let’s go home.

490
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,160
Yan.

491
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,270
Yan.

492
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,670
I bring you something to eat.

493
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:42,230
Yan.

494
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,840
Were you unhappy

495
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,670
for what I said yesterday?

496
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,430
How annoying! Why do you keep asking?

497
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,840
I’ve made myself so clear.

498
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:57,160
Why do you still not understand me?

499
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,710
I... I understand you.

500
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,120
I just don’t know how to reply.

501
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,600
Going to the South is something big.

502
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:07,270
You agree?

503
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:10,710
I’ll just visit the South with you.

504
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:12,510
Fine. Fine.

505
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:13,990
Whatever you say.

506
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,510
Okay.

507
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,400
Have some, too.

508
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:36,180
(Book of Almighty Medicine)

509
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,420
(Bone-chilling)

510
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,510
I’ve got an idea!

511
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:54,670
Zhou Fei! Zhou Fei!

512
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:57,160
I’ve got an idea for the antidote!

513
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:01,750
Come over. Keep your voice down.
He’s asleep.

514
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:02,880
What did you say?

515
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,670
I’ve got an idea for the antidote.

516
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:05,320
Really?

517
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,400
Yes. Yes.

518
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,030
Uh...

519
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:09,510
I’ve got a problem.

520
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:10,800
The last herb...

521
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,320
I’m not sure

522
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,800
if it’s Dry Grass or Dry Sprout.

523
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:17,360
I thought about testing them on animals.

524
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,270
But no animals

525
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:20,990
can stand such strong effect.

526
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,560
Well.

527
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:25,950
What about humans?

528
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,190
Try them on me.

529
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,990
Okay?

530
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,080
No.

531
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,230
I’m a physician.

532
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:38,950
I can’t kill someone for saving another.

533
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:40,230
Zhou Fei.

534
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:41,840
You’re a healthy girl.

535
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,920
If the antidote goes wrong,

536
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,160
you’ll be ruined.

537
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,470
No more nonsense.

538
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,190
Just try them on me.

539
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:52,560
Zhou Fei.

540
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:55,990
You want to save him with your own life.

541
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:59,160
Is it worth it?

542
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,400
It is.

543
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:06,640
Don’t tell anyone else.

544
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,190
Okay.

545
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,800
I’ll get the antidote ready soon.
