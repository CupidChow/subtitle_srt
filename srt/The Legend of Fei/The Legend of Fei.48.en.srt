Watch strictly over that direction.

19
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:38,590
It’s there.

20
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,310
-Keep a close eye.
-Aye.

21
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,510
There are too many of them.

22
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,630
We can’t break in.

23
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,230
What’s in the barrels?

24
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,000
That’s where we store the kerosene.

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,800
Be quick.

26
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,160
It’s a good thing.

27
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,550
Tell us.

28
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,190
Where are your companions?

29
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,440
I don’t know!

30
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,000
Stay away from me!

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,630
If you don’t tell us,

32
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,310
I’ll kill you!

33
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,230
Go!

-Stop running!

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,960
Hurry.

41
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,520
Leave.

42
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,240
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Thank you.

43
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,800
We were told

44
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,600
that our granaries were targeted.

45
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,000
You two, keep a close eye on it.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,030
Don’t let anything go wrong.

47
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,670
Otherwise,

48
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,960
you would be beheaded!

49
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,160

-Aye!

-Go! Go!
-It’s the village!

53
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,830
It’s the village!

54
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,520
Look over there.

55
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,440
Go.

56
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,680
Lord Lu.

57
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,910
Your sister Pathetic Clam died
when stealing the tokens.

58
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,870
Shen Tianshu discarded her
as a chessman.

59
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,280
But you’re still fighting for him.

60
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,800
Is it worth it?

61
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,520
What a loser you are!

62
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720
Weed Spirit.

63
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,070
You saw the mark?

64
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,630
Yes.

65
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,720
-Fei.
-Fei.

66
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,590
Well done!

67
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,560
Gu Tianxian.

68
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,470
You’d better be killed by me

69
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,240
than be defeated by our enemy.

70
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,190
Don’t disgrace us.

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,070
Kill them all!

72
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,240
What’s happening?

73
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,030
Retreat!

74
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,520
I’m back.

75
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,560
Chuchu.

76
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,680
You’re finally back.

77
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,960
Are you alright?

78
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,310
I’m fine.

79
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,400
Thank you, everybody.

80
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,800
Miss Wu, you’re welcome.

81
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,960
It’s General’s Wen’s order.

82
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,560
I should do my best.

83
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,240
Everyone.

84
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,960
I’m leaving, then.

85
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
Let’s go!

86
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,310
-Aye!
-Go!

87
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,190
Hurry!

88
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,520
What do we do next?

89
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,280
So many Demons fail

90
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
to get any clue
for the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

91
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,720
I think we should start from the poem.

92
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,400
Sheng.

93
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,870
Did you find something?

94
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,070
The sun shines

95
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,560
over that place.

96
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,800
There are birds

97
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,000
on the tree.

98
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
The valley is beautiful,

99
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,000
where birds sing beautifully.

100
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,000
Does the second half refer to a place

101
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,440
where the sun shines

102
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,070
and the birds sing?

103
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,030
Precisely.

104
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,440
I think that’s the place

105
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,000
the poem refers to.

106
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,280
Let’s go there.

107
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,000
-Go.
-Go.

108
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,220
(Frost after autumn rains.
Coolness and silence in the forest.)

109
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,590
Run!

110
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,750
Run, everybody!

111
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,630
Help!

112
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,680
-Run!
-Run!

113
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,520
-Help!
-Run, everybody!

114
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,590
Run!

115
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,350
Help!

116
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,150
Be careful!

117
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,510
-Come on.
-Hurry! Run!

118
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,640
Lord.

119
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,440
These villagers ran away
from the Big Medicine Valley.

120
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,800
Seems like

121
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,200
not everything is under control
of Giant Leopard and Hearing Ox.

122
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,350
Someone strong must have gone there

123
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,640
and disturbed them.

124
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,270
Someone held back two lords
at the same time?

125
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,320
In this world,

126
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,270
there are very few people

127
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,240
who have such great martial arts.

128
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,560
Could it be...?

129
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,150
Go.

130
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
Aye.

131
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,320
If I guess correctly,

132
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,150
this is the entrance

133
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,560
to the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

134
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,640
Sheng.

135
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,150
Did you get it wrong?

136
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,440
It doesn’t look like an entrance.

137
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,710
It’s a mere forest.

138
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,080
If Mr. Li is right,

139
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,680
the entrance can’t be opened
unless we find the mechanism.

140
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,470
You’re right.

141
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,880
Let’s look for it.

142
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,910
Report!

143
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,560
Lo... Lord.

144
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,350
Zhou Fei and her companions
haven’t left the Big Medicine Valley.

145
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,320
Instead, they got into the forest.

146
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,000
They escaped, but didn’t leave.

147
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,150
Can they be looking for something?

148
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,080
Follow them.

149
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,030
If you find anything fishy,

150
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,200
tell me immediately.

151
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,470
Aye.

152
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,640
What did you press?

153
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,000
A stone over there.

154
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,240
That’s the mechanism.

155
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,710
It looks like a musical instrument,

156
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,800
named...

157
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:35,910
Xun.

158
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,120
Lingxun comes from four directions.

159
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,830
Lingxun?

160
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,760
Did I remember it in a wrong order?

161
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,950
It should be Xunling.

162
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:46,760
That explains.

163
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,880
There’s another name for Xunling,

164
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,950
the sound of Xun.

165
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,440
It means

166
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,150
four songs are played.

167
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,440
There are another four places like this.

168
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,440
Where are the other three directions?

169
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,910
According to the Eight-trigram
Formation map,

170
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,440
it should be the east, west and south.

171
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,390
Well,

172
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,350
let’s go separate ways.

173
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,030
Let’s look for them separately

174
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,590
and come back later.

175
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,320
After all the troubles,

176
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,350
we’re finally going to find
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

177
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,080
We’re not sure what will happen.

178
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,120
The farther we go,
the more cautious we should be.

179
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,030
Miss Zhou.

180
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,080
Don’t worry.

181
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,590
I’ve had a divination lately.

182
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,270
We’re destined to stay

183
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,150
and help each other.

184
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,270
As long as we’re together,

185
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,950
we will turn ill luck into good.

186
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,320
If you’re actually good at divination,

187
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,120
why don’t you find the mechanism first?

188
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,680
Here’s my good luck.

189
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,680
I’ve found it.

190
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,590
Let’s go.

191
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,800
Chuchu.

192
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,680
When I left, you gave me a pouch.

193
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,030
What was that for?

194
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,150
I used to keep the pouch with me,

195
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,710
which blessed me from danger.

196
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,710
I gave it to you,

197
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,640
so that you would be safe.

198
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,880
Sorry.

199
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,150
I made you worried again.

200
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,950
Look.

201
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,440
There’s some noise.

202
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,800
You know what?

203
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,470
The mechanism must be in the rocks.

204
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,510
We can’t easily find it.

205
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,910
Think about Lyu Run.

206
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,150
He designed the entrance

207
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,080
with the Eight-trigram Formation.

208
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,510
He was awesome.

209
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,150
What an idiot you are!

210
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,030
If it hadn’t been for him,

211
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,150
we would have found
the Color of Ocean and Heaven long ago.

212
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,470
Stop talking nonsense.

213
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,710
Hurry and look for the mechanism.

214
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,910
Come and have a look.

215
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,910
Is this the mechanism?

216
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
Try it.

217
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,390
Come over.

218
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,150
-Hurry.
-Hurry.

219
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,470
Look!

220
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,080
The entrance has appeared!

221
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,800
Why is this

222
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,710
the Forbidden Hall of Qi School?

223
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,510
Can the Color of Ocean and Heaven
be in this place?

224
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,760
Be careful, everybody.

225
00:15:58,950 --> 00:15:59,910
Go.

226
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,510
Tiankuang.

227
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,390
-Lord!
-Lord!

228
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,830
You look serious.

229
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,800
What’s on your mind?

230
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,590
Lord.

231
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,950
You’re just in time.

232
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,000
I’ve possibly found the entrance

233
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,800
to the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

234
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,200
Let me take you there.

235
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,720
Where birds sing beautifully.

236
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,230
It’s indeed the place.

237
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,440
Ying Hecong.

238
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,440
What are these?

239
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,680
Five Poison Saints.

240
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,800
Five Poison Saints?

241
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,560
They’re evil gods in the south.

242
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,990
Villagers who believe in witchcraft
pray to them

243
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,270
so that they won’t be hurt
by poisonous insects.

244
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,030
But later,

245
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,510
some bad men used them

246
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,320
to pretend to be mysterious.

247
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,870
Many weird pictures are on the wall.

248
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,320
What do they mean?

249
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,230
I can’t recognize all the marks.

250
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,150
I can only have a guess.

251
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,440
It’s about a totem

252
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,230
or a sacrifice.

253
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,030
Look at this picture.

254
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,200
This man died.

255
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,750
Their priest brought him

256
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,990
back to life

257
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,440
by using a book.

258
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,990
Is it the Book of Almighty Medicine?

259
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,910
Perhaps.

260
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,030
Here’s a door.

261
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,230
Let’s go have a look.

262
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,150
Be careful with your blade.

263
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,560
Everybody, look out
for the wall and ground.

264
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,080
Bonehead.

265
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,440
Seems like this place

266
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,320
extends to the valley.

267
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,960
I wonder where
the Color of Ocean and Heaven is hidden.

268
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,720
In this place, there are many formations

269
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,910
and secret chambers.

270
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:26,910
If we’re careless,

271
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,630
we may trigger the mechanism

272
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,230
and be caught in danger.

273
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,320
So...

274
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,230
-Fei!
-Xie Yun!

275
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,560
Fei!

276
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,150
They fell in a mechanism.

277
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,600
Let’s search the place
and see if we can open it.

278
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,680
Yes. Let’s look for the mechanism.

279
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,680
Okay.

280
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:06,990
Watch out!

281
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,990
Mechanisms are everywhere.
It’s too dangerous.

282
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,800
Let’s move forward.

283
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,720
Be very careful.

284
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,910
-Okay.
-Okay.

285
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,840
Sheng.

286
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,720
Sheng! Chuchu!

287
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,030
Yan!

288
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,480
We’re in trouble.

289
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,030
What are you sighing for?

290
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,870
I didn’t expect Dim

291
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,750
to be so fragile as well.

292
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,720
It already has cracks and cuts
on the edge.

293
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,960
You don’t use blades. What do you know?

294
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,270
Dim has been the best blade

295
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,960
I’ve ever used.

296
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,200
Where’s Ying Hecong?

297
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,680
Isn’t he behind us?

298
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,150
He didn’t catch up?

299
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,440
Wait a minute.

300
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,030
Don’t you think we’re circling?

301
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,270
Can Ying Hecong be lost?

302
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,800
Let’s go find him.

303
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,630
Wait a second.

304
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:33,990
There’s some noise.

305
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,480
What are you doing?

306
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,600
Why are you there?

307
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,800
Come this way.

308
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,150
Please.

309
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,110
Guard at the entrance

310
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:24,030
with your men and private soldiers.

311
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,150
Don’t let anyone come out.

312
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,230
Aye, Lord.

313
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,990
Shen Tianshu

314
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,680
is so vigilant against me.

315
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,230
The door can’t be opened.

316
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,960
Why is here a stone chamber?

317
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,030
Yeah.

318
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,480
All daily necessities are available.

319
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,630
Looks like someone once lived here.

320
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,320
This is underground.

321
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,480
Who could have lived here?

322
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,150
Door.

323
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,510
There’s a door over there!

324
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,840
Let’s go have a look.

325
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,150
Be careful.

326
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,230
Watch out for traps.

327
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,030
Someone must try it.

328
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:54,200
You... You go.

329
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,960
Fine, then!

330
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,150
Be careful.

331
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,480
The door can’t be opened.

332
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,390
There must be another mechanism.

333
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,960
It’s icy.

334
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,440
No wonder it feels so cold here.

335
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,910
Weed Spirit.

336
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,840
I guess the one who lived here

337
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,110
must be fat and afraid of heat.

338
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,840
That’s why he lived here.

339
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,840
Why are you still kidding?

340
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,720
No way. Your body feels cold.

341
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,030
We can’t stay here for long.

342
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,750
Let’s check if there’s another exit.

343
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,780
(I’m not jealous of immortals,
but the lovers)

344
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,270
(Painted in the spring of the 35th year,
by Lyu Run)

345
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,910
It’s a painting of Priest Lyu Run.

346
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,080
Lyu Run?

347
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,230
Lyu Run is said
to have found a secret place

348
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,630
where nobody knew

349
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,270
to get ready for his death.

350
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,910
I think

351
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,270
this is where he stayed before he died.

352
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,150
Lord.

353
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,680
The arrow was cut.

354
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:08,630
They must have triggered the mechanism.

355
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,910
Let’s go separate ways.

356
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:12,640
Lord.

357
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,520
Mechanism here was triggered, too.

358
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,070
Seemed like someone was here.

359
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,910
Get in and have a look.

360
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:23,910
Aye.

361
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,840
In the Forbidden Hall of Qi School,

362
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,110
there are many mechanisms.

363
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,080
But there’s no decent treasure at all.

364
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,720
Lord.

365
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,870
This painting is wrong.

366
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:16,200
The old man on the right
uses white chessmen.

367
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,990
But he’s hesitating with a black one.

368
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,440
You have no idea.

369
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,870
Lyu Run was forever engrossed
in pharmacology and martial arts.

370
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,630
He was so obsessed

371
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:43,200
that he even remained within doors
when he was old.

372
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,750
The chess game in the painting

373
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,680
is very likely to be the true faith

374
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,270
he got in his twilight years.

375
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,750
True faith?

376
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,750
We don’t know why he destroyed it.

377
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,630
What a pity!

378
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,480
I practiced martial arts

379
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,440
in both Yin and Yang ways,

380
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,720
just like the black and white chessmen.

381
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,150
The last level should be Yang.

382
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,030
I abandoned Yin,

383
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:26,800
trying to make a breakthrough in Yang.

384
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,600
According to the painting,

385
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,800
I use the white chessmen,

386
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,910
but I guess about the black.

387
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,270
Don’t touch it.

388
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,720
What if it’s poisonous?

389
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,030
I’m impervious to all poisons, aren’t I?

390
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:18,750
I lost my father at a little age.

391
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,360
My master adopted me

392
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,910
and named me Run.

393
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:25,320
I was raised and educated.

394
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,840
Run?

395
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,360
It’s Lyu Run’s testament, I guess.

396
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,440
No wonder
we saw the statue of poison saints

397
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,510
when we came in.

398
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:43,480
It’s said
that his lover died of sickness.

399
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,750
Lyu Run was so overwhelmed with grief.

400
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,080
Therefore,

401
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,230
he spent his whole life
studying medical skills,

402
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,200
trying to figure out

403
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,840
if there’s a real way
to bring the dead back to life.

404
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,600
Did he find anything

405
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,320
after studying books of poison saints
for such a long time?

406
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,320
Phoenix Grass was from ancient times.

407
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,870
There is little available in this world.

408
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:08,870
I made all Phoenix Grass into pills

409
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,360
and put them all in this box.

410
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,080
Taking a few of them

411
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,230
and digesting them
with extreme Yang force

412
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,800
will detoxify all poisons.

413
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,360
There’s no more Phoenix Pill.

414
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,800
It opened automatically!

415
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,600
Not automatically. I opened it!

416
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,270
Can it be opened?

417
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,440
No one is here.

418
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,510
We’re stuck here.

419
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,150
These are extreme Yin things

420
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,990
we can hardly see in a century.

421
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,360
So many!

422
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,150
It’s a dead end.

423
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,870
Shall we backtrack?

424
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,320
Let’s go.

425
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,840
Ying Hecong.

426
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,990
Look what a condition we’re in!

427
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,600
Why are you still
checking the moldy herbs?

428
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,990
Help to look for the exit.

429
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:22,750
It’s Yan’s voice.

430
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,960
Yan!

431
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,360
Yan!

432
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,270
Since we can hear her voice,

433
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,440
it means there’s a crack.

434
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,800
If there’s a crack, there’s a mechanism.

435
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,270
Let’s look for it.

436
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,270
Okay.

437
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,960
Bonehead.

438
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:06,030
This looks like a mechanism.

439
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,030
Try it.

440
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,150
Why is it me again?

441
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,030
Ying Hecong.

442
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,750
Here’s a mechanism. Come and turn it.

443
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,270
Oh, you can do it.

444
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,510
Just do it. Hurry.

445
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,870
It can’t be turned.

446
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,360
This can’t be a mechanism.

447
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,560
Let’s keep looking.

448
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,150
Look at this.

449
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,270
Looks like it was pushed.

450
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:06,840
Yan.

451
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,600
Sheng, keep the door open!

452
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,030
Are you alright?

453
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:13,870
We’re fine.

454
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:16,560
The door is the only exit here.

455
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,720
Anything special in this chamber?

456
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,080
No.

457
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,150
Oh, Sheng.

458
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,680
Did you see Fei and Xie Yun?

459
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,630
No.

460
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:24,750
Our priority

461
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,480
is to find Fei soon.

462
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,750
I’ve got to know

463
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,390
about the mechanisms.

464
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,320
Remember.

465
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,150
Do no touch anything.

466
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,110
-Go.
-Go.

467
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,320
Report!

468
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,270
Lord.

469
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,150
Li Sheng and his companions
are right ahead.

470
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,720
Go.

471
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,750
-Aye.
-Aye.

472
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,030
-Go.
-Go.

473
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,270
What a complicated place!

474
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,230
I’m a bit dizzy, walking around.

475
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,030
I didn’t expect to meet you so soon.

476
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,800
It’s you?

477
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,080
Young girl.

478
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:31,320
Where’s Zhou Fei?

479
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,430
You’re the mastermind
who poisoned my aunt!

480
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,320
I’ll avenge her today!

481
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:36,990
Yan.

482
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:38,640
We can’t defeat him. Go.

483
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,880
Let them lead the way.

484
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,270
What’s this book?

485
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,950
Methods of Qi School.

486
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,190
It looks like Tao Teh King

487
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,750
Taoist Priest Chongxiao gave me.

488
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,670
But...

489
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,270
The second half looks different.

490
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,880
Fei.

491
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,160
I didn’t expect the method

492
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,230
to be so strong and fiery.

493
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,510
It is.

494
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,030
This book looks strange.

495
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,640
You’d better stop reading.

496
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,430
Fei.

497
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:56,030
This method feels so strange.

498
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,430
Stop reading it.

499
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:57,950
I’m afraid you will...

500
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,990
We have no other way.

501
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,670
We can’t get out, anyway.

502
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,120
I’d like to have a try.

503
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,270
Chuchu just pulled it open.

504
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:34,190
Let me push it!

505
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,230
Help me.

506
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,560
Push it harder!

507
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,600
I am…

508
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,560
Do you need any help?

509
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,840
We’ve got many more men.

510
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,950
Come and try

511
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:53,470
if you’re not scared of the mechanisms.

512
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,800
Push it hard!

513
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:01,560
Go on with it.
I’ll hold them back.

514
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,400
Attack!

515
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,840
Come and help me!

516
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,230
It’s open. Hurry! Go.

517
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,270
Go!

518
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,710
Are you alright?

519
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,510
Why is here another door?

520
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,950
No wonder it’s a place of Qi School.

521
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,080
A school has many doors.

522
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,080
The two stone phoenixes by the door

523
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,160
could be the mechanism to the door.

524
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,080
One on the left
and the other on the right.

525
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,560
A real one and a false one.

526
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,920
If we pick the false one,
we’ll trigger the trap.

527
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,840
There are mechanisms and doors.

528
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,670
Why do smart people like you

529
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,320
always do such complicated things?

530
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,670
You’re just too stupid to understand!

531
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,750
Go.

532
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,400
They’re right ahead. Hurry.

533
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,160
It’s too late.

534
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,920
Pick one and try our luck.

535
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:58,950
What...

536
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:07,190
It’s open.

537
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,840
If we could easily guess the right one,

538
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,360
it wouldn’t be a mechanism.

539
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,120
Go!

540
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,710
They’re over there. Block the door.

541
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,840
Yang Jin, give me your blade.

542
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,880
Stop him!

543
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:37,430
Lord, I was too slow.

544
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,600
Lord, here’s a mechanism.

545
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,320
Watch your steps.

546
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:29,880
Since there are so many mechanisms,

547
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,320
there must be hollow parts

548
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,840
in the walls.

549
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,670
They could be the fragile area.

550
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,840
Go find it out.

551
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,600
-Aye.
-Aye.

552
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,230
Look for it!

553
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,270
What’s that?

554
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,120
I’ll go have a look.

555
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,190
These patterns

556
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:13,320
look a bit familiar to me.

557
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,080
Stop looking.

558
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,920
Smash the door open.

559
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,710
Aye.

560
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,560
Shen Tianshu is catching up.

561
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,920
We can’t pin him down

562
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,120
unless we find
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

563
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,670
Stop.

564
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,430
Knock again here.

565
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:12,190
Smash it.

566
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:12,990
Aye.

567
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,750
What are the Demons doing?

568
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,190
Pulling down the chamber?

569
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:27,320
Apparently, they’re trying to break in.

570
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,800
I don’t think it’s so easy

571
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,510
to break through the walls.

572
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,750
Mechanisms are everywhere.

573
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,270
The walls may be hollow.

574
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,400
If they keep smashing,

575
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,880
the walls will be broken soon.

576
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:36,430
Fei.

577
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,880
Fei, what’s wrong?

578
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,510
What happened to me?

579
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:42,430
I can’t even speak.

580
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,360
Fei.

581
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,920
Feels like

582
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,120
all my energy is being extracted
by the strong method.

583
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,360
I’m having less energy.

584
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:06,120
Why is this happening?
It doesn’t feel right.

585
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,230
Sheng, what did you find?

586
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:14,230
There are five patterns on the wall.

587
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:17,160
The one in the middle seems
to be half missing.

588
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:25,600
This half, I guess.

589
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,920
Stop.

590
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,400
Why can’t the patterns match

591
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,920
no matter how I observe?
