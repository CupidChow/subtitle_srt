That’s my grandfather.

55
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,070
He and the Mountain Sword

56
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,160
had admired each other for long.

57
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,660
Maybe that’s what they say

58
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,600
like knows like.

59
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,510
You could fight as long as you like,

60
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,920
but why did you break your weapons?

61
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,110
Stop! What’s there to laugh?

62
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,270
What a pity!

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,320
Miss,

64
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,950
someday,

65
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,320
when you find

66
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,040
your like-minded friend,

67
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,480
you’ll understand

68
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,550
why we’re laughing.

69
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,390
Weapons can be broken

70
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,640
but not the friendship.

71
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,110
The South Blade

72
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,440
and the Mountain Sword

73
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,790
lost their weapons together.

74
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,000
How ironic!

75
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,640
Then I returned to the Yuyi Troupe

76
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,550
and had someone

77
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,160
make replicas

78
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,830
of the weapons

79
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,920
they used.

80
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,110
Before I had the chance to give them,

81
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,110
I heard

82
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,720
some rich guy in Penglai

83
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,510
gave Master Yin
a suit of armor and a sword.

84
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,920
Thinking that

85
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,350
those priceless treasures

86
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,760
were much better

87
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,600
than my cheap replicas,

88
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,790
I decided not to embarrass myself.

89
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,160
Unexpectedly,

90
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,760
two years later,

91
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,320
I couldn’t see them ever again.

92
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,160
So,

93
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,640
as Master Li’s granddaughter,

94
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,880
I want you to take this blade

95
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,480
to help you practice.

96
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,070
I don’t need it anymore.

97
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,640
After all,

98
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,270
it’s what I owe your grandfather.

99
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,230
Thank you.

100
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,000
I’m old and nagging

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,720
that I told you so much
about the past.

102
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,640
Sit back.

103
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,320
I still have questions for you.

104
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,670
Who taught you the Mayfly Moves?

105
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,950
Well,

106
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,440
when we

107
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:18,760
left the dungeon in Huo’s Manor,

108
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,440
we ran into a Taoist priest
of the Qi School.

109
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,440
He taught me that.

110
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,230
What about Dragon Master?

111
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,440
Did you kill him?

112
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,110
No.

113
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,920
I just stalled him

114
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,390
to buy time for Master Ji.

115
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,480
He forcibly rebuilt his veins

116
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,830
by the Soul-searching Needle

117
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,170
and finished Dragon Master.

118
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,270
You and Qian Suiyou...

119
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,200
We also

120
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,880
met in the dungeon.

121
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,280
She saved me, to be precise.

122
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,370
You were there, too?

123
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,510
They couldn’t have

124
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,880
hired you to arrange a play, could they?

125
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,390
Stop pretending, young lady.

126
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,070
As far as I know,

127
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,160
you’re asked

128
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,760
to escort the late General Wu’s children

129
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,320
to your Fortress by Leader Li.

130
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,920
Is there anyone else with you?

131
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,320
Qiu Tianjin was hunting us

132
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,200
in Huarong like crazy

133
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,520
for a reason.

134
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,000
He must be after something

135
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,480
Chuchu has.

136
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,950
I can’t leak that out

137
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,600
no matter what.

138
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,390
I’m asking you.

139
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,000
I...

140
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,040
Something happened

141
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,210
and I got separated from my family.

142
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,200
Fei,

143
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
you’re spoiled.

144
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,470
What happened?

145
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,150
I was treated unfairly

146
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,840
by my parents

147
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,030
because I am a girl.

148
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:06,030
I got mad and left

149
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:11,670
and ran into Chuchu

150
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,030
who followed me out.

151
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,790
Later,

152
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:20,230
when I saw bandits robbing passengers,

153
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,910
I became furious

154
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,280
and...

155
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,400
and interfered.

156
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,640
I chased the bandits

157
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,910
and ended up in that dungeon.

158
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,640
How come?

159
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,760
I thought parents

160
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,400
would care more about girls.

161
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,760
You know,

162
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,400
when I was about your age,

163
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,520
I was well cared for.

164
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,910
Unlike you,

165
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,670
she has a rough childhood.

166
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,520
Alright, it’s late.

167
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,710
Hey,

168
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,440
you haven’t slept well lately

169
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,000
and you’re still weak.

170
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,880
Go back and get some rest.

171
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,080
You still

172
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,550
have a long way ahead.

173
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,400
Good night.

174
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,350
Good night.

175
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,080
Wenlan,

176
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,440
as Zheng expected,

177
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,520
his daughter gave birth

178
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,110
to a pretty and smart girl.

179
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,570
She’s tough enough

180
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,910
to pass down his Snow-breaking Blade.

181
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,200
I wonder

182
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,030
how that boy is.

183
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,220
(Cortex Dictamni)

184
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,280
Hand over the scabbard of the
Mountain Sword if you want to live!

185
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,150
No way,

186
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,710
unless you kill me first!

187
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,790
Who is it?

188
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,880
You’re awake as expected.

189
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,230
Mr. Chongxiao said you’d wake up soon.

190
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,640
Who?

191
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,710
Mr. Chongxiao,

192
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,640
the one who saved you.

193
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,280
He saved me

194
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,470
only to steal my scabbard, didn’t he?

195
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,520
What?

196
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,470
Nothing. Take me to see him.

197
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,280
Let’s go.

198
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,440
Let go of me.

199
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,440
-Where are your manners?
-Let’s go. Come on.

200
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,590
Let go! Where am I?

201
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,230
Mr. Chongxiao’s house
is on the mountaintop.

202
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,520
Who is Mr. Chongxiao?

203
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,000
Chongxiao is his name.

204
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,280
What’s this place?

205
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,200
Mr. Chongxiao said

206
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,910
this is where
the Big Medicine Valley was

207
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,110
but got deserted for long.

208
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,520
Now, it’s a shelter for the homeless.

209
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,710
A shelter for the homeless?

210
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,960
Yes.

211
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,470
More like a base for his own force.

212
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,200
By the way, I’m Xiaohu.

213
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,670
I’m also homeless.

214
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,910
Unlike the others,

215
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:19,910
I’m responsible for

216
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,350
taking care of Mr. Chongxiao

217
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,590
as he insists on living alone.

218
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,230
So I come here regularly.

219
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,550
Are you also homeless?

220
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,760
None of your business.

221
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,670
Relax. Don’t worry.

222
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,880
From now on, this is your home, too.

223
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,230
And what’s your name?

224
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,150
You have too many questions!

225
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,550
Follow me.

226
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,470
Where to?

227
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,110
-You...
-Come on.

228
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,550
Do you know what you’re doing?

229
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,910
Do you know who I am?

230
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,030
I don’t care.

231
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,670
Let go of me! Let go!

232
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,790
Mr. Chongxiao,

233
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,230
he’s awake.

234
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,670
Finally.

235
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,840
You must be hungry coming out of a coma.

236
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,080
Do I know you?

237
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Taoist Priest Chongxiaozi.

238
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,470
I held you when you were little.

239
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,520
You even peed on me.

240
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,790
Another friend of my father’s.

241
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,110
He had friends

242
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,350
all over the world.

243
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,280
Yes, he did.

244
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,030
Swords represent gentlemen,

245
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,790
and the Mountain Sword tops all.

246
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,320
I’m not sure

247
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,320
if your fathers’ skills
are second to none,

248
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,640
but no one

249
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,740
deserves to be called
a gentleman other than him.

250
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,000
A gentleman?

251
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,400
Yes.

252
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,000
He was too gentle

253
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,640
to see through others’ lies.

254
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,520
I’ve met tons of

255
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,270
his so-called friends.

256
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,400
They’re all after my family heirloom.

257
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,400
Hey,

258
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,030
how could you say that?

259
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,320
Mr. Chongxiao saved you!

260
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,710
He saved me?

261
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,110
For what?

262
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,440
First, you saved me.

263
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,080
Then you’d take me in as your disciple

264
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,080
and teach me skills, right?

265
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,470
Is there anything new?

266
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,600
Which animal taught you skills?

267
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,910
You were born weak

268
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,590
and injured internally.

269
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:36,440
You aren’t fit to practice any skills.

270
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,390
You’re a terrible liar.

271
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,350
Others would offer me something,

272
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,550
yet you wouldn’t give me any.

273
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,470
You’re worse than them.

274
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,420
You know if I’m lying or not.

275
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,200
When you try to mobilize your strength,

276
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,080
do you feel your energy running wild,

277
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,880
your body numb
and hands and feet trembling?

278
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,760
Can you practice skills

279
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,640
like this?

280
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,760
I don’t feel anything.

281
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,060
You’re talking nonsense.

282
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,830
You don’t?

283
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,330
No.

284
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,230
Xiaohu,

285
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,520
take him to go get water.

286
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,350
You’re back.

287
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,930
You can’t wait any longer, can you?

288
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,510
Just quit it.

289
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,560
I’ve brought the scabbard with me.

290
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,710
Son,

291
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,490
I’m sorry for all your suffering.

292
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,950
Drop your act.

293
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,000
Although you saved me,

294
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,310
I don’t believe

295
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,040
you’d do that to a stranger

296
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,160
for nothing.

297
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,310
I did it for your father’s sake.

298
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,880
Otherwise,

299
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,160
as idle as I was,

300
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,520
I wouldn’t have gone

301
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,950
all the way to look for you

302
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,590
simply based on hearsay.

303
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,640
Go on.

304
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,310
Keep going.

305
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,110
This is

306
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:54,040
your father’s letter to me.

307
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,470
Read it.

308
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,380
(Priest Chongxiao,
I heard chaos is rising.)

309
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,780
(About what you mentioned last time...)

310
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,880
That’s his handwriting.

311
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,040
They say you’re what you write.

312
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,470
Your father’s handwriting

313
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,160
is smooth and well-honed.

314
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,950
Obviously,

315
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,640
he practiced long and hard.

316
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,350
No one

317
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,710
could copy his style.

318
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,760
(Sincerely, Yin Wenlan)
Look at Li Zheng.

319
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,560
(Sincerely, Yin Wenlan)
Although he was a top martial artist

320
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,640
and established his own sect,

321
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,950
his family was inferior to yours

322
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,710
in terms of literary attainments.

323
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,430
What a pity!

324
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,190
What a pity!

325
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,880
Why?

326
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,670
My family isn’t gone.

327
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,110
I, Yin Pei, am still alive!

328
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,280
That’s right.

329
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,820
You’re also a Yin.

330
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,040
Your physique is poor,

331
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,800
but you aren’t too dull.

332
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,830
There’s still hope
to restore your family’s reputation.

333
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,230
My physique isn’t poor!

334
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,230
Didn’t you get it

335
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,040
when carrying the water?

336
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,110
You aren’t even as strong

337
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,640
as a kid.

338
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,560
Believe it

339
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,000
or not,

340
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,400
you’d better

341
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,670
not use or practice any skills again.

342
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,400
Or the bloodline of the Yin family

343
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,310
stops at you.

344
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:53,540
(Qiaoyun House)

345
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,220
(Xianglan Room)

346
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,750
The Snow-sinking Blade is gone, too.

347
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,690
Stop looking. They’ve all left.

348
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,290
Yuyi Troupe does this all the time.

349
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,430
It’s still warm.

350
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,880
You can’t make them stay.

351
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,640
Why they insist on leaving?

352
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,460
Because...

353
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:51,280
Because it’s a secret.

354
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,680
That’s utter nonsense!

355
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,280
Are you killing your dear...?

356
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,760
Dear friend?

357
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,160
Are you my friend?

358
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,760
You’re mine.

359
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,520
Miss Zhou.

360
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,800
Have some tea.

361
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,040
Yuyi Troupe and Mingfeng Building

362
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,040
in your Fortress

363
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,800
were neck and neck over ten years ago.

364
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
It’s their rule

365
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,190
to leave quietly.

366
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,070
I understand.

367
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,590
Fei,

368
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,950
what are you going to do next?

369
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,710
What else?

370
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:34,520
I’ve been out for so long.

371
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,870
It’s time to go back home

372
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,150
and practice my skills.

373
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,830
Can you

374
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,770
take me back with you?

375
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,920
Can’t you walk?

376
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,400
Do I have to carry you?

377
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,640
Alright.

378
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,640
Who?

379
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,110
Yang Jin has just left.

380
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,220
Is someone else coming to challenge me?

381
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,040
Anyone?

382
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,880
Mr. Ma!

383
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,310
Fei!

384
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,760
Mr. Ma,

385
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,230
you had no idea what I went through.

386
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,280
You know

387
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,830
that bonehead and old fogy

388
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,350
cheated me, held me hostage

389
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,590
and threatened me
in order to battle Fei.

390
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,880
Held you hostage?

391
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,710
Threatened you?

392
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,830
You were well-fed there

393
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:25,160
and you look round.

394
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,830
How come Leader

395
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,830
let you out?

396
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,310
Did you act up again?

397
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,710
No, Fei.

398
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,830
I can explain.

399
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,070
Those stories they told

400
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,950
made me proud of you.

401
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,110
Yan,

402
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:40,800
what were you thinking

403
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,510
by going out alone to hear stories?

404
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,800
Luckily, Yang Jin didn’t harm you.

405
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,350
He only meant to challenge Fei.

406
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,640
Otherwise,

407
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,160
what should I

408
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,280
and Fei

409
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,000
say to Leader

410
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,980
and the deceased Old Master?

411
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,760
Sit back.

412
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,280
Sit down.

413
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,760
Now, you’re crying?

414
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,920
Zip it! No more tears.

415
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,920
Calm down.

416
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,290
We’re all safe.

417
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,230
Fei,

418
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,590
who is he?

419
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,310
The one who kidnapped uncle.

420
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,520
What?

421
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,230
He’s a friend.

422
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,710
A friend?

423
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,310
I did deliver a letter

424
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,280
to Lord Gantang,

425
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,820
but I’m no kidnapper.

426
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,640
I first met Fei

427
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,680
in the dungeon in Huo’s Manor.

428
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,330
Since then
we’ve been traveling together.

429
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:49,870
That’s right.

430
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,090
Hey, where’s Sheng?

431
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,920
He...

432
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,000
He got separated from us

433
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,110
right after we set off.

434
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,790
I don’t know where he is now.

435
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,000
Look at you!

436
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,190
You’re a bunch of troublemakers!

437
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,710
I’ve had enough.

438
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,830
Now that you’re back,

439
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,880
do not

440
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,640
leave again.

441
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,350
I’ll go pack up.

442
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,800
Let’s go home.

443
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,880
Sure.

444
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,910
Are we leaving so soon?

445
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,110
Are you done,

00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,310

(Kelai Tailor’s Shop)

We’re close to Chunhui Town

449
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,400
and we should be safe for now.

450
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
Why don’t you get changed?

451
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,160
I should.

452
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,400
It’s better to meet Leader Li

453
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,160
in a dress.

Welcome, sirs.

00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,640
What can I offer you?

457
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,980
She needs a dress.

458

I’m sorry, Miss.

459

What about this one?

464
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,710
I just finished it earlier today.

465
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:31,000
You’ll look great in it.

466

I’ll take care of the carriage

Thanks, Mr. Ma.

471
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,190
I’m leaving.

472
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,280
Be careful.

473
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,800
I will.

474

Fei, what’s that shop?

Let’s go take a look.

477
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,640
I think

478
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,000
they sell snacks.

479
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,820
Really?

480
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,930
Would you like some?

481

Come on. Let’s go.

482
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,230
Toys.

483
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:22,070
-Have a look.

485

I made a mistake.

486
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,680
The snack shop might be that way.

487
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,310
Over there?

488
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,920
Haws on a stick.

Jili, you’re back.

492
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,160
Hello.

493
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,110
Have you got what I asked for?

494
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,400
All ready.

495
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,760
Let me see.

496
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,280
They are cheap

497
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,640
but made of fine fabric.

498
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,560
See for yourself.

499
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,350
I know.

500
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:00,190
Mr. Ma, why do you need cheap clothes?

501
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,400
Nothing. Nothing really.

502
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,350
It’s hard to be a father.

503
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,470
He’s away from home all the time

504
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,520
and tries to save
as much money as he can.

505
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,400
But the kids need new clothes,

506
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:09,880
so he asked me...

507
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,640
Alright. Enough.

508
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,920
Say no more.

509
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,280
Here’s the money.

510
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,920
Hold on.

511
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,880
That’s too much.

512
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,000
Not at all.

513
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,590
I know you’re being kind

514
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:21,160
by telling me they’re cheap,

515
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,590
but I can’t

516
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,710
take advantage of you.

517
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,160
If you don’t take the money,

518
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,190
I won’t ask you

519
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,760
for the unsold stock again.

520
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,400
-Take it.
-Fine.

521
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,230
I’ll take it.

522
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,710
Bag them all.

523
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,280
Fei.

524
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,230
Sir,

525
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,040
may I pick it up and have a look?

526
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,920
Sure. Of course.

527
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:58,950
Mr. Ma,

528
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,000
will I look good in this?

529
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:05,880
Yes.

530
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,280
Of course, Fei.

531
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,070
Am I right?

532
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,520
Hey,

533
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,310
take my advice

534
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,880
and dress yourself up.

535
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,520
You’ll look so pretty.

536
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,350
You know what,

537
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,350
you and my eldest daughter

538
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,000
are about the same height and weight.

539
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,680
That’s right.

540
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,310
In that case,

541
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,110
what suits me

542
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,760
also suits her.

543
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,310
Take this as a gift.

544
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,800
No, Fei.

545
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,350
Bag it, sir.

546
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,280
-This is too much.
-Here’s the money.

547
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,160
It’s expensive.

548
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,230
You shouldn’t do this.

549
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:34,000
Mr. Ma, just take it.

550
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,470
You’ve been taking care
of me along the way.

551
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,160
If Mother knows
I didn’t thank you properly,

552
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,430
she’ll call me ungrateful.

553
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,680
Fei, it’s just too much.

554
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,110
I cannot have it.

555
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,070
Just take it and go home

556
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,350
for the kids to try on.

557
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,160
It’s the least we should do.

558
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,160
Take it.

559
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,520
Take it.

560
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,950
Thank you. Thanks.

561
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:56,520
Thanks, Fei.

562
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,280
You’re welcome.

563
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,280
That was generous of you
but I was going to

564
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,430
buy you a make-do blade
with that money.

565
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,520
You owe me a better one

566
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,560
than a make-do blade.

567
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,110
Write another song and sell it,

568
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,540
then you can afford it.

569
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,870
I won’t take anything
less than this one.

570
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,880
Aren’t you picky?

571
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:30,230
Have some tea.

572
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,590
Young man,

573
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,400
are you with the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight?

574
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,880
How do you know?

575
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,000
That’s easy.

576
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,400
Your look tells me

577
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,230
you’re a martial artist

578
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:45,040
and the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

579
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,350
is the only sect in this area.

580
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:49,160
There are no other sects.

581
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,830
I must say you’re lucky.

582
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:57,350
Although your wife dresses up as a man,

583
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,640
she’s obviously,

584
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,760
a lady.

585
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,520
You mistook us.

586
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,760
She’s not my wife.

587
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,680
I’m so sorry.

588
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,040
Have some tea.

589
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,590
Sheng,

590
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,400
do I look good in this?

591
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,000
Yes. Absolutely.

592
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,470
Ma’am,

593
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,230
I’ll take this one.

594
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,280
Young man,

595
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,920
go pick something for yourself.

596
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,400
Oh, no,

597
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,280
I’m dizzy.

598
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,420
Get some rest.

599
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,100
Are you alright?

600
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,160
Ma’am,

601
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,850
whose horse is it outside?

602
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,070
It’s mine.

603
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,560
Could you sell it to me?

604
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,680
Sure.

605
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,660
(Chunhui Inn)

606
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,160
We’re close to the Fortress.

607
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,430
Why are we resting here

608
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,950
instead of going uphill?

609
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,160
Fei,

610
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,760
don’t tell me

611
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,470
you’re waiting to get a good look

612
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,950
of your home before going back.

613
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:47,960
What’s there to look?

614
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,800
Is that my home or yours?

615
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,110
It’s dark

616
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,350
and misty in the woods.

617
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,110
We would’ve got lost.

618
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,590
And...

619
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,560
Well...

620
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,110
Uh...

621
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,470
Do a headcount and make a list of names.

622
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:11,160
Get all your badges ready.

623
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,400
Give the list and badges

624
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,710
to the first checkpoint before entry.

625
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,710
Yes.

626
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,520
On top of that,

627
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,560
all members must
go through identity checks.

628
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,740
There will be...

629
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,110
There will be...

630
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,350
What?

631
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,280
Our own members

632
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,760
will be checked twice.

633
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,430
The process will be slightly
complicated for strangers,

634
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,880
including authorization
by at least one Elder.

635
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,470
That will take two to three days.

636
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,680
Correct.

637
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,880
Mr. Ma is right.

638
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:45,640
No wonder.

639
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,830
Alright, everyone, go get prepared.

640
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,600
Yes.

641
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,230
Let’s go.

642
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,840
Brace up and tidy up.

643
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,560
Mr. Ma,

644
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,350
I’m ready.

645
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,590
When can we eat?

646
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,640
I’m starving.

647
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,070
Just a minute.

648
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:10,680
Mr. Xie, you’ve been to our place once

649
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,470
and you must be familiar

650
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,190
with the checks and the rules.

651
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,920
What are you doing? Come here.

652
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,640
Come over. Why are you here?

653
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,280
Let go!

654
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,400
You people are rude!

655
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,110
Say that to yourself!

656
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,520
You already lost to Fei.

657
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,830
Why are you stalking us?

658
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,560
Speak!

659
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,160
What are you up to?

660
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,210
Nothing.

661
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,590
Greetings, head of the Cloud Ravine.

662
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,160
You abducted my cousin

663
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,680
to force me to battle.

664
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,620
You lost and started to tail us.

665
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,350
Are you

666
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,110
going to abduct one of us again?

667
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,830
You won by luck!

668
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,110
Let’s practice in your Fortress

669
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,800
and I’ll challenge you again.

670
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,310
Even my mother
isn’t so keen on my practice.

671
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,640
Why can’t he

672
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,560
give up and let me go?

673
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,950
You didn’t listen
when I said not to battle him.

674
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:13,150
Look. You can’t get rid of him.

675
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,080
You shouldn’t be here. Get out now!

676
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,190
Do you know what this place is?

677
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,600
You aren’t welcome here.

678
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,230
And

679
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,190
you haven’t paid the price

680
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,630
for abducting me.

681
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,520
You...

682
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:25,600
You people...

683
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,080
When you were under my roof,

684
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,120
I treated you as a princess.

685
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,520
Were that called abduction,

686
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,870
many would die for such treatment.

687
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,800
You don’t own this place.

688
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,870
I’m not leaving.

689
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,560
You... You...

690
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,520
What are you doing?

691
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,600
I can’t believe

692
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,360
the South Blade’s offspring is a thief.

693
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,120
I didn’t steal it.

694
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,630
I simply took it.

695
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,040
Just like you took me

696
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,320
for your own purpose.

697
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,470
Give it back!

698
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:58,080
Give it to me!

699
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,870
No way.

700
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,360
That must be important.

701
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,280
So,

702
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,430
what is it?

703
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,150
Say it, or I’ll toss it away.

704
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,910
That’s the Five-bat Token
of the Route Gang.

705
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,390
When traveling with that token,

706
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:15,040
the Route Gang

707
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,170
will take care of everything on the way.

708
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,230
It’s quite useful.

709
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,520
Keep it, Fei.

710
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,320
I don’t need it.

711
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,390
Just take it

712
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,560
as a prize

713
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,190
for winning that bonehead.

714
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,670
Thanks.

715
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,560
Feel free to stay here.

716
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,630
You can’t enter the Fortress anyway.

717
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,630
Look what you’ve done!

718
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,800
I’ll talk to him.

719
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,120
He’s the head
of the Small Medicine Valley.

720
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,600
Better not make enemies with him.

721
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,120
Behave yourself.

722
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,430
He kidnapped me!

723
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,280
Look what the cat drags in.

724
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,120
Mr. Yutai.

725
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,190
What brings you here?

726
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,670
To pay respects to you, of course.

727
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,600
How have you been?

728
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,670
I eat three fish per meal.

729
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,910
You tell me.

730
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,430
Your sense of humor never dies.

731
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,040
Come here.

732
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,840
Let’s chat here.

733
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,990
I received a letter
to the head of Mingfeng.

734
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,470
I thought it was addressed to me,

735
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,760
so I opened it.

736
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,320
Here it is.

737
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,430
(Yu Wenzhi Bai)

738
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:11,320
What will come will come.

739
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,670
What do you think

740
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,360
we should do?

741
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,040
I didn’t know the whole truth

742
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,190
about Mingfeng’s retreat

743
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,080
other than the fact

744
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,000
that we offended a powerful force.

745
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,230
The letter

746
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,710
we received

747
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,810
shows they intend to make peace.

748
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,710
I wonder if there’s more to it.

749
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,000
Whatever it is,

750
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,760
if they attempt

751
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,080
to provoke us,

752
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,230
we should let them know

753
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,800
they’re making a mistake.

754
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:58,040
It’s been so long.

755
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,670
If we can clear the air,

756
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,430
That will be good.

757
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,150
That way, we can stop holing up

758
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,670
with nothing to do.

759
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,040
You have a point.

760
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,430
But,

761
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,560
back then, you’d

762
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,320
do anything

763
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,630
to avoid being a spy.

764
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,630
You refused to be one.

765
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,390
Now,

766
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:26,390
you seem to have changed your mind.

767
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,190
Well,

768
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,320
the past is the past.

769
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,390
All I want is to

770
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,150
restore Mingfeng to its former glory.

771
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,000
I see.

772
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,430
The thing is

773
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:47,390
those famous spies

774
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,760
all ended up dead, didn’t they?

775
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,820
Those of the Yuyi Troupe

776
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,810
are the only survivors

777
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,640
because they’ve quit.

778
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:02,800
Now, they’re selling
information instead.

779
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,040
That’s actually not bad.

780
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,140
At least, they’re still alive.

781
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,610
Whichever path you take,

782
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,510
the most important thing

783
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,180
is to choose your direction.

784
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,150
Let’s pretend

785
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,910
we’ve never seen this letter.

786
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,280
Yes, I understand.

787
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,040
Good day.

788
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:49,910
Dan,

789
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,050
where did you

790
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,840
get this letter?

791
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,870
Someone gave it to our member

792
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,560
who went out to do grocery shopping.

793
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:04,400
They must have been
staking out for long.

794
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,630
Had I

795
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,870
had any ill intentions,

796
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,520
I wouldn’t have shown the letter to you.

797
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,760
I know.

798
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,760
Lord Gantang.

799
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,280
General Wen.

800
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,570
Didn’t you bring him back?

801
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,410
No, I’m afraid,

802
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,660
but His Highness is safe.

803
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,320
It’s just that

804
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,360
Miss Zhou Fei

805
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,800
seems unwell.

806
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,870
So have I been told

807
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,670
by the scouts

808
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,230
I sent to gather information.

809
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,390
I failed in my duty

810
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,390
to bring His Highness
and Miss Zhou back.

811
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:43,230
It’s not your fault.

812
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,710
There isn’t much we can do.

813
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:51,280
Luckily, Mr. Xie is resourceful

814
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,800
and Fei is always blessed.

815
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,340
Those two

816
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,950
can look after each other

817
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,190
and get out of the woods.

818
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:03,910
I’m sure

819
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:05,430
Miss Zhou will be fine.

820
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:09,670
I hope so.

821
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:11,520
Lord Gantang,

822
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,390
there’s one more thing.

823
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,870
I ran into Gu Tianxian at Mount Heng.

824
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,360
Gu Tianxian?

825
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,390
He’s with the Demons Manor.

826
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:31,630
What was he doing there?

827
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,910
I was confused, too.

828
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,670
Soon after I found Miss Wu,

829
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,710
we were attacked by Demons.

830
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,870
Your nephew Li Sheng

831
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,600
helped us out.

832
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,000
Then Gu Tianxian and his men

833
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,190
left for somewhere,

834
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,840
later known to be Hengyang,

835
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,760
according to Miss Wu and Li Sheng.

836
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,230
Someone was waiting for him there.

837
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,230
Report!

838
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,120
Lord Gantang,

839
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,710
we still haven’t heard anything

840
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:56,840
about the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

841
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,760
I see.

842
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,800
You may leave.

843
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,600
Yes.

844
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,230
Gu Tianxian must have gone to Hengyang

845
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:13,280
for a reason.

846
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:15,470
General Wen,

847
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,190
I received a tip-off a few days ago,

848
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:21,600
saying Yu Wenzhi
had been spotted at Demons Manor.

849
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:26,230
With Gu Tianxian in Hengyang,

850
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,500
unrest is growing everywhere.

851
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,360
There must be more

852
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,000
under the table.

853
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,360
Lord Gantang,

854
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,360
do you mean those two are...

855
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:43,910
I wish I were wrong.

856
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,390
Mr. Yutai.

857
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,190
While Leader is away,

858
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:08,230
I came to check
the Spinning Wire Formation.

859
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,520
Here.

860
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:42,710
Let’s drink.

861
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,630
Fei,

862
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:49,760
people from the Fortress

863
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,000
will probably arrive tomorrow.

864
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,840
Guards at the checkpoint said

865
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,630
Leader had gone out.

866
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:56,710
So the security

867
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:58,560
becomes tighter.

868
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,670
Is Leader out?

869
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:01,920
That’s rare.

870
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:03,670
Alight,

871
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:05,150
get some rest after the meal.

872
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:06,120
Don’t stay up too late.

873
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:09,230
Yan,

874
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,710
I mean you.

875
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,190
Starting from tomorrow,

876
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:15,000
no more lie-ins.

877
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,120
You’ve been slack lately.

878
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:19,190
Mr. Ma,

879
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:21,710
(Liquor)
what’s going on outside?

880
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,800
Whatever it is,

881
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,670
it has nothing to do with you, got it?

882
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:27,710
Are you done?

883
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:29,190
Go upstairs to sleep.

884
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:30,600
Go!

885
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:34,080
Go away.

886
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:44,890
When will she grow up?

887
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,950
Have a good night.

888
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,040
Fei.

889
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:49,950
You too.

890
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:50,560
Sure.
