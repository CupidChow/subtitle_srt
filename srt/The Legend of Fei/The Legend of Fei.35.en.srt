=Episode 35=

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,400
Do you remember

18
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,400
the first time we met?

19
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,310
You were the chief of Anping Army.

20
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,440
I was a disciple expelled
by Big Medicine Valley.

21
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,680
Master thought

22
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,360
I was good at poison,

23
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,120
not medicine.

24
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,230
I was too evil

25
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,630
to have Book of Almighty Medicine

26
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,360
and be the head of the Valley.

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,480
I got in a rage and defected.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,590
It’s you who took me in.

29
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,000
Yeah.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,680
Instead of learning to heal the weak,

31
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,830
it’s better

32
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,750
to make yourself stronger.

33
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,080
You want me to get you
the Color of Ocean and Heaven,

34
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,030
as a weapon

35
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,270
to pacify the world.

36
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,550
I believe

37
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,800
you’ll become the ruler of the world.

38
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,110
Things have changed.

39
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,470
I’m no longer the chief of Anping Army.

40
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,960
We haven’t got

41
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,800
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

42
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,750
What happened, Shen?

43
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,880
I underestimated these young people.

44
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,800
Tong Tianyang. Chu Tianyu. Lu Tiankuang.

45
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,830
They were all defeated by some kids

46
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,390
with Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

47
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,470
Tianying.

48
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,360
They don’t even know

49
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,030
what the Color of Ocean and Heaven

50
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,440
is.

51
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,470
Their victory

52
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,550
is nothing but fluke.

53
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,270
Sooner or later,

54
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,470
I will get back

55
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,190
what they have taken from us.

56
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,470
What’s your plan?

57
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,720
Zhou Fei has got Fire Lotus.

58
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,910
Her next target

59
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,720
should be the Flaming Sage

60
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,080
at Cloud Ravine in the south,

61
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,360
to resist the poison
in Xiao Chuan’s system.

62
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,750
I’m going to kill her

63
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,700
and get back the Seal of Cautiousness.

64
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,620
May you come back soon.

65
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,270
Don’t go astray.

66
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,470
(Demons Manor)

67
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,160
I was an orphan in the snow mountain,

68
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,110
living with beasts and
suffering from hunger.

69
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,750
You saved me

70
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,440
and gave me a new life.

71
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,160
I only

72
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,630
trust you.

73
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,720
I have

74
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,670
a task for you.

75
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,750
Badly, I was still late.

76
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,910
Liu Youliang who escorted the map

77
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,910
failed to keep the secret.

78
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,240
I had a deal with Phoenix Master.

79
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,880
He helped me get Fire Lotus.

80
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,030
I must

81
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,360
give him the Seal of Cautiousness.

82
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,350
They are all after
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

83
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,070
What is it exactly?

84
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,880
Master.

85
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,390
Do you know it?

86
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,160
Well...

87
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,070
Anzhi is supposed to tell you.

88
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,440
If you are eager to know,

89
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,270
go ask your father,

90
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,790
Lord Gantang.

91
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,440
My father?

92
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,720
Go to see him

93
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,320
and he’ll tell you everything.

94
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,600
Why don’t you see Anzhi before leaving?

95
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,070
I...

96
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,110
I won’t.

97
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,320
I’m afraid I can’t leave

98
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,480
if I see him.

99
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,070
Lord Gantang.

100
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,950
Thanks.

101
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,040
Is it from Madam Li?

102
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,200
Can you tell by a touch?

103
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,510
I know from this.

104
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,550
Sir. A girl is asking to see you.

105
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,440
She gave me this.

106
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,000
Guards thought it was a prank.

107
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,920
So, they didn’t dare to disturb you.

108
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,670
I’ve checked it.

109
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,000
I think you may have a look.

110
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,790
Who is so bold?

111
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,950
It’s fine.

112
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,510
Let her in.

113
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,320
Yes.

114
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,550
Alright. You’re free to go.

115
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,270
Yes.

116
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,270
Lord Gantang is in the camp ahead.

117
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,880
Please.

118
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,160
He’s inside.

119
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,660
Fei.

120
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,270
Father.

121
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,830
Fei.

122
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,920
You look taller, don’t you?

123
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,760
Father, it’s been a while.

124
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,070
Fei.

125
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,950
I didn’t take you with me when I left.

126
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,000
Do you blame me now?

127
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,670
I know.

128
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,320
My girl is tough.

129
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,160
Tell me.

130
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,670
Where have you been all this time?

131
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,070
Well... A long story.

132
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,760
Let’s talk inside.

133
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,270
Are you all right?

134
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,720
I’m fine.

135
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,550
It’s been windy.

136
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,670
You look thin.

137
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,760
It’s understandable.

138
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,880
In the Fortress,

139
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,000
your mother used to

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,510
go hunting and pick flesh vegetables

141
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,110
for me.

142
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,600
But I got nothing here.

143
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,080
You still wear this old gown she made?

144
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,230
It’s not old.

145
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,550
The clothes she made are
the best to keep warm.

146
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,150
Is this

147
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,960
the highly praised Anping Army?

148
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:04,350
In troubled times, there must be someone
standing out.

149
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,760
Suddenly, I can understand him,

150
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,400
and my mother,

151
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,640
and Xie Yun.

152
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,200
Come. I have a gift for you.

153
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,230
Father.

154
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,880
Is it a welcome gift?

155
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,200
You’re humorous.

156
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,880
Take a look.

157
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,780
(Unbreakable)

158
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,030
It’s named Unbreakable.

159
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Is it some poison?

160
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,280
Top poisons are colorless and tasteless.

161
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,320
I’m telling you out of kindness.

162
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,150
Try it.

163
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,280
No.

164
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,670
I won’t.

165
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,030
Why don’t you try it?

166
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,320
If I try,

167
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,840
who will record

168
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,470
the symptoms and reactions?

169
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,400
Look. I’ve made the antidote for you.

170
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,320
What do you fear of?

171
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,470
Your last poison got me in bed for days.

172
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,080
I won’t do it again.

173
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,960
You asked me to study Bone-chilling.

174
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,960
Is it Bone-chilling?

175
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,880
Bone-chilling is extremely complicated
to prepare.

176
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,400
The formula is long gone.

177
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,230
The toxicity of this poison

178
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,960
is not even one tenth of Bone-chilling.

179
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,350
Drink it and have the antidote at once.

180
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,200
Nothing will happen.

181
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,520
Why don’t you get Li Yan to try it?

182
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,200
Are you talking about me?

183
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,030
-No, nothing.
-No, nothing.

184
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,320
We... We have new clothes for you.

185
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,200
You said you’d buy new clothes.

186
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,230
So, he wants you to try them.

187
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,880
That doesn’t matter.

188
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,030
Look, a letter from Fei.

189
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,550
She is safe and sound.

190
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,080
Isn’t Xie Yun dead?

191
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,350
Fei also said

192
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,550
Xie’s master had got the formula.

193
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,200
Fei is

194
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,590
looking for the ingredients.

195
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,840
Let me see.

196
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,440
Fire Lotus. Flaming Sage.

197
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,840
Flaming Sage?

198
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,200
The name rings a bell.

199
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,230
It only grows in Cloud Ravine.

200
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,880
Sir, have you ever heard of it?

201
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,030
You bonehead.

202
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,280
Why did they get you as the leader?

203
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,110
What else did she say?

204
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,590
Would she go to Cloud Ravine?

205
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,760
Father, don’t worry about me.

206
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,150
Ordinary martial artists

207
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,520
are no match to me.

208
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,520
I’ve also fought Demons more than once.

209
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,760
It’s so kind of you, Father.

210
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,200
You know I need a blade.

211
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,640
Actually,

212
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,790
I’ve been looking for a good blade
for you.

213
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,110
The world has been in chaos.

214
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,840
Good blades are

215
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,350
getting less.

216
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,230
I also had men find ancient blades,

217
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,400
yet few of them fit you.

218
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,110
Some of the ancient blades

219
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,880
are mediocre in quality.

220
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,150
Some of them are

221
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,550
subject to ominous tales.

222
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,440
Finally, I got this blade.

223
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,790
It’s perfect for you.

224
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,840
Lyu Run,

225
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,760
the maker of the blade, is not famous.

226
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,790
This is

227
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,520
the one and only blade he forged.

228
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,000
His name rings a bell.

229
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:02,520
He’s said to be
the last apprentice of Guigu,

230
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,790
adept at art of war, medicine
and martial arts,

231
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,640
a household name in the former dynasty.

232
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,670
Lyu Run passed his learning

233
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,550
to three apprentices.

234
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,760
One of them set up Big Medicine Valley.

235
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,230
Another set up Qi School.

236
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,400
The youngest learned the art of war

237
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,150
and became an officer.

238
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,550
Huang Shenbian is his disciple.

239
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,080
Huang Shenbian?

240
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,230
I think of it.

241
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,670
Lyu Run, the Book of Almighty Medicine

242
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,110
of the Big Medicine Valley.

243
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,910
Exactly, that’s his work.

244
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,550
Is he Huang Shenbian’s grandmaster?

245
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,590
Father, what does he have to do

246
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,440
with the Color of Ocean and Heaven?

247
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,880
You know the secret about it,

248
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,080
right?

249
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:58,520
Fei, how many objects of it

250
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,840
have you seen?

251
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,840
If

252
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,230
the ripple pattern means
the Color of Ocean and Heaven,

253
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,440
I’ve seen

254
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,230
the gold bracelet of the Fortress,

255
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,350
the scabbard of
Yin Pei’s Mountain Sword,

256
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,990
Wu Chuchu’s Longevity Lock,

257
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,350
Old Master Huo’s Seal of Cautiousness.

258
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,440
So, you are one step closer

259
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,320
to open the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

260
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,030
I’m just wondering

261
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,880
what that item is.

262
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,550
Its name has been haunting me.

263
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,030
It got

264
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,550
so many people around me in danger.

265
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
My uncle. Chenfei.

266
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Master Ji.

267
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,250
And Xie Yun.

268
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,250
Fei.

269
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,400
Is Xie Yun the friend you mentioned?

270
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,350
Listen.

271
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,280
Actually,

272
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,670
it’s haunting him,

273
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,580
not you.

274
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,670
How is he?

275
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,400
He’s fine for now.

276
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,090
The chill has got into bones.

277
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,200
His organs are nearly frozen.

278
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,200
He...

279
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,000
Don’t worry.

280
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,640
He wakes up from time to time.

281
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,400
He won’t be disturbed

282
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,880
however loud we speak.

283
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,520
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

284
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,480
What are you laughing at?

285
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,230
After he gets recovered,

286
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,000
will he sneak out

287
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,960
and make troubles again?

288
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,200
He’s young and reckless.

289
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,280
He wouldn’t stay on this isolated island

290
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:39,210
with a bunch of old men,

291
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,470
would he?

292
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,030
Generally, kids will come home

293
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,710
once they run out of money.

294
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,030
But he still traveled around

295
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,280
even penniless.

296
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,670
Born with a silver spoon in his mouth,

297
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:56,470
he has no idea about money.

298
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,530
It’s not a bad thing.

299
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,690
Without suffering,

300
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,640
how can he understand the pain in life?

301
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,070
You have a point.

302
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,640
Sir, would you like some wonton?

303
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,920
Cloth.

304
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,950
Take a seat, please.

305
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,520
I took lots of money with me.

306
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,310
It’s running out again.

307
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,560
So much?

308
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,520
Thank you! Thank you!

309
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,160
What can I buy with these?

310
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,310
A bottle of wine and a portion of meat.

311
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,280
Fine. A bottle of wine and
a portion of meat.

312
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,640
Yes, sir.

313
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,230
I’ve run out of money.

314
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,230
What to do in the future?

315
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,950
Pastries.

316
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,070
Take a look.

317
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,470
Flowers. Have a look.

318
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,640
Flowers!

319
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,110
Well.

320
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,190
What happened to that prostitute?

321
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,350
Did she marry that noble?

322
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,230
Yes,

323
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,880
they married

324
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,190
and lived a happy life ever after.

325
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,830
What the heck is that?

326
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,070
How can they get married?

327
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,160
Ridiculous.

328
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:15,470
Give me some money, please.

329
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,160
Give me some money, please.

330
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,310
You listened to my story

331
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,000
and didn’t pay?

332
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,070
Ridiculous.

333
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,450
Sir.

334
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,950
Your story is too boring.

335
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,920
Can you tell stories?

336
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,000
Listen.

337
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,110
The noble in your story

338
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,310
is a playboy.

339
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,950
How would he change himself

340
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,710
for a prostitute?

341
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,190
That prostitute

342
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,110
could finally marry to a noble,

343
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,430
and thought she’d live better.

344
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,760
Unexpectedly,

345
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,760
that noble didn’t cherish her.

346
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,830
She was dumped,

347
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,800
and died of depression.

348
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,230
But... Isn’t the story

349
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,590
too pathetic?

350
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,040
At this time,

351
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,800
people prefer sad stories,

352
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,160
don’t they?

353
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,430
I haven’t had food for days.

354
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,830
Give me some money, please.

355
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,160
I have no money either.

356
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,070
I’ve been starving for days, too.

357
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,900
(Zuixian Tavern)

358
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,590
You did me a great favor today.

359
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,640
People loved your story

360
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,920
and I made a fortune.

361
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,430
I’ve never

362
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,760
made so much before.

363
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,230
If you want to make money,

364
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:45,680
write lyrics or songs.

365
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,350
Can I make money by lyrics and songs?

366
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,160
Yes.

367
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,470
There is a mysterious troupe,

368
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,000
Yuyi Troupe.

369
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,190
Give me some money, please.

370
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,640
-Yuyi Troupe?
-If you have good lyrics and songs,

371
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,950
they’ll have

372
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:07,000
beautiful girls to buy from you.

373
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,520
They’ll pay handsomely.

374
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,560
Thanks. I’ll have a try.

375
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,160
Good.

376
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,600
(Zuixian Tavern)
What a good day!

377
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,190
Lyrics and songs can get me money?

378
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,040
Good.

379
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,190
Thank you, sir! Thank you.

380
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,620
(Zuixian Tavern)

381
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:39,160
Sir, your dishes. Please enjoy.

382
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,920
Get up.

383
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,880
You dare to get in my way.

384
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,400
What a bad luck.

385
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,640
I was taking a nap.

386
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,880
I didn’t mean it.

387
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,470
Sir, it’s no big deal. Calm down.

388
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,350
Don’t beat him.

389
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,190
Hey, man.

390
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,110
Stay out of it.

391
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,190
He is a poor beggar.

392
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,160
You didn’t help him,

393
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,430
and even beat him.

394
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:10,190
He got me bad luck.

395
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,280
Are you defending him?

396
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,190
Are you alone?

397
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,920
Yes, I am defending him.

398
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,470
Guys, come here!

399
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,800
Get him! Beat him up!

400
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,310
Brother, I’m being bullied!

401
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,400
Get him!

402
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,760
-Stop there!
-Stop there!

403
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,430
Get him! Beat his teeth out!

404
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,760
-Move!
-Get way!

405
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,760
Smells so good.

406
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,400
What...? What is it?

407
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,830
It’s chicken.

408
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,880
Sir, try some first.

409
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,760
Alright.

410
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,640
Here. Come on.

411
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,000
It’s tasty.

412
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,350
-Here.
-Thanks.

413
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,470
Hey, man. Take it.

414
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,800
Good.

415
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,400
How is it, sir?

416
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,310
It’s good.

417
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,040
So delicious.

418
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:19,220
(Departure Sorrow Pavilion, Qian Suiyou)

419
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,830
Soldiers.

420
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,110
Sir.

421
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,560
We didn’t do anything.

422
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,590
Don’t be afraid.

423
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,520
We are looking for someone,

424
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,280
not you.

425
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,310
Go and search.

426
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,350
-Aye.
-Aye.

427
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,520
Anzhi wakes up.

428
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,590
Be careful.

429
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,470
Slowly.

430
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,430
Anzhi. You are too weak.

431
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,680
Don’t move around.

432
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,950
I dreamed that

433
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,760
Fei was here.

434
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,470
Yeah.

435
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,400
She did come here.

436
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,710
She got you the medicine

437
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,400
and left with the Seal of Cautiousness.

438
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,590
She knew nothing

439
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,190
about the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

440
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:59,160
Why did she take the Seal?

441
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,520
Anzhi.

442
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,310
Many things happened

443
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,400
while you were unconscious.

444
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,040
You know what?

445
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,830
Liu Youliang reappeared.

446
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,470
The Color of Ocean and Heaven
could be reopened.

447
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:15,760
The world will be in chaos again.

448
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,230
That’s not my concern for now.

449
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,400
Master.

450
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,800
Can I keep awake

451
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,640
until Fei comes back?

452
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,800
In the rebellion

453
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,110
twenty-five years ago,

454
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:45,560
to preserve the strength of our dynasty,

455
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,400
Huang Shenbian got most treasures

456
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,040
out of the palace

457
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,800
with several guardians.

458
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,590
They were hid near Big Medicine Valley.

459
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,350
Those treasures

460
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,640
are the so-called
Color of Ocean and Heaven.

461
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,400
How did you know it, Father?

462
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,800
Wang Lin,

463
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,230
Huang Shenbian’s lieutenant,

464
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,470
was in charge of Anping Army.

465
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,430
At the mutiny,

466
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,400
he was out for a mission
and didn’t participate in it.

467
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,710
So, he didn’t know about it.

468
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,430
Then Huang Shenbian died.

469
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,830
The secret

470
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,400
was somehow leaked out.

471
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,680
That’s why Yin Wenlan got killed,

472
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,430
Big Medicine Valley destroyed.

473
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:34,190
Wang Lin tried to find the treasures
all his life

474
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,310
to restore the dynasty,

475
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,710
but he had no clue

476
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,160
about the location.

477
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,710
As the lieutenant,

478
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:46,160
even Wang Lin didn’t know all the clues.

479
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,310
How could Demons

480
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,190
know it more than him?

481
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,880
Because Shen Tianshu

482
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,040
ever served in Anping Army.

483
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,760
Now,

484
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,400
people all know it.

485
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,000
The Color of Ocean and Heaven

486
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,710
is no longer a secret.

487
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,680
Father.

488
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,560
What is it exactly?

489
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,350
Could it really change the world

490
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,880
as they say?

491
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,680
Do you really believe there is something

492
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,830
that can bring back the dead?

493
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,430
I don’t know

494
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,160
what it is.

495
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,710
And I think

496
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:42,400
no one knows.

497
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,560
But I believe

498
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,190
nothing can change the fate.

499
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,230
Or else,

500
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,830
how could our dynasty fall apart

501
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,920
in an instant?

502
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:58,560
It’s the greed that drives people

503
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,160
to look for it.

504
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,520
I get to understand

505
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,470
why Xie Yun refused to talk about it.

506
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,520
Some things

507
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,430
are destined.

508
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:19,560
He is unable to avoid them.

509
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,520
Alright. Father.

510
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,680
I’ve known about it.

511
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,710
I will save Xie Yun.

512
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,560
After he wakes up,

513
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,110
I will help him

514
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,950
whatever he wants to do.

515
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,640
Slowly.

516
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,920
What are you doing?

517
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,590
I want to draw.

518
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,680
Draw what?

519
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,190
I’ll draw for Fei

520
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:08,000
and show it to her when she’s back.

521
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,710
We may leave. Leave.

522
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,350
Let’s go.

523
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,640
Let’s go.

524
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,560
Let’s go.

525
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,520
Greetings, Your Highness.

526
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,000
I’m here to see Lord Gantang.

527
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,280
He’s in the camp. Come with me, please.

528
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,400
You may wait here.

529
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,430
-Aye.
-Aye.

530
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,160
Please.

531
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,230
Right ahead.

532
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,350
Report.

533
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,590
Lord, the Third Prince comes.

534
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,520
Sure. Invite him in.

535
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,430
Please.

536
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,280
Be sure to keep in mind

537
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,830
what I’ve told you.

538
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,110
Greetings, Lord Gantang.

539
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,830
My respects to you, Your Highness.

540
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,950
Let me introduce.

541
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,470
My daughter, Fei.

542
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:30,040
Fei, this is the Third Prince.

543
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,040
Your Highness.

544
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:32,950
Good to see you.

545
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,880
Don’t be so polite to me, Miss Zhou.

546
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:39,110
Do you know each other?

547
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,400
Fei, why didn’t you tell me?

548
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,470
More than that.

549
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,920
She saved my life before.

550
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,190
Hadn’t she helped me,

551
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,070
I’d have been taken away

552
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,230
by Demons.

553
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,590
My pleasure.

554
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,280
Don’t mention it.

555
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,680
Fei.

556
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,470
As I told you,

557
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,310
at the Demon-Extermination Assembly
in Huo’s Manor,

558
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,710
he encountered Chu Tianyu.

559
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,000
Xie Yun and I protected him

560
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,560
and let him...
Let His Highness leave first.

561
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,430
I see.

562
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,430
By the way, I...

563
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:20,110
Father, you must have business
to talk about.

564
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,760
I’ll take my leave.

565
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:25,190
Alright. Go back then.

566
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,400
Take good care of yourself.

567
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,160
Take care.

568
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:32,880
Go.

569
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,040
Good day, Miss Zhou.

570
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,470
Welcome,

571
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:49,560
Your Highness.

572
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,590
What brings you here?

573
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,830
I have good news for you, Lord.

574
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,040
On my way here,

575
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,800
I’ve heard the Anping Army

576
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,800
is well disciplined

577
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,070
under your command.

578
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,680
Your Highness.

579
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,520
Are you here offering amnesty

580
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,710
by the order of His Majesty?

581
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,870
No, you mistake it.

582
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,710
I’m here

583
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,080
for personal affairs.

584
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,280
Personal affairs?

585
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,760
We don’t know much about each other.

586
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,520
What is it about?

587
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,360
I heard you did a great job

588
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,760
in settling the refugees.

589
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,670
I’d like to learn from you.

590
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,470
Please.

591
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,600
Your Highness.

592
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,390
Do you have interest in governance now?

593
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:35,390
Get to the point, please.

594
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:37,910
Actually, I’m here

595
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,080
for the affair between Zhou Fei and me.

596
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,670
Your Highness.

597
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,840
I apologize

598
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,600
if she offended you.

599
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,000
No. In the Demon-Extermination Assembly,

600
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,280
Zhou Fei saved my life.

601
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,230
I was deeply impressed by her,

602
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,870
and miss her so much.

603
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,710
That’s why I come to you.

604
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,520
I admire her.

605
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,520
Please allow me to marry her.

606
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:09,800
Your Highness.

607
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,000
For the sake of your safety,

608
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,320
you’d better not

609
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,910
mess with her.

610
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,260
(Qiaoyun House)

611
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,600
Madam.

612
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,280
No man knows to

613
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,630
cherish their love

614
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,010
until they lose them.

615
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,080
Sorry, Madam. I should be blamed.

616
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,910
What’s the use of blaming you?

617
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,870
Poor girl.

618
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,600
She doesn’t practice martial arts.

619
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,390
How could she bear the hit?

620
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,840
You must have a way, right?

621
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,230
I don’t.

622
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,600
Madam.

623
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,670
What are you doing? On your feet.

624
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,150
Rise.

625
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,120
Fine.

626
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,670
Since you’re sincere,

627
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,390
I’ll tell you the truth.

628
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:33,320
The Muyun Gauze she wears

629
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,630
absorbed most of the energy

630
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,710
from the hit.

631
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,120
The Muyun Gauze is broken,

632
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,520
but she’ll recover soon
after taking the medicine.

633
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,560
Young Master, thank you

634
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,630
for helping us.

635
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,430
I’m flattered.

636
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,470
I happened to be there.

637
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:59,080
It’s my pleasure.

638
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,430
If you’ll wait for Zhou Fei

639
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,600
in Lingling Inn,

640
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,230
please tell her

641
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,800
Chuchu and I are with Madam Nichang.

642
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,000
She is fine.

643
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:09,430
I’m going back now. No worries.

644
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,280
I’ll let her know.

645
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,390
Good day.

646
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,080
Is it the Cloud Ravine?

647
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,630
So hot here.

648
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,430
It is indeed a small ravine.

649
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,840
Due to the hot and humid weather,

650
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,280
exotic herbs grow abound here.

651
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,630
Some herbalists came

652
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,430
and set up the sect,

653
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,910
namely the Small Medicine Valley.

654
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,470
Who are you?

655
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,910
I wondered who it was.

656
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:40,430
So, the Chief is finally coming back.

657
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:42,390
Greetings, Chief.

658
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:45,000
Don’t! I didn’t mean to be back.

659
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
My friend needs some medicine here.

660
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,320
I won’t stay long.

661
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,600
The location is a top secret.

662
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,000
It’s the rule of the sect

663
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,630
that no outsiders are allowed here.

664
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,080
Even the Chief can’t break it.

665
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,520
Yes. But they are my friends.

666
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,630
I guarantee

667
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,670
nothing will happen.

668
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,800
Blindfold yourselves and come with me.

669
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,840
My aunt never blindfolds guests

670
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,190
who visit the Fortress.

671
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:11,000
There are many rules here.

672
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,360
Just do it.

673
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,710
I understand.

674
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,760
In the Small Medicine Valley,

675
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,950
exotic herbs and medicines are all over.

676
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,520
If the evil know

677
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,430
the location here,

678
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,670
it could be in trouble
like Big Medicine Valley.

679
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,150
I don’t think it’s bad.

680
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,710
Alright.

681
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:10,900
(Cloud Ravine)

682
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,870
Who are they?

683
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,040
Who are they?

684
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,560
Go by yourself.

685
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,230
Here we are. Snake Keeper.

686
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,710
Take if off.

687
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,040
Elder.

688
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,230
Chief.

689
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,390
You’re back.

690
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,280
Elder. How was the Valley

691
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,670
during my leave?

692
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,190
Good. Everything is good.

693
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,670
If you don’t take outsiders here,

694
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,840
it would be better.

695
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:21,710
I want some medicine for my friend.

696
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,840
We won’t stay long.

697
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,280
I can’t understand

698
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:31,950
why your master

699
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,470
had you be the chief.

700
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:35,910
One of my friends got poisoned.

701
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,190
His life is on the line.

702
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,520
We need Flaming Sage

703
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,470
to make the antidote.

704
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:42,390
You...

705
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,150
That’s a poisonous herb of great heat,

706
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,120
growing in the wood full of toxic gas.

707
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,560
Whoever goes there will die.

708
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,630
Tell me.

709
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,910
Who will be the one to die?

710
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,120
I will go.

711
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,280
You’re the Chief.

712
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,280
It’s a forbidden place, don’t you know?

713
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,800
You are breaking the rule.

714
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,800
Your life is not my concern.

715
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,470
But what would happen

716
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:12,390
if the Valley lost the Chief?

717
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:15,600
You... You pissed me off.

718
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,320
How rude. He is hitting him!

719
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,950
I won’t be the Chief.

720
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,600
Take the token.

721
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,560
Get someone else to be the Chief.

722
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,840
I quit now.

723
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,520
My life has nothing to do
with the Valley.

724
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,300
Can I go to get the herb now?

725
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,080
As the Chief, you can’t quit at will,

726
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,600
can you?

727
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,710
You’ve failed your master.

728
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,520
-Soldiers. Seize them.
-Aye.

729
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:00,950
Yes.

730
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,630
Don’t you dare!

731
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,470
Hey, old man.

732
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,910
Let him finish his words, will you?

733
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:05,560
Yes.

734
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,520
Knock it off!

735
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,360
It’s a misunderstanding.

736
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,120
You bring outsiders here

737
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,040
and threaten me with a blade.

738
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:14,760
-Yang Jin.
-Do it!

739
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,550
-You do it!
-Which side are you on?

740
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,320
He doesn’t listen.

741
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,520
This is about the sect.

742
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,950
It’s caused by me.

743
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,040
Let them go.

744
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,600
I’ll take the punishment.

745
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,840
Fine. Since you say so.

746
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,360
-Guards.
-Yes.

747
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,000
Seize them.

748
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,280
-Run!
-Yes!

749
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,230
Why are you doing this?

750
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:32,910
Get them!

751
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:35,520
-It’s a misunderstanding! Elder!
-Get them!

752
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,470
-Hurry!
-They are my friends! Not bad people!

753
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:39,760
-Hurry.
-Stop there!

754
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:43,950
Stop!

755
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,280
Stop there!

756
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,040
Stop!

757
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,430
You two, go that way!

758
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:06,390
-Aye!
-Aye!

759
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:07,320
Go.

760
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,870
We got situation here!

761
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:13,040
-Got it.
-This way.

762
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:14,710
Go!

763
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,600
Well.

764
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,560
We came here blindfolded,

765
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,230
and don’t know where we are.

766
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:35,600
Where should we go?

767
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,470
Anywhere,

768
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:38,430
as long as there is no people.

769
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:40,910
Go. Go. Go.

770
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,000
Hurry up. Shut it.

771
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Wait!

772
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,800
I won’t run.

773
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,360
What are you doing here?

774
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,120
It’s the Forbidden Forest ahead.

775
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,320
One step forward and you’ll die.

776
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,600
Who are they?

777
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:07,040
We are...

778
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,560
I’ll release Condensed Dew

779
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,870
to stall for time.

780
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,150
Alright.

781
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,760
Sorry.

782
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,280
We are friends.

783
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,630
-Friends?
-Friends?

784
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:23,800
Yes. Yes.

785
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,120
Is your chief Yang Jin?

786
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:29,230
He is big and tall.

787
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,710
His blade is so long.

788
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:36,040
Are you his friends?

789
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,390
Yes. We know him well.

790
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:40,390
We’re sworn brothers,

791
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,800
aren’t we?

792
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:46,470
Yes. Yes.

793
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:50,040
He always makes troubles

794
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,670
in the Valley.

795
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:54,080
The Elder doesn’t allow him to be here.

796
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,870
You are his friends.

797
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:57,670
Birds of a feather.

798
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:58,760
Seize them!

799
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,320
-Run!
-Run!

800
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,000
Wait! Wait!

801
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,710
Let them take this.

802
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:12,800
One pill each.

803
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,190
They’ll just sleep for half a day.

804
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:22,000
They won’t die.

805
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,190
Half a day?

806
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,280
Is it enough to find the herb

807
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,430
in such a huge mountain?

808
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:31,670
A herb?

809
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,470
That’s Flaming Sage,

810
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:35,080
the top poison in the world.

811
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,760
It must be somewhere extraordinary.

812
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,560
Time is not the problem.

813
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,040
What are you waiting for? Move.

814
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,120
But... Wait... Wait a second.
