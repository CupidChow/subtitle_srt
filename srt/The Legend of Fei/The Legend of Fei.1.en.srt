One day,

18
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,520
you’ll cross the peaceful Ximo River

19
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,510
and leave the embrace of mountains.

20
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,010

00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,460
countless inaccessible
mountains collapse

00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,890

You’ll walk on the tip of your sword,

32
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
(we defend the common people.)
People suffered.

33
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,100

Li Zheng, the South Blade,

36
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,460
(the world will be ours.)
built a fortress

37
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,960
(United by one promise...)
in Hunan.

38
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,010
It consists of 48 martial art sects.

39
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,500
After years in peace,

40
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,720
Fortress of the Forty-Eight now teems

41
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,210
with talents and prosperity.

42
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,640
Ximo River is the only unguarded pass

43
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,250
within the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight.

On the southeast tip,

45

cliffs rise up and are separated

46
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,890
by the broad Ximo River in between,

47
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,440

(Fisherman, Guardian of Ximo River)

No one has ever survived

51
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,230
Anyone who dares to invade the fortress

52
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,620
will have no return.

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,260
(In Fortress of the Forty-Eight)

54
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,240
This is Li Sheng,

55
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,530
the leader’s nephew.

56
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,430
He learns his martial arts

57
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,150
from the leader.

58
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,000
Isn’t he great?

59
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,560
Yes, excellent!

60
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,350
But it’s said among our peers,

61
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,240
a lady called Zhou Fei is the best.

62
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,030
Which of them is better?

63
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,520
Hush.

64
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,940
Bravo!

65

(Li Sheng, Fortress of the Forty-Eight)

66
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:42,730
Excuse me.

67
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,420
Fei, you’re early today.

68
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:46,980
Zhou Fei.

69
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,120
A fight?

70
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,000
Don’t you have the gut?

71
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,040
Sheng, forget it.

72
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,380
(Medicated liquor)

73
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,980
(Zhou Fei, Fortress of the Forty-Eight)

74
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,800
(Zhou Fei, Fortress of the Forty-Eight)
You ask for it.

75
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,470
It seems Zhou Fei is better with blade.

76
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,680
Who do you think is gonna win?

77
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,120
Yeah.

78
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,180

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,590

00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:55,510
Bravo!

82
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,440
It’s a tie.

83
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,330
Let’s call it a day.

(Zhang Chenfei, Senior Disciple)

85
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,280
It doesn’t count. One more.

86
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,280
Did you tear down the master’s stairs?

87
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,450
You framed me for it.

88
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,920
Don’t be so...

89
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,680
You win.

90
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:29,690
I’m done.

91
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,840
(Fisherman, Guardian of Ximo River)
Insolent boy, you’re dead!

93

(Cherish the Memory of the Ancestors)
Ma’am.

100
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,070
Summon Chief Kou

101
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,200
and reinforce the defense.

102
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:23,780
(Ma Jili, Steward)

103
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,620
Yes, Ma’am.

Alarm from Ximo River.

105
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,270
Disciples, on me.

106
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,920
-Yes!
-Chenfei.

107
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,370
Ximo River isn’t easy to break through.

108
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,880
Could it be a distraction?

109
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,690
Take a squad and reinforce

110
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,390
the front gate.

111
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,960
The rest of you, come with me.

112
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,770
Yes!

113
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:46,900
Ximo River.

114
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:48,400
Well,

115
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,860
I need to go check it out.

116
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,860
(Zhou Yitang, Fortress of the Forty-Eight)

117
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,020
(Zhou Yitang, Fortress of the Forty-Eight)
The wind is rising.

118
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,130
Make way!

119
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,670
What are you doing here?

120
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,210
I’m going to see what happened.

121
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,500
Leave the security to us.

122
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,800
We got invaders.

123
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,180
Zhou Fei, don’t put us out!

124
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,660
(Forbidden Forest)

125
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:25,900
Watch out!

126
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,680
Why are there wires
from Mingfeng Building?

127
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,990
It’s all over the forest.

128
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,820
Don’t make a fuss about it.

129
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,960
Do you know what spinning wire is?

130
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,320
The spinning wire is exclusive

131
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,090
to Mingfeng Building.

132
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,260
It’s said the wire
is extremely thin, light,

133
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,460
but sharper than blade.

134
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,440
A disciple of our fortress

135
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,380
burst into the forest

136
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,360
by accident.

137
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,630
Once his arms and legs touched the wire,

138
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,800
crack!

139
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,400
The invader

140
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,810
has excellent footwork.

141
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,240
He stepped on leaves

142
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,810
and stones in the formation

143
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,440
and crossed the river without activating

144
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,070
any traps.

145
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,850
Astonishing.

146
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:13,590
You’re trapped.

147
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,260
(Forbidden Forest)

148
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,670
I don’t believe it.

149
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,670
Zhou Fei can get in

150
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,350
and I can’t?

151
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,450
Who are you?

152
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,480
Why did you trespass on our land?

153
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,810
I’m Xie,

154
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:04,770
named Meimei,

155
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,220
(Xie Yun)

156
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,500
(Xie Yun)
also known as the Optimistic Man.

157
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:08,730
Xie...

158
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,220
Li Sheng!

159
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,380
The intruder goes to you.

160
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,310
Stop him!

161
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,020
(Kou Dan, An Elder of the Fortress)

162
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,400
Thanks, Chief Kou.

163
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:37,890
I almost got him.

164
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,890
Damn it.

165
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,590
It’s alright.

166
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,880
He escapes to Ximo River.

167
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,240
Guard the forest and he won’t get in.

168
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,740
(Hall of Elders)

169
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,460
(Hall of Elders)
How could you lose the intruder?

170
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,570
Aunt, it’s my fault.

171
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,600
He escaped from my watch.

172
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,260
Actually, I caught up with him.

173
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,500
But he...

174
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,490
How dare you speak of it?

175
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,180
Ma’am, what did I do?

176
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,470
I asked you to apologize to the master.

177
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,850
Well,

178
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,620
you went out.

179
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,700
The master is your tutor.

180
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,200
You offend him now.

181
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,000
When you’re fully fledged,

182
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,260
will you show no respect
to your parents?

183
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,860
Why would I apologize?

184
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,370
I didn’t tear down his stairs.

185
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,300
Don’t talk back.

186
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,490
We’ll deal with this later.

187
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,010
The forest is full of traps.

188
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,370
Even I dare not to step in.

189
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,740
How dare you burst in?

190
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,550
The intruder went in.

191
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,040
I can’t leave him alone.

192
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,240
-He passed the Spinning...
-Silence!

193
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,630
You don’t need to worry about him.

194
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,060
Go back to your study.

195
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,800
There’s an intruder in the fortress.

196
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,760
How could I concentrate?

197
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,960
The Fortress of the Forty-Eight

198
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,160
doesn’t need your protection.

199
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,070
Go back to your room

200
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,670
and review your behavior.

201
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,190
You’re grounded.

202
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,860
Aunt, the stairs were...

203
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,380
Sheng,

204
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:10,980
you do the same.

205
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,410
Go to your room.

206
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,300
Zhou Fei.

207
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:22,900
Zhou Fei, I’m speaking to you.

208
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,810
Are you deaf?

209
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,700
What?

210
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,480
Girls should be meek.

211
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,250
Why waving your blade each day?

212
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,090
You’re born in the fortress.

213
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,640
When you’re married one day, with me,

214
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,060
no one would dare to mistreat you.

215
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,210
Why don’t you say it to the leader?

216
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,540
Ask her to be a meek, sewing girl.

217
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,210
I agree with you on that.

218
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,480
The fortress was headed by my family.

219
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,790
Without a capable leader,
Aunt took over.

220
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,520
These things shouldn’t be your concern.

221
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,850
That’s very nice of you.

222
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,660
They shouldn’t be
your concern, either, loser.

223
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,800
Who is the loser?

224
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,670
Whoever follows me.

225
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,340
(Hall of Elders)

226
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,620
(Hall of Elders)
Parents’ concern for their children

227
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,300
is so unpredictable.

228
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,760
If Fei is half

229
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,260
as obedient as Sheng,

230
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,470
I won’t beat her again.

231
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,130
Fei seems

232
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,260
stubborn,

233
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,750
but she knows what to do.

234
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,170
Don’t worry.

235
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,020
I’m worried about Sheng.

236
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,840
After his dad passed away,

237
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,180
I place high hopes on him

238
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,270
and teach him myself,

239
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,590
hoping to hand the fortress over to him
as soon as possible.

240
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,140
Sheng isn’t gifted with martial art.

241
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,480
But it’s not a problem.

242
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,470
We can train him.

243
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,010
The boy is sentimental and distracted.

244
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,120
I’m afraid, one day on a whim,

245
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,110
he’ll go astray.

246
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,300
Sheng.

247
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,020
(Li Yan, Fortress of the Forty-Eight)

248
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,980
You’re leaving?

249
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:01,690
Exactly.

250
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,750
The fortress teems with talents.

251
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,280
I’m not indispensable.

252
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,940
The intruder is trapped in the forest.

253
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,560
There’s nothing to worry about.

254
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,910
Aunt won’t let you go.

255
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,280
I’ll take way of Ximo River.

256
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,190
Sheng, are you insane?

257
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,680
Did you forget a few light-footed

258
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,160
disciples tried to cross Ximo River

259
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,480
and were trussed up by the guardian

260
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,680
and hung along the cliff?

261
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,200
Sheng, you won’t make across.

262
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,820
I’ll have a try.

263
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,040
Aunt!

264
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,570
Let go.

265
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,040
Guard that area.

266
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,160
I’ll take care of here.

267
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,100
They reinforced the defense.

268
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,940
How can I get in?

269
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:24,700
See you around.

270
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,360
What are you doing?

271
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,220
My brother left.

272
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,000
Glad to know. Leave me alone.

273
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,390
Before he left, he said

274
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,260
he’d cross Ximo River.

275
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,090
What?

276
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,520
What are you doing?

277
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:55,740
Stay out of this.

278
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,470
The fortress is invaded.

279
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,500
You’re making it worse.

280
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,340
Alright.

281
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,660
Stay and make yourself a heroine.

282
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,960
I’m leaving.

283
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,720
Do you really want to go?

284
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,480
That’s odd.

285
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,370
I’m treated like an orphan,

286
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,880
yet I don’t want to run away.

287
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,260
Why are you, the future leader,

288
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,430
so eager to leave?

289
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,370
The scold and physical abuse

290
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,710
are out of love from your parents.

291
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,180
But I...

292
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,440
I don’t give a damn

293
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,610
about being the incompetent successor.

294
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:45,660
Beyond the river,

295
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,900
there’s a vast world

296
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,240
with countless martial artists.

297
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,620
I’ll do my best

298
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,530
to make my own achievements.

299
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:58,730
So long.

300
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,170
Li Sheng!

301
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,020
Li Sheng!

302
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,920
Is it an auspicious day?

303
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,530
Two more to seek their doom.

304
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,200
The flow is unusual.

305
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:33,470
Something is wrong.

306
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,350
Li Sheng!

307
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,350
Come back!

308
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:35,960
Li Sheng!

309
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,390
Beyond the river

310
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,900
is my world.

311
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,630
Why are the wires moving?

312
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,980
If I didn’t kick you,

313
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,180
your leg would have been severed

314
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,220
from your body.

315
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,320
Why did you come down?

316
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,110
Leave me alone. Get up there.

317
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,240
It’s too late.

318
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,300
We make across,

319
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,280
or we die.

320
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,880
If it’s head, I’ll save them.

321
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,420
If it’s the other, I’ll watch.

322
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,540
It’s Heaven’s will

323
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,860
that I stay out of it.

324
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,580
(Insightful and Open-minded)

325
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,030
Sir,

326
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,370
the enemy is in the dark

327
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,600
and you’re on the bank.

328
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,460
I’m afraid the Ximo River...

329
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,040
Sit.

330
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,260
Have a seat.

331
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,300
(Insightful and Open-minded)

332
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,320
Empty city stratagem.

333
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,490
If I stood guard at the pavilion,

334
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,710
would the boy come out?

335
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,540
The river is defenseless,

336
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,270
but the formation is fully on.

337
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:52,550
Sorry.

338
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,270
I used to boast as a man

339
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,560
and disdain to hang out with you girls.

340
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,980
But now,

341
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,240
you’ll die because of me.

342
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,360
Get over yourself.

343
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:06,940
I won’t die

344
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,690
because of you.

345
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,170
I came on my will.

346
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,410
So it’s suicide.

347
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,120
The intruder must be a top martial man

348
00:23:58,450 --> 00:23:59,960
to pass the formation.

349
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:03,480
Leave me alone.

350
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:06,810
Go back and tell my mother.

351
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,920
If she meets him,

352
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,050
kill him.

353
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,160
It’s easy to kill me.

354
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,570
But you have to stay alive.

355
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,610
It’s you.

356
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,720
How is his footwork possible?

357
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,400
Are you human or ghost?

358
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,160
I weigh the options.

359
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,170
Human is a better choice than ghost.

360
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,540
He’s the intruder I met in the forest.

361
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,610
Pardon me.

362
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,620
Good to see you again.

363
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,250
This is a core of the formation.

364
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,200
Get out now!

365
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,420
Which way?

366
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,320
Go southwest.

367
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,610
Go southwest.

368
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:21,480
Hey!

369
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:32,850
Why did you listen to the intruder?

370
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,450
An intruder who passed the formation.

371
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,720
Weed Spirit.

372
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,260
The formation is moving again.

373
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,200
Go northwest.

374
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,480
What? Care to elaborate?

375
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,200
Bastard, don’t touch my cousin.

376
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,780
I’ve never seen the formation fully on.

377
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,120
Sophisticated,

378
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,450
but it moves in pattern.

379
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,810
I guess the fish is in my net.

380
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,640
Alright. Time to draw it in.

381
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,270
Sir, sir.

382
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,340
(Insightful and Open-minded)

383
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,570
Ten years ago after Jinfeng was killed,

384
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,310
I asked you this.

385
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,550
What is it that the Lis are protecting

386
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,420
with our lives?

387
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,460
(Insightful and Open-minded)

388
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,320
(Insightful and Open-minded)
Aunt! Aunt!

389
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,050
-Aunt!
-Yan, what’s going on?

390
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,340
It’s my brother, Li Sheng.

391
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,390
He’s gonna cross Ximo River.

392
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,470
Fei goes after him.

393
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,010
What?

394
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:50,610
Aunt!

395
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,750
It’s said Fisherman

396
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,220
is a 1,000-year-old catfish.

397
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,120
If he catches them,

398
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,750
will he eat them up?

399
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:01,810
Mister,

400
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,440
who are you?

401
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,100
You don’t know me, do you?

402
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,760
I’m the old catfish.

403
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,670
Ah?

404
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,650
Shut your mouth.

405
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,640
Go and help.

406
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,200
Like the waves in the river,

407
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,660
the young surpass the old.

408
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,740
What you did

409
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,070
is such an eye opener.

410
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,200
I’m pretty old.

411
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,270
But I’ve never met a man
who seeks his own doom.

412
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,970
Are you tired of life?

413
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,950
You passed my Spinning Wire Formation?

414
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,300
Forgive my impertinence.

415
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,280
I’m new in town and find no entrance.

416
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,260
This is the only way,

417
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,820
so I have to try.

418
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,020
I never expected the guardian

419
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:27,980
would be an elder
from Mingfeng Building.

420
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:29,930
I’m flattered.

421
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:31,850
Boy,

422
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,660
I can see

423
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,420
you have talents,

424
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,040
and keen eyes,

425
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,340
and a good look.

426
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,710
But it’s a pity

427
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,880
you’re not in luck.

428
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,560
Bless you.

429
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,770
If we didn’t have a visitor,

430
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,930
I’d throw you two in the river

431
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,470
to sober up.

432
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,180
Is this

433
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,360
your hospitality?

434
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,930
What’s your name, sir?

435
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,750
My last name is Xie,

436
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,200
and first name, Yun.

437
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,010
You must be a master of Qianzhong Sect.

438
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:47,910
I’m just passing by.

439
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:48,780
I didn’t help much.

440
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,140
Thanks to this lady’s quick hand.

441
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,440
There is nothing but mountains here.

442
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:58,910
Not many views.

443
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,150
I presume you didn’t come

444
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,600
for the view at midnight, did you?

445
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,520
Mother,

446
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,590
he could have stayed hidden.

447
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,280
Seeing that we

448
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,740
triggered the formation off,

449
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,440
he risked his life saving ours.

450
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,420
Shut up!

451
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,790
We’re rough, uncivilized people.

452
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,880
The disciples are mostly rude and dumb.

453
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,110
Excuse us.

454
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,100
We’re grateful for your help.

455
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,790
But I wonder what it is

456
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,730
you’re looking for

457
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,230
in the fortress at midnight?

458
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:36,800
To be honest,

459
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,010
I come to visit someone at request.

460
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,130
But your defense is so strong

461
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,010
that I have no options

462
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,800
but to do a thing so offensive.

463
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,260
Please forgive me.

464
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,880
Who are you visiting?

465
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,090
May I ask

466
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,730
if Lord Gantang is in your fortress?

467
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:15,560
Who told you

468
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,930
this man is here?

469
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:21,990
The man who made the request.

470
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,090
What if he lied?

471
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:29,240
What he asked is of great significance.

472
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,360
If he intended to make fun of me,

473
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,680
it wouldn’t be on this.

474
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:37,820
What else did he say?

475
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:42,500
He said he had a little friction

476
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,400
with the leader of the fortress, Mr. Li,

477
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,340
years ago.

478
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,380
It’s not a big deal.

479
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,410
The leader must be busy.

480
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:54,740
We’d better not get him bothered

481
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,840
in this trivial matter.

482
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,560
-You’re a dead man.
-You’re a dead man.

483
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,800
Did Wang Lin ask you to come?

484
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:14,490
Exactly.

485
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,330
I didn’t know

486
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:20,090
you’re the famous Leader Li.

487
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,270
It’s a great honor

488
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,750
to meet you today.

489
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,320
What have you done

490
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,020
that got yourself this doomed job?

491
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,060
I would kill you

492
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,170
with my palm due to his name, Wang Lin.

493
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,220
I’m nobody

494
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,460
but an errand man.

495
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,690
How could I have anything to do
with General Wang Lin?

496
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,270
Please don’t joke.

497
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,200
But you saved my daughter and my nephew.

498
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,200
We’re even now.

499
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,770
Hand over the old bastard’s token.

500
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,560
I’ll have you escorted out safe.

501
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,570
I shouldn’t

502
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,330
disobey your order,

503
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,170
but

504
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,600
why do you want Anping Token?

505
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,880
You’re so candid.

506
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,420
Not even an excuse.

507
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,570
But General Wang Lin

508
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,340
gave this to me on his death bed.

509
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,230
I swore to Heaven

510
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,770
that I’d guard it with my life.

511
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,650
Wang Lin is dead?

512
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,340
Lord Gantang.

513
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,300
Sheng.

514
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,620
Sheng.

515
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,080
-Sheng, what’s wrong?
-It hurts.

516
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,310
Where are you hurt?

Chest.

double the guards on Repenting Hall.

520
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,090
Keep every living thing out.

521
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,340
Yes, Ma’am.

522
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,700
Insolent girl!

523
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,320
Kneel down!

(Loyalty Filial Piety)

525
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,180
Ma’am.

526
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:35,790
Please stop.

527
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:36,820
Don’t speak for her.

528
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:38,420
But...

529
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,400
The elders love you so much.

530
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:50,840
How could you do such a thing?

531
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:53,830
I’m not wrong.

532
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,730
Stubborn girl.

533
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,180
You let him go.

534
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,930
It’s treason, you know?

535
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,450
All I know is

536
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,180
he saved Li Sheng and me on Ximo River.

537
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,330
You told me when I was little

538
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:18,430
that my grandpa was a hero.

539
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:19,820
So am I.

540
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,010
Have you forgotten the strife

541
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,380
in the fortress ten years ago?

542
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:27,520
Put me down. Let me go!

543
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:35,880
Let me go!

544
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,540
Come on. Faster.

545
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,020
Chief Tong, here is what you want.

546
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,580
Let me go!
