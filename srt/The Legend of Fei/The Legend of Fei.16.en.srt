17
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,160
Remember,

18
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,230
Water Cutting of the North Blade

19
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,160
is complicated and changeable.

20
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,800
But it has its own rules.

21
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,520
It’s OK. I’ll stall them first.

22
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,550
You underestimate them.

23
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,390
People from Dragon Sect

24
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,550
all have good ears.

25
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,720
It’s no different from speaking

26
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,360
in front of them when you
talk so quietly.

27
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,720
I can hear everything you say.

28
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,440
You’re still alive?

29
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,450
We will give you to our master

30
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,000
to see how he will punish you.

31
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,270
Let’s deal with the two of them first.

32
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,630
Wait.

33
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,080
Have you considered it?

34
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,160
Are you really going to fight?

35
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,830
Why bother to consider?

36
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,550
Think carefully.

37
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,240
Don’t force me to use my dreadful move.

38
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,390
Dreadful move?

39
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,830
I’d like to know

40
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,720
what it is.

41
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
Originally,

42
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,550
I was going to

43
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,910
block this cave

44
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,630
so you wouldn’t get yourselves killed.

45
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,960
But looks like

46
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,320
you are still looking for death.

47
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,030
I’ll just pull your tongue out

48
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,600
to see if you dare to say that again!

49
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,440
You just know a formation.

50
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,880
Actually this formation

51
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,440
is easy to be broken.

52
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,800
This formation contains

53
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,670
the method of the five elements.

54
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,910
One of you beats the gong

55
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,440
to trigger the attack from the enemy

56
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,720
and show his weakness,

57
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,520
then the other four will come forward.

58
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,440
The five of you guard each other

59
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,670
and exchange with other groups.

60
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,440
So the changes will be endless.

61
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,470
There are many people who know this.

62
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,080
It’s no big deal!

63
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,550
But few of them

64
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,750
know your weak point, right?

65
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,910
Weak point? How could you know?

66
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,240
It’s “Jin” on the position “Qian”.

67
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,630
If he is in danger,

68
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,320
the other four will also get influenced.

69
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,160
You brat! You told him?

70
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,600
What a cheating jerk!

71
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,350
Why would I tell him that?

72
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,880
I’m not with them.

73
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,830
What’s more,

74
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,070
they even made me can’t move.

75
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,440
Mr. Yin,

76
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,550
it doesn’t matter if you are with us
or not.

77
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,000
But now you have to stand on our side.

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,320
Think about it.

79
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,760
If we die,

80
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,230
you have been with Dragon Master
for long

81
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,920
and you know his temper.

82
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,550
Will he let you go?

83
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,480
You will also die with us!

84
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,600
Even if you know the way to break
Gong Formation,

85
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,920
will you be strong enough to do that?

86
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,510
Alright,

87
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,270
let’s give it a try then.

88
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:50,850
Back off!

89
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,740
Yes.

90
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,240
I have been waiting for you
the whole night.

91
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,510
You’re really bold.

92
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,200
Your swordsmanship looks like
from the South,

93
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,880
which is really silly.

94
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,350
It doesn’t fit
a beautiful girl like you.

95
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,070
I just thought about it.

96
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,480
It’s a pity if you die.

97
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,180
Look.

98
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,960
If you’re willing to follow me,

99
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,990
I can forgive

100
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,900
everything you have done.

101
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,110
Really?

102
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,780
You will have a wealthy life

103
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,680
and servants around you

104
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,100
no matter where you are.

105
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,880
You can have anything you want.

106
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,990
All the jewelries will belong to you.

107
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,340
It’s much better than
how you are living now.

108
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,510
If I kill your people

109
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,390
and break your Gong Formation,

110
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,760
can you also let this go?

111
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,820
Compared with your pretty face,

112
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,540
these are nothing.

113
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,200
Tell me what your name is.

114
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,510
I like irritable girls.

115
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,510
Look at you guys.

116
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,270
You even sent a girl to deal with
Dragon Master.

117
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,790
Don’t you know how despicable he is?

118
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,320
So ignorant!

119
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,040
Water Cutting?

120
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,740
At this time,

121
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,510
that old guy who can’t protect himself

122
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,640
still taught you something.

123
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,270
But, unluckily,

124
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,200
it won’t work on me.

125
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,670
But it’s already enough to deal with

126
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,640
a loser like you.

127
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,030
Wicked girl.

128
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,600
You just tricked me with two moves.

129
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,370
I remember

130
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,160
the first time I fought with you,

131
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,760
you were just a green hand who

132
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,040
only escaped after playing tricks.

133
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,920
It hasn’t been a few hours

134
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,570
and you have already changed a lot.

135
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,760
Who do you think you are?

136
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,380
I changed my mind.

137
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,950
Talents like you

138
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,000
must be killed.

139
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,880
I can’t let you

140
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,200
practice for more years.

141
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,480
You have been talking so much.

142
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,420
Only this line sounded nice.

143
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,200
It won’t cost me

144
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,970
more years to kill you.

145
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,390
How arrogant!

146
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,440
Be careful.
He has a close-fitting armor!

147
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,760
No wonder I can’t hurt him.

148
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,760
I thought he was invulnerable.

149
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,400
If not for his armor,

150
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,030
I would have already

151
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,470
taken his arms off.

152
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,470
What are you doing?

153
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,640
Helping you.

154
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,320
About what?

155
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,350
Block the blade!

156
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,350
Lad.

157
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,080
You have watched enough?

158
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,320
There was a craftsman

159
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,710
who was said to be able to
perform wonders

160
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,650
and make many great weapons.

161
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,760
Other than that,

162
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,190
there was a Muyun Gauze

163
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,030
which is said to be bright and clear

164
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,150
without flaw.

165
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,470
When it’s in the dark,

166
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,640
it will be like flowing moonlight.

167
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,910
And it’s light.

168
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,690
You can be invulnerable wearing it.

169
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,690
As far as I know,

170
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,670
the Muyun Gauze

171
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,030
was made by Yin Wenlan,
the Mountain Sword,

172
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,690
for his wife.

173
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,350
Don’t you feel a little bit tight

174
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,720
when wearing it?

175
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,670
What do you want to say?

176
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,860
I’m just curious that

177
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,320
since you got the Yin’s things,

178
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,000
why are you not the second
Mountain Sword?

179
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,960
What else do you know?

180
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,840
I know everything.

181
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,200
The Color of Ocean and Heaven.

182
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,840
Your silver tongue

183
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,110
should be used to buy time,

184
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,670
not to look for death.

185
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,990
Dragon Master,

186
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,930
we can talk. Don’t be angry.

187
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,910
Which one of
“The Color of Ocean and Heaven”

188
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,400
is your enemy?

189
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,760
You can tell me

190
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,530
and I’ll never say it again.

191
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,150
You brat.

192
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,440
I knew he is reluctant to kill me.

193
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,040
What are you doing?

194
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,320
Miss Wu,

195
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,520
step aside.

196
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,230
Don’t get hurt.

197
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,150
OK.

198
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,550
Aren’t you already destroyed?

199
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,760
You thought the North Blade has been
wiped out

200
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,960
so you

201
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,300
have been at ease, right?

202
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,470
Zheng Luosheng,

203
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,350
you haven’t made any progress
on your martial arts.

204
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,280
I think I have known the reason.

205
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,360
That’s really the North Blade.

206
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,410
You can still stand up again
after being destroyed.

207
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,760
Alright, that’s great.

208
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,550
I have been wanting

209
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,770
to see how great the two blades
and one sword are.

210
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,330
If I haven’t made

211
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,710
any progress,

212
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,170
I’d like to see how much progress

213
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,960
you have made.

214
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,920
I have to ask about one thing first.

215
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,520
The Yins are killed by you.

216
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,320
You’re not wronged about it, right?

217
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,640
What does it have to do with you?

218
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,860
So what if it is or not?

219
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,080
Yin Wenlan

220
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,580
was a great master.

221
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,030
But hundreds of people of his family

222
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,770
died overnight.

223
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,360
That has something to do with me.

224
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,220
Since I have got the answer,

225
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,710
it will be easy.

226
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,970
Ji Yunchen,

227
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,650
let alone that you’re disabled.

228
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,970
Even if you are not,

229
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,790
you may not defeat me.

230
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,320
It doesn’t matter

231
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,720
who is stronger

232
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,200
or who is the winner.

233
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,590
The point is that today

234
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,060
I’m gonna end your life.

235
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,180
I’d like to see

236
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,670
what trouble a disabled North Blade

237
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,550
can make!

238
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,840
Mr. Yin,

239
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,150
all you want to see now

240
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,880
must be the death of Dragon Master.

241
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,550
Mr. Xie, you’re really smart.

242
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,400
It’s hard to say

243
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,960
who will win now.

244
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,520
How about we join hands?

245
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,030
His needle…

246
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,950
Let’s talk about it later.

247
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,720
I won’t tell you.

248
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,960
Can you put it another way?

249
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,090
Unlock his acupoints first.

250
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,280
Don’t worry.

251
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,400
Since I have agreed to ally,

252
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,320
I will keep my words.

253
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,440
I thought

254
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,110
being homicidal should be combative.

255
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,880
But now

256
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,550
I found that being really homicidal

257
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,840
is reserved.

258
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,200
Murderous look won’t be visible,

259
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,580
but it’s actually everywhere.

260
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,930
That’s the real killing blade.

261
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,590
The time left for Mr. Ji
is not too much.

262
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,790
After the Soul-searching Needle works,

263
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,980
it won’t last long.

264
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,150
I made such a big scene

265
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,230
only for you brat.

266
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,990
But now you came yourself.

267
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,670
Pei!

268
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,200
Muyun Gauze really doesn’t fit you.

269
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,320
Wicked girl!

270
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,790
Miss Zhou!

271
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,020
Mr. Ji.

272
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,190
“Possessed by wandering soul

273
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,470
and become a wild ghost”.

274
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,400
Soul-searching Needle

275
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,420
is also known as Reviving Needle.

276
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,670
It’s a mystique from far away.

277
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,160
It can make people find back

278
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,270
the vitality.

279
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,590
It can cover any illness

280
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,760
or injury you have

281
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,710
no matter how serious it is.

282
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,850
But...

283
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,270
The effect can only

284
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,710
last three quarters.

285
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,620
Miss Zhou,

286
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,710
before I die,

287
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,580
I could have a fight with you

288
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,850
and teach you the Water Cutting.

289
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,930
It already made me satisfied.

290
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,560
I don’t care about North or South Blade.

291
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,320
I remember

292
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,050
Mr. Yin once told me…

293
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,110
In the future,

294
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,900
you’ll have many difficulties to face.

295
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,310
I just don’t want

296
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,160
you younger generation

297
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,350
to be destroyed in my hand.

298
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,560
Mr. Ji.

299
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,950
Pei,

300
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,440
I’m sorry.

301
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,360
This is all

302
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,720
I can repay you.

303
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,280
Just go.

304
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,700
Do we really have no way to help him?

305
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,730
“Heaven.”

306
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,760
“I have always been wanting”

307
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,950
“to know you and cherish you.”

308
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,680
“Only when the world comes to an end”

309
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,680
“can I throw away my love for you.”

310
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,680
These scholars

311
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,000
always like to show off literary skills.

312
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,590
Not like me,

313
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,000
who just want to start my own sect

314
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,640
after battling with all the masters.

315
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,530
The first place in the world,

316
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,070
or the good fame for half a life.

317
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,900
Let all these things

318
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,800
go with the wind...

319
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,120
Mr. Yin.

320
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,500
You killed Dragon Master,

321
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,470
and Mr. Ji is also dead.

322
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,250
You have got your revenge.

323
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,190
How about his graciousness to you

324
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,890
for more than ten years?

325
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,780
He has already died.

326
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,120
It’s just what he wanted.

327
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,080
Are you also looking for
the Color of Ocean and Heaven?

328
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,890
It’s none of your business

329
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,730
about what I’m going to do.

330
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,420
This belonged to my family.

331
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,810
But Dragon Master once owned it.

332
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,470
So I won’t need it.

333
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,680
It’ll be yours.

334
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,200
If you don’t like it,

335
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,190
you can just throw it.

336
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:42,710
Mr. Yin!

337
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,610
Chuchu,

338
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,550
just keep it.

339
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,830
It will be a dangerous journey.

340
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,190
And you don’t know any martial art.

341
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,640
It can save your life.

342
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,400
Keep it.

343
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,310
(Grave of Ji Yunchen)

344
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:14,040
(Grave of Ji Yunchen)
A great master like Mr. Ji

345
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,560
(Grave of Ji Yunchen)
could only hide his identity

346
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,470
(Grave of Ji Yunchen)
and be known by no other people.

347
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,230
(Grave of Ji Yunchen)
He shocked the world

348
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,880
when first showed up.

349
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,070
Today I’m lucky to see the Water Cutting
come back to the world.

350
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,190
I’ll always remember it.

351
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,830
Mr. Ji said

352
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,070
the Blade should be used to do things,

353
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,350
not to bring someone fame.

354
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,430
Here, I promise you that

355
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,590
the Water Cutting won’t be lost.

356
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,710
I’ll live up to the blade in my hand.

357
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,350
Back then, he was heroic and free.

358
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,520
(Grave of Ji Yunchen)
But now, he is buried in a small tomb.

359
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,520
Mr. Ji spent all his life

360
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,160
to make up for this mistake.

361
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,430
No matter how,

362
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,230
that’s all written off now.

363
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,110
I really admire

364
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,160
your broad mind.

365
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,880
Hope in the next life

366
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,310
you can achieve all your ambitions

367
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,880
and goals.

368
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,040
Mr. Ji,

369
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,110
we all know

370
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,090
the one you cared the most is Yin Pei.

371
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,830
Hope he can understand

372
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,880
your good intention as soon as possible

373
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,760
and come back to the right way,

374
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,000
living up to the Yins’
chivalrous quality.

375
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,070
Li Sheng,

376
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:39,040
I’m curious about something.

377
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,110
Why don’t you learn the
Snow-breaking Blade

378
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,980
from your grandpa and father,

379
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,470
but use Double Blades?

380
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,040
Many schools are mixed together

381
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,430
in the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

382
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,560
When I was little,

383
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,100
I liked to run around

384
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,230
and liked everything I saw.

385
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,230
Then I learned what I liked.

386
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,950
Back then, I thought Double Blades

387
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,560
might be stronger than a single blade
or sword.

388
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,640
So I learned

389
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,620
the Double Blades from Xiaoxiang Sect.

390
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,350
Later I wanted to learn the South Blade.

391
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,310
But I didn’t

392
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,370
know how to tell my aunt.

393
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,340
That’s why my swordsmanship

394
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,800
is not that great now.

395
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:22,140
It’s rare for you to be introspective.

396
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,550
Actually,

397
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,160
it doesn’t matter whether it’s from

398
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,350
your ancestors or other sects.

399
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,310
You’re Li Zheng’s grandson.

400
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,920
But you don’t have to learn
the South Blade.

401
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,710
If you’re the son of a fisherman,

402
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,830
you don’t have to learn fishing.

403
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:41,350
You should ask yourself

404
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,590
about the truth inside this.

405
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,000
I found that your swordsmanship

406
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,210
is kind of complicated and limited.

407
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,760
That’s because you have too many
distracting thoughts.

408
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,880
Especially while learning Double Blades,

409
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,320
you have to be more concentrated.

410
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,120
Hope you can

411
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,470
gradually learn the swordsmanship

412
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,760
I taught you these days.

413
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:10,400
You did teach me some formations.

414
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,430
When did you teach me swordsmanship?

415
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,800
Everything in the world
is of the same method.

416
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,190
Generally speaking, the formation
is the swordsmanship,

417
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,430
and the swordsmanship is the formation.

418
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,450
It depends on how you understand it.

419
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,380
I’m leaving now.

420
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,970
Take care.

421
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,470
Sir,

422
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,350
let me stay with you for some more days.

423
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,430
Don’t bother.

424
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,800
Then where are you going

425
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,070
next?

426
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,640
I’ll go travel around.

427
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,800
Since Qi School is gone,

428
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,490
I’ll be cosmopolitan.

429
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,640
We have been walking for hours.

430
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:17,520
It’s hard for Chuchu to come

431
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,680
such a long way with us.

432
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,000
Actually,

433
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,800
it’s even harder for you.

434
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,920
After fighting with Dragon Master,

435
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,430
you can still walk such a long way.

436
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,450
You are strong.

437
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,570
Are you praising me or insulting me?

438
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,710
Praising, of course.

439
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,640
Looks like I have to practice more

440
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,350
on how to praise others.

441
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,800
It depends on if Miss Zhou

442
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,680
will give me the chance.

443
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,950
Yeah.

444
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,640
I should give you an attack.

445
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,080
That’s too hard.

446
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,230
Fei…

447
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,880
There is a deserted house.

448
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,280
Let’s go have a rest there.

449
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,950
OK. I will go first

450
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,210
to clean up the deserted inn.

451
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,630
Fei,

452
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,000
sorry.

453
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,490
Why?

454
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,640
You and Xie are martial artists.

455
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,560
I walked so slow

456
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,230
and held you back.

457
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,160
That’s not like that.
Don’t think too much.

458
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,950
Fei, what’s wrong?

459
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:44,400
It’s OK. I have suppressed it.

460
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,360
The Yellow and Green Spirit
caused trouble again?

461
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,690
Let me tell Xie.

462
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,280
No. Don’t.

463
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,430
It’s OK now.

464
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,720
Don’t let him worry.

465
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,510
Ladies, welcome.

466
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,640
Good job.

467
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,800
Here, have a seat.

468
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,190
Master, have a seat.

469
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,560
Move it backward a little bit.

470
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,190
OK.

471
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,830
Fei,

472
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,470
if we meet a rival like Dragon Master
again,

473
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,160
don’t act rashly.

474
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,230
Then, should I be a coward like you?

475
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,630
Turns out that I’m always a coward
in your mind.

476
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:38,880
I…

477
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,230
Fei!

478
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,780
“The old stones along the bridge
were covered with frost.”

479
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:19,010
“A man who travels far from home
will never return.”

480
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,560
It’s your new work?

481
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,800
New poem.

482
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,040
“Coward’s Forlornness”.

483
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,860
It was a bad joke.

484
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,870
You’re not a coward.

485
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,280
Fei,

486
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,590
you knew you couldn’t beat
Dragon Master.

487
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:40,000
Why did you promise Mr. Ji to do that?

488
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:43,910
I just wonder

489
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,110
why they could be so confidently

490
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,620
and proudly evil.

491
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,640
How can these villains

492
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,590
be so proud of

493
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,520
the gross injustice they did

494
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,400
more than 20 years ago

495
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,110
while the good guys

496
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,970
were already buried in earth?

497
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,470
They are just spoiled

498
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,150
by the silence of many people.

499
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,600
My new poem

500
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,870
is a story about a deserter.

501
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,680
What’s interesting about a deserter?

502
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,190
What’s interesting about a hero?

503
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,310
For the leisure time,

504
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,190
why don’t we have some stories
about being a coward?

505
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,160
Alright, alright.

506
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,070
If there is a chance,

507
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,830
I will tell the whole world

508
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,400
with eagerness and zest

509
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,350
that you, Xie Yun, are not a coward.

510
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,420
Thank you then.

511
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,110
You can go on

512
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,520
with your story about the deserter.

513
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,680
I really want to listen to it.

514
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,230
Before he became a deserter,

515
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,690
he thought he was a great hero

516
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,230
who could return home in honor

517
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,500
and marry the girl he loved.

518
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,640
But later he found

519
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,430
that the government

520
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,800
didn’t need him at all

521
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,510
and even didn’t regard him as a human.

522
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,730
He was just a living bait
to lure the enemy.

523
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,560
His mission would be completed

524
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,860
the moment when he died.

525
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,180
So,

526
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,020
he fled away.

527
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,830
Anzhi,

528
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,350
with all my life’s work,

529
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,830
I temporarily shut

530
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,880
-the poison in your veins.
-Uncle!

531
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,800
After that, you can no longer
use martial arts,

532
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,680
but, live well on behalf of me.

533
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,590
And then? What are you thinking about?

534
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,190
What happened to that deserter?

535
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:48,770
Nothing.

536
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,920
But when the deserter returned home

537
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,830
after many difficulties,

538
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,360
he didn’t find his girl.

539
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:55,900
Why?

540
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Because that girl is a…

541
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,950
Weed Spirit.

542
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,480
She had left riding a carp.

543
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,590
I… I have had enough rest.

544
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,560
I’ll go find some food there.

545
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,920
Fei!

546
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,280
Fei!

547
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,680
Oh, no. Her pulse condition is bad.

548
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,230
It must be because of the two spirits.

549
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,760
What to do now?

550
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,430
Hengyang.

551
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,230
Someone in Hengyang can save her.

552
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:40,830
But…

553
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,760
But what? Go ahead.

554
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,920
She is on the move.

555
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,680
I’m not sure if she is in the city.

556
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,200
We have to give it a try.

557
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,610
Who is it?

558
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,230
Fei, if you can hear me,

559
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,630
do me a favor.

560
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,690
We should escape now to save you.

561
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,790
Your Majesty?

562
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,710
Greeting, Your Majesty.

563
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,900
General Feiqing?

564
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,280
You’ve really kept a close following.

565
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,410
Your Majesty,

566
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,120
I have asked the soldiers to go back.

567
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,910
I have been waiting for you here.

568
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,320
Hope you can be safe.

569
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,430
What happened to Miss Zhou?

570
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,630
It’s a long story.

571
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,950
The situation is bad now anyway.

572
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:52,750
Your Majesty, please go back with me.

573
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,910
Miss Zhou’s disease

574
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,430
can’t be healed by the surgeon.

575
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,390
A master in Hengyang city can help her.

576
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,950
General Wen, see you.

577
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:00,950
But…

578
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,190
But what?

579
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,560
If something happens to Miss Zhou,

580
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,760
can you bear the blame?

581
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,150
General Wen,

582
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,760
if you really want to help,

583
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,470
you can help Miss Zhou to send

584
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,690
Miss Wu back to Mr. Gantang.

585
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,280
Miss Wu, you…

586
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,460
I’m willing to go with him.

587
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:28,150
Then, Fei is up to you.

588
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,870
Your Majesty, don’t worry.

589
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,640
Your Majesty, take care!

590
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,560
Dad, it hurts!

591
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:51,730
Fei,

592
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,720
does it still hurt now?

593
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,230
Yes.

594
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,790
What’s wrong?

595
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,950
Dad, why is

596
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,870
your back so hard today?

597
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,710
Hang in there, Fei.

598
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,800
Dad,

599
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,660
why is your back so hard?

600
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,520
Fei, what are you talking about?

601
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,190
Dad, when did you lose weight?

602
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:26,360
Your back feels harder than before.

603
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,800
Then please bear with it for now,

604
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,600
Yun.

605
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,860
Oh, it’s you. I mistook you.

606
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,990
What did you call me?

607
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,490
I said

608
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,190
if I have a daughter,

609
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,620
her childhood name would be Yun.

610
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,090
Someone mistook me as her dad.

611
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,470
What a girl.

612
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,140
Why are you still so naughty
when you got hurt?

613
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,190
Where are we going?

614
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,280
Just stay still.

615
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,670
We’re about to arrive in Hengyang.

616
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,610
Can you hold on any longer?

617
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:09,610
Yes. Faster. Be faster.

618
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,820
(Fortress of the Forty-Eight)

619
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,910
Leader,

620
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,010
it’s the fifth letter.

621
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:30,370
If Lord Gantang still doesn’t reply,

622
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:31,770
I’m afraid…

623
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,170
Steward Ma,

624
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,320
I need you to do me a favor.

625
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,600
Leader, please go ahead.

626
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,190
I could not get away from

627
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,320
the complicated affairs here.

628
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,670
Miss Wang has gone out for months

629
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,320
but we haven’t heard anything from her.

630
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,560
I don’t know if she has met
the children of General Wu.

631
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,800
Other elders haven’t gone out for long.

632
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,230
The situation outside is complicated.

633
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,470
After I thought about it,

634
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,080
I could only ask you to go out
to have a check.

635
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,360
It’s my job.

636
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,390
And, our secret service…

637
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,510
Leader, what’s the order about it?

638
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,000
Never mind.

639
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,280
Let’s talk about it later.

640
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,120
The first thing to do is to find
the children back.

641
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,630
Aunt. Aunt.

642
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,430
Sheng and Fei have gone out.

643
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,040
Only I am left here.

644
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,830
I can’t stand it!

645
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,230
What are you doing?

646
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,140
Just say it.

647
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,910
Uncle Ma,

648
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,910
look how poor I am!

649
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,670
They all abandoned me.

650
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,080
Who dares to abandon you?

651
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,190
Everyone here can’t

652
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,390
love you more.

653
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,630
-Who dares to leave you alone?
-Ma Jili!

654
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,190
She is so spoiled

655
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,470
and starts to be so unreasonable.

656
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,710
Auntie,

657
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,520
just let me follow Uncle Ma

658
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,320
to go out to find them.

659
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,190
I miss them!

660
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,950
I miss them so much!

661
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,520
Leader,

662
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,710
how about I take Yan’er
with me this time?

663
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,710
OK! Great!

664
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,600
Alright. Alright.

665
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:52,340
(Letter from Li Jinrong)

666
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:55,630
How many letters are there?

667
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,950
Lord,

668
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,270
it’s already the fifth letter.

669
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,540
The time between the letters became
shorter and shorter.

670
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:08,450
Looks like Li Jinrong starts to worry.

671
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,230
The fish is going to bite the hook.

672
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,120
Ask Gu Tianxian to get prepared.

673
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,320
Yes.

674
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,840
By the way,

675
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,930
I need to go to Hengyang

676
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,840
to meet an old friend of mine.

677
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,910
We will arrive at the Fortress

678
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,320
after days on this road.

679
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,910
I don’t know how my aunt
and other elders

680
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:39,870
will scold me.

681
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:45,670
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

682
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:49,080
Hyah! Hyah!

683
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,320
Hyah! Hyah!

684
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,630
Hyah!

685
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,760
Lord.

686
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,670
Lord.

687
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,280
We have been rushing for days.

688
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,500
(Gu Tianxian Demons Manor Giant Leopard)
How about we have a short rest here?

689
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,860
(Gu Tianxian Demons Manor Giant Leopard)

690
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,000
(Gu Tianxian Demons Manor Giant Leopard)
No.

691
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,150
We don’t have much time.

692
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,560
Our people

693
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,470
in Hengyang are still waiting for us.

694
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,150
In such a crisis,

695
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,750
they can’t take actions

696
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,840
without me.

697
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,730
They are people from Demons Manor.

698
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,320
What are they doing here?

699
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,000
Lord, if our time is limited,

700
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,230
I have an idea to save time.

701
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,800
Go ahead.

702
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,630
In the forest, there is

703
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,710
a path leading to Hengyang City.

704
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,080
If we take that path,

705
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,470
it will take less time.

706
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,360
That’s alright.

707
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,490
Then we can have a rest here

708
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,320
and after that

709
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,840
we can take the path

710
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,560
to go to the mountains.

711
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,360
Yes.

712
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,600
Hengyang?

713
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,000
What are they planning to do?

714
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,520
Miss Wu, I’m sorry

715
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,800
to let you take such a rough road.

716
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,230
But it’s safe here.

717
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,800
It’s more hidden than the high road.

718
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,630
General, it’s OK.

719
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,390
We can go faster actually.

720
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,790
Don’t delay the whole journey.

721
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,560
I wonder how Fei is now.

722
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Miss, please don’t worry.

723
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,760
His Majesty is there.

724
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,150
Miss Zhou must be safe.

725
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,440
That’s good.

726
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:16,750
Miss, be careful.

727
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,940
General, what’s wrong?

728
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,460
It’s a trap made by the hunters.

729
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,420
Looks like

730
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,110
there are many traps in this forest.

731
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,230
Listen, Miss Wu.

732
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,120
Please wait for me here.

733
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,600
I’ll go explore the way.
I’ll be right back.

734
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,710
General, take care.

735
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,470
Are you General Wu’s daughter?

736
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:09,510
Who are you?

737
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,390
Fei and I saw your portrait once.

738
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:14,950
I…

739
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,040
No time to explain.

740
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,280
People from the Demons Manor are behind.

741
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,150
You have to hide first.

742
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,040
Hurry up.

743
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,950
There are all traps.

744
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,080
Traps?

745
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,040
There. Let’s go there.

746
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:42,910
Sir,

747
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:44,250
why do you help me?

748
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,000
Listen,

749
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,230
I can get away safely.

750
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:49,280
But they can definitely recognize you.

751
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,430
If you are found,

752
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,870
both of us will be caught.

753
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,020
I’ll think of a way.

754
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:56,970
Take my sword for me.

755
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,280
Be careful.

756
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,520
Lord,

757
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,190
there is something in the forest ahead.

758
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:37,120
Go check it out.

759
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:37,910
-Yes.
-Yes.

760
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:56,000
Lord,

761
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,520
it’s a trap made by the hunters.

762
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,800
Someone fell into it.

763
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,630
Who is it?

764
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:03,280
It’s a young man around 20 years old.

765
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,150
I guess he is a passerby.

766
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,430
-Get him out to ask.
-Yes.

767
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,760
The hunters here are really cruel.

768
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,370
Get on.

769
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:36,230
Who are you?

770
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:40,520
Sir,

771
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,010
I’m a local hunter.

772
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:47,760
Ow!

773
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,660
Hunter?

774
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:52,120
-Can a hunter fall into his own trap?
-It hurts!

775
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,040
You’re lying.

776
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,390
Tell me the truth!

777
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:00,520
Guys,

778
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,080
you’re not locals, right?

779
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,870
You don’t know it.

780
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,430
There are hundreds of

781
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:08,630
hunters in this forest.

782
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:11,520
And also, there are more than

783
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,230
hundreds of traps they made here.

784
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:16,600
We also don’t know where the traps are

785
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,520
more than a mile away from home.

786
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,000
More than hundreds of traps?

787
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,560
You two,

788
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,430
go check it out.

789
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:24,190
-Yes.
-Yes.

790
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:33,970
Giant Leopard?

791
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,780
Turns out he is one of the Demons,

792
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,090
