17

When it’s dog-eat-dog between them,

18
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,550
we can take advantage of it.

19
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,120
That’s right.

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,080
First, Yu Wenzhi asked Pathetic Clam
to steal the tokens

21
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,160
then he told Shen Tianshu to rescue her.

22
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,590
With him in between,

23
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,040
those two will be suspicious
about each other

24
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,640
and won’t be of one mind.

25
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,900
Even if he’s delayed,

26
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,210
I can still make him

27
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,700
part of the game

28
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,940
to churn the waters

29
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,810
this time.

30
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,060
Are you saying...?

31
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,130
Isn’t it...?

32
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,130
Yes.

33
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,220
It belongs to Yu Wenzhi’s spy.

34
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,140
Since he’s colluding with Pathetic Clam,

35
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,420
I’ll use him

36
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,420
to drive a wedge

37
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,010
between Pathetic Clam and Shen Tianshu.

38
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,810
If they’re against each other,

39
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,730
she won’t

40
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,810
hand over the tokens to Shen Tianshu.

41
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,450
With those tokens in hand,

42
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,650
who will she

43
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,730
side with?

44
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,260
Aren’t those Demons

45
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,650
full of tricks and schemes?

46
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,170
Very well.

47
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,340
It’s payback time!

48
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,090
Let Shen Tianshu be hoist

49
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,700
with his own petard.

50
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,140
Lord Gu,

51
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,420
bad news.

52
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,980
The bridge has been destroyed.

53
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,930
There are no boats around.

54
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,500
How should we cross the river?

55
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,810
It must’ve been done on purpose.

56
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,170
Correct.

57
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,530
You have to beat me first

58
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,340
to join Shen Tianshu.

59
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,650
Madam Nichang,

60
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,620
why are you here?

61
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,980
What’s it to do with you?

62
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,650
I’m asked

63
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,420
to stop you here.

64
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,650
You think you chicks

65
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,570
are my match?

66
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,000
Gu Tianxian.

67
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,370
Long time no see.

68
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,860
What about us, too?

69
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,900
Are we your match together?

70
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,900
Go, go, go.

71
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,500
Let’s go.

72
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,780
Mr. Li,

73
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,900
my men found

74
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,290
eyes and ears of Demons here.

75
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,620
Please follow me.

76
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,900
Be careful and keep a low profile.

77
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,970
Fei and Mr. Xie arrived here yesterday.

78
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,010
Did anyone see them?

79
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,450
A beggar

80
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,570
saw a man and a woman earlier

81
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,290
who carried a long blade.

82
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,100
That must be them.

83
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,850
Please tell them

84
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,340
to meet us here.

85
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,500
Fei was injured
by Pathetic Clam yesterday.

86
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,380
I wonder how she is now.

87
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,170
Alright. I’m on it.

88
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,660
(Animal characters made by CG)

89
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,380
Madam Nichang.

90
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,620
Chief Xu,

91
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,130
did you also receive
a letter from Chuchu?

92
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,250
No.

93
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,130
It was Miss Zhou.

94
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,540
She asked me

95
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,690
to teach those bastards a lesson.

96
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,620
Luckily, I asked Madam Nichang for help.

97
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,820
Demons do have backups.

98
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,820
(Xiangdong Tavern)

99
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,660
Right after Lord Hu came back,

100
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,820
she argued with Lord Shen.

101
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,130
With those two together,

102
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,940
our chance of winning is slim.

103
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,820
Stop gossiping about her!

104
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,060
That’ll get you killed!

105
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,410
Let’s go.

106
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,500
(Xiangdong Tavern)

107
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,250
Have a seat, Miss.

108
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,780
Best wishes to you.

109
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,660
Says who?

110
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,410
Miss Zhou,

111
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,690
I’m with the Route Gang.

112
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,570
Mr. Li is waiting for you at the dock.

113
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,780
You can go join him.

114
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:38,780
Thanks.

115
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,340
You must be hungry.

116
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:49,660
Here.

117
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,730
Have some plum cakes.

118
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,380
That’ll help you remember things.

119
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,010
Why bother?

120
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,900
Feed her my poison.

121
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,820
The excruciating pain

122
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,900
will certainly help jog her memory.

123
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,340
Don’t scare her.

124
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,380
She can take her time.

125
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,500
Let’s play a game.

126
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,220
You’re a carpenter, right?

127
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,900
You need your hands

128
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,290
to support your family, don’t you?

129
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,130
The game we’re playing

130
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,900
is called Chopping off Fingers.

131
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,340
Here’s the rule.

132
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,810
On my count of three,

133
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,610
if you still don’t remember anything,

134
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,490
he’ll lose one finger.

135
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,420
Then I’ll count again.
If I still hear nothing,

136
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,420
he’ll lose one more.

137
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,420
Let’s see

138
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,220
how many fingers he’ll lose in total.

139
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,050
Let’s begin.

140
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,300
One.

141
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,610
No, no!

142
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,100
Two.

143
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,300
Three.

144
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,450
Stop! I’ll tell you.

145
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,420
I’ll write it down.

146
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,100
Young lady,

147
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,540
here’s a friendly reminder.

148
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,690
I’ve been looking for that treasure

149
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,690
long before you had been born.

150
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,010
Don’t you

151
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,810
try to fool me.

152
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,780
Li Sheng.

153
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,490
There you are.

154
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,180
Are you alright?

155
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,300
I’m fine.

156
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,300
Pathetic Clam and Shen Tianshu
are together now.

157
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,540
I know.

158
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,370
We’ve checked around the town

159
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,740
and figured out where their people are.

160
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,980
It’s too risky

161
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,490
for us to act alone.

162
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,660
The current situation is in favor of us.

163
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,180
I’ve thought up a plan

164
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,930
to cast in a bone between them.

165
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,980
Shen Tianshu is suspicious by nature.

166
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,100
He can’t tolerate any deception.

167
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,780
As his most trusted help,

168
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,860
Pathetic Clam is colluding
with Yu Wenzhi.

169
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,300
I’m sure she knows

170
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,860
Shen Tianshu is suspecting her.

171
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,540
She won’t

172
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,780
hand over those tokens easily.

173
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,220
They’re her biggest leverage.

174
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,660
So I bet they’re still on her.

175
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,900
That’s where we can come in

176
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,250
and drive a wedge

177
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,490
between them

178
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,010
to avoid battling Shen Tianshu head-on.

179
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,780
It’s us against them, isn’t it?

180
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,900
Let’s do it!

181
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,420
Why are you making it complicated?

182
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,610
Pathetic Clam is crafty.

183
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,450
Don’t leave her any wiggle room.

184
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,180
Beware of her.

185
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,220
You’re simple-minded.

186
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,570
Don’t hold us back.

187
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,340
Relax. I once battled her.

188
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,100
I’m aware of her tricks.

189
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:17,690
Alright.

190
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,980
Let’s split up.

191
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,050
If anything happens,

192
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,220
fire the whistling arrow

193
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,660
to alert each other.

194
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,860
Do not take risks.

195
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,010
Our enemies

196
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:30,810
are the top two

197
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,540
notorious Demons.

198
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,100
If you’re in danger,

199
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,180
or things go against you,

200
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,490
leave first.

201
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,780
We can abort the plan

202
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,050
and wait for another chance.

203
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,810
Yes, Madam.

204
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,300
Hang on.

205
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,130
You freaked me out.

206
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,610
Miss Zhou,

207
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,300
we still have resources here.

208
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,540
If you need anything,

209
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,300
don’t hesitate to tell me.

210
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,490
Sure. Thanks.

211
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,810
What did you say to Li Sheng?

212
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,740
Nothing special

213
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,660
other than a contingency plan.

214
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,220
I guess Shen Tianshu

215
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,780
didn’t take too many people with him.

216
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,490
We can

217
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,570
bluff him with the Anping Army

218
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,010
if necessary.

219
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,540
Let’s go.

220
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,900
Leave it to me.

221
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,660
I’ll lure him out.

222
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,340
Yang Jin,

223
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,900
you have to really sell it.

224
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,340
Don’t fall into

225
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,180
Pathetic Clam’s traps.

226
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,420
Got it.

227
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,570
And you stop Demons

228
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,010
with our men.

229
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,420
Good.

230
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,300
There you go.

231
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,340
Why are you crying?

232
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,980
Could you let us go?

233
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,250
Would you like a plum cake?

234
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,610
Alright.

235
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,810
Your job is done.

236
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,660
We don’t need you anymore.

237
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,690
Not yet.

238
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,860
Tianshu,

239
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,660
she humiliated me

240
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,420
back in the Cloud Ravine.

241
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,540
I must kill her!

242
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,130
Be patient.

243
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,610
Once you’re done crying,

244
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,540
recite the poem

245
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,370
from the beginning.

246
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,930
Then I’ll consider

247
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,780
if I’ll release you.

248
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,570
Let Senior Master Li go first.

249
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,780
Sure.

250
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,860
Why would I

251
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,490
keep a carpenter?

252
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,810
Tianshu,

253
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,340
you aren’t yourself today.

254
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,660
How could she lead you by the nose?

255
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,370
Tianying,

256
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,810
if she piled up a bunch of nonsense,

257
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,690
she couldn’t recite it accurately.

258
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,810
That’s why I’m asking her to do it.

259
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,810
If one word doesn’t match,

260
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,010
I’ll kill the carpenter.

261
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,370
And she can

262
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,420
have a taste of your poison.

263
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,980
Begin.

264
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:23,130
This dough figure is you, isn’t it?

265
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,860
It’s quite accurate.

266
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,540
I’ll do it. I’ll do it. I’ll do it.

267
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,180
“I go to Wuzhou to see you

268
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,930
where mountains appear at dusk.

269
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,050
Climb... Climb...”

270
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,570
Climb the mountain to overlook
the north or the south?

271
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,780
“Climb the mountain to
overlook the north of the river.

272
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,810
Send stones and Ganoderma.

273
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,100
The... The...

274
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,570
The valley is beautiful

275
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,010
where birds sing beautifully.

276
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,660
Music comes everywhere

277
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,300
when four songs are played”.

278
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,570
All correct.

279
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,930
Good. Well done.

280
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,220
Senior Master Li.

281
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,660
Senior Master Li, go.

282
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,570
Says who?

283
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,300
You...

284
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,740
Tianying,

285
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,860
let him go.

286
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,810
As seniors,

287
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,450
we shouldn’t lie to a girl.

288
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,250
Tianshu,

289
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,860
if you let him go, then what?

290
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,570
To alert his people?

291
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,690
People of the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight

292
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,660
could’ve followed me here.

293
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,690
It’s time to leave.

294
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,370
Tianying,

295
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,940
where are the five tokens?

296
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,850
Tokens?

297
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,820
I risked my life to get them for you.

298
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,330
Do you know how dangerous it was?

299
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,580
Zhou Fei almost killed me!

300
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,330
Tianying,

301
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,850
that poem

302
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:24,580
is the clue to finding the treasure.

303
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,700
We’re all set.

304
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,090
Give me the tokens

305
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,370
and we’ll head to
the Big Medicine Valley

306
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:30,780
to get the Book of Almighty Medicine

307
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,700
to treat you.

308
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,730
The Big Medicine Valley?

309
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,250
Sure.

310
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,300
Only if you kill her first.

311
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,610
What’s wrong? You can’t do it?

312
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,580
Tianying,

313
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:51,250
just ignore that girl.

314
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,210
Fine. I’m off.

315
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,110
Tianying,

316
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,150
you...

317
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,840
Do you still care about me?

318
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,750
Why are you doing this?

319
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,360
“Flowers will grow better next year.

320
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,230
Who will enjoy them with me?”

321
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,200
Tianshu,

322
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,320
am I already

323
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,870
a withered flower in your eyes?

324
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,600
What makes you say that?

325
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,390
I tolerated them for so long

326
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,360
only to find
the Color of Ocean and Heaven for you.

327
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,030
Tianying,

328
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:48,440
don’t argue with me about the tokens.

329
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,030
If it’s for me as you said,

330
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,840
does it matter

331
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,270
who keeps them?

332
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,390
Don’t you trust me?

333
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,200
Look at you.

334
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,390
Listen to yourself.

335
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,360
Every street is under Demons’ watch.

336
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,680
We must be careful.

337
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,560
If... If you kill me,

338
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,870
my aunt will avenge my death.

339
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:23,840
She’s poisoned.

340
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,680
Maybe she’s dead before you.

341
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,030
Liar!

342
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,110
That’s impossible!

343
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,480
What’s Yan doing here?

344
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,440
So the girl Demons mentioned is...

345
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,510
is Yan!

346
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,320
I asked her

347
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,800
to buy osmanthus liquor for you.

348
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,910
I didn’t know...

349
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,630
Fei,

350
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,480
it’s my fault.

351
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,870
She got caught

352
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,750
because of me.

353
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,150
How about this?

354
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,600
I’ll ask Shen Tianshu to take me

355
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,870
and let her go.

356
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,480
No!

357
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,200
Hear me out, Fei.

358
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,150
I’ll be his hostage

359
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,600
and get Li Yan out.

360
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,680
Then

361
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,110
I’ll use Gu Tianxian
caught by the Route Gang

362
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,390
to cut a deal with Shen Tianshu.

363
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,800
That way, I can stall them

364
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,680
and

365
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,800
make it easier for Li Sheng

366
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,870
to lure Pathetic Clam out.

367
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,510
But...

368
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,990
Don’t worry.

369
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,720
Shen Tianshu is in debt to my father.

370
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,910
He won’t harm me for old times’ sake.

371
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,440
Besides,

372
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,720
I have questions for him about the past.

373
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,600
All that will be enough to distract him.

374
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,600
Alright. Once I get Li Yan

375
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,910
and take her back,

376
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,630
I’ll wait for you outside.

377
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,750
Be very careful.

378
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,360
If things go south,

379
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,030
I’ll pull you out immediately.

380
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,630
With you protecting me in the dark,

381
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,720
I have nothing to fear.

382
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,960
Xie Yun, don’t get hurt,

383
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,080
or I’ll feed you to sharks,

384
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,200
alive or dead.

385
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,150
Fei,

386
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,720
one lapse can lead to death.

387
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,910
I’m depending on you.

388
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,990
How could you?

389
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,110
We had a deal

390
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,600
that if I wrote down the poem,

391
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,110
you’d let me go.

392
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,720
How could you go back on your word?

393
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,990
You sure can talk.

394
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,720
Let me

395
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,680
stitch your lips together.

396
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,390
Tianying, hurry up.

397
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,080
We have more important things to do.

398
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,840
Shen Tianshu,

399
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,990
aren’t you ashamed

400
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,390
of bullying a girl?

401
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,720
Well,

402
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,110
blame yourself

403
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,960
for not being stupid enough.

404
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,320
Lord Shen,

405
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,800
it’s been a while.

406
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,390
Xie Yun!

407
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,720
Are you ganging up

408
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,800
on a girl?

409
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,910
Your Majesty,

410
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,750
what brings you here?

411
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,990
I heard that my naive cousin

412
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,390
offended you,

413
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,910
so I’m here to apologize.

414
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,960
Please be lenient

415
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,150
and let her go.

416
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,390
Why should I?

417
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,200
Don’t get me wrong.

418
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,510
I’m here to propose

419
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,080
a swap.

420
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,200
Take me instead of her.

421
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,960
Fair enough, isn’t it?

422
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,200
Now that you are here,

423
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,480
I can keep both of you.

424
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,910
You can.

425
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,720
But I’m afraid

426
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,560
that’ll get you into trouble.

427
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,910
How so?

428
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:57,910
Without Li Jinrong,

429
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,990
how could the rest of you

430
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:04,480
cause me trouble?

431
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,630
We couldn’t

432
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,510
if Gu Tianxian and his force

433
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,990
were here

434
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,910
to help you.

435
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,750
But too bad...

436
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,680
Report!

437
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,390
Lord Gu and his men

438
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,150
are intercepted halfway.

439
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,230
Lord Gu is with one of my friends.

440
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,510
Yan is just

441
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,230
an ignorant girl.

442
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,680
Let her go

443
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,720
in exchange for your right-hand man.

444
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,510
You won’t say no

445
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,560
to such a great deal, will you?

446
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,680
Why should I believe you?

447
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,990
You have eyes and ears
all over the Central Plains.

448
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,480
They’ll soon send the news to you.

449
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,270
If it’s not here

450
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,750
by midnight,

451
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,200
you can kill me.

452
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,480
Deal. You stay.

453
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,870
She can leave.

454
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,560
Xie Yun.

455
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,200
Sorry for disturbing you.

456
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,990
Go. Don’t look back.

457
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,270
Tianshu, you...

458
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,910
Calm down, Tianying.

459
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,360
He and I go way back.

460
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,800
Give us a minute.

461
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,600
I’ll explain everything to you later.

462
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,480
Inform Chief Xu

463
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,800
to release Gu Tianxian.

464
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,360
Must we?

465
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,110
A promise is a promise.

466
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,230
Don’t make Mr. Xie look bad. Go.

467
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,150
Yes.

468
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,750
Li Yan!

469
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,200
Come here.

470
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,360
Fei.

471
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,840
I’ll take you to see
Yang Jin and Li Sheng.

472
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,320
No need. Go on with your work.

473
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,990
I’ll go tell them myself.

474
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,110
You can’t protect yourself.

475
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,480
Don’t be stubborn.

476
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,200
Let’s go!

477
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,720
Bonehead,

478
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,750
she’s all yours.

479
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,990
I’ll go get Xie Yun out.

480
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,440
Behave yourself!

481
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,200
Zhou Fei...

482
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,230
Bonehead,

483
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,360
I thought I’d never see you again.

484
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,560
I’m glad you’re back.

485
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,480
Did I get Xie Yun in trouble?

486
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,510
No worries. Zhou Fei will help him out.

487
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,360
But...

488
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,720
She’ll have to confront Shen Tianshu.

489
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,750
Will she be in danger?

490
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,630
She’s as ferocious

491
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,870
as him.

492
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,080
What’s that supposed to mean?

493
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,600
Yan,

494
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,800
our men will take you
back to the Fortress

495
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,390
to keep you away from the battle later.

496
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,480
That’s your brother’s order

497
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,390
to ensure your safety.

498
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,600
I understand. I’ll stay here.

499
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,390
Be careful out there.

500
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,720
Lord Hu,

501
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,230
Commander-in-Chief’s man came

502
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,270
and said he’s here, too.

503
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,150
Lord Shen

504
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,440
will receive him in person.

505
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,910
Why did he come to me?

506
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,990
He said this would give you a clue.

507
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,680
What else did he say?

508
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,560
He said...

509
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,110
He’s waiting for you
at the pavilion outside.

510
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,750
If you don’t show up,

511
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,480
conditions he agreed on

512
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,230
will be withdrawn.

513
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:04,230
Just as I expected.

514
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,960
Who else knows about this?

515
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,200
This message is for you only.

516
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,080
I wouldn’t dare tell others about it.

517
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,200
Good. You can keep secrets.

518
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,560
I should reward you.

519
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,990
Lord Hu.

520
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,480
I killed him

521
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,510
for disrespect. Is there a problem?

522
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,800
Of course not.

523
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,990
I’m going out for a walk

524
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,510
and I’ll be back soon.

525
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,960
Don’t say things you shouldn’t.

526
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,840
I wouldn’t dare.

527
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,910
But what if Lord Shen asks about you?

528
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,030
If he does

529
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,360
before I’m back,

530
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,680
just tell him,

531
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,390
“Flowers will grow better next year.

532
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,600
Who will enjoy them with me?”

533
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
Remember,

534
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,150
do not say that to him

535
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,360
until he looks anxious.

536
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:10,720
Yes. You can count on me.

537
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,150
Clean up the mess.

538
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:13,840
Yes.

539
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,150
Tianshu, someday,

540
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,800
you’ll realize

541
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,080
only I love you wholeheartedly.

542
00:28:54,780 --> 00:29:06,420
(Wood Workshop)

543
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,990
I’m surprised that this bland tea

544
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,630
is to your taste, Lord Shen.

545
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,840
You must’ve

546
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,750
been through a lot.

547
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,320
You’re still in the mood for tea.

548
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,480
What makes you so certain

549
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,440
that I won’t kill you?

550
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,960
My father

551
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,110
saved your life once.

552
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,910
That’s enough

553
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,800
for you to keep me
until midnight, isn’t it?

554
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:00,200
I’m not an ingrate.

555
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,510
Fine.

556
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:05,510
Midnight it is.

557
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,750
Your father is gone

558
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,910
but you still remember his past.

559
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:24,560
Have you forgotten about it?

560
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,960
When my family members were killed,

561
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:30,960
your father recruited me
to the Anping Army.

562
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,390
Yes, just as I heard.

563
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,480
This kind of story never grows old

564
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,390
between a compassionate man

565
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,200
and an ungrateful wolf.

566
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,320
Wang Lin called me an ungrateful wolf?

567
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,510
You know what,

568
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,870
that should be

569
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,800
Zhou Yitang.

570
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:59,960
Wang Lin trusted him the most,

571
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,990
yet he stole the Tally for a woman

572
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:05,600
to dispatch troops to help
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

573
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:10,230
Then he removed his skills,
left the Anping Army

574
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:14,480
and claimed that
he wished to repay his master.

575
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,200
That was the last time Wang Lin saw him!

576
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,630
Compared with him,

577
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,510
I’m nothing.

578
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,560
Why did you

579
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,720
also quit?

580
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:34,390
Didn’t Wang Lin tell you that?

581
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,960
I was too busy practicing skills

582
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,110
to come out.

583
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,360
I didn’t realize until now

584
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,960
how different

585
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,990
the younger generation is.

586
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,320
I’m flattered.

587
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,360
Zhou Yitang,

588
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,270
it took us three months of siege,

589
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,600
ten days of attacks to take this city

590
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,480
at the loss of half of our men.

591
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,600
Yet here you are,
Wang Lin’s beloved disciple,

592
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,840
sitting here bossing others around.

593
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,360
I make the rules

594
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,200
on the battlefield.

595
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,510
Those are your own rules.

596
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,270
Why did you kill the captives?

597
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,630
We risked our lives

598
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:39,150
to win this city

599
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:42,030
and we deserve to enjoy ourselves.

600
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,510
Or why should we serve you?

601
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,720
We’re the ones

602
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,480
fighting on the battlefield
for Wang Lin.

603
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,600
If there are

604
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,110
so many rules to follow,

605
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,080
I might as well quit.

606
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,960
Let’s go

607
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,910
if you’d like to join me.

608
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:01,030
Let’s go.

609
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,080
Hold on.

610
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,360
That’s it? You’re leaving?

611
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,910
Fine.

612
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,440
I’ll give you something

613
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,320
to show Wang Lin.

614
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,230
Leader!

615
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:37,990
No wonder

616
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,750
you attempted to kill
Lord Gantang over and over.

617
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,390
He didn’t deserve to be the commander.

618
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,870
So by your logic,

619
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,560
the weak can only

620
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,230
blame themselves for being killed.

621
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,910
Do you remember

622
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:01,210
you were one of them

623
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,510
when my father first found you?

624
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,670
General Wang Lin told me

625
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,750
that he established the Anping Army

626
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,030
to protect the masses

627
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:19,030
from harm.

628
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,270
Mr. Zhou has followed in

629
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,400
his footsteps in that regard.

630
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,270
That’s why I was asked

631
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:29,230
to bring this badge

632
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,030
to him.

633
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,080
(Anping Army)
Turns out,

634
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,920
I made the right choice.

635
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:49,510
Since then, the Xiaos
have run out of their luck

636
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:53,120
and the Anping Army has fallen apart.

637
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,600
Once I open
the Color of Ocean and Heaven,

638
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,030
I’ll build my own force

639
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:01,230
100 times stronger than Anping

640
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,190
and crush Zhou Yitang.

641
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,640
My lord,

642
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,640
it’s been confirmed that
Lord Gu and his men

643
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,840
were ambushed on the way here

644
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,120
by the Route Gang and Yuyi Troupe.

645
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,990
I see.

646
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,320
Lord Shen,

647
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:31,230
see? I told you so.

648
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,360
Yes.

649
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,080
It’s already midnight.

650
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,750
Let’s see

651
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,470
if anyone will swap you out

652
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,470
the same as you did to that girl.

653
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,840
Commander is occupied. Please hold on.

654
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,560
Why did you come all the way

655
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,230
to see me?

656
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,400
It’s you!

657
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,160
Seize her!

658
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,120
She poisoned Leader Li!

659
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,270
I’m too careless

660
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:21,120
to see through your shallow trick.

661
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,320
Kill her for Leader!

662
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,320
Watch out for the poison!

663
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,920
Capture her! Go!

664
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:31,880
-Yes!
-Let’s go!

665
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,920
Your Majesty,

666
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,670
my patience has run out.

667
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,560
Looks like your help

668
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:03,320
didn’t come as expected.

669
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,360
Lord Shen,

670
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,600
you can’t kill me.

671
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:15,080
What makes you so sure?

672
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,080
Because he’s here.

673
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,470
Report!

674
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,600
Lord Shen, Lord Hu...

675
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,470
Speak!

676
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,990
She went to meet with
Yu Wenzhi in private.

677
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,710
She has all the tokens.

678
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,190
Go get her back.

679
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,320
Yes.

680
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,710
Why bother?

681
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,750
Yu Wenzhi has had them all.

682
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:52,950
It’s too late.

683
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,560
You lured him here, didn’t you?

684
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,670
You’re old

685
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,270
and grumpy.

686
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,230
Too bad,

687
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:14,670
you’ve thrown good money after bad.

688
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,120
You didn’t expect

689
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,800
he and your woman
would be so close

690
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,670
that they’d stab you
in the back, did you?

691
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,600
Now,

692
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,800
they’re probably on their way back.

693
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,430
So they’re your help.

694
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,160
Unfortunately,

695
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,160
no one can help you now.

696
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,670
Given your condition,

697
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:52,560
I can kill you in a second.

698
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,400
Wrong! His help is here.

699
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,640
Fei.

700
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,600
Lord Shen,

701
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,470
take a guess.

702
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,360
How long will it take you

703
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,750
to kill me?

704
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,080
This is

705
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:23,360
all your trick, isn’t it?

706
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,400
Correct. Let him go.

707
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,190
Lord Shen,

708
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:32,430
when a snipe and a clam fight,
the fisherman wins.

709
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:35,920
Yu Wenzhi would love

710
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,880
seeing us coming at each other.

711
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,470
Are you alright?

712
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:49,560
I’m fine.

713
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,670
So quiet.

714
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,750
Anping Army? Why are they here?

715
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:29,840
Lord Shen,

716
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,880
before Lord Hu left,

717
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,640
she left you a message that

718
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,800
“Flowers will grow better next year.
Who will enjoy them with me?”

719
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,430
Hou Zuo,

720
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,880
ask our men

721
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,880
to stop the Anping Army.

722
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,470
Yes.

723
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,840
You two follow me.

724
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,190
Li Sheng!

725
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,670
Pathetic Clam is gone.

726
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,840
That’s bad.

727
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,670
If she and Shen Tianshu get together,

728
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:03,360
Fei will be in danger.

729
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,190
Over there!

730
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,400
Yang Jin, take care of them.

731
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,510
I’ll go find Fei.

732
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:39,510
No problem.

733
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,560
Tianshu,

734
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,470
someday,

735
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:36,030
you’ll realize

736
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:39,270
only I love you wholeheartedly.

737
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:40,160
Lord Hu.

738
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,670
Commander-in-Chief’s man came

739
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,640
and said he’s here, too.

740
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:50,600
Report!

741
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,470
No sign of Lord Hu.

742
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:55,640
We don’t know
if she’s surrounded by enemies.

743
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,840
Kill everyone

744
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,230
in the way. No exception.

745
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:03,030
Yes.

746
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,880
Where are the tokens? Say it!

747
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:09,230
Leave when you still can.

748
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,640
Tianshu will soon be here.

749
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,270
Then it’ll be too late.

750
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,840
Fei.

751
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,560
Are you alright?

752
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,880
All good.

753
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,800
Upon receiving Pathetic Clam’s message,

754
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,230
Shen Tianshu rushed to leave
without battling us.

755
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,160
That’s odd.

756
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:32,560
Their man said

757
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,030
he had left.

758
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:37,840
That fast?

759
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,880
No way!

760
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,560
When he left,

761
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,430
the tokens were still on you.

762
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,470
No way!

763
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,800
I gave everything to him.

764
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:56,470
He wouldn’t abandon me.

765
00:44:57,190 --> 00:45:00,840
He needs the Color of Ocean and Heaven

766
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,800
to save me
with the Book of Almighty Medicine.

767
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:06,190
He wouldn’t leave me behind.

768
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,510
Book of Almighty Medicine?

769
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,230
The one belongs to
the Big Medicine Valley?

770
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:16,640
Yes.

771
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,320
Book of Almighty Medicine

772
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,430
includes cures for Worry-burying,

773
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:22,950
Bone-chilling

774
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,230
and every poison in the world.

775
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:29,430
Without you,

776
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:33,120
I would’ve been together with Tianshu.

777
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,160
A treacherous killer like you

778
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,800
bought such nonsense?

779
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:44,270
Li Sheng, Zhou Fei,

780
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:47,230
Lord Gantang is back safe and sound.

781
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,120
