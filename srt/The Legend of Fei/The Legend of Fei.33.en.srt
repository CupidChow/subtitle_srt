Can it go up to the snow mountain?

Yes, it can.

00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,670
Go check other horses, then.

51
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,440
Forget it. I don’t have time.
I’ll take this one.

what you asked me to do.

looks good,

58
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,160
but it isn’t cold-resistant at all.

59
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,030
It won’t make it to the snow mountain.

Sir.

71
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,510
I know you don’t want to be our burden.

72
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,600
But it’s too late

73
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,950
to go separate ways.

74
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,880

pin it on us.

76
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,040

I don’t care where you’re going.

and bury you.

you’re also after the secret,

hunt you down.

Their enemy

102

must be our friend, right?

103

I’ll at least be alive to take revenge.

You’re so good at making trouble.

I’m afraid I can’t live so long.

106
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,270
I think no one is in.

107
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,440
No one?

108
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,230
Then who closed the door?

109
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,790
Get out of the way.
I’ll split open the door.

110
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,640
Yeah, Bonehead.

111

Go.

Who are you?

116

Come out. They’re not bad men.

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,950
Don’t be scared. Come out.

118
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:30,350
Hyah! Hyah!

119
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,790

120
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,640
According to the horseshoe marks,

121
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,440
they went this way.

122
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,160
After them!

123
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,920
Hyah!

124
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,830
The wound has been dressed.

125
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,230
You’re no longer bleeding, too.

126
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,270
You’re just children.

127
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,440
Why are you all hiding
in such a shabby temple?

128
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,270
We’re schoolmates.

129
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,000
We went to the same school
in our hometown.

130
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,720
War broke out there.

131
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,230
Our villagers ran away.

132
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,110
Our parents and we lost each other.

133
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,760
Luckily, we met a kind teacher

134
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,440
who led us forward.

135
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,880
He said there was no war in the south.

136
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,000
He had planned to take us to the south.

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,950
We found this shabby temple on our way

138
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,950
as a temporary shelter.

139
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,950
Where is the teacher, then?

140
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,230
Hearing that the Demons came around,

141
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,830
he’s gone out to see what’s happening.

142
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,670
He’ll be back soon, I guess.

143
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,880
Wait.

144
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:28,390
You just said there was no war
in the south?

145
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,480
Hou Jian is dead?

146
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,640
What about His Majesty?

147
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,150
What about Governor Huang?

148
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,440
Who is Hou Jian?

149
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,390
Who is Governor Huang?

150
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,470
I heard of him from the teacher.

151
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,320
Hou Jian was a rebel
against the former dynasty.

152
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,240
But he’s been dead
for over twenty years.

153
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,440
Sir, is this the man you asked about?

154
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,300
You’re dying.

155
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,050
What the hell are you doing?

156
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,100
You just said the former dynasty?

157
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,370
Hou Jian has been dead?

158
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,690
Who is the emperor in the south now?

159
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,450
Sir, what’s wrong with you?

160
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,570
Emperor Xuan, of course.

161
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:11,370
Who is that? What about His Majesty?

162
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,690
What about Governor Huang Shenbian?

163
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,690
Huang Shenbian?

164
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,980
I heard of him from my uncle.

165
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,930
But he’s also been dead
for over twenty years.

166
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,660
Governor Huang fought hard

167
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,930
and pledged to defend His Majesty.

168
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,610
But they’re all dead?

169
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,780
The Xiao family is gone.

170
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,050
His Majesty is gone.

171
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,780
That explains. That explains.

172
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,930
Sir, did you break your head

173
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,780
when you fell?

174
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,050
Let’s go.

175
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,370
The Demons will easily catch up
according to the horseshoe marks.

176
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,930
Go, or it’ll be too late.

177
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,340
Sir, your wound has been dressed.

178
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,420
Let’s go.

179
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,610
No!

180
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,610
So many children in the temple.

181
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,050
Can they leave?

182
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,980
If the Demons track us down,

183
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,980
they must know

184
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,610
we’ve come this way.

185
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,050
If they fail to find us,

186
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,420
they will hurt these children,

187
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,740
considering how evil they are.

188
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,370
They’re after us!

189
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,810
Why will they hurt these children?

190
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,930
If the Demons were
as simple-minded as you,

191
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,300
the world would have been in peace.

192
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,010
Sir.

193
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,930
If the Demons break in,

194
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,610
we’ll try to hold them back.

195
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,690
You can run away

196
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,740
with these children.

197
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,900
Girl.

198
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,570
You don’t even know who I am.

199
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,220
Why do you help me?

200
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,900
You don’t need to fight the Demons

201
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,420
for a mere stranger.

202
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,900
We, the Fortress of the Forty-Eight,

203
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,420
have fought the Demons many times.

204
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,180
Fortress of the Forty-Eight?

205
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,370
Who...?

206
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,100
Who is Li Zheng to you?

207
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,610
You know my grandfather?

208
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,010
Sir.

209
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,860
We risked our lives
to keep you safe all the way.

210
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,810
Now you know who we are.

211
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,740
Shouldn’t you tell us who you are?

212
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,100
I’m Liu Youliang.

213
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,180
I’m just an old grave keeper,

214
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,860
unknown to the public.

215
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,010
The Demons sent Tong Tianyang

216
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,900
for a mere grave keeper?

217
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,300
What if there’s treasure in the grave

218
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,900
that can conquer the whole world?

219
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,900
Treasure.

220
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,250
Treasure?

221
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,220
Girl, come over.

222
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,300
Don’t go.

223
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,570
Sir, you haven’t answered

224
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,010
our question yet.

225
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,300
Who exactly are you?

226
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,540
You’re so anxious about my identity?

227
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,450
My identity doesn’t matter.

228
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,900
What I’ve been guarding matters most!

229
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,690
I’m a bodyguard
of Governor Huang Shenbian.

230
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,980
When putting down the rebellion,

231
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,900
Governor Huang transferred me
out of the army,

232
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,690
to guard something,

233
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,370
named the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

234
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,050
-The Color of Ocean and Heaven again?
-The Color of Ocean and Heaven again?

235
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,180
Yeah.

236
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,050
Your grandfather was
one of the guardians.

237
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,010
You must have heard of it.

238
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,660
Governor Huang said

239
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,300
he would send someone
with the ripple-shaped object

240
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,690
after putting down the rebellion.

241
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,130
I would help to get out
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

242
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,930
Unexpectedly,

243
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,570
I waited for over twenty years.

244
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,300
Over twenty years?

245
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,900
Sir, were you all alone

246
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,740
during these years?

247
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,340
Yeah, I was all alone.

248
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,570
No.

249
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,570
I don’t even know what I am now,

250
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:57,370
a lonely human or a ghost?

251
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,050
All right.

252
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,980
After giving him some energy

253
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,100
and feeding him the decoction,

254
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:27,450
we can finally keep him alive
for the moment.

255
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,860
Tongming.

256
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,660
How long can the decoction effect last?

257
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,780
As far as I see,

258
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,450
one month, at most.

259
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,010
(Chen Junfu, Immortal of Penglai)
You must be kidding.

260
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,980
Even if you go personally,

261
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,300
it’ll take more than one month
to get the Fire Lotus.

262
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,300
Not to mention that young girl.

263
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,340
I trust her.

264
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,130
If she can’t come back in one month,

265
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,130
how...

266
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,250
how can we help Anzhi?

267
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,860
It’s her predestined fate.

268
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,180
It’s also Anzhi’s.

269
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,010
The Three-kind Decoction

270
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,780
will force out his last vitality

271
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,450
so that he won’t be a cold dead body

272
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,860
without any movement.

273
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,300
But after taking one dose,

274
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,810
he’ll lose some vitality.

275
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,180
After taking three doses,

276
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,050
if we still can’t find the antidote...

277
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,980
Then why did you use
such a strong decoction?

278
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,980
He fights against Bone-chilling
with his force.

279
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,420
Once he becomes weak,

280
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,930
he can’t be saved.

281
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,130
Even if we find
the Book of Almighty Medicine,

282
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,300
it won’t help.

283
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,900
Have you got any clue about the Book?

284
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,010
His Junior Master Lin and I
have travelled for years,

285
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,780
but haven’t found any clue.

286
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:00,130
Big Medicine Valley has been destroyed,

287
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,050
even without a single heir.

288
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,780
Maybe the Book of Almighty Medicine

289
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,220
was burnt into ashes

290
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,740
in the fire of Big Medicine Valley.

291
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,690
Go!

292
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,570
Go!

293
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,010
Go!

294
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,420
Forget it.

295
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,050
Since you don’t want to go,

296
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,570
wait here for me.

297
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,180
Excuse me.

298
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,090
Did you see a girl
with a long blade on her back?

299
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:51,490
Yes.

300
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,060
Did she go that away?

301
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,370
Yes.

302
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,730
I’ve never seen
such a stubborn girl like her.

303
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,610
Do you know her?

304
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,730
It’s very dangerous over there.

305
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,010
There was a snowstorm, wasn’t there?

306
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,490
Yeah.

307
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,090
How did you know?

308
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,460
You’re native?

309
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,970
After the snowstorm,

310
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,490
there’s always an avalanche.

311
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,490
She’s just in time.

312
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,700
You know there was a snowstorm

313
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,660
and you’re still going up the mountain?

314
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,850
Are you trying to kill yourself?

315
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,330
Will a wolf of the snow mountain

316
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,820
fear the snowstorm?

317
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,780
Are...? Are you...?

318
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,540
Snow Wolf?

319
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,780
It’s said

320
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,420
that you grew up in a wolf’s den,

321
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,940
Snow Wolf is back! Snow Wolf is back!

322
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,970
Snow Wolf is back! Snow Wolf is back!

323
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,370
At first,

324
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,580
Mr. Chongxiao and I

325
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,010
often wrote letters to each other.

326
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,900
But...

327
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,940
He never told me

328
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,700
there was a new emperor.

329
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,090
I think

330
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:26,730
he doesn’t want me to leave
without permission.

331
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,250
What is

332
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,820
the Color of Ocean and Heaven?

333
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,850
So many people died to guard it.

334
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,900
The saddest part is

335
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,900
after guarding it for over twenty years,

336
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,850
I still don’t know what it is.

337
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,250
Nor do I know

338
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,780
who I should give it to.

339
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,300
Well, this is life.

340
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,540
Well, it’s not the worst.

341
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,730
These days,

342
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,090
Mr. Chongxiao hasn’t written to me.

343
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,180
You can’t imagine

344
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,210
how I felt.

345
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,420
It was so quiet.

346
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,300
Around me,

347
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,460
there were only ghosts and wind.

348
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:17,180
I couldn’t help leaving that place,

349
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,730
trying to find Mr. Chongxiao.

350
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,180
Mr. Chongxiao?

351
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,250
I heard of him from my brother.

352
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,180
He knew Mr. Chongxiao.

353
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,730
When we’re out of trouble,

354
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,730
I’ll ask my brother to look for him.

355
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,970
It’s too late, I’m afraid.

356
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,490
As soon as I came out,

357
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,580
I knew the ripple pattern
appeared again.

358
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,780
It’s something

359
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,540
Governor Huang tried hard to hide.

360
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,900
But it was discussed in public

361
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,900
at the funny
Demon-Extermination Assembly.

362
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,940
How ridiculous!

363
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,820
I had planned to go to the Assembly

364
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,370
and see what was happening.

365
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,900
Unexpectedly,

366
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,580
an old acquaintance from the palace

367
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,940
found me.

368
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,420
The Demons

369
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,580
also ran after me.

370
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,820
You mean Chu Tianyu?

371
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,780
Girl, you know a lot.

372
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,970
My cousin and Ying Hecong killed him.

373
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,130
I certainly know him.

374
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,300
Something is wrong.

375
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,540
They’re catching up.

376
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,370
Girl, take this.

377
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:33,330
Sir.

378
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,460
What’s this?

379
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,660
Recite it.

380
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,540
What’s the red part?

381
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,060
Recite the poem at the back.

382
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,970
Poem?

383
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,500
(Send stones to the north of the river
and climb the mountain for Ganoderma.)

384
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,730
I’m ordered
to guard the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

385
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,090
Except me,

386
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:51,900
no other living men

387
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,210
know its location.

388
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,460
Now,

389
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,130
I’m giving this secret to you.

390
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,660
Recite the map,

391
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,820
so that the Color of Ocean and Heaven
won’t disappear.

392
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,090
The hard work of a generation

393
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,940
will not be wasted.

394
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,460
-Hyah.
-Hyah.

395
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,920
(Music comes everywhere
when four songs are played.)

396
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,380
(The valley is beautiful
where birds sing beautifully.)

397
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,460
(Send stones to the north of the river
and climb the mountain for Ganoderma.)

398
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,500
(I go to Wuzhou to see you
where mountains appear at dusk.)

399
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,580
Kids.

400
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,780
No matter what happens,

401
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,660
do not come out.

402
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,460
(Lanruo Temple)

403
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,420
(Lanruo Temple)

404
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:44,420
Get out of the way and let them leave.

405
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,460
Otherwise,

406
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,010
I’ll tear the map!

407
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,660
Fine. Fine.

408
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,130
Don’t be nervous.

409
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,300
Liu Youliang,

410
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,660
give me the map,

411
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,250
and I’ll let them go.

412
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,460
Sir, don’t give it to them.

413
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,820
If you do, we can’t leave!

414
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,300
Shut up!

415
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,490
Do...? Do you think

416
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,370
you still have the right

417
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,090
to choose?

418
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:07,610
You must keep your promise.

419
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,090
You!

420
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,730
Sir, don’t give it to him.

421
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:10,700
Don’t worry, girl.

422
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,730
At last!

423
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,210
At last, I’ve found what Lord wants!

424
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,300
Why is there a poem?

425
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,820
Run!

426
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,610
Sir! Sir!

427
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,010
Run!

428
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:39,850
Sir!

429
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,210
Go! Hurry!

430
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,060
Sir!

431
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,420
Go!

432
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:45,610
Go!

433
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,780
-Sir.
-Go!

434
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,820
Go!

435
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,300
Why?

436
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,580
What did you do?

437
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,210
Why is it burnt?

438
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,730
You want to know?

439
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,850
But I won’t tell you!

440
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,660
It’s been nearly ten days.

441
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,370
Still no message from that girl?

442
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,490
If she travels fast,

443
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,580
she has just arrived at the foot
of the snow mountain.

444
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,060
Be patient.

445
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,460
Look at him.

446
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,330
He’s such a good young man.

447
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,490
He left us for years.

448
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,490
When he comes back, he’s dying.

449
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,610
If I knew it,

450
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,330
I wouldn’t have given Anzhi to Wang Lin,

451
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,490
no matter how he persuaded me.

452
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,820
Anzhi decided

453
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,730
where he would go.

454
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:49,730
None of us

455
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,250
could decide

456
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,940
for him.

457
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,060
After the mutiny
against the former dynasty,

458
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,820
Anzhi was saved and sent to us.

459
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,330
None of us had raised a baby.

460
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:05,130
We were busy taking care of him.

461
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,940
When he first stood up,

462
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,210
he was this tall.

463
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,210
When he grew a bit up,

464
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,820
he began to fool us around

465
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,330
every day.

466
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,820
If I remember correctly,

467
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:19,060
when Wang Lin found us,

468
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,780
he was

469
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,580
just this tall.

470
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,490
Yes. Yes.

471
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:23,900
Just this tall.

472
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,130
To my waist.

473
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:25,780
Yes.

474
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,060
At that time,

475
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,610
we quarreled for three days and nights.

476
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,460
You and Lin didn’t want him to leave.

477
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,460
I still remember that very clearly.

478
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,180
We didn’t want that, of course.

479
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,060
Everyone knew

480
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,300
Wang Lin only wanted
to recover the former dynasty.

481
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,330
Later,

482
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:45,370
you and his Junior Master told me

483
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,370
if I didn’t let him go back,

484
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,610
he would be a mere villager

485
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,130
on Penglai Island

486
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,010
all his life.

487
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:55,610
Even when he died,

488
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,490
he would only think

489
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:00,610
this small island was the whole world.

490
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,850
His Junior Master loved him most.

491
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,210
But it was also him

492
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:08,060
who urged him to leave.

493
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:12,060
He said Anzhi couldn’t decide
where to live

494
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:15,180
before he had enough experience.

495
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,010
Could this be

496
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,370
his final destiny?

497
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,330
A generous man like him

498
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,010
would not stay

499
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:30,780
on Penglai Island

500
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,780
and grew old

501
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,300
with us.

502
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,700
It was his own choice.

503
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,700
It was also his fate.

504
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,660
Besides,

505
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,850
if he didn’t go,

506
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,090
he wouldn’t have met the girl

507
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,090
who is taking a great risk

508
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:50,010
to find the Fire Lotus for him.

509
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:53,660
Fei.

510
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,130
Be careful, Fei!

511
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,210
Fei.

512
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,780
I met that girl.

513
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,730
She’s faithful.

514
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,210
Anzhi has a good taste.

515
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,850
If Tongming is right,

516
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,250
the Fire Lotus should be
on the top of the snow peak.

517
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,370
I must get it.

518
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,700
He can’t wait for another decade.

519
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,820
Beautiful girl, long time no see.

520
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:37,370
We met hurriedly
at Demon-Extermination Assembly.

521
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:40,660
I lost you
before having a talk with you.

522
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,970
You left in such a hurry.

523
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:44,490
For what?

524
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,660
None of your business!

525
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,180
You killed Chu Tianyu.

526
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,180
Well done.

527
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:00,700
But you also took away
the Seal of Cautiousness

528
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,660
he snatched from me,

529
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,180
didn’t you?

530
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:05,460
If I hadn’t taken it,

531
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,180
would I leave it to you for fun?

532
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,850
It belongs to Mr. Huo.

533
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,130
Why did you snatch it?

534
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,250
Did you also believe

535
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,780
what Huo Liantao said

536
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,210
and want to find

537
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:22,490
the so-called treasure?

538
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,180
Phoenix Master.

539
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,090
If we fight now,

540
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,780
neither you nor I can get any benefit.

541
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,250
How about this?

542
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,780
Let me pick the Fire Lotus first.

543
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,210
Then I can let you punch me three times.

544
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:38,820
What do you think?

545
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,660
Funny.

546
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,370
Since when did I need you

547
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,010
to make a concession?

548
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,330
Don’t think I will show any mercy

549
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,850
just because you look beautiful.

550
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,180
The lotus has nine petals
which blossom every ten years.

551
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,700
When nine pedals blossom,

552
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,490
it’s the perfect time to pick the lotus.

553
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:08,850
You don’t want to wait
for another decade, huh?

554
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,660
Don’t touch it!

555
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,580
If you want it,

556
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,820
give me the Seal of Cautiousness.

557
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,580
What do you think you are?

558
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,420
How dare you ask
for the Seal of Cautiousness!

559
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,970
Don’t you want it?

560
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,130
Why don’t we cooperate

561
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:25,900
and get it from her?

562
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,700
You know what?

563
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,780
On the snow mountain,

564
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,490
no one can defeat me, Lu Tiankuang.

565
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,370
Snow Wolf Lu Tiankuang
with Demons Manor?

566
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,540
How are you doing?

567
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,460
Funny.

568
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,580
What do you do after you get the Seal?

569
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,210
Will you

570
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,370
cut it into halves?

571
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,660
Everyone with the Demons makes me sick.

572
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:11,970
Fire Lotus!

573
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:54,660
Fei.

574
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:56,850
Fei.

575
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,970
It’s been days and I miss you so much.

576
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,580
Why do you

577
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,730
look so haggard?

578
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:14,730
You woke up?

579
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,820
You really woke up?

580
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,250
Are you a bear?

581
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,210
Why are you wearing so much?

582
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,780
It’s cold.

583
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,460
I would be frozen
without so many clothes.

584
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:36,850
Oh,

585
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:37,820
where’s the Fire Lotus?

586
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,130
I...

587
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,660
I haven’t found it.

588
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,180
Fei.

589
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,330
Fei.

590
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,370
Anzhi!

591
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,730
Anzhi!

592
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,940
What did he just say?

593
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,900
Merciful Buddha.

594
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,060
How poor he is!

595
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:18,940
He can hardly enjoy love.

596
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,090
Fei.

597
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:21,900
Anzhi.

598
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,130
Fei.

599
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:23,780
Anzhi.

600
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,370
Since it’s our destiny,

601
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,180
we can’t change it.

602
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:37,940
I just want you

603
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:39,700
to be safe.

604
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,780
But I also told you.

605
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,330
No matter how far it is,

606
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,060
I will go anywhere

607
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,060
that all ordinary people can go

608
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,940
within the world.

609
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:56,370
Silly girl.

610
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,010
You’re so exhausted.

611
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,210
Is it worth your while?

612
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,370
Forget it.

613
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,820
Stop looking for the Fire Lotus.

614
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,850
Go back.

615
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,090
It’s worth my while.

616
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,420
Took up your blade
when you just woke up?

617
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,660
You’d like another fight?

618
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,260
Don’t worry.

619
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,850
I distinguish friends and enemies.

620
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,570
We just fought
against the enemy together.

621
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,700
I won’t fight you when you’re weak.

622
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,050
What’s this?

623
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:01,260
Dried muskrat.

624
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,420
I ate some

625
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,420
and dried the rest.

626
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:24,180
It’s lucky to have some meat now.

627
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,180
Eat it.

628
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,260
Or even if you were strong enough
to fight me now,

629
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,810
you couldn’t get
through the coming snowstorm.

630
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,290
May I have some more?

631
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:48,050
You’ve come around quickly.

632
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,940
I must survive.

633
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,290
You went up the snow mountain alone

634
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,850
and risked your life for the Fire Lotus.

635
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:07,740
Why do you value your life now?

636
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,050
I can’t die.

637
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:15,570
Someone is waiting for me.

638
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,700
I think,

639
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,420
you’re addicted to saving people.

640
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:24,130
Are their lives
more important than yours?

641
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,740
How impolite!

642
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,420
Their lives aren’t
more important than mine.

643
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,260
But...

644
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,180
Have you experienced such feelings

645
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,050
that you want to sacrifice everything,

646
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,570
just to make someone

647
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,330
talk to you again?

648
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,050
Why did you help me?

649
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,660
I thought you had great martial arts.

650
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,130
You must have practiced them

651
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,420
for many years.

652
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,810
If you died on the snow mountain
without a reason,

653
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,050
it would be a pity.

654
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:39,980
Everyone in this world

655
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,050
wants me to die early,

656
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,090
except you.

657
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:47,900
I’m afraid you’re the only one

658
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,940
who thinks my death would be a pity.

659
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,570
Well, you were the first martial master

660
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:56,610
I had met after I left home.

661
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,420
You sang the Crying beautifully.

662
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,370
Really?

663
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:05,180
Would you like to listen?

664
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:07,020
I’m afraid I’ll cry.

665
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,700
This is the former branch of Qi School.

666
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,900
You can leave me here.

667
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,850
Go back.

668
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,700
Li Sheng.

669
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,290
Shall we go with you

670
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,700
so that we can take care of each other?

671
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,090
This forest is set
according to Qi Men Dun Jia Formation.

672
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,940
Outsiders will get lost in it.

673
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:52,260
It was built to stop outsiders.

674
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,940
Mr. Chongxiao is a friend of mine.

675
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,050
But when I break in,

676
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,570
I’m already being impolite.

677
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,850
I can’t take anyone else in.

678
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,220
You can wait for me
at the secret service down the hill.

679
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,740
-Aye.
-Aye.

680
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:30,340
(Forbidden Forest)

681
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,500
Chongxiao, are you still alive?

682
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,330
Are you still making trouble
after you die?

683
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,330
Still making trouble?

684
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,020
The formation again?

685
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:00,220
When I was little, my father forced me

686
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,610
to recite it so many times.

687
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:03,610
Why can’t I ever remember?

688
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,370
What Qian, three Yang...

689
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,290
Kun, six Yin.

690
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:13,180
Zhen...

691
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,180
Zhen what?

692
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:18,980
Qian, three Yang.

693
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:23,370
Kun, six Yin.

694
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:27,290
Zhen...

695
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,260
Zhen, six Yin on the top!

696
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,610
Zhen, six Yin on the top!

697
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:42,370
(Forbidden Forest)

698
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,500
Zhen, six Yin on the top!

699
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,530
I made it!

700
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:50,940
(Forbidden Forest)

701
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:58,180
Con...

702
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,610
Congratulations, Lord.

703
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:03,330
Congratulations, Lord.

704
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,330
Congratulations, Lord.

705
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,260
You’ve...

706
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:11,090
You’ve...

707
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:12,420
You’ve got better martial arts.

708
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,770
You saw that map, didn’t you?

709
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:20,330
Lord, I... I did see it.

710
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,290
With... With a glance.

711
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,370
There were a few lines on it.

712
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:26,900
They looked standardized,

713
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,530
like a poem.

714
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,700
What poem?

715
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:33,370
Looks...

716
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:34,740
Looks like...

717
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,020
Looks like words...

718
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,770
Something like

719
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:41,220
birds, women, martial...

720
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,740
Stones...

721
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:45,700
What else?

722
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,130
All right. All right.

723
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,980
What else is on the map?

724
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,610
Else...

725
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:52,740
What else...?

726
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,020
Some...

727
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,290
Some things are on it.

728
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,610
What are they?

729
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,290
They are...

730
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:02,050
Uh...

731
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:03,660
There’s a...

732
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,090
a gold bracelet.

733
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,020
Yes, Lord.

734
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,370
The bracelet
in the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

735
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:11,610
And there’s a longevity lock.

736
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:12,570
A scab...

737
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:13,700
Scabbard.

738
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,260
And...

739
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:15,940
A seal.

740
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:16,850
Yes. Yes.

741
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:17,980
A seal...

742
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:20,220
No. No.

743
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,020
Lord.

744
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:21,900
What else?

745
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:22,500
And...

746
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,810
And...

747
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:24,740
Uh...

748
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,370
A wh...

749
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:26,050
Whisk!

750
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,020
Yes, Lord.

751
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:29,610
A barren whisk.

752
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,420
Whisk?

753
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,940
Sure enough,

754
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,460
Chongxiao was also involved.

755
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:44,940
Ask Gu Tianxian

756
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:47,130
to keep a close eye on Chongxiao.

757
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,050
Aye!

758
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:54,850
Lord.

759
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:58,130
I know you questioned me

760
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:01,220
so that I could make amends
for my failure.

761
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:02,820
Get out!

762
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,500
Go lock yourself

763
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,660
and think about what else is on the map.

764
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:10,850
Draw everything out!

765
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:11,930
Get out!

766
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,020
Draw? Draw?

767
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,530
I’ll draw it. I will.
