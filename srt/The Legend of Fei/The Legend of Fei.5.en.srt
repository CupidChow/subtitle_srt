17
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,050
I’m going to save them.

18
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,190
Wait.

19
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,720
So many martial artists are locked here.

20
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,710
How can you save them?

21
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,850
Simple. Get them all out.

22
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,120
Young lady,

23
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,720
the situation is complicated
and dangerous.

24
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,690
There isn’t much you can do

25
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,980
on your own.

26
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,330
Well,

27
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,140
I can tell you about the layout

28
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,230
and the posts.

29
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,760
How did you know all that?

30
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,240
You think I’d wait to rot in here?

31
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,920
This lock couldn’t stop me.

32
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,300
I’ve gone out more than once.

33
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,320
If so,

34
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,510
why didn’t you help others?

35
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,690
Have you forgotten

36
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,210
I’m poisoned?

37
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,400
I mean,

38
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,580
how could I rescue others?

39
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,050
Look, we’re in a two-story

40
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,330
heavily guarded dungeon.

41
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:52,910
If you

42
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,470
can make it here,

43
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,260
you’ll be able to get out.

44
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,120
Got it?

45
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,600
Weed Spirit! Weed Spirit!

46
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,630
Weed Spirit!

47
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,490
How did you get in?

48
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:45,930
Am I good?

49
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,010
Open it!

50
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,060
The routes you drew are too messy.

51
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,630
I can’t see them clearly.

52
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,000
Miss,

53
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,000
can you read a map or not?

54
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,400
It’s about time.

55
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,260
Hurry up.

56
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,430
Be quiet!

57
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,450
This dungeon is filled

58
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,450
with prisoners from top to bottom.

59
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,780
Guards change shifts every two hours

60
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,920
when the clapper sounds.

61
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,450
I see.

62
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,120
By the way,

63
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,140
if you run into

64
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,000
someone in red,

65
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,140
just leave immediately.

66
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:08,910
Do not hesitate.

67
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,220
Those old fogies

68
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,100
have been to hell and back.

69
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,930
They’ll sure get themselves out.

70
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,530
Stay out of trouble.

71
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,960
Just go home

72
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,170
and tell your seniors

73
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,340
to ask the Huo’s for your people.

74
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:24,750
Don’t worry.

75
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,370
At this point,

76
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,820
Huo Liantao wouldn’t say no
to your leader.

77
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,960
He’ll certainly

78
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,500
release Chenfei.

79
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,790
Then what?

80
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,370
What about you?

81
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,880
Last night, the stars showed

82
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,140
chaos would soon rise.

83
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,920
Just pretend you don’t know anything.

84
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,340
Find the ones you’re looking for

85
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,570
and leave.

86
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,100
Why are you staring at me?

87
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,040
I have principles.

88
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,780
I’d never ask a girl

89
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,970
to take any risks.

90
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,640
I enjoy staying here.

91
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,510
The three of us are having fun.

92
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,510
I can stay for two more months
without feeling lonely.

93
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,820
Why is there the three of you?

94
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,890
The blazing sun,

95
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,220
the clear sky,

96
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,450
and me.

97
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,030
Are you sure it’s not
stone, sand and you?

98
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,360
You’re too sick

99
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,340
to be cured

100
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:48,960
I guess.

101
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,730
Hey.

102
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,360
Once

103
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,920
I’m out

104
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,490
and you aren’t home yet,

105
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,790
I’ll join you.

106
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,330
There’s something important
that you should have.

107
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:17,880
Last time,

108
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,370
although I was ordered

109
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,120
to break into your place,

110
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,770
your parents were
separated because of me.

111
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,510
And your blade was broken, too.

112
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,160
I’m surprised you still remember that.

113
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,300
It’s always been on my mind

114
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,140
and I’m planning to make you a new one.

115
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,750
But

116
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,990
the materials are still lacking.

117
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,130
So

118
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,630
I can only give you
a wooden one for now.

119
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,830
The real one has to wait.

120
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,320
Are you...

121
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,930
Are you not leaving with me?

122
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,370
The two of us will make a bigger target.

123
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,020
The guards have already been alerted

124
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,020
when you came in.

125
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,120
They’re after you as we speak.

126
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,010
Relax.

127
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,100
I’m blessed.

128
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:31,940
You should

129
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,570
leave without me.

130
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,960
At least, you can be the messenger.

131
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,460
You can’t die

132
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,740
before paying off your debts.

133
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,550
I know.

134
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,260
I wasn’t taught to be a deserter.

135
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,800
How could I go back

136
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,800
without finding them?

137
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,890
Besides...

138
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,630
I didn’t expect to see her here.

139
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,230
That girl is

140
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,230
a real troublemaker.

141
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,260
Is she out yet?

142
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,420
Let’s go.

143
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,860
OK. Coming.

144
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,830
Guards change shifts every two hours

145
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:45,780
when the clapper sounds.

146
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,940
At that time,

147
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,350
guards of the first shift
will pass by the pavilion and leave.

148
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,540
Is there anything wrong?

149
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,170
No.

150
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,160
Their replacements

151
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,230
will patrol around briefly.

152
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,120
At that moment,

153
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,150
the post will be left empty.

154
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,840
You can go there.

155
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,550
If they see me,

156
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,210
I’ll fight my way out.

157
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,590
Let’s go.

158
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,010
Come on.

159
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,240
Coming.

160
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,380
There might be antidotes here.

161
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,410
Those bastards

162
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,620
are treating themselves so well

163
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,480
while feeding others poison.

164
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,960
Take that way to search.

165
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,300
Go.

166
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:33,810
Go over there.

167
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,000
Let’s go.

168
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,450
That’s a strong force.

169
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,850
He looks

170
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,740
weaker than Father.

171
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,740
Thank you.

172
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,580
Sir...

173
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:07,920
are you...

174
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,260
are you alright?

175
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,840
Who are you?

176
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,860
What are you doing here?

177
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,360
You’re the one

178
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,360
they’re looking for, aren’t you?

179
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,110
One of my cousins

180
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,990
was caught

181
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,250
on an outing.

182
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,220
I’m here to look for him.

183
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,220
Sorry for disturbing you.

184
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,750
Who taught you your skills?

185
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,620
They were created by my ancestors.

186
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,860
My parents and I

187
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,070
don’t take them too seriously.

188
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,130
I only practice them for health.

189
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,150
And our family is small

190
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,640
even with two more cousins,

191
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,410
unlike those prestigious sects.

192
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,380
Sir,

193
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,980
are you sick?

194
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,700
My...

195
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,510
My father is just like you.

196
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,650
He’s in poor condition.

197
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,300
A little cold

198
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:27,880
could make him cough all day.

199
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,330
I wonder

200
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,980
if he’s taken

201
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,420
good care of.

202
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,300
I’m fine.

203
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,890
I’ve had it for years.

204
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,650
Sir,

205
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,350
I took this from the post.

206
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,200
It’s for those guards

207
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,110
and isn’t poisoned.

208
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,180
They drug

209
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,710
your food

210
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,540
every day.

211
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,390
It’ll worsen your condition.

212
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,160
You are already in poor health.

213
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,840
Try to eat their food
as little as possible.

214
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,160
Do you know

215
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,970
where your cousin is kept?

216
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,530
No.

217
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,400
And you still came regardless?

218
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,870
Don’t you know who owns this place?

219
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,650
I don’t.

220
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,690
Have you heard of
the Four-guardian Mountain?

221
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,220
What do you think

222
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,620
an ignorant kid like you can do?

223
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,730
Your family must be desperate.

224
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,740
Who is he?

225
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,660
He’s old

226
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,150
and mean.

227
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,020
Four-guardian Mountain

228
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,930
was home to the evil

229
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,090
headed by four leaders,

230
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,650
claiming to be
the Four Guardians of the World.

231
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,120
Truth is,

232
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,250
they were a bunch of notorious villains,

233
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:57,700
who threw the world into turmoil.

234
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,860
Later, internal strife appeared

235
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,280
when they came at each other

236
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,540
and they disbanded.

237
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,700
In the end,

238
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,270
Phoenix and his followers

239
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,840
settled down in Jingzhou

240
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,390
and attached themselves to the Huo’s.

241
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,050
Phoenix,

242
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,680
Mu Xiaoqiao,

243
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:25,140
once defeated

244
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,140
three top masters of the Mount Tai Sect

245
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,070
within half an hour

246
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,960
and left safely under everyone’s watch.

247
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,900
He sounds like a real piece of work.

248
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,180
I must be careful.

249
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,490
Why don’t I go get the antidotes first?

250
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,890
You see what you got yourself into?

251
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,280
You won’t always be this lucky.

252
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,070
Get lost.

253
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,560
Thank you.

254
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,730
The kitchen.

255
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,130
The food must be poisoned

256
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,360
in the kitchen

257
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,190
where people come and go.

258
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,610
Their own people might

259
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,080
take the poisoned food by mistake.

260
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,890
So they must have the antidotes.

261
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,780
That chef

262
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,990
may lead me to them.

263
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,770
Lord,

264
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,180
just now...

265
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,810
That’s alright.

266
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,240
It won’t

267
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,380
affect anything.

268
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,170
Are you sure Phoenix is here?

269
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,430
Yes.

270
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,940
Good.

271
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,080
My time is worth it.

272
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,780
Stick to the plan.

273
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,450
Once Tong Tianyang arrives,

274
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,270
kill Mu Xiaoqiao first.

275
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,230
Huo Liantao is nothing.

276
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,090
Seize him

277
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,180
and make him talk.

278
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,160
Yes.

279
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,140
Hold on.

280
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,580
If you happen to

281
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,380
see that girl,

282
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,050
don’t kill her.

283
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,700
Look what I’ve found!

284
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,620
Didn’t I ask you to leave?

285
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,850
Why are you back again?

286
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,390
Open it.

287
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,060
Come in.

288
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,830
I don’t know what they are.

289
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:30,830
Have a look.

290
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,170
This is...

291
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,040
the Heat-proof Pill.

292
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,270
Kill-all Poison.

293
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,700
Styptic Powder.

294
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,360
What’s this?

295
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,420
Arsenic.

296
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,160
None of them is the antidote.

297
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,090
What’s this?

298
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,510
Aphrodi...

299
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,430
Where did you get all these?

300
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,600
Did you empty their stash?

301
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,380
What’s the last one?

302
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:09,550
Uh...

303
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,180
Well...

304
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,240
That’s...

305
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,730
a kind of sauce.

306
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:14,770
You don’t need to know.

307
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,210
Not this one.

308
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,110
It’s not any of them.

309
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,950
Where could the antidotes be?

310
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,340
Does Mu Xiaoqiao take them with him?

311
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,840
Who told you about him?

312
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,110
Bad news! Bad news!

313
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,340
Someone broke in.

314
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,850
Who else is here?

315
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,390
Go!

316
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,030
Bad news! Bad news!

317
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:47,740
What happened?

318
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,920
Is Fortress of the Forty-Eight here?

319
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,770
No, it’s worse.

320
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:51,570
It’s the Demons.

321
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,430
They’re right outside.

322
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,990
We’re asked to battle them.

323
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,050
Let’s go!

324
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:55,810
Go!

325
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,580
Oh, no!

326
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,160
The situation is worse than I thought.

327
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,090
Where should we go?

328
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,590
Go against the crowd.

329
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,540
Mu Xiaoqiao must be out battling them.

330
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,970
Let’s go to his room.

331
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:19,720
Let’s go.

332
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,510
This way.

333
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,200
Other than people of
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight,

334
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,610
those of the Demons Manor sneaked in

335
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,020
right under your nose, too.

336
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,190
What else could you do?

337
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,280
Who is it?

338
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,480
Report!

339
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,070
Phoenix asked me

340
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,740
to fetch that thing in his room.

341
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,710
Go ahead.

342
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,440
Yes.

343
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,460
Found it.

344
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,180
Is this the antidote?

345
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,110
How much should one take?

346
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,840
Smelling it is enough.

347
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,470
Too much of it is lethal.

348
00:22:59,310 --> 00:22:59,860
Let’s go!

349
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,100
Hold on.

350
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,110
What’s that?

351
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:24,600
Oh, no!

352
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,600
They’re going to blow up this place.

353
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,540
Help! Somebody help!

354
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,090
Help! Let us out!

355
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:45,920
Help!

356
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,700
Help!

357
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,400
This is the antidote.

358
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:53,940
Thank you.

359
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,960
Smell it.

360
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,850
Come out.

361
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,540
Hurry up and leave

362
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,520
as soon as possible!

363
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,740
Let’s go!

364
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,260
Where are you going?

365
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,060
Li Sheng and Chenfei

366
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,880
aren’t here.

367
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,900
I need to find them.

368
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,980
Over there.

369
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,800
This way.

370
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,570
Go, go, go!

371
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,350
Hurry!

372
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,850
Let’s go!

373
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,620
-Come on.
-Let’s go.

374
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,510
This way.

375
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,930
Let’s go. Hurry up!

376
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:37,880
Go!

377
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,210
This way.

378
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:42,940
Don’t worry.

379
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,320
Judging by your cousin’s look,

380
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,290
he still has many years to live.

381
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,290
Even if he’s got the look,

382
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,290
if Phoenix captures him,

383
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,470
he’ll be...

384
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,360
Huo Liantao!

385
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,380
This way.

386
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,590
-It’s him!
-It’s him!

387
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,020
Huo Liantao, you bastard!

388
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,020
Come out now!

389
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,320
You know him?

390
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,200
We met before.

391
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,460
Demons may

392
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,460
kill everyone

393
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,410
in this place,

394
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,990
including us.

395
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,910
Just leave

396
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:53,690
when you still can.

397
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,560
This way.

398
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,070
Why are you following me?

399
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,640
If you won’t leave,

400
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,220
then take the antidote

401
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,570
to those deadbeats.

402
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,470
I’m off.

403
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,350
Sure.

404
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,110
Give it to me.

405
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,820
Seriously,

406
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,340
do you know what’s happening?

407
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,200
Demons and Phoenix are all here.

408
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,020
Do you want to die?

409
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,110
I can’t abandon Li Sheng

410
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,360
and Chenfei.

411
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,920
If I leave

412
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,810
without them,

413
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,930
my mother will kill me.

414
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,930
I’ve made a promise.

415
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,480
Hey,

416
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,480
is she really your mother?

417
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,790
Does some promise weigh more
than your life?

418
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,860
Yes!

419
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:48,950
You’re right.

420
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,780
A promise should be kept.

421
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,000
No one’s life

422
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,720
is more valuable than others’.

423
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,390
Let’s go

424
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,000
and get all those poor bastards

425
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,900
out of jail.

426
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,630
The rest is up to heaven.

427
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:02,970
And we won’t have any regrets.

428
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,250
You’ve finally manned up for once.

429
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,620
Who’d know a long-legged

430
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,890
heartthrob like me

431
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,590
would make friends with a dwarf?

432
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,550
What are the odds?

433
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,030
Why am I a dwarf?

434
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,540
You aren’t even as tall

435
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,060
as my legs, shorty.

436
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,610
Master.

437
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,890
Where’s Phoenix?

438
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,650
There’s no sign of him.

439
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,030
He’s here.

440
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,180
Phoenix?

441
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,310
No, Tong Tianyang of the Demons Manor.

442
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:48,900
Who is he here for?

443
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,010
For you.

444
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,780
Our plan is doomed to fail.

445
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,960
We need to find a shelter first.

446
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,690
Let’s go!

447
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,390
Come here.

448
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,010
This is the antidote.

449
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:04,690
Smell it.

450
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:05,220
Thanks.

451
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,270
The back door is at the end
on the left.

452
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:06,860
Go.

453
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,100
Let’s go!

454
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,890
The back door is at the end on the left.

455
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:10,510
Go.

456
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,280
Here is filled with kerosene. Get out.

457
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,450
Smell the antidote.

458
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,120
The back door is at the end
on the left. Go.

459
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:20,590
Yes.

460
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,060
Relax.

461
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,910
I’ll protect your people.

462
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:26,650
Thanks.

463
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,590
Please wait.

464
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:32,580
Thank you for saving my life.

465
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,610
May I know your names?

466
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,340
Two nobodies.

467
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,310
No need to thank us.

468
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,020
Fine.

469
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,190
I’m in debt to you

470
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,710
for saving me

471
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,090
and I’ll pay you back in the future.

472
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:44,840
Sir,

473
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,570
didn’t you hear what I said?

474
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,010
This place could explode anytime.

475
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,900
I’m off.

476
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,880
Huo Liantao,

477
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,750
where do you think you’re going?

478
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,520
Hand over the Seal of Cautiousness.

479
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,250
What are you talking about?

480
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,440
I have no idea.

481
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,190
Really?

482
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,300
Are you aware of the ripple pattern?

483
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,040
No.

484
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,020
-Here’s the antidote.
-Thanks.

485
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,110
Smell it.

486
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,630
Follow the others. Here you are.

487
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:31,960
-Here.
-Alright.

488
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,960
Watch out!

489
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,620
Are you sneaking up on me?

490
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,570
Shame on you!

491
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,800
We’re here

492
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,290
for members of the Huo’s Manor only.

493
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:51,430
Get out

494
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,180
if you are not!

495
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,110
Let’s go. Run!

496
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:01,780
Nice!

497
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,500
Fei,

498
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,080
kill him!

499
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:03,760
Zip it!

500
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,200
Smell the antidote.

501
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:22,780
I almost forgot.

502
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,190
Let me get you out.

503
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:31,490
Miss,

504
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,960
the key to mastering all martial arts

505
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,130
is the same,

506
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,130
that is, how well
you control the strength.

507
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,330
Precision leads to perfection.

508
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:42,610
Or however strong or skilled you are,

509
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,270
you can only achieve so much

510
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,890
on the wrong path.

511
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,390
That’s right!

512
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,860
She isn’t a master

513
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,120
but she has what it takes

514
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,610
to become one.

515
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,900
Young man,

516
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,260
you have a knack

517
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,260
for flattery.

518
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:22,980
Thank you for your teaching.

519
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,530
Thank you for your antidote.

520
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,360
Fei, is it you?

521
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,800
Fei! Fei!

522
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,310
What are you doing here?

523
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,100
Chenfei.

524
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,310
Did leader know?

525
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,310
Chenfei, have you seen Li Sheng?

526
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,460
No.

527
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,350
Never mind.

528
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,730
He’d only be a burden.

529
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:43,850
Let’s go.

530
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,120
Miss Wu,

531
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,090
let’s go.

532
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,580
The antidote.

533
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,450
Oh,

534
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,430
here’s the antidote.

535
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,490
Thanks.

536
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,250
Miss Wu, smell the antidote.

537
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,430
Don’t be afraid.

538
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,190
Fei and I are of the same sect.

539
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,850
They’re General Wu’s family,

540
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,420
Miss Wu

541
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:16,500
and Mr. Wu.

542
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:17,930
Miss Wu,

543
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,390
here’s dangerous. We should leave.

544
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,690
Thank you, Fei.

545
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,640
Others are kept over there.

546
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,530
Give me a hand.

547
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,410
Fei,

548
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,090
aren’t you afraid?

549
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,940
What’s there to be afraid?

550
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,490
I’ll level this mountain

551
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,960
in ten years.

552
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,920
Go.

553
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,280
Smell the antidote.

554
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,140
That...

555
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,860
♪Whereabouts is nowhere to find♪

556
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:50,760
Listen carefully.

557
00:32:50,783 --> 00:32:59,435
♪Whereabouts is nowhere to find♪

558
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:14,740
♪Rouge is tainted red by rainwater♪

559
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,170
What’s that?

560
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,620
Crying.

561
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,420
♪Tears roll down in loneliness♪

562
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,200
And that is?

563
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,730
A song

564
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,730
telling how a beauty

565
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,380
was abandoned by love before youth.

566
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,440
Tears streamed down

567
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,910
and smeared

568
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,220
her makeup.

569
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,030
I don’t understand a word.

570
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,890
That’s Phoenix,

571
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,910
Mu Xiaoqiao.

572
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,930
To what do I owe this honor, Lord Shen?

573
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,420
(Mu Xiaoqiao Four-guardian Mountain Phoenix)

574
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,630
(Mu Xiaoqiao Four-guardian Mountain Phoenix)
Why didn’t you give me a heads-up

575
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,890
so that I could receive you properly?

576
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:09,470
I apologize for my intrusion.

577
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,690
How have you been, Phoenix?

578
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,130
I rose from a nobody,

579
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,130
struggling so hard

580
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,030
only to make a living.

581
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:27,160
I don’t think I owe you.

582
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,160
If you need anything,

583
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,790
feel free to tell me.

584
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,590
Why go to

585
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,050
such great lengths?

586
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,680
I do need a favor.

587
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,410
I’m all ears.

588
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:43,810
Do you mind ruining
your meridian channels

589
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:45,590
and cut off your hand?

590
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,440
I don’t think

591
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,410
you need a third hand,

592
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:07,970
Lord Shen.

593
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,200
What will come will come.

594
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,400
Let’s see

595
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,880
what you’ve got.

596
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,710
It’s... it’s him!

597
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,710
You know him, too?

598
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,600
When I was looking for the antidote,

599
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,760
he...

600
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,930
gave me a few instructions.

601
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,350
I underestimated you.

602
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,810
I’m surprised

603
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:13,150
that Shen Tianshu
of Demons Manor instructed you.

604
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,210
No one else

605
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,200
in the world

606
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,610
has had such an honor.

607
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,900
He’s a Demon, too?

608
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,820
Yes,

609
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,000
the top one, to be accurate.

610
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:24,020
The Square Walk is his signature.

611
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,390
But I heard

612
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:27,810
he’s stuck at
the ninth level for long.

613
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,510
Let’s go.

614
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,730
Let’s go.

615
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,900
(Kerosene)

616
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,190
Huo Liantao!

617
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,870
Huo Liantao, this isn’t over!

618
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,870
Lord,

619
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,870
Huo Liantao has lit the kerosene.

620
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,100
We must go.

621
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:41,620
Let’s go.

622
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,350
What’s wrong?

623
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,340
You guys go ahead.

624
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,670
I’ll take care of them.

625
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,890
Fei!

626
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:57,930
Alright.

627
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:59,680
I’ll help you.

628
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,490
Be careful.

629
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,990
-Let’s go.
-Sure.

630
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:16,970
Miss,

631
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:17,750
three to the north,

632
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,000
block the path.

633
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,600
What?

634
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,250
See that stone?

635
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,590
Lean against it.

636
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:27,140
One to the left.

637
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,310
Attack his feet.

638
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,280
To the south.

639
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,040
Kick.

640
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,200
You must be

641
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,100
from the Qi School.

642
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,300
(Chongxiaozi Qi School)

643
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,240
Greetings.

644
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,820
This is called the Mayfly Formation

645
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:43,810
which requires only one person,

646
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,960
especially he or she is outnumbered.

647
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,970
Miss,

648
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,480
two steps forward,

649
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,770
one more to the left.

650
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,890
My mother gave it to me before I left.

651
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,530
It’s broken.

652
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,400
Don’t be upset.

653
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,670
I’ll get you a new one.

654
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:24,310
Let’s go.

655
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,750
I know a shortcut.

656
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,150
Come on.

657
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:36,080
Let’s go.

658
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,050
This way.

659
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:38,480
Thank you.

660
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:38,870
Let’s go!

661
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:39,840
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

662
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,920
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

663
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,200
Let’s go.

664
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,480
This way.

665
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,180
(Kerosene)

666
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,510
Oh, no, explosion!

667
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,590
Many have escaped.

668
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,730
Let’s go.

669
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:43,740
Yes.

670
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:57,610
Split up into two groups.

671
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,510
One goes in to search.

672
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,250
You lead the other one.

673
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,820
(Yu Wenzhi)

674
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,840
The Wu’s

675
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,740
are likely to be in the crowd.

676
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,550
We cannot let them go.

677
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,010
Yes.

678
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:18,540
Li Sheng! Li Sheng! Li Sheng!

679
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,960
Mrs. Wang.

680
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,180
Where’s Sheng?

681
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:38,290
-Sheng! Sheng! Sheng!
-Li Sheng!

682
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:39,660
Sheng!

683
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,690
-Sheng!
-Li Sheng!

684
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:41,490
Li Sheng!

685
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:43,750
-Sheng!
-Li Sheng!

686
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,980
-Mrs. Wang.
-Li Sheng!

687
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,040
Fei.

688
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,740
Chenfei.

689
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:54,900
Are you alright?

690
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:56,910
Good.

691
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,910
Let’s get out of here,

692
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,290
or those three killing machines

693
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:01,800
will catch up with us.

694
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,420
I agree.

695
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:05,900
We’re finally out of the valley,

696
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,060
but here is

697
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,000
still not safe.

698
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:10,950
How about this?

699
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,020
Sirs, can you...

700
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,050
Chenfei is fine.

701
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,190
Sure.

702
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:22,070
It’s Mu Xiaoqiao.

703
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:22,860
Chenfei.

704
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:23,860
Please

705
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,340
escort the injured
and the others to leave

706
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,010
with your members.

707
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,710
I’ll cover you

708
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,680
and try to stall them.

709
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:31,590
I’ll join you.

710
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,190
You?

711
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,790
We make a great team.

712
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:37,900
Together

713
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,700
we can buy them more time.

714
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:44,280
No.

715
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:45,700
I’ll stay.

716
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,340
You need to protect the others.

717
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,840
We each have our own responsibility.

718
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,670
And my skills

719
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,220
have improved greatly.

720
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,190
You’ve grown up.

721
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:00,960
Listen,

722
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:02,380
be careful

723
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,790
and come back safe and sound.

724
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:06,780
Don’t worry, Chenfei.

725
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,520
I won’t allow

726
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,200
anything to happen to her.

727
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:20,500
Who’s the jinx between us?

728
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:21,960
Every time we met,

729
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,130
we’d be in danger.

730
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,330
But we survived every time, didn’t we?

731
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:39,990
I hope

732
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:41,790
we will survive again.

733
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:49,330
Hey,

734
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,330
it’s you.

735
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:54,050
You’re

736
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:55,830
in luck

737
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:58,920
that you’ve managed to get out.

738
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:01,800
I wouldn’t

739
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,960
call this luck

740
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,680
that we encountered you.

741
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,450
That girl isn’t too bad.

742
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,240
What a shame!

743
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:20,820
Those who got out of the dungeon

744
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:25,550
must...

745
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,170
die.

746
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,080
Wait!

747
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,330
This is a misunderstanding.

748
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:38,440
We’ve never meant to challenge you.

749
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:40,550
If we fight against each other,

750
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:41,790
neither of us will win

751
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:43,560
other than those Demons.

752
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:46,350
You two battling me?

753
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,010
You’re

754
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,420
so full of yourself!

755
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,420
Mu Xiaoqiao,

756
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:54,810
you sang

757
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:55,970
the song wrong.

758
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,330
Excuse me?

759
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,180
You know that song, too?

760
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,410
Back in the dungeon,

761
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:10,470
I once heard you sing

762
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,240
“winter comes at home”.

763
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:15,510
It should be

764
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:17,030
“winter comes again at home”.

765
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:20,560
By deleting that word,

766
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,880
the feelings have completely changed

767
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,250
from sorrowful to shallow.

768
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:28,630
“Winter comes at home”.

769
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:34,240
“Winter comes again at home”.

770
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,060
No wonder

771
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,370
I always find something

772
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:43,620
is missing.

773
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:44,810
Turns out...

774
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:59,060

00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:03,740
