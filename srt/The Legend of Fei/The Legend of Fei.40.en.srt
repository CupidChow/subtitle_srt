No one is here. Go.

Who are they?

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,560
I’m sorry. I’m sorry!

00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,780
-Enough.
-I’m sorry!

24
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,670
Mr. Yin.

25
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,160
I know

26
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,400
you can only pass the Manual
to your descendants.

27
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,880
Yin Pei has gone the evil way.

28
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,910
If I keep it here,

29
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,160
there will be a reign of terror again.

00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,960
Many innocent people will die.

31
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,600
So, I’ve decided

32
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,350
to burn it.

33
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,830
Mr. Yin, hope you can understand me

34
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,800
in heaven.

35
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,990
You?

36
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,680
You want to offer a sacrifice
to my father, don’t you?

37
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,820
Let me take you there.

38
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,190
Why hasn’t Miss Wu come yet?

39
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,190
I’ll ask someone to get her.

40
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,070
Don’t bother.

41
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,580
I’ll go. We’ll come later.

42
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,520
Chuchu?

43
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,350
Xie Meimei has gone
to buy some food.

44
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,270
Why hasn’t he been back?

45
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,350

50
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,870
How did you know

51
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,840
when I would use the other hand?

52
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,880
I guessed it.

53
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,240
I had good luck, I guess.

54
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,240
You use your blade
in a different way as Li Zheng.

55
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,460
I’m surely weaker than my grandfather.

56
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,410
Li Zheng used the blade perfectly.

57
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,720
He took advantage of all martial arts,

58
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,190
and used his blade in a just way.

59
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,190
When I met him,

60
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,870
he didn’t have grave
or all-embracing killing intent

61
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,990
like you do.

62
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,350
Speaking of martial arts,

63
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,680
you’re inferior to him.

64
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,000
But if he were alive,

65
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,630
he might not defeat you

66
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,630
when you fought.

67
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,960
Phoenix, long time no see.

68
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,600
Spare those compliments.

69
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,960
What do you want?

70
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,070
I’ve killed

71
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,910
Pathetic Clam.

72
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,820
(Master Huo Changfeng)

73
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,150
Get out, all of you!

74
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,870
I’ll sing the opera for him only.

75
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,240
Get out, all of you!

76
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,130
You put the poison in the candle.

77
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,270
That was good.

78
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,690
Are you Pathetic Clam with the Demons?

79
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,400
I’ve heard a lot about you.

80
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,520
You use the poison perfectly.

81
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,280
And you pretend very well.

82
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,400
I came to give back
the Seal of Cautiousness,

83
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,470
and raised a colossal uproar in town

84
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,840
just to attract you

85
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,750
who seldom come out.

86
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,400
Phoenix, I really admire you.

87
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,440
You live up to your reputation.

88
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,400
Well, let me tell you.

89
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,070
I poisoned

90
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,350
Old Master Huo.

91
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,350
Unfortunately, my Worry-burying Flower
wasn’t in full blossom

92
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,030
and it wasn’t the most poisonous.

93
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,520
He failed to die immediately.

94
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,630
But he still became a fool
and got paralyzed in bed.

95
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,910
You did that!

96
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,440
It was really you!

97
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,280
Don’t you want to know

98
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,910
what Old Master Huo said
before he was poisoned?

99
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,680
What poison did you use?

100
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,630
Why is it so toxic?

101
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,590
That’s exactly what he said
before he was poisoned.

102
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,870
You were good friends, weren’t you?

103
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,240
I’ll kill you with the same poison.

104
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,440
Then you can die with him.

105
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,440
Even if I have to die,

106
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,390
I’ll take you with me!

107
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,200
Let me remind you.

108
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,640
You can’t use your force rashly.

109
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,950
Otherwise,

110
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,910
you will die sooner.

111
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,080
She didn’t take away the Seal.

112
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,240
Pretty girl, do you want it?

113
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,440
Why do you want to give it to me?

114
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,620
Qi School has disappeared.

115
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,350
The Huo family has no descendants.

116
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,510
Yin Wenlan’s son is great.

117
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,880
He has made himself in a mess.

118
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,390
Only the Li family has

119
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,070
some heirs.

120
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,770
But I’m with the Zhou family.

121
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,800
You always wanted to get

122
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,680
the Seal of Cautiousness, didn’t you?

123
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,640
Why do you suddenly want
to give it to me?

124
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,710
You were wounded?

125
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,320
To kill the craftiest Pathetic Clam,

126
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,350
I had to pay some price.

127
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,560
Anyway,

128
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,150
you will take care

129
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,950
of the Seal of Cautiousness.

130
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,560
What do you want me to do for you?

131
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,710
All you need to do

132
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,240
is to keep the Seal carefully.

133
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,240
I was poisoned.

134
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,710
I know I will die.

135
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,470
But fortunately,

136
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,830
I’ve avenged Mr. Huo.

137
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,320
I can stay with him in heaven
without concern.

138
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,150
On the snow mountain,

139
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,990
you said you would save
an important friend.

140
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,760
It’s said

141
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,730
that the Phoenix Pill reappeared.

142
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,270
It may help your friend.

143
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,470
What is the Phoenix Pill?

144
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:43,080
It’s said that,

145
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,510
when someone takes it

146
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,680
and digests it with strong force,

147
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,510
he will come back to life

148
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,950
and make a thoroughgoing change.

149
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,350
But if taking the Phoenix Pill directly,

150
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:57,880
he will easily go wrong

151
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,890
or even die of explosion.

152
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,760
Chongxiao was out of his mind.

153
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,510
He left the pills before he died.

154
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,240
If you tell me

155
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,150
the Phoenix Pill can relieve a cough,
improve blood circulation

156
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,150
or even nourish kidney,

157
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,710
I may believe you.

158
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:22,200
But you said it would make people
come back to life.

159
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
That sounds ridiculous.

160
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,240
It’s obviously nonsense.

161
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,560
If it weren’t banned drug
to make people come back to life,

162
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,760
why would Qi School hide it

163
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,340
instead of telling others?

164
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:37,900
You’re right.

165
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,560
Yin Pei improved
his martial arts greatly

166
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,270
after taking the Phoenix Pill

167
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,820
and killed people everywhere.

168
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,080
Maybe,

169
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,200
it can really help Xie Yun.

170
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,200
In this world there are terrible men

171
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,660
who do stupid things.

172
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,700
But you.

173
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,350
You look beautiful

174
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,630
and you have good martial arts.

175
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,700
When I leave the Seal to you,

176
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,900
Mr. Huo will feel relieved

177
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,670
if he knows it in heaven.

178
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,840
He’ll think I’ve done a good thing.

179
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,270
I lived my life willfully,

180
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,440
regardless of my reputation.

181
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,850
I left Huo’s Manor in a fit of pique.

182
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,680
I didn’t know
I would get Mr. Huo killed.

183
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,640
He spent the rest of his life

184
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,330
keeping the secret
of the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

185
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,640
We argued about it for twenty years.

186
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,320
I owed him a life.

187
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,440
Time to pay him back.

188
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,470
Lord, you took a great risk.

189
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,640
If the powder hadn’t been on her face

190
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,800
and Mu Xiaoqiao had seen
through the substitute,

191
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,680
he would come back to you again.

192
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,490
She’s a woman of sacrifice
I trained for years.

193
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,480
She was very efficient.

194
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,900
Nothing would go wrong.

195
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,920
Commander-in-chief asked me
to get the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

196
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,560
If I go back empty-handed,

197
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,050
we will be humiliated.

198
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,390
But people
with the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

199
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,830
have all the four tokens.

200
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,350
Say no more.

201
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,830
I will get the tokens.

202
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,030
It’s Li Jinrong’s birthday next month.

203
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,640
Those young men will go
and celebrate her birthday.

204
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,250
She will have all the tokens.

205
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,390
As long as I sneak
into the Fortress of the Forty-Eight,

206
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,120
I’ll stand a chance

207
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,350
to take them away.

208
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,710
Lord.

209
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,030
You had a relapse of old wound.

210
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,480
You can’t risk your neck to go there.

211
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,390
I even killed Li Zheng.

212
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,880
Why can’t I

213
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,800
kill Li Jinrong?

214
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,910
I hear the Third Prince

215
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,200
has been searching treasures

216
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,240
for Li Jinrong’s birthday.

217
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,800
Is that true?

218
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,680
Yes.

219
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,440
Lord Chu had planned

220
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,350
to catch Chen Zichen to win honor.

221
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:29,200
Unexpectedly, Zhou Fei saved him.

222
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,080
Since that,

223
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,200
the Third Prince has been
grateful to her.

224
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,590
I’m sure he wants
to find a treasure for Li Jinrong

225
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,240
and make friends
with the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

226
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,800
through her birthday.

227
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,830
Seems like

228
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,150
we should go and help him.

229
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,680
Weed Spirit.

230
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,590
Look what I’ve bought you.

231
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,200
Fei.

232
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,560
What happened?

233
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,880
Go. Go find Yin Pei with me.

234
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,390
Miss Zhou. Mr. Xie.

235
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,910
Mr. Li left a message

236
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,470
that Yin Pei took away Miss Wu.

237
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,840
He’s looking for Yin Pei.

238
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,390
Yin Pei made trouble again.

239
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,750
Mr. Li advised to take separate ways.

240
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,870
He has gone
to the Four-guardian Mountain.

241
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,600
He will contact you
through secret services.

242
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,360
Okay, we know.

243
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,480
Fei.

244
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,960
That’s what you tried to tell me?

245
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,460
(Yin’s Mansion)

246
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,230
My family was also destroyed.

247
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,720
The Demons killed my father.

248
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,270
Everyone wants the longevity lock
from me.

249
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,560
I understand you.

250
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,720
My family is gone.

251
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,360
The Fortress of the Forty-Eight
is prosperous.

252
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,910
People say

253
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,990
my father isn’t as strong as Li Zheng.

254
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,790
Bah!

255
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,230
We respect your father

256
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,840
and his martial arts.

257
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,800
The Mountain Sword is
an unparalleled martial art.

258
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,870
I’m afraid bad men will use it

259
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,320
to do evil things.

260
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,270
The Mountain Sword belongs to my family.

261
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,800
It’s mine!

262
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,200
Besides,

263
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,080
what evil things did I do

264
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,150
with it?

265
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,080
Whistling arrow of our Fortress.

266
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,910
Let’s go have a look.

267
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:06,720
-Go.
-Go.

268
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,440
Have you checked it out?

269
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,270
What was the whistling arrow for
last night?

270
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,320
I just figured it out.

271
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,510
The whistling arrow was shot

272
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,230
nearly Yin’s Manor.

273
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,680
Why did men with the Fortress go there?

274
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,060
(Yin’s Manor)

275
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,600
Let’s go separate ways.

276
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,600
If you meet Yin Pei,

277
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,750
don’t fight him directly.

278
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,800
Try to hold him back.

279
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,230
The priority is to find Chuchu.

280
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,230
In case of trouble,

281
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,960
let’s meet in the woods
at the village entrance.

282
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,750
Aye.

283
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,030
Who is it?

284
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,910
Chuchu, it’s me.

285
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,390
Sheng?

286
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,840
Sheng!

287
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,600
Go. Let’s get out of here.

288
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,990
Chuchu, are you alright?

289
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,870
Yes.

290
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,230
Move a step forward

291
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,110
and I’ll kill her.

292
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,780
(Yin’s Manor)

293
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:31,630
Do you think everyone wants to kill you?

294
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,870
You feel everyone owes you.

295
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,840
I’d like to give you a second chance.

296
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,840
Write down

297
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,600
the full Manual of the Mountain Sword.

298
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:49,870
Sheng.

299
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,540
(Manual of the Mountain Sword)

300
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,030
Have you remembered, Pei?

301
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,110
Just remember.

302
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,680
We practice martial arts

303
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,630
to protect those we love.

304
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,200
I just came up with an idea.

305
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,150
I don’t know if it will work.

306
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,720
He learnt martial arts from his father.

307
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,230
He knew the moves.

308
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:01,270
But he didn’t know the sequence.

309
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,990
If I change the sequence,

310
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,360
he may not know.

311
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,320
We think alike.

312
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,840
That’s exactly what I thought of.

313
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,200
Men with the Fortress again?

314
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,960
Why are you here?

315
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,390
This was Yin’s Manor!

316
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,200
Why are you here?

317
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,870
Qinghui?

318
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,320
You’re looking for Qinghui, aren’t you?

319
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,720
Aren’t you?

320
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,630
Qinghui!

321
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,600
Let’s go!

322
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,150
Keep an eye on these losers.

323
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,510
Hyah!

324
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,900
(Manual of the Mountain Sword)

325
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,630
The manual

326
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,440
doesn’t look like the one

327
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,840
you burned.

328
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,080
It’s the same.

329
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,750
Compare it and you’ll know.

330
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,070
Practice it.

331
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,720
It’s your family stuff.

332
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,270
Why do you let him practice it?

333
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,800
It’s him!

334
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,480
Over there.

335
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,200
After them! Hurry!

336
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,230
They’re ahead.

337
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,600
Don’t look back. Run.

338
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,320
Get down.

339
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,440
Sister, where are our parents?

340
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,750
Keep your voice down.

341
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,560
Where’s Qinghui?

342
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,960
We don’t know who is Qinghui.

343
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,270
Stop kidding!

344
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,510
He locked you up here, didn’t he?

345
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,030
Stop!

346
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,110
I have the world’s best

347
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,630
Manual of the Mountain Sword.

348
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,200
Do you want it?

349
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,200
I want both the Manual and the scabbard!

350
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,750
Give it to me!

351
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,440
Manual of the Mountain Sword.

352
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,200
You can’t use it.

353
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,600
I keep the unique skill in my mind.

354
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,270
If you don’t believe me, practice it.

355
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,630
Think carefully about it.

356
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,360
You must give the scabbard to me!

357
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,910
Otherwise,

358
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,960
I will kill you all!

359
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,200
The more

360
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,560
I practice,

361
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,230
the worse I feel.

362
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,840
Why do I feel worse?

363
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,150
Tell me.

364
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,150
What’s the unique skill

365
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:55,560
of practicing the Mountain Sword?

366
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,870
Let us go, or I won’t tell you.

367
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,160
Why do you think

368
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,630
you can negotiate with me?

369
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,230
Tong Tianyang.

370
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,750
Do you want the scabbard

371
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,200
for the Color of Ocean and Heaven?

372
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,750
We can cooperate.

373
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,720
Why must I cooperate with you?

374
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,600
I can give the scabbard to you.

375
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,480
Let me join the Demons

376
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,680
and help me reinvigorate my family.

377
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,510
Why must I let you in?

378
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,960
I can give you the Phoenix Pill.

379
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,750
I had such great martial arts

380
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,030
by taking the pills.

381
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,360
Don’t you want a try?

382
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,740
(Tablet of Yin Wenlan)

383
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,990
(Ancestral Hall)

384
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:01,990
(Ancestral Hall)
Father.

385
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,320
I’m finally back.

386
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,870
Don’t worry.

387
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,720
Today,

388
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,270
I will offer a sacrifice to you

389
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:16,510
with the blood of your enemy.

390
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,320
Let go of me.

391
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,870
Let’s fight in a fair way.

392
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,610
A fair way?

393
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,300
Yin Pei.

394
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,290
I know you want to take revenge.

395
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:37,080
But the Demons are near, I’m afraid.

396
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,560
Tong Tianyang is missing.

397
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,840
If they come,

398
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,440
we can’t leave safely

399
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,440
when they shoot.

400
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,910
That’s great.

401
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,270
Mr. Li, please keep watch for us

402
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,870
at the entrance of the woods.

403
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,960
Miss Wu and I

404
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,870
will take revenge.

405
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,800
Don’t you want to take revenge
by yourself?

406
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,840
I want it.

407
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,200
If the Demons come,

408
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,600
I’ll let you know.

409
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,700
Let me do it.

410
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,720
How nice was Mr. Yin Wenlan to you?

411
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,230
You mean how nice my father was to me?

412
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,600
Your father?

413
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,630
Yes.

414
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:44,800
I’m Mountain Sword Yin Wenlan’s son,

415
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,870
Yin Pei!

416
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,800
What are you laughing at?

417
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,480
I heard

418
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,360
Qinghui with the Four-guardian Mountain

419
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,130
was Yin Wenlan’s descendant.

420
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:03,360
I had thought it was his nephew

421
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,080
who had gone the wrong way.

422
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,870
I didn’t expect you to be his son.

423
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,230
I guess

424
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,870
you made yourself in such a mess

425
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:16,080
just to take revenge.

426
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,030
My father was chivalrous

427
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,990
and kind to people.

428
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,270
That’s why

429
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,910
you managed to kill him!

430
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,390
It’s so naive of you!

431
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,200
The Yin family has no more descendant.

432
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,940
You...

433
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,300
You’re not Yin Wenlan’s son!

434
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,680
Nonsense!

435
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,200
At Liu’s Manor,

436
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,480
Madam Nichang tried to kill you,
didn’t she?

437
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,870
Yes, so what?

438
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:44,230
Madam Nichang was
one of the four major spies.

439
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,630
She never meddles with
the Four-guardian Mountain.

440
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,720
Do you know why she wanted to kill you?

441
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,990
Because you’re the baby

442
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:52,110
she saved.

443
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,440
Now, you’ve been the biggest bane
to the martial world.

444
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,440
She feels guilty.

445
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,870
So, she wants to kill you personally.

446
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,110
Countless people want to kill me!

447
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,510
Do you dare to let me finish?

448
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,340
It’s really their family feud.

449
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:36,380
But how can I leave Chuchu in danger?

450
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,600
I had a friend

451
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,230
named Letang,

452
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:46,080
who had great artistry of blade.

453
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,200
I had planned to recruit him.

454
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,200
But he used to live a free life.

455
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,510
He only wanted to rob people.

456
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,230
He even set a Killing Trap,

457
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,200
outside the town,

458
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,630
just to rob all passers-by,

459
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:02,840
until Chief Chang Huan of Zhongyuan Sect

460
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,150
passed his place.

461
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,750
(Grave of Yin Wenlan)
Do you know

462
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,750
what Chang Huan loved most?

463
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,840
He was famous for his sick son.

464
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,390
His son was nearly a stillbirth
when he was born.

465
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,800
He survived with all kinds
of wonderful drugs.

466
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,110
He was then known as Baby Ginseng.

467
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,230
Whoever ate his flesh

468
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,150
would be cured of any disease.

469
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,210
Mr. Yin.

470
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,970
When you were little,

471
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,720
were you weak?

472
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,110
In this world,

473
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,800
a lot of kids were weak!

474
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,870
What a coincidence!

475
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,910
My friend had planned to grab the baby.

476
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:40,800
After some preparation,

477
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,320
he easily destroyed

478
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,230
Zhongyuan Sect.

479
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,360
You know what?

480
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,870
Two persons interfered with him.

481
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,750
Do you know who they were?

482
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,960
Li Zheng and Madam Nichang.

483
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,200
They didn’t like my friend
for killing innocent people.

484
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,910
They killed him

485
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,150
and took you away.

486
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,990
In front of my friend,

487
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,840
they talked about giving you
to Yin Wenlan.

488
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,440
A minion of my friend’s escaped

489
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,600
and found me.

490
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,870
He wanted me to kill Li Zheng
and Madam Nichang

491
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,110
to avenge my friend.

492
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:18,990
But Li Zheng hid in the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight for years.

493
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:21,630
I can’t take revenge.

494
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,230
Yin Pei.

495
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,560
Yin Wenlan has no descendants.

496
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,150
I’m afraid Yin Wenlan’s body
has been ashes.

497
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:33,030
What’s the advantage of being his son?

498
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,110
You’re lying!

499
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,390
I’m not Baby Ginseng!

500
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,630
I’m not an orphan!

501
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:44,150
They didn’t pick me!

502
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:55,340
(Grave of Yin Wenlan)

503
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,270
Where’s Madam Nichang?

504
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,370
Take me to see her.

505
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:27,560
Damn it!

506
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,800
What happened here?

507
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,920
Mr. Li.

508
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,990
We were waiting for you and Miss Wu.

509
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:43,950
But Tong Tianyang came,
following the whistling arrow.

510
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:46,080
We fought against his minions.

511
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,470
We both lost half of our men.

514
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,360
You can leave.

515
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,800
I’ll go look for her alone.

516
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,920
-Mr. Li.
-Go.

517
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,320
Mr. Li.

518
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,560
We were just informed

519
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,750
Miss Zhou was looking for us.

520
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,320
Shall we get her here?

521
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,270
No.

522
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,160
Ask her to go to Hengyang.

523
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,670
We’ll meet her there.

524

I’m fine.

too much force.

00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,080
did you and Mr. Li save a baby?

592
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,550
How did you know?

593
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,270
Where was the baby?

594
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:25,710
Did you give him to Mr. Yin Wenlan?

595
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,230
Mr. Yin.

596
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:35,800
Take the baby back home.

597
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,320
Or he will suffer here.

598
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,080
Come on.

599
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:44,270
See? He stopped crying in your arms.

600
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,920
He did?

601
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,080
Sit down and it’ll be easy to hold him.

602
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,230
Look.

603
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,270
He really stopped crying.

604
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,950
Stop crying, baby.

605
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,950
Has Chang named him?

606
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,510
When we saved him,

607
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:02,710
there was an amulet behind his neck.

608
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,230
(Pei)
There was a word on it.

609
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,470
-Okay. Let me have a look.
-It’s Pei.

610
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:07,900
Pei.

611
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,660
(Pei)

612
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,670
But he’s too weak.

613
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,400
I’m afraid
he can’t practice marital arts.

614
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,320
If he learns martial arts,
he’ll be like us.

615
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,270
It’s not good.

616
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:21,750
I’d like him to study hard

617
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,160
and be an official.

618
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,130
Maybe he can help the world
and its people.

619
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,020
Madam.

620
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,020
So,

621
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,240
the baby is Yin Pei?

622
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,010
Yes.

623
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,770
What a pity that he let us down

624
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,320
and did evil things.

625
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,890
He didn’t turn out to help the world.

626
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,580
We changed his fate.

627
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:57,580
Maybe we shouldn’t have saved the baby.

628
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,840
It was my fault to save him.

629
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,600

can only be passed down
to Yin’s descendants.

632
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:19,750
That’s because
every one of the Yin family

633
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,640
has a special type of pulse.

634
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,260
They breathe and practice differently.

635
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,470
No one can use the Mountain Sword
to its fullest

636
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,800
unless they’re with the Yin family.

For the sake

641
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,270
that I held you back,

642
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,280
I can pretend

643

644
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,750

645
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,670
I would also forget

646
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,600

665
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,640
He took

666
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,600
the last one.
