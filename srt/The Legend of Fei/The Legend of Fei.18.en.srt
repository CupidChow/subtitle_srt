=Episode 18=

17
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,040
Luckily,

18
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,080
I ran into two people
and they led the way for me.

19
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,760
How do you know

20
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,230
they would come to me?

21
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,640
We met by chance.

22
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,550
Just by looking at her,

23
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,060
I know she practiced her
internal strength in a wrong way.

24
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,310
In Hengyang,

25
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,910
only Madam Nichang’s

26
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,300
Floating Palm can cure her.

27
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,750
In that case,

28
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,090
you are just in time.

29
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,320
You choose the perfect timing

30
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,830
to take advantage of us.

31
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,640
Madam, you are indeed smart.

32
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,450
This girl is badly hurt.

33
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,620
Even for the sake of Li Zheng,

34
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,760
you won’t just let her die.

35
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,420
You are impressive.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,880
You did nothing

37
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,040
and cost me most of my power.

38
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,110
You deserve the name of
the Head of Demons.

39
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,630
You are sinister, treacherous,

40
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,910
and extremely shameless.

41
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,160
But there is one thing
I don’t understand.

42
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,600
Why did you

43
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,750
take all these efforts

44
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,160
just to see me, a little singer?

45
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,750
I’m here today

46
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,720
because I have something to ask you.

47
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,670
Do you know

48
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,440
the Color of Ocean and Heaven?

49
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,580
I have never heard of it.

50
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,170
What’s the Color of Ocean and Heaven?

51
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,600
Madam, let’s not do this the hard way.

52
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Go.

53
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,270
With your current power,

54
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,520
I’m afraid you can’t protect everyone
in Qiaoyun House.

55
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,640
That’s enough!

56
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,930
Shen Tianshu.

57
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,340
Believe it or not,

58
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,750
I only know
that the Color of Ocean and Heaven

59
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,750
is a huge place of treasure.

60
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,750
That’s only because

61
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,520
I heard some elders talk about it.

62
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,080
But the Color of Ocean and Heaven
concerns the world.

63
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,360
I really don’t know

64
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,520
where it is

65
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,710
and what’s inside.

66
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,370
Is it?

67
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,870
Madam, you’d better tell me the truth.

68
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,270
I don’t want to be never able to see

69
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,140
the performance of Yuyi Troupe again.

70
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,670
No matter how you threaten me with them,

71
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,760
I have nothing else to tell you.

72
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,120
Shen Tianshu, I need to warn you.

73
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,760
Don’t be too wild.

74
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,040
This is Hengyang,

75
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,110
not your Demons Manor.

76
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,270
The garrison of Lord Gantang

77
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,730
is not far from Hengyang.

78
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,040
If you have to

79
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,570
make a scene today,

80
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,990
my Yuyi Troupe will be there for you!

81
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,400
Good.

82
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:59,290
I will take your words this time.

83
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,860
Sorry for bothering you.

84
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,010
I’ll come to enjoy the Yuyi Troupe’s
performance some other day.

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,480
Any time.

86
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,610
Master, take the medicine.

87
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,440
Master, Mr. Qian Suiyou
wants to see you.

88
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,230
You may leave.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What’s the matter?

90
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,160
Thank you for saving Fei.

91
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,820
My appreciation is beyond words.

92
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,340
I’ll be at your disposal

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,080
if the Yuyi Troupe needs me.

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,570
You don’t need to thank me.

95
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,060
I didn’t do it for you.

96
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,390
Back then,

97
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,090
Zhou Fei’s grandfather
was my good friend.

98
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,020
My friend’s granddaughter was injured.

99
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,460
How could I stand by?

100
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,040
No matter who you did it for,

101
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,120
you still did me a big favor.

102
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,780
You seem to have deep feelings
for Miss Zhou.

103
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,790
All right.

104
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,620
Let’s drop the empty gesture.

105
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,950
There is something

106
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,800
that I want to know.

107
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,670
Madam, please go ahead.

108
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,550
Recently I heard

109
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,570
there is some turbulence

110
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,950
relevant to the descendants
of South Blade.

111
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,230
I think you should have gone through

112
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,720
those things.

113
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,730
That’s what you are talking about.

114
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,440
I would like to know

115
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,070
the details of the whole story

116
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,520
and the truth.

117
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,180
Some time ago,

118
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,330
Timber Wolf of Demons, Shen Tianshu
showed up in Four-guardian Mountain.

119
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,140
Then Huo’s Manor suffered an accident.

120
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,720
Huo Liantao fled away.

121
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,030
And Old Master Huo passed away.

122
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,920
Shen Tianshu?

123
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,430
Why did he show up
in Four-guardian Mountain?

124
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,790
I heard

125
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,160
that he covets Huo’s kicking techniques,

126
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,550
so he went to kill them.

127
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,620
But I don’t think

128
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,720
the rumors are true.

129
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,540
He is the Lord of Demons Manor.

130
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,230
There is no way he would lay his eyes on

131
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,300
Huo’s special kicking techniques.

132
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,380
By the way,

133
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,390
there is another thing.

134
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,920
After the death of General Wang Lin,

135
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,110
his family members
were robbed and killed.

136
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,040
Who sent the killer?

137
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,040
The Blessed Dog,

138
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,390
Qiu Tianjin.

139
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,940
This is confusing.

140
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,510
Yeah.

141
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,360
They are just orphans and widows.

142
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,020
Why would he send a big falcon
to hunt them down?

143
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,070
So?

144
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,390
The Color of Ocean and Heaven.

145
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,790
I’m afraid the people of Demons Manor

146
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,350
have been looking for it
for a long time.

147
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,740
Shen Tianshu got nothing useful today.

148
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,520
I’m afraid there will be

149
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,760
a bloody storm.

150
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,750
That’s ridiculous.

151
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,030
It’s despicable to

152
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,840
harm the innocent

153
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,930
just for the hearsay.

154
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,080
There are people killing to get it.

155
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,350
But they don’t know

156
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,130
the Color of Ocean and Heaven
is useless to them.

157
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,350
If everyone thinks like you do,

158
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,530
the world can be at peace.

159
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,320
When Shen Tianshu mentioned
the Color of Ocean and Heaven,

160
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,590
you didn’t seem to be surprised.

161
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,560
Who do you belong to?

162
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,780
Wang Lin?

163
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,010
No.

164
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,480
You are Zhou Yitang’s person.

165
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,760
My surname is Xie.

166
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,970
My name is Yun.

167
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,130
I’m Xie Yun.

168
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,340
Xie Yun?

169
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,320
It’s getting late.

170
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,530
I’ll leave you to rest.

171
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,070
Thanks again.

172
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,820
I won’t see you out.

173
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,270
Xie Yun.

174
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:25,980
(Qiaoyun House)

175
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,880
Fei, you are awake!

176
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,090
How are you feeling?

177
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,200
How’s Madam Nichang doing?

178
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,230
Madam Nichang

179
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,000
took the secret pill
made by Yuyi Troupe.

180
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,670
She is resting

181
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,760
in seclusion these days.

182
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,840
She should be fine.

183
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,080
Rest assured.

184
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,110
Just get better,

185
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,140
only in this way won’t you
waste Madam’s efforts.

186
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,500
Did Shen Tianshu come?

187
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,960
What Madam Nichang said is true.

188
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,790
Shen Tianshu has got
the information here,

189
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,980
he probably won’t come again.

190
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,820
Seriously, how are you feeling now?

191
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,850
Are you sure you are okay?

192
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,760
Does it still hurt?

193
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,910
Are you all right?

194
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,710
You are energetic now.

195
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,800
You should be fine.

196
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,420
I’m thirsty.

197
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,530
I’ll get some water for you.

198
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,370
I’m hungry.

199
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,440
Let’s go. I’ll take you to the tea house
to grab a bite.

200
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,150
I’ll get your clothes for you.
Wait for me.

201
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,030
How long did I sleep?

202
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:58,540
(Fortress of the Forty-Eight)

203
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,410
Madam.

204
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,740
(The Secret Service defected)

205
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,150
Sir, do you have rooms?

206
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,470
Sirs.

207
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,710
We are the only one inn

208
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,110
within a radius of dozens of miles.

209
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,900
Well...

210
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,910
One good room!

211
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,850
-Two rooms!
-Two rooms!

212
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,880
Two rooms.

213
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,470
That’s not enough for two rooms.

214
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,640
Waiter!

215
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,530
Two good rooms!

216
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,400
No problem. I’m coming!

217
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,410
Sirs, please go upstairs!

218
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,060
(Hongfu Inn)

219
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,400
I’m done. Come in.

220
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,910
What a beauty.

221
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,590
My heart aches

222
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,420
at the sight of you.

223
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,190
Where are my clothes?

224
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,660
Why do you want me to dress like this?

225
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,930
Where are my clothes?

226
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,030
Your clothes are dirty.

227
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,410
It’s inappropriate to wear them.

228
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,350
You look good

229
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,480
in this dress.

230
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,350
Stop watching me, let’s go.

231
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,520
Do you want to go out with this hair?

232
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,440
Or what?

233
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,230
Come on, let me comb your hair.

234
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,230
Sit down.

235
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,400
Let me comb your hair.

236
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,440
Yun.

237
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,590
You know,

238
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,580
I hate to see a beauty being wasted.

239
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,140
Tell me,

240
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,660
what kind of hairstyle do you want?

241
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,590
Cross Bun?

242
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,760
Feitian Bun?

243
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,440
Or

244
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,020
Lingyun Bun?

245
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,110
How about this?

246
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,020
The Falling Bun is also pretty.

247
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,790
You need to move less
after I get you this hairstyle.

248
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,760
Otherwise, it will get loose in a while.

249
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,280
Mr. Xie.

250
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,280
Even you know how to dress up a beauty,

251
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,550
you don’t need to
practice your skill on me.

252
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,400
I have no ambitions.

253
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,640
I don’t want to be a scholar

254
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,150
nor a general.

255
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,790
I just want to be a maid

256
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,620
to comb my future wife’s hair.

257
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,280
How is it?

258
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,830
It’s ugly.

259
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,800
I think it’s pretty.

260
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:29,710
I mean,

261
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,640
why do you have to wear this?

262
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,950
You finally dress up

263
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,160
and you have to cover yourself?

264
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,490
It’s like walking at night
in fancy clothes.

265
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,290
It’s too ugly.

266
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,370
Fine.

267
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,970
Don’t just eat.

268
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,400
The clothes I borrowed

269
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,110
would break if you keep eating.

270
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,280
That’s because

271
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,710
you borrowed such a dress.

272
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,940
I feel awkward.

273
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,000
I think it’s pretty.

274
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,880
I mean,

275
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,680
don’t just eat.

276
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,350
You escaped from death this time.

277
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,640
Have you reflected about it?

278
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,950
Will you still pretend
to be tough again?

279
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,510
Do you hear me?

280
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,310
Got it.

281
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,430
I won’t pretend to be tough,

282
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,710
but I won’t be timid.

283
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,430
If there is an injustice,

284
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,570
I will still meddle in it.

285
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,400
It’s just

286
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,280
my current martial art is too weak.

287
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,770
I have to practice harder.

288
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,120
What are you doing?

289
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,890
If masters are

290
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,490
divided into nine ranks,

291
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,110
you blocked the Dragon Master
in a narrow passage

292
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,640
and killed his men,

293
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,690
and you survived.

294
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,610
Am I a master?

295
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,190
Yes.

296
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,430
Though

297
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,090
you took advantage of
the opponent’s underestimation of you,

298
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,230
you don’t have

299
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,640
a good weapon in your hand.

300
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,860
What you did

301
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,560
can prove that your current skill

302
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,760
is enough for you to be
a second-rank master.

303
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,030
Second-rank master?

304
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,800
But as a second-rank master,

305
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,980
your luck is not that good.

306
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,920
There are small potatoes everywhere
and you didn’t run into any of them.

307
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,310
The people you met

308
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,520
are all scaring big shots.

309
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,640
And it makes you look embarrassed.

310
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,230
You are just a little song writer.

311
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,470
Just sing your song,

312
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,280
why do you start to wiggle?

313
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,710
However,

314
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,300
don’t be complacent.

315
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,040
Learning martial arts is like
climbing a mountain.

316
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,020
There is always
another mountain after one.

317
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,710
There are still

318
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,470
many top masters in the world.

319
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,000
Such as the famous seniors.

320
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,880
Qi’s Taoist priest

321
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,520
and Huo’s master?

322
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,040
Yes.

323
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,590
Above the first rank

324
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,110
are top masters.

325
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,670
It’s a rarity of the rarities.

326
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,070
Regardless of their reputation,

327
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,300
only their names

328
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,000
can reverberate like thunder.

329
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,040
In that case,

330
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,060
it’s good to be second-rank master.

331
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,430
Are the people of Demons Manor

332
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,560
and Four-guardian Mountain top masters?

333
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,330
Mu Xiaoqiao is one.

334
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,060
Dragon Master is not.

335
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,340
Shen Tianshu is.

336
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,980
But I’m afraid people like Qiu Tianjin

337
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,740
are not good enough.

338
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,070
Dragon Master ranks first
among the Four Guardians

339
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,310
because he has a bunch of thugs

340
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,520
to fight and kill for him.

341
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,110
He is treacherous

342
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,000
and has a lot of gimmicks.

343
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,400
Such people are very dangerous.

344
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,240
One careless move can
make you get killed.

345
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,440
But if you call him a top master,

346
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,350
let alone others,

347
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,760
the other three of the Four Guardians

348
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,110
will sneer at him.

349
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,740
Above the top master

350
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,520
is the grand master.

351
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,770
Do you know the difference between them?

352
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,190
What’s it?

353
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,430
It hurts!

354
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,590
I’ll tell you. I’ll tell you.

355
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,590
The difference between them is

356
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,000
that there are top masters
in every generation,

357
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,140
but not the grand masters.

358
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,160
Those two apprentices
of Yellow and Green Palm

359
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,590
chose a different path. They have
the righteous side and the evil side.

360
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,520
The two of them share one martial art.

361
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,430
It’s a little bit inadequate.

362
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,710
North Blade Guan Feng
retired a long time ago.

363
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,230
He only left an unknown apprentice

364
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,150
who is dead now.

365
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,660
It also lacks something.

366
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,640
As for Yin Wenlan,

367
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,340
he is the uncrowned lord
among the martial artists.

368
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,940
The South Blade established a new school
and completed the martial art.

369
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,270
These two

370
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,280
can be called

371
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,510
grand masters.

372
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,420
Twenty years ago,

373
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,760
there was a wealth of martial artists.

374
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,060
It was the heyday.

375
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,300
Many rare martial arts

376
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,140
resurfaced.

377
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,000
People now are still talking about

378
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,820
the anecdotes back then.

379
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,650
It’s a pity

380
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,010
that the era of
great talents is too short.

381
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,420
It passed

382
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,800
like a gust of wind.

383
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,450
Yeah.

384
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,160
Yin Wenlan and my grandfather
passed away.

385
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,310
Duan Jiuniang is missing.

386
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,250
The North Blade is no longer
being practiced.

387
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,900
Latecomers like my mother

388
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,880
are also burdened with the drudgery

389
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,930
of Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

390
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,460
No progress has been made so far.

391
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,520
I’m afraid it won’t be easy to

392
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,700
take one step forward in the future.

393
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,390
Shen Tianshu attacked
Huo’s Manor viciously.

394
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,980
Then he looked around for
Huo’s kicking techniques

395
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,730
because he wants to
reach the next level.

396
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,780
Unfortunately,

397
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,580
such people

398
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,720
use dirty tricks and have nasty mind.

399
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,320
I think

400
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,770
he should just give up early.

401
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,230
Mr. Li.

402
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,580
Miss Wu, why are you sweating?

403
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,760
I’m fine. I had a nightmare.

404
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,000
Why are you here

405
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,010
so late?

406
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,230
I noticed that you haven’t eaten today.

407
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,520
I got you some food.

408
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,220
You can grab a bite.

409
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,950
Thank you.

410
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:28,890
Please come in.

411
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,190
Listen, I can get out safely.

412
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:49,110
But he will recognize you.

413
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,190
If he finds you,

414
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,600
we will be all over.

415
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,460
Let me find a way.

416
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,240
It hurts!

417
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,740
Mr. Li.

418
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,680
Is your hand okay?

419
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,520
It’s nothing.

420
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,250
Just a little sprain.

421
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,380
That trap couldn’t hurt me.

422
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,480
Sorry, Mr. Li.

423
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,310
You got hurt

424
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,350
because of me.

425
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,680
If you don’t mind,

426
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,790
don’t call me Mr. Li.

427
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,640
Mr. Li,

428
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,600
do I still look like a young master now?

429
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,880
You can call me Li Sheng.

430
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,880
Or call me Sheng

431
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,690
like Fei does.

432
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,880
Li Sheng.

433
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,120
You don’t need to call me Miss Wu.

434
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,900
Just call me Chuchu.

435
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,370
I am not a lady anymore.

436
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,130
Chuchu.

437
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,310
Get some rest.

438
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,590
Eat something. I’ll go back.

439
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,300
Okay.

440
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,550
By the way,

441
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,080
only knowing how to
use weapons is pointless.

442
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,890
After what I’ve gone through
these years,

443
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,190
I finally understand

444
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,390
that food and clothing

445
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,070
are top priorities

446
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,220
for the people.

447
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,060
Looks like that person
is going to close his stall.

448
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,930
Do him a favor for me.

449
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,240
You can give him as much as you want.

450
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,070
You are still a poor song writer.

451
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,110
Why are you so generous
in aiding needy people?

452
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,830
Money is mere worldly possession.
It’s a stopgap.

453
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,950
We can’t live without it.

454
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,090
But it’s not that important.

455
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,160
It’s not as precious as the fate
that makes us meet.

456
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:32,850
Take it.

457
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,760
Who just said

458
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,590
food and clothing are top priorities?

459
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,920
How come it suddenly becomes

460
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,790
worldly possession and a stopgap?

461
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:42,930
Well,

462
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,190
are you worried that I’ll be poor?

463
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,680
After all these years being out there,

464
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,660
I’ve acquired quite a lot of skills
to make money.

465
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:50,840
Well,

466
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,310
take a walk with me?

467
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,880
You’ll know how to make money then.

468
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,260
I don’t want to hang around.

469
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,390
I want to go home.

470
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,200
I want to know how my mother is doing.

471
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,290
Fortress of the Forty-Eight...

472
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:09,960
He...

473
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,950
You just barely escaped from death

474
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,190
under the three energies.

475
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,640
You’d better
take care of yourself first.

476
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,160
Your mother has been in charge
for so all these years.

477
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,830
Her reputation is not fake.

478
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,290
Just relax.

479
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,750
Madam.

480
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,490
-Madam.
-Madam.

481
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,520
Madam. It’s too late today.

482
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,210
Why don’t you leave tomorrow?

483
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,760
The Secret Service defected.

484
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,400
It’s not a trivial matter.

485
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,430
I’m afraid something serious happened
down the mountain.

486
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,710
I’d better go to see Lord Gantang

487
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,920
to discuss countermeasures.

488
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,950
After I leave,

489
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,840
you’ll be in charge of

490
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,850
(Token)
protecting our fortress.

491
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,780
(Token)

492
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,560
Madam.

493
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,110
I will protect our fortress
with my life.

494
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:30,890
Fine.

495
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:41,950
Thank you for your hard work.

496
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,710
Since you gave me the money,

497
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,110
just pick one story.

498
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,350
I don’t know much about it.

499
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,880
I haven’t heard any of it.

500
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,700
I won’t pick one.

501
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,800
She is too young to appreciate it.

502
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,430
Well,

503
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,110
why don’t you tell her
a lively story for fun?

504
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,460
Then she will go to sleep later.

505
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,450
I will tell a story about
current affairs.

506
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,110
It’s hearsay

507
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,520
and it’s not necessarily true.

508
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,800
Hope you can enjoy it.

509
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:20,040
Recently I heard that several
important events happened

510
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,190
at the border with our enemy.

511
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,710
And there is an incredible figure.

512
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,400
It’s said that this person is a heroine.

513
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,400
She lives in the mountain
and masters a great martial art.

514
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,400
The way she showed up is impressive.

515
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,560
-An incredible heroine?
-When she came out,

516
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,430
-Near the border?
-she met Shen Tianshu

517
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,880
-Would it be Duan Jiuniang?
-who was attacking Huo’s Manor

518
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,470
and besieging Huarong.

519
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,280
The people in the city

520
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,430
were scared.

521
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,690
The heroine

522
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,040
defeated Shen Tianshu

523
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,830
and killed the Blessed Dog on her own.

524
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,760
She went all the way to Mount Heng

525
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,710
and rushed out of a bloody road

526
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,310
being unscathed.

527
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,680
When she arrived at Mount Heng,

528
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,680
she defended someone against
an injustice at the post.

529
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,950
And she set a trap

530
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:06,110
to drive out Dragon Master.

531
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,420
Then she intercepted and killed him
at the foot of Mount Heng.

532
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,310
Everyone is applauding for it.

533
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,720
Guess who is her ancestor?

534
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,040
It’s said that she is
the descendant of South Blade.

535
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,280
It has been twenty years.

536
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,520
Snow-breaking Blade resurfaced again!

537
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,230
Have you also heard of

538
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,430
the descendant of South Blade?

539
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,000
Of course.

540
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,350
It’s said that the descendant
of South Blade

541
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,680
is a young heroine.

542
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,040
It’s really impressive.

543
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,920
She is indeed a heroine.

544
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,210
But she can’t be young.

545
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,830
Otherwise, how could she
punch Timber Wolf

546
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,520
and kick the Dragon Master?

547
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:49,430
As far as I know,

548
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,560
the descendant of South Blade

549
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,760
is a strong woman

550
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,000
carrying a big blade.

551
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,310
All you heard is nonsense.

552
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,040
Let me tell you.

553
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,560
In fact, the descendant of South Blade

554
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,590
is not human at all.

555
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,860
What?

556
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:04,800
Think about it.

557
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,190
How unreliable the rumors are?

558
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,950
In the cordon formed by
thousands of people

559
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,160
from Demons Manor
and Four-guardian Mountain.

560
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,640
Be careful to not
laugh yourself to death.

561
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,190
To Kill the Dragon Master.

562
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,520
I have a friend who saw it in person.

563
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,470
Fei!

564
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,920
That’s a blue-faced monster with fangs

565
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,070
that can slap a bear to death.

566
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:21,830
Really?

567
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,580
(Hengyang)

568
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,380
The flower is so beautiful.

569
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,430
I’ll take one of these.

570
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,560
Okay.

571
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,160
How much is it?

572
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,350
Three coins.

573
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,230
Here.

574
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,450
Thank you.

575
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,400
Waiter!

576
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,470
Bring me a pot of good tea!

577
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,140
All right!

578
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,040
Miss.

579
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,350
Why don’t you try
our Jiulong Jinyu Tea?

580
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,880
The tea is made by rocking four times
and roasting three times.

581
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,760
The tea is fragrant,
and it has a sweet aftertaste.

582
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,190
I’m sure you will like it.

583
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,520
Okay, I’ll take a pot.

584
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,070
All right!

585
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:35,490
Here.

586
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,590
Please enjoy it.

587
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,710
The coins were spent too fast.

588
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,640
The heroine

589
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,430
defeated Shen Tianshu

590
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,680
and killed the Blessed Dog on her own.

591
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,310
She rushed out of a bloody road

592
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:57,400
being unscathed. And she left.

593
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,800
Later, she went to Mount Heng alone.

594
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,470
She defended someone against
an injustice at the post.

595
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,760
And she set a trap

596
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,070
to drive out Dragon Master.

597
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,520
Then she intercepted and killed him
at the foot of Mount Heng.

598
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:12,600
Everyone is applauding for it.

599
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,670
Guess who is her ancestor?

600
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,760
Exactly.

601
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,520
She is the descendant of South Blade.

602
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,870
South Blade?

603
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,800
Speaking of the South Blade master,
Li Zheng.

604
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,000
-Is it my brother? Or Fei?
-Years ago,

605
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,840
he was a romantic and suave man

606
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,320
with chivalrous tenderness.

607
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,040
Tons of heroines and girls

608
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,430
fell for him.

609
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,870
Grandfather.

610
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:36,630
In order to avoid these romantic debts,

611
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:39,040
he hid in the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight.

612
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,470
Unexpectedly, he established

613
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,670
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

614
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,690
That’s nonsense!

615
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,540
My grandfather is not like that!

616
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,080
I mean...

617
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,520
I also want to hear your story.

618
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,280
Miss, be quiet if you want to hear it.

619
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,390
If you enjoy it, you can give me a tip.

620
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,950
This little girl.

621
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,340
How dare he say that
about my grandfather!

622
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,980
She is Li Zheng’s granddaughter?

623
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,680
Isn’t she the descendant of South Blade?

624
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,120
(Yang Jin, Know-medicine-all)

625
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:31,860
That’s great.

626
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,710
Come on, come on!

627
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,950
Take a look!

628
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,280
Take a look!

629
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,080
Come to hear my story!

630
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,040
Let me tell you an interesting story.

631
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:48,000
It’s said that there is an Old Master Li
at the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

632
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,870
Although Old Master Li
is skilled in using blade,

633
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:53,480
he is also very attentive.

634
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,400
His needlework is excellent.

635
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,080
He has a son and a daughter

636
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,630
who lost their mother
when they were young.

637
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:05,520
So Old Master Li plays the role
as both their mother and father.

638
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,000
He is

639
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,400
the South Blade.

640
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:12,230
(Fuze Tea House)
Good!

641
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:14,760
(Fuze Tea House)
Thank you, thank you.

642
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,120
(Fuze Tea House)
Here.

643
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,630
Thank you.

644
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,630
Make a way!

645
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,450
What’s wrong?
Didn’t you sleep well last night?

646
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,740
I had nightmares all night.

647
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,150
I thought you are afraid of nothing.

648
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,710
Do you also have nightmares?

649
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,760
What’s in your dream?

650
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,950
I dreamed about

651
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,280
Shen Tianshu

652
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,840
attacking me with a bunch of dogs

653
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,150
and the people of Four-guardian Mountain

654
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,840
and Dragon Master.

655
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,040
They formed a Tai Chi
Eight-trigram Formation.

656
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,340
Then I dreamed about

657
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:10,960
my mother.

658
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,070
She was beating me again.

659
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:18,320
She thrashed me with a whip
as thick as her waist.

660
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,910
I was like a spinning top.

661
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,520
The sky and earth were spinning round.

662
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,040
I’m still dizzy now.

663
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:28,190
I can understand that you dreamed of

664
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,240
those people attacking you.

665
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,660
But why would your mother beat you?

666
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,960
Probably because I made her

667
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,420
look too good this time.

668
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,090
What?

669
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,120
What are you thinking?

670
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,090
If your words are reliable...

671
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,860
Why are my words unreliable?

672
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,930
Look at those people.

673
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,080
Who can be

674
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,760
so knowledgeable

675
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,960
about the world like me?

676
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,800
What’s so proud of being a gossiper?

677
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,690
According to what you said,

678
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,600
with my ability,

679
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,650
I’m sort of a second-rank master, right?

680
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,660
You are when in a good condition.

681
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:29,050
What does the good condition mean?

682
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,670
Have you heard how they describe me?

683
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,150
They said you skipped two levels.

684
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,150
-You are better than the top expert.
-Yeah.

685
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,000
You are aimed straight for
the grand master.

686
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,040
Other masters are not worth mentioning.

687
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,800
They are too old
and have a bunch of kids.

688
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,820
They are way below you
in terms of youth and beauty.

689
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,460
Say more stuff like that.

690
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,190
Anyway, after I heard what they said,

691
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,000
I almost want to kneel down
in front of you.

692
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,760
Master, how about

693
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,670
I’ll be your driver from today,
is that okay?

694
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,390
Tell me

695
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,030
when you will knock down
the Heaven

696
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,600
I’ll have a name for my next play.

697
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,320
The name would be

698
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,000
the Story of Heroine Zhou Bladeless.

699
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,470
I just praised you.

700
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,280
Now you start to make up
horrible stories about me.

701
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,190
Do you believe
I’ll slap you on the tree?

702
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,280
No.

703
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,470
If you slap me on the tree,

704
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,860
how would you go back to
Fortress of the Forty-Eight?

705
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,630
You’ll probably walk to south

706
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,690
after you leave the room.

707
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,680
Am I that bad at telling the direction?

708
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,150
I’m afraid a lazy master

709
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,870
without general knowledge like you

710
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,490
has to beg at that time.

711
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:42,320
Master.

712
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:44,770
Can you sing the begging song?

713
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,870
Do you need me to teach you a few lines?

714
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,590
You might get some money along the way.

715
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,600
You mean,

716
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:01,220
will Shen Tianshu smear me
behind my back?

717
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,450
How?

718
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,360
Inform the world

719
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,870
that he was defeated

720
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,150
by a little girl?

721
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:11,660
You are right.

722
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,600
He is a famous villain.

723
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,430
How would he take these efforts

724
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:19,200
to deal with me, a nobody?

725
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:20,970
That’s unnecessary.

726
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,280
You don’t often hang out there.

727
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,250
You might not know that.

728
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,910
The people have been
holding a grudge against

729
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,150
Shen Tianshu for a long time.

730
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,740
There were rumors about

731
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,230
a Timber Wolf being defeated

732
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,360
by some kid

733
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,470
every half a month.

734
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,840
That’s already too much for
Shen Tianshu to deal with.

735
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,750
Normally, no one would believe it.

736
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,280
It’s just

737
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,080
your situation is a little special.

738
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,230
The Dragon Master

739
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,700
happened to be dead.

740
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,750
That’s troublesome.

741
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,650
If my mother knows it,

742
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,410
she is going to kill me.

743
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:07,680
Why are you still
thinking about your mother?

744
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,220
Fei.

745
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,870
Take my advice.

746
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:12,870
You’d better lay low

747
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,190
these days.

748
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,910
Try to not fight.

749
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,470
And try to play dead

750
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,470
before you go back to
Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

751
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:21,600
Let them talk.

752
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,520
As long as you don’t show up

753
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,630
and don’t cause trouble,

754
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,520
they will forget it

755
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,400
in a while.

756
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,040
Every time I chose to fight

757
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,800
because there was no other choice
under the circumstance.

758
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,520
I fight

759
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,230
because I have to.

760
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:35,080
When I was in
Fortress of the Forty-Eight,

761
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,000
only Li Sheng

762
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
kept picking fight with me.

763
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,420
We haven’t heard anything
about your cousin

764
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,670
along the way.

765
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:47,710
Don’t worry.

766
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,560
In this chaotic world,

767
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,270
no news is good news.

768
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:52,870
Don’t worry about it.

769
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,280
After I finish my meal,

770
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,430
I’m going to send a gift.

771
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:09,430
Well, will you go with me?

772
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,840
Okay, I’ll go with you.

773
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,630
I didn’t know my grandfather’s story

774
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,800
can be used to make money.

775
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,390
Those people are hateful.

776
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:23,440
They dare to slander...

777
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,760
What a black charcoal.

778
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,580
Who are you?

779
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:34,910
I’m Yang Jin.

780
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:35,950
Please!

781
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,280
You don’t look like a bad person.

782
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,560
What do you want?

783
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,390
What footwork is that?

784
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:48,760
It seems to be in order.

785
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,840
And the moves of the blade.

786
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,740
When did South Blade have such moves?

787
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:55,080
How is it?

788
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:57,640
Are you afraid?

789
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:00,280
What is this again?

790
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,990
Her eyes are full of spiritual power.

791
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,630
Is that Mind-controlling Skill?

792
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,470
Are you nuts?

793
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,470
Won’t you fight?

794
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:23,430
Sorry. Sorry.

795
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:25,040
I didn’t mean it!

796
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,360
Did you see Li Yan?

797
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,230
No.

798
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,390
This girl.

799
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:37,880
She must sneak out to play.

800
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:39,520
It’s chaotic outside.

801
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,400
If she meets some treacherous people,

802
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:42,400
this is...

803
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:44,840
This troublesome girl.

804
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,120
Do we need our brothers
in Hengyang to find her?

805
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:47,930
No.

806
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:50,040
Madam specifically told us

807
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,000
that we should try to
keep a low profile.

808
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,520
It won’t be good if anyone
notifies the Secret Service.

809
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,910
Yan likes to have fun.

810
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:59,630
She must go to some busy place
on the street.

811
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:01,800
Take some people
and look for her with me.

812
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,470
-Let’s go!
-Yes. Hurry up.

813
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:21,700
You’re awake!

814
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:26,220
You should rest for more days.

815
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,500
Why would I listen to you?

816
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,130
Where am I?

817
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,950
This is my room.

818
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:35,380
I’ll let you live here for some days.

819
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:38,150
I shouldn’t

820
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:40,190
make the move rashly.

821
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:41,360
But it’s also your fault.

822
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,470
You looked down on me
and refused to fight with me.

823
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:44,600
After you get better,

824
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,760
please be sure to compete with me
in a serious way.

825
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,470
Are you sick?

826
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:49,560
You knocked me out first

827
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,870
and made all these explanations.

828
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:52,180
And you try to lock me up?

829
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,800
Compete what?

830
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,120
Send me home

831
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,260
while I’m not planning to
get back on you!

832
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:01,870
I’m talking to you!

833
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:04,080
Are you a descendant of South Blade?

834
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,430
When did I say I am?

835
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:07,040
Then why are you so clear about

836
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,210
Master Li’s personal life?

837
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,760
Because he is my grandfather.

838
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,950
You call him your grandfather.

839
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:13,840
And you said you are not
a descendant of South Blade.

840
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,040
You want to fool me?

841
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,600
He is my grandfather,
not your grandfather.

842
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,840
I can say whatever I want.
It’s none of your business.

843
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,390
Listen,

844
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:23,320
if you dare to touch me,

845
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,520
the entire Fortress of the Forty-Eight
will never let you go!

846
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,360
I don’t care!

847
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,280
