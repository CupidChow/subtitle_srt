00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,120
No! No! No! Don’t cry!

19
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,480
Be quite.

20
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,650
Other Demons might find us.

21
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,550
What are you here for?

22
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,590
When I was in town,

23
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,680
I saw Yu Wenzhi’s private army.

24
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,000
He is a man of noble blood.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,080
Why is his heavy army stationed
at Chunhui Town?

26
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,910
There is certainly something fishy
about this.

27
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,830
I was worried,

28
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,690
so I came back to take a look.

29
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,370
Who are you worried about?

30
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,270
None of your business.

31
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,260
It’s definitely not you.

32
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,550
Bonehead.

33
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,240
I’ve never thought that

34
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,020
I would be so happy to see you.

35
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,620
Don’t try to be smart.

36
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,390
I’ll leave you alone now.

37
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,270
Where are you going?

38
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,550
Wait for me.

39
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,000
Why did you leave the Fortress?

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,320
The Demons are plotting against

41
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,880
Fortress of the Forty-Eight
with Yu Wenzhi.

42
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,540
My brother asked me to deliver a letter
to look for help in the town.

43
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,800
Fine, I’ll go with you.

44
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,390
I’m not afraid of death.

45
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,690
Me neither.

46
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,520
Heaven bless us!

47
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,030
-Let’s just take them with us.
-Just die together.

48
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,390
Sister.

49
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,080
Haven’t you just said that
it’s dangerous out there?

50
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,320
Don’t go out.

51
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,600
I’m here to protect everyone.

52
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,870
You’ll be safer inside.

53
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,730
Young man,

54
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,960
it’s your responsibility

55
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,720
to protect everyone here.

56
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,880
I need to go out to
find some information.

57
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,670
I’ll be back soon.

58
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,030
When you grow up,

59
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,670
you can become a real man.

60
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,160
Then, you can protect the nation.

61
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,030
Okay?

62
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,700
Okay.

63
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,870
This is how we’re supposed to be.

64
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,270
We must not let the youngsters beat us.

65
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,300
Slow down.

66
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,360
Bonehead.

67
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,600
This is not working.

68
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,160
How about this?

69
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,440
That is the road to Chunhui Town.

70
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,520
You can go find Fei.

71
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,050
I’ll deliver the letter
to our secret service myself.

72
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,830
No!

73
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,880
How can you go there on your own?

74
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,750
I must go with you!

75
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,240
No way!

76
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,630
You’re a strong fighter.

77
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,750
You’re not afraid to die, too.

78
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,550
Fortress of the Forty-Eight

79
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,240
needs a man like you right now.

80
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,960
But...

81
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,470
But what?

82
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,880
My martial art is not as good as Fei’s.

83
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,590
But delivering a letter is an easy task.

84
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,500
No! No!

85
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,800
The Demons have their pawns everywhere.

86
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,550
What can you do

87
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,600
if they’re after you?

88
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,160
Besides...

89
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,190
Bonehead,

90
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,910
this is not the time to worry about me.

91
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,620
Who’s worrying about you?

92
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,350
I’m concerned only because

93
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,510
Fortress of the Forty-Eight
will be upset with me

94
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,240
if you get hurt.

95
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:25,710
Right.

96
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,790
That’s it.

97
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,160
Cut it out.

98
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,480
You’re the master of Cloud Ravine.

99
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,270
Why can’t you act like one?

100
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:32,840
Go.

101
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,880
Yang Jin.

102
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,530
Be careful!

103
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,760
Anybody inside?

104
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,540
You know what you should do, right?

105
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,450
Talk sense.

106
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,550
Go. Open the door.

107
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,650
Who’re you looking for?

108
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,620
Sir,

109
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,360
why isn’t there anyone outside?

110
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,060
Who’re you?

111
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,290
I don’t know you.

112
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,620
I’m from Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

113
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,090
I’m here to ask for your help.

114
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,450
This letter.

115
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,220
You must give it to
Lord Gantang, Zhou Yitang.

116
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:44,940
Tell him that

117
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,750
Fortress of the Forty-Eight
is under the siege of the Demons.

118
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,010
You’re talking to the wrong person.

119
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,850
I don’t know anyone from
Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

120
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,680
Sir, please help me.

121
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,340
Young lady,

122
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,660
where are you going?

123
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,060
What do you want?

124
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,130
We’ve been hiding around here for days.

125
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,100
We’ve found this place suspicious
early on.

126
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,100
You’re unfortunate
that we catch you today.

127
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,820
So, you’re the secret spy

128
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,250
sent from the Fortress.

129
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,380
You’re here to deliver this letter.

130
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,410
Why is this all blank?

131
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,980
What’s your trick?

132
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,060
Go.

133
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,250
Go now!

134
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,130
May you have all five luck in the world.

135
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,290
May I inquire

136
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,820
What color is the bat?

137
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,410
Actually, I’m not with the Route Gang.

138
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,060
I have an urgent matter.
I need to talk to Chief Xu.

139
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,130
My brother and Fei

140
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,540
must have sent me to deliver this letter

141
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,540
because they wanted to protect me.

142
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,060
I need to find help.

143
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,690
Report!

144
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:40,500
We’ve searched everywhere.

145
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,690
But we couldn’t find Li Sheng.

146
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:43,730
How’s that possible?

147
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,690
We must still be able to

148
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,450
distinguish his remains.

149
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,690
Maybe he has fallen into Ximo River.

150
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:49,970
What?

151
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,500
Sheng sacrificed himself to protect us,

152
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,900
to keep away the Demons.

153
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,820
How are we supposed to tell Leader

154
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,500
if we can’t even find his body?

155
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,310
Chuchu,

156
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,510
wait for me.

157
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,850
Those animals!

158
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,690
One day,

159
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,840
I’ll kill them all.

160
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,220
Commander, something went wrong.

161
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,380
Our spy at Fortress of the Forty-Eight

162
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,130
told us that

163
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,410
they have already sent out people to

164
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,050
ask Zhou Yitang for help.

165
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,180
Their reinforcements will arrive

166
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,830
very soon.

167
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,610
How can someone
leave the mountain successfully?

168
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,690
Lord Shen has the fortress surrounded.

169
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,250
Those from Fortress of the Forty-Eight

170
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,690
can’t get away from the main road.

171
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,050
Spinning Wire Formation of Ximo River
has their rear protected.

172
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,370
I suppose they won’t dare to

173
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,610
close the formation.

174
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,340
If those cunning bastards
don’t come out soon,

175
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,930
we have to fight our way in.

176
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,460
But Yu Wenzhi’s defense is impenetrable.

177
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,720
He has his private army
and Mingfeng Building.

178
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,050
We do not stand a chance

179
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,560
if we choose to fight our way in.

180
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,810
Xie Meimei,

181
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,180
you said that Yu Wenzhi
is prone to suspicion.

182
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,690
Spinning Wire Formation failed
last time.

183
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,340
It must have compromised
his faith in Kou Dan.

184
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,300
I’ve heard that there’s a secret path

185
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,400
behind Ximo River going downhill.

186
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,130
Why didn’t you tell us earlier?

187
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,660
It’s just hearsay.

188
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,690
I don’t know if it’s true or not.

189
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,220
Chief Kou,

190
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,730
you’ve been hiding important information
again and again.

191
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,930
What are you plotting?

192
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,610
Fine, Commander.

193
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,340
This is not the time to
fight against one of our own.

194
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,370
Lord is under the siege in the mountain.

195
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,780
Reinforcements from Zhou Yitang
might come at any time.

196
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,810
I think

197
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,810
if that happens, we’ll be screwed.

198
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,900
The most urgent matter right now

199
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,160
is to send out your help immediately.

200
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,800
People are most off guard at night.

201
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,900
We’ll strike then.

202
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,130
I’ll send people to help Lord Shen

203
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,830
right away.

204
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,580
Is there any news about Zhou Fei?

205
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,340
We’ve lost track of them

206
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,080
ever since they rescued the people
at the ancestral hall.

207
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,850
This is not right.

208
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,440
This is not right, everyone.

209
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,630
It’s not safe for me

210
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,510
to stay here anymore.

211
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:57,980
Ms. Kou,

212
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,300
we’re fooled.

213
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,250
Kou Dan.

214
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,980
It’s indeed you.

215
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:17,830
Leader,

216
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,050
what are you here for?

217
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,810
General Wen,

218
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,750
I’m here to talk with Yitang.

219
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,690
That’s very unlucky.

220
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,490
Lord Gantang left for
North camp yesterday.

221
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,050
You’ve been really busy recently.

222
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,010
How’s everything going in the camps?

223
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,740
The pressure is
from both inside and outside.

224
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,980
I first met Gu Tianxian

225
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,490
at Hengyang.

226
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,440
Now the enemies in the North
are getting restless.

227
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,450
If you need help, I can arrange someone

228
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,300
to deliver the letter
to Lord Gantang for you.

229
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,370
Leader,

230
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,900
take some rest in the camp.

231
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,970
No need.

232
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,340
Since the Demons have arrived
at Hengyang,

233
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,920
they’re not far from
Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

234
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,740
Safety comes first. I’ll go back now.

235
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,980
General Wen, goodbye.

236
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,090
Leader, take care.

237
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,930
Where has Yu Wenzhi been?

238
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,860
Don’t worry.

239
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,350
His disguise will crack soon.

240
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,340
What are you drawing?

241
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,740
Can’t you speak?

242
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,340
If you’ve successfully
sowed discord among them,

243
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,690
with Yu Wenzhi’s suspicious nature,

244
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,900
he will replace his current guards

245
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,740
who’re from Mingfeng Building

246
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,350
with his private soldiers
for the sake of safety.

247
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,420
You mean...

248
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,220
Yu Wenzhi will be at the place
where the Mingfeng guards

249
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,900
have been replaced.

250
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,930
Smart.

251
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,300
If he has replaced those guards

252
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,220
from Mingfeng Building,

253
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,490
our chance of capturing him

254
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,780
will be higher.

255
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,570
Ms. Kou.

256
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,540
It’s time for the shift.

257
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,900
Lord.

258
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,450
There are so many of them.

259
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,930
I’ll create some distractions
to cover you.

260
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,250
Don’t go! It’s too dangerous.

261
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,280
Take care of yourself.

262
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,340
Go after him.

263
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,050
Yes.

264
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:11,420
(Li’s Mansion)

265
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:21,940
(Li’s Mansion)

266
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,500
(Li’s Mansion)

267
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,780
Lady, may you have all five luck.

268
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,860
This is Route Gang’s Five-bat Token.

269
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,340
Take it with you when you travel.

270
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,300
Route Gang will take care of
everything for you,

271
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,930
from accommodation
to transportation.

272
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,250
My name is Huang Zifu.

273
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,860
I’ve been working undercover here
for a long time.

274
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,980
Chief Xu has given me the secret order

275
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,540
to stay at Yu Wenzhi’s place

276
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,860
and wait for you.

277
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,010
Chief Xu is also at Chunhui Town?

278
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,780
How did he know that
I’m looking for Yu Wenzhi?

279
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,060
I don’t know about that.

280
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:10,850
Thank you.

281
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,090
Second chief,

282
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,700
Commander-in-chief asked me to

283
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,330
give Lord Shen this present.

284
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,130
Report.

285
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,460
Yu Wenzhi’s private army has arrived.

286
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,540
We can have full control of them.

287
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,700
They come right in time.

288
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,900
According to our secret spies
in the town,

289
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,330
Kou Dan said that

290
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,000
there’s a secret path
leading into the Fortress.

291
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,730
Hou Zuo. Hou You.

292
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:20,970
-Yes.
-Yes.

293
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,250
Arrange a small team to find the path.

294
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,130
Surround their back.

295
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,130
-Yes.
-Yes.

296
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:27,940
Team number two.

297
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,850
Search the back.

298
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,540
Let’s surround them.

299
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,460
Report!

300
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,420
Report!

301
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,580
Yu Wenzhi’s private army is attacking.

302
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,580
They’re trying to take down the fortress
with Shen Tianshu.

303
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,780
That’s bad!

304
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,210
A lot of Demons have gathered
at the back.

305
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,130
We don’t know what they want.

306
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,330
If this keeps going,

307
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,300
we can’t guard the fortress.

308
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,820
Nonsense!

309
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,250
Whether they’re
plotting something or not,

310
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,700
I just don’t believe that

311
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,580
they can take down
Fortress of the Forty-Eight

312
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,540
with us, Qianzhong Sect, guarding it.

313
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,180
Everyone, listen up.

314
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,460
Everyone who can still move

315
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,460
must come with me.

316
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,460
We must fight them till our last breath.

317
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:10,940
Yes.

318
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,490
Let’s go!

319
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,460
Wait.

320
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,180
I’ll go with you.

321
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,300
Zhao.

322
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,610
Don’t go.

323
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,250
Just guard here.

324
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,540
You must take control of the situation.

325
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,540
Zhang.

326
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,010
The fortress is about to fall.

327
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:26,540
There’s no sense in
my giving command here.

328
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,010
What we can do now

329
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,420
is just take our chance.

330
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,330
Fine.

331
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,970
Let’s put our life and death behind.

332
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,330
Let’s fight them.

333
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,090
Zhang.

334
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,370
I’ll leave you to
defend the fortress gate.

335
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,970
I’ll inform Ma Jili to

336
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,420
take the rest of our people

337
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,730
to fight the Demons
at the back of the mountain.

338
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,300
We’ll catch them unguarded.

339
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,180
Great. That’s the way.

340
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,060
Zhang.

341
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:49,780
If...

342
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,610
If we can’t guard the fortress gate,

343
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,180
do as we’ve planned.

344
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,060
Shoot two whistling arrows in a row.

345
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,660
Inform Zhou Fei and the rest

346
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,850
to abandon the fortress
and flee for their life.

347
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,540
Sure.

348
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,540
Commander-in-chief, report.

349
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,780
Words came from the mountain.

350
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,660
Although the enemies
have burned Feihong Bridge yesterday,

351
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,180
their leader has been captured.

352
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:10,900
Lord Shen has arrived at the gate

353
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,730
and arranged the formation today.

354
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,730
This fortress

355
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,540
will definitely fall.

356
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,940
I don’t care about
Fortress of the Forty-Eight

357
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,460
at all.

358
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,300
I only want to revive Mingfeng Building

359
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,730
right now.

360
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,940
I hope you can really be so carefree.

361
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,900
-Catch him.
-Hurry.

362
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,850
Stop there.

363
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:01,840
Who are you?

364
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,300
I’m just a nobody.

365
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,700
Nobody?

366
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,580
Since when does a nobody

367
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,300
have such great footwork?

368
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:12,850
It’s just a small trick.

369
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,090
There’s nothing to brag about this.

370
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,460
Come.

371
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,330
Assassin. Catch him!

372
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,730
Lord Gu hasn’t returned till now.

373
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,060
Did anything happen to him?

374
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,940
There’s nothing to worry about that.

375
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,060
Have you finished replacing the guards?

376
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,780
Replacing the strong fighters
from Mingfeng Building

377
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,010
might not be a smart decision.

378
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,490
Really?

379
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,300
But I’ve just received words that

380
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,660
a secret man practicing
Mingfeng’s martial art

381
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,460
tried to catch me.

382
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,880
You have my utmost loyalty.

383
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
Even if I believe you,

384
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,970
can I trust every one of your pawns?

385
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,210
Report!

386
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,090
We’ve found an assassin nearby.

387
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,130
How did they find this place?

388
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,490
I’ll arrange reinforcement

389
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,850
to protect your safety.

390
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,700
So, you’re Zhou Fei
from Fortress of the Forty-Eight?

391
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,090
I’ve heard your name for long.

392
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,700
I expected you to be savage.

393
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,180
But you’re quite pretty.

394
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:13,250
Surrender yourself today.

395
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,130
The martial art of Giant Leopard

396
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:07,370
certainly lives up to its name.

397
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,090
I really admire you.

398
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:09,660
Go after him!

399
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:10,940
Catch him!

400
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,300
Giant Leopard,

401
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,210
this has been such a long pursuit.

402
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,460
You’ve done a great job.

403
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,250
Stop there.

404
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,300
He’s fooled us.

405
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,540
Let’s go back to commander-in-chief.

406
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,460
Let’s go.

407
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,210
Go.

408
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,370
You’re not from
Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

409
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,210
Who are you?

410
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,180
Tell me your name.

411
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,210
Tell you my name?

412
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,180
You don’t deserve to know my name.

413
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,300
You, a bunch of lowlifes.

414
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,360
How dare you act against
a man of noble blood?

415
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,090
No one can get out of
this yard today.

416
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,700
Yang Jin, why are you here?

417
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,370
I met Li Yan on the way.

418
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,330
She told me that
you’re coming to catch Yu Wenzhi.

419
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,060
She cried and begged for me to help you.

420
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,180
She’s so annoying.

421
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,330
I can’t go against her will.

422
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:48,940
Look.

423
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,180
I’ve brought help with me.

424
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,490
Miss Zhou,

425
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,820
I haven’t seen you for a while.

426
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,300
Thank you, Kou Dan.

427
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,780
You can leave the rest to us.

428
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,780
It’s really you?

429
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,820
Commander-in-chief.

430
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,420
This is her trick.

431
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,490
This place is not safe.

432
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,940
Come with me.

433
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,900
Let go of me.

434
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,420
How dare you betray me?

435
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,850
Commander, listen to me.

436
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:27,540
Back away.

437
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,250
Protect Commander.

438
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,730
Someone!

439
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,820
It seems that I’m faster than you again.

440
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,820
Girl.

441
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,300
You’re very brave.

442
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,970
I’m not brave,

443
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,540
nor am I a kungfu master.

444
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,330
My success today is

445
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,660
attributable to Kou Dan.

446
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,540
You’re so cunning.

447
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,540
This trick has sowed discord
that I can’t repair.

448
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,060
I didn’t expect that
I’d be defeated by you today.

449
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:34,090
It seems that you’re even smarter
than Leader.

450
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,010
I’m flattered.

451
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,180
You.

452
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,460
Will you retreat your army or die?

453
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,700
Girl, do you really believe

454
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:46,210
you can walk out in one piece today?

455
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,300
-Commander-in-chief.
-Commander-in-chief.

456
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,730
Yu Wenzhi.

457
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,460
You’d better behave yourself.

458
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,420
I might accidentally cut you.

459
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,420
Don’t say anything

460
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,780
other than answering my questions.

461
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,610
Don’t make any unnecessary moves.

462
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,660
If you hurt Commander,
even a little bit,

463
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,250
all the army will attack, and everyone
from Fortress of the Forty-Eight

464
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,730
will die a horrible death,
whether you believe it or not.

465
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:08,090
I surely believe it.

466
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,180
What else are you here for?

467
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,420
Aren’t we already
in the middle of your attack?

468
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,010
-Or are we having a feast?
-You...

469
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,370
Can we really survive

470
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:17,060
if Yu Wenzhi is not harmed?

471
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,180
A horrible death?

472
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,460
That’s just irrelevant right now.

473
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,970
Let me ask you again.

474
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,180
Will you retreat your army or die?

475
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,490
This South Blade is indeed
a good knife.

476
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:33,060
But you don’t seem to be a good person.

477
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,630
I didn’t expect that during my stay
at Chunhui Town,

478
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,060
the thing that impressed me most...

479
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:44,970
Back off.

480
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,870
Back off!

481
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:01,570
Thanks.

482
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,580
Weed Spirit.

483
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,780
Nice job.

484
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,580
It’s indeed him.

485
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,970
Hold it.

486
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,660
Hold it.

487
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:34,060
Prepare the arrows. Hurry.

488
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,300
-Yes.
-Yes.

489
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,970
The shield.

490
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:01,610
Shen Tianshu.

491
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,850
Bastard.

492
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,130
We haven’t seen each other for years.

493
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,540
Your look still disgusts me.

494
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,700
Chief Zhang,

495
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:11,420
your temper hasn’t changed a bit either.

496
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,820
Great.

497
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,660
Now that you’re here,

498
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,850
let’s fight until death.

499
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,330
Shoot! Kill him!

500
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,250
Chief, are you all right?

501
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:43,820
Don’t mind me.

502
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,970
Take the injured to get treated.

503
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,090
Okay.

504
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,490
Come.

505
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,060
Come if you’re not afraid of death.

506
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,130
Come.

507
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:28,460
Hurry.

508
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,010
Hurry.

509
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,610
Chief Zhang. Chief Zhang.

510
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:34,850
-Why are you here?
-Chief Zhang.

511
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,210
What’s going on at the back?

512
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,370
Shen Tianshu somehow knew

513
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,970
there’s a path at the back.

514
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,060
We’re losing the ground there too.

515
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,540
Where’s Zhao?

516
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,460
Why hasn’t he come back with you?

517
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,370
Chief Zhao

518
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,420
has been severely injured.

519
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,210
Hyah.

520
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,580
Hyah.

521
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,540
Aunt. Aunt.

522
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,210
Aunt.

523
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,540
Yan, why are you here?

524
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,460
Things went sideways
at Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

525
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,370
Mingfeng Building has turned against us.

526
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,060
The Demons have invaded

527
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,460
Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

528
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,580
Let’s go.

529
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:34,850
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

530
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:57,900
This way.

531
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,850
Don’t mind me.

532
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:01,330
Mr. Ma.

533
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,540
Miss Chuchu,

534
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,780
why are you here?

535
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,460
Go back.

536
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,330
Fortress of the Forty-Eight
might fall at any time.

537
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:13,330
I’ll fight with you.

538
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,700
This is dangerous, Miss Chuchu.

539
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,820
Yes.

540
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,180
You’re hurt.

541
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,850
Let me take care of you first.

542
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,400
It will hurt a bit.

543
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,970
Stay here, Miss Chuchu…

544
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,210
Crap.

545
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,900
Come. Let’s take them with us.

546
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,660
Tear Fortress of the Forty-Eight down.

547
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,770
Yes.

548
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,290
What happened?

549
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,220
Lord.

550
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,610
This is the horn for a truce.

551
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,700
Truce?

552
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,770
Report!

553
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:25,060
Report!

554
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:27,940
Lord.

555
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,810
Commander-in-chief ordered us

556
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,220
to retreat immediately.

557
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,050
Why?

558
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,560
Because he had been held hostage by
people from Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

559
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:46,420
Retreat. Retreat.

560
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:51,020
Great! Great! Great!

561
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,660
Retreat.

562
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,930
Ma.

563
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,810
What is this bastard

564
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,820
Shen Tianshu doing?

565
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,130
Chief.

566
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,290
Is that Fei?

567
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:25,960
Where?

568
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,980
Set up the formation.

569
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,770
-That’s Fei.
-Zhou Fei’s back.

570
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,370
That’s Fei.

571
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,940
Hurry.

572
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,050
So, you’re Shen Tianshu.

573
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,460
When I was in the dungeon,

574
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,940
I should have fed the cake

575
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,660
to the dog.

576
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:22,850
Kid,

577
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,500
you’re so disrespectful.

578
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,220
Fei,

579
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,880
I’ve retreated as you wish.

580
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,510
When will you release
Commander-in-chief?

581
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,260
I’ll release him, but not now.

582
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:39,610
Why should we trust you?

583
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,340
You have no other choices.

584
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,390
If you want us to perish together,

585
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,200
I won’t complain.

586
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,220
Wait.

587
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,130
The others can leave now.

588
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,420
But Kou Dan has betrayed

589
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,810
Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

590
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,660
She has turned against
her masters and ancestors.

591
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,730
She has abandoned her humanity.

592
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,800
Kou Dan must stay.

593
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,760
Betrayed my master?

594
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,940
The reason I’m like this now

595
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,420
is all because of the old loser.

596
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,770
She trapped me here
in this shitty place,

597
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,370
being isolated from the world.

598
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:45,570
Who have I really betrayed?

599
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,980
Ma Jili,

600
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,770
don’t forget my advice to you.

601
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,370
Chief Kou.

602
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,090
My disciples

603
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,980
told me when they returned
from the town,

604
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,850
they heard that Fei

605
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,130
has gotten herself in a lot of troubles.

606
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,290
You must remind her not to
mess around with the government.

607
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:02,700
I’m responsible for taking care of her.

608
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,980
I’ll definitely keep her safe.

609
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,610
You watched Fei and those kids

610
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,770
grow up.

611
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:08,660
If the government is onto them,

612
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,770
the whole fortress will be screwed.

613
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,420
That’s your fault then.

614
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,180
I know.

615
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:21,750
Go.

616
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:37,260
Fei has made up her mind to kill.

617
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,130
Ma Jili, do it.

618
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,260
Fei.

619
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,290
Actually,

620
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:38,220
I can get you out of here.

621
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,130
No,

622
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,700
I must not flee from

623
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,790
my own battlefield.

624
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,290
This item is more valuable than my life.

625
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,940
This item is about a promise
worthy of my life.

626
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,500
Give it to Chuchu for me.

627
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,090
Find someone trustworthy
to take care of this for her.

628
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,940
This is the key
to the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

629
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,700
This might be the most important key.

630
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,610
You know that

631
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:56,460
I’ve been investigating
the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

632
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,810
I know.

633
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,980
So I trust this one with you.

634
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,220
I need to use the other one

635
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,840
to stop them.

636
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,220
Ma Jili,

637
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,660
you said that Kou Dan is the traitor.

638
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,500
But what are you doing yourself?

639
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,660
Why did you do this?

640
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,020
Yu Wenzhi has royal blood in him.

641
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,050
If you kill him,

642
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,090
You’ll bring destruction to
Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

643
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,220
As a noble,

644
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:23,420
Yu Wenzhi harms the civilians wantonly,

645
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:24,900
and commits all sorts of wickedness.

646
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,530
What’s wrong if I kill him?

647
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,940
Fighters like us

648
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,500
rid the world of evilness,

649
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,220
save people from misery,

650
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,610
and bring righteousness to the world.

651
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:36,130
We don’t seek immortal fame.

652
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:38,610
We aren’t afraid of being misunderstood.

653
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,850
But we must not go
against the law of heaven,

654
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:42,500
the law of earth,

655
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,740
nor our own conscience.

656
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,420
That’s the motto of
Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

657
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,520
We’re not taught to be cowards.

658
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,460
I’m sorry.

659
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,010
I was being silly.

660
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:56,370
Cut the nonsense, Ma Jili.

661
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,330
How can I defeat Zhou Fei
if I don’t lie to you?

662
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:02,020
Kou Dan.

663
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,250
I’ll kill you.

664
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,570
You shameless traitor.

665
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,330
All the traitors of
Fortress of the Forty-Eight

666
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,180
will be killed by me today.

667
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,020
You’re no exception.

668
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:17,940
If I don’t kill you,

669
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,370
I can’t live with my conscience.

670
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:52,460
Fighters like us

671
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:55,940
rid the world of evilness,

672
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:00,920
save people from misery...

673
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:02,900
Fei.

674
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,290
Are you slacking off again?

675
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,420
Don’t even try to.

676
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,900
You must be diligent.

677
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,220
To be a righteous person,

678
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,090
you must live up to your conscience.

679
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:14,220
Fei.

680
