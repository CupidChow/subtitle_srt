You’re foul-mouthed.

18
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,870
I can’t wait to teach you a lesson,

19
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,040
bastard!

20
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,950
I’ll get them out

21
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,870
and be right back.

22
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,040
Sure.

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,910
Follow me.

24
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,400
Let’s go.

25
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,950
You’re dead!

26
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,800
Phoenix!

27
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,760
You think you can get away

28
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,080
just like that?

29
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,910
I... I’ve

30
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,080
explained everything

31
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,600
already.

32
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,320
All that is true.

33
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,110
Do you mean how unthankful

34
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,720
and ungrateful you are?

35
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,910
Were my brother still alive,

36
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,030
you... you’d be showing him disrespect.

37
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,630
Shut your pie hole!

38
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,910
Huo Liantao,

39
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,520
who are you

40
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,110
to lecture me?

41
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,270
Listen,

42
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,000
I can’t care less

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,800
about respect,

44
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,240
let alone your brother is already dead.

45
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,190
Were he not,

46
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,440
and standing right before me,

47
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,470
he couldn’t stop me

48
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,550
from killing you!

49
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,670
You...

50
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,190
Phoenix,

51
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,160
I’ve finished him for you.

52
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,110
You’re welcome.

53
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,520
Just give me the Seal.

54
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,470
Phoenix,

55
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,830
I heard there’s a quick guide

56
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,550
to the 100 Destructive Palms

57
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,030
but the side effect is
the older you get,

58
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,270
the weaker you become.

59
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,640
Better take care of yourself.

60
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,320
I don’t owe you

61
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,830
or Old Master Huo

62
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,720
anything.

63
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,510
Why risk your life?

64
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,790
You castrated dog!

65
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,000
That Seal belongs to the Huo family.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I will get it back.

67
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,200
Report!

68
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,670
Lord Chu,

69
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,390
someone helped The Third Prince escape.

70
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,000
I wonder

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,390
who is it

72
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,040
that got him out of my hand.

73
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,440
The Third Prince called him

74
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,550
Xie Yun.

75
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,790
Xie Yun?

76
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,640
It’s you, little prince.

77
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,950
Who’d know

78
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,720
I’d run into an old acquaintance’s son?

79
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,600
Help!

80
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,390
Your Highness. Your Highness.

81
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,110
-Go!
-Leave now!

82
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,640
Stop there!

83
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,390
Don’t!

84
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,110
Let him go.

85
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,110
Protect His Highness first.

86
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,000
Let’s go.

87
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,550
Thanks, Miss.

88
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,720
Xie Yun.

89
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Didn’t I ask you to leave?

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,110
Why are you back?

91
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,670
We got lost in the woods

92
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,880
and circled back

93
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,760
somehow.

94
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,110
Listen.

95
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,270
Follow the servants

96
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,510
in the Huos’ uniforms.

97
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,000
Just go with them.

98
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,110
I can’t.

99
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,110
This place is dangerous.

100
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,160
I can’t leave you two behind.

101
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,350
Your Highness,

102
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,270
never put yourself in danger.

103
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,760
Haven’t you learned enough lessons?

104
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,000
No.

105
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,600
What should we do now?

106
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,790
There’s no time to think.

107
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,510
It’s too dangerous for him to be alone.

108
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,880
Let’s escort him out first.

109
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,550
Sure.

110
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,920
Huo Liantao’s manor

111
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,000
is as odd as can be.

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,510
Better get out of here first.

113
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,140
(Huo’s Manor)

114
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,510
Where’s Ding Kui?

115
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,270
He’s inside.

116
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,830
We’ve got company.

117
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,790
You’re such a jinx

118
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,390
as your name Meimei suggests.

119
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,510
We’re like

120
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,390
crow bait now.

121
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,790
You’re right.

122
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,070
I hate to say this,

123
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,920
but what a small world!

124
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,550
What do you mean?

125
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,390
-You...
-I know.

126
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,390
I shouldn’t fight

127
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,600
or use my energy.

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,920
But Fei,

129
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,880
there are things

130
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,040
we must do

131
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,950
ourselves.

132
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,720
But... but there’s no key.

133
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,510
I know what to do.

134
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,880
Little prince,

135
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,000
what are you two whispering about?

136
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,150
You’re lucky

137
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,350
to have lived so long

138
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,110
with Bone-chilling in your system.

139
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
Look at you two lovebirds.

140
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,640
You don’t want to die, do you?

141
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,440
I’m sure you know

142
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,400
only one of us

143
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,590
can survive by the end of the day.

144
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,880
That’s bold.

145
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,030
Xie Yun.

146
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,710
Your Highness!

147
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,760
Your Highness!

148
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,670
Little prince,

149
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,520
no,

150
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,880
Your Highness,

151
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,080
the Chens

152
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,670
dethroned the Xiaos,

153
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,200
yet here you’re
serving your enemy’s son.

154
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
How stupid you are!

155
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,200
What about you?

156
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,030
You betrayed my father,

157
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,590
killed my uncle

158
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,880
and defected to the enemy.

159
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,880
How has Demons Manor

160
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,080
treated you?

161
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
Eunuch Chu, since you’ve recognized me,

162
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,880
it’s time

163
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,400
for us

164
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,000
to settle the score once and for all.

165
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,400
Bring it on!

166
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,470
The legendary Cloud-impelling Palm

167
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,080
is nothing

168
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,760
but a useless skill to me.

169
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,080
Your master

170
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,350
only made you weak and soft.

171
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,840
What now?

172
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,640
You think your soft skill

173
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,470
and borrowed energy

174
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,400
can beat me?

175
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,320
Your Highness!

176
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,280
Calm down.

177
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,230
Fei!

178
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:31,960
Your turn.

179
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,000
Not bad!

180
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,670
Interesting!

181
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,440
Who are you?

182
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,320
What’s your name?

183
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,280
A nobody

184
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,320
not worth mentioning.

185
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,550
It’s open!

186
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,030
Yes.

187
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,640
Found it.

188
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,960
Miss Zhou, look.

189
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,880
Why are you still here?

190
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,840
Go!

191
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,840
Zichen,

192
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,710
give me your weapon.

193
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,200
Your Highness!

194
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,880
Go back and study hard.

195
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,590
Don’t waste time on other things.

196
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,550
Xie Yun.

197
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,320
Go!

198
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,910
-Get him out of here.
-Let’s go!

199
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,760
No.

200
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,590
-Come!
-Xie Yun!

201
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,470
-Xie Yun!
-Let’s go, Your Highness.

202
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,320
Let me go!

203
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,030
Miss Zhou!

204
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,350
-Young Master.
-Xie Yun!

205
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,280
Let’s go!

206
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,910
Come on, Young Master!

207
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,760
Look how selfless you are!

208
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,110
Why didn’t you leave

209
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,840
with that girl?

210
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,670
She wouldn’t

211
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,200
even if I asked her to.

212
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,230
If you’re

213
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,880
reluctant to leave,

214
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,520
then stay.

215
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,230
Alright.

216
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,230
I can spare some time

217
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,080
for you.

218
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,960
Your Highness!

219
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,030
Your Highness, don’t worry.

220
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,910
Miss Zhou

221
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,670
won’t let anything happen to Mr. Xie.

222
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,840
Is that

223
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,670
Miss Zhou, Zhou Fei?

224
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,030
Yes.

225
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,150
The way she wielded the blade

226
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,550
was indeed

227
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,110
unforgettable.

228
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
Your Highness,

229
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,200
we should leave now.

230
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,350
Your Highness!

231
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,710
Let’s go.

232
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,400
Let’s go, Young Master.

233
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,530
Come.

234
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,320
I’ll kill you

235
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,200
at the cost of my life!

236
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,080
Eunuch Chu,

237
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,640
you’ll die here!

238
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,110
As soft as Cloud-impelling Palm seems,

239
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,080
it’s as powerful as I heard.

240
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,960
If we weren’t enemies,

241
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,640
this battle

242
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,320
would be the best

243
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,280
over the past 20 years.

244
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,880
Sadly,

245
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,320
you’re still poisoned.

246
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,710
You have

247
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,520
used your energy earlier

248
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,640
at the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

249
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,350
That poison

250
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,280
will only go deeper

251
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,230
and worsen your condition.

252
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,000
Soon,

253
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,200
your joints will freeze,

254
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,200
your veins will be blocked

255
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,400
and then...

256
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:57,200
All that is thanks to Hu Tianying.

257
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,910
Otherwise,

258
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,640
I would’ve been caught

259
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,200
at a disadvantage now.

260
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,030
How dare you provoke him!

261
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,030
You won’t

262
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,580
get out of here alive!

263
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,280
Who are you?

264
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,760
The sole heir to
the Big Medicine Valley,

265
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,640
Ying Hecong!

266
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,710
Hu Tianying betrayed us

267
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,230
and defected to Demons Manor.

268
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,430
Then you and Shen Tianshu
massacred all our members!

269
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:21,190
It’s payback time!

270
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,400
Thank you.

271
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,000
Hadn’t you weakened him,

272
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,110
I wouldn’t have caught him off guard.

273
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,560
Ying Hecong, you...

274
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,820
Fei...

275
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,710
Xie Yun!

276
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,680
Don’t go.

277
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,000
The mist is poisonous.

278
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,400
That’s called Condensed Dew

279
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,040
from snakes.

280
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,880
It can vaporize

281
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,470
in the air

282
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,800
into colorless and odorless poison.

283
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,830
During your fight,

284
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,950
Eunuch Chu has inhaled a lot of it.

285
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,110
The more skilled one is,

286
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,430
the quicker he or she dies.

287
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,590
Eunuch Chu,

288
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,760
you’re as good as they say.

289
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,950
You...

290
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,820
(Seal of Cautiousness)

291
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:25,880
Xie Yun!

292
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,160
Mr. Li,

293
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,350
there you are.

294
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,040
Are you alright, Madam Nichang?

295
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,040
I’m fine.

296
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,920
Have you seen that pig Ding Kui?

297
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,230
He’s injured tons of our people.

298
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,760
Master meant to kill him,

299
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,800
but he managed

300
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,920
to escape.

301
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,950
I’m glad you’re here,

302
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,640
or we’ll probably get lost.

303
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,310
Enough. This place is dangerous.

304
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,760
Let’s get out of here first.

305
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,830
Let’s go.

306
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,520
Sheng,

307
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,070
you’re out.

308
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,430
Who’s that, brother?

309
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,590
He’s really something

310
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,400
that he clobbered Ding Kui alone.

311
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,560
Hadn’t I stopped that bonehead,

312
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,680
he would’ve challenged him.

313
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,470
You...

314
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,680
You think I’m that stupid?

315
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,020
All these years,

316
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,180
I’ve never heard of such a figure.

317
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,180
Where’s Zhou Fei?

318
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,500
Isn’t she inside?

319
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,340
I thought you had found her.

320
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,660
She wasn’t there.

321
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,340
Probably left to seize those Demons.

322
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,260
We’d better leave.

323
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,580
Let’s go back to the inn

324
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,380
and ask the Route Gang to look for her.

325
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,900
Xie Yun! Xie Yun!

326
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,550
You...

327
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,740
I’m fine.

328
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,180
Don’t worry.

329
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,270
Take this.

330
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,740
What is it?

331
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,980
The antidote to the Condensed Dew.

332
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,980
You must’ve inhaled some, too.

333
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,340
I know

334
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,500
it’s the unwritten rule

335
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,860
that however skilled

336
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,020
and noble one is,

337
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,700
that person shall be condemned

338
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,420
for poisoning others.

339
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,860
It’s been three years
since I made this poison.

340
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,540
This is the first time I’ve used it.

341
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,700
Hadn’t you

342
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,660
cornered him first,

343
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,460
he would’ve spotted me

344
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,780
the minute I entered the woods.

345
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,620
Thank you

346
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,780
for helping me get revenge.

347
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,900
I owe you two one.

348
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,620
Why is there just one?

349
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,060
You want more?

350
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,980
He...

351
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,820
He doesn’t need it.

352
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,700
Bone-chilling he has

353
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,340
is the most toxic poison.

354
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,980
Nothing else

355
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,340
can hurt him,

356
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,900
including my Condensed Dew.

357
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,100
He can drink it like liquor

358
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,860
if he wants

359
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,040
and nothing will happen.

360
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,050
Mr. Ying.

361
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,740
Please don’t sugarcoat the fact

362
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,660
of being poisoned

363
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,970
by Bone-chilling.

364
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,020
Well,

365
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,060
I’ve already told you

366
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,700
that his days are numbered.

367
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,780
Unblocking his veins

368
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,180
by force

369
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,900
has only injured him more.

370
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,020
There’s no cure.

371
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,300
My hands are tied.

372
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,940
You...

373
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,900
You said you owe us one, didn’t you?

374
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,580
How are you going to repay us?

375
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,420
I will,

376
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,940
of course.

377
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,900
But it has to be within my ability.

378
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,940
Removing his poison

379
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,220
is not.

380
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,820
Hey,

381
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,940
you have one last option.

382
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,140
There’s a temple

383
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,260
one kilometer away.

384
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,540
You can go there to pray to Buddha.

385
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,180
Maybe that will work.

386
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,180
Aren’t you the heir
to the Big Medicine Valley?

387
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,020
You’re worse than a quack!

388
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,660
You’re useless!

389
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,940
I am the heir,

390
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,980
but I’m not a physician.

391
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,420
When master taught us medicine,

392
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,780
I always sneaked out to play.

393
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,740
Later on, all our medical books

394
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,740
were burned

395
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,380
by Hu Tianying and Chu Tianyu.

396
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,820
All that’s left

397
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,020
is me, a good-for-nothing.

398
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,220
I don’t deserve my title.

399
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,780
Is there anything else?

400
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,580
If not,

401
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,220
I’m leaving.

402
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,740
Fei,

403
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,020
everyone

404
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,940
will have to die

405
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,780
sooner or later.

406
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,820
That’s natural.

407
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,740
Where are you taking me?

408
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,220
To pray to Buddha.

409
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,640
You once said

410
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,940
if you were me,

411
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,100
even if you failed eventually,

412
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,100
you’d die with no regrets

413
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,580
and be able to

414
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,800
rest in peace.

415
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,710

Be brave.

418

Don’t cry.

419
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,020
Don’t forget what you said.

420
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,040
Shut up!

421
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,260
Fine.

425
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,100
Put me down

426
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,760
so that we can talk.

427
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,580

438
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,960
I wanted you to be my consort.

00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,540
you were poisoned?

525
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,460
The antidote was in your pocket.

526
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,060
Why didn’t you take it?

527
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,020
Were you

528
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,100
(Abbot Tongming Three Immortals of Penglai)
testing your life?

529
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,420
Were you?

530
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,340
He’s as sarcastic

531
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,270
as Xie Yun.

532
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,900
Xie Yun.

533
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,460
Where’s Xie Yun?

534
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,110
Slow down.

535
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,180
You people are always jittery.

536
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,140
Abbot,

537
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,100
where’s that man

538
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,780
with me?

539
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,060
Merciful Buddha.

540
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,740
Miss, where are you going?

541
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,900
I can give you a ride.

542
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,220
Where should I go?

543
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,460
What should I do?

544
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,750
Abbot,

545
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,420
do you have liquor?

546
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,340
That’s not in reserve.

547
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,220
A canteen is hanging on the mast

548
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,460
with boiled water.

549
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,420
Feel free

550
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,540
to drink it.

551
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,030
Medicine.

552
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,300
We’re no longer in Lingling

553
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,380
and will be soon

554
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:58,300
out of this area.

555
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,500
Where are you going next?

556
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,620
Lingling.

557
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,740
I should go back to the inn

558
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,460
to not let Li Yan and Li Sheng worry.

559
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,420
But then what?

560
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,260
Continue looking for that Bracelet?

561
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,060
But

562
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,280
he’s gone.

563
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,780
It’s fine if you don’t know.

564
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,740
Just don’t forget
why you came in the first place.

565
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,700
But

566
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,140
I’ve lost him.

567
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,420
No, wrong.

568
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,980
Let me help you.

569
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,980
Can you row?

570
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,620
I can learn.

571
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,980
How can I make this thing go?

572
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,900
Think again

573
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,940
what you’re here for.

574
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,460
Then you’ll know

575
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,180
where you should go next.

576
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,180
Does he know

577
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,940
what he’s talking about?

578
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,540
What happened

579
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,980
between you and that man

580
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,940
is only a chapter in your life.

581
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,460
An accident.

582
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,940
He can’t be

583
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,500
what you’re here for.

584
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,720
At first,

585
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,780
I set out

586
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,020
to run an errand for my parents.

587
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,780
No.

588
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,060
As far as I know,

589
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:20,140
an errand is independent.

590
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,460
When it’s done, it’s done.

591
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,380
It’s not the beginning or the end.

592
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,580
You’re here

593
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,660
for something else.

594
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,340
No.

595
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,060
I’ve never gone out before.

596
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,940
I used to practice my skills

597
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,500
at home.

598
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,140
There’s no beginning or end.

599
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,780
Practice your skills at home?

600
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,340
And why

601
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,140
do you do that?

602
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,740
It’s my passion.

603
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,340
Your errand is done

604
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,700
and you’ve found no one,

605
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,740
shouldn’t you go back
to pursue your passion?

606
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,620
Why did you say

607
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,820
you don’t know where to go?

608
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,380
What do you

609
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,700
practice those skills for?

610
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:17,140
Why do I practice those skills?

611
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,940
At first,

612
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,700
that was to gain Mom’s recognition.

613
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,140
And then...

614
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,420
This is the first life

615
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,460
the Snow-breaking Blade took

616
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:30,340
since it reappeared.

617
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,580
Even if I’m the only one left,

618
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,340
I’ll escort you back

619
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,260
to the Fortress.

620
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,420
Right after coming out,

621
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:43,940
when she saw Demons
attacking Huo’s Manor

622
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,340
she beat them back

623
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,020
on her own,

624
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,820
killed Blessed Dog

625
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,740
and fought her way out

626
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,780
to Mount Heng.

627
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,140
There,

628
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:59,060
she lured Dragon Master out

629
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,610
and killed him.

630
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,900
To...

631
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,740
To honor my grandfather’s blade.

632
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,340
The Blades, Sword, Palm’s time

633
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,780
is over.

634
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,340
We, as their descendants,

635
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,820
could barely

636
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,820
protect ourselves

637
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,740
with their weapons.

638
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,940
How shameful that is!

639
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,580
It shouldn’t be

640
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,060
like that.

641
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,140
You’re from a prominent family.

642
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,340
I almost forgot

643
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,020
about things at home.

644
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,900
Huo Liantao is gone.

645
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,100
Those thugs like Ding Kui

646
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,690
would become even more unscrupulous.

647
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,900
I need to go back

648
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,280
and tell my mom everything.

649
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,740
And that Bracelet...

650
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,660
Abbot,

651
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,740
could you put me

652
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,860
outside Lingling?

653
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,060
Go check in the cabin.

654
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,920
♪So lucky to get the wooden peach

662
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,140
Abbot,

663
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,220
can he be cured?

664
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,220
I’ve given him

665
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,260
acupuncture and medicine

666
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,500
to prolong his life.

667
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:52,540
As for how to remove Bone-chilling,

668
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,100
we’ve been working on it

669
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,280
since decades ago,

670
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,500
but to no avail

671
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,290
so far.

672
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,620
I knew the reappearance

673
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:09,140
of the Cloud-impelling Palm

674
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,740
was a bad sign.

675
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,260
So I came all the way

676
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,300
but

677
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,760
arrived late.

678
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:19,060
He seems to know Xie Yun.

679
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,260
Is he here especially for him?

680
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:23,850
Abbot,

681
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,700
may I ask your name?

682
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,500
Finally!

683
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,660
Think again.

684
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,880
What else have you forgotten?

685
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:42,660
I’m Tongming,

686
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,820
a nobody drifting from place to place.

687
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,820
I don’t think you’ve heard of me.

688
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,380
Tongming?

689
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,220
Never heard of it.

690
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,560
That little rascal inside

691
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,940
is my disciple.

692
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,140
That said,

693
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,700
unlike me,

694
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,520
he isn’t a monk

695
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,700
of any kind.

696
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,300
He did shave his head
when he was little,

697
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,620
but I knew he has burdens,

698
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,020
so I didn’t convert him to Buddhism.

699
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,620
Back then, nobody took him seriously.

700
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,300
He was bored

701
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,420
and returned to the secular world

702
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,300
a few years later.

703
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,140
Abbot,

704
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,060
now I see

705
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,180
why he’s

706
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,540
such a nagger.

707
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,820
Xie Yun once told me,

708
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,260
thanks to his uncle,

709
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,580
who transferred all his energy to him,

710
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,700
he didn’t die of Bone-chilling.

711
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,500
That was the only way

712
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,620
to stop it from spreading.

713
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:55,360
I gave him acupuncture
to suppress the poison.

714
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,020
I knew that was only

715
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,660
a temporary expedient.

716
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,740
And Anzhi was born

717
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,580
compassionate.

718
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,340
He wouldn’t turn a blind eye

719
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,500
to others’ suffering.

720
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,330
Anzhi?

721
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,500
That’s his courtesy name.

722
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,980
Didn’t he tell you about it?

723
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:21,540
He introduced himself as Xie Meimei.

724
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,940
When the mutiny broke out,

725
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,260
Anzhi was still in his infancy

726
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,860
and was taken out

727
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,460
by an old eunuch.

728
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,020
Then we found him on the way.

729
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,300
Master,

730
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,540
why can’t I be a monk?

731
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,180
You’re one

732
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,740
and so should I.

733
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,340
A monk

734
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,220
has to break free from his burdens.

735
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,380
Anzhi,

736
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,260
do you know what burden means?

737
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,500
If you ask me,

738
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,020
you’re too cowardly

739
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,660
to bear your burden.

740
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,700
Why should I?

741
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,140
I can’t choose who my father is.

742
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,180
If I could,

743
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,060
I wouldn’t be his son.

744
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,250
Whose son would you rather be instead?

745
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:20,780
A fisherman’s, a boatman’s, a porter’s

746
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,420
and so on.

747
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,980
Then I wouldn’t have to study

748
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:25,260
or practice martial arts.

749
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:26,620
When I grew up,

750
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,860
I could still make a living

751
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,180
by being a waiter or a carter.

752
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,140
The former could learn
all kinds of information

753
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,460
and the latter could explore the world.

754
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:38,100
Wouldn’t that be better?

755
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,940
Merciful Buddha.

756
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:43,780
Master,

757
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,540
am I wrong?

758
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,100
You’ve only seen

759
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:50,260
those kids on the beach
are living an easy life,

760
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:51,860
but you don’t know

761
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:52,940
that’ll only last for so long.

762
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,420
The rest of their lives

763
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,180
won’t be that easy.

764
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,500
Once they grow up,

765
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,740
they’ll start working
for their families.

766
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,660
They’ll have to carry goods

767
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:08,100
and punt boats day after day,

768
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,740
working from dawn to dusk

769
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:13,500
only to scrape by.

770
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,510
They can’t afford to rest or have fun.

771
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:20,940
Their families rely on them.

772
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,220
The burden is so heavy

773
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,500
that they can’t afford
to get sick or die.

774
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,340
The only choice is
to bow their heads and go on.

775
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,540
That’s in the good years.

776
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,780
In the bad ones,

777
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,540
the situation will be worse.

778
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:43,140
Only few can survive.

779
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,140
Do you know

780
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,410
what are they thinking?

781
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,700
Merciful Buddha.

782
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:58,180
They’re thinking

783
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:59,540
why

784
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,380
I wasn’t born into a noble family.

785
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,140
The world is even crueler to girls.

786
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:07,500
When they are little,

787
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,540
they pray not to be sold.

788
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,140
When they’re married
into other families,

789
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:15,100
they beg for their mercy.

790
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:18,260
They can’t control their lives.

791
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,260
As humans,

792
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,900
they’re as helpless as farm animals.

793
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:28,220
Do you know what are they thinking?

794
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,660
Life and death

795
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:34,140
are inevitable.

796
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,140
Most people spend most of their lives

797
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,540
trying to change their fate.

798
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,000
But that’s not easy.

799
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,860
You think your life is bitter

800
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:51,020
because you haven’t seen the worst.

801
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:52,820
Master,

802
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:54,960
is there a kind of life
that’s not bitter?
