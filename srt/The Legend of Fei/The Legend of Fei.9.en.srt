However, the man in front of me

is far better than I am.

23
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,310
You’re Li Zheng, the South Blade?

24
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,840
Exactly.

25
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,950
How did you know I was in danger?

26
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,190
I was just passing by.

Gladly I came in time.

28
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,030
Where are you going, Miss Duan?

29
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,800
Let me give you a ride.

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,800

00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,190
I was on my way to Huarong

34
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,000
and ran into

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,390
Mrs. Song and an infant being hunted.

36
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,000
I couldn’t sit by, so I helped.

37
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,000
Unexpectedly, they’re from Demons Manor.

38
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,800
If it were not for the infant

39
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,600
in my arm,

00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,550
I’d have kicked their asses.

I’m as good as you.

42
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,960
It’s surprising

43
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,530
the renowned South Blade is so gentle.

44
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,740

of your trip to Huarong?

00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,720
I have a twin sister.

67
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,670
She was lost when we were little
in the chaos of wars.

68
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,600
But I was informed

69
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,110
that she’s in Huarong.

70
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:30,850

reunite with your family.

00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:42,850
Mr. Li,

76
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,270
I envy you

77
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,720
that you have the Fortress
and a big family.

78
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,950
You’re welcome

79
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,510
to the Fortress at any time.

80
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,920
What’s your plan?

81
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,160
I’ve made up my mind.

82
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,040
I’ll take them with me to Huarong.

83
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,480
With our shared experience,

84
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,350
I’ll take good care of them.

85
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:12,950
Miss Duan, you have

86
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,090
a pure heart like pearls.

87
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,000
I’ll have nothing to worry about

88
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,850
with your words.

89
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,670
What a coincidence!

90
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,270
My favorite jewel is pearl.

91
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,190
Formed in oyster shells in a long time,

92
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,440
it’s rare, shining and rotund.

93
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,870
I’ll ready the cart.

94
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,700
Mr. Li.

95
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,280
Yes, Miss Duan?

96
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,160
Mr. Li, I...

97
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,850
To be honest,

98
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,750
though we just met,

99
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,770
you’re like an old friend to me.

100
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,160
In my heart...

101
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,770
In my heart, there’s love.

102
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,040
If you feel the same,

103
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,440
let’s get married.

104
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,500
What do you think?

105
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,490
Miss Duan,

106
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,920
I’m in my 40s.

107
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,540
My daughter is about your age.

108
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,350
If I didn’t make friends
with your peers,

109
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,110
with all due respect,

110
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,920
I would be an uncle to you.

111
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,320
Don’t joke.

112
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,610
I’m not joking.

113
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,070
I don’t mind if you’re

114
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:01,950
70 or 80.

115
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,280
Miss Duan,

116
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,580
I was married.

117
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,310
Though my wife passed away years ago,

118
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,670
I never stopped loving her.

119
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,600
I’m sorry I can’t accept your love.

120
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,540
Miss Duan,

121
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,440
you’re young.

122
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,040
Why waste your time on me?

123
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,670
Well,

124
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,820
it’s just my love to you.

125
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:42,230
Let’s go our separate ways.

126
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,440
Miss Duan,

127
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,990
I regard you

128
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,200
as a bosom friend.

129
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,130
That’s all.

130
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,080
I don’t know when we’ll meet again.

131
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,960
May you have a safe journey.

132
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,680
Take care.

133
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,030
Fei,

134
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,080
if you were Duan Jiuniang,

135
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,670
what would you do after being rejected?

136
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,840
How could I know?

137
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,710
She’s weird.

138
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,760
How is the baby now?

139
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,670
The baby’s been in poor health.

140
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,840
Luckily, Mr. Zhu raised her.

141
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,980
She’s married.

142
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,500
What about Jiuniang?

143
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,210
Would you like a fight with me?

144
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,780
I’m sure I can defeat your sword art.

145
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,500
Mr. Li.

146
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,190
Ms. Duan.

147
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,590
I told you I can defeat
Snow-breaking Blade.

148
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,790
Tell me.

149
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,220
Who taught you that?

150
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,490
My mother.

151
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,350
What could you learn from your mother?

152
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,700
She won’t train you hard.

153
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:38,760
Follow me.

154
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,540
(Deny Yourself Return to Propriety)

155
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,330
Ms. Duan,

156
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,200
I’m clumsy with half

157
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,760
of the nine moves
of Snow-breaking Blade.

158
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,590
If you find it plain,

159
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,670
the reason lies with my incompetence,

160
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,860
not the moves themselves.

161
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,670
You’re so nagging for a young girl.

162
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,750
As Li Zheng was.

163
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,390
Ms. Duan, forgive me.

164
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,280
Interesting.

165
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,110
This

166
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,250
is wind capturing.

167
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,320
Did you get it?

168
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,540
Got it.

169
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,460
Well, you’re poorer with

170
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,340
Snow-breaking Blade
than your grandfather.

171
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,240
What was that move of steps?

172
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,240
Mayfly Moves.

173
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,710
It seems Mayfly Moves are perfect

174
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,110
for Snow-breaking Blade.

175
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,520
You’re a little weak to practice

176
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,320
Snow-breaking Blade.

177
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,910
Stronger than Li Sheng.

178
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,560
He doesn’t even get the blade.

179
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,520
It’s alright.

180
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,670
I’ll take my time.

181
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,400
That’s right.

182
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,200
From now on,

183
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,520
you need to practice harder.

184
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,960
When I built forces in my early days,

185
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,030
dozens of my peers practiced together.

186
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,110
In the first year,

187
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,260
half of them died.

188
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,260
In the second,

189
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,400
over half of the rest died, too.

190
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,200
Three years later,

191
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,910
only five survived.

192
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,930
You know why?

193
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,230
How could I know?

194
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,760
Each month, my master transferred

195
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,820
forces to our bodies.

196
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,230
You don’t know the feeling.

197
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,080
It’s like your body

198
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,830
is going to explode.

199
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,800
At this moment,

200
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,790
you need to bear the pain

201
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,030
and do everything you can

202
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,760
to control the forces.

203
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,150
It took three years to build our bodies.

204
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,470
Another two years later,

205
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,540
there were only a senior and me.

206
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,370
So?

207
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,600
From now on,

208
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,430
learn from me, your grandmother.

209
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Yellow and Green Palm?

210
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,520
Yeah.

211
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,480
Like you said,

212
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,550
I’m poorer than my grandfather

213
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,880
and too weak.

214
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,280
I’m not proficient in blade yet.

215
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,590
Is it a little early?

216
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,300
Your choice.

217
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,880
A world’s top martial artist

218
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,440
as a county governor’s concubine.

219
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,470
What a pity!

220
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,390
Ms. Duan,

221
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,960
why don’t you

222
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,670
leave this damn place?

223
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,740
Come to the Fortress with me.

224
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,850
Come to the Fortress with me.

225
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,020
Come to the Fortress with me.

226
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,460
Li Zheng!

227
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,550
Li Zheng, get out!

228
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,030
Coward!

229
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,900
What a man are you to hide inside?

230
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,320
Be a man and meet my challenge.

231
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,780
If you don’t come out,

232
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,260
I’ll wait until you do.

233
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,370
Who are you?

234
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,620
How dare you make a fuss
at the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

235
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,960
and call Li Zheng’s name?

236
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,560
Judging by your appearance,

237
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,910
you must be Li Zheng’s daughter.

238
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,780
He brought you up once.

239
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,400
Young, but hot-tempered.

240
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,230
Who are you? Answer me.

241
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,570
Why are you here?

242
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,350
Don’t be rude.

243
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,550
We’re about the same age.

244
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,000
But perhaps,

245
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,280
you need

246
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,790
to call me,

247
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,500
Mother.

248
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,560
Crazy woman.

249
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,520
If you run your mouth again,

250
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,800
there’ll be consequences.

251
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,640
Good.

252
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,520
I wonder what consequences I’ll have.

253
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,880
Jinrong.

254
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,790
Stop.

255
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,060
Mr. Li.

256
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,370
Miss Duan,

257
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,650
why are you making a scene?

258
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,570
I’m not making a scene.

259
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,000
I’m challenging you.

260
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,920
Are you taking the challenge?

261
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,500
Alright. Come at me.

262
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,760
Why didn’t you draw your blade?

263
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,150
Are you looking down on me?

264
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,380
Or are you afraid of losing your fame?

265
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:27,980
Alright.

266
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,470
As you wish.

267
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,170
I don’t need your hand.

268
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,750
Mr. Li.

269
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,070
What move is that?

270
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,460
Edgeless.

271
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,380
Edgeless?

272
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,580
Edgeless?

273
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,950
Alright.

274
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,640
I’ll break your Edgeless.

275
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,830
You’ll see.

276
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,180
Father,

277
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,830
this woman is so unreasonable.

278
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,470
If she comes again,

279
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,110
I’ll kick her away for you.

280
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,120
You’re no match for her.

281
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,630
She’s proficient
at Yellow and Green Palm.

282
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,110
You’d better have her watched

283
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,290
in case she does anything stupid.

284
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,620
Windless in the open field.

285
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,840
Then I’ll make it no longer windless.

286
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,430
Capture the wind.

287
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,450
I’ll break your Edgeless.

288
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,430
Did she remember anything?

289
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,560
Li Zheng, the South Blade

290
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,190
doesn’t deserve his fame.

291
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,230
You can defame anyone else,

292
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,040
but not Mr. Li.

293
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,220
Mr. Li?

294
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,130
Sounds intimate.

295
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,580
Are you his mistress?

296
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,530
Come again?

297
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,590
What can you do about it?

298
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,560
Watch out.

299
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,280
You’re poisoned. Try not to move.

300
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,350
Or you’ll die faster.

301
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,920
Twining Thread.

302
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,640
Are you Pathetic Clam?

303
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,110
It’s me.

304
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,040
You think I would

305
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,190
be afraid of a tiny needle?

306
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,840
No need to fight her.

307
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,350
Inform the Fortress of the Forty-Eight
with this chess piece.

308
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,760
Make sure Li Zheng gets the news

309
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,040
that Duan Jiuniang is poisoned.

310
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,830
Mr. Li.

311
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,830
Are you alright?

312
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,590
I’m fine.

313
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,960
Miss Duan,

314
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,230
why did you pick at those
from Demons Manor?

315
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,540
Mr. Li,

316
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,960
I thought

317
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,250
I wouldn’t make it

318
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,470
and wouldn’t have a chance

319
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,790
to take my pearl back from you.

320
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,430
I’m so happy

321
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,380
that you came

322
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,290
and saved me with your forces.

323
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,820
Don’t mention it.

324
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,400
Why can’t you admit

325
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,590
that you have feelings for me?

326
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,200
You do love me, Mr. Li.

327
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,110
You have grudges with them.

328
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,710
Why can’t you restrain yourself

329
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,340
and save the troubles?

330
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,470
If I were a little late,

331
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,540
you’d be dead by now.

332
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,700
For the last time,

333
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,200
we won’t be lovers

334
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,720
ever.

335
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,430
You know my capability.

336
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,740
How could I eat dirt?

337
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,880
Who are you to me

338
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,180
to give this reprimand?

339
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,520
I was too careless this time.

340
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,680
If, one day,

341
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,590
I’m to be killed on street,

342
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,340
I won’t ask for your help.

343
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,580
(Deny Yourself Return to Propriety)

344
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,000
Ms. Duan.

345
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,020
Why would I go to the Fortress?

346
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,520
To be a widow?

347
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,620
You finally got it.

348
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,010
Got what?

349
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,000
In the vast world,

350
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,280
why would I go to the Fortress?

351
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,710
Away from the outside,

352
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,830
you hole up here.

353
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,540
Why would I go with you?

354
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,760
Yeah.

355
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,730
Why?

356
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,940
I can’t win anyone with my blade.

357
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,520
It’s hard for me to get out.

358
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,920
Why would she go with me?

359
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,160
What are you doing?

360
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,350
Fei!

361
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,590
Fei!

362
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,190
Miss Zhou!

363
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,350
Ms. Duan.

364
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,710
What are you doing?

365
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:25,350
Giving her the Yellow and Green Spirit.

366
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,800
There are two types

367
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,400
of the spirit.

368
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,920
My stubborn master won’t give us both.

369
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,560
Mine

370
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,800
-is the yellow one,
-Fei!

371
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,000
like withered leaves in strong wind

372
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,160
and surging torrent in the estuary.

373
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,400
Let’s see if her power channels

374
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,160
can hold the vital forces.

375
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,950
Come on. Get up.

376
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,160
-What did you learn?
-Easy.

377
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,160
Which weapon do you use?

378
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,760
Which school are you from?

379
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:54,710
Hey!

380
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,950
You guys from the righteous sects

381
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,350
are so rigid.

382
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,760
You teach the disciples

383
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,020
we practice martial arts to keep fit.

384
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Isn’t the purpose

385
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,800
of martial arts to survive in crisis?

386
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,470
Without this spirit,

387
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,470
what’s its difference

388
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,860
with acrobat?

389
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,180
Answer me.

390
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,000
You keep silent again.

391
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,720
Ms. Duan,

392
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,680
after all, Fei

393
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,760
is Mr. Li’s granddaughter,

394
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,120
a junior to you.

395
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,640
Are you sure you want her to suffer?

396
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,740
Please save her.

397
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,250
You’re right.

398
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:35,760
But my hands are tied.

399
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,950
The Spirit is in her body

400
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,590
and cannot be withdrawn.

401
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,740
It’s up to her.

402
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,680
If she’s Mr. Li’s descendant,

403
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,720
she should be able to endure it.

404
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,230
If she’s a useless loser,

405
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,000
it’s better that she dies here

406
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,730
than being killed by others.

407
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,340
(Stable as Mount Tai)

408
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:09,900
Lord,

409
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,880
the news of Chen Zichen

410
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,400
being trapped in Huarong is out.

411
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,930
We got news from Lord Tong

412
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,830
that Huo Liantao

413
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,040
is preparing for a move.

414
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,800
Good.

415
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,830
As I expected,

416
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,470
he’s still here.

417
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,560
It’s a surprise

418
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,410
Huo Liantao is willing

419
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
to be at Chen Zichen’s beck and call.

420
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:38,690
Then I’ll give him a surprise.

421
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,230
Pass my order.

422
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,640
Leave a squad here

423
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,070
in Huarong.

424
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,830
The rest of you, come with me

425
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,390
to Huo’s Manor.

426
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,430
Aye, Lord.

427
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,680
-Your Highness,
-What’s the news?

428
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,190
Mr. Xie,

429
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:54,400
Timber Wolf is going out of town.

430
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,160
Good. It’s our chance.

431
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,160
Come with me.

432
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,680
Have you found

433
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,280
that they wear masks

434
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,160
and identify each other by tokens?

435
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,110
Take a break.

436
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,800
We’ll soon set out.

437
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,640
Hou You,

438
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,470
take a squad and stay behind.

439
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,710
I got other assignment for you.

440
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:21,930
Sure.

441
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,790
Come with me.

442
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,950
The rest go with me and Lord Shen

443
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,430
to Huo’s Manor after the break.

444
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,590
Jiachen,

445
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,830
when one’s alone,

446
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,430
kill him

447
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,520
and go out in his identity.

448
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,680
Aye, Lord.

449
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:01,860
(Huarong)

450
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,180
(Fresh Flowers)

451
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,560
When Timber Wolf leaves,

452
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,520
Mr. Bai will swoop in

453
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,560
and kill Qiu Tianjin’s hounds.

454
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,680
Mr. Bai, please improvise

455
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,230
in the disguise

456
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,710
of Shen Tianshu.

457
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,430
Look.

458
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,400
Come on.

459
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,470
Who is it?

460
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,130
-Lord.
-Lord.

461
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,080
Do you have any orders?

462
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,110
In that case,

463
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:38,950
Qiu Tianjin will find his men

464
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,780
disappear mysteriously.

465
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,740
He’ll investigate it in the city.

466
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,480
When he finds out it’s Shen Tianshu,

467
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,920
they will certainly fall out.

468
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,070
-Be honest with it,
-We really don’t know.

469
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,310
or I’ll kill you.

470
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,280
-Please.
-Don’t kill me. Mercy.

471
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,710
Lord,

472
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,000
our men’s bones are fractured.

473
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,880
And nothing strange

474
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,720
was found on their facial expressions.

475
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,560
That being said...

476
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,820
Shen Tianshu,

477
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,020
how dare you kill my men?

478
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,710
Your Highness.

479
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,230
As Mr. Xie expected,

480
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,000
Qiu Tianjin is uneasy

481
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,830
and suspicious of Timber Wolf.

482
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,830
But so far,

483
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,590
the deployment of the gate guards

484
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,370
is unchanged.

485
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,710
The gate guards

486
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,760
will focus on people trying to escape.

487
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,160
But they won’t check their peers.

488
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,890
In their mindset,

489
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,220
Blessed Dog has cleared the moles.

490
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,430
They believe no one would

491
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,870
use the same plot again.

492
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,680
As for the soldiers,

493
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,980
they won’t check thugs

494
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,760
from Demons Manor.

495
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,550
Because they’ve noted the governor,

496
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:36,760
who

497
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,040
would give anything for you to leave.

498
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,680
You offer free porridge to refugees.

499
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,280
It’s considered to be a favor to him.

500
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,000
So he would hope you to leave safe.

501
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,680
The governor

502
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,580
isn’t a bad man.

503
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,590
We can’t choose where we live

504
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,000
but we can choose what a life to live.

505
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:57,900
Zichen,

506
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,460
this is the best chance
when you can get out.

507
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,780
You don’t devise the strategy

508
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,800
just for my sake,

509
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,800
but also to take revenge

510
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,520
on Demons Manor

511
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,800
for your friends died in the inn,
do you?

512
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,800
General Wu Fei’s families

513
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,280
are loyal and heroic.

514
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,970
I can’t let them swallow the insult.

515
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,590
You and I are as close as brothers.

516
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,190
I’ll clear up the mess for you

517
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,760
even if it’s life-threatening.

518
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,800
One stone, two birds.

519
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,460
Why not?

520
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,920
You’re not a gorgeous lady.

521
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,520
Please

522
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,010
don’t ask such stupid question anymore.

523
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,520
Right. Thank you, Yun.

524
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:42,800
Zichen,

525
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,020
I took care of you when you were little.

526
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,970
I didn’t learn much in the last years.

527
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,680
Just something superficial.

528
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,460
So a piece of advice.

529
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,490
Don’t get involved
in the martial circle.

530
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,160
Go back to your father.

531
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,300
Focus on study and governance.

532
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,710
Yun,

533
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,660
you should know

534
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,520
the struggle in my family

535
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,880
is complicated.

536
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,940
Only you can help me.

537
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,680
If you promise to help,

538
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,040
the cause here

539
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,710
will be ours...

540
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,270
Zichen,

541
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,010
mind your tongue.

542
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,840
Alright.

543
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,040
You don’t want anything to do with it.

544
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,360
Doesn’t it hurt you

545
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,840
to see the people lose their homes

546
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,910
and become the spoil

547
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:19,840
of endless wars?

548
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,620
We’re different.

549
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,150
At present,

550
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,440
all parties barely maintain a balance.

551
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:29,800
My return

552
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,370
will surely spark unrest.

553
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,470
More lives will be lost

554
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,450
and more suffer will come.

555
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,080
If you said so,

556
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,280
I won’t keep persuading.

557
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:45,480
Yun,

558
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,250
you’ll be alone here.

559
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,650
Take care of yourself.

560
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:54,040
Thank you.

561
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:56,900
Mr. Bai.

562
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,670
Yes.

563
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,470
Stay behind

564
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:01,040
and help for a couple of days.

565
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,540
Yes.

566
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,560
Do not turn me down.

567
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,750
I’d like to thank you
for saving my life.

568
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:08,930
Alright.

569
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,150
Zichen, bless you.

570
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,590
Take care.

571
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,150
Stop!

572
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,280
Who are you?

573
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:48,950
Don’t you know

574
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,320
no one leaves without a permit?

575
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,690
I’m asking you.

576
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,520
Guys, he’s trying to escape.

577
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:00,910
Get them.

578
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,040
They went that way.

579
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,630
-Go now!
-Move! Move!

580
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:10,580
-Hurry!
-Get them!

581
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,900
(Huarong)

582
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,220
(Huarong)

583
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,430
Go, go, go. Get them!

584
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,800
They went that way.

585
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,000
Go! Get them.

586
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,560
Madam,

587
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,840
didn’t the other men agree

588
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,880
to meet up

589
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,520
at the rendezvous nearby?

590
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,630
We’ve been on the journey for two days,

591
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,740
yet there’s not a soul.

592
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,420
Perhaps,

593
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,480
they’re caught up.

594
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,150
Let’s get

595
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,040
to the closest safe house

596
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,300
and wait for them.

597
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,710
Men from Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

598
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,520
Bloody Cricket’s token.

599
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,840
Father!

600
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,500
He must be Tong Tianyang,

601
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,120
the man who killed my father.

602
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,430
Sheng, calm down.

603
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,950
He has followers.

604
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,630
We’re outnumbered.

605
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,670
It’s not a good time to attack.

606
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,470
Wei Wu,

607
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,870
take the men

608
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:15,360
and keep searching around Huarong.

609
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,190
My...

610
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,280
My wound isn’t healed.

611
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,920
I can’t go fast.

612
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,600
I’ll head to Huo’s Manor

613
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,370
and wait for our lord.

614
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,160
Yes.

615
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,760
Everyone,

616
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:30,880
come with me.

617
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,710
Good opportunity.

618
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:46,560
I’ll kill you for my father.

619
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,230
My lord.

620
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,040
Who is he?

621
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,470
The governor.

622
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,150
Jiuniang,

623
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,880
it’s your sister’s death anniversary
tomorrow.

624
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,400
But men from Demons Manor
gather in the city.

625
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,010
I’m gonna be busy.

626
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,360
Can you please

627
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,630
go to her tomb for me?

628
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,000
Me?

629
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,150
On that day each year,

630
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,480
you go and visit her.

631
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,060
My sister

632
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,140
would be so grateful to you.

633
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,020
If I go this year,

634
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,560
my sister will be happy.

635
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,420
I’ll go.

636
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:46,160
You seem happy lately.

637
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,270
Of course.

638
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,850
I have visitors to have fun with me.

639
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,000
Fei.

640
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,330
Shh.

641
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,950
Hold on.

642
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,390
Blooms and swallows

643
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,630
are your friends.

644
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,710
How I envy

645
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,560
such a life!

646
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:32,000
My lord, visitors from Demons Manor.

647
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,840
Let’s go.

648
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,430
Jiuniang seems happy lately

649
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,520
and has a good appetite.

650
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,430
From now on,

651
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,390
send more food to her place.

652
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:46,860
Yes.

653
00:40:58,870 --> 00:40:59,940
Sheng.

654
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,600
Sheng.

655
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,260
Where is he?

656
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,550
Sheng.

657
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,550
Where did he go?

658
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,390
Hong Yun,

659
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,430
Sheng is gone.

660
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:16,350
Find him.

661
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:17,710
Yes, Madam.

662
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,870
Murderer,

663
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:57,870
you plot your wound?

664
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:00,600
You’re just a callow loser.

665
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,910
Yes, I cheated you.

666
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,210
What can you do?

667
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,520
You will meet your end.

668
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,670
Brat,

669
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:41,800
you’ll meet your end.

670
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,360
Old fool,

671
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,390
are you blind

672
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:58,910
stepping in my way?

673
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:19,950
Lord.

674
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,210
Shen Tianshu.

675
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,390
You must be the widow

676
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:28,230
of Xiaoxiang Sect’s leader.

677
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:31,040
Well,

678
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,840
it’s a pleasure

679
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,880
to meet you today.

680
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:40,260
I have no interest in your business.

681
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,800
Leave the disciple alone

682
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,900
and there’ll be no troubles.

683
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:46,430
I

684
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:47,970
will not be in your way.

685
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,430
But what I’m going to do

686
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:55,060
has to be kept absolutely confidential.

687
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,840
Madam, don’t blame me.

688
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,670
It’s not your lucky day.

689
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:51,630
Madam.

690
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:53,950
Sheng, go!

691
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:55,360
Don’t worry about me. Run!

692
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,360
Go!

693
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,190
Run!

694
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,190
Is this the end?

695
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,280
Yes. Even if I have to die,

696
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,800
Sheng has to be safe.

697
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:17,960
Madam.

698
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,120
I can’t protect you anymore.

699
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,150
I let the Leader down.

700
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,630
Go! Run!

701
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:39,530
