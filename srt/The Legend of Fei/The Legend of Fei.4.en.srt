After taking it,

19
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,100
someone with great force is needed

20
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,380
to help people to digest it.

21
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,470
Mr. Li.

22
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,940
For me, did you...?

23
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,310
Regardless of his own safety,

24
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,310
his gain and loss

25
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,700
and old grudges,

26
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,100
he saved us.

27
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,260
If you want to retire from your jobs,

28
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,430
why don’t you just stay?

29
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,240
We’re nothing,

30
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,730
but paid spies.

31
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,710
We’ve offended many people.

32
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,260
If we join you,

33
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,600
we may bring disgrace

34
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,870
to the reputation of you
and the Fortress.

35
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,640
Don’t bother.

36
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,870
If people like to gossip,

37
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,390
let them be.

38
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,860
I don’t care at all.

39
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,620
A man like him

40
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,820
is exactly a hero to me.

41
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,000
So,

42
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,350
we’d like to protect

43
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,260
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight for him

44
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,440
until we die.

45
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,630
With our lives,

46
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,630
we’d like to protect Ximo River

47
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,180
and the Spinning Wire Formation.

48
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,200
I, Li Zheng, the South Blade,

49
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,280
officially invite you

50
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,890
to join us.

51
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,000
Recently,

52
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,370
I find your granddaughter

53
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,760
very fierce.

54
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,740
In the future,

55
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,490
she may be more powerful

56
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,260
than you.

57
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,790
She isn’t an ordinary girl.

58
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,270
She’s lucky.

59
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,580
Brother! Fei!

60
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,580
Fei.

61
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,720
I don’t want to leave you.

62
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,120
Could you take me with you?

63
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,610
We’re going on a mission.

64
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,180
Take me with you.

65
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:57,670
You...

66
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,720
Go bother my mother.

67
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:06,700
We gotta go.

68
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,980
Sir, here’s your tea.

69
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,340
Mr. Zhang.

70
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,170
Huo’s Manor is right ahead.

71
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,360
-Let’s have a rest here.
-Why did they suddenly change the route

72
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,900
and stay here for such a long time?

73
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,510
Fine, then. Thank you.

74
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:53,720
You!

75
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,440
What exactly is Huo’s Manor

76
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,440
up to?

77
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,670
Ms. Wang.

78
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,560
This pawnshop is

79
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,040
one of our secret services.

80
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,990
We usually shuttlecock letters

81
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,280
through this place.

82
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,440
Get in the carriage first.

83
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,660
I’ll go get it ready.

84
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,490
Okay.

85
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,730
Don’t you want

86
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,730
to go for a walk?

87
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,540
Someone told me

88
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,680
people at the foot of the mountain
have little food to eat.

89
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,140
Seems like I’m cheated again.

90
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:08,120
Because we’re in Chunhui Town.

91
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,510
So what?

92
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:11,740
Chunhui Town is within the jurisdiction

93
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,080
of Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

94
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,000
Many of their families still live here.

95
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,210
When you go farther,

96
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,220
you’ll know

97
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,560
you aren’t cheated.

98
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,130
Isn’t it your first time to come down?

99
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,550
Why do you always

100
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,640
keep your eyes closed?

101
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,570
I’m practicing Eye-shutting Skill.

102
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:46,450
I only heard of Mouth-shutting Skill.

103
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:47,960
I guess Fisherman copied it,

104
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,560
without a sense of shame.

105
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,990
He called this odd practice method

106
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,560
Eye-shutting Skill.

107
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,310
Why didn’t Aunt tell me about it?

108
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,870
Because Fisherman thinks

109
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,780
I’m stupid

110
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,540
with poor martial arts.

111
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,080
I am bad at flying skills

112
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,450
and I’m so careless.

113
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,030
Besides being good at risking my neck,

114
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,580
I only have a good-looking face.

115
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,580
I must protect my face well,

116
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,630
instead of having any scar.

117
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,960
Whenever I’m stuck
in the center of the river,

118
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,340
he asks me to sit and meditate
with my eyes shut.

119
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,020
I keep depicting all skills in my mind.

120
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,020
As time passes,

121
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,900
I’m not sure if I’m really practicing it

122
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,790
or just imagining it in my mind.

123
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,310
But skills practiced with my eyes shut

124
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,270
are as good as those I truly practiced.

125
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,880
When Aunt kept you that day,

126
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,800
did she teach you Snow-breaking Blade?

127
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,590
She showed me once.

128
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,670
Would you like to see it?

129
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,100
I can show you.

130
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,340
I don’t want to see it.

131
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,090
Fei. Sheng.

132
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,420
There’s no news about Chenfei
in several secret services.

133
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,190
I’m afraid he’s still held up
in the enemy base.

134
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,490
Let’s go.

135
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,770
I’ve heard

136
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,460
Phoenix Mu Xiaoqiao

137
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
came to the Dongting Lake

138
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,380
after she left Four-guardian Mountain.

139
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,330
Why does Huo Liantao lock up
these martial artists?

140
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,080
Why is a decent sect like you

141
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,420
related to such a woman

142
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,580
like Mu Xiaoqiao?

143
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,870
And why are you locking us up

144
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,200
in this place without a reason?

145
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,720
Don’t you fear

146
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,180
you’ll arouse the anger of the masses?

147
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,510
(Huo Liantao, Huo’s Manor)
In turbulent days,

148
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,810
there’s no good or evil,
only friends and enemies.

149
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,180
Take him away!

150
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,690
-Aye.
-Aye.

151
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,660
Where is Old Master Huo?

152
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,780
Lord.

153
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,390
I heard

154
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,850
Huo’s Manor had built a dungeon

155
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:23,930
in the mountains

156
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,860
and had imprisoned many martial artists.

157
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,180
No one knows what they’re up to.

158
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:34,340
Do you remember Wu Fei’s letters?

159
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:35,910
Yes.

160
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,530
Those letters were delivered

161
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,310
through Huo’s Manor.

162
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,310
It’s wise of you, Lord.

163
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,070
Go.

164
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,870
Go to the dungeon of Huo’s Manor.

165
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,260
(Daran Restaurant)

166
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,070
Boy.

167
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,170
Here’s something to eat.

168
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,990
Take it.

169
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,490
What are you doing?

170
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,460
Go away!

171
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,160
Sheng.

172
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,050
What happened?

173
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,170
I don’t think

174
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,810
we’re welcome here.

175
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,950
Well, don’t bother them, then.

176
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,280
Let’s spend the night
somewhere isolated.

177
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,200
After we set out early tomorrow morning,

178
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,710
we’ll arrive at Huo’s Manor.

179
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:17,760
Okay.

180
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,720
Bandits! Come out!

181
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,720
Someone is calling us bandits!

182
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,140
Go and take a look.

183
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,250
Bandits! Come out!

184
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,090
Explain to us.

185
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,110
What are you shouting about?

186
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,430
Come out! Bandits!

187
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,490
Come out! Come out!

188
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,620
Everybody, we’re just passing by.

189
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,050
Have we broken any rule of yours?

190
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,850
You robbed us of food.

191
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,480
But why did you kill my son?

192
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,600
Killed your son?

193
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,940
No, we didn’t kill anyone.

194
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,090
There must be some misunderstanding.

195
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,360
Don’t bother to argue with them!

196
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,320
Today, we will fight desperately

197
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,450
with you!

198
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,410
-Fight desperately with you!
-Fight desperately with you!

199
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,060
Everybody!

200
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,140
-Fight desperately with you!
-Pay with your life!

201
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,040
-Fight desperately with you!
-Fight desperately with you!

202
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,110
You!

203
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,890
Fight desperately with you!

204
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,760
Everybody, listen to me.

205
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,690
Fight desperately with you! Bandits!

206
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,690
Everybody.

207
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,600
Do I look like a bandit

208
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,990
who kills people?

209
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,850
I’m also on my way

210
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,470
to visit my grandson.

211
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,830
Buy some good clothes for this boy

212
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,220
and bury him.

213
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,960
You mistake us as bandits.

214
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,680
I think the real murderers

215
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,680
must be dressed up like us.

216
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,110
However,

217
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,590
your village is only one day’s walk
away from Jingzhou.

218
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,480
Huo’s Manor is nearby.

219
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:02,240
How do they allow martial artists

220
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,030
to rob people?

221
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,080
Since Old Master Huo was sick,

222
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,690
we’ve never seen anyone
from Huo’s Manor.

223
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,540
What martial artists?

224
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,540
They’re bandits!

225
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,340
Head!

226
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,230
Bandits. Real bandits.

227
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,220
They’ve come!

228
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,480
Right at the village entrance!

229
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,030
Sheng.

230
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,390
Go protect the villagers.

231
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,620
The rest of you,

232
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,870
go figure out

233
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,530
how many bandits there are.

234
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,050
-Aye.
-Aye.

235
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:27,600
Fei.

236
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,340
Go with me to see their chief.

237
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:31,610
Okay.

238
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,290
But...

239
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,590
If you fight them,

240
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,590
you’ll bring death

241
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,470
to the whole village.

242
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:40,870
I see.

243
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,550
Everybody, hide yourselves.

244
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,780
Put away your blades.

245
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,700
Hurry. Hurry.

246
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,270
You two, go check it.

247
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,100
Hurry. Get in, everybody.

248
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,130
At last,

249
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,130
he is getting mature.

250
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,320
When we see the bandits,

251
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,320
show them this hairpin.

252
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,700
This is the logo of your sect.

253
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:08,920
You’re going to tell them

254
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,720
who you are?

255
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,920
I suspect they’re related
to Huo’s Manor.

256
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,640
If they manage

257
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,920
to recognize us,

258
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,820
they won’t hurt us without restraint.

259
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,890
By then,

260
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,970
we’ll go to Huo’s Manor
and check what happened.

261
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,920
Come on.

262
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,220
Here comes a beautiful girl.

263
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,210
What?

264
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,290
You know...

265
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,030
You know martial arts?

266
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,940
Sir.

267
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,510
I’m going back to my hometown

268
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,910
with my young girl.

269
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,280
We’re not from a rich family.

270
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,880
How about this?

271
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,190
I have a gold hairpin.

272
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,890
Take it

273
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,610
as a little tip.

274
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,120
I beg you, sir.

275
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,540
Please let us go.

276
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,970
Girl, go.

277
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,510
Give it to them.

278
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,980
Madam, it’s considerate of you!

279
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,230
Why don’t you

280
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,630
give us

281
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,080
your carriage, too?

282
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,130
I’ve been travelling all the way,

283
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,390
to see my grandson.

284
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,880
The carriage...

285
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,280
Fine.

286
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,570
I’ll walk back, then.

287
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:44,940
Fei.

288
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,710
Go.

289
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,790
Go get the carriage.

290
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:49,920
Go.

291
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,460
Don’t force yourself.

292
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,520
Madam.

293
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,750
Why don’t you give us

294
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,300
this beautiful girl, too?

295
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,570
In a couple of days,

296
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,610
we’ll drive a carriage

297
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,220
and get you back home proudly.

298
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,060
What do you think?

299
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,830
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

300
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:05,980
Girl.

301
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,710
I always tell you

302
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,250
to be calm and reasonable

303
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,510
when travelling around.

304
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,340
And you should obey others’ rules.

305
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,740
But if you meet

306
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,880
-such unreasonable guys...
-Cut the crap!

307
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,480
Fight them!

308
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,980
They’re the first victims

309
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,780
that you killed

310
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,260
with the Snow-breaking Blade.

311
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,600
You haven’t used it for a long time.

312
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,640
They kind of

313
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,430
deserve it.

314
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,170
Xiaoxiang Arrow hasn’t been used

315
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,860
for twenty years.

316
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,240
Today,

317
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,990
it tastes blood again.

318
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,170
Ms. Wang.

319
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,290
Sheng.

320
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,100
Hong Yun.

321
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:01,600
Here.

322
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,070
Take your men to check

323
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,090
if there’re bandits escaping.

324
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:05,960
Aye.

325
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,080
Come with me.

326
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,350
Such bad bandits

327
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,110
deserve to be killed!

328
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,410
Sheng.

329
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,700
Roll up their trousers

330
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,300
and check their legs.

331
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,760
Ms. Wang.

332
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,640
They all wear protective gear.

333
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,710
Seems like they fight with legs.

334
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,550
Across the world,

335
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,140
only people from Huo’s Manor
fight with legs.

336
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,250
Why have they

337
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,660
become bandits?

338
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,370
Ms. Wang.

339
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,610
We’re supposed to pass Huo’s Manor.

340
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:01,780
Shall we

341
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,220
tell Old Master Huo about it

342
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,970
so that he’ll restrain his disciples?

343
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:05,650
No.

344
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,880
We’ll go to Huarong instead.

345
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,130
Why?

346
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,320
Sheng.

347
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,480
You’re one of the best disciples

348
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,360
among your generation
in the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

349
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,870
Think about it.

350
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,950
Do you think

351
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,080
Mr. Li won’t restrain you?

352
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,340
No way.

353
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,340
You mean

354
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,570
Old Master Huo knows about it?

355
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,590
Maybe...

356
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,810
-he connived with them...?
-Don’t imagine things.

357
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,220
We come to Jingzhou,

358
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,180
trying to ask Huo’s Manor
to help us look for Chenfei.

359
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,760
But seems like

360
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,810
they’re also in trouble.

361
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,650
Besides,

362
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,320
Chenfei is travelling around,

363
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,200
with General Wu’s families.

364
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,020
Even if they keep a low profile,

365
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,550
there’ll be news.

366
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:52,590
In this way,

367
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,360
secret services in Huarong
will find out them.

368
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,250
What about the villagers here?

369
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,170
If these bandits are really

370
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,120
from Huo’s Manor,

371
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,120
I’m afraid they can’t stay here.

372
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,780
Everybody,

373
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,360
you’d better go to your families
for shelter.

374
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,840
Who can we go to?

375
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,840
It’s the same wherever we live.

376
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,420
Who cares about us?

377
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,130
Yeah. Who cares?

378
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,340
Go to the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

379
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,290
and my mother will take care of you.

380
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,220
Zhou Fei!

381
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,310
Shut up.

382
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,480
But I’m right.

383
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,480
Within our territory,

384
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,780
my mother will take care of them.

385
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,780
Sheng.

386
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,840
Bandits are rampant.

387
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,100
But within the territory

388
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,450
of the Fortress of the Forty-Eight,

389
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:44,040
people still enjoy a good life.

390
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,830
Everybody,

391
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,140
if you want to go there,

392
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,770
take it

393
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:57,100
as the travelling expense.

394
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,790
When you get there,

395
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,790
show them this token

396
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,340
and tell them

397
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,780
I asked you to go.

398
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,370
You’ll be taken care of.

399
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,280
-Thank you, Madam.
-Thank you.

400
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,690
Thank you, Madam. Thank you.

401
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:13,370
Go. Go.

402
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,220
Ms. Wang.

403
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,480
Fei.

404
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,920
You did it right today.

405
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,660
We can use our weapons to kill people,

406
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,490
but also to save people.

407
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,120
You used your Snow-breaking Blade
to save people.

408
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,350
You were right.

409
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,580
Ms. Wang.

410
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,010
Such bandits showed up suddenly.

411
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,470
I wonder if Chenfei and his men

412
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,580
are in danger.

413
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,300
I want to go and check it

414
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,350
so that we’ll get prepared.

415
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,720
Don’t be anxious.

416
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,970
It’s dangerous for you to go alone.

417
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,570
Let’s discuss it tomorrow.

418
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,380
After I left home,

419
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,450
I somehow felt lonely.

420
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,240
When I was home,

421
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,100
I could be nervous

422
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,340
even when my mother stopped me
for a talk.

423
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,090
Since my father left,

424
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,640
I’ve been expecting

425
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,140
to look for him down the mountain.

426
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,070
It’s been only a few days

427
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,190
since we came down,

428
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,910
I’m already missing my mother.

429
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,330
Li Sheng!

430
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,960
Where are you going?

431
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,080
Hyah!

432
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,100
Hyah!

433
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,490
Ms. Wang.

434
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,310
Wait for my good news.

435
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,720
Hyah!

436
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,930
Zhou Fei, when I do something great,

437
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,930
I’ll impress you!

438
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,580
Madam Li.

439
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,140
Why are you making things worse?

440
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:23,960
Ms. Wang.

441
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,240
We still haven’t found them.

442
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,690
Ms. Wang.

443
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,790
We haven’t found Li Sheng or Zhou Fei.

444
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,820
But there’s no trace of fighting around.

445
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,400
I guess they have left on their own.

446
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,190
We haven’t found Chenfei yet.

447
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,020
But they two are missing, too.

448
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:41,780
I shouldn’t have taken them out!

449
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,850
It’s their first time to come out.

450
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,770
They haven’t seen
anything like that before.

451
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,690
I’m afraid they’ve gone to Huo’s Manor

452
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,640
to stand out for justice.

453
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,540
I don’t think so.

454
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,130
Sheng is quick-witted.

455
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,580
Fei is calm.

456
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,940
I don’t think

457
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,870
they would be so reckless.

458
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:10,780
Uh...

459
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,470
Why is here such a good horse?

460
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,740
Could it be a horse from those guys

461
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,520
who were caught?

462
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:23,420
How lucky I am!

463
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,090
Our horse?

464
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,610
Hey, I’m back!

465
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,380
And a good horse.

466
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,230
Looks good.

467
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,360
How did you get it?

468
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:08,820
Yeah.

469
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,900
Well done, guys.

470
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,530
Keep guarding the prison.
I’m getting in.

471
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,890
What is this place?

472
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,890
Why are there so many guards?

473
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,800
I should get myself in.

474
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,820
I can’t hesitate.

475
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,220
Who? After her!

476
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:37,570
That way! After her!

477
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:54,120
Did you see her clearly?

478
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,390
Looks like a young girl.

479
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,650
Go figure out who she is.

480
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,230
Get her to me,
no matter what it takes!

481
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:13,690
Get up for the meal!

482
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,810
Don’t you know

483
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,720
our Old Master Li is a sworn brother

484
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,990
with your Old Master Huo?

485
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,630
How dare you treat us like this!

486
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,630
Let us out! Let us out!

487
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,390
Shut up!

488
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:30,710
Stop yelling!

489
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,720
Let us out!

490
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,500
Let us out!

491
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,420
Somebody! Let us out! Open the door!

492
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,190
Why are you locking us up? Let us out!

493
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,920
Somebody! Let us out!

494
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,690
Shut up!

495
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,920
Let us out! Let us out!

496
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:52,150
Stop yelling!
You can’t run away by yelling.

497
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,180
If you keep yelling,

498
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,030
I’ll lash you!

499
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,050
I really didn’t expect this.

500
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,910
Huo’s Manor used

501
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,910
to be a decent sect.

502
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:07,910
But it turns out

503
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,610
to be so shameless!

504
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,430
Sister.

505
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,750
Didn’t Dad say

506
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,260
all martial artists

507
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:19,570
are loyal heroes?

508
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,010
Whenever I’m clever,

509
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,130
I’ll suffer

510
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,690
soon after that.

511
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,830
What wrong

512
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,950
have I done?

513
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,470
I’m so lucky today.

514
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,950
Something good will certainly happen.

515
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:09,880
Beautiful girl.

516
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,220
Hello.

517
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,360
Who are you?

518
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,840
Are you locked up?

519
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,730
I am.

520
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,730
In this place,

521
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,220
many guys are locked up.

522
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,460
Didn’t you see them when you came in?

523
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,220
Along the mountain walls

524
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,470
are separate cells.

525
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,470
Different heroes yell with curses

526
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,330
every day.

527
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,460
Sounds interesting.

528
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,770
What a pity!

529
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:47,790
I come too late.

530
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,890
I don’t even have a decent cell.

531
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,940
It is a quiet corner.

532
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,030
But I can hardly join them in yelling.

533
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,080
What about you?

534
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,790
How did you come in?

535
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,700
I came because the damn mountain

536
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,620
was hollow.

537
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,030
I fell in.

538
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,990
You’re not staying in a cell?

539
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,700
Who is the owner of this place?

540
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,570
Why did he catch you?

541
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,180
Look up.

542
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,080
Some light trickles in on your left.

543
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,610
Move over there, okay?

544
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,030
Finally, there comes a beautiful girl.

545
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,430
Let me enjoy your beautiful face.

546
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,160
Why does he sound

547
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,160
so familiar?

548
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,710
Do you have any food?

549
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,540
I take it with me to feed dogs.

550
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,980
Is this

551
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,970
for dogs?

552
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:48,980
He’s really that dog.

553
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,970
You are...

554
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,460
Xie Meimei?

555
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,490
Weed Spirit?

556
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,630
I shouldn’t have saved you.

557
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,750
Xie Meimei.

558
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,850
I was just joking.

559
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,600
Call me Xie Yun.

560
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,910
Why are you here?

561
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,970
We come down the mountains for business.

562
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,910
But I think my cousin has been caught.

563
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,300
Why are you and your cousin

564
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,890
always in trouble

565
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,190
whenever I meet you?

566
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,920
Because Li Sheng always

567
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,060
asks for trouble.

568
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,060
It doesn’t matter.

569
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,520
There’s food and drink.

570
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,060
I don’t think

571
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:05,820
your cousin is in danger now.

572
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,710
Time for meal!

573
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:15,360
Time for dinner.

574
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,430
Hurry. Hurry!

575
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:25,730
It’s yours.

576
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:27,780
Here.

577
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:40,940
Hurry!

578
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,250
Pancakes again?

579
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,930
Did you see a female burglar
running past?

580
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,630
It’s such a dark dungeon.

581
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,470
I can see no one,

582
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,790
but a female ghost.

583
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:00,950
You’re right.

584
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,400
Eat it quickly.

585
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,370
It’s okay.

586
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,760
The guard brought me food.

587
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:22,620
I think they’re still looking for you.

588
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,100
Oh,

589
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,100
are you hungry?

590
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,020
Not really.

591
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,140
If you’re not hungry,

592
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,120
I’ll have it first.

593
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,300
If you’re hungry,

594
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,710
I’ll cover it when eating.

595
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,810
Don’t bother.

596
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:41,530
Enjoy yourself.

597
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,290
I’d better cover it.

598
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,220
Where there’s a chance,

599
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,950
I’ll invite you
to the best restaurant in Jiankang.

600
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,300
Among all the great restaurants,

601
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,140
half are in Jiankang.

602
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:09,970
Girl.

603
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:12,050
When they stop looking for you,

604
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,200
I’ll show you a way out.

605
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,370
Leave quickly.

606
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,920
Let’s meet if it’s fated.

607
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,240
Remember.

608
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,460
I owe you a meal.

609
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,100
I can’t treat you

610
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:25,010
with this one.

611
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,370
There’s something

612
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:27,680
in this meal.

613
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,930
What?

614
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,370
You...

615
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,250
You’re not leaving?

616
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,400
I can’t leave.

617
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:37,280
Weakness powder.

618
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:38,290
Have you heard of it?

619
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:40,950
I don’t think so.

620
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,920
It’s something dirty

621
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,150
evil sects usually use.

622
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,470
It’s a kind of sleeping drug.

623
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,310
When you have some,

624
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,490
you’ll be too weak to get up for days.

625
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,640
You cannot

626
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,820
use your martial arts, either.

627
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,630
Then why did you still eat it?

628
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,030
Because I’m not a camel

629
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,230
or tortoise.

630
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,370
When I eat some,
I’ll be too weak to get up.

631
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,330
But if I don’t eat any,

632
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:07,440
I won’t get up ever again.

633
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:18,060
We met by chance.

634
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,340
But every time we meet, we’re in danger.

635
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,340
We’re kind of sworn friends
for life or death.

636
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:23,880
How about this?

637
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,360
Call me Brother.

638
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:27,210
What do you think?

639
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,320
I’ve been kind for not killing you.

640
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,780
How dare you try
to get in good with me!

641
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,190
Well, what a pity!

642
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,010
If you kill me,

643
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,540
no one can tell you

644
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,280
what great things your father has done.

645
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,460
What do you think?

646
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:48,460
Would you like to listen?

647
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,810
You mean

648
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,420
you have news about my father?

649
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,380
Six months ago,

650
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,770
your father came out

651
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,360
and took over Anping Army.

652
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:00,320
He made a peaceful land

653
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,960
for homeless people.

654
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,760
Wherever his army went,

655
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,990
people enjoyed a good life.

656
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,390
Where is my father now?

657
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,860
I don’t know.

658
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,150
There’s no fixed marching route.

659
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,260
I thought I could see my father

660
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,620
when I came out.

661
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:31,960
Go away!

662
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,320
I always have compassion for girls.

663
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:49,990
Unexpectedly,

664
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,990
I still hurt you.

665
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,110
Girl.

666
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,880
If you’re angry,

667
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:57,980
chop me to vent your anger,

668
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,190
okay?

669
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,710
I used

670
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,010
to be sad.

671
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,910
I thought my father wouldn’t have left

672
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,060
if you hadn’t gone to my home.

673
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,560
But when I’m here

674
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,530
and see what happens,

675
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,890
I’m no longer that angry.

676
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,360
I’m relieved, then.

677
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,130
I won’t fear that you beat me

678
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,460
when I see you again.

679
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:36,230
A weak and honest scholar like me

680
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,620
will not be strong enough

681
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:40,350
if you bully me.

682
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,270
Even if I want to vent on you,

683
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:45,480
I should at least get out of this place.

684
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,180
Tell me.

685
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,970
What happened here?

686
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,720
Do you know Huo’s Manor?

687
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:31,950
This year, Old Master Huo
had his seventieth birthday,

688
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,560
and invited his families and friends.

689
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:35,070
Don’t be wordy.

690
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:35,900
Just get to the point.

691
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,400
Anyway,

692
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,890
when he sends the invitation,

693
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,890
people would come to congratulate him.

694
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,700
But I don’t think

695
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,500
they dare to send it
to Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

696
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,080
If Ms. Li really came,

697
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,360
they could hardly wind this matter up.

698
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:51,200
Why?

699
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,950
Because of Huo Liantao.

700
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,090
He is Junior Master Huo,

701
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,400
the younger brother of Old Master Huo.

702
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:00,510
In the name of his brother’s birthday,

703
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:01,640
he forced all guests

704
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,550
to join his sect

705
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:03,720
and treat him as the leader.

706
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,230
He planned to found

707
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:08,570
the second Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

708
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,840
If he wanted that,

709
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,240
didn’t Old Master Huo restrain him?

710
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,080
Old Master Huo is now mentally disabled.

711
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,310
I hear he was so sick

712
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:23,090
that he barely knew anybody.

713
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,930
He didn’t even remember who he was.

714
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,670
Did Huo Liantao make decision for him?

715
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:30,770
He caught people like you

716
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:32,080
who didn’t support him?

717
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:36,040
No wonder

718
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,310
I saw people with Huo’s Manor

719
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:40,570
plunder everywhere,

720
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:41,980
disguised as bandits.

721
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,580
They even robbed horses.

722
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,860
They’re from a famous sect.

723
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,650
Why did they do such a shameless thing?

724
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:50,260
You’re wrong.

725
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,260
Since Huo Liantao wants to be a leader,

726
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:53,920
he won’t disgrace himself.

727
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,190
He walked out those guests

728
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,260
who went to the birthday party.

729
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,200
But soon,

730
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:01,090
he asked his disgraceful friends

731
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:02,110
to catch them

732
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,260
and lock them up in this dungeon.

733
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,030
Isn’t he deceiving himself?

734
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,110
So,

735
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:08,790
that’s how you were caught?

736
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,130
No.

737
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:11,310
I was lucky.

738
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:12,840
I didn’t go to the birthday party.

739
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,230
But sadly,

740
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:17,230
I met guys from Huo’s Manor

741
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,450
with your people.

742
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:20,890
Who do you mean?

743
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,350
The man who used martial arts
from Xiaoxiang Sect

744
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,680
when your father tried to catch me.

745
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,680
Chenfei?

746
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,080
How did you meet him?

747
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,120
I was on my way for business

748
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:38,550
when I met them.

749
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,860
Later, we were all caught

750
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:42,920
and locked up in this place.

751
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:47,550
So,

752
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,820
you brought Chenfei and the Wu family

753
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,410
to this place?

754
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,090
You really are Lord Gantang’s daughter.

755
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:55,100
It’s smart of you.

756
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,610
You’re smart.

757
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:59,480
You’re so smart

758
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,920
that you brought Chenfei
to this dangerous place.

759
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,730
And you get yourself stuck in here, too.

760
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,260
You’ll even sprout with some water.

761
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:08,370
It’s not my fault.

762
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,450
Everyone knows people in Huo’s Manor

763
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:11,830
are close to your sect.

764
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:13,210
Besides,

765
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:14,890
your senior brothers are very vigilant

766
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:16,890
against me.

767
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:21,950
I’m going to save them.

768
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:22,950
Wait.

769
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,350
So many martial artists are locked here.

770
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,300
How can you save them?
