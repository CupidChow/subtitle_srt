00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,000
He’s going to kill Yin Pei?

172
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,510
The martial world is now disunited.

173
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,880
Your cousin has the potential
to be the Head of All Sects.

174
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,880
He has the potential to dream about it.

175
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,080
He has poor martial arts

176
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,270
and he wants to kill Yin Pei?

177
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,680
Isn’t he risking his neck?

178
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,080
All right.

179
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,390
Let’s go help him.

180
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,440
Is this the way to Liu’s Manor?

181
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,240
It is, Miss Zhou.

182
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,640
Except Jiankang,

183
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,880
where else do you want to go?

184
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,730
The Xiang River.

185
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,710
It’s not far away from my home.

186
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,810
You stayed there?

187
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,950
I stayed on Penglai Island
for the longest time.

188
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,350
I stayed in Jiangling for a while.

189
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,780
I just went to the Xiang River
for a few times.

190
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,080
Why do you want to go there?

191
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,260
When my father suppressed the rebellion,

192
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,680
he was drowned in the Xiang River.

193
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,990
At that time,

194
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,420
I was only one year old.

195
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,910
Then my dynasty was gone.

196
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,500
I became a prince in exile.

197
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,250
Whenever I was in confusion
or in danger,

198
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,890
I went to find an answer
by the Xiang River.

199
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,620
I didn’t remember my father.

200
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,770
But later, I got to know

201
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,680
my father told his subordinate

202
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,020
that he would die in the Xiang River

203
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,400
before he went out to the battle.

204
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,930
He even told about his own funeral.

205
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,600
Sounds like

206
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,070
he didn’t care about his death.

207
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,330
Now think about it.

208
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,950
Back then, he might be

209
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,950
under the same situation

210
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,240
as mine.

211
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,470
You don’t need to be depressed.

212
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,200
You’re different from your father.

213
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,710
To be bestowed with big responsibility,
you must be crucified

214
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,680
with ordeal and tribulation
to break your will.

215
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,170
Everything will be fine.

216
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,030
You’ve read a lot of books lately.

217
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,640
What’s wrong with you?

218
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,390
You poked me so hard.

219
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,640
I...

220
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,910
I was tricking you.

221
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,200
Who do you want?

222
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,120
You must be Lord Liu.

223
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,830
I’m Wu Chuchu
with the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

224
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,030
Please leave.

225
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,510
Come some other day.

226
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,880
Today is my mother’s birthday.

227
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,080
I have guests.

228
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,760
You’d better leave

229
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,200
and come some other day.

230
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,330
Lord Liu.

231
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,760
Chuchu?

232
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,350
Sheng.

233
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,100
What brings you here?

234
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,060
(Forever Longevity)

235
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,510
It’s about time.

236
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,830
Today is

237
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,710
my mother’s birthday party!

238
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,390
As the saying goes,

239
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,440
when someone is 73 or 84 years old,

240
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,350
even if the King of Hell
doesn’t want him,

241
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,710
he will die.

242
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,000
Who are you cursing?

243
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,030
Who are you cursing?

244
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,950
Mother, don’t be angry.

245
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,510
I haven’t finished yet.

246
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,710
Sit back. Sit down.

247
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,200
But I...

248
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,760
I don’t believe that.

249
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,640
So,

250
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,510
I invite you here

251
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,480
to have fun.

252
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,590
In the name of the birthday party,

253
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,200
Lord Liu invited martial artists

254
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,830
to kill Iron-masked Demons.

255
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:57,470
We will get over

256
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,710
all difficulties!

257
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,640
Bravo!

258
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,590
Enjoy yourselves, everybody.

259
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,950
Bravo! Bravo!

260
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,910
Come on.

261
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,760
Cheers. Cheers.

262
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,680
Let’s wait and see.

263
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,000
So much fun!

264
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,950
Go on.

265
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,800
Are you Qinghui, the Immortal?

266
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,950
What?

267
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,470
You haven’t got it ready yet?

268
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,240
I’m sorry.

269
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,270
Today is my mother’s birthday.

270
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,240
So many friends have come.

271
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,470
Could you give me one more day?

272
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,390
I’ll give you what you want tomorrow.

273
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,090
Well, I’m just in time.

274
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,030
I’d like to enjoy the party, too.

275
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,880
Sure. Sure.

276
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,470
What’s this?

277
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,510
It’s an antique.

278
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,240
It’s said to be kept
in the Dragon King’s mouth.

279
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,150
Put in the mouth,
it can resolve all toxins.

280
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,120
It’s really an extraordinary thing.

281
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,880
My father once had one.

282
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,680
But it was lost
after my family declined.

283
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,680
What a coincidence!

284
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,640
Why don’t you open it
and let me have a look?

285
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,150
What? I can’t see it?

286
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,710
You can. You can.

287
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,150
Come on. Bring it up

288
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,800
and show it to him.

289
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,710
Aye. Hurry.

290
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,440
Come on.

291
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,910
Come on.

292
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:01,880
Everyone, let’s kill him!

293
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,710
It’s so easy

294
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,870
to catch him?

295
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,990
He doesn’t look strong enough

296
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,440
to have destroyed
the Four-guardian Mountain.

297
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,080
What has gone wrong?

298
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,990
You’re right.

299
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,440
Intruder!

300
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,910
I’ll make you pay with your life!

301
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,320
Why are there another seven?

302
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,480
He’s shorter than Yin Pei. It’s not him.

303
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,480
Judged from the figure,

304
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,800
none of them can be Yin Pei.

305
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,080
Leave if you don’t want to die!

306
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,680
If you stay, you’ll be dead meat!

307
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,780
I didn’t expect to see another seven.

308
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,910
It’s so stubborn of you.

309
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,360
Don’t blame us for being cruel!

310
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,200
We die a right death for justice!

311
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,200
Come on!

312
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,630
Mr. Yang, I’ll find the real one.

313
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,110
Stall for as much time as you can.

314
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,230
Okay.

315
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:29,110
They’re fighting
when hurting themselves.

316
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,360
They must have taken Phoenix Pills.

317
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,630
Looks like

318
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,230
they fight
with the formation of Qi School.

319
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,750
No way. If we continue this way,

320
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,150
we’ll have losses

321
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,270
before we find Yin Pei out.

322
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,840
I must find a place

323
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,230
and break their formation

324
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,870
with the same Eight-trigram principle

325
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,440
so that we can defeat them one by one.

326
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,910
Chuchu, hide yourself.

327
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,600
Don’t come out.

328
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,910
Qinghui.

329
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,110
Why do you not show us your face?

330
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,800
What a coward you are!

331
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,620
(Lasting Prosperity)

332
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,500
(Lofty Virtues)

333
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,560
Qian, three Yang. Kun, six Yin.

334
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,940
(Lasting Prosperity Lofty Virtues)

335
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,840
Dui, three Yin on the top.
Xun, three Yin on the bottom.

336
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,200
There are eight Qinghui.

337
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,600
Madam Nichang.

338
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,510
It’s time to strike!

339
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,870
Miss Zhou, how will the whistle

340
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,840
help with the fight?

341
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,390
It’s the secret signal

342
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,870
Li Sheng and I used when we were little.

343
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:15,960
It’s been years since we last used it.

344
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,630
I wonder if he can hear me.

345
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,870
Qinghui.

346
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,630
My cousin and you are old acquaintances!

347
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,870
If you don’t come out,

348
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,560
she’ll find you personally!

349
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,720
Wait here for me.

350
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,870
Run if anything happens.

351
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,560
Damn it!

352
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,320
Could you stop being a busybody?

353
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,630
Yin Pei?

354
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,440
You’re making trouble again.

355
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,750
I’ll kill these evil men

356
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,360
to avenge my family!

357
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,270
Mr. Zou.

358
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,390
I know you can’t hold back your anger

359
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,200
with Iron-masked Demons.

360
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,030
But they are already captives.

361
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,360
If we kill them as we wish,

362
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,150
we’ll be as cruel as them.

363
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,630
Mr. Li, thanks to you.

364
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,960
You’ve been stronger?

365
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,960
You nearly wound me.

366
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,560
Sheng, let me have a look.

367
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,200
Are you hurt?

368
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,600
I’m fine.

369
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,720
I saw Yin Pei run away.

370
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,320
Yin Pei!

371
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,230
Are you going
to let everyone know

372
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,510
you’re Yin Wenlan’s son?

373
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,510
Shut up!

374
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,720
In the past,

375
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,990
you were not free

376
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,990
and you were threatened
by Zheng Luosheng.

377
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,990
Now you’re free

378
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,720
and no longer take orders from anyone,

379
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,150
yet you become Zheng Luosheng!

380
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,910
You really surprise me!

381
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,680
I killed Ding Kui

382
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,840
for those cowards
who only dare to complain.

383
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,030
I wiped out the Four-guardian Mountain

384
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,080
which always scared them.

385
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,390
I ridded them of their big concern.

386
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,560
Now, I’m the next big concern.

387
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,870
Tell me, is this reasonable?

388
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,360
But later you hired lackeys
and bullied people.

389
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,150
You think you’re doing right things?

390
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,150
I don’t want to argue with you

391
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,030
about reasons or kindnesses.

392
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,480
As long as you correct yourself

393
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,110
and no longer hurt the martial artists
and common people,

394
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,600
I’ll let you go.

395
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:05,390
Great! How impressive!

396
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:06,840
I’ll see

397
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,030
how long you can last.

398
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,510
Yin Pei.

399
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,870
You really bring shame
on your ancestors!

400
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,150
What benefits can you get
from harming people and yourself?

401
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,110
What a psychopath you are!

402
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,110
You took me as an outcast first!

403
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,680
Fine.

404
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,440
I will be a mad man.

405
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,840
I’ll make everyone scared of me.

406
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,660
I’ll make them run away
whenever they see me!

407
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,750
My father is dead.

408
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,930
You regard him as a saint.

409
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,990
If he were still alive,

410
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,840
I don’t think you would do that.

411
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,960
This is how you think of your father?

412
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,510
I had thought

413
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:53,510
Zheng Luosheng killed my father.

414
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,630
Later I thought

415
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,480
Ji Yunchen was the real culprit.

416
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,390
But now,

417
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,720
they’ve both been dead.

418
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,600
I still feel the same pain.

419
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,510
It wasn’t until today did I realize

420
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,360
how funny I was!

421
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:16,390
You distort facts and talk nonsense!

422
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,750
I think, you didn’t only go wrong
when practicing martial arts.

423
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,600
Your brain has also gone wrong!

424
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,390
Zhou Fei.

425
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:25,800
I owe you
for what happened on Mount Heng.

426
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,600
I’ll let you go today. Leave right away.

427
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,680
We’re even.

428
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,480
Go!

429
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,350
Yin Pei.

430
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,620
Your hands are shivering.

431
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,990
How dare you say you’ll let me go?

432
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,720
I’m saying it one last time.

433
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,200
Restrain your men!

434
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,080
Otherwise,

435
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,150
I will kill you,

436
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,450
even with my last breath!

437
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,230
Let’s see

438
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,270
if you can.

439
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,290
Zhu Chen?

440
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,440
Miss Zhou.

441
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,110
If I had the afterlife,

442
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:44,140
I would want to meet you again.

443
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:48,960
Outside Lingling Town,

444
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,680
-Fei.
-I would invite you to my home.

445
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,440
Many fragrans are grown in my home.

446
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,510
If we go now,

447
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,100
we can see the flowers blossoming

448
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,480
if we travel fast enough.

449
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,150
The second son of Fist Gang?

450
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,070
Fist Gang was famous
in the martial world.

451
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,320
Later, it declined

452
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,990
and then disappeared.

453
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,510
Since you’re all heirs of decent sects,

454
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,840
why do you wear the iron mask?

455
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:49,270
People choose to be kind or evil.

456
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,680
When you have great martial arts

457
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,910
without a kind heart,

458
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,960
what’s the point
even if you’re invincible?

459
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,560
You’re blindfolded

460
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,630
by the effect of Phoenix Pill

461
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,230
and deceived by what Yin Pei said.

462
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,100
You think you can solve everything
with martial arts?

463
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,990
Hope you’ll wake up in time

464
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,680
and no longer hide behind the mask.

465
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,500
Do some decent things.

466
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,720
Mr. Li, how should we deal with them?

467
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,270
They were deceived by Yin Pei.

468
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,700
Since they took Phoenix Pills,
they would die soon.

469
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,570
Lock them up

470
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,520
and let them reflect on their fault.

471
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,200
Okay.

472
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,840
Take them away.

473
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,110
-Aye!
-Aye!

474
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,800
-Go.
-Go.

475
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,270
Get up.

476
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:45,460
(Xingnan Sect)

477
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,320
(Grave of Zhu Chen with Xingnan Sect)

478
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,080
We met so many things
during the trip to Lingling.

479
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,840
Each can be a long story,

480
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,200
except Xingnan Sect

481
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,790
I helped on my way.

482
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,100
We met only a few times.

483
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,580
I didn’t expect him

484
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,130
to save me with his own life.

485
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,180
Do you know

486
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,960
why he did that?

487
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,890
If I just left
the Fortress of the Forty-Eight,

488
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,410
I would feel confused

489
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,080
and I wouldn’t feel grateful.

490
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,830
But now...

491
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,220
I...

492
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,850
I understand.

493
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,680
If there were a second chance,

494
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,440
I’m afraid he would save you, too.

495
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,540
(Grave of Zhu Chen with Xingnan Sect)

496
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,760
I didn’t have a chance
to say thanks to him.

497
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,150
I remember the Departure Sorrow Pavilion
you once told me.

498
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,320
It was famous throughout the world.

499
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,150
Now, even the poorest actresses

500
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,800
don’t want to sing it.

501
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,120
Yeah.

502
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,560
The world is in the chaos of war.

503
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,510
Everyone struggles to survive.

504
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:19,750
Operas are performed
about family feud and national hatred.

505
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,560
Romance is too far away.

506
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,190
Let’s go.

507
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,510
At least,

508
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:49,840
we can help small sects
like Xingnan Sect

509
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,360
to stop being bullied.

510
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,880
Okay.

511
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,400
But...

512
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,270
I still want

513
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,600
more decent martial artists

514
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,920
to protect the people

515
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,320
so that they can enjoy a happy life.

516
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:12,420
(Grave of Zhu Chen with Xingnan Sect)

517
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,430
(Longevity)
Please help me with it.

518
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,950
Mr. Li, look.

519
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,710
Uh...

520
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,030
Mr. Zou and all of you.

521
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:28,710
What...?

522
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,030
What are you doing?

523
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,600
Mr. Li, we come to say thank you.

524
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,950
If you hadn’t gathered us

525
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,880
to fight Iron-masked Demons together,

526
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,840
I’m afraid I wouldn’t have taken revenge

527
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,920
for my family.

528
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,840
Mr. Li, please accept our respects!

529
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:46,920
You’re welcome.

530
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,120
Everybody,

531
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,400
please get up.

532
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,190
Uh...

533
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:55,400
I was just an initiator,

534
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,710
following the will of everyone.

535
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,950
(Longevity)
We succeeded

536
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:01,880
(Longevity)
because we worked and untied as one.

537
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,190
Thank you, everyone.

538
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:08,920
Are wounded men alright?

539
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,190
They’ve been taken care of.

540
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,120
Among Iron-masked Demons,

541
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,120
Yin Pei escaped alone.

542
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,400
Some unconvinced ones committed suicide.

543
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,990
Some others realized their mistakes,

544
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,640
saying they would correct their errors

545
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,230
and no longer hurt people.

546
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,800
They’re just frustrated men

547
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,230
who were instigated by Yin Pei.

548
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,840
They tried to satisfy their own desire

549
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,580
in extreme ways.

550
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,800
But Yin Pei is still on the run.

551
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,840
So, everyone,

552
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,190
please pay attention to Yin Pei

553
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:40,990
where you travel around

554
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,320
so that we can kill him
as soon as possible.

555
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,840
Sure.

556
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,190
We will still try to find Yin Pei.

557
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,470
But...

558
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,510
I think

559
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,800
we need a leader like Mr. Li

560
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,030
for the martial world.

561
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,190
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah.

562
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,510
I just came out
from the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

563
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,920
I don’t have enough experience.

564
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,600
I have poor martial arts, too.

565
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,880
I believe you’ll find a real master

566
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,710
who has better martial arts
and more experience

567
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,160
to be the leader.

568
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,840
Don’t be modest, Mr. Li.

569
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,920
What happened this time

570
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,080
has proved your ability to be a leader!

571
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,160
Yeah.

572
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,600
I...

573
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,030
I don’t mean to be modest.

574
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,750
I have the same thought as yours.

575
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,360
I just don’t want
to see more men like Yin Pei

576
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,360
or more evil things like this.

577
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,750
I know what I can do.

578
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,750
I think we should pick

579
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,080
a more suitable man

580
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,800
to be the leader.

581
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,600
But...

582
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,030
Fei, what’s on your mind?

583
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,190
It’s broken again.

584
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:04,640
My father gave this blade to me.

585
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,000
Do you think

586
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,680
it can be repaired?

587
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,260
It’s not hard

588
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,400
to repair it.

589
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,840
Even I can do it.

590
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,950
But this was forged

591
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,430
with some special material.

592
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,510
I’m afraid I can’t find proper material.

593
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,600
Besides,

594
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,270
even if it is repaired,

595
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,880
it won’t be as sharp as before.

596
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,400
If you keep using it that way,

597
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,160
you’ll break it again soon.

598
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,470
You don’t feel sorry for yourself,
but for the blade.

599
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:43,080
You’re really unique.

600
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:45,560
Don’t worry.

601
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,270
I owe you a blade.

602
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,840
I’ll give you

603
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,670
a cart of blades wrapped in red silk

604
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:53,080
and send them to your home

605
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,730
in a big way.

606
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:58,600
Who wants so many blades?

607
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,510
If they look good,

608
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,600
but turn out to be useless like you,

609
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,800
what do I do?

610
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,030
Anyway, don’t worry.

611
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:10,640
I’ll make the best blade for you.

612
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,990
Where’s Li Sheng?

613
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,160
Why didn’t I see him?

614
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,190
Yin Pei was defeated.

615
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,800
It was a great satisfaction.

616
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:21,510
Martial artists like your cousin.

617
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,160
He’s busy associating with them.

618
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,750
Madam Nichang, thank you for helping us

619
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,400
defeat Iron-masked Demons.

620
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,360
Without your help,

621
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,120
we wouldn’t have succeeded so smoothly.

622
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,720
Thanks to your plan, too.

623
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,560
I just used my brain

624
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,920
and thought of a plan.

625
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:46,750
These martial artists are nice to you,

626
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:49,800
not only for the sake of your aunt.

627
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:52,560
You led everyone else…

628
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,560
to defeat Iron-masked Demons.

629
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,190
I guess they have seen a little hope.

630
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:08,840
Everyone feels insecure
in such a dangerous world.

631
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,750
When everyone can

632
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,990
hardly breathe,

633
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,990
they all want

634
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,600
to see someone

635
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,190
like Li Zheng or Yin Wenlan.

636
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,450
You’re Li Zheng’s grandson.

637
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,950
Do you understand me?

638
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:30,100
I’m far weaker than my grandfather.

639
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,710
Don’t think lightly of yourself.

640
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,080
The man who can unite everyone

641
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,800
may not necessarily
have the best martial arts.

642
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,990
Don’t disappoint their trust

643
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:46,190
on you.

644
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:12,290
If I hadn’t come to help you
after receiving your letter,

645
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,640
would you have died?

646
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:20,670
So many martial artists were here.

647
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,710
Why would I

648
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,950
depend on you only?

649
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,950
But we underestimated Yin Pei.

650
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,320
If we recognized him earlier...

651
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,750
Miss Zhou, thank you for saving me.

652
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,920
All right?

653
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:51,990
All right. All right.

654
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,190
These martial artists

655
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:59,600
are flattering you now.

656
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,470
Tomorrow,

657
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,750
they may say

658
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,430
you killed 250 Yin Pei.

659
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,510
Later, they’ll make you
the Head of All Sects.

660
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,510
Then the Demons or other evils

661
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,750
coming out of nowhere

662
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,320
will come to ask you for trouble.

663
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,840
In a few more days,

664
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,470
you may be known

665
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,600
as a man

666
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,230
who has a great reputation,

667
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,190
but poor ability

668
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:27,020
just because of mere trifles.

669
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,220
You’ll be the second Huo Liantao.

670
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,160
Don’t worry.

671
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,320
Like Yin Pei and Huo Liantao,

672
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,360
people choose to be good or evil

673
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,120
within thoughts.

674
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,600
I know

675
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,640
very well

676
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,030
about the martial world.

677
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,920
Fine.

678
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,560
Be very careful.

679
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,880
Don’t get yourself killed
in the middle of night

680
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,080
after so many schemes.

681
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:13,660
(Brilliant Prospects)

682
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:14,320
(Liu’s Manor)

683
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,320
(Liu’s Manor)
Mr. Zou, if you have any trouble,

684
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,710
don’t hesitate to come to me.

685
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:18,920
I will.

686
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,120
Mr. Zou.

687
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,470
Please wait.

688
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:27,160
Miss Wu, what do you want me for?

689
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,360
Do you have time?

690
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,080
May I have a word with you?

691
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,320
I’ve got something to do.
I’ll leave you alone.

692
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,710
Mr. Zou, to be honest,

693
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:39,990
I’ve been compiling martial books.

694
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:42,270
I saw you fight with Iron-masked Demons.

695
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:43,670
I really admired that.

696
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,880
I wonder

697
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,600
if you want to tell me
your martial arts.

698
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,840
I’ll record them

699
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,210
so that they can be passed down.

700
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,640
It’s so farsighted of you, Miss Wu.

701
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,840
I have planned to do this.

702
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,120
You flatter me.

703
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:59,190
We’re a small sect.

704
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:02,190
But our ancestors established it
with painstaking efforts.

705
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,950
Now, my family has been ruined.

706
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:09,920
I fear our martial arts will be lost.

707
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,320
Don’t worry.

708
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,030
I’ll sort them out
as carefully as I can.

709
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,920
Mr. Yang.

710
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:20,190
You’re leaving?

711
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,190
I’m going back home.

712
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:30,030
Come on.

713
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:31,600
You’re just going
to the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

714
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,990
Go if you want.

715
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:33,950
I’m not going there!

716
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:35,880
When you’re not there, why am I going?

717
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:38,190
We’re not there.

718
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:40,640
But someone else is.

719
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,400
Yin Wenlan suddenly visited me

720
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,640
and gave me
the Manual of the Mountain Sword.

721
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,190
He asked me

722
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,840
to give it to his descendants

723
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,030
if he died.

724
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,920
He must have known

725
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,470
he was very likely to die

726
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:10,030
when being involved in the secret
of the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

727
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,880
No other martial artists knew it.

728
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,360
But I’ve kept the secret
for over twenty years.

729
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:27,090
After considering carefully about it,

730
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,120
I think

731
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,220
I should give it to you.
