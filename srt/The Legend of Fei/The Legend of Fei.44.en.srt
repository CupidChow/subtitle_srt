=Episode 44=

17
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,450
What happened?

18
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,380
Aunt!

19
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,090
She had fainted

20
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,020
when I arrived.

21
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,450
The suspect is gone.

22
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,060
How’s my mother?

23
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,660
She’s poisoned

24
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,580
with something unknown yet.

25
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,660
Thankfully,

26
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,410
it hasn’t damaged her heart vessels

27
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,850
and only put her into a coma.

28
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,380
We must know what it is

29
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,930
in order to remove it.

30
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,850
Who could break in

31
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,450
and poison her?

32
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,620
Who did this?

33
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,530
I saw a woman.

34
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,860
She was fast.

35
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,170
Most people couldn’t have done that.

36
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,810
The poison

37
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,980
must’ve been planted in the candle.

38
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,810
Luckily, Aunt found out

39
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,500
and cut it.

40
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,980
It’s the same method

41
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,090
Pathetic Clam used

42
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,730
to kill Mu Xiaoqiao.

43
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,570
Candle.

44
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,170
That snake keeper said

45
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,090
the Big Medicine Valley

46
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,900
invented such a poisoning method.

47
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,000
This needle

48
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,620
is also the same as
what Pathetic Clam used

49
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,170
back at the Small Medicine Valley.

50
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,350
Wasn’t she

51
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,710
killed by Phoenix?

52
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,240
Obviously,

53
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,990
she’s still alive.

54
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,400
Plus Phoenix did say

55
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,470
he didn’t see her face clearly

56
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,350
when he killed her.

57
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,120
Why would she

58
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,910
Poison Madam Li?

59
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,190
She could fail

60
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,210
and get caught by us.

61
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,660
All for the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

62
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,260
(Nine Moves of the Snow-breaking Blade)

63
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,020
(To Zhou Fei)

64
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,990
Fei.

65
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,240
This is Aunt’s letter to you.

66
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,270
Fei,

67
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,320
all the five tokens

68
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,630
are in Yitang’s favorite weiqi set.

69
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,800
The hidden compartment

70
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,600
has been emptied.

71
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,590
We can’t remove the poison

72
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,820
but only suppress it for now.

73
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,590
According to that snake keeper,

74
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,240
she only makes the poison

75
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,680
but not the antidote.

76
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,000
I don’t buy it.

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,960
Once we seize that habitual poisoner,

78
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,280
there must be a solution.

79
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,800
We had the gate closed

80
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,750
on our way here.

81
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,720
She might still be here.

82
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,720
Sheng, let’s split up.

83
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,520
You go to the front gate

84
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,590
while I check the other routes.

85
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,000
Sure.

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,310
Let’s go.

87
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,240
Take care of my mother.

88
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,680
Pass my order.

89
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,630
Form search teams.

90
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,840
Don’t act alone,

91
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,910
or they might be in danger.

92
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,030
Yes.

93
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,630
Don’t worry. I’m here to help.

94
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,000
I was just told to search the area...

95
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,520
Hold on.

96
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,280
That can’t be right.

97
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,680
Let’s go to the Hall of Elders.

98
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,520
Close the gate to seize suspects.

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,280
Be patient.

100
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,400
You guys check the front side.

101
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,750
You people go to the riverside.

102
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,470
Check carefully.

103
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,400
Leave no stone unturned.

104
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,440
-Yes.
-Lord,

105
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,680
we should’ve left earlier.

106
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,840
Now, they’re on alert.

107
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,720
We can’t leave.

108
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,070
Don’t worry.

109
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,350
Wait until

110
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,840
they catch that useless prince.

111
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,590
That’ll be our best chance to escape.

112
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,310
The rest of you
go to the front gate with me.

113
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,240
Yes!

114
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,030
Wait. I still feel worried.

115
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:56,720
Take some men with you

116
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,070
and check that route again.

117
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,520
The one taken by the enemies last time?

118
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,120
Outsiders couldn’t have found it.

119
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,520
Check again, just in case.

120
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,470
-Yes.
-Let’s go.

121
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,870
Come.

122
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,240
This is it. Guard the exit.

123
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,070
Yes!

124
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,150
I meant to leave in disguise

125
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,590
but they left me no choice.

126
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,030
They had it coming.

127
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,150
(Insightful and Open-minded)
How could this happen?

128
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,280
What to do?

129
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,030
Sheng,

130
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,440
is Madam really...

131
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,310
Yang Jin, tell them everything

132
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,400
about what happened
in the Hall of Elders.

133
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,120
I was practicing skills with others

134
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,440
before hearing
the Hall of Elders was robbed

135
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,680
and came over.

136
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,280
After searching,
that Mountain-River Jade

137
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,000
was lost.

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,190
Who’s the guard there today?

139
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,960
-It’s... It’s...
-Is it you?

140
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,630
It’s me.

141
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,240
How dare you stop the Third Prince!

142
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,590
This is an act of treason!

143
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,150
We’re following Madam’s order.

144
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,440
The gate is locked for tonight.

145
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,240
No one shall leave.

146
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,520
Young man,

147
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,240
His Highness

148
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,350
is Madam Li’s guest.

149
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,520
There must be a misunderstanding

150
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,630
for you to hold us up.

151
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,240
Here’s the thing, Mr. Bai,

152
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,680
a thief broke in

153
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,870
and stole Madam’s birthday gift

154
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,390
from His Highness,

155
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,000
hence the lockdown

156
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,590
to capture that person.

157
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,760
I’m the last person you should halt.

158
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,830
Would I take back

159
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,200
what I had given to others?

160
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,320
I apologize, Your Highness.

161
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,760
Before the truth comes out,

162
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,640
no one is allowed to leave.

163
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,880
Alright.

164
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,320
Since you’re on a search mission,

165
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,240
search us first.

166
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,760
If we don’t have

167
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,350
what you’re looking for,

168
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,910
please

169
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,350
report to Madam Li and Miss Zhou

170
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,830
to let us leave.

171
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,390
I’m sorry.

172
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,030
Go!

173
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,030
Yes!

174
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,760
It’s alright.

175
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,270
Let them do their job.

176
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,950
We have nothing to hide.

177
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,240
This is it!

178
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,000
Found it!

179
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,150
Mountain-River Jade!

180
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,470
Take them to the Hall of Elders.

181
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,120
-Yes.
-Yes.

182
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,880
Smells like knockout drops.

183
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,590
Knockout drops?

184
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,680
From whom?

185
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,510
Knockout drops.

186
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,030
What happened before you passed out?

187
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,080
I think

188
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,710
I saw a girl.

189
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,440
She was a new face

190
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,800
and couldn’t be our own member.

191
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,440
Hey, you.

192
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,390
Mr. Xie.

193
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,760
What happened here?

194
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,240
Where’s Zhou Fei?

195
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,120
Madam...

196
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,390
Madam was poisoned.

197
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,710
Miss Zhou is looking for the poisoner.

198
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,950
Poisoned?

199
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,590
Yes, by the Demons.

200
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,640
Elder Zhang has had all members

201
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,680
search for those bad people.

202
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,950
Oh, no!

203
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:25,830
Zichen!

204
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,800
The gate is closed.

205
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,830
This is the only exit.

206
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,640
Pathetic Clam.

207
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,560
Seize them all!

208
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,470
They colluded with Pathetic Clam

209
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,030
and poisoned Madam

210
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,710
Please calm down.

211
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,440
There must be a mistake.

212
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,030
We can explain

213
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,910
to Madam Li.

214
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,910
You evil thieves!

215
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,080
No wonder you were in a rush to leave.

216
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,910
That explains it.

217
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,590
Seize them!

218
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,000
Go!

219
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,710
Hold on.

220
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,440
Xie Yun.

221
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,470
Mr. Xie,

222
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,640
what are you doing?

223
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,390
Elder Zhang,

224
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,950
I can vouch for him with my life.

225
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,240
The Third Prince knows nothing about it.

226
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,240
Mr. Xie, you don’t know.

227
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,760
I’ve just found out

228
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,200
that he took Pathetic Clam here

229
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,640
who poisoned Madam.

230
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,680
You... Move!

231
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,800
Elder Zhang, think about it.

232
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,560
They were never on bad terms.

233
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,640
Why would a prince

234
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,000
hurt her?

235
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,830
The rich and powerful

236
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,440
are a bunch of evil bastards.

237
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,510
Who knows what they’re up to?

238
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,150
Speak!

239
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,800
Did your father

240
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,510
give you the order?

241
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,270
I’m here to propose marriage.

242
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,910
I swear I mean no harm.

243
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,950
That’s your excuse

244
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,390
to bring Pathetic Clam in

245
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,880
to poison Madam.

246
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,510
You’re in cahoots. Stop denying it!

247
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,680
-No way.
-I...

248
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,080
There’s a long-running feud
between the Chens and the Demons.

249
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,240
That woman must’ve

250
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,440
set the Third Prince up.

251
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,390
Xie Yun,

252
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,510
step aside,

253
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,760
or you’re leaving me no choice

254
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,390
but to kill you, too!

255
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,880
Us colluding with Demons

256
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,000
is utter nonsense!

257
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,470
That aside,

258
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,350
why are you blaming Xie Yun, too?

259
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,240
Zichen,

260
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,000
enough. Just go.

261
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,440
Now!

262
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,680
Capture them!

263
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,200
Master Zhang.

264
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,760
Sheng.

265
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,560
Mr. Xie meant well.

266
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,590
Drop your spear.

267
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,350
Sheng,

268
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,270
he did help us out once,

269
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,910
but Madam was poisoned

270
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,240
by his friend.

271
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,880
How could you trust him?

272
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,800
Master Zhang,

273
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,510
don’t jump to conclusions.

274
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,150
Calm down.

275
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,800
Your Highness,
where are the two doctors?

276
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,470
They left to wait for us outside.

277
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,880
Your Highness, in this case,

278
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,760
that doctor who showed up uninvited

279
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,910
must be Pathetic Clam.

280
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,440
She disguised herself

281
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,150
and sneaked in

282
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,590
in the name of
treating the Third Prince.

283
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,120
She stole the tokens,

284
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,270
and poisoned Aunt,

285
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,000
pinning everything
on the Third Prince

286
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,390
to play us off against each other

287
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,590
in favor of her.

288
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,390
If her plot worked

289
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,080
that the court and our Fortress
were against each other,

290
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,830
the masses would suffer.

291
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,390
Your Highness,

292
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,800
you may leave.

293
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,200
I’m really sorry.

294
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,080
And I’ll make it up to you.

295
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,590
Pathetic Clam is well-prepared

296
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:27,440
and must’ve been long gone.

297
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,880
Fei is out looking for her.

298
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,030
We’re going to help her

299
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,510
catch that woman.

300
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,760
She’s there alone?

301
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,240
Yes. I’m not sure where she is now

302
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,680
and I’m worried.

303
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,800
Mr. Xie!

304
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,710
My lady, let’s take a break.

305
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,350
We’ve been on the move almost all night.

306
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,270
No one is behind us.

307
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,120
We’ve gotten rid of

308
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,000
those of the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight.

309
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,950
With the tokens on me,

310
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,830
the quicker we get back, the better.

311
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,270
Once we get out of this area,

312
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,210
reinforcements will come.

313
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,200
Do you think I’m afraid of the hunters?

314
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,590
It’s the so-called reinforcements.

315
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:14,440
We can’t afford to lose the tokens.

316
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,390
Once we’re out of the woods,

317
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:19,320
contact our agents immediately

318
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,510
and ask them to report to Lord.

319
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,510
Yes.

320
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,000
Rest here for a while.

321
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,830
I’ll go get water.

322
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,150
Miss Zhou,

323
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,590
without me,

324
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,950
your mother will die.

325
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,710
Let me go

326
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,120
in exchange for the antidote
to Worry-burying.

327
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,240
So that’s what she’s with.

328
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
Aren’t you said

329
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,080
to only make the poison

330
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,240
but not the antidote?

331
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,240
That said,

332
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,240
still...

333
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,350
Cut to the chase.

334
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,760
Give me the antidote

335
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,120
if you want to live.

336
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,440
Wait.

337
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,390
There’s a cure.

338
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,150
Tell me about it.

339
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,590
I’ll make my own judgment.

340
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,080
The Color of Ocean and Heaven.

341
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,640
Find the treasure.

342
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,440
That’ll cure your mother.

343
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,120
That again!

344
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,950
Don’t you have anything new?

345
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,710
I’m telling you the truth.

346
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,440
Years of working with poison

347
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,110
is killing me slowly.

348
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,560
That treasure is my only cure.

349
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,440
That’s why I need the tokens.

350
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,110
Where are they?

351
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,510
Drop your blade

352
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,030
and I’ll give them to you.

353
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,720
Here they are.

354
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,060
(Animal characters made by CG)

355
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,680
Fei.

356
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:19,960
Fei!

357
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,080
It’s my fault.

358
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,840
I failed to protect Madam

359
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,150
and got her poisoned.

360
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,270
Don’t be too hard on yourself, Dan.

361
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,510
Nobody could

362
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,600
anticipate that.

363
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,800
No.

364
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,150
I should have.

365
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,510
I knew they had attempted
to kill Lord Gantang,

366
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,200
and they would

367
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,800
take further action here.

368
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,230
Uncle was under attack?

369
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,410
What happened?

370
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,080
Yesterday,

371
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,870
Yu Wenzhi’s spy was caught outside

372
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:10,270
who failed to assassinate Lord Gantang

373
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,680
and was there

374
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,960
searching for him.

375
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,270
Lord asked us to keep it from you

376
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,390
and look for him secretly

377
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,390
to contain panic.

378
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,560
In this case,

379
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:26,270
the theft and the assassination

380
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,480
must be related.

381
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,090
They can’t be a coincidence.

382
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,750
They must’ve plotted all that long ago.

383
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,630
I thought so.

384
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,390
I interrogated that spy, too.

385
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,720
But he claimed that
he wasn’t aware of the theft.

386
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:43,710
Didn’t Madam and Lord Gantang
have a pact?

387
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,440
He’s survived

388
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,000
and so will Madam.

389
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,560
She certainly will.

390
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,390
You good-for-nothing!

391
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,990
I’m sorry. Please calm down.

392
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,360
Don’t be mad.

393
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,070
The old and new dynasties
are supposed to be mortal enemies.

394
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,280
How come Xiao Chuan
is unaffected?

395
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,510
That walking dead

396
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,030
keeps spoiling my plan.

397
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,320
Xiao Chuan!

398
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,320
Send a message to Shen Tianshu

399
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,360
that I’ll agree to his condition

400
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,360
if he gets rid of Xiao Chuan for me.

401
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,870
Lord Shen has arrived at Hanshui Town.

402
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,440
I heard

403
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,600
Lord Hu had obtained

404
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,560
all five tokens.

405
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,870
He’s there to pick her up.

406
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,020
I knew Tianying would make it.

407
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,700
Xiao Chuan!

408
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,720
Madam is still in a coma.

409
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,630
Her condition is critical.

410
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,150
I’m entrusting the Fortress to you.

411
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,910
No need to tell us that.

412
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,080
It’s our job.

413
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,800
Where’s Fei?

414
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,270
She’s left to capture Pathetic Clam.

415
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:05,030
I’m going to join her.

416
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:06,330
Sure.

417
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,970
I’ll go with you.

418
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,660
Here are a few things
that require your attention.

419
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,010
Pathetic Clam managed to escape

420
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,580
but she might not have gone far.

421
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,210
It’s still our territory outside.

422
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,700
But the Demons might’ve

423
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,370
arranged people to get her out.

424
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,180
Those bastards!

425
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,660
They should know

426
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,130
we aren’t afraid of them!

427
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,210
Yes. We aren’t.

428
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,580
We’ll fight them to the end!

429
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,970
Elder Zhang,

430
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:34,540
what if Shen Tianshu comes in person?

431
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,490
Yang Jin and I

432
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:40,130
will leave with our crack troops

433
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,420
to join Fei to capture Pathetic Clam.

434
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,250
It’s not safe inside or outside.

435
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,940
I have great respect for you.

436
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,370
Please guard the Fortress with others

437
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,480
to prevent another attack.

438
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,180
Thank you.

439
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,210
No need.

440
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,820
That’s what we should do.

441
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,090
Consider it done.

442
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:00,810
That’s our duty.

443
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,900
Chuchu.

444
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,610
Take care of my aunt.

445
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,610
I will.

446
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,730
Where are Xie Yun and Yan?

447
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,540
Mr. Xie has left to find Fei.

448
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,610
There’s still no news from him.
I’m worried.

449
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:17,250
As for Yan, wasn’t she out shopping?

450
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,820
Mr. Xie said

451
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,330
she’d be back today.

452
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,700
I hope she’ll be fine.

453
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,180
That girl.

454
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,250
How’s she?

455
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,850
Her pulse is as weak as yesterday.

456
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,460
Right now, it’s only a coma,

457
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,580
but it might get worse tomorrow.

458
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,780
Back then

459
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,780
when Old Master was poisoned
by Pathetic Clam,

460
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,050
there was nothing
our physicians could do.

461
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,210
Don’t give up hope yet.

462
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,930
The tougher the situation is,

463
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,640
the more united we should be.

464
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:06,360
All we can do is to guard the fort

465
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,730
to not hold Zhou Fei and Li Sheng back.

00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,730
following me all the way here.

520
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,330
I’ll spare you

521
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,180
so that you can
report back to your leader

522
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,490
to leave me alone.

523
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:38,300
Or the Route Gang will soon be gone.

524
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,730
Yes. Yes.

525
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:43,110
Piss off!

526
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,210
Lord.

527
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,370
The Route Gang never dared to offend us.

528
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,060
This time...

529
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,540
That was for the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight.

530
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,210
Urge Gu Tianxian

531
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,460
to come quickly with his force.

532
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:02,420
Yes.

533
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,420
Mr. Li.

534
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,370
You again!

535
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,420
What are you still doing here?

536
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,660
Mr. Bai,

537
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,540
have you found those female doctors?

538
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,780
Mr. Li,

539
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,580
it was my negligence

540
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,820
that led to

541
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,300
Madam being poisoned.

542
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,580
My death isn’t enough
to cover the damage.

543
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,540
But the Third Prince asked me

544
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,010
to help you

545
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,900
to redeem myself.

546
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,250
Whatever you need me to do,

547
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,250
I won’t say no to it.

548
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,730
How can I trust you?

549
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,700
I was the head of the White Bat
of the Route Gang.

550
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,370
Its business covers the entire state.

551
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,940
I still have influence

552
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,850
in the Gang.

553
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,370
What can you

554
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:54,250
do for me?

555
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,730
The Route Gang

556
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,420
isn’t known for its force,

557
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,850
but it excels at

558
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,250
gathering information.

559
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,610
News just came in

560
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,180
that Shen Tianshu of Demons Manor

561
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,780
is heading this way.

562
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,730
How many people are there with him?

563
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,330
Only enough to form a squad,

564
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,780
but Gu Tianxian

565
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,180
and the main force is right behind.

566
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,820
It seems that

567
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,090
they’re meeting in Hanshui Town.

568
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:18,940
Luckily, Yang Jin

569
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,130
has left to contact our secret service.

570
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,780
Mr. Bai,

571
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,850
please come with me.

572
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,420
I’m going to need your help.

573
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,300
Mr. Li,

574
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,180
I’m asked

575
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,700
to do my best to help you.

576
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,730
Whatever you need,

577
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:35,970
just let me know.

578
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,780
Search this place!

579
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,060
Find that girl of the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight

580
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,330
even if you have to
tear this town apart.

581
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,330
Yes!

582
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,960
(East Point)

583
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,900
-This way.
-Let’s go.

584
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,660
-Follow me.
-Yes.

585
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,010
Take that way.

586
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:55,970
Over there.

587
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:58,850
That girl of the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight?

588
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,090
Do they mean Fei?

589
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,540
Is she also here?

590
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:08,940
Have you checked that way?

591
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,330
-Come here.
-Yes.

592
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,090
Sir.

593
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,300
Come here.

594
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:42,730
Found anything in the front?

595
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,660
The Demons are all over the place.

596
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,060
You aren’t a local, are you?

597
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,010
No.

598
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:48,850
Listen,

599
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,970
here isn’t safe lately.

600
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:53,370
Don’t wander about at night.

601
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,540
Search it!

602
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,370
Come in.

603
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,420
Where are we?

604
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,820
Those Demons

605
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,580
show up out of the blue.

606
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,300
Demons?

607
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,330
They’re our Fortress’s mortal enemies.

608
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,090
Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

609
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:20,940
Just now, you were out there alone,

610
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,180
looking around.

611
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,090
What if they saw you

612
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,940
and caught you?

613
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,730
Don’t worry.

614
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:27,900
They wouldn’t dare.

615
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,250
Those notorious villains

616
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,490
would catch everyone in sight

617
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,180
regardless of who they are.

618
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,460
Are you afraid of them?

619
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,700
Our people can deal with them.

620
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,610
As experienced as they seem,

621
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:41,210
my brother and cousin

622
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,010
killed three of them
soon after they left home.

623
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:45,490
Now, only four Demons are left.

624
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:49,010
Why are you hiding here?

625
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,300
I...

626
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,210
I’m outnumbered.

627
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,610
We can hide here for now.

628
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,540
I’ll take you

629
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,010
to our secret meeting point later.

630
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:00,420
We’ll be safe there.

631
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,780
It was dangerous!

632
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,180
The minute the map popped open,

633
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,660
it burned my hands.

634
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:09,330
Who else was there?

635
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,970
Poisoner Ying Hecong,

636
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,900
that bonehead of the Cloud Ravine

637
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,730
and a girl of the Fortress
of the Forty-Eight.

638
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,490
She cared a lot

639
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,490
about that map.

640
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,490
Liu Youliang risked his own life

641
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,700
to help them escape.

642
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,610
Is she that girl

643
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,090
Tong Tianyang said?

644
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,940
How come

645
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,090
they sent you here alone?

646
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,660
Don’t be scared.

647
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,780
It’s not the same.

648
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,840
What if I ran into Shen Tianshu?

649
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,960
You don’t know how scary he is, do you?

650
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:48,820
Alright.

651
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,780
Tell me about it.

652
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,010
How is he scary?

653
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,370
It’s said that man

654
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,580
is invincible.

655
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,010
He’s a highly skilled killing machine

656
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:05,180
and an evil

657
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,580
ringleader.

658
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,780
Sir,

659
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,060
if you see him,

660
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,780
run as fast as you can.

661
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:12,850
I’m starving.

662
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,010
Try it.

663
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,460
It’s the specialty here.

664
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,330
Just take it.

665
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,060
You seem old.

666
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,540
Why are you out alone?

667
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,130
Aren’t your family worried?

668
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,660
I have none.

669
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,700
They all died

670
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,490
because of the war years back.

671
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,130
Oh.

672
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,540
I’m sorry.

673
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,250
Are you sad all these years?

674
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,370
There are other ways

675
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:50,970
to gain happiness
other than being with family.

676
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,060
Isn’t it also fun to gain power?

677
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,540
They’re two different things.

678
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,820
To gain power,

679
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,700
you have to fight for what you want.

680
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,250
Even if you win the whole world,

681
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,250
it comes at a price.

682
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,130
That’s different

683
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,610
from being loved and cared for.

684
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,610
Take my cousin
and cousin-in-law as an example.

685
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,220
Before she said

686
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,660
what she wanted,

687
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,810
my cousin-in-law had found it for her.

688
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,330
When he was sick,

689
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,900
my cousin would save him with her life.

690
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,850
Only you naive kids

691
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,850
would believe that.

692
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,460
That’s not true.

693
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,260
Sir,

694
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,570
you would, too, if you were there.

695
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,940
I envy them.

696
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:38,130
Your cousin-in-law probably wouldn’t.

697
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,420
Are you a veteran?

698
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,220
How so?

699
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,180
Things you said about power

700
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,570
gave you away.

701
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,660
Why are you here?

702
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,290
I used to

703
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,290
serve in the Anping Army.

704
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,610
I’m here

705
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:59,460
to visit an old comrade.

706
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,500
Anping Army?

707
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,500
No way!

708
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,190
That’s my uncle’s...

709
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,860
♪Enlisted at 15♪

710
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,860
♪Only to return at 80♪

711
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,410
♪Asked a townsman on the way back♪

712
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,810
♪Who’s left back home♪

713
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,740
What’s that song?

714
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,850
It’s beautiful.

715
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,810
Song of Anping.

716
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,850
Song of Anping.

717
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,490
How come it sounds familiar?

718
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,490
It’s been over 20 years.

719
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,170
Things in the army

720
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:52,180
have become vague

721
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:55,090
except for this song.

722
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,930
I still remember it.

723
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,260
Oh, no!

724
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,770
The Demons are nearby.

725
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,980
What if they heard the song

726
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,180
and came in this direction?

727
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,180
They wouldn’t.

728
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,220
Let’s go.

729
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:10,530
Come.

730
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:11,420
Alright.

731
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:20,530
I’ll drop you

732
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,050
at our meeting point first.

733
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,770
It’s safer there.

734
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:33,770
Stop.

735
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,530
Where are you going this late?

736
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,770
Sirs,

737
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,460
my grandfather and I
are going to the morning market.

738
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,530
Are you going there, too?

739
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,220
Yes.

740
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,330
What a coincidence!

741
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:59,050
We’re leaving.

742
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,050
What’s going on?

743
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,420
How do you feel?

744
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,740
Better now?

745
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:05,980
Much better.

746
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,660
The Route Gang said

747
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,850
they had found traces of Pathetic Clam.

748
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:18,500
She seems to be heading to Hanshui Town.

749
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,020
Fei,

750
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,610
you must be the only one

751
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,700
who can still be so energetic

752
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,370
after being poisoned by Pathetic Clam.

753
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,980
I’m afraid

754
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,530
there’s also bad news.

755
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,570
Shen Tianshu is there already.

756
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,660
He’s fast.

757
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,020
Look,

758
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,900
we must get rid of her

759
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,420
before Shen Tianshu finds her.

760
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,980
Or it’ll be more difficult

761
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,180
once they get together.

762
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,610
Fei,

763
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:56,500
it’s too risky

764
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,260
to act alone.

765
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,260
Why don’t we

766
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,850
go back to the Fortress

767
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:03,420
to join the others first?

768
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,570
They left after us.

769
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:09,580
It’d be too late when they arrived.

770
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:13,130
Let’s go

771
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,770
and try to stop her halfway.

772
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,610
Even if we failed,

773
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:18,290
that’d still buy us time

774
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,050
to wait for backups.

775
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:25,180
Alright. You have a point.

776
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,610
I know you’re worried about me.

777
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:32,050
That woman is nothing

778
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:37,370
without her tricks and poison.

779
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:39,610
As long as I stay alert

780
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,660
and protect myself from them,

781
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:44,330
there’s a chance to win.

782
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,050
Her poison won’t be a problem.

783
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,460
You have me.

784
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,680
I’m your anti-poison armor.

785
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:57,220
You’re the sharp blade

786
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,530
while I’m the unbreakable shield.

787
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,320
Use her poison

788
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,920
against her

789
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,360
to not waste

790
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,510
the deadliest Bone-chilling she gave me.

791
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,950
Fine. Next time, when we see her,

792
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,080
we’ll waste no time

793
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,030
and take care of her first.

794
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:19,990
Deal.

795
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,230
Xie Yun,

796
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,710
hypothetically,

797
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,560
if one day,

798
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,430
I died,

799
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,990
what would you do?

800
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,920
That’d be my bliss.

801
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,470
I’d

802
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:53,080
have fun in every possible way

803
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,920
together with your share.

804
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:58,550
Live my life to the fullest

805
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,560
to not waste any second.

806
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,510
Bastard!

807
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:06,750
Fei,

808
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,030
you know

809
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:11,360
I’m a coward

810
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,750
struggling to live in chaos.

811
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:16,360
But after being through
so much with you,

812
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,320
I’ve got used to

813
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,230
putting my life on the line

814
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,160
and I’ve grown more guts.

815
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,320
Really?

816
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,950
Let me see.

817
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,430
Show me.

818
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,710
Wait... wait until they grow even more.

819
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:34,320
(Intelligent and Ingenious)
Senior Master Li.

820
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,670
Goodness!

821
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,270
Why are you still here?

822
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:40,920
You know what,

823
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,400
I almost got caught before the gate

824
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,640
and managed to pull through.

825
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,510
By the way, I got an elder out, too.

826
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,510
Look.

827
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,320
What’s wrong?

828
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,670
My mouth is dry after all the hiding.

829
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,990
We’re safe here.

830
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,430
We can rest at Senior Master Li’s store.

831
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,470
He once

832
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,670
fought against Shen Tianshu.

833
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:26,710
Really?

834
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,800
Of course.

835
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,400
Hey,

836
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,120
didn’t you say

837
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,430
you’re here to visit an old comrade?

838
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:33,950
Who is he?

839
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:39,160
Liu Youliang.

840
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,320
You...

841
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,430
You’re Timber Wolf, Shen Tianshu!

842
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,750
Young lady,

843
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:56,670
I wish

844
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:58,360
you didn’t recognize me.

845
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,950
Go, Yan!

846
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:07,030
Hello, dear.

847
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,080
Where are you going?

848
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,430
(Wood Workshop)
I poisoned Li Jinrong

849
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:42,920
to get the tokens out.

850
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,990
Her people

851
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,400
will soon find us.

852
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,080
We’d better leave now.

853
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,800
Not yet.

854
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,600
Gu Tianxian is on the way.

855
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,080
I need some answers

856
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,400
before we go.

857
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,320
Mr. Li, Mr. Yang,

858
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,560
we tried to follow him

859
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,080
but he’s too skilled.

860
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,320
I even lost a man

861
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,080
but still couldn’t get close to him.

862
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:27,750
Thank you.

863
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,640
Is something else bothering you?

864
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:34,120
I’m afraid

865
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,510
Yu Wenzhi’s force might also...

866
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:37,640
Yu Wenzhi?

867
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,640
Yes.

868
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,950
Him again.

869
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:42,230
One of my contacts

870
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:43,920
is Yu Wenzhi’s groom.

871
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,430
He told me a while ago

872
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:48,120
that Pathetic Clam

873
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,470
was incited by Yu Wenzhi.

874
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:51,920
He even

875
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,470
came to Shen Tianshu for it.

876
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:55,470
Unexpectedly,

877
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:58,710
Shen Tianshu used
Pathetic Clam’s life as leverage

878
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:01,360
and they almost fell out.

879
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:04,640
In that sense,

880
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,670
Pathetic Clam and Yu Wenzhi

881
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:09,560
worked together to steal the tokens

882
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,360
behind Shen Tianshu’s back.

883
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,270
Correct. All I know

884
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:15,840
is that Shen Tianshu

885
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,360
was so mad at Yu Wenzhi

886
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,850
that he almost refused

887
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:20,560
to come to save Pathetic Clam.

888
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:22,920
Mr. Li,

889
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,160
there’s nothing new

890
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,990
from my contact.

891
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,360
My concern is

892
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,400
if Yu Wenzhi’s force joins them,

893
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,320
our people

894
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,320
won’t be their match.

895
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,320
I can’t wait for a bigger mess.

896
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,800
Once he’s here,

897
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,030
he won’t let Shen Tianshu

898
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:45,560
take the tokens so easily

899
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,880
after all that he’s done.

900
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,510
When it’s dog-eat-dog between them,

901
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:51,840
we can take advantage of it.
