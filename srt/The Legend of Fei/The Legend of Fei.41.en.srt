on the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

93
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,140
Yeah.

94
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,160
Since the former dynasty,

95
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,950
it has been haunting people.

96
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,270
The Color of Ocean and Heaven
was the treasure

97
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,720
taken out of our palace in the mutiny.

98
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,110
My grandfather buried it,

99
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,830
so that his descendants can
bring about an upswing.

100
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,830
Sadly, time brings great changes.

101
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,440
An upswing is nothing,

102
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,060
but a dream.

103
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,840
So,

104
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,160
I deceived myself and escaped.

105
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,550
I don’t know why,

106
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,530
but the Demons knew about the secret

107
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,320
so that two generations
of martial artists were involved.

108
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,700
It also resulted

109
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,370
in Yin Pei’s tragic life.

110
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,490
The Color of Ocean and Heaven
belongs to the Xiao family.

111
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,960
I’m a descendant of the Xiao family.

112
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,240
I should have buried it.

113
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,890
Don’t think too much.

114
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,890
The Color of Ocean and Heaven
has involved the whole martial world.

115
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,570
It’s no longer related to you alone.

116
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,200
Every one of us

117
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,610
has the duty to guard it.

118
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:06,960
Yeah.

119
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,290
Let’s take it back

120
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,610
and think of a way to keep it

121
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,610
so that it won’t hurt more people.

122
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,010
Mr. Xie, don’t think too much.

123
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,290
To get the tokens,

124
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,120
the Demons attacked our Fortress
a few times.

125
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,120
As long as my aunt is there,

126
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,610
we’re never afraid.

127
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,850
Let’s first take the tokens back

128
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,640
and meet my mother.

129
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:39,540
(Hanshui Town)

130
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,490
Fei, you’re arriving home.

131
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,010
What’s on your mind?

132
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,290
I’m thinking...

133
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,680
I’ve been away from home
for such a long time.

134
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,400
When I suddenly go back,

135
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,360
I wonder

136
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,920
if she will beat me.

137
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,240
I don’t think she’ll beat you.

138
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,520
But she’ll certainly kick me out.

139
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,290
Think about it.

140
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,360
I first persuaded your father to leave.

141
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,200
Then I took you away.

142
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,960
Think about these things...

143
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,170
Screwed.

144
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,170
What if your mother really beats me?

145
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,730
I can’t run away this time.

146
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,570
I don’t know what to do, either.

147
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,850
No way!

148
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,490
I must think of a way

149
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,450
to flatter your mother.

150
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,570
When you annoyed your mother,

151
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,120
how did you make her happy?

152
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,120
I never tried to make her happy.

153
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,010
Only my father can make her happy.

154
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,570
Go ask him.

155
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,520
Forget it.

156
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,490
I’ll figure out a way myself.

157
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,520
Shall I write an opera

158
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,680
to flatter her?

159
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,610
Don’t worry.

160
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,490
When I write it personally,

161
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,290
I’m sure I’ll spread her fame

162
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,120
throughout the world.

163
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,730
Then my mother will surely kill you.

164
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,610
I can’t help you, then.

165
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,520
Fei, don’t leave me alone.

166
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,800
He... he again?

167
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,050
Hurry! Hurry!

168
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:33,880
Run!

169
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,610
Don’t go!

170
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,440
Let’s fight again.

171
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,400
No.

172
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,930
-Bonehead.
-Yan?

173
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,440
Are you challenging them again?

174
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,730
Yeah.

175
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,170
They’re so scared of you.

176
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,880
How will they compete with you again?

177
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,520
Yeah, Mr. Yang.

178
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,050
We won’t compete with you.

179
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,370
But aren’t martial artists supposed to

180
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,490
compete with each other,

181
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,810
regardless of life?

182
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,730
Yeah.

183
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:02,930
Mr. Yang.

184
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,400
We’ll go and guard the gate.

185
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,610
-We’ll leave you alone.
-We’ll leave you alone.

186
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,490
Go. Go.

187
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,170
Don’t go!

188
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,130
How about this?

189
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:09,960
If you defeat me,

190
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,400
I’ll guard the gate for you for one day.

191
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,290
Come on.

192
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,080
You always say that.

193
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,880
But have you ever lost?

194
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,930
Let’s go. Go.

195
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,640
People with your sect

196
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,200
don’t practice martial arts every day.

197
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,080
And you don’t have courage at all!

198
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,810
Bonehead, what did you say?

199
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,440
Are you risking your neck?

200
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,080
-Mr. Yang, it’s a deal, then.
-Let’s fight.

201
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,880
-Decide the days on the number of us.
-Sounds interesting.

202
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,200
-Guard the gate for one day if you win.
-Yan.

203
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,370
-Come. Come.
-If we win,

204
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,140
-guard the gate for three days, okay?
-You’ve come, too?

205
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,400
All right.

206
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,880
Wait a minute.

207
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,170
Why must I guard the guard anyway?

208
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,760
Whatever.

209
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,290
Elder Zhang is our judge.

210
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,640
Don’t waste our time.

211
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,640
Mr. Bai.

212
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,730
Give him a good lesson

213
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,400
so that he’ll suffer!

214
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,930
Watch it!

215
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,880
What? I didn’t agree to fight you.

216
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,730
-You!
-The others

217
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,400
don’t deserve my time.

218
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,170
What’s your look?

219
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,290
He can’t defeat me at all!

220
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,250
Fight me, all of you.

221
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,610
Run! Run! Run!

222
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,250
Get down!

223
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,640
Give in, won’t you?

224
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,130
Give in to your poor martial arts?

225
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,610
How are my martial arts?

226
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:11,880
Great!

227
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,730
Go.

228
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,320
Yan, don’t go too far.

229
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,370
Mr. Yang, we lost.

230
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,000
You won.

231
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,290
What about me? I won, too.

232
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,440
Whoever won will go guard the gate.

233
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,880
Go, then. Who cares?

234
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,690
Are you going?

235
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,130
-Yes!
-Go, then.

236
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,960
Wait.

237
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,760
Mr. Bai.

238
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,560
Were you hurt?

239
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,560
No.

240
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,560
Does he look like he was hurt?

241
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,400
Silly girl. Take this.

242
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,170
See you.

243
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,730
Take care.

244
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,370
Go.

245
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,320
Coming!

246
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,640
Madam.

247
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,850
Madam, what’s wrong?

248
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:25,880
Did you have a relapse

249
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,560
of the old wound?

250
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,640
I’m fine.

251
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,760
Madam.

252
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,290
Go back to your room for a rest.

253
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,690
I’ll go get you a doctor.

254
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,400
No.

255
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,930
Didn’t I tell you?

256
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,250
Don’t tell anyone I was wounded,

257
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,730
especially when I’m having a relapse.

258
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:45,640
Uh...

259
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,000
Shall we get back for some rest?

260
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,290
Come on.

261
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:07,880
Come over.

262
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,130
Is that Miss Zhou?

263
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,960
Looks like her.

264
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,560
I think so. Go have a look.

265
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,130
Who are those people over there?

266
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,850
Who are they?

267
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,730
I’ll go have a look.

268
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,690
Well, hand over the work to us.

269
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,320
We come to take the shift.

270
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,930
You’ll work personally?

271
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,850
And me.

272
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,200
Miss Li.

273
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,960
Miss Zhou and Mr. Li are back!

274
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,250
It’s them!

275
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,930
Miss Zhou and Mr. Li are back!

276
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,440
My brother and my cousin are back?

277
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,490
Oh,

278
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,490
go tell Madam Li.

279
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,320
Aye.

280
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:52,880
Brother!

281
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,370
Brother!

282
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,130
Fei!

283
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,440
You’re finally back.

284
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,930
What happened?

285
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,170
Why are you guarding the gate?

286
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,400
Where are the others?

287
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,320
You have no idea.

288
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,880
He has been asking everybody
for a competition.

289
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,130
Others are fed up with him.

290
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,640
They then asked him to guard the gate

291
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,960
each time he challenges others.

292
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,960
Then he keeps quiet for days.

293
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,640
I defeated him once.

294
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,960
Today, I guard the gate with him.

295
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,960
Very well.

296
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,440
When you help to guard the gate,

297
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,760
keep an eye on him.

298
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,000
Without my permission, he mustn’t leave.

299
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,250
You idiot!

300
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,690
I haven’t got in yet,

301
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,080
and you’re setting rules for me?

302
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,200
Don’t worry.

303
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,080
This is such a nice place.

304
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,930
Even if you kick me out,

305
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,130
I won’t leave.

306
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:57,810
Wonderful!

307
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,880
Aunt’s birthday is coming
in a couple of days.

308
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,930
I want to hold a big party for her.

309
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,520
You’re all back.

310
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,610
We’ll have fun this year!

311
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,930
Mother is having her birthday?

312
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,640
It’s the 13th day of the twelfth month
so soon?

313
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,760
Yeah.

314
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,440
You’ve been out of the Fortress.

315
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,490
You don’t even remember the date.

316
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,050
Let’s go.

317
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,170
Stay and work hard.

318
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,440
Guard the gate carefully.

319
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,850
Brother!

320
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,640
Chuchu.

321
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,520
Did you make trouble?

322
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,250
Did you?

323
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,640
Mother, we didn’t make trouble
when we were away.

324
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,170
Yeah, you didn’t.

325
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,320
You just punched Chu Tianyu,

326
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,880
killed Tong Tianyang

327
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,230
and fought against Lu Tiankuang.

328
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,850
They were mere Demons.

329
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,370
You always ran after danger?

330
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,700
You think you’re getting braver?

331
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,660
We were just going to tell you, Aunt.

332
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,220
We rushed all the way back

333
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,700
and didn’t even remember the date.

334
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,250
Luckily, we’re back in time

335
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,780
for your birthday.

336
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,250
Yeah, Madam.

337
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,580
Fei and Sheng were away from home
for such a long time.

338
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,100
They didn’t admit,
but they really missed you.

339
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:46,850
Right?

340
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,200
Take care of yourselves.

341
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,370
Don’t bother to miss me.

342
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,960
Chuchu.

343
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,200
You just learnt martial arts.

344
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,290
You had a hard time
when involved in so much trouble.

345
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,440
With everybody around,

346
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,650
we always came safely out of danger.

347
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,410
Madam.

348
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,440
Here we meet again.

349
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,770
Mother.

350
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,200
I asked him to come back with me.

351
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,960
I’ll get even with you later.

352
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,130
I heard about what had happened to you

353
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,490
through secret services.

354
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,770
You did a good job.

355
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,530
Demons like Tong Tianyang
should be killed.

356
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,130
Well done.

357
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,250
You didn’t disgrace our Fortress.

358
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,970
You also did a good job

359
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,800
in Liu’s Manor.

360
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,610
Thank you, Aunt.

361
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,440
Fei helped a lot

362
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,680
with many things.

363
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,890
You had a long trip.

364
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,080
Since you’re back,

365
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,800
have a good rest.

366
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,530
Mother.

367
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:08,440
We have brought you

368
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,730
several things.

369
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,010
What are they?

370
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,530
Tokens of the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

371
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,850
I didn’t expect Mr. Chongxiao’s whisk

372
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,200
to be the last token.

373
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,850
Destiny makes fool of us.

374
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,800
People who guard the tokens

375
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
were all dead for them.

376
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,160
Even Father and Jinfeng were...

377
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,040
To get these tokens,

378
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,650
the Demons did all the dirty things.

379
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,160
Unexpectedly,

380
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,440
we have all the tokens now.

381
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,850
Each token

382
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,010
has gone through blood.

383
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,650
For a legend that isn’t sure to be true,

384
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,730
so many people have been involved.

385
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,890
Mother.

386
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,250
Now,

387
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,160
we have all the tokens.

388
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,770
The Demons will come sooner or later.

389
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,770
We should have a plan
as soon as possible.

390
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,410
We’ve collected the tokens.

391
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,960
The truth will come out soon.

392
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,800
Madam.

393
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,130
The Color of Ocean and Heaven

394
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,010
was the hidden trouble
of the former dynasty.

395
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:26,200
It’s more or less related to me.

396
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,320
As for how to deal with the tokens,

397
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:28,800
do you think...?

398
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,770
Let me keep the things.

399
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,960
I’ll think about how to deal with them.

400
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,080
Don’t bother about it.

401
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,530
Fine. We’ll be at your service.

402
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,010
You may leave.

403
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:44,260
(Repenting Hall)

404
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,800
Father.

405
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,850
Jinrong.

406
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,530
Father, is this for me?

407
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,080
It’s kids’ stuff.

408
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,490
I’ll keep it for you.

409
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:02,920
When you want it,

410
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,650
I’ll give it to you.

411
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,010
You’ve given it to me.

412
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,370
You can’t take it back.

413
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,160
Put it away carefully.

414
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,040
Don’t let anyone see it.

415
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,530
Let me put it on you. Come on.

416
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,080
Father. Father!

417
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,040
You’re just in time.

418
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,800
Father.

419
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,250
We both use Snow-breaking Blade.

420
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,270
Why do I use it more poorly than you?

421
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,490
I’ve made a blouse for you.

422
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,200
Come and have a try.

423
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,160
Father. I’m no longer a kid.

424
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,610
I can make it if I need one.

425
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,080
Nonsense.

426
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,320
Look at your blouses.

427
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,490
The sleeves are so short.

428
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,280
But you haven’t made a new one.

429
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,250
A girl like you is so stubborn.

430
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,200
I wonder who you’re like.

431
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,610
How will you live your life
after getting married?

432
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:23,200
Yitang has a good temper.

433
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,080
Father.

434
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,610
Take it back and try it on.

435
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,250
I can alter it if it doesn’t fit you.

436
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,040
Come on.

437
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,040
Jinrong.

438
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,370
Father.

439
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,850
Even before you died,

440
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:44,010
you didn’t tell me
the truth of the Bracelet.

441
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,650
I know you didn’t want us
to be involved.

442
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,650
I’m now wounded.

443
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,530
If the Demons come again,

444
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,350
what do we do?

445
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,130
Can I still defeat Shen Tianshu?

446
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,130
Father.

447
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,200
You didn’t want
to leave the burden to me.

448
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,920
How can I leave it
to the younger generation?

449
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,680
Madam.

450
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,040
Come in.

451
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,680
Madam, you wanted to see me?

452
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,960
Dan.

453
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,650
Ask the secret services to gather spies

454
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,800
so that they can go to Demons Manor

455
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,730
and check what they’re doing.

456
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,250
Demons, what will they do?

457
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,770
Fei came back

458
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,560
with the other tokens
for the Color of Ocean and Heaven.

459
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,560
The Demons haven’t known it yet.

460
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,010
Once they know,

461
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,240
they’ll all come and fight us.

462
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:01,140
What are you going to do, then?

463
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,160
Since we steal a march on them,

464
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,280
we can’t await our doom.

465
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,560
Waiting for their attack
will be the worst plan.

466
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,440
We should fight them by surprise.

467
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,320
You want to go to Demons Manor

468
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,500
and screw their nest?

469
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,440
But Demons Manor is heavily guarded

470
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,890
with a large number of minions.

471
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,440
We don’t have enough men.

472
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,280
I’m afraid we can’t take them down.

473
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
No.

474
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,200
We can’t attack Demons Manor

475
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,080
with our men.

476
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,200
What if I sneak in alone

477
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,750
and assassinate Shen Tianshu?

478
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,000
When Shen Tianshu dies,

479
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,680
the Demons will collapse.

480
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,080
The problem will be solved once for all.

481
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,610
But Madam, this is too risky.

482
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,920
It’s worth a try.

483
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,610
If I don’t go,

484
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:53,560
our place will be in danger.

485
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
Madam.

486
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,560
Think carefully about it.

487
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,850
You want to risk your life
to kill Shen Tianshu.

488
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,660
What do we do if you’re dead?

489
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:05,890
And Miss Zhou.

490
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,770
How sad she will be!

491
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,490
Madam.

492
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,850
Fei.

493
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,160
Do you remember the first time

494
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,530
I met you by Ximo River?

495
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:26,890
What?

496
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:29,440
You still miss the day
we risked the Spinning Wire Formation?

497
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,280
My cloud-impelling palm
isn’t unsurpassed.

498
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,530
But it is still unrivalled.

499
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,080
I nearly failed to dodge.

500
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,960
Weird.

501
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,920
When did you have a secret teacher

502
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,320
and learn this from him?

503
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,410
When I stayed with Mu Xiaoqiao,

504
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,890
we talked about 100 Destructive Palms.

505
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:58,610
I studied it by myself.

506
00:24:58,610 --> 00:24:59,730
But... wait...

507
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,370
Him?

508
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,370
What did you talk about?

509
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,160
Come on, Zhou Fei.

510
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,410
You shouldn’t have done that.

511
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,250
You used to be sparing in speech.

512
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,530
When I teased you,

513
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,940
you became angry.

514
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:17,010
Why did you talk so much
with someone else?

515
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,440
When?

516
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,680
When you lay in bed by the East Sea.

517
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,560
Good.

518
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,730
You did that when I couldn’t see you.

519
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,770
Wait...

520
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,130
You like a sexy man like him?

521
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:40,080
I can do this, too.

522
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,960
Behave yourself.

523
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,320
Fei.

524
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:59,850
I’m going
to take up my profession tomorrow,

525
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,800
living on writing operas.

526
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,770
It would be better

527
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,320
if I had my own troupe.

528
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,250
It would be the best

529
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,800
if we could stand up to Yuyi Troupe.

530
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,170
Here you go again.

531
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,490
Don’t you fear
my mother will punch you?

532
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,610
Well, before your mother finds it,

533
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,850
let’s run away

534
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:19,920
and travel all over the world.

535
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:23,890
No way.

536
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,530
My mother is having her birthday.

537
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,310
I’m afraid there’s much fun to see here.

538
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,610
Then after seeing the fun,

539
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,040
let’s leave

540
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,160
and travel around the world, okay?

541
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,410
We will go

542
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,890
to any place you like.

543
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:48,250
Go see the sea by Penglai Island,

544
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,490
go fishing by the Dongting Lake

545
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:50,920
and go basking in the south.

546
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,680
All right.

547
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,200
Let’s go basking in the south.

548
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,730
It’s good for your health.

549
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,130
There are many beautiful flowers

550
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,890
in the south,

551
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,040
which you can’t see here.

552
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,960
Girls there like
to put flowers in their hair.

553
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,890
They look much prettier
than gold hairpins.

554
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:13,530
By then,

555
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,920
I’ll get many beautiful flowers for you.

556
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,370
Smile if you agree.

557
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,040
Come on. Have some.

558
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,680
Mother, you wanted to see me?

559
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,010
Be seated.

560
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,130
You’re handling business?

561
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,160
Yes.

562
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:03,960
Now, we have all the five tokens.

563
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,490
We must strengthen our defense.

564
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,770
Or when the Demons come,

565
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:08,740
we will be hurt.

566
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,080
Don’t worry.

567
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,320
If the Demons

568
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,800
come to us,

569
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,730
I’ll kill them.

570
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:23,530
Fei.

571
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,680
Xie Yun has

572
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,650
a complicated background.

573
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,500
All kinds of connections are with him.

574
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,530
If you’re related to him,

575
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,650
and get involved,

576
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,490
I’m afraid you can never get rid of it.

577
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,200
Mother.

578
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,770
I care for Xie Yun.

579
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:47,370
Such political disputes

580
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:48,890
have nothing to do with me.

581
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,250
I also hear

582
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:57,130
the Bone-chilling on him
is getting worse.

583
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,370
You know he’s dying.

584
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:01,890
Is it still worth your time?

585
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,610
Just because he’s dying,

586
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,770
even a single second

587
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:09,250
can be precious to me.

588
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,730
I’m not afraid of the future.

589
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:14,250
I only want to seize the day.

590
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:18,280
Since I’ve decided to love him only,

591
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,850
I will not regret.

592
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,280
Have you made up your mind?

593
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,280
Don’t do stupid things on impulse.

594
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,560
I saw him

595
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,850
die in front of me.

596
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,090
For him,

597
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,960
I will do all the stupid things.

598
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:41,020
I will protect him myself.

599
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,250
Bone-chilling is the most poisonous,
so what?

600
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,940
Before he dies,

601
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:49,280
I’ll keep looking for the antidote

602
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,650
and fighting against it.

603
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,730
Fine.

604
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,370
It’s your decision.

605
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,440
Do it as long as you don’t regret.

606
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:05,490
As long as he’s Xie Yun.

607
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,960
Mother.

608
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,920
How...

609
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,250
How are you?

610
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:18,610
I’m fine. I just had a cold.

611
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,850
Well, take care.

612
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,410
I’ve got business to do.

613
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,650
You may leave.

614
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,650
Aunt.

615
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,010
Sheng.

616
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,960
What are you coming for?

617
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,440
These are visiting cards
from martial artists down the hill.

618
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,800
They knew about your birthday

619
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,920
out of nowhere

620
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,440
and wanted to celebrate it.

621
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,440
But we had rules

622
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,250
that we should seldom contact others.

623
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,370
Our disciples didn’t know what to do.

624
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,920
They wanted me to ask you.

625
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,730
Return the visiting cards to them.

626
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,770
This is our family dinner.

627
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,320
There’s no room for others.

628
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,850
Fine. I’ll go handle it.

629
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,010
Sheng.

630
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:03,960
Isn’t it the map

631
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,480
for our Fortress?

632
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,160
Yes.

633
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,530
It’s the map

634
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:12,490
for our defense and sentries.

635
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,010
Sheng.

636
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,490
We’ve suffered big problem this time.

637
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,730
We’re short of men

638
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,080
and we’re rehabilitating our place.

639
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,770
Since we have all the tokens

640
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,680
for the Color of Ocean and Heaven,

641
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,530
from today on,

642
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:32,730
I want you and Bai Neng

643
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,080
to gather our disciples

644
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,490
and strengthen the defense
for everywhere.

645
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:39,010
Aunt, it’s such a big responsibility.

646
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:40,680
Why do you suddenly leave it to me?

647
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,010
Li Sheng.

648
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,320
Can you handle it?

649
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,610
Yes, no problem.

650
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,370
People say you’re good
at making strategies.

651
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:52,680
You did a good job in Liu’s Manor.

652
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,070
You got famous in the martial world.

653
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:57,320
Aunt.

654
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,200
People flatter me.

655
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,490
Well, keep doing a good job.

656
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,680
Don’t waste your talent.

657
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,530
I see, Aunt.

658
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,800
Commander-in-chief.

659
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,920
What brings you here?

660
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,920
Last time, you left so angrily.

661
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,920
I thought you made up your mind

662
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,850
to break up with us.

663
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,830
You must be kidding, Lord Shen.

664
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:35,080
Zhou Fei and Xiao Chuan are back
to the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

665
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,730
Li Jinrong will have
her fortieth birthday soon.

666
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:41,040
Zhou Yitang will leave his battalion
to go back home.

667
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:45,800
You want me to assassinate him?

668
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,920
When Zhou Yitang is dead,

669
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,920
no one will lead the army
of the former dynasty.

670
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:54,890
They’ll no longer be a threat.

671
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,920
Xiao Chuan is dying.

672
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,160
I don’t need to kill him.

673
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,920
As long as you kill Zhou Yitang,

674
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,440
Xiao Chuan’s army will be gone.

675
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:11,770
Commander-in-chief.

676
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,320
I’m different

677
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,240
from Qiu Tianjin or Chu Tianyu.

678
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,610
They prefer to work for you

679
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,580
like a dog.

680
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,760
But I...

681
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:24,760
I never do a money-losing business.

682
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,850
Commander-in-chief, see you.

683
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,090
Lord Shen.

684
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:33,800
Everyone in this world
can be bought with something.

685
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,210
I’m afraid

686
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:43,520
you don’t like to give me what I want.

687
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,890
Lord Shen,

688
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,170
I don’t understand that.

689
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,970
It doesn’t matter.

690
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:56,480
Somebody, walk him out.

691
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,130
Don’t move when you’re poisoned
with my Twining Thread.

692
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,240
Or you’ll die sooner.

693
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,040
You’re Pathetic Clam?

694
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,890
I am.

695
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,650
For a mad girl,

696
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:38,060
he transferred the poison to himself.

697
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:41,000
He was just too stupid.

698
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,210
He abandoned
his unassailable martial art.

699
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,760
You claimed to be our enemy,
didn’t you?

700
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,690
You’re the only master alive
in the martial world.

701
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:20,080
After you die,

702
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,320
who else can destroy us?

703
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,970
Even without the North Blade,
the Mountain Sword and I,

704
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,840
there will be new masters.

705
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,040
You bully Jiuniang
when she’s still young.

706
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,720
Given some time,

707
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,720
she’ll frighten you
with peerless Yellow and Green Palm.

708
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,520
There’re always new masters.

709
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,170
It’s the way the world functions.

710
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:52,320
Talking stubbornly when you’re dying?

711
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,560
You’re just dying
for interfering with other’s business.

712
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:58,610
Who did you remove the poison
for Duan Jiuniang?

713
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,560
If you have something

714
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,650
to tell Duan Jiuniang,

715
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,650
I can pass it on to her.

716
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:08,210
Shen Tianshu.

717
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,560
You have good martial arts.

718
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,800
But you never understand
people’s hearts.

719
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,650
I have nothing to tell her.

720
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,240
I don’t need her to thank me, either.

721
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,000
I just want her to live a good life

722
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:30,560
and not meet you again.

723
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,970
Let him go.

724
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:40,280
He just has the last strength.

725
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,760
He was so stupid

726
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,480
that he took over the insoluble poison,

727
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,280
ruining his South Blade

728
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,210
and the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

729
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:05,320
We’re going to attack the Fortress.

730
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:17,760
Hope we won’t suffer
like we did last time.

731
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,670
(Fei is back, when will you come back?)

732
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,480
Father.

733
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,970
It’s been months since you left.

734
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,410
You’re finally back.

735
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,450
Pull out your blade.

736
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,040
Awesome!

737
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:44,930
From now on,

738
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,480
you’ll take care of the Fortress.

739
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,210
Elders.

740
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:55,040
You’re the witnesses.

741
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,450
-Yes.
-Don’t worry.

742
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,240
What’s wrong, Sister?

743
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:26,720
Jinfeng.

744
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,170
Father asked us
to send a secret letter to Jiankang.

745
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,450
Nothing else?

746
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,520
Father said it was a secret letter
to Mr. Zhou

747
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,520
and we must give it to him personally.

748
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,190
What, Sister...?

749
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:42,520
Weird.

750
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,000
I could have sent the letter alone.

751
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,320
When all our elite disciples go,

752
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,560
won’t we be more eye-catching?

753
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,000
Sister, you defeated Father
the other day.

754
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,240
Does he think you’re strong

755
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,080
so that he wants us to go with you

756
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,450
and fight for military exploit
in Anping Army?

757
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:03,480
Nonsense.

758
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,610
Since our Fortress was built,

759
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,280
we’ve never interfered with politics.

760
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,370
Yitang worked for the former dynasty.

761
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:12,130
He can work in the army now.

762
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,130
Father won’t let us get involved.

763
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,610
Then why did he send us?

764
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,370
Sister, what are you doing?

765
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:21,800
It’s a secret letter!

766
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,760
Jinrong.

767
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,410
I’m badly poisoned and can’t be cured.

768
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:27,560
The Demons will certainly attack us

769
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,480
with Yu Wenzhi.

770
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,410
Hope you can leave
with young disciples from the trouble.

771
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:36,720
I’ll ask Yitang
to protect you for a while.

772
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,450
After the Demons leave,

773
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:40,320
hope you can come back to our Fortress

774
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,840
and rebuild it.

775
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:44,760
(From Li Zheng)
Remember not to be impulsive.

776
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,720
Do not fight who you can’t defeat.

777
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,370
General Wang!

778
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:51,800
Our Fortress is in crisis.

779
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:53,280
General Wang!

780
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,720
My father Li Zheng has never

781
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,720
asked you for help.

782
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,520
But for righteousness,

783
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,130
he helped you a few times!

784
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:04,850
Now he’s in danger!

785
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,370
I beg you

786
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:08,210
to help us!

787
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,040
The situation is critical.

788
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,130
Many enemies cast covetous eyes on us.

789
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:26,170
It’s not that I don’t want to help him.

790
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:28,690
But I’m too weak to go.

791
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:33,480
Jinrong. Jinfeng.

792
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,160
I’m sorry.

793
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:38,690
Wang Lin!

794
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:41,930
We have helped your army!

795
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,800
But I must stick to the national cause!

796
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:55,450
Let’s go back

797
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:57,400
and fight it out with them!

798
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,720
Father!

799
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:41,650
Father!

800
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,170
Father!

801
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,560
-Father!
-Father! Father!

802
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,690
Father, are you alright?

803
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,410
Father.

804
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,610
Jinrong, keep the Bracelet carefully.

805
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:12,450
Give this silk bag

806
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:14,930
to Jiuniang.

807
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:16,890
Promise me

808
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:18,610
you won’t be hard on her.

809
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:20,800
She’s not to blame for my poisoning.

810
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,610
Father, say no more!

811
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:24,560
I’ll go get the doctor!

812
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,080
Jinrong.

813
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,040
Jinrong.

814
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,320
I’ll leave the Fortress

815
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,210
to you.

816
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:39,520
Yitang, Wang Lin didn’t send the troops.

817
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,080
You did, right?

818
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:46,210
Yes.

819
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,130
Do you remember

820
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
our rules?

821
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:59,360
Recite them to me.

822
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:05,080
Fighters like us rid
the world of evilness,

823
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,790
deliver people from misery,

824
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,240
and bring righteousness to the world.

825
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,400
We don’t seek immortal fame.

826
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:16,410
We aren’t afraid of being misunderstood.

827
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:18,970
But we must not go
against the law of heaven,

828
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:23,650
the law of earth,
nor our own conscience.

829
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:29,610
Father!

830
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:31,040
Master!

831
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,370
