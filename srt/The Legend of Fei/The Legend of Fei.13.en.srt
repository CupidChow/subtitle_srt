17
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,400
Yeah.

18
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,630
Just now,

19
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,160
I blew off the Dragon Incense,

20
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,000
and broke the Dragon Flag.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,760
It may not end well.

22
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,870
General Wen comes just in time.

23
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,210
Your Majesty.

24
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,160
Give my order,

25
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,440
to evacuate people!

26
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,630
-Aye!
-Aye!

27
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,660
(Kai)

28
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,090
Sir, what happened to you?

29
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,050
My old wounds haven’t recovered.

30
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,000
Just now, I was punched by Feng Wuyan.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,720
But I’m fine.

32
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,810
Before getting what he wants,

33
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,360
Feng Wuyan will not

34
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,910
let it go.

35
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,240
If he follows us in,

36
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,220
you must fight with him.

37
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,190
Me?

38
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,550
I’m going to teach you

39
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,960
some little Eight-trigram Formation.

40
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,600
Before he realizes,

41
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,160
we’ll break into
the Eight-trigram Formation

42
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,040
and run out.

43
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,030
This?

44
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,040
I... I saw this before.

45
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,960
Is this

46
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,880
the Eight-trigram Formation
of Daoist magic?

47
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,770
You know it?

48
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,720
I did some light readings at home.

49
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,830
I had a memory of it.

50
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,830
Great!

51
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,930
Senior brother.

52
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,510
You rushed in so hurriedly.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,620
Are you hurt?

54
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,190
Let’s go.

55
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:10,820
Go!

56
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,940
Where... Where are we going?

57
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,450
Qian, three Yang.

58
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,240
Kun, six Yin.

59
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,460
-Answer me, or I’ll break in.
-Go.

60
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,360
Sir, sir, are you alright?

61
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,630
Zhen, six Yin on the top.

62
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,310
Senior brother.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,370
Gen, six Yin on the bottom.

64
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,920
Come out and let’s talk.

65
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,960
Li, Yin in the middle.

66
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,220
Senior brother.

67
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,430
Kan, Yang in the middle.

68
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,320
Senior brother.

69
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,370
Dui, three Yin on the top.

70
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,070
Xun, three Yin on the bottom.

71
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,880
-Wrong.
-We can’t go this way.

72
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,600
Take three steps right forwards.

73
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,920
How stupid you are!

74
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,110
Go.

75
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,160
I haven’t heard of this before.

76
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,280
Give me some time to digest it.

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,160
In this Eight-trigram Formation,

78
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,440
even switchable screens
represent divinations.

79
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,440
Qian, three Yang. Kun, six Yin.

80
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,740
Didn’t you read books
about Daoist magic?

81
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,350
According to it,

82
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,320
Only Kai, Xiu and Sheng Doors

83
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,440
are available doors.

84
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,390
Unavailable doors are full of traps

85
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,650
which are not passable.

86
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,830
I think I understand.

87
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,520
According to books about Daoist magic,

88
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,350
there are eight doors.

89
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,510
When we find Sheng Door
in the northeast,

90
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,790
we can go out, huh?

91
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,230
Senior brother.

92
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,950
If you hear me, say something.

93
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,490
I didn’t expect you to be so clever.

94
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,000
Let’s go west

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,950
for Jing Door.

96
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,480
Weird. Isn’t it an unavailable door,

97
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,830
with traps?

98
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,160
You can’t give the chief’s whisk
to an outsider,

99
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,930
right?

100
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,920
How about this?

101
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,950
Give it to me.

102
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,000
And I’ll let you go, all right?

103
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,070
Feng Wuyan.

104
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,200
Because you wanted it,

105
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,600
you brought disaster to us.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,790
Now, our sect is in such trouble!

107
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,020
Do you still not regret?

108
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,920
Regret?

109
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,550
My father was partial to you.

110
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,610
You’re now partial to a young man.

111
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,020
You’re going too far!

112
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,320
I’m taking back what belongs to me!

113
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,200
Don’t walk to Jing Door.

114
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,610
Get away in time. Hurry.

115
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,350
(Jing Door)

116
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,200
You’re obsessed!

117
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,510
Feng Wuyan!

118
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,000
Former Chief gave the whisk to me.

119
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,550
I can’t let him down!

120
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,390
Don’t use my dead father as the excuse!

121
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,110
I didn’t mean to kill you.

122
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,720
Don’t force me!

123
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,260
(Jing Door)
Go.

124
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,420
(Jing Door)

125
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,860
(Sheng Door)

126
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,350
Qian, three Yang. Kun, six Yin.

127
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,550
Zhen, six Yin on the top.
Gen, six Yin on the bottom.

128
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,600
Li, Yin in the middle.
Kan, Yang in the middle.

129
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,830
Dui, three Yin on the top.
Xun, three Yin on the bottom.

130
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,230
Do you remember the formula

131
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,030
I just taught you?

132
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,200
Almost.

133
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,480
I almost remember it.

134
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:11,790
Sir?

135
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,220
Sir?

136
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,200
Sir!

137
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,270
You’re now

138
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,390
in the Big Dipper Array,

139
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,110
among eight famous arrays
of Mystery Forest.

140
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,040
Think about how to get out of it.

141
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,100
Big Dipper Array?

142
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,160
Qian, three Yang. Kun, six Yin.
Zhen, six Yin on the top.

143
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,270
Kan, Yang in the middle.
Li, Yin in the middle.

144
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,200
He’s too honest.

145
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,790
He thinks

146
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,000
he owed you!

147
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,110
But I don’t owe you!

148
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,320
Honest?

149
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,540
How dare he say that!

150
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,230
He said

151
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,270
he gave his life to me,

152
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,700
so that I could kill him as I wished.

153
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,430
But in fact,

154
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,440
you’ve been hiding
and I couldn’t even find you!

155
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,200
In my opinion,

156
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,880
you’re as hypocritical

157
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,610
as before!

158
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,800
Pei.

159
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,260
Don’t worry.

160
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,840
I don’t have martial arts now.

161
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,740
You can kill me,

162
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,690
sooner or later.

163
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,220
But if the North Blade vanishes

164
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,450
in my hand,

165
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,420
I’ll feel bad.

166
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,390
The North Blade?

167
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,250
What about the Mountain Sword
of my family?

168
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,160
You’ll feel bad?

169
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,030
My father didn’t even have a chance
to feel bad!

170
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,160
But don’t worry.

171
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,610
I will get back

172
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,870
what you owe me.

173
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,260
You can’t get away today.

174
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,440
So,

175
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,950
you led Dragon Master to this place

176
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,920
so that he would kill me?

177
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,060
(Fortress of the Forty-Eight)

178
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,420
Ms. Kou.

179
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,950
A message from the secret service.

180
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,790
Leave me.

181
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,200
Aye.

182
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,170
Madam.

183
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,350
A disciple sent a message,

184
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,260
saying there’s no news
about Ms. Wang and others.

185
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,670
I see.

186
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,880
Ms. Kou.

187
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,560
I feel something fishy.

188
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,230
Please send some capable disciples

189
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,470
to keep looking for them.

190
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,760
If there’s still no news,

191
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,880
I’ll go personally.

192
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,010
Aye.

193
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,270
Hua, I’m afraid we’d better leave.

194
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,880
(Oil)
You saved

195
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,590
my life.

196
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,330
I’ve already enjoyed it.

197
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,150
I’m not afraid of death.

198
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,150
But I don’t want to leave the inn.

199
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,840
Your Majesty.

200
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,280
Guests have been evacuated.

201
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,590
Please go back with me.

202
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,510
I’m afraid
Dragon Master is arriving soon.

203
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,600
I messed up with Dragon Master.

204
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,550
As long as there’s one last guest,

205
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,350
I can’t leave.

206
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,080
But...

207
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,560
Oh,

208
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,510
where is Zichen?

209
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,150
He’s on his way back to Jiankang.

210
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,350
Luckily,

211
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,400
you used a wise strategy

212
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,470
in Huarong.

213
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,290
Or his problem wouldn’t
have been solved.

214
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:11,820
I just met him

215
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,060
and helped him out.

216
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,200
Your Majesty, you must go back with me.

217
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,160
General Wen.

218
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,210
Pretend you didn’t see me, will you?

219
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,930
I can’t.

220
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,860
Your Majesty.

221
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,480
So many people saw you.

222
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,960
Please don’t embarrass me.

223
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,280
You’re having me surrounded

224
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,710
with so many men.

225
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:36,850
Even if I want to embarrass you,

226
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,050
can I?

227
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,040
When General Wang Lin

228
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,080
commanded the armies,

229
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,620
we were so proud.

230
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,880
Now, he has gone.

231
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,840
Our soldiers

232
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
have been expecting you

233
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,570
to come back and take charge.

234
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,350
Why don’t I remember anything

235
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,100
about this?

236
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,290
I’m sorry.

237
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,350
It’s okay.

238
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,560
Oh,

239
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,470
ask the cook downstairs

240
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,550
for two jars of beef paste.

241
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,400
If I don’t have any now,

242
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,870
I’m afraid I can’t have it anymore.

243
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,130
I can finally give this back to you.

244
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,240
Fei.

245
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,730
You’re still angry with Xie?

246
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,680
Him?

247
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,020
Besides legs,

248
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,510
he has only a rich stock of lies.

249
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,960
If he wants to talk,

250
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,380
he can keep talking for the whole day,

251
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,080
even when the pigs fly.

252
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,100
But...

253
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,870
He’s an emperor.

254
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,270
Why is he wandering about?

255
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,330
Well,

256
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,030
he’s a poor man, too.

257
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,200
His name was Xiao Chuan,

258
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,700
a prince of the former dynasty.

259
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,470
When he was little,
he suffered a rebellion.

260
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,200
-The palace was besieged.
-This way.

261
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,590
Later, there was a fire.

262
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,900
No one was expected to run out.

263
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,110
Unexpectedly, an old eunuch
risked his own life

264
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,140
to send him out of the palace.

265
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,880
General Wang Lin of the former dynasty

266
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,000
got Mr. Xie back to the palace.

267
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,710
Good days didn’t last long, though.

268
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,800
He was sent to the neighboring country
as a hostage.

269
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,790
During this period,

270
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,540
another general rebelled
and built a new dynasty.

271
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,420
The former one was then overthrown.

272
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,590
General Wang Lin supported Mr. Xie
as the Emperor,

273
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,260
trying to recover the former dynasty.

274
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,110
Is this why

275
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,150
he concealed his identity

276
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,770
and became Xie Meimei?

277
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,000
But why didn’t he tell me?

278
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,840
His kingdom was gone.

279
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,790
Here is the new dynasty.

280
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,040
Instead of living a rich life,

281
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,440
Mr. Xie wanders around alone.

282
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,910
There must be some reason.

283
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,840
It’s understandable

284
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,740
when he didn’t tell you who he was.

285
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,590
I nearly stabbed the Emperor
of the former dynasty.

286
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,110
Whatever!

287
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,490
I don’t care if he’s an emperor.

288
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,300
In my eyes,

289
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,710
he’s just the unlucky Xie Meimei

290
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,530
who always lies.

291
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,520
Oh,

292
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,080
you told me

293
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,150
when you came,

294
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,960
you received a letter of my mother’s

295
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,030
from our secret service.

296
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,430
Yes. I have it.

297
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,060
(To General Feiqing)

298
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,180
(To General Feiqing)

299
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,140
(From Li Jinrong)

300
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,440
My mother asked the secret service

301
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,410
to send you back to the Fortress.

302
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,650
She has a point.

303
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,710
A rich girl like you

304
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,130
should live in big house

305
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,280
and a lot of people should serve you

306
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,840
when you leave home.

307
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,840
You shouldn’t have been wandering around

308
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,110
with us.

309
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,440
Life in the Fortress of the Forty-Eight

310
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,960
can’t be as good as before.

311
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,110
But at least,

312
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,030
you’ll be taken care of

313
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,890
and well provided for.

314
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,280
Fei.

315
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,010
I’m no longer a rich girl.

316
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,940
(Letter)

317
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,520
Weird.

318
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,640
Why did my mother only mention you,

319
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,850
but not your younger brother?

320
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,910
Theoretically,

321
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,730
she shouldn’t have been so calm

322
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,500
after she knew
what had happened in Huarong.

323
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,880
Unless...

324
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,290
This letter is fake?

325
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,230
There’s something wrong

326
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,170
with the secret service?

327
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,720
I must go home and check.

328
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,440
No way.

329
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,340
About the problem of Dragon Master,

330
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,320
Xie Yun and I are also involved.

331
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,350
If we leave like this,

332
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,360
I’m afraid

333
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,360
everyone in the inn will be doomed.

334
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,030
Chuchu.

335
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,400
I’ll have General Wen

336
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,030
send you to my father’s place.

337
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,560
He’ll take good care of you.

338
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,360
I’m not going anywhere.

339
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,990
I just want to follow you.

340
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,180
No way.

341
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,760
If General Wen fights

342
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,080
with Dragon Master,

343
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,160
I don’t think I can take care of you.

344
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,260
It’s because I’m not strong enough.

345
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,410
If only I could be as powerful
as my grandpa!

346
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
Fei. Fei.

347
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,040
I believe no one,

348
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,980
but you.

349
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,950
Besides,

350
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,640
I’m not a thing.

351
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,300
Don’t always deliver me.

352
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,950
Fine.

353
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,070
Stay in the room, then.

354
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,920
Don’t go downstairs

355
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,730
before I tell you to.

356
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,300
(Help)

357
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,420
(Help)

358
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,280
Sorry, but I can’t help.

359
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,070
Your Majesty,
what the hell are you doing?

360
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,950
Heroine.

361
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,640
Take me with you, too.

362
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,070
You’ll take her, anyway.

363
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,310
Take me as well.

364
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,680
Besides, if there’s danger,

365
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,000
I can run away.

366
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,430
I won’t get you in trouble.

367
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,160
You heard it?

368
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,930
I did hear it.

369
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,590
You’re not angry with me anymore, huh?

370
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,680
From now on,

371
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,920
we’ll go our own ways.

372
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,190
Why should I be angry with you?

373
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,110
Heroine. Heroine.

374
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,070
I beg you.

375
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,880
Get me out of the inn!

376
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,520
I beg you.

377
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,310
I’ll do anything I can in my next life

378
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,520
to repay you.

379
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,680
Fei. Fei.

380
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,070
I wondered

381
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,040
if you really wandered about

382
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,860
to help the weak!

383
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,760
Turns out

384
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,190
you’re just the same as Li Sheng.

385
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,520
You both fool around

386
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,630
and even run away from home.

387
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,880
After handling the problem here,

388
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,310
I’m going home.

389
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,160
Listen.

390
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,540
You’d better go home early, too.

391
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,740
You have poor martial arts.

392
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,930
Don’t get your families
to worry about you.

393
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,300
I also want to go home.

394
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,250
I wish to have a family

395
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,320
to expect me back.

396
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,120
You... You don’t have a family?

397
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,670
Family?

398
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,390
Speaking of relatives,

399
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,190
I think there are many.

400
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,660
But...

401
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,280
They’re not a family at all.

402
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,250
You...

403
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
You have a younger sworn brother,

404
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,190
don’t you?

405
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,720
Zichen?

406
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,240
Yeah.

407
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,770
I watched him grow up.

408
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,110
He’s also close to me.

409
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,240
He’s the Third Prince of this dynasty.

410
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,760
We’re of different status.

411
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:25,820
But...

412
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,440
Luckily, I have him.

413
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,880
-Run!
-Go!

414
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,310
Get in.

415
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,680
Why are they beating the gong
in the day?

416
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,140
You don’t know, huh?

417
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,900
I won’t tell you.

418
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,950
(Oil)
Ji.

419
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,920
(Oil)
There’s sound of gong out there.

420
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,820
Seems like Dragon Master has arrived.

421
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,020
(Zheng Luosheng, Dragon Master
of Four-guardian Mountain)

422
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,000
(Wen)

423
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,880
(Wen)
Our general asked me

424
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,590
to take his regards to you.

425
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,560
I wonder

426
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,380
what you come for.

427
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,580
I see.

428
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,470
General Wen asked his man

429
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,640
to send a message.

430
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,430
So, Dragon Master is using

431
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,280
his way.

432
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,760
He also sent a subordinate.

433
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,210
He is putting on airs!

434
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,760
Good.

435
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,110
You guessed it right.

436
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,310
You’re getting smart.

437
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,800
My master said

438
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,230
this place didn’t belong
to north or south.

439
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,160
But when he knew you were here,

440
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,750
he wouldn’t make trouble.

441
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,400
But,

442
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,710
he has lost a dog.

443
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,400
He heard

444
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,160
his dog was locked up in this inn

445
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,920
and someone burned the Dragon Flag

446
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,230
and put out the Dragon Incense.

447
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,280
We come for an explanation.

448
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,710
General Wen is reasonable.

449
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,690
I don’t think

450
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,350
he’ll blame us.

451
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,890
Who do you think

452
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:16,800
is more powerful,

453
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,510
Dragon Master, Shen Tianshu

454
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,940
or Duan Jiuniang?

455
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,840
As famous as Mu Xiaoqiao,

456
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,640
he must have something great.

457
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,950
In such a big world,

458
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,790
there are many powerful men.

459
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,230
It can be a difficult job

460
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,500
to compare them.

461
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,000
But I believe

462
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,120
you’ll be as powerful as them.

463
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,190
Under the premise

464
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,750
that we can get out of the inn.

465
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,520
I don’t mean to be unreasonable.

466
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,680
But an important man is living here.

467
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:03,300
I think you’d better leave.

468
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,230
We’re leaving early tomorrow morning.

469
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,540
Why don’t you wait for one more night?

470
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,710
Tomorrow,

471
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,040
you can fight

472
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,270
whomever you hate.

473
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:16,020
I won’t interfere.

474
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,350
People like us don’t want

475
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,590
to be your enemies.

476
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:21,870
Fine.

477
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,120
General Wen, take it easy, too.

478
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,480
We’ll wait outside the inn.

479
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,590
After you leave tomorrow,

480
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,760
we’ll come again.

481
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,540
Leave.

482
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:40,900
Dragon Master.

483
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,280
I destroyed your flag

484
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,780
and your incense.

485
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,530
I’m your enemy.

486
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,160
Let go of guests in the inn

487
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,740
and fight me!

488
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,530
You’re doing this on purpose?

489
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,000
I don’t have a choice
under this circumstance.

490
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,440
General Wen!

491
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,060
What is your mission of your trip?

492
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,360
To protect you.

493
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:15,750
Yeah.

494
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,110
You’re right.

495
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,850
We’ll have chances
to see such occasions.

496
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,330
Now, we should run away.

497
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,320
But the whole inn is besieged.

498
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:27,830
Do you remember

499
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,520
when the young man came this morning,

500
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,430
Mr. Hua asked him to search,

501
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,560
but he found nothing?

502
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,000
So,

503
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,440
you mean

504
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,410
there’s a secret tunnel in the inn?

505
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,730
What, General Wen?

506
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,880
Could this arrogant young man

507
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,270
be your master?

508
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,440
I came for several times,

509
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,060
but you avoided me.

510
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,440
When I tried to fight that girl,

511
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,300
you showed up in time!

512
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,350
I’m sure

513
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,430
you’ve got a hiding place here.

514
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,470
Run away from your doghole, then!

515
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,680
Since you’re awesome,

516
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,070
you’ll make great achievements!

517
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,280
Why are you staying here?

518
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,040
Just leave!

519
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,920
Don’t, Miss Zhou.

520
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,760
If you push him out,

521
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,030
you’ll get him killed.

522
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,040
He nearly got you killed!

523
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,350
He made so much trouble!

524
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,390
Why are you still defending him?

525
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,350
I’m sorry.

526
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,130
I don’t want to get involved.

527
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,760
Mr. Ji,

528
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,700
where is the doghole

529
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:38,960
you just

530
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,400
mentioned?

531
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,420
What?

532
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:56,990
You want to get in?

533
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,040
Not before you kill me.

534
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,400
If you promise not to hurt him,

535
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,430
I’ll take you there.

536
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,860
Chuchu is still upstairs.

537
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,400
I’ll go get prepared.

538
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
I’ll see you in the granary

539
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,280
in fifteen minutes.

540
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,200
-Okay.
-Okay.

541
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,880
If we really fight,

542
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,740
General Wen,

543
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,010
it’s hard to see who will win.

544
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,220
You’re right, Dragon Master.

545
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,400
If you can

546
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:50,090
let go of local people

547
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,880
for the sake of my young master,

548
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,120
I will visit you

549
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,590
and thank you

550
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,470
with generous gifts.

551
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,780
Fine.

552
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:02,050
I’ll let them go, for your sake.

553
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,590
I’ll forget about
the incense and flag thing.

554
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,590
And I won’t kill local people.

555
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,280
But...

556
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,850
My dog is clever.

557
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,940
If I can’t get it back,

558
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,800
I’m afraid...

559
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,800
I don’t want it to happen again.

560
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,140
So today,

561
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,090
I must get in and search.

562
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,570
This has nothing to do
with your young master.

563
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,420
General Wen,

564
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,420
you will help, won’t you?

565
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,340
Dragon Master.

566
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,350
Please.

567
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:12,800
Search it!

568
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,070
-Aye.
-Aye.

569
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,230
You...

570
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,250
You won’t fight?

571
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,400
Young Master, this is the end.

572
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,580
Don’t embarrass me anymore.

573
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,650
Wait!

574
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,760
These two girls are families

575
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,680
of our young master.

576
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,920
They two

577
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,440
look gorgeous.

578
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,860
You just promised to let people go
for my sake.

579
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,310
What?

580
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,050
You regret?

581
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,180
I thought about it again.

582
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,770
I think

583
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,190
we’d better fight.

584
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,260
(Cloud)

585
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,520
The secret tunnel is near the granary.

586
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,240
Go.

587
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,640
You’re brave.

588
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,400
When Mr. Zhou knows,

589
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,430
he’ll be relieved.

590
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,070
Fei.

591
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,830
Don’t show off your bravery.

592
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,760
Go find Mr. Ji.

593
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,520
I’ll go with my beautiful girl.

594
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,540
Is beating an emperor against the law?

595
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,910
You shouldn’t beat anyone.

596
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,740
Beating ordinary people is
also against the law.

597
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,780
Good, then.

598
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,070
Don’t go too far!

599
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,470
Are you really an emperor?

600
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,940
Do they get the wrong guy?

601
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:23,820
Wait.

602
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,800
General Wen looks reliable.

603
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,740
I don’t think he gets the wrong guy.

604
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:32,860
So,

605
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,220
you get the wrong identity, huh?

606
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,760
Exactly.

607
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,180
You know me best.

608
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,140
You’ve seen me through.

609
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,240
I get to like you more.

610
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,040
If today,

611
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,640
General Wen gets hurt for you,

612
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,950
you’ll lose a lot.

613
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,680
Don’t worry.

614
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,680
General Wen is the strongest subordinate
of your father.

615
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,310
Dragon Master can’t hurt him.

616
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,450
Go.

617
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,680
Let’s go to the granary for Mr. Ji.

618
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,650
Where’s Chuchu?

619
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,280
Stop looking. Here she is.

620
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,160
Fei.

621
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,880
I don’t have great martial arts,

622
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,280
compared to great people

623
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,710
like you.

624
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,800
But I think

625
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,830
it won’t be a problem

626
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,330
when I want to kill such a girl.

627
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,230
That’s all you can do?

628
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,780
Take your hands off her!

629
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,000
If she’s hurt even a little bit,

630
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,890
I won’t let you go!

631
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,430
Why does she look

632
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,950
much more beautiful than you?

633
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,560
Girls should be as gentle

634
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,610
as her.

635
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:10,360
But you keep fighting.

636
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,040
You’ll get wrinkles on your face.

637
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,150
Oh, I forgot.

638
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,670
When you keep fighting,

639
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,990
you won’t even be old enough
to have wrinkles.

640
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,830
Besides,

641
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,870
do I look like I’m afraid of death?

642
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:23,750
Pei!

643
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,320
I heard Mr. Ji called you like that.

644
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,220
I guess that’s your name, huh?

645
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:37,690
Are you Mr. Yin?

646
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,150
What do you know?

647
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,470
Miss Zhou.

648
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:54,460
Don’t kill him.

649
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,080
I didn’t expect him to learn

650
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,100
the acupoint-shifting way
from Dragon Master.

651
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,180
I’m sorry for my neglection.

652
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:03,800
Do you think

653
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,020
I only joined Four-guardian Mountain
for shelter?

654
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,960
No wonder you were so evasive.

655
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,440
Turns out you were just lying,

656
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,710
so that you could kill people
and run away!

657
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:16,230
Miss Zhou, let him go.

658
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:16,770
For the...

659
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,440
For the sake of Old Master Li.

660
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,250
Why do you mention my grandpa?

661
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:26,450
Fei.

662
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,500
If I guess correctly,

663
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,040
he’s the offspring of Yin Wenlan.

664
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,700
The Mountain Sword?

665
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,240
One of the most famous marital artists?

666
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,230
Sword stands for gentlemen.

667
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,600
The Mountain Sword Yin Wenlan

668
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,800
came from a decent sect.

669
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,300
He became a master after he grew up.

670
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,590
Sadly,
he and his family were all killed.

671
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,470
He? Offspring of the Mountain Sword?

672
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,430
What are you staring at?

673
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,470
If you were really proud,

674
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,660
why did you do dirty things before?

675
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,800
We’d better leave soon.

676
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,650
Let’s go.

677
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:05,140
(Wine)

678
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,230
(Welcome Guests)

679
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,230
Master.

680
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,150
We’ve searched two floors of the inn,

681
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,430
but didn’t find him.

682
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,150
Losers!

683
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,100
(Animal on screen is an example of CG)

684
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,780
(Animal on screen is an example of CG)
Go.

685
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,700
(Animal on screen is an example of CG)

686
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,760
(Animal on screen is an example of CG)
Go find him out.

687
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,580
(Animal on screen is an example of CG)

688
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,320
The North Blade stays

689
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,320
in such a small inn

690
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,190
as a cook.

691
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,710
He’s so scared

692
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,360
that he has even dug a secret tunnel.

693
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,120
I don’t understand.

694
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,840
Why are you a rat instead of human?

695
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,560
What about you?

696
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,320
You’d like to be a dog, too.

697
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,730
You know nothing!

698
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,710
I’m a human.

699
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,620
I don’t understand you, without doubt.

700
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,800
I’m kind enough to let you follow us.

701
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,150
What are you yelling for?

702
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,670
I’ll beat you!

703
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,870
Everybody, I dug

704
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,150
this secret tunnel

705
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:21,560
for my fiancée and me.

706
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,800
We wanted to live in seclusion

707
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,390
and hide here.

708
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,470
In case enemies come to fight us,

709
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:29,760
we dug this secret tunnel.

710
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,470
It has nothing to do with Ji.

711
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,950
Miss Zhou.

712
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:35,870
Mr. Xie.

713
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:36,430
Miss Wu.

714
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:39,670
Please go first. Hurry.

715
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,520
You go, first.

716
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,190
Okay.

717
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:43,910
Mr. Hua.

718
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:46,020
Is your hand okay?

719
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,410
Yes.

720
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,800
Thank you, then. We’ll go first.

721
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,390
Please.

722
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,380
Fei, go.

723
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,800
Pei, go with us.

724
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:03,960
Go.

725
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:11,860
(Animal on screen is an example of CG)

726
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,360
(Animal on screen is an example of CG)
Seems they went this way.

727
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,660
(Animal on screen is an example of CG)
After them!

728
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,380
(Animal on screen is an example of CG)

729
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,040
Pei. Pei.

730
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,190
Mr. Hua.

731
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,390
Ji, I trusted you

732
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,160
that he was just young and impulsive.

733
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,140
But you saw what he did today.

734
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,440
Why do you still defend him?

735
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,450
You saved me.

736
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,590
But I won’t let him go!

737
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,630
Hua.

738
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:45,870
You always say

739
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:48,710
he saved your life.

740
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,600
You just helped a woman
when you were young.

741
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,320
You were badly wounded and nearly died.

742
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,490
He saved you, huh?

743
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,740
Ji Yunchen.

744
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,630
The woman he saved

745
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,060
found you, huh?

746
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,230
Yes.

747
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:08,190
Why did you give her

748
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,760
the last Reviving Pill

749
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,960
to save him?

750
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,600
When I came inside the pass,

751
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,240
my master gave me a Reviving Pill.

752
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,010
It helps ordinary men

753
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,950
to get recovered from old wounds.

754
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:22,360
You had been sick since you were born.

755
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,950
I wanted to feed you with it

756
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,560
when you grew up.

757
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,770
It may help to refresh your body.

758
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,140
Unexpectedly,

759
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,630
the secret was exposed.

760
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:36,530
I knew what you had done.

761
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,740
How would I take your pill?

762
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,280
Yes.

763
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,600
I exposed that when I was drunk.

764
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,720
Ji Yunchen.

765
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,660
Why don’t you think about it?

766
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,910
Who got you drunk?

767
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,950
Who asked you for the secret?

768
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,840
Who got me there?

769
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,800
Shut up!

770
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,230
That woman seemed to be pure.

771
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,190
But she was scheming.

772
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,040
She did everything,

773
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,840
to set a trap.

774
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,470
She wanted me to hate you,

775
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,470
just to get the Reviving Pill

776
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,390
and save this man.

777
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,150
You’re alive,

778
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,430
partly because of me.

779
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,630
But you want to kill me?

780
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,910
Two ways?

781
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:31,650
Where are they?

782
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,360
They have their own grudges.

783
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,560
We’d better not interfere.

784
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,760
Hua, go!

785
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,470
Ji, you saved my life.

786
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:55,320
Since you want to defend him,

787
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,870
I’ll let you be.

788
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:00,860
Take care.

789
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,150
Hua!

790
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,230
When I dug the secret tunnel,

791
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,230
Hua!

792
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:18,120
-You!
-I set a trap.

793
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,870
I didn’t know I could use it today!

794
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,950
Why are you following up?

795
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,950
What? You built the tunnel?

796
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:56,710
Shame on you!

797
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:57,380
You!

798
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,080
Miss Zhou.

799
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,660
Where’s Mr. Hua?

800
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,760
Master.

801
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,040
General Wen’s men are still around.

802
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:45,220
(Animal on screen is an example of CG)

803
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,470
(Animal on screen is an example of CG)
My baby.

804
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,230
(Animal on screen is an example of CG)
After General Wen leaves,

805
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:49,870
(Animal on screen is an example of CG)
you must help me

806
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:52,520
(Animal on screen is an example of CG)
to find my dog.

807
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:57,900
(Animal on screen is an example of CG)

808
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,600
He is familiar with this place.

809
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,150
I guess he has run away.

810
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,360
Where is this way leading?

811
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:09,320
This way leads

812
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,390
to the foot of Mount Heng.

813
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:14,390
A secret tunnel
at the foot of Mount Heng?

814
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:15,800
Does Mount Heng Sect agree?

815
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,360
Miss Zhou, you have no idea.

816
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,390
When two armies fought in this place,

817
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:21,430
local people were suffering greatly.

818
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:23,760
Mount Heng Sect was always respected.

819
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,950
Many disciples came from local families.

820
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:27,840
They would certainly try to help.

821
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,870
But once they helped,

822
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:32,150
they would be involved in the war.

823
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,420
What happened later?

824
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:35,770
In that battle,

825
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:38,710
the chief and some elders

826
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:39,580
all died.

827
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,000
The remaining young disciples

828
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,780
couldn’t afford to hold such a big sect.

829
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:47,760
Those who had families went back home.

830
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,110
Those who didn’t have families
left with their new chief.

831
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,330
Where have they gone?

832
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:54,950
I hear the new chief was

833
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:56,870
the last disciple of the old chief.

834
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:57,910
When he left,

835
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:59,470
he was just sixteen
or seventeen years old.

836
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,090
No one knows where they left for.

837
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:05,170
We’d better leave now.

838
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,430
Go.

839
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:12,000
Fei, why does he know everything?

840
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,600
I guess he only cares about gossips

841
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,220
when he wanders around.

842
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,920
Hit your nose?

843
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,910
Your tears are running?

844
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:31,840
-Let me have a look.
-Fei.

845
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,710
Are you having a nosebleed?

846
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:33,520
Are you alright?

847
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,560
I’m fine.

848
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:36,710
What are you doing?

849
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:39,520
Believe it or not? There’s a bug.

850
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:42,040
Make way. Make way.

851
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:42,820
Disgusting.

852
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:47,130
You stepped on my foot!

853
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,130
Sir.

854
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:55,600
How much time did I use?

855
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,150
Less than fifteen minutes.

856
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:01,390
Much faster than last time.

857
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:07,630
The formation of your school
is wonderful.

858
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:10,080
The more I think about it,
the more interesting I feel.

859
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:12,840
It took me a long time

860
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,180
to understand it.

861
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:17,610
You’re a clever man.

862
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,280
You’ve learnt all our formations

863
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,520
when you learn for the first time.

864
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,200
It proves I have a good taste.

865
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,530
You’re a young talent
from the Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

866
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:32,320
I can’t take you as my disciple.

867
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,950
But I want our formations

868
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:38,700
and martial art books to be inherited

869
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,620
instead of vanishing with me.

870
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:46,120
What have I done

871
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,150
to deserve your gracious kindness?
