Wish to wear clothes made of them.

19
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,360
My mother told me,

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,200
the people live in the muddy water

21
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,310
and can’t escape from the sufferings.

22
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,260
There is no such days.

23
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,440
They have to resort to

24
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,800
a few tunes.

25
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,720
Anyone who endangers the people,

26
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,140
I’ll kill them.

27
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,230
Fei.

28
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,480
If you kill them all,

29
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,760
you will become

30
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,310
extremely irritable

31
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,470
over time.

32
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,000
That way, you’ll do what they want,

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,960
and you’ll be one of them.

34
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,250
Don’t worry.

35
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,940
I won’t be like that.

00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,900
Where is His Highness?

38
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,630
I think we should forget it.

39
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,800
The city’s crawling with demons.

40
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,270
It’s too dangerous for you to go there.

41
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,960
What if you...?

42
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,240
It’s okay.

43
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,600
Well.

44
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,630
I don’t have any other skills,

45
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,270
but I can run for my life.

46
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,030
Don’t worry.

47
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,960
But...

48
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,340
My friends are still alive or dead.

49
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,550
I have to go out to see.

50
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,090
Mr. Bai, what’s going on out there?

51
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,760
I’ve checked.

52
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,910
No one’s watching us.

53
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,110
Okay, you go out with me.

54
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:18,610
Okay.

55
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,800
It’s okay.

56
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,140
Mr. Bai will be with me.

57
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:25,520
Mr. Bai.

58
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,520
Please protect him.

59
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,920
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

60
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,190
By the way,

61
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:38,910
you stay here.

62
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,000
Don’t go anywhere.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,720
I want to ask you something
when I’m back.

64
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,310
Got it.

65
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,910
What happened?

66
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,520
How did this happen?

67
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,000
The array is ready.

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,440
I believe you’ll come out.

69
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,670
Although there were escapees,

70
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,230
it was still worthwhile.

71
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,550
Lord.

72
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,230
Please show

73
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,920
our power as the Demons.

74
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,100
Okay.

75
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,230
Listen.

76
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,640
This gang of thieves has been

77
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,880
making chaos for a long time.

78
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,200
They have never let bystanders

79
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,640
off the hook.

80
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,920
They have always robbed money,

81
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,760
horses

82
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,110
and people’s lives.

83
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,220
Fortunately, they have been caught,

84
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,070
but there are still escapees.

85
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,540
Anyone who makes an informed report

86
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,160
will be given credit

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,660
and a generous reward.

88
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,950
So much money, so much money.

89
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,270
So much food.

90
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,670
Oh, really.

91
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,760
I’ve been hungry for several days.

92
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,830
That’s all precious food.

93
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,160
-Too much.
-Ah, too much.

94
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,040
Mr. Bai.

95
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,880
The rumors you’ve heard are true.

96
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,920
What do you mean?

97
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,790
You see.

98
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,760
Shen Tianshu and Qiu Tianjin didn’t

99
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,940
communicate on the stage.

100
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,640
Something must have happened

101
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,340
between them.

102
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,910
Guys.

103
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,300
After committing such a serious crime,

104
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,980
shouldn’t he go through a thousand cuts?

105
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,710
One of the gang

106
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,950
survived the fire

107
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,600
yesterday.

108
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,360
You say.

109
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,580
What should we do with him?

110
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,440
-Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!
-Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

111
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,920
Fei.

112
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,510
How can you stand it if you’re here?

113
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,650
The Demons are drawing you out.

114
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,070
It’s impressive that

115
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,070
an evil man didn’t be burnt to death

116
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,950
in such a big fire in this guesthouse.

117
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,440
Yeah.

118
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,250
I heard it from the cellmate.

119
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,230
The evil man

120
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,560
is about to be executed in public.

121
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,790
A public execution?

122
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,350
Yeah.

123
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,160
Oh, my God.

124
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,200
Then he’ll die.

125
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,900
Yeah.

126
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
You’re here all the time,

127
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
so you don’t know.

128
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,390
Your cake is so cold and hard.

129
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:25,920
No one wants to eat it.

130
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,550
Maybe someone’s still alive.

131
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,270
I’d like to go out to see.

132
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,000
Fei.

133
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,480
Let me go with you.

134
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,790
No.

135
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,760
Chuchu, you can’t go.

136
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,310
If anything happens to you,

137
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,120
who will take care
of your little brother?

138
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,390
Stay here

139
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,440
and wait for me.

140
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,600
But

141
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,040
if anything happens to you,

142
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,120
I’ll die.

143
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,130
I’ll be back after saving them.

144
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,870
Then we’ll go back
to Fortress of the Forty-Eight.

145
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,530
Okay.

146
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,310
Thanks.

147
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,360
Don’t go anywhere,

148
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,520
or the big black wolf will bite you.

149
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,710
Thank you for taking me in.

150
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,960
Thank you.

151
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,500
I’ll repay you if I'm still alive.

152
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,780
Ma’am.

153
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,330
I’m sorry.

154
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,230
Let me ask you something.

155
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,100
You can play Snow-breaking Blade?

156
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,470
Little girl.

157
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,720
Who taught you that?

158
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,220
Family heirloom.

159
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,090
Family heirloom?

160
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,280
What’s your relationship with Li Zheng?

161
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,160
He’s my grandfather.

162
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,670
Ma’am,

163
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:21,950
Ma’am,

164
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,110
we mean no harm.

165
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,310
Please don’t hurt Fei.

166
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,880
Who exactly are you?

167
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,910
If Li Zheng is your grandfather,

168
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,200
that... That makes me

169
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,730
your grandmother.

170
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,790
Watch your mouth,

171
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,030
or I’ll battle you

172
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,480
regardless of the result.

173
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,920
Why don’t you believe me?

174
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,720
You tell me.

175
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,910
My grandmother passed away

176
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,900
when giving birth to her second son.

177
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,440
Obviously, you’re lying!

178
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,640
You could say
whatever you want about me,

179
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,280
but not my family!

180
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,150
You’re loud.

181
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,200
Step-grandmother

182
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,520
also counts.

183
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,090
She must’ve lost her mind.

184
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,020
Sweetie,

185
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,570
I like you.

186
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,230
I didn’t do anything!

187
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,350
Fei! Fei!

188
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,200
She...

189
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,030
I didn’t do anything.

190
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,880
Can you hear me, Fei?

191
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,400
I didn’t do anything.

192
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,960
Miss, Miss.

193
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,440
Get her in the room.

194
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:37,750
Come.

195
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,080
Kill him!

196
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,640
Kill him! Kill him!

197
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,110
Chenfei is still alive!

198
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,230
Calm down.

199
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,220
Don’t act rashly.

200
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,470
-He must die!
-Kill him!

201
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,840
It’s him!

202
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,770
You traitor!

203
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,670
Fortress of the Forty-Eight

204
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,790
will make you pay!

205
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,390
Mr. Zhang,

206
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,580
hang in there.

207
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,800
Don’t let the lords down.

208
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,150
Kill me now!

209
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,530
Do it, bastard!

210
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,400
His accomplices are still out there.

211
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,520
Those who capture them

212
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,960
will be rewarded handsomely.

213
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,760
His accomplices are still out there.

214
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,520
Those who capture them

215
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,960
will be rewarded handsomely.

216
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,230
Mr. Xie.

217
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,520
Mr. Bai,

218
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,440
an innocent man’s life is on the line.

219
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,920
Are you going to do nothing?

220
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,710
He’s dying

221
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,480
whether we save him or not.

222
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,230
-Is he dead?
-Yes.

223
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,230
-How did he die?
-What happened?

224
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,440
Is he dead?

225
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,240
Mr. Xie,

226
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,400
I did

227
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,140
what I had to.

228
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,190
Demons are vicious and merciless.

229
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,840
They were holding a dying man hostage

230
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,200
-only to...
-Mr. Bai,

231
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,350
Huo’s Manor started as one of the sects.

232
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,590
Members they took in
from other small sects

233
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,880
are only a bunch of bandits.

234
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,100
Why have the Huos started

235
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,200
to build up their own force, buy horses

236
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,330
and rake up money all of a sudden?

237
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,400
Mr. Xie.

238
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,040
Whose boat does
Huo Liantao think he’s on?

239
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,400
Although His Highness

240
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,230
is new to this place,

241
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,840
he’s contacted Master Huo

242
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,790
only to

243
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,280
side with martial artists

244
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,080
to battle

245
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,840
Yu Wenzhi together.

246
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,360
Besides,

247
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,030
that sect houses all kinds of people.

248
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,030
His Highness

249
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,470
has no idea about

250
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,400
who they are

251
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,590
or what they’ve done.

252
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,120
You can stop there.

253
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,090
Everyone has a few bad friends.

254
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,370
But you should know

255
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,390
who that man

256
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,370
died for.

257
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,550
Does some promise weigh
more than your life?

258
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,030
Yes!

259
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,670
What are you doing here?

260
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,320
If I didn’t kick you,

261
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,440
your leg would have been severed

262
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,710
from your body.

263
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,280
As long as

264
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,400
she could breathe,

265
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,150
she’d save others no matter what.

266
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,520
Leave me alone.

267
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,710
Get up there.

268
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,840
Too late.

269
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,840
Seriously,

270
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,640
do you know what’s happening?

271
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,110
Demons and Phoenix are all here.

272
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,520
Do you want to die?

273
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,910
I can’t abandon Li Sheng

274
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,280
and Chenfei.

275
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,590
If I leave

276
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,470
without them...

277
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,000
But she didn’t show up.

278
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,730
Did she...?

279
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,880
Mr. Xie,

280
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,900
where are you going?

281
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,270
Nothing.

282
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,560
Let’s go.

283
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,490
Once everything blows over,

284
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,090
and the coast is clear,

285
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,770
I’ll have men

286
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,360
bury your friends properly.

287
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,280
I hope

288
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,430
their bodies will still be intact

289
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,140
by then.

290
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,760
In this chaotic world, lives

291
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,640
are cheaper than grains,

292
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,830
fabrics, carriages and horses,

293
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,420
but not friendships.

294
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,310
What a tragedy!

295
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,400
Mr. Xie. Mr. Xie.

296
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,240
Are you alright?

297
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,160
Mr. Xie,

298
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,420
we should go back.

299
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,850
Her skills

300
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,200
aren’t too bad

301
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,360
and her look is slightly better.

302
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,760
But she doesn’t look like Li Zheng

303
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,120
or me.

304
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,880
Does she

305
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,000
look more like her other grandmother?

306
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,280
Ma’am, Ma’am.

307
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:17,850
Ma’am,

308
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,530
she probably resembles her father.

309
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,870
That makes sense.

310
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,080
I’ve never seen him.

311
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,160
Perhaps you can

312
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,740
introduce him to me some other day.

313
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,480
Ma’am,

314
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,600
may I know your name?

315
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,230
Call me Duan Jiuniang.

316
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,760
Who are you?

317
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,550
Where are your parents?

318
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,740
My name is Wu Chuchu.

319
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,200
My parents...

320
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,510
They died?

321
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,190
Well, that happens.

322
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,230
Look at me.

323
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,780
I have no family.

324
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,590
And my lover

325
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,480
always acts against me.

326
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,230
You must’ve got your temper

327
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,780
from your grandfather.

328
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,650
Am I right?

329
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,420
Answer me.

330
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,090
Why are you so quiet?

331
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,360
Say something!

332
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,000
Say it!

333
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,400
What happened?

334
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,400
Are you having a relapse?

335
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,110
Let Mr. Bai check you

336
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,140
in case you...

337
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,020
Mr. Bai.

338
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,940
Mr. Bai, what are you doing?

339
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,080
Zichen, help him up.

340
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,520
Get up, Mr. Bai.

341
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,670
I made a mistake.

342
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,350
Please punish me.

343
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,260
What do you mean?

344
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,830
Demons dragged Mr. Xie’s friend out

345
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:40,110
from the fire,

346
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,680
tortured him in cold blood

347
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,470
in public

348
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,670
and twisted the facts.

349
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,070
They disguised as civilians

350
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,220
and had no mercy on him.

351
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,470
I couldn’t see him

352
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,740
being tortured to death,

353
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:52,980
so I...

354
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,000
I ended his life.

355
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,200
Mr. Bai, you...

356
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,770
You killed his friend?

357
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,260
I...

358
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:09,890
Xie Yun...

359
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,740
Zichen,

360
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,290
calm down.

361
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:23,660
Mr. Bai,

362
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:25,470
please get up.

363
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,680
Come to think of it,

364
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,440
were there the one I was looking for,

365
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,160
Mr. Bai was sending a message,

366
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,600
telling her not to walk into the trap.

367
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,540
On top of that,

368
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,780
Chenfei was in excruciating pain.

369
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,780
He was hoping for a quick death.

370
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,450
I didn’t have the heart to do it,

371
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,380
and Mr. Bai actually did him a favor.

372
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,200
I owe you

373
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,940
and your friend my life.

374
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,680
Whatever you need me
to do in the future,

375
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,440
I’ll do it at all costs.

376
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,020
Never mind.

377
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,280
Zichen,

378
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,270
is there any liquor?

379
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:34,610
Liquor?

380
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,040
Chenfei,

381
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,780
I swear I’ll find Fei.

382
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,760
I’m Xie,

383
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,680
named Meimei,

384
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,160
also known as the Optimistic Man.

385
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,060
You are...

386
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,390
Xie Meimei?

387
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,390
Weed Spirit?

388
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,410
You’re awake,

389
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:51,920
Fei!

390
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,810
I think I heard Xie Yun calling me.

391
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,430
I know you’re worried about him.

392
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,590
Just relax.

393
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,310
I saw him leaving first that day.

394
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,100
That’s a relief.

395
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,000
-Xie Yun.
-Mr. Xie.

396
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,230
There you are!

397
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,990
You were out all night.
Haven’t you found anything?

398
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:58,520
Fei,

399
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,020
are you still alive?

400
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,260
Head means you’re safe

401
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,520
and tail...

402
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,100
-Open up!
-Open it!

403
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,090
Lord,

404
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,130
Blessed Dog’s men have withdrawn.

405
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,190
Found anything?

406
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:39,950
No.

407
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,470
(Stable as Mount Tai)

408
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,190
Qiu Tianjin bit more than he could chew.

409
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,160
And look what happened.

410
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,830
No one is left.

411
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,310
The gate is closed

412
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,070
and under close watch

413
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,280
by the local government.

414
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,230
Given that they managed to escape

415
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,680
and lie low for so long,

416
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,230
they must be something.

417
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,080
(Stable as Mount Tai)
Ignore others.

418
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,210
(Stable as Mount Tai)

419
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,200
(Stable as Mount Tai)
Just focus on our own search.

420
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,880
Don’t forget

421
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,680
what we’re here for.

422
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,350
Yes.

423
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,350
-Negative.
-Let’s go.

424
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,520
Search the next one.

425
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,040
What’s happening?

426
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,160
Lord has ordered us

427
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,400
to focus on our own search.

428
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,400
Jiachen, what’s the status?

429
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,830
Timber Wolf’s men
are doing their search.

430
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,000
Tell us the details.

431
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,190
Timber Wolf and Blessed Dog

432
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,310
are checking all places

433
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,470
separately

434
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,640
whether they’ve been searched

435
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,070
by the other group or not.

436
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,400
They aren’t exactly friends.

437
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,490
But their focus is different.

438
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:02,990
What do you mean?

439
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,800
Blessed Dog focuses more
on women and children,

440
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,640
especially boys, not girls.

441
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,920
That means they’re looking for

442
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,110
Miss Wu

443
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,330
or Mr. Wu.

444
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,070
What about Timber Wolf’s men?

445
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,000
They match people with sketches

446
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,700
and check the names on the registration.

447
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:22,850
They pay more attention to men.

448
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:24,950
I knew it.

449
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,060
What?

450
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,110
You know what I mean.

451
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,070
Shen Tianshu isn’t
looking for Wu Chuchu,

452
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:31,810
but you.

453
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,110
How long will they be here?

454
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,280
About ten minutes.

455
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,750
They’re only a block away.

456
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,200
Well,

457
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,860
we’ve settled down here for a while

458
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,640
and have registered our aliases.

459
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,640
Don’t worry.

460
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,920
We’ll make sure of your safety.

461
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,050
Who should we play?

462
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,830
Father and two sons.

463
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,400
Zichen,

464
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,110
hide yourself. I’ll be here.

465
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,880
Xie Yun...

466
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,070
If your father finds out about this,

467
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,050
he’ll be furious.

468
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,320
It won’t be a problem for me.

469
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,590
But...

470
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:17,310
Your Highness, Mr. Xie is right.

471
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,220
You shouldn’t be here.

472
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,470
You’re well-prepared!

473
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,950
Xie Yun, I can explain.

474
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,190
Enough.

475
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,150
That can wait after the search.

476
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,220
Your Highness, please.

477
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,450
Have some food, girls.

478
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,480
I’ve reheated

479
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,070
the porridge on the stove.

480
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,070
It’s warm enough to eat.

481
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,250
Thank you, Mrs. Song.

482
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,110
Miss Li.

483
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,090
I’m not a Li.

484
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,830
I know. My bad.

485
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,260
You know,

486
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,740
Ms. Duan

487
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,680
has been muddleheaded for over a decade.

488
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,470
She doesn’t know

489
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,650
what she says or does.

490
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,920
Please

491
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,620
don’t mind her.

492
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,520
With all due respect,

493
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,470
she seems fine to me.

494
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:42,760
Well, she isn’t totally insane.

495
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,710
Some days are better than others.

496
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,650
Sometimes, she seems fine

497
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,520
but things she suddenly recalls

498
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,760
may set her off.

499
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,420
Has Jiuniang always been like this?

500
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,470
Jiuniang?

501
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,430
She said she’s Duan Jiuniang.

502
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,730
Duan Jiuniang?

503
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,590
Over the past two decades,

504
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:04,920
the top masters are

505
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,230
the South and North Blades,
the Swordsman,

506
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:11,310
Guanxi Yellow and Green Palm
and Penglai Immortal.

507
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,470
Speaking of which,

508
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,880
I’ve met with Yellow and Green Palm,
Duan Jiuniang

509
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,680
a few times.

510
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,740
Sadly,

511
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,920
she’s been missing for over a decade.

512
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,020
No way.

513
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,470
Would the legendary Duan Jiuniang

514
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,070
degrade herself

515
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,080
to a local official’s concubine,

516
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,760
not to mention
a crazy and unfavorable one?

517
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,520
Calling her

518
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,470
Empress Dowager
would be more convincing.

519
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,280
How do you know

520
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,870
I’m not?

521
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,700
Nice blade.

522
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,940
Too bad, it’s broken.

523
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:57,640
Is she really the one?

524
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,450
Finish your meal before going out.

525
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,700
It’s dangerous outside.

526
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,550
Watch out for the big bad wolf!

527
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,590
Let’s go.

528
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,470
Sorry for the trouble.

529
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,230
I apologize.

530
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,390
Good day. Take care.

531
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,190
Search it.

532
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,260
-Officer.
-Come here.

533
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:06,990
Who are you?

534
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,110
Officer,

535
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:13,070
I’m Liu San, 50 years old,

536
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,680
a widower.

537
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,350
I have two sons.

538
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,040
We’re all farmers.

539
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,760
The eldest one is Liu Shi,

540
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,280
and the younger one is Liu Shan.

541
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,520
Would you like some water?

542
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,560
Let me get you some.

543
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,640
Go away.

544
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,110
Save it.

545
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,460
Or I’ll get suspicious.

546
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,620
Those three are clean.

547
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,320
Let’s go to the next one.

548
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,060
Take care, Officer. Have a nice day.

549
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,470
Who is it?

550
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,230
Shi, Shi!

551
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,450
I’m so sorry. I...

552
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,330
I’m fine, Father.

553
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,710
Why do farmers like you

554
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,320
need a desk?

555
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,760
Who

556
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,150
is it for?

557
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,670
Officer,

558
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,670
I used to be a teacher

559
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:04,190
and moved here to make a living.

560
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,630
Shi!

561
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,430
-Shi! Shi!
-Shi!

562
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,630
-Are you alright?
-Shi!

563
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,360
How do you feel, Shi?

564
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,190
Officer, my son has the white plague.

565
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,560
It’s almost incurable.

566
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,670
The white plague?

567
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,670
How did he get it?

568
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,520
Refugees flooded into Huarong

569
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,870
a while ago and broke the peace here.

570
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,630
Many of them suffered from that disease

571
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,750
and they must’ve infected my son.

572
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:13,910
I... I...

573
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:16,390
Please let him get treated first.

574
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,000
Gross!

575
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,520
Officer.

576
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,360
Let’s go!

577
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,800
Officer.

578
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,760
We’re losing him!

579
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,120
Shan,

580
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,280
go get the physician!

581
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,430
I’m on it!

582
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,390
Mr. Xie.

583
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,430
-Water.
-Yes.

584
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,030
Water.

585
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,180
Your Highness, sorry about it.

586
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,710
Mr. Xie, I’m sorry for what happened.

587
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,760
No need.

588
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,800
Water.

589
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,080
Yes.

590
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,020
I’m sorry, Xie Yun.

591
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,000
Don’t be.

592
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:05,970
It’s over.

593
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,100
Your Highness.

594
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:27,670
I didn’t expect things would
turn out like this.

595
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,360
Zichen,

596
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,280
Shen Tianshu raided the dungeon

597
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,600
to break the Huos’ wing

598
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,600
and capture Huo Liantao

599
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,600
but got stopped by Mu Xiaoqiao

600
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,260
who refused to surrender.

601
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,430
It’s not a secret

602
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,120
that someone is behind Huo Liantao.

603
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,230
Timber Wolf

604
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,150
is looking for a man

605
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,870
while Blessed Dog

606
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:03,040
is after Miss and Mr. Wu

607
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,160
who escaped from the Inn.

608
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,430
Obviously, Shen Tianshu is here

609
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,910
for you.

610
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,740
Zichen,

611
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,630
didn’t you see

612
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,800
refugees in Huarong

613
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,080
outnumbered those elsewhere?

614
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,300
They know this place is safe.

615
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,020
Why?

616
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,630
Xie Yun, I...

617
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,950
Because you’re here.

618
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,390
Huo Liantao must’ve ordered his men

619
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,700
to not cause trouble in town.

620
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,710
Yet here you are

621
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,520
making yourself a target

622
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,520
and thinking no one would find you.

623
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,320
Xie Yun,

624
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,420
I understand what you said.

625
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,280
I came to Huarong

626
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,040
simply to

627
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,870
contact Huo Liantao in the first place.

628
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,470
I didn’t know

629
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,040
refugees would follow me here.

630
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:09,120
Seeing them homeless

631
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,710
and starving,

632
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,340
I couldn’t sit and do nothing.

633
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,060
So it was also you

634
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,650
who gave them

635
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,110
free food.

636
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,000
I knew that’d

637
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,380
get me into trouble,

638
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:35,600
but I couldn’t turn a blind eye

639
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,840
to those innocent people.

640
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,570
I’m sorry that I dragged you into this.

641
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,840
Zichen,

642
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:45,230
I’m proud

643
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,540
that you’d risk your life for others.

644
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,080
But the problem is,

645
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,120
although Shen Tianshu hasn’t found you,

646
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,470
the fact is you’re caged.

647
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,840
His men are searching door to door.

648
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,400
Two checkpoints are set up at the gate.

649
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,180
Even if there were ways to get out,

650
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,370
Mr. Bai wouldn’t allow you
to take such a risk.

651
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,910
What’s the use

652
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,750
of caging me?

653
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,630
What can he do about me?

654
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,950
If he’s trying to use me

655
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,390
to get Huo Liantao,

656
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,440
that’s not going to happen.

657
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,120
We aren’t

658
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,430
that close.

659
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,710
Right now, your troops

660
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,470
are stationed at the border.

661
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,360
They can get here

662
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,150
in seven or eight days.

663
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,700
Hearing that you’re in trouble,

664
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,700
even if your father knows
it could be a trap,

665
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,940
he’ll definitely take action.

666
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,800
But Shen Tianshu has no reason to do so.

667
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,560
Demons Manor aside,

668
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,430
what about Yu Wenzhi?

669
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,230
If something happens to a prince

670
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,750
in the enemy’s jurisdiction,

671
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,440
won’t Yu Wenzhi make a fuss?

672
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:51,930
Zichen,

673
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,400
you’re too naive.

674
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,720
Your Highness,

675
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,150
I’ve told you to leave

676
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,910
as soon as possible.

677
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:03,200
Mr. Xie also thinks the same.

678
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,920
Now it isn’t a good time.

679
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,600
Zichen, write a letter

680
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,120
to Huo Liantao.

681
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,500
Make sure Demons see it
delivered to Huo’s Manor.

682
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,890
If my guess is right,

683
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,430
our chance will soon come.

684
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,530
I’ve told you

685
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,500
the big black wolf outside

686
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,570
will eat you alive.

687
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,040
Ms. Duan,

688
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:54,840
are there ways

689
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,930
to take care of that wolf?

690
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,350
Simple.

691
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:04,600
Take ten moves from me first.

692
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,850
But you can’t.

693
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,580
My skills

694
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,360
are to

695
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,480
break the Snow-breaking Blade.

696
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,080
Li Zheng,

697
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,040
one more round?

698
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,560
Don’t be scared.

699
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,470
She won’t harm you.

700
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,180
What’s her relationship
with my grandfather?

701
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,000
I’ve never heard of her.

702
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,310
Can you fill me in?

703
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,270
That’s

704
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,210
a long story.

705
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,520
This way, please.

706
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:56,160
Back then, it was chaotic.

707
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:58,060
Turmoil ran amok everywhere.

708
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:03,320
I was serving a prestigious family.

709
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:06,080
Their eldest son

710
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,120
offended someone

711
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,710
who hired Demons
to slaughter his family.

712
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,430
I managed to get out

713
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:16,710
with a baby.

714
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,760
When we were attacked again on the way,

715
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,150
Ms. Duan saw it and helped us.

716
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,470
But she was outnumbered.

717
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:52,910
Then a man showed up out of nowhere.

718
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,680
Miss, leave with the baby.

719
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,270
How dare you

720
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,300
harm women and kids!

721
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,080
Are you still men?

722
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,040
So that’s how they met.

723
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,190
Who are you?

724
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:30,020
Tell us your name

725
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,350
so that we know who we killed.
