Bring some tea here.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,230
Coming.

21
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,360
Excuse me.

22
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,270
Yes, Miss.

23
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,160
Have you seen a young man
with Double Blades?

24
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,830
No.

25
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,120
Think again.

26
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,040
He came from this direction

27
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,870
and would’ve passed here.

28
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,590
I don’t remember seeing him.

29
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,190
You can check with others.

30
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,360
Hello, pretty.

31
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,390
Are you

32
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:11,000
looking for your husband?

33
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,110
Relax.

34
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,960
What was he thinking

35
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,600
that he left you alone?

36
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,550
Don’t worry.

37
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,830
I’ll look after you for him.

38
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,080
Get lost!

39
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,630
Thank you, sir.

40
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,360
I’ve seen the one you’re looking for.

41
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,720
Wait, sir.

42
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,000
My lord,

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,630
these are the tongues of those

44
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,600
who insulted Miss Wu.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,270
Feed them to the dogs.

46
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,190
Yes.

47
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,110
Where is she?

48
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,320
I think she’s heading to the woods

49
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,830
with that strange man.

50
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,270
Don’t worry.

51
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,670
She’s still under our watch.

52
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,520
Nothing will happen to her.

53
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,030
How can you be sure?

54
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,910
Where are the woods?

55
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,110
I will go there myself.

56
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,080
Yes.

57
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,160
And

58
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,470
get me some plain clothes.

59
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,000
I don’t want her to recognize me.

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,880
Yes.

61
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,080
Sir,

62
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,030
where are we going?

63
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,720
That man is about this tall

64
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,800
with Double Blades.

65
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,160
He seemed to be in a rush

66
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,360
as if he was looking for someone.

67
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,600
Yes. That’s him!

68
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,470
(Forbidden Forest)
I saw him

69
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,000
going into this forest.

70
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,240
Thank you for telling me.

71
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,960
I’m going in and look for him.

72
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,830
Hold on.

73
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,600
This place is dangerous.

74
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,440
Locals call it man-eating forest

75
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,920
in which demons disguise as aged plants

76
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,200
to mislead humans

77
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,720
and devour their souls.

78
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,880
Few can come out alive

79
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,670
once they enter there.

80
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,200
Really?

81
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,510
(Forbidden Forest)

82
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,600
The terrain seems unusual

83
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,350
but follows the Eight-trigram.

84
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,200
I heard some sects would use

85
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,270
such formations for safety

86
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,040
to keep outsiders away.

87
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,720
This forest must be one example.

88
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,880
I’m surprised

89
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,920
that you’re aware of that.

90
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,230
Do you know the way out?

91
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,480
I don’t.

92
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,000
I’ve only seen it once.

93
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,390
You don’t know?

94
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,440
I thought that man had told you.

95
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,720
What a waste of time!

96
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,200
Sir.

97
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,740
(Forbidden Forest)

98
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,440
Hey, beauty.

99
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,160
There’s no free meal.

100
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,320
Be honest with me.

101
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,110
Do you have the Seal of Cautiousness?

102
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,670
No.

103
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,720
Liar!

104
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,390
On the day of the Assembly,

105
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,070
the old bastard Chu Tianyu

106
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,830
stole that Seal from me,

107
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,200
but got killed by you.

108
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,880
If you don’t have it,

109
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,440
where else could it be?

110
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,950
That belongs to the Huos.

111
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,760
Why should I give it to you?

112
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,160
Listen,

113
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,040
don’t push me!

114
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,790
I thought

115
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,110
Phoenix was decent

116
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,550
and loyal.

117
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,040
Turns out

118
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,830
you’re no different

119
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,160
from those rats

120
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,510
who’d bite each other’s heads off

121
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,760
only for a bracelet.

122
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,110
Don’t degrade me to their level.

123
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,510
I want the Seal back

124
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,790
simply because it’s the Huos’.

125
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,720
That has nothing to do

126
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,230
with the bracelet.

127
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,880
I don’t buy it.

128
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,000
Whatever.

129
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,200
I heard it’s the key to divine skills.

130
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,040
Don’t you want them, Phoenix?

131
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,600
100 Destructive Palms are enough.

132
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,550
Why do I need other skills?

133
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,790
As inexperienced as I am,

134
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,640
I’ve been told

135
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:00,440
that you’re one of the most

136
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,790
talented.

137
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,040
You were aggressive years back

138
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,830
and your Palms

139
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,390
are a double-edged sword.

140
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,200
It’s invincible at the peak,

141
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,480
but once you go downhill,

142
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,760
so will your skills.

143
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,070
I had my doubts,

144
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,600
but now,

145
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,040
that seems to be true.

146
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,760
When I tested you,

147
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,790
your moves were a bit slow,

148
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,440
especially when I grabbed your jerkies.

149
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,510
Obviously,

150
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,720
your energy was low

151
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,110
which slowed down your Palms.

152
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,160
Otherwise,

153
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,510
how could I’ve dodged

154
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,640
the head of Four Guardians’ move?

155
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,320
Didn’t you see Zheng Luosheng

156
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,390
as the head?

157
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,200
He’s nothing!

158
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,070
Hey, beauty,

159
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,040
are you flattering me

160
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,880
or scaring me?

161
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,110
I know how skilled I am.

162
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,760
I’ve never placed any hope

163
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,510
on that bracelet.

164
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,230
I’m only after that Seal

165
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,440
because no one else deserves it

166
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,960
other than the Huos.

167
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,200
The snow is about to stop.

168
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,230
Phoenix,

169
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,670
once we’re out,

170
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,000
we’ll have to battle again.

171
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,470
I must say

172
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,840
you have a big heart.

173
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,080
Do you really believe

174
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,030
that I won’t kill you

175
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,350
in your sleep?

176
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,200
Phoenix doesn’t kill beauties.

177
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,520
You know me too well.

178
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,520
Fire Lotus is important to her.

179
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,550
They won’t leave

180
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,230
and must be somewhere close.

181
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,710
Wait.

182
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,080
I’ve been here three times.

183
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,470
The formation here

184
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,640
is more complicated
than that in the Huo’s.

185
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,400
What to do?

186
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,470
How did Sheng get out last time?

187
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,470
Miss, are you alright?

188
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,520
You’re...?

189
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,640
A...

190
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,000
A woodcutter.

191
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,550
How did you get through

192
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,790
the Eight-trigram Formation?

193
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,200
I don’t know anything

194
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,760
other than cutting wood.

195
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,760
Do you know the routes here?

196
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,710
My friend is inside.

197
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,320
Outsiders don’t know

198
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,080
there’s a cave deep in the woods.

199
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,520
A hothead with
Double Blades came earlier.

200
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,080
You must be looking for him, right?

201
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,880
Yes.

202
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,320
The cave

203
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,760
belonged to a school

204
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,960
that had been wiped out.

205
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,350
It’s right ahead.

206
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,110
You can go there yourself.

207
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,030
Thanks.

208
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,230
Sheng!

209
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,960
Sheng!

210
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,080
Chuchu,

211
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,350
how did you get here?

212
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,960
I asked around

213
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,670
and learned you left for this direction,

214
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,960
so I followed you here.

215
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,760
I came to

216
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,520
check on Mr. Chongxiao.

217
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,320
Hadn’t we agreed

218
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,520
to leave together

219
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,520
and I’d share your burden?

220
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,440
Yet you sneaked out alone.

221
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,280
I’m sorry.

222
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,400
It won’t happen again.

223
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,230
Wu Chuchu,

224
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,110
you’ll regret it.

225
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,710
Are you with the Qi School?

226
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,230
How did you know

227
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,280
the route?

228
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,960
I come in and out every day

229
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,520
to cut wood for a living.

230
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,230
I know this place like home.

231
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,520
Have you seen someone

232
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,080
with Double Blades?

233
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,840
You know him?

234
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,790
More than that.

235
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,030
He isn’t our member

236
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,550
but he stole our skills.

237
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,080
I must kill him!

238
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,590
How come no one is here?

239
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,230
It’s where the Qi School used to be.

240
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,710
Did something happen

241
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,080
to Mr. Chongxiao?

242
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,960
Feng Wuyan!

243
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,000
Hand over that thing!

244
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,150
What do you mean?

245
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,280
Don’t play dumb.

246
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,520
I saw you had that whisk at the inn.

247
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:06,670
Let go of her!

248
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,320
Only if you give me that whisk!

249
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,320
Don’t.

250
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,470
Get it yourself.

251
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,110
Let’s go!

252
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,110
A token of power.

253
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,520
From now on,

254
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,400
I’m the chief of the Qi School.

255
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,840
I am the chief!

256
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,030
Are you trying to kill me?

257
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,640
If not,

258
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,760
will you let me live?

259
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,030
Listen,

260
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,840
that old fart Chongxiao is dead.

261
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,520
He was killed

262
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,590
by the one who gave you the whisk.

263
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,760
A dead man’s wish isn’t important.

264
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,080
You will need me

265
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,280
if you want to be the chief.

266
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,350
How so?

267
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,000
If Mr. Chongxiao is gone,

268
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,520
I’m the only one left

269
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,960
with skills of the Qi School.

270
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,200
Alright.

271
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,200
Tell me everything

272
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,640
that Chongxiao

273
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,280
taught you

274
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,640
if you want to live.

275
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,670
I can do it myself.

276
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,150
One move

277
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,030
and skills of the Qi School
will be gone forever.

278
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,200
When I

279
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,590
see your ancestors down there,

280
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,790
what should I tell them?

281
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,740
(Great virtue is like water.)

282
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,030
It’s all your fault!

283
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,500
You’re useless.

284
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,790
(Great virtue is like water.)
Useless!

285
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,960
Useless!

286
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,030
What’s wrong? Stop beating yourself.

287
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,960
When I was young,

288
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,030
I didn’t take those skills seriously.

289
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,710
But now, they’re almost lost.

290
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,110
No one knows it except for you.

291
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,710
I have to rely on a stranger

292
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,000
to come home.

293
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,910
How could I be a chief?

294
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,200
I let my ancestors down!

295
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,590
My father was the chief,

296
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,050
but I refused to learn skills from him.

297
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,840
So

298
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,590
he favored Chongxiao.

299
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,800
Then I left in a rage.

300
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,560
I once

301
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,000
did the same.

302
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,350
Did you leave for real?

303
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,950
If not,

304
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,800
my father wouldn’t have

305
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,920
made Chongxiao the next chief so easily.

306
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,230
I lost

307
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,700
because I was young and stupid.

308
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,800
It was my fault.

309
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,470
Over the past 20 years,

310
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,160
this is the first time

311
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,410
I’ve ever come back

312
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,820
only to see Qi School become like this.

313
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,320
All these years,

314
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,190
have you regretted it?

315
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,190
Why?

316
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,070
Why should I?

317
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,560
I’m the black sheep of the family,

318
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,070
but everyone else is gone.

319
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,590
The former chief

320
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,520
got killed.

321
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,950
Why?

322
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,430
His skills were poor.

323
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,070
At this point,

324
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,950
only I can clean up the mess.

325
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,950
Tell me,

326
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,110
why should I regret it?

327
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,800
Why should I?

328
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,230
Hey,

329
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,160
others would be at each other’s throats

330
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,280
for that Seal,

331
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,160
while you’d give it up

332
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,350
so easily.

333
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,830
I can’t care less about any token

334
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,520
or that bracelet,

335
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,280
as long as it doesn’t

336
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,190
fall into the wrong hands.

337
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,590
Alright.

338
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,920
Since you don’t want it,

339
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,190
I’ll finish this show with you.

340
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,280
Once it’s over,

341
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,240
give me the Seal

342
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,760
and I’ll get you the Fire Lotus.

343
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
Sure.

344
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,310
Deal.

345
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,920
Deal.

346
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,640
Listen, give me the Seal

347
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,830
in exchange for your life.

348
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,310
Or I’ll kill you!

349
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,470
You want that Seal?

350
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,710
Go get it yourself.

351
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:53,950
You...

352
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,760
Zhou Fei!

353
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,880
The tips

354
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,880
are some basic math.

355
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,520
Math again! It gives me a headache.

356
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,590
Everyone has his or her strength.

357
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,400
I wasn’t a talented martial artist

358
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,760
and I always wondered

359
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,950
if I was too dumb.

360
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,110
But I mastered skills

361
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,590
of the Qi School

362
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,950
quite quickly

363
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,880
and learned more
than I had been taught.

364
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,680
You aren’t good at math,

365
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,500
but you’re obsessed with martial arts.

366
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,760
You’ve made great achievements

367
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,450
and don’t need to learn this.

368
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,750
I have to.

369
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,040
Or I’d be a laughing stock

370
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,470
if I didn’t have the necessary knowledge

371
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,710
as the chief of our school.

372
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,640
“Thunder is preferred in Eight-trigram,

373
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,230
so it’s placed at the third position.

374
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,590
Three positions form a whole

375
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,520
and shouldn’t be changed.

376
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,190
To guard one’s home,

377
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,190
place thunder at the third position

378
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,680
to create six positions...”

379
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,110
Ripple pattern?

380
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,070
Why is it here?

381
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,070
Is there anything wrong with it?

382
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,680
Sir,

383
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,400
did Mr. Chongxiao ever mention

384
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,160
The Color of Ocean and Heaven to you?

385
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,230
The Color of Ocean?

386
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:25,230
That geezer secluded
himself in the mountain.

387
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,040
How could he see the ocean?

388
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,110
Never mind.

389
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,760
Just checking.

390
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,190
My lord,

391
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,590
there might be a cave ahead.

392
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,110
Who could’ve gone through the woods

393
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,830
and made this far?

394
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,350
It’s my fault.

395
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,950
I shouldn’t have left those marks

396
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,830
and caused Sheng trouble.

397
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,470
Who are you?

398
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,880
What are you doing here?

399
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,560
My lord,

400
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,280
those marks found on the trees

401
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,880
seem to be telling the direction.

402
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,400
Someone must’ve

403
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,920
taken this path before us.

404
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,220
Sir!

405
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,470
She didn’t leave as you wished

406
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,430
but came back instead.

407
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,830
Young man,

408
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,880
there you are.

409
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,560
You must be one of

410
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,760
the seven stupid Demons.

411
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,800
I’m

412
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,950
Giant Leopard, Gu Tianxian.

413
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,000
You came uninvited.

414
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,160
What do you want?

415
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,640
Greetings, Black Judge.

416
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,520
No.

417
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,680
I’ve become the chief of the Qi School.

418
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,520
Is the whisk at his waist

419
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,280
the one Lord mentioned?

420
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,520
I see.

421
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,710
Chief Feng,

422
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,560
we barely know

423
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,430
or hold a grudge against each other.

424
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,400
A fight is unnecessary.

425
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,680
I don’t want any trouble.

426
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,950
Hand over

427
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,400
your whisk to me,

428
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,230
and we’ll leave

429
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,350
you and your school alone.

430
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,190
Deal?

431
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,470
How dare you steal my spot!

432
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,430
Ripple pattern?

433
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:23,590
The whisk bears that pattern, too.

434
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,710
Your tricks

435
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,520
are nothing new to me.

436
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,190
Wait.

437
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,520
You seem hell-bent

438
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,400
on battling me.

439
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,830
That brush

440
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,710
isn’t the weapon

441
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,640
members of the Qi School would use.

442
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,920
Those who don’t know

443
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,640
would assume

444
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,000
you had found that whisk somewhere

445
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,110
and proclaimed yourself chief.

446
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,430
Fine.

447
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,950
Let me show you

448
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,900
what our school is capable of.

449
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,430
Sir,

450
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,950
Qi’s skills are most unpredictable.

451
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,350
Weapons don’t matter.

452
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,880
Don’t be fooled by him.

453
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,470
That makes sense.

454
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,000
Too late.

455
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,880
Be careful! The whisk is poisoned!

456
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,230
Liar!

457
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,680
Chuchu!

458
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,430
Chuchu!

459
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,800
Don’t worry about me.

460
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,760
Go after them!

461
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,040
-Yes. Go!
-Let’s go!

462
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,830
Chuchu!

463
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,520
Chuchu!

464
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,160
Hang in there! Stay with me, Chuchu.

465
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,040
Chuchu.

466
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,760
Be careful.

467
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,040
What’s wrong?

468
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,640
I’m fine

469
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,190
with the Muyun Gauze.

470
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,510
Why did you take such a risk?

471
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,310
Let’s go see Madam Nichang.

472
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,590
She cured Fei

473
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,950
when she was badly injured.

474
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,470
I’m sure she can cure you, too.

475
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,950
(Lingling Inn)

476
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:14,110
“Back in Wuzhou,

477
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,920
you went uphill to see
Ganoderma sinense,

478
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,560
and sent stones to Jiangbei.

479
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:23,950
You went uphill
to see Ganoderma sinense”.

480
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,590
A man died to protect that secret.

481
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,640
I must keep it in mind.

482
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,920
Excuse me. Are you Miss Li Yan?

483
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,590
And you are...

484
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,280
Those kids in the temple

485
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,230
call me teacher.

486
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,830
Hearing that you’re
staying at Lingling Inn,

487
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,520
I’m here to thank you.

488
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,590
So you’re their teacher.

489
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,680
I’m sorry.

490
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,280
They got into trouble because of us.

491
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,230
Please have a seat.

492
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,470
Thanks.

493
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,760
Good.

494
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,160
Girls of your Fortress

495
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,920
are well-bred and considerate.

496
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,230
No wonder Anzhi risked his life

497
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,830
to save you.

498
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,920
Anzhi?

499
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,160
That’s Xie Yun’s courtesy name.

500
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,830
(Teacher Lin Immortal of Penglai)
I’m Xie Yun’s uncle.

501
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,110
Is it true?

502
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,070
I thought

503
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,430
he had come out of nowhere.

504
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,830
It’s true

505
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,000
that he seldom

506
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,680
tells others about his background.

507
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,230
Learning that

508
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,280
he had used the Cloud-impelling Palm,

509
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,590
I knew

510
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,710
his life would be in danger.

511
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,640
That’s why

512
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,760
I came out

513
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,950
to bring him back for treatment

514
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,710
but that old monk Tongming,

515
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,110
Xie Yun’s master,

516
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,310
beat me to it.

517
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,000
So I could only go back.

518
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,110
On my way,

519
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,830
I ran into a group of homeless kids

520
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:06,000
and couldn’t turn a blind eye to them,

521
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,000
so I planned

522
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,310
to take them to the south

523
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:14,350
but got stopped by you and the Demons.

524
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,310
You’re Xie Yun’s uncle?

525
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,710
That’s great!

526
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,710
Could you tell him for me

527
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,640
that I’ve found clues to that bracelet?

528
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,110
There’s a poem on a map...

529
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,350
Alright, alright.

530
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,190
Tell him yourself

531
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,000
when you see him next time.

532
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I can’t wait that long.

533
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,430
My memory is bad.

534
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,550
I don’t want to ruin anything.

535
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,560
Young lady,

536
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,520
you’ve managed

537
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,230
to escape

538
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,920
from those Demons.

539
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,920
Don’t underestimate yourself.

540
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,040
I’m going back to Penglai.

541
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,710
Once Anzhi wakes up,

542
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:45,000
I’ll let him know.

543
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,710
He’ll come to you

544
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,000
if he wants that bracelet.

545
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,560
You’re still here!

546
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,760
Good boy!

547
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,920
Horses are most trustworthy.

548
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,920
Every being should be respected,

549
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:10,470
not to mention
our most loyal friends, horses.

550
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,560
If you’re good to them,

551
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,230
they’ll live and die with you

552
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,310
and never abandon you.

553
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,310
Thank you, Phoenix.

554
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,280
When I’m back,

555
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,920
I’ll wait for you at Lingling Inn

556
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,710
and give you the Seal.

557
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,350
Here’s a friendly reminder.

558
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,430
Your skills are bad for your health.

559
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,950
Use them as less as possible.

560
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,350
Listen to yourself.

561
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,040
Are we that close?

562
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,760
Why do you care

563
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,350
so much about my health?

564
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,640
Hey, beauty,

565
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,400
this is the last time I trust others.

566
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,280
Don’t let me down.

567
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:21,430
Xie Meimei, I’m back.

568
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,920
Wait for me!

569
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,640
Excuse me,

570
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,950
have you seen

571
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,310
the heiress to the South Blade,

572
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,160
Miss Zhou Fei?

573
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,800
Sir,

574
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,710
I’m a businessman

575
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,000
and I know little

576
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,310
about those martial artists,

577
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,400
you know.

578
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,230
She’s not too tall

579
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,230
with a long blade,

580
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,950
and she looks fierce and pretty.

581
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,070
Help! Help!

582
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:13,880
Sir!

583
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,710
Mr. Li, what happened to Miss Wu?

584
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,880
Can’t talk right now.

585
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,950
The Route Gang is well-connected.

586
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,280
Could you ask around

587
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,920
and tell me where Madam Nichang

588
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,800
and the Yuyi Troupe are?

589
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,950
After the Assembly,

590
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,160
she decided to retire

591
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,760
and returned to Qiaoyun House
in Hengyang.

592
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,830
Hengyang?

593
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,000
-Yes.
-Thanks.

594
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,520
Get me a carriage.

595
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,590
-We’re going there.
-Yes.

596
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,590
Are you Miss Zhou Fei’s cousin?

597
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,640
If you’re in a rush,

598
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,160
you can take our carriage.

599
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,710
Young Master Zhu.

600
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:38,710
That’s great.

601
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:39,590
Thanks a ton.

602
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,520
Don’t mention it, Mr. Li.

603
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,430
Let’s go.

604
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,280
Without Miss Zhou,

605
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,040
half of our members would’ve been killed

606
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,800
by Ding Kui before the Assembly.

607
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,350
Now, we’re at your disposal.

608
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:01,430
Two, three, three, three,
four, left, right.

609
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,710
Left, right.

610
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,230
What is this nonsense?

611
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,400
Are you a member of the Qi School?

612
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,560
If I knew the way out,

613
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,280
I would’ve ditched you long ago.

614
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,430
Alright.

615
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,950
I’ll cut down all trees.

616
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:28,000
Then we can get out.

617
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,040
I dare you!

618
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,040
Stay away from

619
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,040
what belongs to our school.

620
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,070
Touch it

621
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,710
and I’ll kill you.

622
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,280
Commander,

623
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,470
Lord doesn’t receive any guests.

624
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:55,070
I’m here to say goodbye.

625
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,070
Let him in.

626
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:01,880
Yes.

627
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,560
Tianying,

628
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,080
long time no see.

629
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,520
Your flowers have grown even better.

630
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,190
Did you show up unannounced

631
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,760
only to see my flowers?

632
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,000
I dare not

633
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,600
go anywhere near them.

634
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,040
Then why are you here?

635
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:29,800
We maintain an army
to use it when necessary.

636
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,280
Ever since General Wu Fei’s incident
was exposed,

637
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,190
tokens with ripple patterns
have appeared,

638
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:37,630
but the Demons have failed repeatedly.

639
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,680
What’s the point

640
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,650
of supporting them now?

641
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:48,870
Are you abandoning us?

642
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:52,080
When Xiao Chuan clobbered you,

643
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,430
you begged me

644
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:55,670
to poison him with Bone-chilling.

645
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,520
But that didn’t kill him.

646
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,230
That was pure luck.

647
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,500
I didn’t fail.

648
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,000
Yu Wenzhi,

649
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,080
if you go back on your word

650
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,470
and betray the Demons,

651
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,230
you know the consequence.

652
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,600
A commander like you

653
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,520
should be careful with

654
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,230
what you say and do.

655
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,710
Tianying,

656
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,470
you killed Li Zheng,

657
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,390
poisoned Xiao Chuan
and robbed the Big Medicine Valley,

658
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,560
leaving the world in awe.

659
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,280
That’s why I chose to
work with the Demons

660
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,950
to look for
The Color of Ocean and Heaven.

661
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,190
And what now?

662
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,470
You lost miserably

663
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,470
to a little girl.

664
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,630
I’m utterly disappointed.

665
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:41,040
There’s still hope

666
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,190
before that token is found.

667
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,840
Unless you join the game.

668
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,910
Never mind.

669
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,830
I know you’ve already retired

670
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,800
and you’re too busy enjoying your life

671
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,040
in this manor

672
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,430
with Lord Shen.

673
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,600
You don’t have time

674
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,800
for my trifle.

675
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,390
I should leave.

676
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,160
Good day.

677
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,880
Hold on.

678
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,710
What did they say?

679
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,080
I didn’t hear it clearly

680
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,800
from afar.

681
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,360
Once it’s done,

682
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,200
you must give Tianshu

683
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,630
whatever he wants

684
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,320
in those treasures.

685
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:40,600
Only if you find them first.

686
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:52,560
According to Tong Tianyang’s message,

687
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:56,040
Chongxiao is one of the guardians

688
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,540
of that bracelet.

689
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,600
If my guess is right,

690
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,750
the hidden treasures must be
near the Big Medicine Valley.

691
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,490
Tianxian,

692
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:07,320
check that area.

693
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,150
Let me know

694
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,630
if you find anything.

695
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,090
Brother,

696
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:16,470
I’ll find them for you

697
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,560
at all costs.

698
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,470
My friend,

699
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,800
drink as much as you want.

700
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,390
There’s more.

701
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,790
Miss.

702
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,330
You must be Miss Zhou Fei, right?

703
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,540
You know me?

704
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,520
Anzhi was

705
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,840
mumbling your name

706
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,670
even in his coma.

707
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,670
You found it?

708
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,390
Good!

709
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,800
Excellent!

710
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,910
Miss, Miss!

711
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,150
Miss!

712
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,360
Miss Zhou put her life on the line

713
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,750
and went all the way

714
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,680
to bring this Fire Lotus back

715
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,710
to save you.

716
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,510
That’s cold.

717
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,640
But don’t worry.

718
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,140
Although she drained herself,

719
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,000
she’s back safe and sound.

720
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:14,080
Heaven must be

721
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,630
having mercy on you for your past

722
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,000
so that you’re still alive

723
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,040
and have met Miss Zhou Fei.

724
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,840
Madam!

725
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,470
Take good care of yourself.

726
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,360
It’s about time that you wake up.

727
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,710
But too bad...

728
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:04,980
Bad?

729
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,080
What’s bad?

730
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,190
Everything is fine.

731
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,910
Anzhi is feeling much better

732
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,520
after taking the second herb.

733
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,430
When I said bad,

734
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,430
I meant the timing.

735
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,040
The herb brought him
out of his coma.

736
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,430
He was waiting for you

737
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:24,840
but had to

738
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,390
go back to meditate yesterday.

739
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,120
That’s good news.

740
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,190
I’ll go get him the third herb,

741
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,490
Flaming Sage.

742
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:45,910
Hold your horses.

743
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,840
It’s seldom seen

744
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,120
and said

745
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,840
to only grow in the hot South Xinjiang.

746
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,280
That’s a thousand miles

747
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,560
from here.

748
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,190
South Xinjiang?

749
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,910
Where the Small Medicine Valley is?

750
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,190
Correct.

751
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:09,360
As the head of that Valley,

752
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,280
Yang Jin must know something.

753
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,870
Even if he doesn’t,

754
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:16,000
I can ask Ying Hecong about it.

755
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,520
Zhou Fei,

756
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,000
I know you’re in a rush,

757
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,000
but it’ll take more than two weeks

758
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,490
to get there.

759
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,520
A few moments won’t delay anything.

760
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,290
With

761
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,810
such a long journey ahead,

762
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,720
you should be physically prepared.

763
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,810
Look at you.

764
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,040
When was the last time you slept?

765
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,470
However strong you are,

766
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:42,200
you can’t keep doing this to yourself.

767
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,520
Who is it?

768
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,800
If there’s anything good

769
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,080
about that brat,

770
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,150
that is, he has good taste.

771
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,520
Look.

772
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,600
He’s found himself such a pretty girl.

773
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,800
Have you studied the Four Books?

774
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:13,150
Which one of the Five Classics
do you like?

775
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,840
I’ve read neither of them.

776
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,760
My father did teach me
Thousand Character Classic though.

777
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,630
I can recite that if you want.

778
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,000
That won’t do.

779
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,360
Listen,

780
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,910
you should study more

781
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,910
if you want to be part of our family.

782
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,560
You are weird.

783
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:31,910
You didn’t raise me

784
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,390
or teach me anything.

785
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,320
Who are you to lecture me?

786
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,080
Well,

787
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,560
you know,

788
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:44,670
there are four Immortals of Penglai.

789
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,800
Other than Anzhi’s deceased uncle,

790
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,630
there are

791
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,190
me,

792
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:54,670
this terrible teacher Lin

793
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:55,950
and

794
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,000
that old fisherman

795
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,080
who brought you here.

796
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:03,670
You hear that?

797
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:04,870
I’m your uncle.

798
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:06,190
What?

799
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:07,870
You aren’t qualified.

800
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,520
Alright.

801
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,710
Say whatever you want.

802
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,630
You’ll acknowledge me sooner or later.

803
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,710
Where’s my blade?

804
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,430
Where are your manners?

805
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:18,840
So rude!

806
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,080
Show some respect!

807
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:22,280
How were you raised

808
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,760
in your Fortress?

809
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,870
How come you’re nothing

810
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,560
like your cousin?

811
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,600
You’ve seen Li Yan,

812
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,800
my cousin?

813
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,230
Is she in trouble?

814
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:33,760
Nonsense!

815
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,950
What trouble

816
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,430
could that sweet pea get into?

817
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:38,430
Come on!

818
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:39,920
Sweet pea?

819
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:45,000
Are you sure

820
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,140
that’s our Li Yan?

821
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:51,560
Don’t practice any skills

822
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,030
before you’re fully recovered.

823
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,030
Your energy is running wild.

824
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,430
Stop using it for a while.

825
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:01,320
Tianying,

826
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:05,530
do you think all that I’m doing

827
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,680
is useless?

828
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,400
Do you remember

829
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:13,630
