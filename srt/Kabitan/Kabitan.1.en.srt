1
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:38,861
I’ll accept anything.

2
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:50,266
Even just remnants of your love.

3
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,179
I am willing to wait.

4
00:03:15,747 --> 00:03:19,751
As long as you’re only
mine during our time.

5
00:03:24,943 --> 00:03:26,441
That’s enough for me.

6
00:05:25,084 --> 00:05:26,471
Yes, yes, yes.

7
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,460
I’ll be home soon, hon.

8
00:05:28,523 --> 00:05:30,274
I’ve been swamped with paper works.

9
00:05:30,582 --> 00:05:31,760
Yes, I’m on my way home.

10
00:05:31,785 --> 00:05:33,078
I love you.

11
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,421
I’m going home, babe.

12
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,655
Love you.

13
00:05:41,885 --> 00:05:42,885
I’m going.

14
00:05:55,307 --> 00:05:56,359
Hi!

15
00:05:58,167 --> 00:05:59,167
Hello.

16
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,980
Are you okay?

17
00:06:05,154 --> 00:06:06,336
I’m okay.

18
00:06:23,528 --> 00:06:24,802
Baby, how are you?

19
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:26,828
I’m okay.

20
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:27,944
I miss you.

21
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:29,970
Already?

22
00:06:30,138 --> 00:06:31,889
I was just there yesterday.

23
00:06:32,837 --> 00:06:33,921
Sorry.

24
00:06:33,946 --> 00:06:35,225
You’re really cute.

25
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:36,735
No need to say sorry.

26
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,357
How’s your new condo unit?

27
00:06:38,512 --> 00:06:40,342
Have you started to unpack?

28
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,618
Yes, babe.

29
00:06:41,643 --> 00:06:43,978
It’s exhausting, but fun.

30
00:06:44,644 --> 00:06:45,645
Thank you!

31
00:06:45,746 --> 00:06:47,208
I’m glad that you’re happy.

32
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,404
I hope you’re here, babe.

33
00:06:49,795 --> 00:06:51,046
Sorry, babe.

34
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:52,532
I’ll make it up to you.

35
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,584
Love you.

36
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,372
I love you too, babe.

37
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,906
- Aw, please.
- No, I have to go to the office.

38
00:07:07,931 --> 00:07:10,092
My wife is looking for me.

39
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:11,827
Don't leave yet!

40
00:07:11,952 --> 00:07:18,803
[background chatter]

41
00:07:47,527 --> 00:07:49,665
Hon, please don’t leave.

42
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,305
You said that today is my day.

43
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,407
Alice.

44
00:07:53,888 --> 00:07:56,134
- I told you, I need to leave.
- Please.

45
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,532
My wife needs me.

46
00:07:58,921 --> 00:08:00,298
Don’t leave.

47
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,480
Hon.

48
00:08:03,505 --> 00:08:04,548
Come on.

49
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:43,414
Baby, how are you?

50
00:09:44,753 --> 00:09:46,046
I miss you.

51
00:09:47,023 --> 00:09:48,233
I miss you too.

52
00:09:48,336 --> 00:09:50,163
It’s already late, baby.

53
00:09:50,713 --> 00:09:52,632
Good thing my phone is in silent mode.

54
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,302
We might get caught.

55
00:09:56,739 --> 00:09:57,897
Baby...

56
00:10:00,205 --> 00:10:01,311
Love...

57
00:10:03,814 --> 00:10:05,524
Please come here.

58
00:10:06,771 --> 00:10:08,481
I want to see you.

59
00:10:10,816 --> 00:10:12,526
I’m getting horny.

60
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:18,078
Okay.

61
00:10:18,282 --> 00:10:19,861
Hold your tits.

62
00:10:20,034 --> 00:10:23,913
Imagine I am holding
and kissing you right now.

63
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:29,668
You like that?

64
00:10:37,423 --> 00:10:38,632
You like it?

65
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:46,566
Hold your boobs firmly.

66
00:10:51,434 --> 00:10:54,418
Imagine that I am kissing you right now.

67
00:11:18,217 --> 00:11:21,137
I’m going to penetrate you now.

68
00:11:30,646 --> 00:11:36,861
Touch yourself downward
until you reach your pussy.

69
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:46,162
Is it good?

70
00:11:46,162 --> 00:11:48,497
Are you getting hornier with me?

71
00:12:00,301 --> 00:12:02,636
Touch your tits, babe.

72
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:16,025
Please come here.

73
00:12:17,818 --> 00:12:20,613
Love, did you buy some milk?

74
00:12:23,036 --> 00:12:24,289
Baby?

75
00:12:25,326 --> 00:12:26,744
Baby?

76
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:28,547
Baby?

77
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:51,869
Waiter.

78
00:12:51,894 --> 00:12:52,894
I’ll have one.

79
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:00,818
Thank you.

80
00:13:11,163 --> 00:13:12,163
Are you okay?

81
00:13:19,505 --> 00:13:20,505
You know what?

82
00:13:20,813 --> 00:13:24,176
I've asked you twice if you’re okay.

83
00:13:24,201 --> 00:13:26,536
And both your answers were yes.

84
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:27,903
But...

85
00:13:27,928 --> 00:13:29,731
Your face says different.

86
00:13:35,311 --> 00:13:36,348
Alice.

87
00:13:36,938 --> 00:13:38,273
Liz for short.

88
00:13:44,372 --> 00:13:45,707
Mika.

89
00:13:46,508 --> 00:13:48,315
Mika for short...

90
00:13:52,526 --> 00:13:53,581
Sorry.

91
00:13:53,606 --> 00:13:55,213
I don’t have a nickname.

92
00:13:57,445 --> 00:13:58,530
So...

93
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,893
Why are you drinking by yourself?

94
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,627
And it seems like you are sad.

95
00:14:04,007 --> 00:14:05,258
Where is your boyfriend?

96
00:14:07,982 --> 00:14:08,982
He’s busy.

97
00:14:19,535 --> 00:14:20,535
How about you?

98
00:14:23,393 --> 00:14:24,393
Uhm...

99
00:14:24,878 --> 00:14:26,046
He’s also busy.

100
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,491
Busy with his wife.

101
00:14:30,997 --> 00:14:31,997
Huh?

102
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:33,267
You’re a mistress?

103
00:14:34,381 --> 00:14:35,381
Shhh!

104
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:48,045
How can you talk about
being a mistress to a stranger?

105
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,531
And it seems like you’re proud of it.

106
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:55,779
Why?

107
00:14:56,155 --> 00:14:58,203
Should I talk about it with my mom?

108
00:14:59,418 --> 00:15:02,813
And besides, you seem trustworthy.

109
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,920
You’re judging me.

110
00:15:06,663 --> 00:15:08,570
Congratulations with your happy love life.

111
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,672
I’m not judging you.

112
00:15:16,227 --> 00:15:20,507
What if I tell you
that we’re the same?

113
00:15:29,176 --> 00:15:30,636
Are you serious?

114
00:15:40,786 --> 00:15:42,079
Mistress.

115
00:15:42,104 --> 00:15:43,397
Concubine.

116
00:15:43,588 --> 00:15:44,588
Other woman.

117
00:15:46,253 --> 00:15:47,379
You’re also a mistress?

118
00:15:56,745 --> 00:15:57,705
So with that...

119
00:15:57,746 --> 00:15:58,914
Hi best friend!

120
00:15:59,248 --> 00:16:00,416
Cheers!

121
00:18:32,016 --> 00:18:33,793
Oh, good morning.

122
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,176
Sorry about last night.

123
00:18:36,201 --> 00:18:37,578
If I said something...

124
00:18:37,603 --> 00:18:40,074
Let’s just keep it between us. Please.

125
00:18:43,412 --> 00:18:45,152
Why are you in a hurry?

126
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:46,839
Let’s eat first.

127
00:18:47,901 --> 00:18:50,714
It’s okay, I have food at home.

128
00:18:54,698 --> 00:18:56,863
I thought we’re friends now?

129
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:02,169
I’ll go now.

130
00:20:25,926 --> 00:20:26,926
Um...

131
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:30,150
I cooked a lot of carbonara.

132
00:20:30,795 --> 00:20:32,129
Would you like some?

133
00:20:32,604 --> 00:20:33,656
Come on.

134
00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:34,681
Let’s eat.

135
00:20:45,973 --> 00:20:47,975
He doesn’t come home yet?

136
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:02,177
Do you know that
there are many ways

137
00:21:02,202 --> 00:21:05,268
to always make
a person come back to you?

138
00:21:12,634 --> 00:21:13,714
How?

139
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:20,924
I can teach you.

140
00:21:21,606 --> 00:21:23,581
To make him go crazy over you.

141
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,111
Van.

142
00:21:33,741 --> 00:21:35,244
His name is Van.

143
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:37,251
Well...

144
00:21:37,371 --> 00:21:39,714
Are you ready for Van
to go crazy over you?

145
00:21:58,591 --> 00:22:00,343
Three rules.

146
00:22:01,356 --> 00:22:02,356
One.

147
00:22:02,931 --> 00:22:04,196
Dress better.

148
00:23:20,003 --> 00:23:21,213
Number two.

149
00:23:21,621 --> 00:23:23,105
Look better.

150
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:56,739
And number three

151
00:23:57,334 --> 00:24:00,099
Make him feel better.

152
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:09,005
Because guys want the
feeling of being desired.

153
00:24:10,021 --> 00:24:11,523
Worshipped.

154
00:24:11,773 --> 00:24:13,275
Praised.

155
00:24:18,567 --> 00:24:22,136
Pull him in slowly.

156
00:24:23,538 --> 00:24:25,652
This is what you need to do.

157
00:24:27,952 --> 00:24:28,953
Bend over.

158
00:24:36,813 --> 00:24:37,973
Bend it more.

159
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:46,371
Always do this, so Van
won’t go home to his wife.

160
00:24:56,945 --> 00:24:58,012
Open.

161
00:25:01,861 --> 00:25:04,457
Do this when he’s laying down.

162
00:25:29,255 --> 00:25:30,256
Is it okay?

163
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,922
Hold his hand.

164
00:25:38,344 --> 00:25:40,125
And put it on your neck.

165
00:26:02,946 --> 00:26:03,946
Do it like this.

166
00:26:27,897 --> 00:26:28,897
Like this.

167
00:26:59,137 --> 00:27:00,394
You get it?

168
00:31:50,803 --> 00:31:52,668
Hi babe! Happy birthday!

169
00:31:53,973 --> 00:31:54,973
Hello babe.

170
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:56,350
I love you!

171
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:57,375
Thank you!

172
00:31:57,435 --> 00:31:59,027
How are you? What are you doing?

173
00:31:59,531 --> 00:32:01,340
I’m just cooking breakfast.

174
00:32:01,365 --> 00:32:03,605
Later, I’ll buy food for dinner.

175
00:32:03,983 --> 00:32:05,316
What do you want?

176
00:32:06,496 --> 00:32:08,097
Sorry, babe.

177
00:32:08,247 --> 00:32:10,769
I might not be able to go there later.

178
00:32:11,282 --> 00:32:12,754
My wife is sick.

179
00:32:13,242 --> 00:32:15,152
Nobody will watch the kids.

180
00:32:16,162 --> 00:32:17,330
Sorry, babe.

181
00:32:17,538 --> 00:32:18,800
I’ll make it up to you.

182
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:08,422
Hi! Good morning.

183
00:33:14,178 --> 00:33:16,047
You’re always like that.

184
00:33:16,722 --> 00:33:20,602
You look sad every time I see you.

185
00:33:26,357 --> 00:33:27,566
Where are you going?

186
00:33:29,235 --> 00:33:31,125
I'm going to buy food.

187
00:33:31,735 --> 00:33:32,905
It’s my birthday.

188
00:33:33,864 --> 00:33:35,687
Wait. It’s your birthday?

189
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:37,289
Happy birthday!

190
00:33:37,785 --> 00:33:38,785
So...

191
00:33:38,911 --> 00:33:40,641
Are you going to celebrate later?

192
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:42,367
With Van?

193
00:33:43,874 --> 00:33:44,874
No.

194
00:33:48,212 --> 00:33:49,305
He’s busy.

195
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,218
Mika.

196
00:34:22,872 --> 00:34:24,331
Happy birthday!

197
00:34:25,374 --> 00:34:27,644
It’s not fun to celebrate alone.

198
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,130
Well...

199
00:34:32,732 --> 00:34:35,651
What if you forget about
your problems for once?

200
00:34:35,676 --> 00:34:36,988
And let’s enjoy the night.

201
00:36:33,502 --> 00:36:34,502
Alice.

202
00:36:34,837 --> 00:36:36,403
Why did you become a mistress?

203
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,966
He made me a mistress.

204
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:47,184
At first,

205
00:36:47,978 --> 00:36:50,520
I thought it was just me.

206
00:36:53,355 --> 00:36:57,005
But when I fell for him...

207
00:37:00,195 --> 00:37:04,739
He admitted that he has a family.

208
00:37:08,454 --> 00:37:09,872
I just accepted it.

209
00:37:10,539 --> 00:37:12,875
I’m okay to be his mistress,

210
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,500
rather than nothing.

211
00:37:15,669 --> 00:37:16,669
How about you?

212
00:37:17,755 --> 00:37:19,614
Why did you agree to be a mistress?

213
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:24,052
During the time when I was sad...

214
00:37:24,746 --> 00:37:27,206
He was the one who came to comfort me.

215
00:37:27,765 --> 00:37:29,591
I can feel it sometimes.

216
00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:31,747
That he loves me.

217
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,312
Even if...

218
00:37:34,897 --> 00:37:36,255
He has his own family.

219
00:37:39,693 --> 00:37:40,802
Sometimes?

220
00:37:43,572 --> 00:37:45,528
That’s how it is, Alice.

221
00:37:46,244 --> 00:37:50,206
We only accept the love
that they can only give.

222
00:37:52,373 --> 00:37:53,999
Even if you have to share?

223
00:37:56,502 --> 00:37:57,753
What if?

224
00:37:58,045 --> 00:37:59,046
Let’s be together?

225
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:07,592
You’re gonna make me a mistress again.

226
00:38:07,888 --> 00:38:09,014
Are you crazy?

227
00:38:09,807 --> 00:38:10,807
Why?

228
00:38:11,308 --> 00:38:12,905
Can you love me?

229
00:38:13,477 --> 00:38:15,101
Where I can be your only one?

230
00:38:15,854 --> 00:38:18,214
The kind of love where you
won’t go home with someone else.

231
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,470
Yes!

232
00:38:21,193 --> 00:38:23,069
You’re not that hard to love.

233
00:38:25,383 --> 00:38:27,272
I’ve heard that before.

234
00:38:33,664 --> 00:38:35,275
Do you want to know how it feels like?

235
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:36,820
How to be loved?

236
00:47:25,548 --> 00:47:30,159
[game playing on phone]

237
00:47:30,184 --> 00:47:31,452
Yes, hon.

238
00:47:32,265 --> 00:47:35,038
My boss is giving me extra workload.

239
00:47:35,063 --> 00:47:36,382
I’m getting irritated.

240
00:47:37,068 --> 00:47:40,071
I’ll just go home early tomorrow.

241
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:42,045
Yes, hon.

242
00:47:43,202 --> 00:47:45,507
I’ll just buy more diapers.

243
00:47:46,858 --> 00:47:47,859
Bye, hon!

244
00:47:47,884 --> 00:47:48,991
Love you!

245
00:47:58,979 --> 00:47:59,980
Babe.

246
00:48:00,605 --> 00:48:01,606
Babe.

247
00:48:02,749 --> 00:48:03,775
Babe.

248
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,407
Why are you ignoring me?

249
00:48:05,944 --> 00:48:08,321
Later, I’m still playing.

250
00:48:08,978 --> 00:48:10,280
What’s that?

251
00:48:10,686 --> 00:48:11,735
Playtime.

252
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,804
I can sometimes scatter here.

253
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,809
So I can save some
money to pay for this condo.

254
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:20,382
I see. How do you play that?

255
00:48:25,288 --> 00:48:26,506
Like this.

256
00:48:26,915 --> 00:48:29,233
Go to Playtime.ph.

257
00:48:29,858 --> 00:48:33,013
Then just cash-in
with your e-wallet.

258
00:48:33,038 --> 00:48:36,041
Then just choose a game to play.

259
00:48:36,683 --> 00:48:37,809
Look at this.

260
00:48:40,115 --> 00:48:43,561
There are many games to choose from.

261
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,483
Here.

262
00:48:51,156 --> 00:48:52,156
Look!

263
00:48:53,074 --> 00:48:54,202
There!

264
00:48:56,661 --> 00:48:57,661
See!

265
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,280
I got scatter already.

266
00:48:59,664 --> 00:49:01,022
Winner!

267
00:49:02,016 --> 00:49:03,655
Nice! Let’s try again.

268
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,483
Let’s see if you’re really lucky.

269
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,952
Let’s see.

270
00:49:12,235 --> 00:49:13,403
Son of a bitch!

271
00:49:13,428 --> 00:49:15,327
You’re really lucky, babe!

272
00:49:15,597 --> 00:49:17,890
But I’m the luckiest with you.

273
00:49:19,351 --> 00:49:20,352
Smooth talker!

274
00:49:20,438 --> 00:49:21,788
I’m not a game.

275
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,491
But you’re playing with me.

276
00:49:23,688 --> 00:49:25,905
Hey, easy there!

277
00:49:26,087 --> 00:49:27,295
I’m not like that.

278
00:49:27,734 --> 00:49:28,777
I love you!

279
00:49:29,673 --> 00:49:30,673
Because of that...

280
00:49:31,749 --> 00:49:33,429
You will treat me.

281
00:49:34,043 --> 00:49:35,187
You got scatter.

282
00:49:50,715 --> 00:49:54,382
You didn’t say that you are coming over.

283
00:49:56,805 --> 00:49:58,682
Damn investors!

284
00:49:59,516 --> 00:50:00,836
They pulled out from the project.

285
00:50:05,477 --> 00:50:06,677
Unbelievable...

286
00:50:08,108 --> 00:50:09,108
Calm down.

287
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,203
I made just one mistake.

288
00:50:12,088 --> 00:50:13,976
They pulled me out of the project.

289
00:50:21,496 --> 00:50:23,206
Damn it.

290
00:50:24,582 --> 00:50:25,582
Calm down.

291
00:50:45,103 --> 00:50:46,103
Calm down.

292
00:51:03,663 --> 00:51:05,123
Wait, calm down.

293
00:51:06,194 --> 00:51:08,196
I need this.

294
00:51:17,244 --> 00:51:18,699
Stop it.

295
00:51:39,301 --> 00:51:40,875
Michael.

296
00:52:59,487 --> 00:53:00,487
Who are you?

297
00:53:07,078 --> 00:53:08,538
Are you Mika?

298
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:10,621
Yes.

299
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:11,688
Who are you?

300
00:53:13,676 --> 00:53:15,840
Shhh...

301
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:21,466
Is Van here?

302
00:53:22,802 --> 00:53:24,169
I’m his wife.

303
00:53:26,848 --> 00:53:32,604
I saw your messages in his phone.

304
00:53:36,816 --> 00:53:38,359
He’s shameless.

305
00:53:40,618 --> 00:53:42,681
You have a lot of nerve.

306
00:53:48,202 --> 00:53:49,746
He’s shameless.

307
00:53:52,165 --> 00:53:53,708
Home wrecker!

308
00:53:56,461 --> 00:53:58,880
You know that he has a family, right?

309
00:54:02,508 --> 00:54:04,590
You know that he has a child!

310
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:06,503
A girl!

311
00:54:09,844 --> 00:54:11,190
Are you not ashamed?

312
00:54:11,914 --> 00:54:13,527
Are you not ashamed?!

313
00:54:19,233 --> 00:54:20,448
Don’t worry.

314
00:54:22,946 --> 00:54:24,433
I won't make a scandal here.

315
00:54:24,509 --> 00:54:26,854
Because I’m not that kind of woman.

316
00:54:28,802 --> 00:54:31,792
I’m not a cheap person like you!

317
00:54:37,794 --> 00:54:42,783
I hope that when the time
comes that you have a child...

318
00:54:44,902 --> 00:54:46,946
They'll know that you’re a mistress!

319
00:54:49,222 --> 00:54:51,265
And they'll be ashamed of you!

320
00:55:12,011 --> 00:55:14,777
Mika, it's okay...

321
00:55:17,172 --> 00:55:18,377
It's okay.

322
00:55:18,506 --> 00:55:20,714
Why are you saying that “it’s okay”?

323
00:55:21,187 --> 00:55:22,647
You saw that, right?

324
00:55:22,672 --> 00:55:24,424
I got slapped by reality.

325
00:55:24,449 --> 00:55:26,284
I got slapped by his wife.

326
00:55:29,137 --> 00:55:30,304
Isn’t that what you want?

327
00:55:30,414 --> 00:55:32,640
You and Van can now be together.

328
00:55:37,883 --> 00:55:39,689
What are you talking about?

329
00:55:40,335 --> 00:55:43,250
It’s easy for you to play
with people’s feelings.

330
00:55:44,068 --> 00:55:45,985
You’re even playing with me.

331
00:55:48,031 --> 00:55:49,574
Mika!

332
00:56:51,969 --> 00:56:54,639
Sometimes, that's how it is.

333
00:56:56,265 --> 00:56:58,726
No matter how careful we are...

334
00:57:00,103 --> 00:57:03,742
Destiny will find its way to punish us.

335
00:57:03,884 --> 00:57:06,202
Because of all our wrong doings.

336
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:09,171
With all the wrongs
that we try to make right.

337
00:57:11,017 --> 00:57:13,328
No matter how much we try
to correct what’s wrong.

338
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:19,218
I hope it’s not too late.

339
00:57:46,399 --> 00:57:47,441
Miss.

340
00:57:47,692 --> 00:57:48,734
Are you with someone?

341
00:57:49,735 --> 00:57:51,194
Can I sit with you?

342
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:18,704
Why are you alone?

343
00:58:19,844 --> 00:58:21,298
Where’s your boyfriend?

344
00:58:21,617 --> 00:58:22,617
Busy?

345
00:58:25,354 --> 00:58:27,064
I don’t have a boyfriend.

346
00:58:32,278 --> 00:58:33,738
Oh...

347
00:58:34,488 --> 00:58:35,488
Same.

348
00:58:49,144 --> 00:58:51,094
If you want, we could be together.

349
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:53,590
Promise.

350
00:58:53,841 --> 00:58:54,875
You’re the only one.

351
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:11,572
My new apartment is near.

352
00:59:11,968 --> 00:59:13,470
Do you want to see it?

353
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:20,446
You might teach me all
sorts of things again, huh?

354
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:29,502
Let’s go?
