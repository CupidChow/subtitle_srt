Sister, did you do something to make Su Yu angry?

I don't see pigs flying outside,

Sure,

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,670
you didn't make the female lead chase back the male lead,

14
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,750
but why did you make him work with that scumbag?

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,350
Don't tell me that it's a strategy in disguise.

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,190
He can still achieve his goal by working with the female lead.

I'm worried Dad will get suspicious if I ordered too much.

00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,470
do you want to take a look?

Don't ask me about such trivial matters,

Ever since what happened at the engagement banquet,

64
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,350
Su Yu hasn't visited sister's apartment.

65
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,810
I'm guessing they had a fight and aren't talking to each other.

66
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,140
How do you know Su Yu hasn't visited?

67
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,070
Since Xi's been contacting Su Yu about work lately,

68
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:56,210
she probably found out about his schedules.

69
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,410
Even though Su Yu

70
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,460
is continuing to work with us,

71
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,510
and continuing the engagement,

72
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,420
he just won't work with Chen.

73
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,200
Maybe he finds her unreliable.

Xi,

75
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,160
how can you say that about your sister?

76
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,470
I think Su Yu just wants to keep his professional and private life separate,

77
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,130
and doesn’t want to get his relationship involved with business.

78
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,380
That makes sense.

79
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,430
The more Su Yu is involved, the less he lets Chen interfere

80
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,860
in case their relationship affects the business,

81
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,330

00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,870
also catch up?

161
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,500
We just started working together,

162
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,810
so we still have a lot of things to deal with,

163
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,810
I think we should take it slow first.

164

However, there's one thing I need to let you guys know.

don't let it affect the company's business.

Of course.

189
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,490
You will never get rid of me.

190
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,800
Never.

191
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,350
Never!

192
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,180
What's wrong?

193
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,150
My phone.

194
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:57,890
Don't move.

195
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,050
Where am I?

196
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,530
Why am I at the hospital again?

197
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,310
Anaphylaxis.

198
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,440
The doctor did a blood test already.

199
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,170
You're allergic to mushrooms.

200
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,060
Mushrooms?

201
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,190
Don't you know

202
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,160
what you're allergic to?

203
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,690
I didn't eat any mushrooms.

204
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,890
The doctor said it was treated in time,

205
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,880
so there won't be any problems.

206
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,390
Did you bring me here?

207
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,210
This is the test report.

208

If you don't need anything,

209
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,230

Don't think too much,

212
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,850
I just followed my instincts.

00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,040

Boss, this is the tonic soup you asked the Chef to make.

247
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,760
I asked him to add many tonics

How is Mochen?

253

She still has a fever

254
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,800
but the doctor said she can be discharged in two days.

255
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,760
What's the problem?

256
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,970
An allergy to mushrooms.

257

Mushrooms?

258
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,370
There's no mushrooms in the menu.

259
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,070
Yeah,

260
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,690
the Chef can prove it.

261
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,420
The problem may not be the dishes,

262
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,180
but the wine.

263
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,150
I checked the wine list,

264
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,480
and noticed the wine contains mushrooms.

265
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,410
How can there be mushrooms in wine?

266
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,790
Wine is made of grapes.

267
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,450
Yeah,

268
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:32,000
I've never heard that there are mushrooms in wine.

269
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:32,590
Exactly.

00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,870
this is all Mom's fault.

272
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,120
I should have checked it properly.

273

Look at what happened.

274
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,550
Mom, it's not your fault.

275
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,120
Sister didn't notice it herself.

276
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,720
It's fine.

277
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,330
Luckily, she was rescued in time

278

Don't think too much,

291

292

295

Then yesterday, during dinner,

296
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,900
when you saw Ye Yunkai touch me like that,

297
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,590
why didn't you do anything?

298
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,860
Why should I care?

299
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,200
Haven't you always been like this with him?

300
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,970
But you could tell that I didn't like it.

301
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,830
How would I know that you weren't just acting again?

302
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,070

I asked someone to make this soup for you.

305
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,070
It got delivered here not too long ago,

306
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,130

There must be something

376
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,700
between Su Yu and Ye Yunkai that I don't know about.

377
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:49,960
Song Yu,

378
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,320
what are you doing?

379
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,900
Boss,

380
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,150
did you stay up all night?

381
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:00,070
I want to finish these samples as soon as possible.

382
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,030
The design style of these products

383
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,360
are very similar to your early projects.

384
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,050
Something about it feels different though.

385
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,360
What's different?

386
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,800
I think there's an extra hint of softness.

387
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,940
It perfectly balances out

388
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,070
with your early designs.

00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,540
These works

390
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:30,680
are very memorable to me.

391
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:32,880
I can't believe such a perfect work

392
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,450
will be collaborating with a low-end brand like Chenyun.

393
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:38,010
That Ye Yunkai looks like a New Money,

394
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,580
he knows nothing about art.

395
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,080

396
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,270
Mr. Ye,

397
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,570
following your request, the Purchase Department

398
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,430
has purchased enough materials.

399
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,750
The production line is also ready.

400
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,750
As long as S&YU provides the drafts and samples,

401
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,930
we can start production immediately.

402
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,220
But, Mr. Ye,

403
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,350
since we greatly expanded our production line,

404
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,700
and stored up on many materials,

405
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,670
our funds are quite tight.

406
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,890
Will there be any problems?

407
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,340
What problem could there be?

408
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,870
In my opinion, the scale isn't even big enough yet.

409
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:23,110
I already applied for a loan and it'll be approved soon,

410
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,510
so be ready to receive it.

411
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,270
But...

412
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,110
But what?

413
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,550
Have you seen the preorder data?

414
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,720
There are so many consumers who are willing to buy it.

415
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,580
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us.

416
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,030
If we succeed,

417
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,320
we will not only make a fortune,

418
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,430
but can also become a top brand.

Ms. Ning, look,

428
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,800
this is Mr. Su’s latest design.

429
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,750

yet completely different at the same time.

431
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:18,300
There seems to be an extra touch of a soft and feminine style.
