from your position as the president immediately.

00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:15,470
You...

00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,310
are done for.

00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,670
Are you crazy?

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,670
What did the Ning family do to you?

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,920
Did you do all this for your benefit?

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,480
Why are you doing this to me?

10
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,990
I'm your medicine.

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,500
Why look for me for such a trivial matter?

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,830
What did I raise you for?

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,160
Hello, Song Yu.

14
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,030
Investigate someone for me.

15
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,270
A brocade banner?

16
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,350
For whom?

17
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,710
A gift from our fans.

18
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,270
That's a good thing, sir.

19
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,300

Yes.

22
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,070
Such a genius editor,

23
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,640
great ideas.

24
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:04,510

Dumb ass storyline.

00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,170
Gives me high blood pressure.

From the second female lead's fans.

28
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,600
The second female lead's fans are sending us blades.

Sir.

32
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,510
I won't let you and the audience down in the next chapter.

36
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:13,830
Boss,

37
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,829
the lady you asked me to investigate who splashed water

38
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,470
at Ms. Ning on Ning Zhaoxiong's 60th birthday is called Zhao Si.

39
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,550
She's the sister of Ms. Ning's ex

40
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,670
who allegedly passed on after she abandoned him.

41
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,120
She was also the first person who released the news online.

42
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,520
Zhao Lin died of illness.

43
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,480
Zhao Si blamed all of this

44
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,630
on Ms. Ning.

45
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,440
According to what she said,

46
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,630
it was Ms. Bai Li who looked for her.

47
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,510
The follow-up scandals about Ms. Ning

48
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,310
were also provided by Ms. Bai Li.

49
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:45,440
She also arranged those photos taken at the hotel, and venue setting,

50
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,040
under the order of Ms. Bai Li.

51
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,550
Anything else?

52
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,880
Zhao Si is also mentally ill.

53
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,470
She's Dr. Peng Yu's patient.

54
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,240
She had counseling with him.

55
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,870
All the people related to this

56
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,360
are all his patients.

57
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,040
Yes.

58
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,150
There's something more interesting.

59
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,510
Ms. Bai and Yang Group's young master Yang Guang

60
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,140
set up a fund recruitment company

61
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,150
named BY Group.

62
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,470
The 55% shares that Ningmei holds now

63
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,400
was what forced Ning Zhaoxiong

64
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,350
to pass the CEO position to Ms. Bai

65
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,670
at the board meeting.

66
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,390
Bai Li went to the company

67
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,870
and forced Ning Zhaoxiong to quit.

68
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,470
Yes.

69
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,510
There were many people there.

70
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,310
Ms. Bai lashed out on Ning Zhaoxiong.

71
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,520
She's not simple.

72
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,520
She's smart and ruthless.

73
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,270
Boss, are you okay?

74
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,990
What should we do next?

75
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,650
To Ningmei.

76
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,890
Give me the pen.

77
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,030
Ms. Bai,

78
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,730
please take a closer look.

79
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,010
Especially Article 6.

80
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,750
You need to confirm it yourself.

81
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,110
We don't dare to decide it.

82
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,570
You are the legal counsel.

83
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,270
I paid you

84
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,870
to do nothing?

85
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,590
Why didn't you edit the contract before passing it to me?

86
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,490
Ms. Bai,

87
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,390
I've negotiated this contract with the other party for three rounds.

88
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,560
This is the result after we compromised.

89
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,400
However,

90
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,230
Article 6, regarding the rights for the follow-up development of derivatives,

91
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,950
-are to be–
-It's theirs. It's settled then.

92
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,150
We can't do that, Ms. Bai.

93
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,990
10% of our performance

94
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,450
is based on the development of derivatives.

95
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,280
10%?

96
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,180
That's not much.

97
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,260
Ms. Bai,

98
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,720
I think you were too busy to take a look.

99
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,110
Our cooperation

100
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,750
would takes three years to improve our performance.

101
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,870
But the loss of 10%

102
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,520
will easily cause a huge loss to this year's financial report.

103
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,780
So you don't understand what I'm saying?

104
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,870
Either I sign it,

105
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,530
or get lost.

106
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,460
Ms. Bai,

107
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,190
we'll leave first.

108
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,310
Get lost!

109
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,510
Let's go.

110
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,950
Signing the contract

111
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,700
is just a process.

112
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,540
The most important thing in cooperation

113
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,540
is the early stages of negotiation.

114
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,120
Su Yu, why are you here?

115
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,010
Bai Li,

116
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,360
you've never handled these things yourself.

117
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,090
Don't worry.

118
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,480
You can learn it slowly.

119
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,510
As you know,

120
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,110
Ye Yunkai didn't allow me to interfere in the company's operation.

121
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,110
Actually, sometimes I'm a little bit naive.

122
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,310
But you don't seem naive

123
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,060
from what you did previously.

124
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,520
What do you mean?

125
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,040
On May 21, you first came to Ningmei

126
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,070
to negotiate with Ning Zhaoxiong.

127
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,110
On May 29,

128
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,370
all the scandals about Ning Mochen were spread online.

129
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,200
Then,

130
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,360
all the scandals were exposed at Ning Zhaoxiong's birthday banquet.

131
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,760
Ningmei's stocks also plummeted that day.

132
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,100
On June 1,

133
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,030
you and Yang Guang started BY Capital and started acquiring stocks crazily,

134
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,290
buying all the Ningmei stocks in the market at a high price.

135
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,910
Although the purchase price is much higher than the market price,

136
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,770
due to the decrease a few days ago,

137
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,450
the stock price is at its historical lowest.

138
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,850
And then?

139
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,950
On June 3rd,

140
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,870
you forced Ning Zhaoxiong to resign at the board meeting

141
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,600
and gained control of Ningmei.

142
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,310
Weren't you behind all this?

143
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,510
You investigated me?

144
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,270
Bai Li.

145
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,470
Why did you do that?

146
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,150
I told you

147
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,470
Ning Mochen forced me to do this.

148
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,320
Even if Ning Mochen forced you,

149
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,950
you just recovered

150
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,230
you just recovered and lost your memory.

151
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,830
You wouldn't have done that.

152
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,220
What are you trying to tell me?

153
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,070
Why did you pretend to have amnesia?

154
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,510
Why did you frame her?

155
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,830
I framed her?

156
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,350
Ning Mochen deserves it.

157
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,440
None of the exposes are fake.

158
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,330
You should know

159
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,060
what she did to me.

160
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,950
She ruined my family

161
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,040
and my life.

162
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,160
How can I let her go so easily?

163
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,400
Of course I want her to lose everything.

164
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,250
I wanted to let her feel

165
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,420
the feeling of being isolated.

166
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,150
Now I did it.

167
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,159
Shouldn't you be happy for me?

168
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,190
Bai Li.

169
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,150
How did you become like this?

170
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,090
The Bai Li I knew before

171
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,690
wouldn't be so cruel.

172
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,480
Do you know how many innocent people

173
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,320
you will affect by manipulating the stocks?

174
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,380
So good people should be suppressed?

175
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,100
If I'm bullied, shouldn't I fight back?

176
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,060
You always wanted to uphold justice for me.

177
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,790
Actually, we have the same goal.

178
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,830
The Bai Li I know

179
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,390
won't use others,

180
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,790
much less me.

181
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,810
I used you?

182
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,660
What have you done for me?

183
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:07,930
Your soul

184
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,960
has been seduced by Ning Mochen.

185
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,120
What about Ningmei?

186
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,110
Have you ever thought about running it well?

187
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,950
You snatched it

188
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,320

192

Aren't you an outsider?

Don't you know how to read the room?

Stop sleeping and get up.

210

So ugly.

216
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,030
Why did you do that?

217
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,070
Shouldn't ugly things

218

But you designed that cup personally

221
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,880
and made it for me as a birthday present.

222

But that doesn't change the fact

223
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,130

I don't know what's wrong with you.

You've changed since you came out of the hospital.

227
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,280
You became selfish, indifferent,

253
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,050
There's no love in the way she looks at Mr. Su.

254
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,870

00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,960
but you still came to me.

378
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,670
No matter who you are,

379
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,800
or how rich you are,

380
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,370
you are a scum.

381
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,680
Do you think you deserve Ning Mochen?

382
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,370
So funny.

383
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,590
You're just a loser who relies on women at the end of the day!

384
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,070
I...

385
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,650
I don't hit women.

386
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,780
But don't think I can do nothing to you.

387
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,390
Bai Li, remember,

388
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,850
I am the actual person controlling Ningmei.

389
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,290
If I can take you to that position,

390
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,880
means I can also make you fall from that position.

391
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:51,010
Let's see if you kick me down first

392
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,200
or I get to Yang family first.

393
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,430
See yourself out,

394
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,140
Mr. Song.

395
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:37,910
Bai Li...

396
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:35,640
[Tan's Silverware]

397
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,990
[Tan's Silverware]

398
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:48,220
This kind of old-fashioned silverware shop is rare.

399
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,390
If Su Yu were here,

400
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,560
he'd be interested.

401
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,390
This is...

402
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,240
the ancient technique of embedding silver threads?

403
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,100
You know it too?

404
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,710
I learned it in school.

405
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,200
But I've never tried it myself.

406
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,880
Is that so?

407
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,390
Do you want to try?

408
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,110
Sure.

409
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,990
I'll buy it if I spoil it.

410
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,710
It's fine.

411
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:19,120
If I hadn't inherited this shop,

412
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,840
I wouldn't be able to learn such good ancient skills.

413
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,030
Come, sit down.

414
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,010
I'll teach you.

415
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,710
Thank you, Ma'am.

416
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,990
Just call me Tan.

417
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,790
Ning Mochen.

418
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,350
Why would she make silverware?

419
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,970
Her posture and techniques

420
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:52,690
look familiar.

421
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,060
You're back.

422
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,680
How did it go with Bai Li?

423
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,010
I was sold this ring

424
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,720
for a thousand yuan.

425
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,920
Was I scammed?

426
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,510
This ring...

427
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,370
The workmanship is indeed rough.

428
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,870
The parts they welded didn't join perfectly either.

429
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,190
Look carefully.

430
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,980
That is a design.

431
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,350
Madam.

432
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,070
It's you again.

433
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,120
My friend was rude before.

434
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,780
I apologize on her behalf.

435
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,150
I would like to buy something.

436
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,130
What is it?

437
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:50,200
The ring you made with that lady just now.

438
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,090
I'm sorry. I won't sell it.

439
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,270
Why?

440
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,710
Because I really like that lady.

441
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,840
I don't want to sell something she made

442
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,660
to someone I don't like.

443
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,210
If I can tell you

444
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,070
the meaning of this ring,

445
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,980
will you sell it to me?

446
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,790
It depends on what you say.

447
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,400
If you say something good,

448
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,770
I'll sell it to you.

449
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,750
The meaning of this ring is

450
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,270
a meeting at a crossroad.

451
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,480
The designer's concept is

452
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:26,070
the two parallel lines that originally wouldn't interact

453
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,860
meet by chance in a passing moment,

454
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,760
But having a different destination.

455
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,790
The further they go,

456
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,960
the two of them will only go further apart.

457
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,390
That's what it is.

458
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,750
It sounds

459
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,410
quite pessimistic.

460
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,980
Not pessimistic.

461
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,070
Maybe

462
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,210
the creator wants to express that

463
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,810
destiny is unpredictable.

00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,590

listen to me.

491
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,230
Hearing you speak

492
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,510
makes me sick.

493
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,670
Ning Mochen, let me say it again.

494
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,010
This is a fake engagement.

495
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,030
It's her.

496
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,090
She seduced my husband.

497
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,590
Stop talking nonsense!

498
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,990
You called Su Yu here, didn’t you?

499
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:24,790
You deliberately provoked me

500
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,990
just to act in front of him, right?

501
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,580
Enough!

502
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,790
She wants to take this opportunity

503
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,270
to drag all of us down.

504
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,590
She's not Bai Li.

505
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,070
She's a lunatic.

506
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,070

Yes.

00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,790

you woke up in Ning Mochen's body

524
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,060
and Ning Mochen

525
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,510
in yours?

526
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:31,990
Bai Li,

527
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,800
why didn't you tell me?

528
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,660
I don't know why

529
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,990
but every time when I want to tell the truth,

530
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,110
I feel dizzy,

531
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,870
my heart races,

532
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,390
and I even go into shock.

533
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,850
What about now?

534
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,680
How come nothing happened?

535
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,400
Maybe it's because

536
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,360
you already recognized me.

537
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,150
How could this happen?

538
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,100
Do you remember

539
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,330
my 10th wedding anniversary?

540
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,140
It should be that accident.

541
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,920
Everything makes sense now.

542
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:33,180
Ning Mocheng used her own scoops

543
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,980
to affect Ningmei's stock price,

544
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,760
and then took the chance to acquire it,

545
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,100
and forced Ning Zhaoxiong to resign.

546
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,620
She then used your body to create discord between the two of us.

547
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,380
Ning Mochen used my body

548
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,160
to get what she wanted,

549
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,250
but she never thought

550
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,750
that there would be

551
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,290
telepathy.

552
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,180
I always believed

553
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,510
you will find me.

554
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,810
I'm sorry, Bai Li.

555
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,100
You reminded me a long time ago

556
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,460
but I just realized.

557
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,710
This is something unbelievable to start with anyway.

558
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,510
It's normal that you don't know.

559
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,630
It's a miracle that you can

560
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,830
recognize me now.

561
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,300
You've suffered.

562
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,250
After I woke up,

563
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,120
I've been thinking about revenge

564
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,570
and focused on playing Ning Mochen.

565
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:33,340
But after so many things, I realized

566
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:35,520
that

567
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,070
revenge doesn't make me happy.

568
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:44,270
Instead, it drags me into the abyss of pain.

569
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,240
Bai Li...

570
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,680
After everything is settled,

571
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,000
I thought

572
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,350
to go back to my life.

573
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,870
But I didn’t expect

574
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,930
Ning Mochen suddenly woke up.

575
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:02,670
She even used my identity to use your feelings.

576
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:05,460
I don't know what else she will do.

577
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,830
I'm really scared.

578
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,590
Don't worry.

579
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,790
I finally found you.

580
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,950
I won't let anyone hurt you

581
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,310
and get in our way.

582
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,040
"Our"?

583
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,110
Yes.

584
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:25,920
Yes.

585
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,130
"Our."

586
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:49,560
Why are you looking at me like that?

587
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,200
Nothing.

588
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,760
I'm just not used to it.

589
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,440
Not used to Bai Li's soul

590
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,750
being in Ning Mochen's body?

591
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,230
I wasn't used to it at first.

592
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,510
I even wondered if I was crazy.

593
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,550
It took me a long time

594
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,150
to get used to this body.

595
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,600
Now that I think about it,

596
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,020
at that time,

597
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,660
I should have recognized you right away.

598
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,480
But I was too stupid.

599
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,070
Sorry, Su Yu.

600
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,830
I used Ning Mochen’s body to work with you.

601
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,420
I used you

602
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,560
to get revenge on Ye Yunkai.

603
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:35,890
No, Bai Li.

604
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,300
I'm the one who should apologize.

605
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,170
I should have recognized you from the beginning.

606
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,690
I thought of you as Ning Mochen

607
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,370
and got angry at you.

608
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,390
That was when you were the weakest.

609
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,490
You must've felt helpless.

610
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:52,830
I'm sorry.

611
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:56,190
You didn't know who I was back then.

612
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,880
And that's also why

613
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,800
I can find out about your feelings towards me.

614
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,360
Thank you, Su Yu.

615
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:13,430
Now that I think about it,

616
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:16,170
if it hadn't happened,

617
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,710
I might still be the Bai Li who

618
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,100
hides in a lie and can't find myself.

619
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:24,450
Thank you for helping me find myself.

620
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:27,390
Let's go.

621
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,360
Where did you go at that time?

622
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,190
-Why didn’t you tell me?
-I went to find you.

623
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,180
If you told me, there wouldn't be so much trouble.
