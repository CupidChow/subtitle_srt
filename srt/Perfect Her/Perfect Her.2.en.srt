Thank you, honey.

Ms. Ning Mochen.

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,250
On the day they fall into the lake,

5
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,510
the world is drenched with torrential rain.

At this critical moment...

They both manage to survive.

The main female character is reincarnated.

9
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,710
She then triumphs over her enemies and finally changes her life, right?

10
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,270
Yeah.

11
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,670
I can always predict how this kind of story ends

12
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,100
when I read the beginning of it.

13
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,350
Didn't you tell me to write an exciting and dramatic story

14
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,510
where the main female character takes revenge?

15
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,070
You also said the first few scenes had to be eye-catching,

16
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,039
and appealing to the readers

17
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:09,390
so as to captivate their attention, right?

18
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,990
Then where is the creative element I asked for?

19
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,789
Where's the dramatic part?

20
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:16,640
There has to be slumps before a rousing climax.

21
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,910
Rising from the lowest point brings the most joy.

22
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,870
Ms. Ai, I'm not being harsh here,

23
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,430
but I just hope the beginning of the story

24
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,910
contains all the elements I've asked for.

25
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,710
I hope the readers can grasp the gist

26
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,310
of this story at first sight.

27
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,950
If I add every element you want into the story,

28
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,990
it'll only end up a huge mess

29
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,520
that repulses the readers.

30
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:37,240
But the project will be canceled if what you draw falls below expectations.

31
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,680
Fine. I'll add a big twist to it right away.

Isn't she Ning Mochen, who was brought here yesterday after drowning?

36
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,720
I heard that a female patient named Bai Li

37
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,190
fell into water at the same time as her.

Was my body switched with Ning Mochen's

I know what you're thinking.

52
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,470
The fact that I'm in Bai Li's ward instead of yours

53
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,800
has made you mad, right?

Whenever I try to say who I really am,

I would feel dizzy as if my soul is being pulled away.

122

Is there something unusual

that keeps me from revealing my real identity?

124
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,970
Is it related to Bai Li who is unconscious in bed now?

Ning Mochen and I fell into the same pool of water

00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,750
happened to us in the water

141
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,660
and caused this trouble?

142
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,830
So this is Ning Mochen's home?

Su Yu, I’m a little tired today.

150
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,590
I want to be alone.

151
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,030
You should go and take a rest.

152

156

Are you trying to mess up everything?

Have you forgotten that we might be heard?

162
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,470
What?

163
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,220
Are you pretending to have lost your memories?

What devious plan are you hatching now?

165
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,570
Are you doing this to me

166
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:54,430
because of my relationship with Ye Yunkai?

167
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,180
Ning Mochen, I'm gonna say this again.

168
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,830
We simply faked our engagement.

169
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,560
I don't care if you're involved with another man.

170
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,290
But you really shouldn't have hurt Bai Li.

171
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,230
A fake engagement?

172
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,590
Let me ask you something.

173
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,390
Did you investigate me,

174
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,120
and destroy Bai Li's family on purpose?

175
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,600
I don't know.

176
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,330
I really don't know anything.

177
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,750
Are you leaving?

178
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,950
Yes, I am!

179
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:36,210
I can't bear to be in the same room as you for another second!

180
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,200
But I promised your parents

181
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,460
to stay here and take care of you tonight.

182
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,420
I'll sleep in the next room.

183
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,850
What is going on with Su Yu?

184
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,230
Why would he become

185
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,010
completely different all of a sudden?

186
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,430
My soul is in Ning Mochen's body now.

187
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,110
Is Su Yu somehow forced to stick with Ning Mochen?

188
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,650
You have a fiance.

189
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,480
Why do you have to do this?

190
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,280
Are you seeking thrills?

191
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,160
Thrills?

192
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,340
It is thrilling.

193
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,950
Ye Yunkai keeps saying

194
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,440
how beautiful and tender his wife is.

195
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,830
I would love to see what happens

196
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,960
when a woman like you is driven mad.

197
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,540
It must be fun, right?

198
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,250
How do you like my face?

199
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,350
Your husband loves it very much.

200
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,270
Why?

201
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,110
Why must my soul be in Ning Mochen's body?

202
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,610
I have to figure out what made this happen.

203
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,170
Mochen, good morning.

204
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,160
Come have breakfast.

205
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:49,330
Come on.

206
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,650
Dig in.

207
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,990
What's the matter with Su Yu?

208
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,920
Why is his attitude all different again?

209
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,510
There must be a secret

210
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,710
between him and Ning Mochen.

211
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,630
It seems like Su Yu is not just attracted to Ning Mochen's pretty looks.

212
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,550
About Bai Li...

213
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,590
How is she doing?

214
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,800
Has she woken up yet?

215
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,900
Wipe those crocodile tears of yours.

216
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,810
Then I guess she is still in a coma.

217
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,670
I'd like to pay her a visit.

218
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,500
You have just gotten well.

219
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,830
You should stay home and rest.

220
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,620
I'm fine.

221
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,910
I'm more worried about her.

222
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,870
I already said no.

223
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,400
Her husband is with her now.

224
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,060
We shouldn't disturb her.

225
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,540
That's exactly why I need to visit her.

226
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,790
Look, there's food all over your mouth.

227
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,800
Ning Mochen,

228
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,660
I'm warning you,

229
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,830
stay away from Bai Li.

230
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:34,270
Eat up.

231
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,450
I know you hate it when I approach Bai Li.

232
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,940
However,

233
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,220
I insist on visiting her.

234
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,400
Okay.

235
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,710
I’ll go with you then.

236
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:06,990
Su Yu,

237
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,569
well...

238
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,430
How much do you know about

239
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,480
my relationship with Ye Yunkai?

240
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,420
How long have I been with him?

241
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,640
You told me about it, remember?

242
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,140
I know nothing about you,

243
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,609
and I'm not interested at all.

244
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:27,430
So it's news to you too.

245
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,640
How long have we been engaged?

246
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,520
Ning Mochen, what are you trying to say?

247
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,420
My head got a bit fuzzy after I woke up.

248
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,170
There are many things I can't recall now.

249
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,400
We got engaged a month ago.

250
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,480
Ning Mochen,

251
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,710
I don't care how you dally with men outside.

252
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,390
We're just cooperating with each other.

253
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,980
We aren't supposed to interfere with each other's personal life.

254
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,870
After we reach our respective goals,

255
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,000
we'll stop doing what we're doing now.

256
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,720
But don't you forget

257
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,360
that if anything happens to Bai Li,

258
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,150
I'll hold you accountable.

259
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,430
She will wake up.

260
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,280
She will.

261
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,690
You'd better pray for that.

262
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,550
Su Yu,

263
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,310
isn't Bai Li a schoolmate of yours?

264
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,150
Why didn't you contact her in the past few years?

265
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,480
Why didn't you tell her about your return and engagement?

266
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,030
I didn't see a reason to contact her.

267
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,750
The woman lying in bed

268
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,050
is my wife who I've been with for years.

269
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,890
Let's wait and see what happens.

270
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,760
My wife is the love of my life.

271
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,420
This accident

272
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,440
got her into a vegetative state.

273
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,130
I have no idea when she will come to.

274
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,010
All the products of Chenyun Jewelry

275
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,730
were designed by me and her together.

276
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,250
A lot of people have told me to give up,

277
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:27,590
saying

278
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,450
that it is meaningless

279
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,380
to stay with someone who might never wake up.

280
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,100
But,

281
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,940
however hard my life gets,

282
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,200
or even if I have to spend every penny I own,

283
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,150
I will never give up on my wife.

284
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:44,910
Honey,

285
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,990
many people like our designs.

286
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,830
Our rings have contributed to

287
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,340
some successful marriage proposals.

288
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,540
We are also the reason

289
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,160
for some people to believe in true love.

290
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,030
Honey,

291
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,140
can you please wake up?

292
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,190
Lots of people are waiting for us

293
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:06,070
to design jewelry for them.

294
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,820
What are you doing?

295
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,590
You wanna help Ye Yunkai rub salt in Bai Li's wound?

296
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,710
Su Yu,

297
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,190
believe it or not,

298
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,700
I'm as angry as you are.

299
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,010
Knock it off, hypocrite.

300
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,560
Why are you angry?

301
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,270
Is this eating at your conscience? Are you feeling remorse?

302
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,930
Do you even have those things?

Mr. Su,

305
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,140
when did you arrive?

306
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,410
Thank you for visiting Bai Li.

307
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,130
I don't know when she will wake up.

308
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,160
I've heard a lot about you from Bai Li.

309
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,710
It's a shame that I couldn't have a longer talk with you in the ceremony.

310
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,970
Actually, I've always liked your works.

311
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,530
I hope there will be an opportunity to work with you.

312
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,050
I believe if Bai Li were awake,

313
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,230
she would love to see us designing jewelry together.

314
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,890
I'm here to visit Bai Li today.

315
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,500
I don't want to talk about other things.

316
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,390
Okay.

317
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,790
Well, I'll leave you to it.

318
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,860
Ms. Ning,

319
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,110
can I have a word with you?

320
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:17,770
Stop it.

321
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:18,840
Drop the act.

322
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,560
Su Yu can’t see us now.

323
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,790
What act?

324
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,490
If it weren't for the purpose of impressing Su Yu,

325
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,380
why would you ever come to visit Bai Li?

326
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,610
You keep surprising me, Chen.

327
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,140
You can be innocent and seductive,

328
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,300
aloof and sweet.

329
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,110
What is wrong?

330
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,830
Are you jealous?

331
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,630
Don't think too much.

332
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,490
I invited that reporter over.

333
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,360
I said those things only to sell more jewelry.

334
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,390
Ye Yunkai,

335
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:59,180
you're milking Bai Li's misfortune.

336
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,280
You're inhuman.

337
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,140
So I'm inhuman?

338
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,150
What's the purpose of your visit then?

339
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,450
You can put up a show but I can't?

340
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,520
At least I've admitted it was an act.

341
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,380
What about you?

342
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:18,170
Have you gotten so used to acting that you can't get back to real life?

343
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,770
Chen, I know what is going on.

344
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,680
Recently, because of Su Yu,

345
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,990
you've started to feel differently about me.

346
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,580
But soon I will prove to you

347
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,110
that I’m better than Su Yu.

Aren't you gonna ask what the surprise is?

353
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,310
in the past ten years,

354
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,400
I refrained from contacting you,

355
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,030
because I knew you were having a good life,

356
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,430
and I didn't want to disturb you.

I hope you'll take good care of Bai Li.

372
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,390
If anything happens to her,

00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,810

Sure.

376
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,070
She is my wife.

377
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,150
Why wouldn't I take good care of her?

378
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,460
I'm going to my company.

379
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,320

[S&YU Jewelry Design Corporation]

384
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:55,990
Hello, Mr. Su.

385
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,110
Boss,

386
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,870
why would you come back to work today?

387
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,710
Anything wrong?

388
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:00,510
Hello, Mr. Su.

389
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,350
I heard Ms. Ning had an accident.

390
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,070
Is she okay?

391
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,330
All alive and kicking.

392
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,660
Great. I'm glad she's fine.

393

When I heard the news,

394
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,990
I was shocked.

395
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,390
Ms. Ning is so lucky.

396
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:17,560
Boss, when will we start

397
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,590
cooperating with Ningmei Jewelry?

398
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,640
It is not the right time yet.

399
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,050
Ningmei Jewelry is a time-honored brand in the country,

400
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,820
but they're already lagging behind in designs and silver jewelry production.

401
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,120
In contrast, we're running a thriving, fashionable

402
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,670
and popular brand of silver jewelry.

403
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:35,520
We're just seeking a larger platform that can help us further develop.

404
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,450
If we partner with Ningmei Jewelry,

405
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,480
we'll both benefit.

406
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,360
But, Boss,

407
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,710
it is true love that has brought you and Ms. Ning together.

408
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,230
It has nothing to do with business.

409
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,790
You are a perfect match.

410
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,280
By the way, when is your wedding?

411
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,040

Hello.

00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,630
Ms. Ning,

416
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,230
you finally answered my call.

417
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:33,360
You made an appointment for today. Are you still coming?

418
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,230
What is it about?

419
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,750
I'm Peng Yu,

420
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,270
your therapist.

421
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:44,270
Oh.

422
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:45,870
Today is not good for me.

423
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:46,930
Let's postpone it.

424
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,870
I gave a call to Ning Mochen,

425
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,730
and she was so polite on the phone.

426
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,310
When I asked her to come home for dinner,

427
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,770
she even said "thank you."

428
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,910
Everything is odd.

429
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,580
First, she suddenly hooked up with Su Yu.

430
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,710
Then, she had a serious accident,

431
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,650
but she managed to stay unscathed.

432
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,110
I guess she was just lucky.

433
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,820
Anyway,

434
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:18,400
the cooperation with Su Yu means a lot to your father now.

435
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,530
Mochen has become Su Yu's fiancee.

436
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,640
For the time being, we'd better be kind to her.

437
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,130
The woman on the left

438
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:30,010
must be Ning Zhaoxiong's third wife, Chen Ling.

439
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,970
The girl on the right

440
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:33,710
must be Ning Moxi, the daughter

441
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,840
of Ning Zhaoxiong and his second wife.

442
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,710
What a complicated family!

443
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,970
Chen, you're back!

444
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,160
Chen,

445
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,210
welcome home.

446
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,550
Hi, Sis.

447
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,900
Mom.

448
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,070
What did you call me?

449
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,360
This has never happened before.

450
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:58,990
What's wrong?

451
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:01,410
I'm not used to hearing you say "Sis" and "Mom."

452
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,960
Maybe you should get back to calling us by our names.

453
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,640
It sounds creepy when you call us in that chummy way.

454
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,760
Xi,

455
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:10,330
how could you talk to your sister like that?

456
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,950
Mochen is your older sister.

457
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:12,980
You two are related by blood.

458
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,360
I'm so happy that she calls me "Mom."

459
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,850
Come on, Chen.

460
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,880
Let’s sit on the couch.

461
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,150
Did Su Yu drive you home?

462
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,870
No, I came here myself.

463
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,590
He's your fiance,

464
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,810
and you just had an accident.

465
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,480
Why didn’t he drive you home?

466
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,390
Chen, you and Su Yu are engaged now.

467
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,010
You might as well marry him soon.

468
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,500
Have you two decided when to tie the knot?

469
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,590
We're not sure yet.

470
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,150
Let's go downstairs.

471
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,630
Your dad is there waiting for us.

472
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,160
Let's go.

473
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,230
Come on.

474
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:16,150
Zhaoxiong, Chen is here.

475
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:17,590
Come on.

476
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:23,470
Sit.

477
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,540

00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,350
Huh?

479
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,120
Oh.

480
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,790
I'm fine now.

481
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:36,910
Why didn't you

482
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,270
call us when you were discharged from the hospital?

483
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,590
Hey, Zhaoxiong,

484
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,800
you know Chen loves to have fun.

485
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,070
At least she is back now, right?

486
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,070
She has a fiance now.

487
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,550
It's time to settle down.

488
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,790
Listen,

489
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:53,310
you're perfectly aware of Ningmei Jewelry's current situation.

490
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,640
It's being threatened by many new brands.

491
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:58,110
We're in urgent need of a creative

492
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,840
and famous designer like Su Yu.

493
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,390
I hope you can make good use of your relationship with him.

494
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,130
Don't mess it up. Got it?

495
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,010
Chen, your dad is talking to you.

496
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:17,330
Dad, I think Chen has tried her best.

497
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,630
You'd hate for your daughter

498
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,950
to lose her dignity, right?

499
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,840
Mr. Ning, Ye Yunkai is here for a visit.

500
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,470
Can I go with you?

501
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,430
Mr. Ning.

502
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,830
There you are, Ye.

503
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,160
Ms. Ning.

504
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,090
Come on. Have a seat.

505
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,830
Ye,

506
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,280
it's late at night. What are you here for?

507
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:05,310
When Ms. Ning attended my wife and my

508
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,590
10th wedding anniversary celebration,

509
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,990
she got into an accident.

510
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,950
I feel terribly sorry for that.

511
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,760
This is why I'm here for a visit.

512
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:14,920
Is that all?

513
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,560
Mr. Ning, during this visit,

514
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,160
I'd also like to discuss

515
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,130
future cooperation with you.

516
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:25,870
Go on.

517
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:31,310
You see, since I received media interviews,

518
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,110
more attention has been drawn to me and my wife.

519
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:36,920
As a result, the sales and popularity of Chenyun Jewelry

520
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,470
have reached a new level.

521
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:39,830
I think

522
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:44,250
we can be a great partner for Ningmei Jewelry now that we're in a better position.

523
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,320
Look,

524
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,230
Ye,

525
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,260
your products are fast moving consumer goods.

526
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,800
I think Ningmei Jewelry deserves a better qualified partner.

527
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,930
It's true that you've received media interviews

528
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,560
where you talk about love stories.

529
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,670
It seems like a great publicity campaign,

530
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:04,780
but I'm not sure

531
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:07,090
how much good it will do to your brand.

532
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,670
Listen,

533
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,590
Mr. Ning,

534
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,340
today I came here also to tell you

535
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,150
that an inheritor of intangible cultural heritage,

536
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,550
namely the master of jade carving Mr. Feng,

537
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,050
is going to be our strategic partner.

538
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:27,680
By then, Chenyun Jewelry's brand image will be totally different.

539
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,360
Mr. Feng has just won an award.

540
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,270
He has now been thrust into the limelight.

541
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,270
Besides, he is a very eccentric man.

542
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:36,280
He has refused many big companies' invitations.

543
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,150
Ye, are you sure you can persuade him?

544
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,950
Although it is difficult,

545
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,740
I'll still try my best to make it come true.

546
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,410
Well, when you make that happen,

547
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,010
we'll talk again.

548
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,150
Okay.

549
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,780
I should get going.

550
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,000
Let me show you out, Mr. Ye.

551
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:09,800
What do you think, Chen?

552
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,370
This is the surprise I told you about.

553
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,260
How did you get to know Mr. Feng?

554
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,340
Mr. Feng and Bai Li are close friends.

555
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,900
Bai Li is sick in bed now,

556
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,050
and I'm taking good care of her.

557
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,150
Mr. Feng has been deeply moved,

558
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:27,270
saying that I can ask him for help if I'm in need.

559
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,489
As I told you before,

560
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,480
I'll be more successful than Su Yu.

561
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:40,150
You and I can help each other too.

562
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,230
You're not only using Bai Li,

563
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,550
but also taking advantage of her friend

564
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,550
in her name.

565
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,040
How many more shameful things are you capable of?

566
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,110
Shameful?

567
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,620
There is no limit to what I can do for you.

568
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,540
What?

569
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,710
Are you still not satisfied?

570
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,210
You are really going to leave me for Su Yu.

571
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,750
Am I just a piece of worthless trash to you?

572
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,990
Why would Su Yu get together with you?

573
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,830
All he wants is profit too.

574
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,550
He might ditch you at any time.

575
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,230
Taking my side

576
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,440
is the best choice for you.

577
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,890
You're a smart girl.

578
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,640
I believe you'll make a wise decision.

579
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,350
I'm not smart.

580
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,330
In this world,

581
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,200
I'm the biggest fool.

582
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,880
Chen,

583
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,590
why am I feeling

584
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,470
that the accident

585
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,710
has turned you into a different person?
