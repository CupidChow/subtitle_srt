Looking kind on the outside doesn't mean anything,

because she can be evil on the inside, which is even scarier.

Ms. Ai,

00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,390
can we not add a third party

10
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,030
that breaks the relationship as soon as there's development?

11
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,910
Isn't the relationship good as it is?

12
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:03,990

13
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:05,950
if there's no misunderstandings, how can it be dramatic?

14

If there's no breaking point, how can there be a misunderstanding?

This chapter is advancing the way you requested.

00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,710
Isn't it too dramatic?

17
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,710
The male lead saw those two fighting

18
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,100
and believed in what he heard without even asking about it.

19
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,830
At least Ye Yunkai has a brain even though it's useless.

20
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,240
The male lead doesn't even have a brain.

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,100
If a plot has romance, then there will be obstacles,

22
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,710
and only when there are obstacles, will there be a male and female lead.

23
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,110
If there's nothing but peace between the main characters,

24
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,990
then sure, the audience won't complain,

25
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,910
but they also won't watch it.

26
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,570
Can't you make it more classy?

27
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,789
The foundation of their relationship has always been fragile,

28
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:39,750
and just because the female lead changed a bit,

29
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,550
it doesn't mean it will affect the male lead's feelings for her.

30
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,840
Also, relationships tend to be ruled by emotions,

31
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,960
if one is able to stay calm when they're in love,

32
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,710
it means they've never really loved someone.

33

Don't tell me that

34
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:53,030
in the next chapter, the female lead will force the male lead back

35
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,430
and the two of them will torture each other.

36
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,470
No.

37

is this a marketing strategy for Ningmei Jewelry?

193

194
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,110

195

213
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,870

214

Taking a liking to his potential,

216
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,580
I came up with the idea that

217
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,840
since we are all in the jewelry industry,

218
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,760
why don't we all work together,

219
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,390
and make money together?

220
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,090
I'm afraid his brand's level and scale

221
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,510
may not bring us much value.

222
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,230

373
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,990
Sorry, we're closed,

374
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:19,790
please leave.

375
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,550
Cha,

376
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,790
I feel sick.

377
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,270
Can you get me a glass of water?

378
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,310
No, I said we're closed.

379
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,310
You should leave.

380
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:31,910
Get up.

381
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,040
What are you doing?

382
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,140
Cha,

383
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,350
I miss you so much.

384
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,940
Are you crazy?

385
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,790
Why did everyone I trusted

386
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,790
betray me one by one?

387
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,420
What's real and what's fake?

388
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:50,350
This is what you get for being someone's mistress.

389
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:54,830
Hey!

390
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,530
Don't play dead.

391
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,030
Wake up.

392
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:02,790
Wake up!

393
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,350
Cha, I'm tired.

394
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:14,350
I want to just lie in the hospital and never wake up,

395
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,550
that way I won't have to face this filthy world.

396
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:24,190
Ning Mochen, if you're going to act crazy, go somewhere else.

397
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,750
Don't disgust me here.

398
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,130
Don't throw up!

399
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:29,950
I know,

400
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:34,670
women who drown their sorrows with alcohol are the worst.

401
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,290
Stop drinking.

402
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,910
Leave me alone!

403
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:46,630
Stop drinking.

404
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,090
Just let me drink to death!

405
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,550
Stop drinking!

406
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,750
Bai Li!

407
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,400
He abandoned me!

408
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,620
So he abandoned you,

409
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,400
and now you don't even want yourself?

410
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,260
A woman who drowns her sorrows with alcohol is the most embarrassing.

411
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,210
If you're still the Cha I know,

412
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,170
get up now.

413
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,990
Why did I drink so much?

414
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,490
I can't drink excessively like Ning Mochen.

415
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,510
But,

416
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:09,950
I can take advantage of Ning Mochen's wealth

417
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,360
to enjoy life a bit.

418
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,470
I must pull myself together.

419
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,230
Waiter,

420
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,030
I'll pay for that lady over there.

421
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,040
Hello, the bill please.

422
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,740
Just now, there was a man who paid it for you.

423
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:39,830
There's no need,

424
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,820
please give him a refund,

425
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,950
I'll pay for myself.

426
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,280
Okay.

427
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:46,940
Here you go.

428
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,590
Thank you.

429
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,310
Goodbye.

430
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,060
Is it that difficult to buy you a meal?

431
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:02,810
Do I know you?

432
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,000
You don't have to pretend like you don't know me.

433
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,670
I've been looking for you.

434
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,910
You don't answer my calls,

435
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:13,800
or reply to my texts.

436
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,190
I always come to this restaurant, where we first met,

437
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,390
just to get a chance to meet you again.

438
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,050
Are we close?

439
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,010
I'm Yang Guang.

440
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,240
Don't you remember me?

441
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,260
I'm sorry,

442
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,220
I don't know you.

443
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,190
Ms. Ning,

444
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,770
tomorrow's the day for your check-up,

445
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,270
will you be coming?

446
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,450
Why am I

447
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,830
becoming more like Ning Mochen?

448
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,070
When can I be myself again?

449
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,130
[Lingyu Psychology Clinic]

450
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:35,700
Ms. Ning,

451
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,800
it's been a long time since you last came here.

452
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,030
A lot has happened recently.

453
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,150
What happened?

454
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,100
Can you tell me?

455
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,860
If you want.

456
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,400
It's not something that can be explained using a few words.

457
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,240
Anyways,

458
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:02,240
things have gotten to a point where I can't handle them myself anymore.

459
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,050
I'm so tired.

460
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,240
I wish none of this had happened.

461
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,580
I don't want to act as Ning Mochen anymore.

462
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,750
The people of the Ning family,

463
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,470
Ye Yunkai,

464
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,090
I wish all of this was a dream.

465
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:39,640
A dream that I can quickly wake up from.

466
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:50,750
Hello?

467
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,880
Another family gathering?

468
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,470
I'm busy, I can't make it.

469
00:29:59,110 --> 00:29:59,880
What?

470
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,390
Su Yu and Ye Yunkai are also there?
