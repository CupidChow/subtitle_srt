00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,350
You've really changed a lot.

191
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,510
You've become...

192
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,660
totally different.

193
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,510
Because you've never really understood me.

194
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,230
Indeed.

195
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,880
I've never really understood you.

196
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,350
Do you

197
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,990
still hate me now?

198
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,830
I don't know.

199
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,740
Did you check Bai Li's room?

200
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,750
Yes.

201
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,660
Room 1605's Bai Li is awake!

202
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,790
Relax.

203
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,110
Okay.

204
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,310
Can you see my finger?

205
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,350
Yes.

206
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,040
Good.

207
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,210
What is one plus one?

208
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,390
Two.

209
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,630
What's your name?

210
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:10,830
Do you remember

211
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,910
what happened before you came here?

212
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,190
For example, where do you live?

213
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,680
What's your surname?

214
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,470
Bai Li.

215
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,670
My name is

216
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,630
Bai Li.

217
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,790
Mochen, you sure are busy.

218
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,650
It takes multiple invites to get you home for a meal.

219
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,500
Don't you dislike me being here?

220
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,160
Why did you call me back?

221
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,230
I called you here to warn you

222
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,790
to stay away from Su Yu.

223
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,750
How I associate with him is my business.

224
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,840
Are you still clueless?

225
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,270
Su Yu's been using you

226
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,230
the whole time you've been with him.

227
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,910
Ning Mochen's smart

228
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,590
and around Su Yu all the time.

229
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,790
Can she not tell Su Yu’s intentions?

230
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,530
I think she deliberately lured the wolf into the house.

231
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,510
How much do you know about Su Yu’s plan?

232
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:09,930
Is that important?

233
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:13,210
You know the atrocities the Ning family has caused.

234
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:16,079
Even without Su Yu, there'll be someone else.

235
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,680
Maybe Su Yu is just the beginning.

236
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,119
What did you say?

237
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,990
How could you talk to Dad like that?

238
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,230
Listen carefully.

239
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:26,030
From now on,

240
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,730
I'm no longer a member of the Ning family.

241
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,480
From now on, we have nothing to do with each other.

242
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,030
Ning Mochen!

243
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,370
You're nothing without the Ning family!

244
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,110
Are you giving everything up

245
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,390
for a man?

246
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,650
Su Yu, what are you doing?

247
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,470
I’m free now. Care to meet me?

248
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,400
No.

249
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,880
That's too deliberate.

250
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,740
I'm finally free from the Ning family.

251
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,080
Let's celebrate.

252
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:25,930
[Typing...]

253
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,470
What does she want to say?

254
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,310
Bai Li.

255
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,050
Why are you

256
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,000
acting like a teen at this time?

257
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,270
Boss.

258
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,990
Why are you here?

259
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:36,990
I'm here to work.

260
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,470
I gave everyone a holiday.

261
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,100
Boss, you know how

262
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,710
I can't stand being away from the office.

263
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,770
So I'm here to handle some PR matters.

264
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,310
PR matters?

265
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,750
Boss, don't be defeated by some plagiarism accusation.

266
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,510
Your talent and popularity are all up to mark.

267
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,660
You won't plagiarize.

268
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,510
Everyone knows

269
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,870
there must be a reason

270
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,950
for what you did.

271
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,790
By everyone, you mean yourself, right?

272
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:02,750
Of course I created an account

273
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,190
to defend you every day.

274
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:05,950
Boss, don't worry.

275
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,550
Our company won't be doomed.

276
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,010
Wanna have milk tea together?

277
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,050
Boss.

278
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,070
You and Ms. Ning...

279
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,190
Aren't you here to work?

280
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,620
Go work.

281
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:28,670
Okay.

282
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,710
[Ning Mochen]

283
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,020
[Refuse] [Answer]

284
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,020
[Dr. Zhang]

285
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,190
Hello.

286
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,040
What?

287
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,310
Hello.

288
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,110
Ms. Bai Li.

289
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,070
Has Mr. Ye Yunkai shown up since you woke up?

290
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,550
Do you know Chenyun went bankrupt?

291
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,010
Have you seen Ye Yunkai's recording online?

292
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,320
Do you recall how you got into the accident?

293
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,230
Was it an accident or because of Ye Yunkai?

294
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,350
Ms. Bai Li, please answer our questions.

295
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,270
Ms. Bai Li, please answer our questions.

296
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,510
What are you doing?

297
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,450
Can't you see she's in pain?

298
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,310
Mr. Su, why are you here?

299
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,780
Does Ms. Bai Li know about your plagiarism?

300
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,070
How did you show up here as soon as

301
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,030
Ms. Bai woke up?

302
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,770
Does your fiancee Ms. Ning know about this?

303
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,080
Will your marriage be affected by the plagiarism accusations?

304
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,230
I have no obligation to answer any questions.

305
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,110
Please leave.

306
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,710
Well...

307
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,800
Stop filming and leave!

308
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,430
Let's go.

309
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,270
-What's going on?
-Seriously.

310
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,520
Senior.

311
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,000
It's fine now.

312
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,930
Don't be afraid.

313
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,830
Who are you?

314
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,120
I’m Su Yu.

315
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,930
Don't you remember me?

316
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,430
Su...

317
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,550
Who am I?

318
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,350
Why am I in the hospital?

319
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,260
Your name's Bai Li.

320
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,570
Because of an accident,

321
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,230
you've been in a coma.

322
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,240
Why can't I remember anything?

323
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,440
My head hurts.

324
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,470
My head hurts.

325
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,030
My head hurts.

326
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,030
Senior.

327
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:04,990
Listen to me, Senior.

328
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,390
Listen to me.

329
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,470
Listen to me.

330
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,240
Listen to me.

331
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,240
Don't force yourself to remember.

332
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,030
It's just temporary.

333
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,060
When you recover,

334
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,890
you'll remember everything.

335
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:18,900
Really?

336
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,680
What if my memories are gone forever?

337
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,670
I'm so scared.

338
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,730
That won't happen.

339
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,860
If that's the case,

340
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,110
I'll be here with you.

341
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,160
Don’t be afraid.

342
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,110
Su Yu.

343
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,100
I’m here.

344
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,700
Just remember my name.

345
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,200
Please don't let the media harass Ms. Bai.

346
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:55,570
We got it.

347
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,950
Did you come after getting the news?

348
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,510
Bai Li...

349
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,400
She lost her memory.

350
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,630
There's no brain damage.

351
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,430
Based on our observation, it's basically

352
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,760
dissociative amnesia.

353
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,160
Dissociative amnesia?

354
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,390
Most patients

355
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,030
aren't willing to recall

356
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,310
traumatic experiences.

357
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,190
So she subconsciously

358
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:32,250
blocks it out or even erases it.

359
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,380
Senior's suffered too much.

360
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,730
It might be good to forget.

361
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:42,350
Doctor, if she's really lost her memory,

362
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,190
how can we confirm who she is?

363
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,360
What are you asking?

364
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,280
I mean

365
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,990
how can I let her know who she is

366
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,560
and recall her past?

367
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,910
Well...

368
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,590
dissociative amnesia's usually temporary.

369
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,830
After some treatment and specific stimulation,

370
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,350
she could recover.

371
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,990
In other words,

372
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:09,710
stimulate her with something significant to her?

373
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:10,550
Yes.

374
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,590
But it can't be rushed.

375
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,800
It depends on her recovery status.

376
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,350
The most important thing is her own will.

377
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,110
This bracelet is...

378
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,180
This is...

379
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,110
This is a gift from me.

380
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,770
Why are you giving it to me?

381
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,310
What's our relationship?

382
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,750
I'll explain it to you later.

383
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:49,070
Can I contact you if I need anything?

384
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,390
Of course.

385
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,380
You can contact me anytime if you need anything.

386
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,070
Senior, take a rest.

387
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,730
I'll get you something to eat.

388
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,510
Okay.

389
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,190
Can you take care of her for me?

390
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,930
Don't mention the past to her.

391
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,510
She might not be able to accept it right now.

[Regulations on Ward Management]

393
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,000
Have you really

394
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,890
forgotten who you are?

395
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,440
Su Yu said

396
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,630
my name is Bai Li.

397
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:41,910
I'm asking

398
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,730
about who woke up in Bai Li's body.

399
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,360
You...

400
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,270
What do you mean?

401
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,000
Do I look familiar to you?

402
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,790
Do you know Ning Mochen?

403
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:13,550
Ning Mochen?

404
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:15,870
Yes.

405
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,270
The daughter of Ningmei Jewelry.

406
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,660
Her father's the chairman of Ningmei Group.

407
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,070
Her fiance's Su Yu, the one who just left.

408
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,310
Ning Mochen?

409
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,630
Yes.

410
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,210
Ning Mochen.

411
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:36,910
Yes.

412
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:42,390
Ning Mochen.

413
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,580
Who are you?

414
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,290
Tell me who you are!

415
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,110
My head hurts!

416
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,400
What are you doing?

417
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,410
My head hurts.

418
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,230
Senior.

419
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,050
I can't remember anything.

420
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,030
What did you say to her?

421
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,630
I told you not to provoke her.

422
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:15,950
[Regulations on Ward Management]

423
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:22,740
Ning Mochen.

424
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,380
You rushed here as soon as she woke up

425
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,570
and asked the doctor a ton of weird questions.

426
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:28,870
Now you're provoking her with your own matters.

427
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:30,140
What do you want?

428
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,480
She responded to the name Ning Mochen.

429
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,770
The doctor said we can't rush it.

430
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,520
Can't you see she's suffering?

431
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,110
The doctor said

432
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:50,430
dissociative amnesia can be fixed through hints

433
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,550
or specific stimuli.

434
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,290
So I tried it just now.

435
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,110
I'm sorry.

436
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,640
Maybe I was too anxious.

437
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:02,910
Sorry.

438
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,600
She lost her memory upon waking up.

439
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,520
That's why I was agitated.

440
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,660
It's hard to stay calm about things you care about.

441
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,610
I understand.

442
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,050
Let's go

443
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,480
get her discharged.

444
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,720
Show her familiar places

445
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,890
to help her regain her memory.

446
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:28,950
Senior.

447
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,470
Ye Yunkai sold this house to pay his debt.

448
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,080
I asked someone to buy it and restore it to its original look

449
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,170
so that you'd have a home when you woke up.

450
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,950
Do you remember who you lived here with?

451
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,550
Then

452
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:00,990
do you remember my relationship with Ye Yunkai?

453
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,930
Quit it.

454
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:07,910
Senior.

455
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,410
You just woke up.

456
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,800
Don't think too much.

457
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:11,920
Rest well.

458
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:19,530
I just want to help you recover your memory quickly

459
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,870
and not to force you to answer the questions.

460
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,870
Don't be nervous.

461
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:23,900
Take your time.

462
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,240
Since we're taking it slow,

463
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,200
let's not mention the past.

464
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:30,360
How can she take it?

465
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,320
It's late.

466
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,430
She needs to rest.

467
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,400
We'll get going.

468
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,110
Su Yu.

469
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,630
I...

470
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,150
What?

471
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,970
You want him to stay with you?

472
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:48,360
Will you?

473
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:58,740
Senior.

474
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:00,890
Have a good rest.

475
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,570
I'll visit you tomorrow.

476
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,290
I've informed your best friend Cha.

477
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,370
She'll be here soon.

478
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,300
Don't be afraid.

479
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,170
Let's go.

480
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,390
Anyway,

481
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:24,710
it's good that she's awake.

482
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,200
What?

483
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,240
Are you unhappy she woke up?

484
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,120
Of course I want her to wake up.

485
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:37,780
Otherwise, I wouldn't have insisted on her surgery.

486
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,350
But I didn't expect her

487
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,290
to not remember anything.

488
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:46,300
Memory loss may be good for her.

489
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,900
She can forget many upsetting things in the past.

490
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,710
But...

491
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,060
What?

492
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,670
Are you afraid she'll remember who you are

493
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,930
and become your enemy?

494
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,260
No.

495
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,820
I don't know how to say it.

496
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,030
Don't worry.

497
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,440
Without you,

498
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,860
it wouldn't have been easy to defeat Ye Yunkai.

499
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,330
Even if she remembers things,

500
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,460
I'll explain to her

501
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,990
what you did to her while she was comatose.

502
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:13,970
Like you said,

503
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:18,590
the irresponsible man's the cheater,

504
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,500
not the mistress.

505
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,480
Su Yu.

506
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,800
It's not that.

507
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:25,280
Then what is it?

508
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,620
Sometimes,

509
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,950
I think you're quite like her.

510
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,960
If you can let go of the past,

511
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,710
you may even become good friends.

512
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,600
Don't worry.

513
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,350
Senior's always been magnanimous.

514
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,480
She'll forgive you.

515
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,400
You're clueless.

516
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,750
It's not that simple.

517
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,170
Don't you want to be friends with her?

518
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:55,380
Then why did you tell her so much about the past today?

519
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,960
Ning Mochen, what are you thinking?

520
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,950
I don’t know.

521
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,430
Su Yu.

522
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,070
I can never be friends with Bai Li.

523
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,670
Because there can only be one Bai Li.

524
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,510
When no one lived here,

525
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,190
I came often to clean up.

526
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,590
So it's clean.

527
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,120
But we should still

528
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,470
change the bedding.

529
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:30,830
Bai Li.

530
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,980
You're finally awake.

531
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,950
How much do you remember about us?

532
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,590
I'm really tired.

533
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,560
I can't remember for now.

534
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,890
It doesn’t matter.

535
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,860
Su Yu told me over the phone,

536
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,720
that you just woke up

537
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:51,310
with no memory, so you'd be lost.

538
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:52,630
But fear not.

539
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,590
I'll stay here with you tonight.

540
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,330
We can sleep on the same bed

541
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,750
like before.

542
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:06,950
If you can't sleep,

543
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:09,040
we can gossip.

544
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,370
I can tell you what happened recently

545
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,010
or about our past.

546
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:16,650
I don't need company.

547
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,830
Please leave.

548
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,410
But you haven't fully recovered.

549
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,430
You need someone to accompany you.

550
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,920
I really don't need company.

551
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,320
How about I stay in the guest room next door?

552
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,420
If you need anything,

553
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,680
you can call me anytime.

554
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:46,160
I don't like outsiders in my home.

555
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,560
Then I'd better leave.

556
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:52,920
But if you need anything,

557
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,450
just call me, okay?

558
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,040
My number's in your phone.

559
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,160
I'm Cha.

560
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,070
Call me anytime.

561
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,280
Looks like Ye Yunkai's done for.

562
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:30,710
Next,

563
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,659
I'll put my new identity to good use.
