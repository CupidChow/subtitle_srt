00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,870
Why can she have a fresh start,

but I can't?

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,210
You've sent her to a psychiatric hospital?

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,070
You'd better tell me where she is.

Let me explain it to you.

21
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,230
Having characters bounce back from a slump is a strategy.

22
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,690
I've read about the slump.

Dr. Peng,

Conspiring with others to forge medical records

32
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,410
is not only unethical,

33
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,680
but also illegal. Do you know that?

34
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,350
You shouldn't do it even if a patient's father asks you to.

35
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,150
Mr. Su, are you suggesting

36
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,200
that I'm in collusion with Mr. Ning

37
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,550

that you're protective of your fiancee.

This is

often excited and agitated.

You can clearly see

54
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,650
that she was prone to destructive and abusive behavior.

55

00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,910
a recent medical record of hers.

57
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,950
She has repeatedly said

58
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,770
that she is not Ning Mochen.

59
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,770

she's different from the old Ning Mochen.

You're worried about losing to Su Yu, right?

80

As long as we work as a team,

It's true that some investors are selling off their shares,

I didn't know you had moved in together.

It's no wonder that you pretended not to know me last time.

Here's the thing.

122
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,940
Previously, I've bought some shares of Ningmei stock.

125
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,800
I need a bit more shares.

126
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,030
And so?

127
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,670
I want your shares.

128
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,510
Just name a price.

129
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,130
I want all your shares.

130
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,560

as an engagement present for you.

132
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,720
Why do you want the shares

133
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,550
that Ning Mochen is holding?

134
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,630
I want to be in charge of Ningmei Jewelry.

135
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,950
So you're planning to force Ning Zhaoxiong out.

136
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,880
For what reason?

137
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,190
Chen,

138
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,240
don't you always hate your father?

139
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,550
You approached me in the past

140
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,330
because you wanted to use me against him, right?

141
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,430
It's a pity

142
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,750
that you left me because I wasn't competent enough.

143
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,730
I hope your new boyfriend can be helpful to you.

144
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,890
I'm not selling my shares.

145
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:24,510
Why?

146
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,870
I promise you won't suffer a loss.

147
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,310
If you sell your shares now,

148
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,770
you'll earn a lot of money.

149
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,419
But once the stock price drops,

150
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,650
you'll be stranded.

151
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,600
When it happens, you'll lose everything.

152
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,799
I don't care of the price goes up or down.

153
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,730
I'm not selling my shares anyway.

154
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,340

Your offer is declined.

157
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,770
I guess today's visit

and you won't spend time with Bai Li alone.

169
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,930
These are two different things.

170
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,810
None of your ex-boyfriends are good people, are they?

171

00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,280
You have so much faith in Bai Li.

173
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,110

Are you also visiting Bai Li?

00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,770
But I'm not sure if I should get into the house.

178
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,320
How so?

179
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,470
Last time I was here, Bai Li was very upset.

180
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,500
She yelled at me and drove me away.

181
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,190
But you're Bai Li's best friend.

182
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,650
You care a lot about her.

183
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,060
Why would she do that?

184
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,350
Maybe she was stressed out

185
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,350
because she couldn't get her memories back.

186
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,390
Or maybe

187
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,160
Ning Mochen had some influence on her.

188
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,710
I'm not trying to defend Ning Mochen,

00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,550
but the recent happenings

190
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,270
have somewhat changed my opinion of her.

191
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,270
Indeed.

192
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,790
The more time I spend with Ning Mochen,

193
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,720
the more I feel she's different from my imagination.

194
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,990
This incident has really taken a toll on her.

195
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:50,590
Some terrible things she did long ago are revealed at this particular moment.

196
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,830
It seems odd to me.

197
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,710
Yeah.

198
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,920
There must be a ruse behind every unusual happening.

199
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,810
But what kind of ruse can stop the truth from being true?

200
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:02,830
Bai Li,

201
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,230
you're back.

202
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,890
A clean hand wants no washing.

203
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,790
If she didn't do what she is accused of,

204
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,520
the truth will come out one day.

205
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,600
The cyber bullying will stop eventually.

206
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,470
The two of you

207
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,410
shouldn't worry too much.

208
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,710
We were just chitchatting.

209
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,480
Go on with it.

210
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,020
Let's talk inside.

211
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,010
You aren't mad at me now?

212
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,210
Why would I be mad at you?

213
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,190
Let's go.

214
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,160
Come on in.

215
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:43,750
Thank you.

216
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,910
Look, Bai Li,

217
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,280
you left the hospital not long ago.

218
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,020
It must be boring to stay at home alone.

219
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,310
When you were in college,

220
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,830
you and Su Yu did design projects together.

221
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,750
You were the best partner for each other.

222
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,590
Why don't

223
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,710
the two of you design a new series?

224
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,970
I'm sure it'll be a hit.

225
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,200
I haven't designed anything for a long time.

226
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,470
I'm a little rusty now.

227
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,390
Even if I want to do that,

228
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,350
I'm not sure if I'm capable of it.

229
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,700
It's okay, Bai Li.

230
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,710
After you reach a full recovery,

231
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,150
you can try picking up the skills again.

232
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:16,910
Don't worry.

233
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,190
I'll help you find the old feelings back.

234
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,470
No need.

235
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,430
I have no inspiration for new designs now.

236
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,230
Bai Li, you're very talented.

237
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:24,790
Your talent is...

238
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,650
I've told you I don't want to do it.

239
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,390
Sorry.

240
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,500
Maybe...

241
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,940
Maybe because I can't recall anything

242
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,570
when you talk about the people and things in the past,

243
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,070
I'm a bit stressed out.

244
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,150
Alright.

245
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,760
Let's not talk about those.

246
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,910
I'm sorry.

247
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,760
You want my shares, right?

248
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,130
Let's meet up.

249
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,590
You guys keep talking.

250
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,720
I need to take a call.

251
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,520
Where shall we meet?

252
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,640
Are you recording this conversation?

253
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,480
This time,

254
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,450
try not to play dirty tricks

255
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,250
like what you did before.

256
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,200
I thought you were sent to a psychiatric hospital.

257
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,460
You would love to see that happen, right?

258
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,750
It's a surprise

259
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,950
that you actually know your way around Su Yu.

260
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,070
Even that big scandal

261
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,220
didn't make him resent you.

262
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,190
Instead, he let you move into his house.

263
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:56,910
As I expected,

264
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,150
it's you who sent Yang Guang over.

265
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,910
Now that you have gotten to know everything,

266
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,440
let's get down to business.

267
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,550
Sign it.

268
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:20,820
Ning Mochen,

269
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,270
have you forgotten

270
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,810
how much suffering

271
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,610
you've put me through lately?

272
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,730
In order to defeat Ning Zhaoxiong,

273
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,700
you've even gone so far as to ruin your own reputation.

274
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,430
You're determined to reach your goal at any cost.

275
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,070
For me,

276
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,210
reputation means nothing.

277
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,870
What's more,

278
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,550
someone else is taking the heat for me.

279
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,720
As for you...

280
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,700
Everything you have is supposed to be mine.

281
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,700
Now, I'm just getting back what belongs to me.

282
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,700
What about the bad deeds you've done

283
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,230
and the people you've hurt?

284
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,590
Those bad deeds

285
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,760
were done by Ning Mochen.

286
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,510
Bai Li has nothing to do it with them.

287
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,330
I suggest you

288
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,270
sign the agreement now.

289
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,220
Otherwise,

290
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,990
be it Su Yu or Cha,

291
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,350
whatever you cherish,

292
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,280
will be torn into pieces by me.

293
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,190
It's easy to manipulate

294
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,290
people like you.

295
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,840
[Equity Transfer Agreement]

296
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,310
[Ning Mochen]
[Bai Li]

297
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:11,550
I'm not interested in Ningmei's shares.

298
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,520
I just want my things back.

299
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,590
Bai Li,

300
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,730
this isn't over yet.

301
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,510
It looks like

302
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,270
Ning Mochen will make a new move.

303
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,190
I wonder if Su Yu...

304
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,810
Have you eaten yet?

305
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:57,810
I’ll cook for you.

306
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,510
Su Yu,

307
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,550
if one day

308
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,190
Bai Li becomes your enemy,

309
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,070
what will you do?

310
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,530
That won't happen.

311
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,070
Bai Li will never be my enemy.

312
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,250
What are you thinking?

313
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,550
I want to go to a place

314
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,990
where no one can find me,

315
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,810
so I can stay away from the people and things here.

316
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,710
When are you leaving?

317
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,870
Tomorrow.

318
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:47,550
Okay.

319
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,300
I'll make arrangements.

320
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,710
Hi, Song Yu.

321
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,390
Hi, Boss.

322
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:57,780
Book a bed and breakfast place for me.

323
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,530
A quiet one.

324
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,660
Ms. Ning will stay there for a while.

325
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,360
Okay. I'll have it done right away.

326
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,390
By the way, Boss,

327
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,970
are you going with her?

328
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,630
Me?

329
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,050
I'm not going.

330
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:11,550
Okay.

331
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,150
Hi, Dr. Peng.

332
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,510
Can you arrange a meeting for me and Zhao Si?

333
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,260
Dr. Peng,

334
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,980
whose home is this?

335
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,780
Soon you'll know.

336
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,670
Ning Mochen?

337
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,470
Ms. Zhao!

338
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,700
Let's hear what she has to say, okay?

339
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,520
Ms. Zhao,

340
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,350
about what happened to Zhao Lin,

341
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,860
I'd like to give you my sincerest apologies.

342
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,670
Keep my brother's name out of your mouth!

343
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,590
Ms. Zhao, please calm down.

344
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,830
Take a seat.

345
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,810
Let's hear what she has to say.

346
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,840
About this matter,

347
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,730
I won't make excuses for myself anymore.

348
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,730
Before he passed away,

349
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,790
I should've gone see him.

350
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,350
I'm sorry.

351
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,740
How rare it is for Ms. Ning to say sorry!

352
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:32,790
Why?

353
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,280
Are you intimated by people's comments?

354
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,140
You want to silence me, don't you?

355
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:40,040
Are you going to threaten me or bribe me?

356
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,310
I just hope

357
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,390
the dead can rest in peace.

358
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,550
I'd like to bring comfort to his family

359
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,670
through apologies and self-reflection.

360
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,870
Even so, you can't earn my forgiveness.

361
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,460
If you need any compensation,

362
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,030
just tell me.

363
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,330
Ning Mochen,

364
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,090
we're talking about a man's life.

365
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,760
My brother died.

366
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,870
Do you think money can make any problems go away?

367
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,250
Don't take it the wrong way.

368
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,440
I mean,

369
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,880
no matter what request you make,

370
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,140
I'll do as you ask.

371
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,360
I can make a public apology,

372
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,210
or pay you cash in compensation.

373
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,130
My request is

374
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,860
for you to disappear from the world.

375
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,030
I can do that.

376
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,150
I will move away

377
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,700
and leave this city.

378
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,950
I'll stay away from your life

379
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,120
and never show up in front of you.

380
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,660
I won't take anything

381
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,760
from the Ning family either.

382
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,910
I promise

383
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,980
I won't get back to the way I used to live.

384
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,220
Are you satisfied

385
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,910
with this result?

386
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,230
Ms. Zhao,

387
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,180
I hope

388
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,180
you will recover from this trauma

389
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,110
and move on.

390
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,600
Your brother loved you so much.

391
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,550
You should live your life well for his sake,

392
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,220
instead of wasting your time on revenge.

393
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,470
Pursue his dream and whatever he started.

394
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,710
Have all sorts of experiences that he didn't have.

395
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,460
Make every day count. Right?

396
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:18,920
Ms. Zhao,

397
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,030
let's put some effort in it,

398
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,660
shall we?

399
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,330
So far,

400
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,520
we've bought 10% of Ningmei's shares.

401
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,990
Plus another 10% we've gotten from Chen,

402
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:49,670
Ningmei

403
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,090
will soon be ours.

404
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,450
-Next month, I plan to...
-When you get serious,

405
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,030
you look so charming.

406
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:58,710
Tell me.

407
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,080
What do you want?

408
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,670
I want to be

409
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,920
the board president.

410
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:14,210
Bai Li,

411
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,280
are you kidding?

412
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,490
You wanna be the board president of Ningmei Jewelry?

413
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,120
What makes you think you're good enough to take that position?

414
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,370
When the acquisition of Ningmei is finished,

415
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,300
you'll be its biggest shareholder

416
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,170
and the actual controller.

417
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,400
The position of board president is of no use to you.

418
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,190
What you need most now

419
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,350
is someone you can trust,

420
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,160
like me.

421
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,610
It's true that I'm not interested in being the board president,

422
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,710
but I also don't think I can trust you.

423
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,670
That's a hurtful comment.

424
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:52,670
What?

425
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:56,080
Aren't satisfied with being the actual controller?

426
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,890
All you need to do is yield profits.

427
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,470
Just let me take care of the business operations.

428
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:03,730
I guarantee that the stocks you're holding will be worth more and more money.

429
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,900
In this world,

430
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:09,000
the most stable relationship is built upon interests.

431
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,460
You'll give me what I want,

432
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,720
and I'll give you what you want.

433
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,020
We'll both get what we want.

434
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,560
Aren't we destined to be partners?

435
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:20,790
To be honest,

436
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,040
I've investigated you.

437
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:26,810
You've targeted Ningmei and Ning Zhaoxiong since the beginning.

438
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:29,420
I've done some observation lately,

439
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,400
but I really can't figure out

440
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,400
why you hate Ning Zhaoxiong so much.

441
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,910
Don't you think it's too late

442
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,620
to ask this question?

443
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,930
At first, we shared the same goal,

444
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,710
so I didn't ask too many questions.

445
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:48,370
Now, the owner of Ningmei is about to be changed,

446
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,310
and you want to be my most trusted partner.

447
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,640
I have every reason to know

448
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,860
the cards my partner is holding, right?

449
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,370
The cards I'm holding...

450
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,430
I was near death,

451
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,240
but God gave me a chance to start over.

452
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,630
Of course I can't waste it.

453
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,550
I'm not really holding grudges against Ning Zhaoxiong.

454
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,870
I just need a larger platform

455
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,790
which can help me achieve my goal.

456
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,850
I also need someone

457
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,590
who would be fully supportive of me.

458
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,330
I can let you be the board president.

459
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,140
You'll take the fame and I'll take the profits.

460
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,600
I also want Chen to be mine.

461
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,790
Remember,

462
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,500
Chen is the one person you must not touch.

463
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,210
Rest assured.

464
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,190
I'll give her that message for you.

465
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,560
You have noticed

466
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,490
that she is different from before, right?

467
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,690
Or let's say,

468
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,680
she is different from the old Ning Mochen.

469
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,340
She gives different reactions.

470
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,870
She behaves and speaks in a different manner.

471
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,790
Actually, the information I've gathered

472
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:54,590
shows that she has already displayed signs of delusional disorder.

473
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,570
The air is so fresh.

474
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,000
I'm in a better mood now.

475
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,360
How long can I stay here?

476
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,950
You can stay here as long as you want.

477
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,070
Hello.

478
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,790
You must be Mr. Su and Ms. Ning, right?

479
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,880
Welcome to my humble abode.

480
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,960
You are?

481
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,790
I'm the owner of this B&B place.

482
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,990
You can call me Jiang.

483
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,520
Come on. Let me help you with the suitcase.

484
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,430
It's too hot outside.

485
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,230
Let's get into the house.

486
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:41,890
Look at the scorching sun.

487
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,300
Ms. Ning might get sunburned.

488
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:43,830
Let's go.

489
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,090
You must be tired, aren't you?

490
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,760
Yeah. I drove for over ten hours.

491
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,660
Let's get the check-in done quickly so you can take a rest.

492
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,810
How is the environment here?

493
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:56,060
[Aikyam Zen]

494
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:53,030
The environment is very good.

495
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,910
This place has picturesque scenery

496
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,270
and many kinds of delicious food.

497
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,110
I'll make a list for Ms. Ning.

498
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,950
There are also many pubs for young people.

499
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,230
Very classy.

500
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,400
Get a drink when you have time.

501
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,630
Okay!

502
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,590
Your ID and key card.

503
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:14,920
Room 302 is yours now. Open the window and you'll see a river.

504
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,950
Mr. Song told me

505
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,610
that you only needed one room.

506
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,600
Won't you stay here?

507
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,750
Are you going back to the city today?

508
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,060
Well, get me a room then.

509
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:31,800
I'll stay one night.

510
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,200
I have to leave tomorrow.

511
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:36,790
It's my fault.

512
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,560
It's all my fault.

513
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,260
I-I shouldn't have said that.

514
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,480
You might be having a fight,

515
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,990
but it's unnecessary to rent one more room.

516
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,650
Such a waste. Don't you think?

517
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,870
Jiang,

518
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,030
we're not a couple.

519
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,510
We're not having a fight.

520
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,430
Ah?

521
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,970
Just get me a room.

522
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:55,950
Right away.

523
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,060
Oh, this is...

524
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,910
Here's the number of a car rental agency.

525
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:22,710
I'll put it...

526
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,550
Isn't this the bracelet I gave Bai Li?

527
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,920
Why do you have it?

528
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,680
Ning Mochen,

529
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,410
this doesn't belong to you.

530
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,120
Ten years ago,

531
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,690
it should've been Bai Li's.

532
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,870
Ten years ago?

533
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,430
If I had given it to her ten years ago,

534
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,920
none of these terrible things would've happened.

535
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,330
What I want to say is...

536
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,150
It's Bai Li

537
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,940
who gave me this bracelet.

538
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,830
Why did she give it to you?

539
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:22,670
Because she wanted my shares of Ningmei stock.

540
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,400
Why would she want shares of Ningmei stock?

541
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,080
Why would you give her your shares

542
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,610
in exchange for a bracelet?

543
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,350
Su Yu,

544
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,430
it's all true.

545
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,200
I'm not lying to you.

546
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,320
I will

547
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,360
ask Bai Li about it.

548
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,340
She might have never had feelings for me,

549
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,080
but given her personality,

550
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:49,630
I'm sure she'd treasure the presents she gets from others.

551
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,710
As it turns out, ten years ago,

552
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,880
Su Yu meant to give me this bracelet.

553
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,970
If he knows Bai Li gave it to someone else

554
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,890
in exchange for benefits,

555
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,930
his feelings will be hurt.

556
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,540
Ning Mochen said Bai Li gave her the bracelet for her shares of Ningmei stock.

557
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,680
Was she lying

558
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,730
or being delusional?

559
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,030
Su Yu?

560
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,400
You're still up?

561
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:45,940
Aren't you the same?

562
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,430
This place is far from the city.

563
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:05,360
I bet the stars would look better.

564
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,660
It's a pity that the weather isn't very good.

565
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,640
There's wind.

566
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,680
The clouds will go away.

567
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,440
Let's give it some time.
