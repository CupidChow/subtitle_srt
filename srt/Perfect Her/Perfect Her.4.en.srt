2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,670
I hope

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,590
you can stop Ye Yunkai from cooperating with Mr. Feng.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,150
Chen.

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,230
Let go of me!

6
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,790
As long as I give up custody,

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,830
the hospital can give up the treatment anytime.

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,050
You're tired of him.

9
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,660
So you want to use me to get rid of him, right?

10
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,610
Our cooperation

11
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,070
is just helping you establish yourself in the Ning family.

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,670
I don't want to interfere in your personal life or other matters.

13
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,110
The hero kissed the supporting actress who was reincarnated.

14
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,410
It reminded him of the heroine back then.

15
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:41,900
What?

16
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,350
Did the heroine have any special kissing skills back then?

17
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:44,990
Ms. Ai.

18
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,240
I know you want to increase the interaction between the hero and the heroine.

19
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,790
But we can't make it sweet for sweetness

20
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,710
and make them kiss for kissing.

21
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,070
Our comic isn't about sweet love.

22
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,200
Our comic isn't about revenge either.

23
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,590
It's already the third episode, but the hero and the heroine haven't been intimate yet.

24
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,510
We'll lose the audience.

25
00:00:59,230 --> 00:00:59,840
Okay.

26
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,190
I accept your explanation.

27
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,390
But it's already the third episode.

28
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,879
The heroine is still chanting,

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,360
"I only have this body.

30
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,950
This body is the only thing I can use.

31
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:08,990
I won't let you win."

32
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:09,990
Is she playing games?

33
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,390
The heroine needs to do things step by step.

34
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,910
Even though she does things step by step,

35
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,150
is it to hook up with Ye Yunkai unconditionally?

36
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,230
Ye Yunkai is so stupid. Does she need to hook up with him

37
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,630
and do things step by step?

38
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,510
Feel-good. I want it to be feel-good.

39
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:28,190
Even though you want it to be feel-good, you can't make it feel-good for feeling good.

40
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,250
Are you dissing me?

41
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,580
Did you just dis me?

42
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:31,160
I...

43
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,630
I dare not.

46
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,720
Song Yu.

47
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,070
Song Yu!

48
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:36,990
Boss.

49
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,320
What's wrong, Boss?

50
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,680
Did you see my bracelet?

51
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,310
No.

52
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,829
Who came in here after I left last night?

53
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:44,390
After you left yesterday...

54
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,000
Ms. Ning.

55
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,090
Ms. Ning was here for a while.

56
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,750
Ning Mochen.

57
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,270
Boss. So you were repairing this bracelet

58
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,680
to give it to Ms. Ning?

59
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,920
Go back to work.

60
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:57,590
Okay.

61
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,470
Ning Mochen.

62
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,370
Why did you steal my bracelet?

63
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,670
I'll return it to you.

64
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,310
But it'll take some time.

65
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,829
All you're doing

66
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,310
is to make me help you deal with Ye Yunkai.

67
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,190
Listen.

68
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,520
I won't help you.

69
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,880
I told you before that I have no interest in your personal life.

70
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,510
Su Yu.

71
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,790
Do you want your bracelet back?

72
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,520
Are you threatening me?

73
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,710
Listen, I...

74
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,190
Hello?

75
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,680
Mr. Su, I'm near your company.

76
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,780
Let's have afternoon tea together.

77
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,890
Send me the time and the location.

78
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,840
Su Yu agreed so easily?

79
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,990
He had no reason to refuse.

80
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,610
I'm kind of his sister-in-law.

81
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,680
But when I felt Ning Mochen out at the beauty salon last time,

82
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,650
I felt her relationship with Su Yu wasn't strong.

83
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,670
Your dad asked her about her relationship with Su Yu.

84
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,380
She hemmed and hawed.

85
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,670
According to Ning Mochen's personality,

86
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,670
she always exaggerates.

87
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,020
She suddenly became so low-key.

88
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,640
There must be a reason.

89
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,190
Su Yu goes to Ning Mochen's place quite frequently.

90
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,680
They're also intimate.

91
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,680
Su Yu even makes breakfast for her.

92
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,740
Keep an eye on them.

93
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,760
Don't just look at the surface.

94
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,310
Here.

95
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,280
Try this on.

96
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,070
It's so formal.

97
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,190
Anyway,

98
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:57,320
it's important for you to make a good impression on Su Yu.

99
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,110
Take this opportunity

100
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,500
to find out what their relationship is.

101
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,420
And play pranks.

102
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,750
Don't rush.

103
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,950
Before we know the situation,

104
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,810
don't show our trump card easily.

105
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,910
Mom.

106
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,030
Dealing with Ning Mochen doesn't have to be so complicated.

107
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,540
You think I'm worried because of Ning Mochen?

108
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,140
I'm worried because of Su Yu.

109
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,950
You and I don't know how deep he is.

110
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,870
Don't shoot yourself in the foot.

111
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,830
Got it.

112
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,710
Bring Su Yu a gift later.

113
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,910
Su Yu got everything.

114
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,170
What should I give him?

115
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,480
Why did you suddenly ask me to meet here?

116
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,270
I can go to your house.

117
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,200
I've been there many times.

118
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,470
I have the key too.

119
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,690
How was your conversation

120
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,190
with Mr. Feng?

121
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,470
The important part has already been settled.

122
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,530
We just need to check the details of the contract later.

123
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,390
So soon.

124
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,470
What?

125
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,770
Aren't you happy for me?

126
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,550
Chen.

127
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,830
Do you still remember

128
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,830
how many times we ate in this restaurant?

129
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,030
No, I don't.

130
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,550
I don't remember a lot of things

131
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,020
which happened before the accident.

132
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,470
But

133
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,220
I remember

134
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,510
you love this dish.

135
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,720
It seems that I have to move faster on my plan.

136
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,000
Hello.

137
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,750
Enjoy!

138
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:57,510
Thank you.

139
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,550
Thank you for coming, Mr. Su.

140
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,350
I'm very interested in baking.

141
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,390
I made this blueberry jam myself.

142
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,910
I hope you like it.

143
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,790
I don't usually eat sweet food.

144
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,590
Your sister will definitely like it.

145
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,950
My sister hates eating blueberries.

146
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,150
You're her fiance.

147
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,070
You don't know?

148
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,630
Men

149
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,750
neglect many details.

150
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,430
It seems that I haven't done enough for your sister.

151
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,230
In the future,

152
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,720
please remind me more.

153
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,900
By the way,

154
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,890
I want to ask you what your sister's hobbies are.

155
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,390
She...

156
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,150
She likes to play,

157
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:35,870
drink,

158
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,600
go clubbing,

159
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,679
and make friends,

160
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,980
especially friends of the opposite sex.

161
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,909
But don't worry, Mr. Su.

162
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,670
My sister is a good girl.

163
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:47,910
I know.

164
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,310
I like her frank and passionate personality.

165
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,970
We can complement each other.

166
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,030
That's good.

167
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,510
Mr. Su, you're an outstanding person.

168
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,670
You got engaged to my sister

169
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,070
not long after you returned to the country.

170
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,470
Rumor has it

171
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,150
that my sister has something to threaten you.

172
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,240
I guess she does to a certain extent.

173
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,350
Your sister told me

174
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,710
that if I'm involved with other women,

175
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,110
she won't forgive me.

176
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,150
Mr. Su, you're such a loyal man.

177
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,590
You visit her every day

178
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,270
and make breakfast for her.

179
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,800
But she's still so worried.

180
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,420
She really doesn't know how lucky she is.

181
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,240
How did you know I made breakfast for her?

182
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,720
I...

183
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,700
My sister told me this.

184
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,620
You agreed to meet me today.

185
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,510
Is it because you want to ask me about my sister?

186
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,480
I do have this motive.

187
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,300
But I haven't asked you

188
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,680
why you want to see me today.

189
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,610
Can't I see you if there's nothing?

190
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,430
You're engaged to my sister.

191
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,710
You'll be my brother-in-law in the future.

192
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,640
We haven't even talk much.

193
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,420
It's inappropriate.

194
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,840
You're so nice to my sister.

195
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,060
I'm relieved.

196
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,270
Mr. Ye.

197
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,290
This is the contract to cooperate with Mr. Feng.

198
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,680
We can sign it anytime.

199
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,630
Moxi.

200
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,580
Aren't you gonna invite me in?

201
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,150
Sister.

202
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,050
Brother-in-law came to me today.

203
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:46,810
Really?

204
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,640
Why did he go to you?

205
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,650
He asked me many questions about you.

206
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,810
Isn't it strange?

207
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,310
You two are engaged.

208
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,670
He seems to know nothing about you.

209
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,430
How are you getting along?

210
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,120
We're pretty good.

211
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,760
You don't need to worry.

212
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,140
Do you remember?

213
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,120
I had my eye on this house first.

214
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,390
I already paid the deposit.

215
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,640
But you always caused trouble.

216
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,950
So you told Dad you were moving out.

217
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,430
Out of sight, out of mind.

218
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,150
Dad likes me.

219
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,230
So I stayed with him.

220
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,630
So this house is yours.

221
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,910
Everything you have now was given by me.

222
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,350
Do you remember I gave you a few gifts

223
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,990
during the housewarming?

224
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,310
I gave you this rabbit toy.

225
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,820
We're so close.

226
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,180
We haven't seen each other for so long. It shouldn't be.

227
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,840
Do you want to drink with me?

228
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,630
Judging from Ning Moxi's attitude,

229
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,870
the Ning family is wary of Ning Mochen.

230
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,530
I can't waste too much time on Ning Mochen.

231
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:29,270
I must get close to Ning Zhaoxiong as soon as possible.

232
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,070
It's settled.

233
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,680
We'll sign the contract on Monday.

234
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,540
How are you going to celebrate for me?

235
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,750
Ye Yunkai.

236
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,950
Even without Su Yu's help,

237
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,250
I won't let you succeed.

238
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,310
It's inappropriate to visit Mr. Feng rashly

239
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,310
as Ning Mochen now.

240
00:12:58,990 --> 00:12:59,710
It's better

241
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,230
to start with Mrs. Feng.

242
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,360
Okay. I got it.

243
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,630
Okay.

244
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,230
Boss.

245
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,550
You asked me to make an appointment with Mr. Feng, but he refused.

246
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,340
Mr. Feng hasn't been active in the industry for years.

247
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,470
We invited him many times before,

248
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,390
but he refused.

249
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,910
Why do you want to contact him again?

250
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,430
I'm going out.

251
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,100
Hello.

252
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:48,430
Hello.

253
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,310
Can I sign up to learn latte art?

254
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,150
Of course.

255
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,880
You can choose a teacher first.

256
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,830
No need.

257
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,470
I did some research before I came.

258
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,150
[Today's Recommendations: Walnut Brownie, Basque, Lime Cheese]

259
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,870
Actually, I want to ask your boss,

260
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,830
Mrs. Feng, to be my teacher. Is that okay?

261
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:00,910
I'll pay anything you want.

262
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,430
Well...

263
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,890
But Mrs. Feng no longer teaches personally.

264
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,870
I see.

265
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,230
Actually, I learnt some stories

266
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,430
about Mrs. Feng and her husband before.

267
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,950
They're quite touching.

268
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,240
I heard they fell in love with each other because of a cup of coffee.

269
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,350
So I...

270
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,560
I'm really sorry.

271
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:19,990
Miss.

272
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,710
Why do you want to learn latte art?

273
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,990
Because I want to make a cup of coffee for a special person.

274
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,350
Li, I'll take care of this student personally.

275
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,080
[Today's Recommendations: Walnut Brownie, Basque, Lime Cheese]

276
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,190
You prepared so much.

277
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:48,920
These are

278
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,460
photos and reports of my husband and me?

279
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,600
Yes, Mrs. Feng.

280
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,950
I've prepared so much information.

281
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,270
But it was you and your husband who impressed me the most.

282
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,460
That's why I came here today.

283
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,830
It's been so long.

284
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,350
I'll teach you today.

285
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,840
Mrs. Feng, thank you so much.

286
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,790
No. I should thank you.

287
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,420
If you hadn't mentioned it today,

288
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,790
I would have almost forgotten the things in the past.

289
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,470
Actually, we're already engaged.

290
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,110
So I want to give him a surprise

291
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,710
and give us a special memory.

292
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,710
My boyfriend loves coffee.

293
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,550
That's why I came here.

294
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,230
It's also because of superstition.

295
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,070
Superstition?

296
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:32,430
Yes.

297
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:36,110
Because I think if you teach me personally,

298
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,030
I'll be as lucky as you

299
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,330
and grow old together with him like you and your husband.

300
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,270
Okay.

301
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:45,390
But I may need you to learn at my house in the future.

302
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,400
Why?

303
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,470
If others see me teaching you,

304
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,430
it'll be hard to explain it to some old clients.

305
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,470
Thank you so much.

306
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,670
Mr. Feng.

307
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,760
I'm sorry for the intrusion.

308
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,280
I'm...

309
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,390
I know you.

310
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,640
Su Yu.

311
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,350
You focus on silver jewelry now.

312
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,350
Your assistant also called me.

313
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,300
Didn't I refuse?

314
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,550
I hope to talk to you face to face.

315
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,720
I barely know you.

316
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,430
We won't cooperate.

317
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,210
Mr. Feng.

318
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,150
Please give me five more minutes.

319
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,150
Who is it?

320
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,010
Why are you here?

321
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:45,670
Mrs. Feng.

322
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,060
He's my boyfriend.

323
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,090
Since you're Chen's boyfriend,

324
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,130
have a seat.

325
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,670
Let's go.

326
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,230
Feng, sit here.

327
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,550
Have a seat.

328
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,830
Here. Have some snacks.

329
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:00,730
Mrs. Feng.

330
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,520
Do you usually prepare snacks at home too?

331
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,359
Yes.

332
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,990
My husband likes eating them,

333
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,230
so I always prepare them.

334
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,910
We're so lucky

335
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,880
to taste Mrs. Feng's baking today.

336
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,480
Mr. Su.

337
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:14,640
I heard you love coffee.

338
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,670
Yes.

339
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,319
Coffee is his favorite.

340
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,640
Yes.

341
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,130
It seems that

342
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,290
my wife likes your girlfriend very much.

343
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:33,510
Mr. Feng.

344
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,750
I didn't know Chen knows Mrs. Feng.

345
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,780
And she didn't know I was coming to you today either.

346
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,230
You don't know?

347
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,020
How did you meet?

348
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,550
She's my student.

349
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,120
We... We get along well.

350
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,310
So I'm teaching Chen personally.

351
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,550
It's rare that you have someone you get along with.

352
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,070
But Mr. Su

353
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,830
isn't here for tea today.

354
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,090
Mr. Su. If you need anything, just say it.

355
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:08,150
Don't be frightened by Feng's fierce face.

356
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,790
Okay.

357
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:11,630
Mr. Feng.

358
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:13,870
I came here today

359
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,490
because I want to get your copyright.

360
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,320
Sorry, Mr. Su.

361
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:23,730
I've already promised it to Ye Yunkai from Chenyun Creativity Corporation.

362
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,150
Do you know he used your copyright to cooperate with Ningmei?

363
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:29,830
I know.

364
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,880
Haven't you always hated Ningmei?

365
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,280
Feng

366
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,830
has a history with Ye Yunkai's wife, Bai Li.

367
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,390
Feng admires Bai Li very much.

368
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,060
She had an accident and fell into a coma.

369
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,250
Ye Yunkai never gave up taking care of her.

370
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,100
It's rare to have such a devoted person.

371
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,050
Yes.

372
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:50,060
Although I don't want to get involved with the Ning family,

373
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,940
this is the only thing I can do for Bai Li.

374
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,790
I really hope she can wake up soon.

375
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,310
Mr. Feng, the thing–

376
00:18:59,310 --> 00:18:59,990
Mrs. Feng.

377
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,190
I heard you also graduated from the Experimental High School.

378
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:03,870
What?

379
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,510
Did you go to the same school?

380
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,440
Yes.

381
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,670
I remember there used to be a restaurant which had delicious pot stickers.

382
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,710
It was called Aunt Liu.

383
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,880
-Yes.
-I often bought them after school.

384
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,720
Feng also likes the pot stickers there.

385
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,350
Su Yu.

386
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,800
Isn't the Experimental High School near your house?

387
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,150
When we have time, let's take Mrs. Feng there

388
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,870
and have some pot stickers.

389
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,680
Okay.

390
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:24,720
No need.

391
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,240
I'll go there with her in a few days.

392
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,440
It'll be merrier if we go together.

393
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,120
But I can't go there tomorrow.

394
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,780
There's a VIP event tomorrow.

395
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,070
I invited everyone to have fun there.

396
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,200
You can go there too.

397
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:39,910
It's not appropriate.

398
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,190
It's not inappropriate.

399
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,220
Mrs. Feng, we'll definitely go.

400
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,030
Don't mind.

401
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,670
I was just acting.

402
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:00,870
Of course.

403
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,460
You finally remembered to act.

404
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,490
I didn't expect you to come.

405
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,790
I said I wouldn't help you deal with Ye Yunkai.

406
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,430
But I never said

407
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,980
I wouldn't fight for Mr. Feng's copyright.

408
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,880
Why are you smiling?

409
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,070
I just think we have a telepathy.

410
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,350
At least when I hinted that you should stop,

411
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,260
you understood what I meant.

412
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,930
I was too impatient.

413
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,230
What are you going to do next?

414
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,550
You mean

415
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,650
you agree to cooperate with me?

416
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,000
Ning Mochen.

417
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,990
Let me ask you again.

418
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,650
You did so many things.

419
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,910
Is it really because you hate Ye Yunkai's deception

420
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,640
and want to take revenge on him?

421
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,570
This isn't you.

422
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,570
As long as we have the same goal,

423
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,340
why do you have to get to the bottom of my purpose?

424
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,580
If you agree to cooperate,

425
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,880
come to Mrs. Feng's party tomorrow.

426
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,940
If you don't agree,

427
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:55,940
don't show up.

428
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,020
But I think you'll make the right decision.

429
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,910
Actually, you can get to know me again.

430
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,230
Why did Ning Moxi suddenly ask me to meet clients in the company?

431
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,660
I'm afraid it's another trap.

432
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,920
Although Ningmei is a high-end jewelry brand,

433
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,680
it's an old brand after all.

434
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:41,070
It's disconnected from current trends.

435
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,110
Give me a minute.

436
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:42,710
Okay.

437
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,610
Why is she here? Tell her to leave.

438
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,430
Dad.

Give Sister a chance

to learn about our company.

441
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,300
What can she learn?

442
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,160
Just don't make trouble for me.

00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,390
Okay.

Let's go.

[Jiusong Mountains and Rivers, Ningmei Jewelry Corporation]

448
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,230
Those are our new products this season.

449
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,510
Ningmei has a full range of jewelry on sale for Qixi Festival.

450
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,960
But the design,

451
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,870
such as the design of this necklace,

452
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,270
is a bit old-fashioned.

453
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,590
Why do you think it's old-fashioned?

454
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,880
For example, the leaves and the flowers embellished on it

455
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,430
can be seen everywhere.

456
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,090
Maybe our pictures aren't clear enough.

457
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,280
If you take a closer look, you'll find it's not a leaf

458
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,940
but a peacock feather.

459
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,020
This necklace focuses on low-key luxury.

460
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:09,190
It's like a peacock that doesn't want to spread its tail feathers easily,

461
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,050
waiting for someone to discover its beauty.

462
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,780
It's indeed a peacock feather.

463
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:13,680
I'm sorry.

464
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,240
I didn't see it clearly.

465
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,840
Today's consumers

466
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,710
prefer low-key and luxurious designs.

467
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,480
That way, they won't be said to be showing off their wealth.

468
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,140
It'll make them more stylish.

469
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:29,190
After all, Ningmei is an old brand with many years of experience

470
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,070
and unique design concepts.

471
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:34,860
It's not like today's new brands that blindly follow trends and seek change.

472
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,860
They lose their original charm and characteristics.

473
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,390
Are you the designer of this necklace?

474
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,310
I think you understand it more deeply.

475

Did you embarrass me on purpose just now?

480
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:09,110
It was you who wanted to embarrass me in front of Ning Zhaoxiong, though?

481
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,010
But you embarrassed yourself instead.

482
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,520
Don't think this can change

Mrs. Feng. Mr. Feng.

555
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,070
This is my sister, Ning Moxi.

556
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:37,750
Welcome.

557
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:42,750
You must be Master Feng, the inheritor of the Intangible Cultural Heritage.

558
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,000
You flatter me.

559
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,470
Where is Brother-in-law?

560
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,510
We were talking about that.

561
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,640
Your brother-in-law hasn't come yet.

562
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,750
I don't think Brother-in-law will come.

563
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,270
What?

564
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,410
How do you know?

565
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,900
Mrs. Feng, to be honest,

566
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:59,370
my brother-in-law isn't good to my sister at all.

567
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,500
Ning Moxi, what are you talking about?

568
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,850
Sister, you don't know.

569
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,730
You're about to marry him.

570
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,980
Yet he doesn't know what you hate to eat

571
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,440
and doesn't know what your hobbies are.

572
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,920
I feel he isn't good to you at all.

573
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:16,960
Isn't that Su?

574
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,630
Sorry.

575
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,470
I'm late.

576
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,210
You're indeed late.

577
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,030
You made your girlfriend wait for you.

578
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,830
It's okay. It's good that you're here.

579
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,310
Let's sit over there.

580
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,550
Come.

581
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,350
Here.

582
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,350
Be happy.

583
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:53,020
Mr. Feng and Mrs. Feng are so happy.

584
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,930
Love can be found in details.

585
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,330
It can't be hidden.

586
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,640
My sister and brother-in-law are too low-key.

587
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:04,150
They're already engaged, but they don't even hold hands in front of others.

588
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,420
Su Yu is just introverted.

589
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,810
He's not good at expressing his feelings.

590
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,530
Who said I can't?

591
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:22,870
Su.

592
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,550
Did you quarrel over something?

593
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,730
Mrs. Feng.

594
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,670
Didn't I tell you just now?

595
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,050
People can pretend to be lovey-dovey,

596
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,590
but details can't stand up to scrutiny.

597
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,780
No matter what happened between you,

598
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,430
Su, I think you should take the initiative.

599
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,590
Kiss Chen.

600
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,520
Okay?

601
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,010
We've made up, right?

602
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,790
Here. Cheers.

603
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,590
So,

604
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:59,550
you agree to stop Mr. Feng from cooperating with Ye Yunkai?

605
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,180
Yes.

606
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,000
But it's not because of you.

607
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,630
It's because of Bai Li.

608
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:10,190
Are you staying here tonight?

609
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:14,340
No.

610
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,010
I'm going back.

611
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,270
Su Yu.

612
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:22,500
Why do you care so much about Bai Li?

613
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,430
It's none of your business.

614
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,210
[Ning Moxi]

615
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:07,190
Hello?

616
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,710
I invited Su Yu

617
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:12,120
to meet me at the Hanging Garden of the W Hotel tomorrow night.

618
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,350
Come too.

619
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,510
Ning Moxi.

620
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,030
What do you want?

621
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,750
Did Su Yu agree?

622
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,000
Do you dare to come?

623
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,480
Your method of pushing people is so bad.

624
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,400
My method doesn't matter.

625
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:26,810
We'll wait for you.

626
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,770
If you don't come,

627
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:31,510
only Su Yu and I will watch this show.

628
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,610
What does Ning Moxi

629
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,570
want to do?
