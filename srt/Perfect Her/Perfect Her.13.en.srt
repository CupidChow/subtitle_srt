Bai Li.

00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,870
Can I call you whenever I need you?

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,520
You can contact me anytime if you need anything.

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,750
Who is the person that woke up in Bai Li's body?

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,190
Ning Mochen.

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,830
Tell me who you are.

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,040
I told you not to provoke her.

What are you going to do?

00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,350
Boss, this is a comic.

15
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,110
It won't do.

If you talk like this,

17
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,190
then I'll have to explain it to you.

18
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,190
Are you dissing me again?

19
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,790
-Are you dissing me again?
-No.

20
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,870
-You are.
-I didn’t mean it that way.

00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,430
Bai Li, look.

25
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,090
These are the design drafts

26
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,420
you and Su Yu made together in university.

27
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,210
Senior,

28
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,310
we just want you to know about your past self.

29
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,150
We're not forcing you to remember anything.

30
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:47,790
Relax.

31
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,510
Su Yu was

32
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,910
one year below you in university,

33
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,150
but you two were the best partners.

34
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:54,950
Yes.

35
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:55,990
Even now,

36
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,710
I still remember the time when I drew

37
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:00,790
and designed with you in university.

38
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,550
At that time,

39
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,870
all we had to do was create imaginatively.

40
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,870
We weren't restricted by the client's requirements.

41
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,480
You are all here.

42
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,350
Ning Mochen, why are you here?

43
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,420
Su Yu called me.

44
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,240
I also want to help you regain your memory.

45
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,630
Cha,

46
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,120
I need to talk to you.

47
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,850
Can you come out for a second?

48
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,520
Bai Li, wait for me.

49
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,930
I'll be right back.

50
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,200
Was everything normal

51
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,150
when you accompanied her yesterday?

52
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,480
What do you want to know?

53
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,170
Cha, we've been through so much together.

54
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,470
Do you still think

55
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,950
we are not on the same side?

56
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,600
To be honest,

57
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,590
Bai Li's condition isn't optimistic.

58
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,360
What do you mean?

59
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,070
Do you think someone's personality will change

60
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,830
after losing their memory?

61
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:05,880
I don't know,

62
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,700
but I asked the doctor.

63
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,490
Even if one gets amnesia,

64
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,880
it's hard to change one's way of thinking

65
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,340
and subconscious habits.

66
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,030
Hello.

67
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,070
Sorry to bother you, Dr. Peng.

68
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,970
I have a question.

69
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,340
No problem. Go ahead.

70
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,470
If a person loses their memory in an accident,

71
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,230
is there a possibility of them turning into someone else?

72
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,350
Technically, it's not likely,

73
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:36,920
but I've had some cases abroad

74
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,630
where a person experiences something major.

75
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,720
Afterward, they can suddenly speak a language they didn't know

76
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,050
and do something they couldn't do before.

77
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,050
How can I stop them from becoming another person?

78
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,490
Logically speaking,

79
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,150
you should have them remember who they are

80
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:57,530
before they believe they're the other person,

81
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,400
but it's hard to become another person,

82
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,580
because people's subconscious and habits are hard to change.

83
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,620
You mean...

84
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,840
Did you think some details from her actions yesterday

85
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,330
weren't like Bai Li's?

86
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,630
Actually, I didn't sleep at her place last night.

87
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,930
She said she didn't want company.

88
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,890
She insisted that I leave.

89
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,810
She was very cold to me.

90
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,220
To be honest, I've never seen Bai Li like this before.

91
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,950
The Bai Li that Cha described

92
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,000
is totally different from her pitiful look now.

93
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,680
Did she really lose her memory?

94
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,990
Do you remember these?

95
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,590
I heard people who lose their memories in an accident

96
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,990
still won't forget their original skills.

97
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,990
If you're given some time,

98
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,000
you should remember it slowly.

99
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,980
I seem to remember something.

100
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,159
Really?

101
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,710
That's great.

102
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,560
I need to take this.

103
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,480
The coffee here is good.

104
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,620
Why aren't you drinking it?

105
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,460
Didn’t Su Yu say you’re left-handed?

106
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,630
Why are you using your right hand now?

107
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,990
I don't think

108
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,520
amnesia changes one's subconscious habits.

109
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,380
I guess.

110
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,040
What are you two talking about?

111
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:46,960
Nothing.

112
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,140
Isn't she left-handed?

113
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,659
I found it strange that she used her right hand,

114
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:52,580
so I asked.

115
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,750
Left-handed?

116
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,470
Yes.

117
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,570
Didn't you say

118
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,120
she uses her left hand to eat, drink water, and drive?

119
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,790
When did I say that?

120
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,750
Yeah,

121
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,680
Bai Li is not left-handed.

122
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,750
How dare you play dirty with me?

123
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,940
You really are pretending,

124
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,270
Ning Mochen.

125
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,470
Su Yu,

126
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,990
can you come out with me?

127
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,910
She exposed herself.

128
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,510
If she were Bai Li,

129
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,040
she should've been confused that she didn't have this habit

130
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,260
when I said she was left-handed.

131
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,930
Why did she start pretending instead?

132
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,230
I don't understand what you're talking about.

133
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,460
She's acting as Bai Li.

134
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,600
Senior lost her memory.

135
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,440
It's normal for her to do something abnormal.

136
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,340
On the contrary,

137
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,670
why won't you let her go?

138
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,110
Don't you understand?

139
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,159
She's hiding something.

140
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,760
Her memory loss is fake.

141
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,640
What's there for her to hide?

142
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,030
Don't you think she's different

143
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,510
after waking up?

144
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,070
A person's nature won't change

145
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,530
even if they have amnesia.

146
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,400
I don't understand what you're talking about.

147
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,860
Do you also think I'm different from before?

148
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,370
It means your senior can change too.

149
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:06,320
She can change into someone you don't know at all.

150
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,270
Bai Li, what's wrong?

151
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,070
Are you okay?

152
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,400
-Senior.
-Does your head hurt?

153
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,050
Senior,

154
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,160
what's wrong?

155
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,840
I want to go home.

156
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,950
Okay.

157
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,080
Let me take you home.

158
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,490
I'll take you home.

159
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,429
Senior.

160
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,330
Ning Mochen is paranoid.

161
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,530
She doesn’t trust others easily.

162
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,790
Please don't mind her.

163
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,920
Are you apologizing to me for her?

164
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,650
I don't want you to be angry because of her.

165
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,290
Ning Mochen has changed a lot.

166
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,690
While you were unconscious,

167
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,460
she did a lot for you too.

168
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,650
According to what you said,

169
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,980
I should even thank her?

170
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:11,060
But I heard she's a rich lady.

171
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,970
I don't think she'd value it.

172
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,340
The Ning family members are all snobbish,

173
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,400
but Ning Mochen has decided to leave the Ning family.

174
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,210
Why?

175
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,160
She has a bad relationship with the Ning family.

176
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,820
She's always been oppressed.

177
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,700
To Ning Zhaoxiong, she's just a pawn.

178
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:36,800
I trust her.

179
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,710
If she leaves the Ning family,

180
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,900
she will definitely have a good life.

181
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,660
Ning Zhaoxiong.

182
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,760
The Ning family.

183
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,760
I will destroy you all.

184
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,250
Maybe

185
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,780
this is actually a good opportunity.

186
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,190
Senior, what are you thinking about?

187
00:09:59,170 --> 00:09:59,980
Nothing.

188
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,830
I'm just thinking

189
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,300
that since you think highly of her,

190
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,570
I should have more contact with her.

191
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,030
If I can't build a good relationship with her,

192
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,720
things will be difficult for you.

193
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,120
If there's a conflict...

194
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,580
You will definitely protect her

195
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,740
and I'll be sad then.

196
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,230
Bai Li, don't worry.

197
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,840
It won't happen.

198
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,790
Hello?

199
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,590
Let's meet up.

200
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,970
Who are you?

201
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,640
Don't you remember your own phone number?

202
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,080
Oh.

203
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,110
Ms. Ning,

204
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,880
what can I do for you?

205
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,920
I want to treat you to dinner.

206
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,130
Are you free tonight?

207
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,570
Sure.

208
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,760
[Yan Wu]

209
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,850
Mom, what are you doing?

210
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,510
I work here now.

211
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,710
How have you been?

212
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,350
Not bad.

213
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,110
Do you want to return to the Ning family?

214
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,020
You know Dad's temper.

215
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,060
It was hard for me too.

216
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,410
He's been very busy lately.

217
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,270
-Mom, after some time—
-Xi.

218
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,830
Don't call me Mom anymore.

219
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,770
If you want,

220
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,120
you can call me Ling or Auntie.

221
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,900
If you think I've disgraced the Ning family,

222
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,850
you can also pretend you don't know me.

223
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,600
Mom,

224
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:54,150
at that time,

225
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,870
Dad was also pressured by Su Yu,

226
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,870
so he had to find someone to give him an explanation.

227
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,120
These days, you haven't been home

228
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,550
and he's actually not used to it.

229
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,640
He misses you.

230
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,120
Your dad doesn't need anyone.

231
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,330
I've been with him for so long

232
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,310
and experienced so many things.

233
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,950
If I still don't have a clear idea about what kind of person he is,

234
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,810
I would be blind.

235
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,920
Whether it's me, you, or Ning Mochen,

236
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,030
we're all family,

237
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,650
but we're just pawns

238
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,180
for him to manipulate.

239
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,870
I'm fine now.

240
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,310
I've thought it through.

241
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,690
I want to live the life I want now.

242
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,720
I used to like to play around with flowers and plants.

243
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,770
You know that too.

244
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,490
I finally have a lot of time

245
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,430
to look into my hobbies now.

246
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:54,870
What about you?

247
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,410
You bought so many things.

248
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,540
You must be running out of space at home.

249
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,550
You don't plan on coming back, but you're still controlling me.

250
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,950
I'm not controlling you.

251
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,400
I want to remind you

252
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:09,050
that everything in the world

253
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,500
has its price.

254
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,700
Like with the things you bought,

255
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:15,830
don't just look at their glamorous appearance.

256
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,380
As a part of the Ning family,

257
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,000
while you're enjoying your lavish lifestyle,

258
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,240
you also have to be ready to

259
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:29,190
be sacrificed and exchanged for interests at any time.

260
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,190
Have you really thought it through?

261
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,370
Doesn't that mean

262
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,220
I'm worth the price?

263
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,810
Should I really give up everything and start over

264
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,860
in order to seem noble?

265
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,410
Chen Ling, time to work.

266
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,240
Okay, I got it.

267
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,150
Xi, wait for me.

268
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,970
What is this?

269
00:14:59,230 --> 00:14:59,990
It's for you.

270
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,390
Doubtful knight's-spur.

271
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,550
Look at its shape.

272
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,370
Doesn't it look like a swallow flying freely?

273
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:07,430
Okay,

274
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,460
thank you.

275
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,110
I'll visit you more in the future.

276
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,730
Okay.

277
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,960
This is your favorite restaurant.

278
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,960
I ordered your favorite dishes.

279
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,310
Really?

280
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,180
I don't remember coming here before.

281
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,210
Indeed, Bai Li hasn't been here.

282
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,730
I'm talking about you.

283
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,480
I don't understand what you're talking about.

284
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,880
There's no one else here.

285
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,540
You can stop acting,

286
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:36,880
Ning Mochen.

287
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,810
Ms. Ning,

288
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,570
you're confusing me.

289
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,460
You and I both know the situation now,

290
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,180
but I don't know what your purpose is.

291
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,790
If you want to say something,

292
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,180
just be straightforward about it.

293
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,690
My brain has been in a mess recently.

294
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,420
I don't want to guess at riddles.

295
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,050
You can copy me for a while,

296
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,950
but can you do it forever?

297
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,710
Why would I copy you?

298
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,400
See?

299
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,670
You're still used to

300
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,040
picking out the mushrooms in the food.

301
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,950
You must've forgotten.

302
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,730
You're in Bai Li's body now.

303
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,330
You're no longer allergic to mushrooms.

304
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,850
What are you talking about?

305
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,830
I just don't like mushrooms.

306
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,150
Ning Mochen,

307
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,520
you will give yourself away sooner or later.

308
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,380
I don’t care what your purpose is,

309
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,210
but I hope you won’t hurt Su Yu with my identity.

310
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,120
He has nothing against you.

311
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,590
Su Yu?

312
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,410
This junior is nice to me.

313
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,310
Why would I hurt him?

314
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,810
What exactly do you want?

315
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:06,069
I have no purpose.

316
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:08,550
What I have now

317
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,900
is everything you don't have.

318
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,040
People will find out

319
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,369
what kind of person you are sooner or later.

320
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:20,190
Even if you have Bai Li's body,

321
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,980
you'll always be Ning Mochen.

322
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,510
In that case,

323
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,760
I'll tell you the truth.

324
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,340
No matter who I am,

325
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,400
you'll always be that

326
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,660
promiscuous,

327
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,150
ignorant,

328
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,830
and crazy

329
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,980
home-wrecker.

330
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,960
The one hated by everyone,

331
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,540
Ning Mochen.

332
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,030
Give me back my bracelet!

333
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:05,920
Give it to me!

334
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,260
-Give it back!
-Give it to me!

335
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:07,990
Give it to me!

336
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:12,770
Senior.

337
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:13,990
Are you okay?

338
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,060
What did you do?

339
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,960
She fell down herself.

340
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,940
Come. Get up.

341
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,950
Are you okay?

342
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,110
You all become hesitant when mentioning about me and Ye Yunkai,

343
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,920
so I asked Cha.

344
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,420
It was her.

345
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,730
She was the one who seduced my husband

346
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,120
and ruined my family.

347
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,850
I know you are good friends,

348
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,220
so I came.

349
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,170
But then...

350
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,750
She kept forcing and provoking me

351
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,040
again and again,

352
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,470
so I dissed her back.

353
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,560
Then she grabbed my hand.

354
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,890
Stop talking nonsense.

355
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,550
Did you call Su Yu here?

356
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,470
You deliberately provoked me

357
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,600
just to act in front of him, right?

358
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,270
Enough!

359
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,150
Ning Mochen,

360
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,280
I was wrong about you.

361
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:16,830
Senior.

362
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,280
Here, Senior.

363
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,990
Thank you.

364
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,670
So,

365
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,430
I had an accident because of Ye Yunkai and Ning Mochen.

366
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,520
No wonder every time I see her,

367
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,800
I feel uncomfortable.

368
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:45,790
Maybe

369
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:48,900
my subconscious is protecting myself.

370
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,980
It doesn't want me

371
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:55,530
to see the third person who intervened in my marriage.

372
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,530
Luckily, you were here today.

373
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,870
Otherwise,

374
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,820
I might have been badly hurt.

375
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,800
She was so cruel.

376
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,370
She insisted on snatching this silver bracelet today.

377
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,990
I know

378
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,950
this is your kind intention.

379
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,510
But

380
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,560
she is your fiancée, after all.

381
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,490
You should give this to her.

382
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,200
Senior,

383
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,650
since I gave it to you,

384
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,140
I have no intention of taking it back.

385
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:45,990
Besides,

386
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,390
my relationship with Ning Mochen

387
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,160
isn't what you think.

388
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,620
She must be mad at you today.

389
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,090
I'm sorry.

390
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,330
I don't want to

391
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,490
affect your relationship.

392
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,900
Senior, don't say that.

393
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,370
It's getting late.

394
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,410
I have to go back.

395
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,860
Don’t think too much.

396
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:15,750
Su Yu.

397
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,260
Nothing.

398
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:27,090
Go and accompany the person you want to accompany.

399
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,960
Since I'm Bai Li now,

400
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,910
maybe I should change my plan

401
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:52,190
to deal with Ningmei and Ning Zhaoxiong.

402
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,210
Su Yu’s attitude is wavering now.

403
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,110
Ye Yunkai is missing too.

404
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,510
I can’t count on them now.

405
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:04,320
Looks like I need someone else

406
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,210
to help me complete my plan.

407
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,110
As for the candidate,

408
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:16,470
it'll depend on Ms. Bai Li's charm.

409
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,000
Why are you here?

410
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,660
I was just passing by

411
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,370
and came to visit you.

412
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,520
Did you come

413
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,890
from your senior's place?

414
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,000
Ning Mochen.

415
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,110
Can we talk?

416
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,300
About what?

417
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,780
How she talks about me,

418
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,190
how bad I am,

419
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,880
how shameless,

420
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,950
and how evil, right?

421
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,010
It's not like that.

422
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:17,870
She said

423
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,680
she doesn't want to affect our relationship.

424
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,000
If you put it like that,

425
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,350
then I'm the horrible one.

426
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,990
You've been criticizing her all this time.

427
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,280
Then tell me

428
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,370
what's wrong with her.

429
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:40,500
Su Yu,

430
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,490
she is using your feelings for her

431
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,510
to control you.

432
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,960
She doesn't want us to get into a relationship again.

433
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,160
Why would she do that?

434
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,590
There can be many reasons.

435
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:54,710
For example,

436
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,270
she doesn't want us to be how we are now.

437
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,770
How we are now?

438
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,710
Why would she interfere in this?

439
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,100
Or maybe

440
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,110
she just doesn't like me.

441
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,400
Or maybe she didn't lose her memory

442
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,440
and just wants revenge.

443
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,890
Any reason is possible.

444
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,430
She's not like that.

445
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,870
She has been trying hard to forgive you.

446
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,410
It's just that she can't do it so quickly.

447
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,870
Why did you come here if you don't believe me?

448
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,050
Then I'll leaving.

449
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:37,190
Su Yu and Cha still believe in the Bai Li they see more.

450
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,240
The more I want to expose Ning Mochen,

451
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,170
the more she'll seem innocent.

452
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,310
I can't be impatient.

453
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,880
Ms. Bai.

454
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,600
Ms. Bai, how have you been recovering?

455
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,760
My body has recovered,

456
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,110
but my brain

457
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,310
feels like it's in a mess.

458
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,790
You just experienced some trauma.

459
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:39,350
While you were in a coma,

460
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,950
your subconscious mind occupied your brain,

461
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:44,150
causing your neurons to be disordered,

462
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,830
so there are some cluttered messages.

463
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,540
Do you want to continue the previous treatment?

464
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,140
What do you think?

465
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,080
As the doctor,

466
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,810
I can only give advice about whether to continue or not.

467
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,200
The final decision is still up to you.

468
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,840
Dr. Peng, you mean

469
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,930
whether we should continue or not

470
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,270
depends on me, right?

471
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,670
Of course.

472
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,350
You always encounter people with broken hearts

473
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,270
or those who are not happy with work.

474
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,560
Isn't it boring?

475
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,600
Ms. Bai, you're very humorous.

476
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,910
Since they come here,

477
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,130
I obviously hope I can help them.

478
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,610
Then you probably look forward to

479
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,390
some more extreme or crazier patients.

480
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:44,620
Wouldn't that show your skills as a doctor more?

481
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:50,540
Doctors and patients are more like friends.

482
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:53,250
Of course, I also hope to meet someone

483
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,010
who fits me well,

484
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,650
but treating patients

485
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,850
or being able to help them completely

486
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,160
is my biggest wish.

487
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,240
Do you think I'm sick?

488
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,600
In terms of conditions,

489
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,310
you do have some.

490
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:33,210
That's why you need a psychologist like me.

491
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,950
What if a psychologist gets sick?

492
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,140
A doctor can't treat himself.

493
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,210
When a psychologist gets sick,

494
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,720
we also need to prescribe the right medicine.

495
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,320
Have you found your medicine?

496
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,590
I don't want to drink water.

497
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,560
Don't drink yours either.

498
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:18,250
I remember... Where do you put your wine?

499
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,290
I found it.

500
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,950
Dr. Peng,

501
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,060
what's wrong?

502
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,380
Is something wrong?

503
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,180
No.

504
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:14,790
Ms. Bai, I remember you didn't drink wine before.

505
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,580
Maybe it's like what you said.

506
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,390
Some changes happened after sleeping for so long.

507
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,350
This kind of alcoholic and stimulating drink

508
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,630
will affect your nerve transmission

509
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,740
and aggravate your condition.

510
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,340
I suggest you quit drinking.

511
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,210
Cheers.

512
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,350
By the way,

513
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,150
I have a present for you.

514
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,270
A normal life

515
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,540
and boring work...

516
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,560
You've long been tired of it.

517
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,510
Actually, deep down,

518
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,990
you look forward to something more exciting.

519
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,290
I told you long ago

520
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,590
that I

521
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,750
am your medicine.

522
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:04,430
A psychologist that fell in love with his patient.

523
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,180
Would this scandal

524
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,030
be exciting enough?

525
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:11,820
Or maybe I can change the title to

526
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,740
"Psychologist Sexually Harasses His Patient."

527
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:21,410
Wouldn't that be more eye-catching?

528
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,350
Ning Mochen,

529
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,590
what do you want?

530
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,330
I'm threatening you,

531
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,900
so you have to listen to me.

532
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,010
What's wrong?

533
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,770
Is something bothering you?

534
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,370
Ye Yunkai has gone bankrupt.

535
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,120
You can't use him anymore.

536
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,260
You're already Bai Li.

537
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,780
Are you still going to go after the Ning family?

538
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,780
You can't

539
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,400
compete with Ning Zhaoxiong now.

540
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,310
I have you, Dr. Peng.

541
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,280
Let's obliterate Ningmei Jewelry

542
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,510
together.

543
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,410
The show has just started.

544
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,730
The good stuff is still coming up.
