I don't need you to take care of me!

♫Dry the tears as the beginning of change♫

389
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,550

Even if I'm a patient,

391
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,530
you can't be my doctor.

392
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,790
How did you know that?

393
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,090
Was it you who told on me?

394
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,690
Why did you do that to me?

396

399

By the way,

400

I forgot to tell you something.

Su Yu, good morning.

407
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:50,990
Morning.

408
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,200
I heard there would be a fair in town today.

409
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,530
Shall we go check it out?

410
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,200
Anything wrong?

411
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,070
Nothing.

412
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,110
If

413
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:07,740
what I said to you last night

414
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,220
has become a burden to you,

415
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,100
I hope you can stop thinking that way.

416
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,470
No. I'm just...

417
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,180
Actually, being in love with someone at the moment

418
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,680
doesn't mean you have to feel that way forever,

419
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,340
because people would change.

420
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,950
The most important thing is to find out what the people you're with are really like.

421
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,750
Always trust your own feelings.

422
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,770
It seems like you know what I'm thinking.

423
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,320
Of course I do.

424
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,210
I know what you're worried about.

425
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,550
It's okay.

426
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,150
I can wait.

427
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,370
I can wait till you figure out everything.

428
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,380
Alright. Cheer up.

429
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,270
If you're feeling fuzzy, just stop thinking about it.

430
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:48,830
Let's go.

431
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,030
Bai Li,

432
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,110
I gave you a lot of calls.

433
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,990
Why didn't you answer any of them?

434
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,270
I should be the one asking questions.

435
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:31,350
You took a trip to such a beautiful place.

436
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,040
Why didn't you tell me?

437
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,600
If I hadn't asked Song Yu,

438
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,950
I wouldn't have known you and Ms. Ning

439
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,920
were having so much fun here.

440
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,110
I'll go get some water.

441
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:58,390
Shouldn't you have been sent to a psychiatric hospital?

442
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,670
Su Yu saved me.

443
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,440
Such a surprise, right?

444
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,920
How does it feel to be condemned by so many people?

445
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,330
The scenery here is beautiful.

446
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,220
I enjoy my stay here.

447
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,430
You're hiding in the countryside now,

448
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,620
but you still wouldn't admit defeat.

449
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,990
What about you?

450
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,160
You've reached all your goals.

451
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,290
Why are you still upset?

452
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,300
Is it because you've realized

453
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:35,370
that revenge has only enlarged the void in your heart

454
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,910
instead of bringing you joy and satisfaction?

455
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,510
Don't be so full of yourself.

456
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,800
You think you know a lot about me?

457
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,150
I'm grateful to you.

458
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:46,950
Thanks to you,

459
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,400
I could finally get rid of the Ning family

460
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,360
and have a chance to be myself again.

461
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,030
Really?

462
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,030
Great.

463
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:02,270
Why don't we keep the game going?

464
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:06,870
Ms. Ning,

465
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,270
I have gotten Ningmei back as you asked.

466
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,990
Can you

467
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,340
give my bracelet back to me?

468
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,480
What is all this about?

469
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,700
Previously,

470
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,170
Ms. Ning took my bracelet away.

471
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,660
She said she would give it back to me

472
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,100
if I did one thing for her.

473
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,190
I'm sorry, Su Yu.

474
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,610
I did a terrible job keeping your present for me safe.

475
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:49,060
Framing me already, aren't you?

476
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:53,190
But you should've used your head before making up that story.

477
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,520
Why would I ask you

478
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:58,180
to overthrow Ning Zhaoxiong for me?

479
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,160
Couldn't I have done it myself?

480
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,100
I was also wondering why.

481
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,950
Maybe...

482
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,830
Maybe you wanted to drive a wedge between me and Su Yu.

483
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,500
You wanted him to mistake me for a greedy person,

484
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,300
and to use the bracelet he gave me

485
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:20,130
to get the position of Ningmei's board director for yourself.

486
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:21,720
Ning Mochen,

487
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,510
there wasn't a grudge between Bai Li and Ning Zhaoxiong.

488
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,640
What reason did she have to target him?

489
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:29,500
I remember you telling me

490
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,340
that you wanted to see Ning Zhaoxiong go broke and lose everything.

491
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,740
Besides, Yang Guang was behind the whole thing.

492
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,410
He is your...

493
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,090
Su Yu,

494
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,870
this matter is beyond common sense.

495
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,550
As I told you just now,

496
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:45,770
always trust your feelings.

497
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,870
I'm sorry.

498
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,960
I didn't mean for this to happen.

499
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,900
I'd hate to see you get in a fight because of me.

500
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:00,060
I just want my bracelet back.

501
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:02,780
Then let me be the board president of Ningmei.

502
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,280
I'll give you the bracelet if you do so.

503
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,600

00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,850

517
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,730
did you not answer my calls because you were mad?

518
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,500
What a surprise

519
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,410
that you're actually staying here with her.

520
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,390

528

529
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,270
I think

530
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,890
you should keep a distance with Ning Mochen.

531
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,690

00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,180

Welcome.

558
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,150
I designed and made

559
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,350
these accessories myself.

560
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:53,410
They're ideal presents for your loved ones or friends.

[Services: polishing, reconditioning, producing made-to-order jewelry]

562
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:59,600
Handmade products can't be put into mass production.

563
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,250
There's nothing special about the material too.

564
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,680
As for the craftsmanship,

565
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:08,270
most customers aren't able to appreciate it.

566
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,200
The sales aren't very good, right?

567
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,930
I wouldn't say you're wrong.

568
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:23,830
Of course,

569
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,830
silver jewelry has varied levels of quality.

Trinkets made in a small workshop like this

can't be compared with your designs, Su Yu.

572
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,920
You're running a fashionable brand.

573
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,610
With the help of brand stories and design awards,

574
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,870
your products are certainly different.

575
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,070
If you don't think my products are good enough for you,

576
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,060
maybe you should leave.

577
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,430
Miss,

578
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,630
is it the way you treat your customers?

579
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,070
So this tiny shop has a rude owner.

580
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,630
I wouldn't say I'm rude.

581
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,630
My small workshop really can't compete with those big brands.

582
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:01,710
Sorry, Miss.

583
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:02,300
We...

584
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,040
Goodbye.

585
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,430
Su Yu,

586
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:08,690
let's go.

588
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,250
There isn't much fun in this place.

589
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:24,239
It's so hot.

590
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,449
Bai Li, I'll buy you a bottle of water then.

591
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:47,870
What now?

592
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,230
If you want a stamp from the finance department,

593
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,270
then just go to them!

594
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,830
Why are you calling me?

595
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,920
You need my help with such a trivial thing?

596
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,520
What's the point of keeping you in the company?

597
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,590
Who disagrees?

598
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:07,440
Who does he think he is to disagree with my decision?

599
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,170
Don't forget

600
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,540
that I'm Ningmei's board director.

601
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,810
You wanna lose your job or what?

602
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,430
Just quit if you don't wanna work for me!

Thank you.

606
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,920
I have an urgent matter to attend to.

607
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,360
I might have to leave now.

Hi, Song Yu.

00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,180
Investigate a person for me.

611

I'll send you the information.
