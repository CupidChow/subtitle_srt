This is your reward.

18
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,550
There's starting to be hints of revenge,

19
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,670
and the main characters' kissing scene is also reasonable.

20
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,030
Especially in the last scene

21
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,950
where all ex-boyfriends are gathered together.

22
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,950
I'm really looking forward to how this story will progress.

23

25
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,789
don't you think the male lead's storyline is somewhat lacking?

26
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:11,789
Come on,

27
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,970
the female is the main character,

28
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,240
so of course, the storyline is going to be focused on her.

29
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,030
Who says the male lead can't stand out just because the main character's a female?

Mr. Su,

41
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,760
the three of us decided to come meet you

42

to prevent you from repeating our mistakes.

43
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,120

I feel the need to tell you the truth.

46
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,150
When Ning Mochen and I were dating,

47
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,990
she was also dating many other men at the same time.

49

and losing my children.

50
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,500
She's a compulsive liar.

51
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,330
She acts like a well-educated woman

52
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,570
and goes around seducing people.

53
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,350
Thanks to her, I lost my whole family.

54
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,160
She also likes to record things, right?

55
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,020
Yeah, exactly!

56
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,590
She even used it to threaten me before.

57
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,190
I did everything she wanted,

58
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,630
yet she still sent the recording to my wife.

Didn't you say you would never see her again?

65
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,560

00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,790

and we don't have to make things difficult for you.

69
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,070
This is the bag I took a liking to a few days ago.

00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,270
Did you buy it for her?

71
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,590
I didn't buy it.

72
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,430
I stopped contacting her ages ago.

73
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,040

Why did I have to meet a bitch like you?

75
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,310
Karma will get to you sooner or later.

76
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,310
Since you ruined our families,

77
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,590
we should all unite

78
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,400
so that you won't have a chance.

79
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,320
My husband used to treat me so well.

80
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,270
If only he wasn't seduced,

81
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,510

00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,110
Whether he cares or not is our business.

187
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,390
I'll leave now, as I have an appointment with Su Yu.

188
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,430

189
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,230
So,

190

Knowing that she'll be visiting the school with you two,

she was so excited that she didn't sleep well last night.

200
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,680

Yes.

224
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,590
Ning Mochen has become so weird ever since she woke up.

225
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,150
The way she talks and her personality are different.

226
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,230
Even her habits are different.

227
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,290
Before, she was never afraid of dogs,

228
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,960
but when she saw Dou Dou today, she was really scared.

229
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,590
What did you do to her

230
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,750
to make your dad that upset?

231
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,950
That's not important.

232
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,410
What matters is that she's getting weirder.

233
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,790
She's not like herself anymore.

234
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,870
What are you talking about?

235
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,200
You're being paranoid.

236
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:20,150
Ever since she woke up, she's been working really hard.

237
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,150
Not only does she work hard,

238
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,230
but she also has an unnatural ability.

239
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,240
Last time when she met a client at the company,

240
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,600
she could analyze the products

241
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,350

242
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,550
It's so strange.

You're right,

244
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,720
last time when she was home, she called me mom.

245
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,550
I heard that after a big surgery

246
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,230
a person can change a lot.

247
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,400
But she didn't get any surgeries.

Anyway,

249
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,840
in a way she gave us a warning this time.

250
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,620
From now on,

251
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,770

I'm going to the hospital

254
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,550
to see if there's anything we haven't found out about.

255
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,510
I think there must be something we don't know.

But while I was repairing it,

271
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,120
I noticed that this is my work.

272
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,020
I carved it for Ms. Bai Li,

273
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,750
so why is it with Mr. Su?

274
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,660
Actually, Su Yu was Bai Li's junior.

275
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,430
They were in the same club back in college.

276
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:21,290
This bracelet is very precious to him.

277

So there's a story behind this.

278

Honestly, the one who's most compatible with Bai Li

279
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,000
and understands what Bai Li wants,

280
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,550
is Su Yu.

281
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,550
Also, Su Yu never used Bai Li

how much Bai Li respects you,

286
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,480

00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,790
This is the thing you asked for.

372
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,330
Thank you so much, Mrs. Feng.

373
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,070
Here.

374
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,340
What is this?

375
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,470
You'll see.

376
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,000
Last time, I saw that you couldn't fix it,

377
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,190
so I asked Mr. Feng for help.

378
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,980
Why did you touch my stuff?

379
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,320
Do you know how important this is to me?

380
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,940
I know,

381
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,790
so you must cherish it.

382
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,390
Don't break it again.

383
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,240
How do you know about the bracelet?

384
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:55,030
Ye Yunkai told me about it before.

385
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,350
Bai Li would never tell

386
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,110
Ye Yunkai so much about me.

387
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,740
I'm not sure either.

388
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,270
Today,

389
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,030
you surprised me.

390
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:17,570
You didn't use any dirty tricks to impress Mr. Feng.

391
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,830
Instead, you did it my way, thank you.

392
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,030
We're partners after all.

393
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,560
I also want to thank you.

394
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:36,950
I promise

395
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,510
to work with you.

396
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,880
I know you're doing this to take revenge on Ye Yunkai,

397
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,340
but you also helped Bai Li.

398
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,610
You gave me your sincerity,

399
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,170
and I gave you mine.

400
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,250
Also,

401
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,020
you showed me a different side of you.

402
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:58,150
Then what kind of person do you think I am now?

403
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,230
I'm not sure.

404
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,510
Maybe this version of you

405
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,590
is the one wearing a mask.

406
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,230
Su Yu, actually...

407
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,400
What’s wrong?

408
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,150
Nothing.

409
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,310
I wanted to say,

410
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,630
no matter which version you see,

411
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,280
don't believe in it too easily.

412
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,800
Because sometimes,

413
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,980
what you see may not be the truth.

414
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,650
What do you mean?

415
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,310
You should store the silver bracelet,

416
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,840
and give it to the person you want to give it to.

417
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,200
Bai Li,

418
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,990
you've been sleeping for too long.

419
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,800
I know,

420
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,830
it must be because

421
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,190
there are things and people that you don't want to face in this world.

422
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,190
That's why you don't want to wake up.

423
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,230
It's okay,

424
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,630
you should rest well.

425
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,100
I'll deal with them for you,

426
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:32,930
and seek justice for you.

427
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,210
No matter which version of me you see,

428
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,720
don't believe in it too easily.

429
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,350
Because sometimes,

430
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,430
what you see may not be the truth.

431
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,580
Ning Mochen is different from who she used to be.

432
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,990
The her right now,

433
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,880
is more valuable.

434
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:58,070
Joining hands with her will make it easier for me to reach my goal.

435
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,270
Bai Li,

436
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,350
I should have given this to you back in college.

437
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,960
But it's not too late now.

438
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,150
Let this bracelet

439
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,160
protect you in my place,

440
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:15,970
and accompany you.

441
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,470
Get well soon.

442
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:25,840
[Chenyun Jewelry Co., Ltd.]

443
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,480
As soon as we get Mr. Feng's authorization,

444
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,230
immediately cooperate with Marketing

445
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,180
to build a campaign.

446
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,310
Then, we'll launch the new products, understand?

447
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,040
Yes, congratulations, Mr. Ye.

448
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:44,820
Hello, Mr. Feng.

449
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,350
It's me.

450
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,510
Stop the authorization?

451
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,640
You go out first.

452
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,560
Okay.

453
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,600
Mr. Feng, why?

454
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,500
Mr. Feng, think about Bai Li.

455
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,740
What? Su Yu went to see you?

456
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,190
Mr. Feng, please reconsider.

457
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,390
Hello?

458
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,230
Hello?

459
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,550
What a rare guest.

460
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,650
We didn't even invite you,

461
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,050
yet you came by yourself.

462
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,330
Moxi, what are you talking about?

463
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,270
Chen is also family,

464
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,830
so of course she should come home often.

465
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,510
We can't let others think

466
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,970
you are the only daughter of the Ning family.

467
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,820
I came back to tell you that

468
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,110
Su Yu has agreed to cooperate with Ningmei.

469
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,010
So soon?

470
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,590
What's wrong?

471
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,650
Are you surprised?

472
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:08,090
Or do you not want Su Yu to agree?

473
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,630
No way,

474
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,510
I'm just curious why he agreed so soon.

475
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,670
Whether or not one is Ning family's daughter

476
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:17,870
isn't determined by how long she stays in the Ning family,

477
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:20,270
but by how useful she is.

478
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,390
Right?

479
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,930
Honey, didn't I say?

480
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,410
I said Chen can definitely do it.

481
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:31,640
From now on, the Ning family will need to rely on Chen.

482
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:32,990
Chen,

483
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,820
you have to teach your sister in the future.

484
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,230
When everything is uncertain,

485
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,830
I only believe in the result.

486
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,040
After signing the contract,

487
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,570
Ningmei Jewelry will always have your place.

488
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:51,710
Yes.

489
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,980
Ye Yunkai.

490
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,840
Seeing how you're in such a good mood,

491
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,350
I guess you've made a deal with Mr. Feng.

492
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,470
The deal with Mr. Feng is off.

493
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:36,690
I thought this deal was secured?

494
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,550
You should go ask your fiancé.

495
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,030
Su Yu?

496
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,370
What’s wrong with him?

497
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,110
Stop acting like you don't know.

498
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,630
Mr. Feng suddenly changed his mind.

499
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:00,750
He said he’s working with Su Yu.

500
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,770
You weren't the one behind this?

501
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,110
If I had such ability,

502
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,580
why would I help Su Yu?

503
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,460
I would've asked Mr. Feng to cooperate with Ningmei,

504
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,180
so that way, my dad will respect me more.

505
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:25,600
Chen,

506
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,750
are you going to leave me?

507
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,030
I know,

508
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,030
in your heart,

509
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,130
I'm a scumbag who betrayed his family.

510
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,950
So you never took my feelings for you seriously.

511
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,790
But it's because I care for this family too much,

512
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,360
so I became like this.

513
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,580
What do you mean?

514
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,150
From the day I got married,

515
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,270
Bai Li's father

516
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,960
never looked at me.

517
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,670
Bai Li went through a lot of pressure

518
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,480
to be with me.

519
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,080
I feel sorry for her.

520
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,470
I feel sorry that she's shamed in her family.

521
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:32,420
So in that moment I swore to myself

522
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,710
that I'd become something great.

523
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,870
I wanted Bai Li to drive a good car.

524
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,110
I wanted her to live in a good house.

525
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:49,300
I wanted her friends and family

526
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,420
to all envy her.

527
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,360
To all be jealous of her.

528
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,560
I wanted everyone to know that Bai Li

529
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,460
made the right choice to marry me.

530
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:08,740
But,

531
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,040
I focused too much on work.

532
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,290
When I'm outside, I would act dumb,

533
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:19,840
and smile along.

534
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,910
She doesn't know

535
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,900
how much I suffered.

536
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,510
I couldn't tell her.

537
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,860
Just like that,

538
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,590
Bai Li and I

539
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,480
started drifting apart.

540
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,080
Chen,

541
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,030
do you understand?

542
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,480
It's not easy for me either.

543
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,780
Stop acting.

544
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:09,390
You say it's for Bai Li, and for family.

545
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,560
But it's actually all for yourself.

546
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,170
You're the one who doesn't want to be looked down upon.

547
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:18,410
You're the one who wants to drive a luxury car and live in a luxury house.

548
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:21,010
Bai Li has never mentioned these things to you.

549
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,070
Maybe the old Bai Li

550
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,710
would believe in your tales,

551
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,790
and believe that you did all this for her.

552
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,310
But now,

553
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,380
she won't believe it.

554
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,330
Never.

555
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,440
So stop using Bai Li as an excuse.

556
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:46,590
You're simply a despicable scum.

557
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,430
Ning Mochen,

558
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,630
you actually have a sense of justice.

559
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,040
Who are you to criticize me?

560
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,650
Just because I lost Mr. Feng,

561
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,320
and lost the chance to work with Ningmei Jewelry,

562
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,890
you're going to abandon me,

563
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,460
and go become

564
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,360
Mrs. Su?

565
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,560
What do you think?

566
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,350
Chen,

567
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,370
looks like you've forgotten,

568
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,850
but I have something to use against you.

569
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,940
I'm sure there's a lot.

570
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,390
So,

571
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,550
even if I tell Ning Zhaoxiong

572
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,050
that you used my other company to transfer money,

573
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,290
you wouldn't care?

574
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,430
This Ning Mochen,

575
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,640
keeps getting me into trouble.

576
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:03,140
What will happen if Ning Zhaoxiong finds out?

577
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,560
Will he cut ties with you?

578
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,320
Send you abroad?

579
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,750
Or,

580
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:14,070
will he give your assets to your sister?

581
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,380
What?

582
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,730
Are you afraid?

583
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,380
Ye Yunkai,

584
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,010
I think you've lost your head from getting mad at Su Yu.

585
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,080
What good will it do to you

586
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,440
if you destroy me?

587
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:34,690
Don't forget,

588
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,690
I'm your trump card to working with Ningmei.

589
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,270
Then did you help me?

590
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,440
You are engaged to Su Yu,

591
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,710
so you don't even care about me.

592
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,630
What can I do?

593
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,140
Don't forget that you have a wife.

594
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,390
You had one, and you still do.

595
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,180
Alright, stop drinking.

596
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,330
As long as we work together,

597
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,000
you'll be able to join hands with Ningmei sooner or later.

598
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:11,630
There is even

599
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,970
the possibility

600
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,010
of me swallowing Ningmei for you.
