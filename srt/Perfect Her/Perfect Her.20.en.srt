I haven't been in a stable state lately?

After it's done,

she'll give me a sum of money

112

to make up for all the losses I suffered in prison.

113
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,190

No, no, Chen.

117
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,870
How can I ask you for money?

118
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,470
What do you want then?

119
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,270

the first time I saw you.

124
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,470
How could I

125
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,830
let a perfect person like you

126
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,870
go to hell with me?

127
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,150
Don't worry.

128
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,710
I'll carry all the burden myself

129
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,990
and let you say goodbye to your past.

130
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,910

But on one condition.

You have to spend one night with me.

134
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,680
How could you possibly let me go so easily?

135

Everyone says I'm crazy.

136
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,390
But

137
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,230
I just stopped being afraid.

138
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,070
I've lost everything once.

the most important thing

141
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,500
is to live in the moment.

142
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,830
Let me think about it.

143
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,990
Okay.

144
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,830

Why are you dressed like...

Every moment of the night is precious.

Of course not.

What do you mean?

162
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,730
That was the first year after we got married.

163
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,230
On October 23,

164

you said you didn't want me to work too hard,

166
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,610
and asked me to quit my job and stay at home.

167
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,320
Honey, the company is taking off.

168
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,550
You can trust yourself with me.

169
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,390
I swear.

I, Ye Yunkai,

171
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,070

172
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,750
Since then,

173
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,390
my life has only been

174
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,230
about you all the time.

175
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,230
I became your nanny,

176
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,150
servant, and assistant.

177
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,510
I always thought

178
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,470
you loved me.

179
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,390
And I love you too.

180
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,680
That's why I did all that for the person I love.

181
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,910
It was worth it,

182
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,450
even if I had to suffer a bit.

183
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,590
But

until

185
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,990
our 10th wedding anniversary.

186
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,470
I saw with my own eyes

187
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,330
what you did with Ning Mochen.

188
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,950
That image kept replaying in my mind.

189
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,080
I suddenly realized

190
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,910
I had been dreaming for a long time.

191
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,430
That day,

192
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,360
I finally woke up.

193
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,910
I saw a real world,

194
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,190
and a real you.

195
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,710
I didn't expect

196
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,550
when my body was in a coma,

197
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,950
you were still using her

198
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,490
and exploiting the last bit of her value.

199
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,670
You even got so greedy that

200
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,030
you wanted to kill me.

201
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,870
Ye Yunkai.

202
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,310
Look into my eyes.

203
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,190
Tell me.

204
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,150
Who am I? Who am I?

205
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,630
You and Bai Li are such a perfect match.

206
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,690
In the end, she still chose Ye Yunkai.

207
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,910
She gave up her dream and career

208
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,150
for Ye Yunkai.

209
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:38,000
If Ye Yunkai comes back to her,

210
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,440
what do you think she'll choose?

211
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,640
Why are you here?

212
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,350
Where is she?

213
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,070
Honey.

214
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,830
Aren't you upstairs?

215
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,590
Good.

216
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,350
Everyone is here.

217
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,310
How did you know?

218
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,790
So what if you knew?

219
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,350
Everything Ye Yunkai and I did

220
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,320
will become your problem to deal with.

221
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,580
Actually, I should

222
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,590
thank you for this.

223
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,740
[Yang Guang]

224
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,270
Yang Guang?

225
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,350
Hello?

226
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,190
Chen, this is Yang Guang.

227
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,470
What's up?

228
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:01,070
Bai Li wants to use the fact that you and Ye Yunkai embezzled Ningmei's money against you.

229
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,000
But don't worry.

230
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,270
I'm the actual controller of Ningmei now.

231
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,990
I've solved this problem for you.

232
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,390
Consider it my engagement gift for you.

233
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,190
I wish you happiness.

234
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,320
What do you mean?

235
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,760
Do you remember

236
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,270
the shares you exchanged for the bracelet?

237
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,830
All the debts of that company

238
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,950
have been transferred to you through the shares.

239
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,870
This is just a pile of wastepaper now.

240
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,830
It can no longer threaten us.

241
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:31,800
Ning Mochen.

242
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,120
Don't forget my warning to you.

243
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,460
I'm a man of my word.

244
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,940
You will end up like Ning Zhaoxiong

245
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,110
and be left with nothing.

246
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,990
What on earth is going on?

247
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:53,000
[Marketing Management Center]

248
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:53,000
[Audit and Supervision Center]

249
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:53,000
[Executive Office]

250
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,120
Hello. Song Yu, keep an eye on two people for me.

251
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,590
Observe what they do

252
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,120
and who they meet every day.

253
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,190
One is Bai Li,

254
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,290
and the other is Ye Yunkai.

255
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,440
Hello, Boss.

256
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,200
I found something.

257
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,910
According to Song Yu,

258
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,130
Ye Yunkai was sent by Ning Mochen.

259
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,710
According to their plan,

260
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,310
they'll first send me away,

261
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,829
and then ask Ye Yunkai to see you alone.

262
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,190
Let’s play along then.

263
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,030
Go see Ning Mochen.

264
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
I'll stay here and lead Ye Yunkai on,

265
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:21,430
make him admit that Ning Mochen is behind this,

266
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,349
and force her to stop.

267
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,160
I disagree.

268
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,839
It's too dangerous for you to confront Ye Yunkai.

269
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,300
They have no idea that you've recognized me.

270
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,069
So,

271
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,430
this is our best chance to fight back.

272
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,800
And I'll ask Jiang to stay in the next room.

273
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,170
Nothing will go wrong.

274
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,910
Ye Yunkai, get up!

275
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,070
Is this how you did my task?

276
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,040
Honey, are you my wife?

277
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,750
What are you talking about?

278
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,790
Get out, Ning Mochen!

279
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,600
What did he call you?

280
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,050
Look carefully.

281
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,080
Look at her face carefully.

282
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,190
She is Ning Mochen.

283
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,440
It's her.

284
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,120
She seduced you

285
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,650
and toyed with you,

286
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,350
and made you a scumbag everyone despises.

287
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,270
It's also her who toyed with you

288
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,360
and ruined the career you spent 10 years building.

289
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,440
I worked so hard to save you.

290
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,670
Now it's still her.

291
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,990
She's acting,

292
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,960
so that you can never get back on your feet.

293
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,190
Tell me.

294
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,710
Tell me who she is.

295
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:36,750
Ning Mochen.

296
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,670
Who is she?

297
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,590
Ning Mochen!

298
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,150
Do you remember Rich River?

299
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:46,150
They say if you make a wish to Rich River,

300
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,430
you'll be rich for a lifetime.

301
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,870
Honey, you know what?

302
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,800
I used to come here often

303
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,190
with my dad when I was little.

304
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,670
He said this river is called Rich River.

305
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:02,390
Honey.

306
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,910
I will make a lot of money

307
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,950
and make you

308
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,570
the happiest woman in this world.

309
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,540
Do you

310
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,470
remember who I am now?

311
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,190
You are...

312
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,750
You are Bai Li.

313
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,790
Then take a close look

314
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,790
and see who the woman behind you is.

315
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,750
Ning Mochen.

316
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,150
It's you.

317
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,710
It's not me. It's not me.

318
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,960
It's always been you.

319
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,030
Are you crazy?

320
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,360
You bitch!

321
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,270
How's it going, you two?

322
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,200
I've been waiting here for a while.

323
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,310
Bai Li.

324
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,830
You decide

325
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,930
whether we should leave them there to die or not.

326
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,390
Ning Mochen.

327
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,490
Ning Mochen, you won't get away with this.

328
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,110
Don't come over!

329
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,430
I'm not Ning Mochen!

330
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,590
You fell.

331
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,000
I’m not Ning Mochen.

332
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,790
Ning Mochen, listen.

333
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,070
You only have yourself to blame.

334
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,150
You vicious woman.

335
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,870
You made me like this.

336
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,270
We'll both go to hell!

337
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,750
Ye Yunkai, are you done?

338
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,470
I'll tell you one last time.

339
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,840
You only have yourself to blame

340
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,350
that you ended up like this.

341
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,790
I'll tell you one last time.

342
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,710
Bai Li?

343
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,270
I...

344
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,110
No!

345
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,160
Don't come over.

346
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,070
Don't kill me!

347
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,240
Don't kill me!

348
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:29,710
Ning Mochen.

349
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,790
Everything is over.

350
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,350
I'll give you one last chance.

351
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,510
Disappear from our world.

352
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:43,790
This way,

353
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:48,320
we'll have nothing to do with each other anymore.

354
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,750
Let me go.

355
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,310
Let me go.

356
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,230
You're still so naïve.

357
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,190
Listen.

358
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,020
I failed to kill you this time.

359
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,790
I'll definitely kill you next time.

360
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,110
Let's go.

361
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,270
Stop!

362
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,430
Who are you to look down on me?

363
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,030
Why do you look down on me?

364
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,230
Bai Li.

365
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,150
Do you want to

366
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,020
live in my body for a lifetime?

367
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,310
Fine.

368
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,340
What are you doing?

369
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:21,070
Then say goodbye

370
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,550
to your body forever.

371
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:36,400
Bai Li!

372
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,550
Wake up, Senior.

373
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,150
Bai Li.

374
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:10,270
Bai Li!

375
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,110
Bai Li!

376
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:15,590
Bai Li!

377
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:20,990
Su Yu?

378
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,330
Where's the music from?

379
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,270
Look for it.

380
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,830
When did you make a pair of this?

381
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,050
When you were ignoring me.

382
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:23,990
I'm sorry.

383
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,310
Last time,

384
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,590
I gave you a ring for no reason.

385
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:31,550
I thought if I give it a little more sense of ritual this time,

386
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,350
you wouldn't turn me down again.

387
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,550
The Möbius strip means...

388
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,970
You're not only my beginning,

389
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,830
but also my ending.

390
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,030
No matter where we start,

391
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:54,760
♫If parting is an illness♫

392
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,170
we'll always meet each other.

393
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:02,790
♫Then you're the irreplaceable cure♫

394
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,190
I enlarged the size of the ring.

395
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,470
This way, you won't feel restrained.

396
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:10,290
♫You're the only one I care about in this crowded city♫

397
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,840
Your love will never make me feel restrained.

398
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,190
Let's give it a name.

399
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:17,870
♫I'm determined to have my heartbeat get closer to yours♫

400
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,760
Let's call it

401
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,270
Begin with the First Encounter.

402
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,560
♫You say love is like♫

403
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:27,670
♫A rainstorm that wind can't blow away♫

404
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:33,490
♫No matter how it hysterically♫

405
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,070
Chen.

406
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,030
As a psychologist,

407
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,650
I exposed your privacy,

408
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,580
♫Calls out someone's name♫

409
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,950
and my license has been revoked.

410
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,670
Zhao Si is suspected of intentional assault

411
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,470
and has been punished by the law.

412
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,310
And all your illegal behaviors

413
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,750
will also be punished accordingly.

414
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,630
But don't worry.

415
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,470
When you wake up,

416
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,490
I'll face everything with you.

417
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,270
She never responded.

418
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,910
What did the doctor say?

419
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,170
If she doesn't wake up in three months,

420
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,190
she'll be diagnosed as a vegetable.

421
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,670
What do you plan to do?

422
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,690
I've decided not to go abroad.

423
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,250
I'll stay here with her.

424
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:20,070
The doctor said if I talk to her more,

425
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,430
she might hear me.

426
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,790
Ms. Bai.

427
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,370
You fell into the water again.

428
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,720
Are there any sequelae?

429
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,670
I'm okay. No abnormalities.

430
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,150
Now I understand everything I've experienced

431
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,790
is not for resisting anything,

432
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,910
but to learn to be ingenuous.

433
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,200
We will accept some arrangements of fate.

434
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,630
That's right.

435
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,390
Every one of us

436
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,550
has a fate to accept.

437
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,350
We should

438
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,490
accept it bravely.

439
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,060
Senior, rest early.

440
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,270
I'll be right next door.

441
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,870
Call me if you need anything.

442
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,230
Su Yu.

443
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,430
Can you stay here with me?

444
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,720
When you kiss me,

445
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,110
will you think of her?

446
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,350
Wait for me.

447
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:05,830
Senior.

448
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,670
Stop calling me Senior.

449
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,840
Call me by my name.

450
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:14,510
Bai Li.

451
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:35,630
I know

452
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,610
the special meaning of a ring to love.

453
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,510
It ties

454
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:44,560
the destiny and feelings of two people together.

455
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,990
I gave it to you

456
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,710
not to imprison you,

457
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,150
but to tell you

458
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,630
whether you wear it or take it off,

459
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:58,070
you'll always have the right to choose.

460
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:58,990
Bai Li.

461
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,240
Maybe you're used to giving for others,

462
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,350
but I hope you can

463
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:11,000
do more things for yourself in the future.

464
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,670
Don't worry.

465
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,910
Do whatever you want.

466
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,910
I'll always have your back.

467
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,590
This is the transfer contract of the bar.

468
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,390
Mr. Su's legal department has checked it.

469
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:31,250
This bar will be yours from now on.

470
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,440
I have something to do. I have to go.

471
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,280
Ning Mochen.

472
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,800
Ning Mochen, why are you here?

473
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:47,950
Cha Cha.

474
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,270
Your new bar is so pretty.

475
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,190
Thank you.

476
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:57,310
Since you're here,

477
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,790
sit and have a cup of coffee.

478
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,050
No, thanks. I have something to do later.

479
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,110
Cha Cha.

480
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:08,130
This is the new beginning of your career.

481
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:11,150
I hope everything goes well with you in the future.

482
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,710
Thank you.

483
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,160
Ning Mochen.

484
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:21,390
Come here often when you have time.

485
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,710
Welcome to the Financial News.

486
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,150
From various sources,

487
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,420
the former president of Chenyun Jewelry, Ye Yunkai,

488
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,750
had a large amount of unexplained financial transactions

489
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,740
with Ningmei Jewelry.

490
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,470
After investigation,

491
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,510
the two companies are suspected of illegal fundraising

492
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,070
and commercial fraud.

493
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:47,110
Compulsory measures have been taken on

494
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:50,110
Ye Yunkai and relevant employees of Ningmei Jewelry.

495
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:53,690
[Six months later]

496
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,950
Mr. Su.

497
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:59,150
You're holding another design exhibition after six months' rest

498
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,670
and you'll launch your new work in the exhibition.

499
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,080
It's a pair of rings you designed

500
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,110
with your other half, Ms. Ning.

501
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,710
This ring

502
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,270
is inspired by flying birds and the sky.

503
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:11,909
It symbolizes the courage to pursue happiness.

504
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:12,750
Ms. Ning.

505
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,429
As a person with a dark history

506
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,030
who's quite controversial,

507
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:16,980
what gave you the courage

508
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,239
to appear in front of the audience again?

509
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,969
I can't change what happened in the past.

510
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,270
But I hope you can look forward

511
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,550
to my future.

512
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:27,750
This pair of rings you designed with Mr. Su

513
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,710
is indeed favored by young people.

514
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:33,429
Can you tell me the origin of your design?

515
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:37,070
I experienced major life changes in the past,

516
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,030
and I had a lot of fear.

517
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,750
But after hitting my low point,

518
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,989
I became braver.

519
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:46,110
The wings symbolize the faith of female independence.

520
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,630
Only when women love themselves more

521
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,690
can they have wings flying to the sky.

522
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,770
What about you, Mr. Su?

523
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:55,110
Was this design led by you?

524
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:55,909
Or

525
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:58,550
did you just work on Ms. Ning's design concept?

526
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,790
It doesn't matter who led the design.

527
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,390
We simply inspire each other

528
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,880
and support each other.

529
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,030
Sometimes she guides me,

530
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,350
and sometimes I inspire her.

531
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,900
We've been through so much together.

532
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,200
We're both very helpful to each other.

533
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,080
Shakespeare once said that

534
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,440
jewelry is silent,

535
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:20,110
yet it's more touching than any language.

536
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,870
And today, I also want to take this opportunity to tell you

537
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,670
that we are about to get married.

538
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,120
Please support us.

539
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,710
Congratulations.

540
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:31,030
Your relationship is really enviable.

541
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,000
Do you have anything to say

542
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,190
to the young people who want romance?

543
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,350
Believe in love.

544
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,070
Grow together.

545
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:55,830
Although soul switching sounds unbelievable,

546
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:57,800
I believe

547
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,910
the life I got through this switch

548
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,310
is real.

549
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,670
The past 10 years

550
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,110
is more like a dream instead.

551
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,350
Fortunately,

552
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,850
after waking up from my dream,

553
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,880
you're still the one by my side.

554
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:23,840
Life seems to still be full of infinite possibilities of happiness.

555
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,310
I'm still looking forward to the future.

556
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,830
Our future.

557
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,510
Our future.

558
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,230
That's the last chapter.

559
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,470
You decide

560
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,710
whether you want to publish it or not.

561
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,770
That's how it ends?

562
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,750
It's too sudden.

563
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,150
Actually, creation is like life.

564
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,470
You have to have regrets

565
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,750
to have more expectations for the future.

566
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,300
What about the secret logic you mentioned before?

567
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,550
It's the fate of the two heroines.

568
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,060
Didn't you notice?

569
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,910
Actually, after they woke up,

570
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:18,040
they experienced the same incidents.

571
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:21,630
In fact, it's the process of breaking down to rebuilding yourself.

572
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,230
It's the same for all of us.

573
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,400
After a huge setback,

574
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,150
how to face a new life

575
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,110
is what we should learn the most.

576
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:29,790
Isn't it?

577
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,950
Alright, Boss.

578
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,990
I'm tired after this series.

579
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,900
It's time for me to take a break.

580
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,600
Where are you going?

581
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,650
I haven't decided yet.

582
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,550
I'm leaving.

583
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:43,790
Bye.

584
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,310
Ai.

585
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,410
Let's go together.

586
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:54,780
Sure.
