[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,910
I did all of this for you.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,510
What else do you want me to do?

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,790
To kill you

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,270
at the right time.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,630
You won't have the chance to hurt me anymore.

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,020
You must sign this today.

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,760
You love my wife so much.

9
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,360
If anything happens to her,

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,910
my custody will be useless.

11
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,570
What will I threaten you with?

12
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,280
You

13
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,460
love Bai Li?

14
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:30,390
Yes.

15
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,380
What are you doing?

16
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,110
I want to do something exciting,

17
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,840
something Su Yu can't give you.

18
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,670
This love triangle

19
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,870
is not bad.

20
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,070
Right?

21
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,030
But

22
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,550
the main female character keeps flirting with Ye Yunkai

23
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,030
for no reason.

24
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,350
Can you stop using this trick?

25
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,630
I'm sick of it.

26
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,670
Did you write it with your feet?

27
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,670
Are there no other tricks to use?

28
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,400
That's her characterization.

29
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,990
It's already hard for her to act as the supporting character.

30
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,520
You have to understand her.

31
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,840
What if someone suspects her?

32
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,879
So what if someone does?

33
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,510
What would be the consequences?

34
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,310
Are you saying that if others guess it,

35
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,550
she'll panic?

36
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,510
It... It indeed does not make sense.

37
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,030
Explain.

38
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,289
I need an explanation.

39
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,150
Maintaining the characterization is the best explanation.

40
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,030
So you don't need logic if you have characterization?

41
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,430
Didn't you say that

42
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,860
we don't need to be logical for a feel-good story?

43
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,910
Are you dissing me?

44
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,310
-Did you diss me again?
-No.

45
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,430
-You did.
-You...

46
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,080
-You won't get the final payment.
-No.

47
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,780
I'll go.

48
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,520
I'm working so hard.

00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:05,140
[Perfect Her]

[Episode 10]

51
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,540
Su Yu?

52
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,680
I’m just here to get something.

53
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,690
Have a drink with me.

54
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,990
Consider it a celebration for your senior escaping danger.

55
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,880
I hope she wakes up soon.

56
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,110
Su Yu,

57
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,550
I have a question.

58
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,430
When did you

59
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,320
fall in love with your senior?

60
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,080
I mean no harm.

61
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,960
Since you love her so much,

62
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,580
I'm just curious why.

63
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,240
Actually, I think

64
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,790
everyone who has met her

65
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,790
would like her.

66
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,440
After all, she is so beautiful.

67
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,150
Since the first time I saw her...

68
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,550
At that time,

69
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,580
I was very unlikeable.

70
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,640
I didn't have any friends in school.

71
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,510
She was the only one

72
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,270
who approached me

73
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,930
and cared about me.

74
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,510
Sometimes,

75
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,240
I thought she could see what I was thinking with one glance,

76
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,670
but she never exposed me.

77
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,920
Instead, she carefully protected

78
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,790
my ego,

79
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,720
my sensitivity,

80
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,700
and even my darkness.

81
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,150
What's wrong?

82
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,510
Actually, you can use another technique.

83
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,360
It can save you some effort.

84
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,190
I was like this before too.

85
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,450
I easily hurt my hands.

86
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,640
Actually, look—

87
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,320
You didn't introduce yourself at freshman registration.

88
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,360
What’s your name?

89
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,070
Su... Su Yu.

90
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,190
Su... Su Yu?

91
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,830
It’s Su Yu.

92
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,750
Oh.

93
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,030
Su Yu,

94
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,310
we will work together in the future.

95
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,050
Let's work hard together.

96
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,310
In my heart,

97
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,590
she was always a reliable and kind senior.

98
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,750
I liked her

99
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,460
and respected her.

100
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,310
Every time I saw her,

101
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,120
I was very, very happy.

102
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,310
Maybe in her heart,

103
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,720
I was just a junior who would never grow up.

104
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,340
Because of her,

105
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,570
I gradually found the fun of designing jewelry.

106
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,190
Her philosophy has always inspired me.

107
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,830
You could say that I wouldn't be here now

108
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,430
without her.

109
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,670
Why do you look unhappy when you work?

110
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,750
Don't you enjoy the creation process?

111
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,010
What's there to enjoy?

112
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,630
Of course there are things.

113
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,750
Creation is a very happy process.

114
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,240
What's happy about it?

115
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:55,270
Jewelry

116
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,600
is often worn by someone

117
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,590
at their most important

118
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,030
moment or occasion.

119
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,850
It witnesses a person's life.

120
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,390
Isn't it exciting

121
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,520
to create something like this?

122
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,330
It's something you put everything into completing.

123
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,740
You turn your ideas

124
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,270
and emotions

125
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,910
into specific lines,

126
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,150
patterns,

127
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,790
and shapes.

128
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,650
Don't you think it's interesting?

129
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,790
She helped me so much.

130
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,150
But

131
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,870
I couldn't repay anything to her.

132
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,320
Don't say that.

133
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,679
You've done a lot for her.

134
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,750
Actually...

135
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,840
Actually, I'm quite silly.

136
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,950
I secretly liked her for a long time,

137
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,630
but I never told her.

138
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,230
I always thought

139
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,600
she would always accompany me.

140
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,390
I didn't know

141
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,350
it was just my wishful thinking.

142
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,890
Maybe we had no results

143
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,720
from the beginning.

144
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,030
No matter how hard I try,

145
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,030
nothing will change.

146
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,530
It's not like that.

147
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,520
Love requires courage.

148
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,120
But I'm too weak.

149
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,840
I don't deserve her love.

150
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,230
You're not weak at all.

151
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,750
You know how to love better than anyone else.

152
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,400
What do you know?

153
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,370
What about you?

154
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,830
Do you have someone you love?

155
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,350
Yes.

156
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,270
Now,

157
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,990
there's someone I love very much.

158
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,310
I know

159
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,270
he can give up everything for me

160
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,830
and I

161
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,480
am willing to sacrifice everything for him too.

162
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,430
Now,

163
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,670
it's my turn to do something for him.

164
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,460
What do you mean?

165
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,390
Nothing.

166
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:19,560
You're here.

167
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,630
I'm in Ning Mochen's body.

168
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,400
I can’t open the fingerprint lock at home.

169
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,430
Otherwise,

170
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,650
I wouldn't have to put on an act with Ye Yunkai anymore.

171
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,210
I don't need it.

172
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,430
Let's go upstairs directly.

173
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,790
What are you doing here?

174
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,870
I'm here to catch the adulterers,

175
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,030
you pair of unfaithful and vixen-like

176
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,860
adulterers!

177
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,230
Don't slander me!

178
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,750
Let me in if you dare.

179
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:22,560
This is my house.

180
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,850
Why should I let you in?

181
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,950
If you are so capable, let me go in and have a look.

182
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,110
Do you dare? Stop messing around.

183
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,570
I dare you to push me again.

184
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,990
I'm telling you. Ning Mochen must be inside.

185
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,520
You're just acting guilty.

186
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,280
Move!

187
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,030
Get out of the way!

188
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,030
This is my house. Why should I move?

189
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,110
Fine. You don't have to let me in.

190
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,110
Make her come out.

191
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,270

00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:09,080
to get Senior's designs

559
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,090
and Ye Yunkai's recording.

560
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,400
Ning Mochen,

561
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,950
I don't know

562
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:16,030
why you helped Bai Li,

563
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:19,760
but thank you this time.

564
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,310
I should thank you all.

565
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,670
Thank you for saving me.

566
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,050
Saving you?

567
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:32,650
Oh.

568
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,220
Ye Yunkai went mad,

569
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:37,110
so he can't carry out the custody.

570
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,090
You should be able to

571
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:42,250
transfer Bai Li's custody away from him successfully.

572
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,830
Now, she's finally safe.

573
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,620
You two protected her.
