Call me Dad.

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,530
How can you accomplish big things without being ruthless?

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,710
Your dear senior is still my wife.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,590
Why are you doing this?

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,550
People die for money. Birds die for food.

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,190
This is Mr. Su’s design.

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,280
It seems to have more of a feminine touch.

10
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,710
The meal and the hospital took up half of this chapter.

11
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,150
It's not necessary to use all the space

12
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,430
to explain the main male character's difficulties.

13
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,430
I'll say it again.

14
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,750
The main male character's revenge target is the female's father.

15
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,270
Just wait.

16
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,780
It's the darkness before dawn.

17
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,200
It's the rising action.

18
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,350
You mean the main characters won't open their mouths

19
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,680
and can't say anything?

20
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,289
Boss, look.

21
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,140
For example, we don't have a very good relationship.

22
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,310
So tell me,

23
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,370
even if your impression of me changes after a long time,

24
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,550
will you believe everything I say?

25
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:26,590
Of course...

26
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,190
I won't.

27
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,590
But I can test you.

28
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,830
If you don't believe me, what's the use of testing?

29
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,470
Does the main female character believe in the male character?

30
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,590
Why won't she ask him directly for help

31
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,630
and work together?

32
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,690
Isn't that better?

33
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,030
That's right.

34
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,870
That's the next chapter.

35
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,880
Next, next, next.

36
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,070
It's like a drama.

37
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,110
You always tell me it'll be better after episode 4,

38
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,910
it'll be better after episode 8.

39
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,310
Do I have to wait until you finish it all before it's good?

40
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,110
Boss,

41
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,750
the main female character was hurt before.

42
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,230
Even in front of her former junior,

43
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,340
she still has to keep things back.

44
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,250
Plus, she can't reveal her identity now.

45
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,430
Keeping a distance is a type of self-protection.

46
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,030
It's like her defense mechanism.

47
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,870
I guess you're the only one who's right.

48
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,600
Of course.

49
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,550
You can go now.

Cha,

57
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,790
I came to ask you a question.

58
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,350
Aren't you busy preparing the wedding with that home-wrecker?

59
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,510
I have nothing to tell you.

60
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,100
You're not welcome here. Please leave.

Su Yu, let me ask you.

63
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,090
Do you not think you've let Bai Li down?

64
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,750
She is still hospitalized and in a coma because of that home-wrecker,

65
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,550
while you went to work with that scumbag Ye Yunkai.

Let me ask you.

67
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:44,970
Does nothing matter when you're faced with interests?

68
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,830
Bai Li used to tell me

69
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,760
that she had a junior named Su Yu,

70
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,550
who was a genius and a good man.

71
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,290
She was very proud of him.

72
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,430
I didn't expect you to not be able to tell right from wrong.

73
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,070
You really let Bai Li down.

74
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,230
Yes,

75
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,830
I did let her down.

76
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,880
You and that bitch Ning Mochen really love acting,

77
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:08,870
but I'm sorry.

78

am no longer a nobody that you can look down on.

You are free now.

188
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,900
that I'm a jerk to you.

189
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,790
That's right.

190
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,810
I'm a jerk.

191
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,200
I abandoned my wife

192
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,270
to pursue you, who is more perfect and powerful.

193
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,890
Was I wrong?

194
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,060
Isn't this how men should be?

195
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:46,240
To pursue higher goals and higher status.

196
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,070
This is how the world is.

197
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,220
Everyone is realistic.

198
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,370
Plus, I didn't let you down.

199
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,640
I've always fulfilled all of your requests.

200
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,150
No matter the time and place,

201
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,150
I've always been there for you.

202
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,590
And for you,

203
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,420
I even abandoned my wife.

204
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,510
For me?

205
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,990
Ye Yunkai,

206
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,350
stop making excuses for yourself.

207
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,770
What excuse?

208
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,970
Look at your father, Ning Zhaoxiong.

209
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,920
He's had so many wives.

210
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,150
Has anyone said anything about him?

211
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:23,910
No,

212
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,390
because he's powerful.

213
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,720
I, Ye Yunkai,

214
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,810
can only become stronger,

215
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:28,510
and stronger,

216
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:28,990
and stronger,

217
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,320
in order for you to think I'm qualified to be with you, right?

218
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,360

219
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,020
I really love you.

220
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:37,810
You love me too,

221
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:39,470
right?

222
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,210
Admit it.

223
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,990
You love me too.

224
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,150
I've done so much for you.

225
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,880
You can't say you don't love me.

226
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,630
I loved you,

227
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,630
but now,

228
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,510
I just feel sorry for you.

229
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,010
You're like a maggot.

230
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,910
You believe the world is rotten,

231
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,830
because only in this way

232
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,840
can you accept your ugly nature.

233
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,470
Ye Yunkai.

234
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,310
Now,

235
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,570
you won't have the chance to hurt me anymore.

236
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,960
Ning Mochen, listen.

00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,430
Countless women will love me in the future.

238
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,690
Don't come crying to me then.

239
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,680
Ye Yunkai didn't keep his promise.

240
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,680
After signing the contract with me,

241
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,180
he refused to hand over your custody.

242
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,770

243
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,930
every day that he doesn't do so.

244
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,040
I suspect he never wanted to hand it over.

245
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,640
Instead, he's already decided

246
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,710
to kill you

247
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,190
at the right time.

248
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,910
But don't worry, Senior.

249
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,240
I knew he would cheat me,

250
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,790
so I have another plan.

251
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,630
Senior.

252
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,220

258
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,190
I'm her junior.

259
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,650
Inform her family to come.

260
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,850
Something happened to her. Come to the hospital.

Why isn't the patient's family here yet?

00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,410
How is the patient?

The patient has been in a coma for too long.

All her bodily functions are deteriorating.

Problems have occurred in her brain.

00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,830
We need surgery now.

273

What will happen if we don't do surgery?

274
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,100
She might never wake up.

275
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,650
Doctor,

276
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,020
what are the risks for this surgery?

277
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,240
Let me put it this way.

278
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,730
This surgery has

279
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,030
around a 20% failure rate,

280
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,150
but if the surgery succeeds,

281
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,030
the patient will maintain the current condition

282
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,070
and might even wake up.

283
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:00,990
Then,

284
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,400
what will happen if it fails?

285
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,910
Her life will be in danger.

286
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,230
This is the agreement.

287
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,000

288
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:20,840

No.

290
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,990
Are you afraid that she'll wake up after the surgery?

291
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,520
What are you talking about?

292
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,070
I'm doing this due to considerations about Bai Li's life.

293
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,400
The doctor just said

294
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,290
the surgery has a 20% chance of failure.

295
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,910
Bai Li can die.

296
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,600
Then should we give up and make her never wake up?

297
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,180
The 20% chance of failure

298
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,550
means there's an 80% chance of success.

299
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,010
I'm not scared of anything

300
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,030
except "if."

302
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,750
I don't think you're afraid of her dying.

303
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,710
You're just afraid that she'll wake up.

304
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,310
Only when she's in a coma

305
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,500

331
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:14,869
Bai Li is not someone who gives up easily.

As long as there is a one percent chance,

333
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,530

Yes.

Using steel to connect the porcelain

Are you using red porcelain?

342
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,270
Red porcelain is extremely difficult to create.

343
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,910
The bold red glaze has low heat resistance,

344
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:49,710
but porcelain

345
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,790
needs to be fired at 1450 degrees to form.

346
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,380
That's right.

347
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,320
That's why they say it's hard for 1,000 kilns to produce one product.

If you keep trying like this,

350
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,470
you won't have any finished products.

351
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,670
Change the material.

352
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,650
Actually, I'm also not confident

353
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,180
that I can make a qualified finished product,

354
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,630

355
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,720
is so mesmerizing.

00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,070
Su Yu is my fiancé.

562
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,020
Isn't it normal for me to know his whereabouts?

563
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,300
Why did you pretend in front of Su Yu yesterday?

564
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,780
You insisted on having Bai Li get surgery.

565
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,600
What,

566
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,600
you were beaten by Su Yu yesterday,

567
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,530
so you're taking it out on me today?

568
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,830
Say that again.

569
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,250
So what if I say it?

570
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,160
You are not as good as Su Yu.

571
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,500
You're inferior in every aspect.

572
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,130
You can say anything,

573
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,220
but you can’t say I’m not as good as Su Yu.

574
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,390
You aren't!

575
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,220
What are you doing?

576
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,240
I want to do something exciting,

577
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,970
something Su Yu can't give you.

578
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,070
Ye Yunkai,

579
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,800
there are so many people here.

580
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,860
Aren't you afraid of ruining your image as a loving husband?

581
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,560
The writers will only arrive after one hour.

582
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,000
I can play the role of a loving husband later.

583
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,340
So, you've always been acting.

584
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,620
You didn't come to visit Bai Li at all.

585
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,410
Bai Li? I can have her die anytime.

586
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,870
How?

587
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,690
Su Yu won’t agree to it.

588
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,680
It'll happen sooner or later after I finish using him.

589
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,710
I still have Bai Li's custody.

590
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:25,790
If I want her to die,

591
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,400
she'll die immediately.

592
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:45,340
What do you mean?

593
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:52,750
We can't do it here.

594
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,000
Tonight,

595
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,820
I'll go to your house.

596
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,930
Ning Mochen,

597
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,270
I knew it.

598
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,890
You and I are the same kind of people.

599
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,460
Ye Yunkai, you scum.

600
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,790
You've destroyed my last bit of feelings for you.

601
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:33,550
I must expose your ugly nature to the public.
