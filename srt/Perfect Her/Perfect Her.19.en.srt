2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,650
You looked into me?

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,110
Why did you pretend to lose your memory?

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,410
Why did you frame her?

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,150
Who are you to judge me?

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,500
Who do you think you are?

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,290
She doesn't have love in her eyes when she looks at Mr. Su.

8
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,110
She doesn't look at Mr. Su the way you do.

9
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,260
When you look at him…

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,120
Of course.

11
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,640
When Mr. Su looks at you, his eyes are full of love too.

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,390
You're just a loser who relies on women to climb up the ladder!

13
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,840
Are you really

14
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,670
my senior, Bai Li?

15
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,590
Boss, good morning.

16
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,470
I'll go get you some coffee.

17
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,030
Wait.

18
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:47,710
Let me ask you.

19
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,630
These people pretended to be threatened

20
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,560
and put on a show.

21
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:51,910
What are they up to?

22
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,610
This way, the plot twist in this episode can be more thrilling.

23
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,670
Yeah, it is thrilling.

24
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:58,590
But…

25
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,490
But it's not logical.

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,080
We don't need logic in the world of comics.

27
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,950
Emotional connections are the most important.

28
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,270
Didn't you tell me that?

29
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,310
When did I say that?

30
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,830
Besides, there's a hidden logic to it.

31
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,030
You'll understand in the next episode.

00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:25,810
Good morning.

35
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,410
Where have you been?

36
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,350
Jiang, your face...

37
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,329
My face?

38
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,579
Jiang Yiheng!

39
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,470
How am I going to do business like this?

40
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,520
Dad has a big turtle on his face!

41
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,410
A big turtle?

42
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,120
I'll…

43
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,110
Sorry.

44
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,870
That's my son, Jiang Yiheng.

45
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,510
I'll go teach him a lesson.

46
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,310
Stop!

47
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,090
Jiang Yishu!

48
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,510
I just changed my pants.

How am I going to do business like this?

50
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,590
Sorry, guys.

00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,130

[Beware of glass]

53
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,390
I have many kids around here.

54
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,589
I wish I could stay here

55
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,070
like this forever.

56
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,160
Stop.

57
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,200

Dad has become a mummy.

59
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,230
Mummy? Haven't I told you

60
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,550
not to waste toilet paper?

61
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:27,910
Stop running.

62
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,670
Stop.

63
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,710
I have to beat you three up today.

64
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,430
Enough, enough.

65
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,550
Listen, the three of you.

66
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,510
Mr. Su, Ms. Ning,

67
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,710
don't defend them.

68
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,590
Enough.

69
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,790
Don't scare the kids.

70
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,420
I've been too lenient with them.

71
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,840
-Here, baby, sit.
-Yishu.

72
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,650
The turtle you drew was great.

73
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,780
I'll draw one too.

74
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,270
Can you rate it for me?

75
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,130
Let's fold paper, shall we?

76
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,150
Do you know how to make a paper plane?

77
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,870
One, two, three, four.

78
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,470
Done.

79
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,200
This is the shell of the turtle.

80
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,550
Mr. Su, Ms. Ning,

81
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,150
you have a way with kids.

82
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,790
The three of them are rarely so quiet.

83
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,950
They're children after all.

84
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,480
It's normal that they're naughty sometimes.

85
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,470
Where is their mom?

86
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,990
Their mom is away for work and barely comes back.

87
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,460
We live separately,

88
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,870
and our four kids stay with me.

89
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,600
Okay.

90
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,920
Are you reminding me to pour tea for them?

91
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,670
Actually,

92
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,590
it's because their mother is not around

93
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,820
and they feel insecure

94
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,790
that they misbehave to attract your attention.

95
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,110
They just want you to love them more.

96
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:37,909
Yeah.

97
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,470
Now that I think about it,

98
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,870
I feel indebted to them.

99
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,030
I failed to take good care of my four kids.

100
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,630
Actually, children play pranks

101
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,350
as a way to understand and explore the world.

102
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,270
Parents just need

103
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,840
to quietly support and care for them

104
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,240
and spend time with them.

105
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,430
Do you agree with Mr. Ning?

106
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,110
I had a good day.

107
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:12,830
Yeah.

108
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,270
I didn't know life was so hard for Jiang.

109
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,550
He has to raise four kids all by himself.

110
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,670
I didn't know you were good with kids.

111
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,340
of course. I like children very much.

112
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,400
You'll definitely be a good father in the future.

113
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,590
How about you?

114
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,390
Do you like children?

115
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,030
Why are you laughing?

116
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,170
Nothing.

117
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,080
All right.

118
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,980

Stay.

00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,200
Are you nervous?

122
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,880
Not very.

123
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,350
I just want to lie with you and chat

124
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,690
until I drift off to sleep.

125
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,390
I feel like I'm dreaming.

126
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:09,910
Su Yu.

127
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,630
What have you been through in the past ten years?

128
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,190
Can you tell me?

129
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,480
Over the past ten years,

130
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,680
I've been to a lot of places.

131
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,950
Where should I start?

132
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,510
Switzerland,

133
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,910
France,

134
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,150
or Spain?

135
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,770
I want to hear them all.

136
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,110
Tell me one by one.

137
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,770
I can't finish them one night.

138
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,909
Then let's spend a lot of nights chatting.

139
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,790
At first, I went to Switzerland

140
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,680
and ran a small business.

141
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,870
Later, I came back…

142
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,450
Hello, Yang Guang.

143
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,650

144
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,000
on the matter we talked about last time we met?

145
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,870
Also,

146
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,670
have you taken care of Ning Mochen's negative news?

147
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,390
Okay.

148
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,590
Stick to the plan.

00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,250
Why did you call Yang Guang?

152
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,590
Are you going to get back at Ning Mochen?

153
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,270
You heard it?

154
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,150
I told you,

155
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,770
revenge can't make you happy.

156
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,710
Instead, it'll drag you into the abyss of pain.

157
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,370
Ning Mochen won't stop.

158
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,080
I'm afraid she'll hurt you.

160
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,270
promise me.

161
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,750
Don't get into trouble again, will you?

162
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,390

163
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,590

166
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,710
I thought

167
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,510
you'd never see me again.

168
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,860
It seems that your life

169
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,630
has been a mess recently.

170
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,470
Actually,

171
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,630
I felt really bad

172
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,750
after quarreling with you that day.

173
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,970
I didn't mean it to happen.

174
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,230
I was just blinded by hatred.

175
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,900
I didn't know what I should do.

176
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,510
After pretending to be Bai Li for such a long time,

177
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,370
you're so into the character now,

182
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,660
Now that I know the truth,

183
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,270
you can quit acting.

countless times, haven't you?

189
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,610
Stop lying to yourself.

00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,320
the girl I love

192
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,480
and appreciate

193
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,060
has never been you.

194
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,950
Do you think I pretended to be Bai Li

195
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,510
to get you?

196
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,510
I hate people like you and her

197
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,500
who think love is all.

198
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,070
So disgusting.

199
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,150
Now what?

200
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,680
You've known the truth.

201
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,920
What are you going to do?

202
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,300
I can do a lot of things.

203
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,350
For example,

204
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,710
Yang Guang made you

205
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,730
the president of Ningmei,

206
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,430
so I can ask Yang Guang to fire you.

207
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,510
Yang Guang?

208
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,310
Why should Yang Guang listen to you?

209
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,510
Ningmei is going downhill in your hands.

210
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,590
He's already very dissatisfied with you.

211
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,720
Don't forget that he's a businessman.

212
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,330
He's always interested in my patent.

213
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:47,740
In comparison to me,

214
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,300
you're worthless

215
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,590
to him.

216
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,310
Fine.

217
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,470
Just do what you want.

218
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,760
I don't care anyway.

219
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,770
If one day

220
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,550
you lose everything

221
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,260
and become a defenseless paper tiger,

222
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,790
will you hurt other people again?

223
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,310
You'll just end up like Ning Zhaoxiong,

224
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,940
spending the rest of your life in distress and regret.

225
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,270
But don't worry.

226
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,620
I won't do that

227
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,890
because Bai Li doesn't want me to become that kind of person.

228
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,040
You can never get

229
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,040
what she and I have

230
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,480
in your whole life.

231
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,310
Childish.

232
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,440
In psychology,

233
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,550
there's a famous experiment.

234
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,640
In that experiment,

235
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,630
an actress was arranged to sit by the roadside,

236
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:13,590
and the passers-by were allowed to do anything to her with tools.

237
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,200
Guess what the passers-by did.

238
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,000
It was in public.

239
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,430
I don't think they would go too far.

240
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,090
Everything was fine at first.

241
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,910
They just put a hairpin in her hair

242
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,810
and put on a hat for her.

243
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,590
But later,

244
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:37,630
someone sliced her skin with roses

245
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,030
and whipped her.

246
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,550
Someone burned her with a lighter.

247
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:49,830
In the end, someone pointed a gun at her head.

248
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,210
Fortunately, the gun was taken away in time.

249
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,510
But that actress

250
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,580
bowed to everyone with tears in her eyes.

251
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,990
But those passers-by

252
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,130
ran away

253
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,440
like children who had done something wrong.

254
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,370
That was just a performance.

255
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,710
It proved that

256
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:29,520
allowing others to make decisions for you

257
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,230
might lead them to kill you,

258
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,670
but

259
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,640
standing up and confronting them

260
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,590
could make them fearful and anxious.

261
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,910
It showed how complicated and dark

262
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,670
humanity was.

263
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,670
Are you talking about the experiment or yourself?

264
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,500
Dr. Peng.

265
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,640
Long time no see.

266
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,150
I didn't expect to see you here.

267
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,270
Dr. Peng is a regular here.

268
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,430
You don't look familiar to me, miss.

269
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,470
Is this your first time here?

270
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,960
Maybe I'm a regular here too

271
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,610
and just have changed my face recently.

272
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,740
You're so humorous.

273
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,510
What would you like to drink?

274
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,960
Glenfiddich, please.

275
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:22,990
What a coincidence.

276
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,470
Dr. Peng ordered that too.

277
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,390
But this is the last bottle.

278
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,110
Who should I give it to?

279
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,060
It's okay. We can drink together.

280
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,550
It happens that Dr. Peng is going abroad soon.

281
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,470
It's the last time he drinks here.

282
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,670
Let's wish him a smooth journey.

283
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,270
I'll give you a 20% discount.

284
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,130
In order to avoid me,

285
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,350
you're actually escaping abroad.

286
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,190
It has nothing to do with you.

287
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,520
I just want to go abroad.

288
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,370
I've found a new pastime lately.

289
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,510
What's coming next is going to be really interesting.

290
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,390
Don't you want to stay and watch?

291
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,230
Enjoy yourself.

292
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,990
I'm leaving.

293
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:16,030
Aren't you curious about what I'm going to do?

294
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,460
I'm going to drag everyone

295
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:24,050
into the abyss of misery.

296
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,450
As long as you're happy.

297
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,960
You've stood against me for so long

298
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,750
but still lost in the end.

299
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,190
Ning Mochen.

300
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,270
I admit

301
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,220
that I can't save you

302
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,190
or myself.

303
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,630
Right.

304
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,160
No one can change my mind,

305
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,490
including you.

306
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,870
Take care.

307
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,600
Su Yu.

308
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,560
You're awake.

309
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,510
How long did I sleep?

310
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,110
It must have been a long time

311
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,700
since the last time you slept so well.

312
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,560
Are you hungry?

313
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,230
I'll get you something to eat.

314
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,310
Don't go.

315
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,150
It feels good to see you when I wake up.

316
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,690
Then, I'll be by your side every time you wake up in the future.

317
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:54,790
Really?

318
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:55,870
Of course.

319
00:18:59,280 --> 00:18:59,950
By the way,

320
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,160
I've remodeled this ring.

321
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:16,510
[Services offered: polishing and restoration, custom design]

322
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,550
Mr. Su, nice to see you again.

323
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,470
Tan,

324
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,750
I want to remodel this ring.

325
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,660
Isn't this the ring you bought that day?

326
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,940
Are you really going to remodel it?

327
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,290
I remember that lady spending the whole day here polishing it.

328
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,290
She was so focused

329
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,750
that she didn't even have lunch.

330
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,410
She put a lot of effort into it.

331
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,860
What do you think needs changing?

332
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,630
It's already perfect.

333
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,110
But I want to give it a special meaning.

334
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,130
The Mobius strip?

335
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,920
Does it have a special meaning for you?

336
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,490
This ring…

337
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,920
You once said that

338
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,150
two lines that never intersect,

339
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,980
even after a brief meeting,

340
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,090
will gradually drift apart

341
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,850
due to their different purposes.

342
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,250
But I want to tell you that

343
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,530
two lines that don't intersect

344
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,930
may actually be part of the same line.

345
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,400
Just like this ring.

346
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,310
I remade it into a Mobius ring.

347
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,790
It means

348
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,550
an endless loop,

349
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,500
just like you and me.

350
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,970
The starting point is you.

351
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:46,050
The end is also you.

352
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,160
No matter what happens,

353
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,570
we'll eventually meet again.

354
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,470
Su Yu,

355
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,430
you know what?

356
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,590
When I look at you like this,

357
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,590
everything feels so unreal.

358
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,110
It's like a dream.

359
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,200
I'm so scared

360
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,480
that I'll suddenly wake up from it.

361
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,450
How do you feel now?

362
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,750
I don't think it's enough.

363
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,240
What's wrong?

364
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,820
Sorry, Su Yu.

365
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,840
Should I not have done that?

366
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,550
It's my fault.

367
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,230
Can you go back to your room?

368
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,360
I need some space.

369
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:48,470
Okay.

370
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,550
I'll be next door.

371
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,160
Call me if you need anything.

372
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,330
[Pay your debts]

373
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,870
[Pay your debts]

374
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:32,210
[Pay your debts]

375
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:40,590
It's…

376
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,460
It's them.

377
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,660
No way. This is a new number.

What?

Yes.

384
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,950
You won 20,000 yuan.

385
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,890
20,000 yuan is nothing!

386
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,850
I used to spend 20,000 yuan without blinking.

It's my fault.

402
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,290
I should've been more patient.

I brought it on myself.

504
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,830
It was all my fault.

505
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,190
I was blind back then.

506
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:39,950
I abandoned you.

Don't worry.

533
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,040
I know what to do.

534
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,520
As long as you do as I say,

535
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,030
I can give you

536
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,400
