00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,220
I'm her fiancé.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,670
Mr. Feng, I hope you won't give your authorization Ye Yunkai.

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,670
Mr. Feng suddenly changed his mind.

7
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,400
He said he's working with Su Yu.

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,040
As long as we work together,

9
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,870
you'll be able to join hands with Ningmei sooner or later.

10
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,270
No matter which version of me you see,

11
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,570
don't believe in it too easily.

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,230
There is even the possibility

13
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,450
of me taking over Ningmei for you.

14
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,160
What you see may not be true.

Ning Mochen is different from who she used to be.

16
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,750
She's now more valuable.

17
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,870
In this chapter,

18
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,110
the male lead is highlighted,

19
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,790
and there is also an idea of the ending.

20
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:44,830
From the next chapter,

21
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,670
the female lead will find out the male lead's feelings towards her.

22
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,150
Their relationship will then become more dramatic

23
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,150
and more tangled.

24
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,790
So?

25
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,030
So I brought out the male lead's storyline.

26
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,390
So you're saying

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,880
that they have feelings for each other now?

28
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:03,510
Yeah.

29
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:05,710
Then can Ms. Ai please

30
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,870
give the female lead a voice?

31
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,870
Why doesn't she just tell the male lead?

32
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,200
You're the one that said

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,980
that we need to make this dramatic,

34
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,470
so whenever the female lead wants to tell the truth,

35
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,630
she needs to have a headache, become dizzy, and have a racing heart

36
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:20,950
that prevents her from saying it.

37
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,230
This dramatic?

38
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,789
Yup.

39
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,390
So she's only going to try once?

40
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,030
Shouldn't she try to find a way to let the male lead know?

41
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:28,990
In that case,

42
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,870
our storyline will be focused on

43
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,729
the female lead making the male lead believe in her.

44
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,940
But the female lead's main purpose is to get revenge,

45
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:40,160
it doesn't matter whether the male lead knows or not.

Do you know how important this is to me?

52
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,750

83

Since the engagement happened so suddenly,

147
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,710
I haven't had time to prepare a proper engagement ceremony for her,

148
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,150

But deep down,

176
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,000
I don't want to look into the missing parts,

177
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,720
because the past isn't important to me anymore.

178
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,240
So she can't remember?

179
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,390
That's amnesia.

She's much more mature now.

She used to be really defensive.

186
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,390
Maybe it's because when she was young,

187
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,270
she didn't have her mom by her side,

188
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,390
but now she's met her match,

189
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,190
and has Mr. Su looking after her.

190
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,030
As long as Chen is okay then all is well,

191
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,310
Mom is happy for you.

192
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,400
In the past,

193
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,570
the term "mom" was her breaking point.

194
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:45,790
My sister used to do a lot of rebellious things,

195
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,210
but it's not her fault,

196
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,910
because after all,

197
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,040
she didn't have her mother's love.

198
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,310
I think what you guys are saying is really inappropriate.

199
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,110
In my opinion,

200
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,860
looking kind on the outside doesn't mean anything,

201
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,190
because one can be evil on the inside, which is even scarier.

202
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,690
Chen has a wound from losing her mom,

203
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,040
yet, as her sister,

204
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,990
you keep mentioning this.

205
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,550
Are you trying to hurt her on purpose?

206
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,510
What I mean is...

207
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,790
Also, Mrs. Ning,

208
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,210
as an elder, you are harsh on your juniors,

209
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,670
and you ignore the guests.

210
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,160
Is this the hospitality of the Ning family?

211
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,560
Right,

212
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:25,960
Su is right,

213
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,530
what's wrong with you two?

214
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,150
Apologize to Chen right now.

215
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,050
This...

216
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,780
No, it's...

217
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,910
Chen, Mom is too happy today

218
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,300
so I spoke without thinking,

219
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,070
I'm sorry.

220
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,650
I'm sorry sister.

221
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,500
It's okay,

222
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,190
we're family.

223
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,870
Don’t be angry.

224
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,440
Don’t mind what Su Yu said,

225
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,810
he just cares about me,

226
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,690
and doesn't want me to be wronged.

227
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,730
Today is a happy day for our family,

228
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,010
let's not be angry.

229
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,050
Chen,

230
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,490
you’ve grown up.

231
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,600
Sorry Mr. Ning,

232
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,010
it was rude of me.

233
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,510
I know you did it to protect Chen.

234
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,080
I also want you two to be happy forever,

235
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,910
and for our family's partnership to last forever.

236
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,400
Thank you, Mr. Ning.

237
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,630
Su,

238
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:14,630
you know,

239
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:19,410
from founding Ningmei, to getting where we are now, it hasn't been easy.

240
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,410
When I first started the company,

241
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,120
they were still young.

242
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,030
I've been fighting alone until now.

243
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:31,870
There must have been many enemies that you had to deal with back then.

244
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,410
So what?

245
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:37,140
In the end, they were all defeated by me.

246
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,020
By the way,

247
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,540
since you two are engaged,

248
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,270
when will you arrange for the parents to meet?

249
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,490
Both of my parents

250
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,900
have passed away.

251
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:18,980
I'm sorry,

252
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,460
I need to use the bathroom.

253
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,870
Why hasn't Su come back yet?

254
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,190
The dishes are getting cold.

255
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,520
I'll go check on him.

256
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,090
He might have gotten lost.

257
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,310
What's wrong with you two?

258
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,860
You almost ruined my plan.

259
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:25,630
Dad,

260
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,270
I’m just afraid that now that she has Su Yu,

261
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,830
my sister will disrespect me even more.

262
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,560
Listen to me,

263
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,570
this contract is very important,

264
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,520
both of you need to watch it.

265
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,020
Don't worry,

266
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,110
-we know.
-Enough.

267
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,710
If you're going to keep talking nonsense, don't stay home.

268
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,180
I don't need anything else that will spoil it for me.

269
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,920
Dad, don't be fooled by my sister...

270
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,560
Moxi.

271
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,880
We know we were wrong,

272
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,960
and I won't make such a mistake again,

273
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,280
but I want to remind you something.

274
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,110
What is it?

275
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,070
I thought the engagement between Chen and Su Yu

276
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,000
was too hasty, too fast.

277
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,990
I was afraid that Chen might not know him well,

278
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,790
so I asked someone to investigate Su Yu.

279
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,770
So, did you find anything?

280
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,720
I found that all the files of Su Yu

281
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,320
are from after university.

282
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,260
There was nothing from his life before university.

283
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,070
Don’t you find that strange?

284
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,320
What I need now is Su Yu’s brand's

285
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,310
influence on the younger generation.

286
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:24,430
Su Yu’s strengths and talents are solid,

287
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,350
it’s also what Ningmei needs,

288
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,750
so nothing else matters.

289
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,270
But...

290
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,110
Enough.

291
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,210
They still haven't come back,

292
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,110
go take a look.

293
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,550
Su Yu?

294
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,150
Chen?

295
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,110
Why did you come down?

296
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,880
Let's go upstairs, the dishes are getting cold.

297
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,270
Thank you for the food.

298
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,070
Su, you should come often.

299
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,350
Also, I wish us a successful partnership.

300
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:34,800
Let’s go.

301
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,720
Su Yu,

302
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,020
go get some fresh air with me.

303
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:55,670
Sure.

304
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,150
Su Yu,

305
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:10,470
why don’t you smile anymore?

306
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,890
You weren't like this before.

307
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,710
Before?

308
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,290
Yeah.

309
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,690
Anyways, I just haven't seen you smile.

310
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,950
Maybe it's because there's nothing funny happening.

311
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,430
Then I'll tell you a joke.

312
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,210
I don't want to hear it.

313
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,380
Did you know?

314
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,000
Dragons actually exist in this world.

315
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,510
What?

316
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,380
When I was seven,

317
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,710
one evening,

318
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,110
the sky suddenly became dull

319
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,540
and it was raining outside.

320
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,220
My mom suddenly told me to go home for dinner,

321
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,100
but I couldn't hear her.

322
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,410
So then my mom asked me,

323
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,190
"Are you deaf?"

324
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,530
See, you smiled.

325
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,710
I didn't.

326
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:03,670
Su Yu,

327
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:08,470
I can't believe we're actually becoming husband and wife.

328
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,660
Even though it's fake.

329
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,440
Yeah.

330
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,430
Su Yu,

331
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,630
I’ve actually always been curious,

332
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,650
why are you faking a marriage with me?

333
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,600
I told you,

334
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,190
this has nothing to do with you.

335
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:22,920
Tell me,

336
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,190
I can help you.

337
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,910
For example,

338
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,530
what were you doing in Ning Zhaoxiong's study earlier?

339
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,100
Even if you don't tell me, I already know.

340
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,490
Your target is Ning Zhaoxiong, right?

341
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,460
I can feel it from your eyes.

342
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,350
When you look at him,

343
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,330
there's hatred in your eyes.

344
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,120
I'm really familiar with that type of look.

345
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,560
I've been curious,

346
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,790
why you called him Ning Zhaoxiong,

347
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,630
and not Dad?

348
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,960
Do you think he treats me like his daughter?

349
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,310
This is why

350
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,040
I'm not worried about what you'll do to him.

351
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,690
I might even be able to help you.

352
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,270
Actually,

353
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,550
you're right.

354
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,470
I do hate Ning Zhaoxiong.

355
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,710
When I was young,

356
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,780
my family also owned a jewelry shop.

357
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,610
But we were set up by others,

358
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,080
and our reputation was ruined.

359
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,360
In the end,

360
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,430
we lost our shop

361
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,840
and ended up in debt.

362
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,780
My mom ran away with someone else.

363
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,430
My dad,

364
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,660
carrying the title of a black-hearted merchant,

365
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,260
started going down the drain

366
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,240
and died of depression.

367
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,620
Later on, I started living with my relatives.

368
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,130
I changed my name,

369
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,340
got into university,

370
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,760
studied jewelry design,

371
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,080
went abroad,

372
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:14,970
founded S&YU,

373
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,270
and became the Su Yu you know now.

374
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,070
So,

375
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:26,070
Ning Zhaoxiong was the one who attacked your family?

376
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,230
I only know it's related to Ningmei,

377
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,800
but the evidence must be in Ning Zhaoxiong's hands.

378
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,130
But since it’s been so long,

379
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,670
if all we did was business,

380
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,570
I won't be able to find out Ning Zhaoxiong's secret.

381
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,730
That is until I met you.

382
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,830
I saw your determination to control the Ning family

383
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,070
and your ambition.

384
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,140
Therefore,

385
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,280
we,

386
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,850
have the same goal.

387
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,440
Can you recite "Quiet Night Thought"?

388
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,680
Then recite it for me.

389
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,800
"Quiet Night Thought" Tang, Li Bai.

390
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,910
Before my bed, there is a pool of moonlight.
It seemed like frost on the ground.

391
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:08,570
Lifting my head, I could see the bright moon.
Lowering my head, I dream that I'm home.

392
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:10,650
Have a drink.

393
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:11,620
Thank you.

394
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:17,710
Su Yu,

395
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,130
for all this,

396
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,130
you must always live in a lie,

397
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,470
wearing a mask and fake a marriage with me.

398
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,640
Is it worth it?

399
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,390
I never thought about it.

400
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,310
What if you meet someone you like?

401
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,360
What if you meet someone you love?

402
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,950
I'll eventually forget it.

403
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,310
Then have you forgotten?

404
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,310
What about you, Ms. Ning?

405
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,000
Haven't you been living in lies as well?

406
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,630
Yeah,

407
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,710
I've been living in a lie.

408
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,290
I've been living for others for the past ten years.

409
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,520
I've never really thought about what I want,

410
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,080
what I like, and what I hate.

411
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,750
Even now,

412
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,750
I don't even know who I am.

413
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,600
Everything I do seems meaningless.

414
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,420
Here,

415
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,790
to our fake marriage.

416
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:38,770
We have news that

417
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,630
Ningmei Jewelry will officially announce

418
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,990
their partnership with S&YU Jewelry today.

419
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,700
It is said that Ning Mochen, the eldest daughter of Ningmei Jewelry,

420
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,910
and Su Yu, the founder of S&YU,

421
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,240
will also be officially getting married.

422
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:07,190
Song Yu,

423
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,670
find a place to sit.

424
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:13,550
Mr. Ning.

425
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:14,840
Su, you're here.

426
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,990
Let me introduce to you,

427
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,600
Mr. Li of Tianyu Group.

428
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:19,550
Su Yu.

429
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:20,970
-Hello.
-Hello.

430
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,030
Mochen,

431
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,270
wait here.

432
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,210
I’ll take you to see Mr. Zhao.

433
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,540
Ms. Ning.

434
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,110
Ye Yunkai.

435
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,030
Congratulations.

436
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,390
Why are you here?

437
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:53,740
Come with me.

438
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,610
There are so many people here,

439
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,940
and the reporters are still here,

440
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,540
so don't do anything stupid.

441
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,960
If you don't come with me,

442
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,320
don't blame me for what I'll do.

443
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,880
Let's go.

444
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,510
I knew things aren't that simple.

445
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,180
My men checked everything,

446
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,440
you and Su Yu worked together to set me up.

447
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,820
You’re right,

448
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,040
what's wrong with that?

449
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,550
Ye Yunkai,

450
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:22,490
you should also get a taste of betrayal.

451
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:23,890
Ning Mochen, you bitch!

452
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:24,630
Ye Yunkai!

453
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,830
There's a CCTV above your head.

454
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,490
I'm the main character today.

455
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,170
If I'm not there,

456
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,000
everyone will be looking for me.

457
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,760
If you lay a hand on me right now,

458
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,430
then you’re just a fool.

459
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:52,270
Mr. Ning,

460
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,460
excuse me.

461
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:58,880
Aren't you afraid I'll tell your dad about the shadow company?

462
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,510
I'm the one who helped Su Yu and Ningmei join hands.

463
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,010
Don't even talk about money.

464
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,120
Even if I had killed and set fire to people in the past,

465
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,460
Ning Zhaoxiong won't do anything to me.

466
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,580
Then when you get engaged,

467
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,910
I'll tell the world about our relationship.

468
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,590
Ye Yunkai,

469
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,900
are these dirty tricks all you have left?

470
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,840
If my reputation is ruined,

471
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,300
what can you get in return?

472
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,350
Unless,

473
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,590
you've made up your mind to die with me.

474
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,380
I'm sorry, Chen,

475
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,240
I let you down before.

476
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,750
But you have to believe me.

477
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,910
I really like you.

478
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,390
I really do love you.

479
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,850
I've always wanted to enter Ningmei,

480
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,510
because I wanted to be good enough for you.

481
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,030
Ye Yunkai,

482
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,770
Bai Li is the one you should be apologizing to,

483
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,880
and not me, Ning Mochen.

484
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,700
Chen, I know

485
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,650
I didn't listen to you before.

486
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,820
But you said

487
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,200
Bai Li is useful to Mr. Feng.

488
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,350
That's why I never did anything to her.

489
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,480
Don't worry,

490
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,350
I have Bai Li's custody now.

491
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,600
As long as I sign it,

492
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,750
Bai Li will lose her life anytime.

493
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,220
Don't be angry.

494
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,800
Let's make up.

495
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:59,230
Okay?

496
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,540
I'm warning you,

497
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,400
stay away from me

498
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,530
or I'll make you pay the price.

499
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,070
Mr. Su has some matters to take care of,

500
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,880
so he'll be attending a bit later.

501
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,710
Let me introduce you all

502
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,060

As the founder, Mr. Su Yu

510
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,590
never forgot his original intentions,

511
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,870
and returned to his homeland to pursue development.

512
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,110
