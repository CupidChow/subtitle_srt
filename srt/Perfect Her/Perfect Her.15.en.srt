Ning Mochen,

00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,630
you evil temptress!

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,140
What are these?

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,150
She wants to take this opportunity

8
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,600
to drag all of us into this.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,780
She's not your senior.

10
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,310
She's a lunatic. A psycho.

11
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,030
Enough!

12
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,090
Long time no see, Ms. Ning.

Ms. Bai.

14
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,390
Looks like the relationship between the hero and the heroine is going to reach its climax.

15
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:37,830
Yes.

16
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,270
This marks emotional intimacy between them.

17
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,060
The story is indeed old-fashioned.

18
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:43,950
I have something to ask you.

19
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:44,950
Boss, have a seat.

20
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:45,590
Come.

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,830

have been told numerous times by numerous people

27
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,310
since Shakespeare.

28
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,430
It's almost impossible to create plots

29
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,190
that are completely beyond people's expectations.

30
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,070
The set patterns you mentioned

31
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,990

35
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,550
are you making excuses for the new page

You're not here to discuss the plot with me.

39
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,230
Of course not.

40
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,550
I came to question you why you uploaded it without coloring it.

41
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,289
You really make me worried.

I've heard a lot about you.

Ms. Bai, you're here too.

00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,820
Ms. Bai is my new partner.

00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,110
She's also the one who facilitated this meeting.

53
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,660
Okay.

54
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,670
Ms. Bai,

55
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,730
sorry for what happened at my birthday party last time.

56
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,790
You know your daughter well.

57
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,370
I'm just an outsider. Who am I to mock you?

58
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,440

61
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,200
I didn't expect this to happen.

62

Let's not mention the past. Come. Have a seat.

Mr. Yang,

64
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,190

69
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,810
You're being too polite.

70
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,310
Mr. Ning,

71
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,310
I think the view in your office is nice.

72
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,579
You can even play golf here.

73
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,240
Ms. Bai,

74
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,930
you like playing golf too?

75
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,870
I don't know how to play golf.

76
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,880
I'll take you to a golf course if there is a chance.

77
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:31,810
Okay.

78
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:36,270
It would be great

79
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,890
if I have an office like yours one day.

80
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,530
Mr. Ning,

81
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,160
what do you mean?

82
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,280
You're Chen's therapist.

83
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,420
I need her medical information.

84
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,460
I've found another way

85
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,360
to get a medical certificate

86
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,990
that can prove Ning Mochen has mental illness.

87
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,840
Mr. Ning,

88
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,600

is your daughter.

90
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,480
This medical certificate will ruin her.

91
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,740
You just need to give me the information.

00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,820
The amount of money in this card

93
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,870
will make you satisfied.

94
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,240
Mr. Ning,

95
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,290
you want to use this medical certificate

96
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,760
to send her to a mental hospital?

97
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,370
As her father, I have the right to know about her condition.

98
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,490
Don't ask anything else.

99
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,000
Mr. Ning,

100
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,230
it's a thorough plan.

101
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,600
Ning Zhaoxiong deserves his reputation.

102
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,490
His own daughter

103
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,270
is also like a worthless abandoned pawn.

104
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,110

105
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,230
are you okay?

106
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,670
I'm fine.

00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,580

00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,930
she will go crazy

113
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,150

00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,440
I'm always here.

00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,510

I've fixed it.

00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,310
Thank you so much.

125
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,750
I was scared when the light went out.

126
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,950
Just call me if anything happens.

Why don't you have a drink with me?

131
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,230
It's too late. I should go back.

132
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,400
Are you trying to avert suspicion?

133
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,070
Bai Li, that's not what I mean.

134
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,530
Then stay here for a while.

135
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,710
Actually...

136
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,430
I was quite scared when the light went out just now.

137
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,840
I've been living here alone

138
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,190

00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,669
No.

144
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,570
Then why do you look restless?

145
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,350
What?

146
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,280
Are you very nervous

147
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,820
because you are with me alone?

148
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,420
I just think it's too late.

149
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,820
I'm worried it's not convenient to stay at your place.

150
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,520
Sorry. I need to answer this call.

151

154
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,760
who is it?

155
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,360
Hello?

156
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,170
Sorry. The subscriber you dialed can't be connected for the moment.

158

Yes.

159
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,500
Are you worried about her?

160
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,900
She must be upset due to the scandal.

161
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:58,750
But

162
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,660
she deserves it.

163
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,690
Compared to her,

164
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,720
I'm more worried

165

Yes.

168
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,770
You were deceived by her.

169
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:15,440
Am I wrong?

170
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,520
Can you really accept

171
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,450

172

Bai Li,

173
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,730
Ning Mochen really has changed a lot.

174
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,020
Also, I think

175
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,480
this matter is really strange.

176
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,100

-Alright.

177
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,680

179
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:50,950

180
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,830
Actually...

181
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,290
I was very scared just now.

182
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,820
When the light went out,

183
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,060
I recalled what happened between Ye Yunkai and me.

184

Can you

185
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,360
not go back tonight?

186
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,190
Stay here with me.

187
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,110
Okay?

190
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,680
Rest early.

191
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,310
The past her and the current her are both her.

192
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,460

377
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,480
I'd like to give an official response to this matter.

378
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,790
We have indeed withheld some information.

379
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,460
My daughter Ning Mochen

380
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,730
has a congenital mental disorder.

381
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,880
She's been on medication and receiving medical help over these years.

382
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,060
However, being unable to control her emotions,

383
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,630
she caused severe

384
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,920
emotional harm to the victim when they were dating.

385
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,530
We're deeply sorry about that.

386
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,330
We'll be fully cooperative

00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,480
when it is time to make compensation.

00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:54,150
Meanwhile, I implore the victim's family and the media

389
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,180

A dramatic twist!

398
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:19,840
Ning Mochen, the daughter of Ningmei Jewelry's chairman, actually has a mental illness.

399
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,790
The chairman of Ningmei Jewelry, Ning Zhaoxiong,

400
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,270
issued a public apology on his daughter's behalf

401
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,670
and promised to make compensation.

402
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:28,210
An official response from Ningmei Jewelry says that Ning Mochen has been expelled from the group.

403
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,250
A bad ending!

404

416
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,560
in the financial reports of your company.

Your company focuses on running food brands.

420

But I guess it has suffered a huge loss.

421
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:16,070
That said, the financial reports seem perfectly fine.

But most of them have been shut down.

00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,670
Don't worry.

560
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,360
I'm here for you.

561
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,860
I won't let anyone take you away.

562
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,620
Why would you help me?

563
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,300
Now, everyone thinks of me

564
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,449
as a terrible person.

565
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,469
I don't care what kind of person you are.

566
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:22,670
The way that Ning Zhaoxiong is handling this

567
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,929
is unacceptable to me.

568
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:31,510
So you're just being a righteous person?

569
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:32,739
What?

570
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,580
Nothing.

571
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:46,800
Mr. Su, are you going to accuse me

572
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,449
of colluding with Mr. Ning

573
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,130
to jeopardize Ms. Ning?

574
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,260
Isn't it true?

575
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,250
Mr. Su,

576
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,670
I guess

577
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,680
you've noticed

578
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,520
that she's different from before, right?

579
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,890
Based on the information I've gathered,

580
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:11,210
she has already displayed signs of delusional disorder.
