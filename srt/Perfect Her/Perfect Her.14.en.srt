You deliberately provoked me

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,230
so you could put on a show for him, right?

Why did your brother commit suicide?

44
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,350
Because of a woman.

45
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,220
A bad woman.

Then she ditched him.

when I was asleep,

63
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,900
I had a dream where my brother told me a name.

64
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:21,910
What name?

65
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,340

who got my brother into that desperate situation step by step!

75

Do you have any proof?

76
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,450
Of course I do.

77
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,460
What kind of proof?

78
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,580
Can you introduce me to this girl?

79

she ruined my marriage,

102
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,570
stole my husband,

103
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,920
and cost me all my property.

104
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,830
Not long ago...

105
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,200
Not long ago, I even got into an accident

106
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,480
that nearly killed me.

107
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,260
Are you okay?

I'm fine.

that I had lost everything when I woke up.

111

112
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,250
being brought to justice,

113
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,480
the culprit even rose to become...

Ms. Bai, you asked us for a meeting

137
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,500
to inquire about your husband Ye Yunkai, right?

138
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,250
We know nothing about him.

139
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,880
He's a nasty little punk.

140
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,790
The Ning family wouldn't have anything to do with him.

141
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,720
That's not what this meeting is for.

142
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,940
I'm just here

143
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,630
to send my early congratulations on your 60th birthday.

144
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,190

145
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,280
How did you get to know that?

146
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,770

00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,750
Previously, I read some news online.

151

Some time ago,

152

153

things went chaotic.

154
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,430
The Ning family was somewhat affected.

155
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,670
So,

156
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:11,010
I'd like to clear things up at your birthday party.

157
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,360
Ningmei Jewelry

158
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,340
didn't suffer much damage

159
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,230
due to the plagiarism incident.

160
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,350
You're offering to clear things up

161
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,400
because you want to help Su Yu, right?

162
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,730
Don’t you forget

163
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,260
that your other daughter Ning Mochen

164
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,910
is engaged to him.

165
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,860
It's true that what happened was unpleasant,

166
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,240
but their engagement

167
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,610
has been known to the entire industry.

168
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,200
So,

169
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,670
if Su Yu manages to rise from the ashes,

170
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,080
it'll only bring benefits

171
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,570

Do you think I'm in need of media attention?

183
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,080
Ms. Bai,

184
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,740
I wonder why you're doing this.

185
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,740

00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,980
you admitted to plagiarism because of me.

192
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,050
Bai Li,

193
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,080
I did it by choice.

194
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,520
Plus, we were up against Ye Yunkai at that time.

195
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,290
I had to make a temporary expedient.

196
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,630
Don't blame this on yourself.

197
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,380
You are an excellent designer.

198
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,980
Your reputation must not be tarnished.

199
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,790
This is my way to compensate you.

200
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,120
I hope you'll attend the party.

201
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,460
That is when

202
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,470
I will clear your name and tell people

203
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,800
the truth about the plagiarism incident.

204
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,550
Besides,

205
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,450
Ms. Ning, I hope you can be a witness to it.

206
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,550
Since you are Su Yu’s fiancee,

207
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,990
you should stand up, stay by his side

208
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,230
and support him at this particular moment.

209
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,910
Bai Li...

210
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,000
Don't worry.

211
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,270
My head is all fine now.

212
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,980
I've been thinking

213
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,290
about this matter for a long time.

214
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,350
It is high time

215
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,310
I put an end to it.

216
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,980
What do you want now?

217
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,780
Ms. Ning,

218
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,200
despite all your hatred for me,

219
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,810
I believe we both

220
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,480
want someone to attest to Su Yu's innocence,

221
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,780
right?

222
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,180
I hope you will attend the party, Ms. Ning.

223
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,830
Today, the chairman of Ningmei Jewelry Ning Zhaoxiong

224
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,200
is holding a party for his 60th birthday.

225
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,630
He has invited many people in the industry to this celebration.

226
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,990
A source told us

227
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,220
that there would be an important announcement at the party.

228
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:42,770
[Birthday]

229
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,620
Previously, there were some misunderstandings.

230
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,100
Su Yu's company and ours

231
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,560
[Fox TV Station]

232
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,070
were unfortunately jeopardized.

233
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,230
Later on, we'll make a public statement to the media

234
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,560
and clarify the incident in a fair manner.

235
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,190
We'll also deepen our cooperation in the future.

236
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,070
Mr. Ning, are you suggesting

237
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,670
that Mr. Su and Ms. Ning will still get married?

238
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,750
Of course.

239
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,880
Su Yu is still my future son-in-law.

240
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,150
When is the wedding?

241
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,190
Will there be new products launched in the wedding?

242
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,990
Will Mr. Su and Ms. Ning

243
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,390
engage in the management of Ningmei Jewelry?

244
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,850
No need to rush, everyone.

245
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,270
We'll get to the point soon.

246
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,440
The person that's most closely

247
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,110
involved in this incident,

248
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,180
namely Ms. Bai Li,

249
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,010
[Fox TV Station]

250
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,330
will clear things up.

251
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:25,990
Bai Li!

252
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:29,990
This is great.

253
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
You've both come.

254
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,510
I've arranged for some reporters

255
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,970
to hear my statement after the party begins.

256
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,040
Thank you, Bai Li.

257
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:45,520
Ms. Ning,

258
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,620
I'm glad to see you here in support of Su Yu

259
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,310
despite our old grudges.

260
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,260
Let's go.

261
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:14,660
There you are.

262
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,140
Mr. Ning.

263
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,070
Didn't you declare to leave the Ning family, Mochen?

264
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:21,910
What now?

265
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,620
Are you planning to use the influence of our family

266
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,780
to better endorse your fiance?

267
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,480
I'm just glad that you came here.

268
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,140
Let's not talk about the past.

269
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,070
You're here at my birthday party now.

270
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,710
We'll still be a family in the future.

271
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:44,680
[Birthday]

272
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,750
Dear guests, thank you

273
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,710
for coming to my birthday party.

274
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,520
Ningmei Jewelry's success

275
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,510
is attributed to the companionship of you and my family.

276
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,240
Before the party begins,

277
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,600
I'd like to make a small request.

278
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,530
Ladies and gentlemen,

279
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:02,980
would you come up here and take a picture with me?

280
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,590
[Birthday]

281
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,910
-Sure!
-Thank you.

282
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,450
Congratulations, Mr. Ning.

283
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,350
Ning Mochen!

284
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,050
You evil temptress!

285
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,130
You went to great lengths to steal my brother's heart.

286
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,550
He even foolishly thought

287
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,620
he was the only man she loved.

288
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,950
But what did she do?

289
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,580
She hooked up with different men!

290
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,990
My brother tried to talk to you a million times,

291
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,490
but you wouldn't give him an explanation.

292
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,920
Even when he was about to kill himself,

293
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,100
you refused to meet him!

294
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,859
You let him die in misery and despair!

295
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,780
Ning Mochen,

296
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,200
do you remember my brother?

297
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,430
Do you even remember who he was?

298
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,750
You devil woman!

299
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:13,710
No.

300
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,060
You're not a human.

301
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,069
You don't even have a heart!

302
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,829

[Breaking news: Shocking scandals are revealed about Ning Mochen, daughter of Ningmei Jewelry's chairman]

Ning Mochen is intimate with multiple men.

305
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,790

313

See for yourself.

314
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,980
What are these?

315
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,180
I know you like to have fun, Mochen.

316
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,580
But this is too...

317
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,620

Do you want all of us to go down with you?

319
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,870
Lashing out at me can't solve these problems.

320
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,050
Solve these problems?

321
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:01,950
If you're out of the picture,

322
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,110

Tell me.

00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,950
How are you going to deal with it?

327
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,080
I think you should give the public an explanation.

328
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,820
Your silence is a confession.

329
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,730
If you're innocent,

330
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,290
then clarify the matter as soon as possible.

331
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:27,330
If you're guilty,

332
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,650
I hope you'll show the public a proper attitude.

333
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,690
You need to apologize to the victim, make compensation

334
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,090
and beg for forgiveness.

335
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,450

we'll first find out who tipped off the media.

00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,610
This person is clearly

342
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,890
targeting Ningmei Jewelry and Chen.

343
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,810

Ning Mochen, what are you talking about?

347
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,350
Only she would do that.

348

How could it be possible?

349
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,110
Did she abet you into harming others,

350
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,550
or did she dig up dirt on you

351
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,910
so she could expose you today?

352
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,810
Even you aren't clear about these things.

353
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:20,980
Could she know better than you do?

354
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,910
Don't you forget

355
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,040
that she has lost some memories.

356
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,220
She hasn't lost any memories.

357
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,600
She's been lying to you.

358
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,790
The same old stories again.

359
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,050
I really don't want to hear them anymore.

360

Su Yu,

361
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,190
I didn’t hurt anyone.

362
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,010
Trust me one more time.

363
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,100
As long as

364
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,370
I get a chance to talk to Bai Li,

365
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,020
I can figure out the truth.

366
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,800
Who is it?

367
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,100
Dr. Peng, I didn't know you were Bai Li's therapist too.

368
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,570
Thank you for helping her.

369

Since Dr. Peng is with us today,

I'd like to ask about Ms. Bai's psychological state.

373
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,630
Ms. Bai,

374
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:21,260
how much do you know about the terrible things I've done?

375
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:23,870
Oh.

376
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,100
You mean the photos at the party, right?

377
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,060
The whole thing is also news to me.

378
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,110
Ning Mochen,

379
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,490
this matter has nothing to do with Bai Li.

380
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,320
Really?

381
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,060
Then why did she invite us to the party?

382
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,020
You thought we should be there

383
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,220
for the best dramatic effect, right?

384
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,460
I invited you to the birthday party

385
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,470
really because

386
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,540
I wanted to clear Su Yu's name.

387
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,710
I didn't expect

388
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,400
such an unpleasant incident to happen.

389
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,360
I'm sorry.

390
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,710
Actually,

391
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,750
Ms. Bai is also feeling guilty.

392
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,930
That's why I've advised her

393
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,080
to ask you out for a talk.

394
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,890
Ning Mochen,

395
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,280
stop being unreasonable.

396
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,030
Who is being unreasonable now?

397
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:19,330
I thought you were a poor woman.

398
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,390
I just ignored a fact

399
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,290
that pitiful people are sometimes detestable people.

400
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,090
Being reduced to this situation

401
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,080
is the result of your own actions.

402
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,550
You are the one who did wrong.

403
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,510
Why are you pinning the blame

404
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,160
on someone who is irrelevant to the matter?

405
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,030
Ning Mochen, this is enough.

406
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,960
Su Yu, do you still not understand?

407
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,200
She's not only targeting me, but also you.

408
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,490
She's taking this opportunity to destroy us.

409
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,910
She's not the Bai Li you met in college.

410
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,360
She is a crazy woman now!

411
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,100
Enough!

412
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,600
Dr. Peng,

413
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,680
please take Bai Li home.

414
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,260
Ms. Bai, let me take you home.

415
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,950
Ning Mochen, what's the matter with you?

416
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,840
If you have something to say, say it to me.

417
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,660
I don't have anything to say to you.

418
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,390
I have no idea what the truth is.

419
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,870
Look, that's Ning Mochen.

420
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,110
Let's take photos of her!

421
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,840
What's worth taking photos of?

422
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,450
Thank you for helping me out.

423
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,310
I did it because I hate that kind of thing.

424
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,460
For the time being,

425
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,700
I know you won't believe anything I say.

426
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,910
But I promise I'll find proof.

427
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,830
I wonder what she attempts to achieve

428
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,460
by cooking up these schemes.

429
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,970
Anyway,

430
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,570
you should be wary of her.

431
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,340
Don't put too much trust in her.

432
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:18,900
Ning Mochen,

433
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,600
you've done nothing but vent your anger on Bai Li and suspect her.

434
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,660
Do you really think you're innocent?

435
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,250
Since the incident happened,

436
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,750
I haven't seen any guilt or remorse on your face.

437
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,180
I didn't do that thing. Why should I feel guilty?

438
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,510
But the evidence clearly says otherwise!

439
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,720
If you really didn't do it,

440
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,790
then give me an explanation.

441
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,730
As long as you explain it,

442
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:36,830
I'll believe you for once

443
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:40,030
and find all the evidence needed to prove your innocence.

444
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,650
I have nothing to say.

445
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,190
You have nothing to say.

446
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,120
That's because the accusations are true.

447
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,620
You want everyone to forget what you've done

448
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,490
and pretend that nothing happened.

449
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,150
You think you've cleaned up your act now, right?

450
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:54,780
Su Yu,

451
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,320
I really can't explain it to you now.

452
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,430
I don't know why you don't

453
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,070
feel any guilt or shame.

454
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,350
I just can't understand.

455
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,090
Do you

456
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,590
hate me now?

457
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,010
How is the situation outside?

458
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,830
Although the PR department has tried to get the public opinion under control,

459
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,960
the stock price still keeps dropping.

460
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,390
Many of our business partners are requesting to cancel orders.

461
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,000
The shareholders are asking to see you, saying...

462
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,970
saying that they demand an explanation.

463
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:31,770
Explanation?

464
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,340
What is there to explain?

465
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:36,240
These people are kicking me when I'm down.

466
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,300
None of them are reliable when big things happen.

467
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,110
Dad.

468
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:45,960
What are you doing here?

469
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,390
I don't have time for you now.

470
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,110
Dad,

471
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,930
I'm worried about your health.

472
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,430
We're facing a crisis now.

473
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:54,030
I should try to share your burdens, right?

474
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,910
What can you help with?

475
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,430
I'll be grateful if you don't create another mess.

476
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,270
I know

477
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,370
I'm not competent enough to earn your recognition now.

478
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,790
But given the huge trouble Mochen has caused...

479
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,680
Don't even talk about her.

480
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,150
Dad,

481
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,390
now is not the time to get mad.

482
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,690
We should

483
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,880
have someone dealt with this problem.

484
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,870
Listen,

485
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,450
you'll soothe

486
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,540
the nerves of our business partners,

487
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,600
while I'll talk to the shareholders.

488
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,120
How would you like to proceed with it?

489
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,420
What else can I do?

490
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,670
Ning Mochen brought us this disaster.

491
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,830
Of course she has to be responsible for it.

492
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,970
What else can we do?

493
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:32,750
Dad,

494
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,030
I'm going to meet an important client today.

495
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,270
If everything goes well,

496
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,470
I'm sure our company will benefit a lot.

497
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,720
Then why don't you go now?

498
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,270
Mr. Yang,

499
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,670
hello.

500
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,110
Have a seat.

501
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,760
I came here with a friend.

502
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,030
You should meet her.

503
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,620
Long time no see, Ms. Ning.

504
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,280
Ms. Bai?

505
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:14,010
[Three days ago]

506
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,120
Isn't that Yang Guang?

507
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,380
What is he doing here?

508
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,820
I'm so lucky.

509
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,210
It looks like I'll have one more aide.

510
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,460
Shouldn't you be working in the Paris branch?

511
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,430
I came back in the beginning of this year.

512
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,440
Do I know you?

513
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,110
Sorry.

514
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:47,480
I mistook you for someone else.

515
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,100
I would never forget about

516
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,570
pretty ladies like you.

517
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:18,650
I can tell from the way you looked at me that you know me.

518
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,620
You're aware of my trip to Paris.

519
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,060
Tell me.

520
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,130
How did you know where I went?

521
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,690
I wouldn't just tell anyone about my work.

522
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:30,470
Waiter,

523
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,590
half a spoon of coffee beans.

524
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,360
The dark roast type, thanks.

525
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,830
Your choice of coffee resembles a friend of mine's.

526
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:43,460
You're keeping such a small detail in mind.

527
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,810
That must be a very special friend, right?

528
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:47,550
Of course.

529
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,030
Your girlfriend?

530
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:54,970
My ex-girlfriend.

531
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,320
I feel sorry for her.

532
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,510
She missed out on a man like you.

533
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,160
That is

534
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,080
a long story.

535
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,610
I'm all ears.

536
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,750
I really liked her.

537
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,420
But one day, she disappeared.

538
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,740
She wouldn't reply to my calls or texts.

539
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,940
I searched every place we had been to.

540
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,810
Then I went to Paris alone.

541
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,060
When I was...

542
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,190
Why are you giving me this look?

543
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,690
I want to have a clear look at you for her.

544
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,730
I can't believe we've been through the same suffering.

545
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,690
Someone took everything from me.

546
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,860
Then get it back.

547
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:57,820
Get it back?

548
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,210
I've lost everything now.

549
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:04,980
Except for accepting the reality,

550
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,790
there's nothing I can do.

551
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:09,710
I can help you.

552
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,190
What?

553
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,790
You don't believe me?

554
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,230
Do you know what I will do

555
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,680
after I get everything back?

556
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,210
Tell me about it.

557
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,760
I'll destroy

558
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:34,990
each and every thing.

559
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,130
That's all the more reason

560
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,520
for me helping you.

561
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,580
[Only love and alcohol can bridge the distance between you and me in this city]

562
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,120
You were sleeping like a log,

563
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,380
so I didn't wake you up.

564
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,990
What do you want for breakfast?

565
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,720
My driver is right downstairs.

566
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,730
I'm sure what I want

567
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:10,730
is what you want too.

568
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:11,910
Go ahead.

569
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,050
Ningmei Jewelry.

570
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,660
From now on,

571
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:26,270
I'll be in charge of Mr. Yang's cooperation with your company.

572
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,790
In addition,

573
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,930
I'd like to meet Mr. Ning in person.
