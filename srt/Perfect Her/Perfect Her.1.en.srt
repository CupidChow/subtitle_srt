the daughter of Ning Zhaoxiong and his first wife,

86
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,270
Ning Mochen.

87
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,830
But she's a social butterfly in the jewelry circle.

88
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,030
She's had dating rumors with many rich men,

89
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,919
so her relationship with the Ning family is very tense.

90
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,150
However, rumor has it that she’s going to get engaged

91
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,160
with international designer Su Yu, the man beside her.

92
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,950

When Ye Yunkai just started working in the jewelry industry,

Bai Li's father was already a designer of a famous brand.

100
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,360
I wonder how Ye Yunkai managed to woo Bai Li.

101
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,890
Bai Li was willing to cut ties with her parents to be with him.

102
