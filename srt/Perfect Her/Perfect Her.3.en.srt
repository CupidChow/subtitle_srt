You human scum!

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:08,750
How could you do this to me?

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,170
How could you do this to me?

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,060
Is Su Yu the reason that you're treating me like this?

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,030
Every sentence you say disgusts me.

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,290
Are you pretending to have lost your memories?

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,870
Is my relationship with Ye Yunkai the reason that...

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,080
Ning Mochen, I'm gonna say this again.

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,860
We simply faked our engagement.

11
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,150
I don't care if you're involved with another man.

12
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,830
Why would Su Yu get together with you?

13
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,030
All he wants is profit too.

14
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,900
He might ditch you at any time.

15
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,470
Taking my side

16
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,110
is the best choice for you.

17
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,150
It seems wrong.

18
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,790
How so? What's wrong?

19
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,230
Dramatic plots and conflicts, the female lead rising from the ashes, enemies being humiliated.

20

All the elements are included.

21
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,830
Don't you think the story line

22
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,230

23

The early conflicts lie in

26
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,440
the cheater, his wife, and the homewrecker.

27
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,110
There is no room for the male lead no matter how great he is.

28
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:58,830
Ms. Ai,

29
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,550
you need to be clear about who our target audience is.

30
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:07,070
The female lead should be the male lead's unreachable first love?

31
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,510
Now you're making progress.

32
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,350
I burned the midnight oil in the last two days to finish this script...

33
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,350
Staying up late is bad for your health.

34
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,510
You should just work through the night.

35
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,270
I'm looking forward to reading a new script.

40
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,510
why am I feeling

41
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,670
that the accident has turned you into a different person?

42
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,520
No one is more intimate with me than you are.

43
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,410
Even you can't tell

44
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,710

45
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,190
Of course I can.

46
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,640
Chen,

47
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,960

48
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,380
or change yourself in any way,

49
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,390
and I can still see through you right away.

50
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,110
Because

51
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,910

00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,040

55
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,310
Is there nothing real

56

What are you talking about?

58
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:18,029

Haven't you already gotten used to such relationships

Why are you still looking so confused?

110

111

Have we been here before?

I think we should use our money wisely.

Although I can't marry you now,

152
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,350
I did design this ring

If I terminate the guardianship of her,

Nonetheless, it is actually a good thing

But I want to be able to recall every past incident.

275
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,590
You were traumatized in childhood.

276
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,110
You parents divorced when you were little.

277
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,840
Your father got remarried soon,

278
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,590
and had a new daughter.

279
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,110
Your stepmother often abused you.

280
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,160
But she pretended

281
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,710
to treat you and your younger sister the same.

282
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,910
You told your father about this.

283
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:29,150
But being deceived by your stepmother,

284
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,040
your father chose not to believe you.

285
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,150
Since then,

286
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,020
you became extremely disappointed in men,

287
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,030
but also desperate for them.

288
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,510
Does it mean I distrust men,

289
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,030
but I also crave for the company of them?

290
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,870

00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,310
has the kind of amazing skill needed for that.

371
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,150
I'd rather not rashly carve it myself.

372
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,530
You could've asked me for help.

373
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,070
Mr. Feng and I

374
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,590
have done some design projects together.

375
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,550
I'm on good terms with him.

376
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,070
Why don't I bring the bracelet to him

377
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,550
so he can do the carving? I'll return it to you when it's done.

378
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:48,680
The carving on this bracelet was done by Mr. Feng.

379
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,040
You can recognize Mr. Feng's handiwork?

380
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,030
I've just learned a thing or two about him.

381
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,670
I've heard that Ye Yunkai plans to use Mr. Feng

382
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,550
to improve the quality of Chenyun Jewelry's products,

383
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,350
and to finally become Ningmei Jewelry's business partner.

384
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,230
Mr. Feng retired many years ago.

385
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,430
He even turned us down when we invited him to work with us.

386
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,150
He can't be easily persuaded by Ye Yunkai.

387
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:13,680
But Mr. Feng and Bai Li are old friends.

388
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,630
Because of Bai Li,

389
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,070
he has offered help to Ye Yunkai.

390
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,350
He is free to make his own decisions.

391
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,750
I hope you can stop them from working together.

392
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,910
Why?

393
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,190
Because Ye Yunkai is not trustworthy.

394
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,280
This is the funniest joke I've heard.

395
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,960
Do you even care about that?

396
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,130
As your ally,

397
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,790
all I can do is help you earn a place in the Ning family.

398
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,840
I don't want anything to do with your personal life or other stuff.

399
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:48,710
Are you going to sit back and watch Ye Yunkai rise to fame?

400
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,840
You're tired of him,

401
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,100
so you want to use me to ditch him, right?

402
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,180
Ning Mochen, how can you be so heartless?

403
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,420
Ye Yunkai is indeed a punk.

404
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,350
But since the success of his company is largely attributed to Bai Li,

405
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,870
I won't interfere with his business.

406
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,630
Su Yu...

407
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,590
I'll say this again.

408
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,590
I don't want to interfere with his business.

409
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,580
Shouldn't you be leaving now?

410
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,480
Ms. Ning,

411
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,680
where is my boss?

412
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,710
Bai Li,

413
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,250
if

414
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,990
I had been braver years ago,

415
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,030
would there have been a different ending?

416
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:49,000
♫If parting is an illness♫

417
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:56,920
♫Then you're the irreplaceable cure♫

418
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:55,350
Bai Li.

419
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,110
What's up?

420
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:04,420
♫You're the only one I care about in this crowded city♫

421
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,910
As you know,

422
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,230
I have graduated.

423
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,590
I'm leaving the design school next week.

424
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:12,260
♫I'm determined to have my heartbeat get closer to yours♫

425
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,800
So,

426
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,190
I have to tell you something now.

427
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:18,070
♫You say love is like♫

428
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,190
♫A rainstorm that wind can't blow away♫

429
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,110
Go ahead.

430
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:28,010
♫No matter how it hysterically♫

431
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,550
What I want to say is...

432
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:33,390
♫Calls out someone's name♫

433
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:39,840
♫I'm following you♫

434
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:37,990
What I want to say is,

435
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,510
thank you for always taking care of me.

436
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,830
It's very nice of you to say that.

437
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:47,560
♫All the things you do♫

438
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,720
I believe your talent

439
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,350
will take you far after graduation.

440
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,790
I'm very flattered.

441
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,300
♫I'm running fast since I don't want to be late♫

442
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:52,880
I really mean it.

443
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:57,500
♫Following the sparkling stars♫

444
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:02,900
♫I'm feeling my every breath♫

445
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,390
Thank you for those kind words.

446
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,030
Su Yu,

447
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:06,840
♫You're everywhere♫

448
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,790
I'm engaged.

449
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,630
Good.

450
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,220
What took you so long?

451
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,470
What has happened

452
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,310
can't be changed.

453
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:06,870
But in the future,

454
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,510
I won't let anyone hurt you again.

455
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,960
Welcome home.

456
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,660
You seem to be doing great today.

457
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:30,830
Su Yu,

458
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,360
there's something I want to tell you.

459
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,270
I think Bai Li is very lucky.

460
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,180
She has Cha,

461
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,180
and you.

462
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,110
I believe

463
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,510
she will wake up one day.

464
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,080
What are you trying to say?

465
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:59,510
Sometimes, in order to reach a certain goal,

466
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,280
people have to do something

467
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,510
that they hate.

468
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,430
They might even

469
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,470
become the kind of people they despise.

470
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:16,670
But it doesn't mean all that stuff is wrong.

471
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:20,670
Don't you think?

472
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,350
The only thing I know

473
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,150
is that people shouldn't act against their conscience,

474
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,550
at least for the sake of a good night's sleep.

475
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:29,790
Goodnight.

476
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,670
It's time to have a talk with Ye Yunkai.

477
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,770
[Shangri-La Hotel]

478
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:02,670
Chen,

479
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,590
why did you ask me to come here?

480
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:07,630
Have you had a change of mind?

481
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,830
Whether I've changed my mind or not doesn't concern you.

482
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,390
Ye Yunkai,

483
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,200
keep this in mind.

484
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,740
Now, it's you who needs my help,

485
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,590
not the other way around.

486
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,920
Are you sure?

487
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,990
I will get Mr. Feng on my team soon.

488
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,010
It's only a matter of time before Ningmei Jewelry becomes my business partner.

489
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,990
I

490
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,170
am the one who can help you win the power struggle in the Ning family.

491
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,640
I remember you saying

492
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,990
that Bai Li and Mr. Feng are good friends.

493
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,870
This time, he agreed to help you

494
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,750
only because of Bai Li.

495
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
So?

496
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,950
So without my permission,

497
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,290
you must keep Bai Li safe.

498
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,790
Bai Li is the key

499
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,650
to approaching Mr. Feng.

500
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,310
Have I made myself clear?

501
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:56,910
Yes.
