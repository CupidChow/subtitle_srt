[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,080
Bai Li's design drafts?

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,510
Su Yu will contact you.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,470
What do you want

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:13,910
to call our collaboration collection this time?

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,110
Gather and Disperse.

7
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,480
This is outright plagiarism, which is completely unethical.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,610
Are you crazy?

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,700
Are you going to

10
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,820
ruin your reputation for her?

11
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,190
I just want to be successful. What's wrong with that?

12
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,520
What's wrong with that?

13
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,850
Ye Yunkai has gone mad.

14
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,820
Therefore, they've long planned to take that scumbag down in this episode,

15
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,750
which is the first step of the female lead's revenge.

16
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,510
This episode has indeed managed to balance revenge and emotions.

17
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,970
Especially the last part.

18
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,330
It gives me the feeling that everything is over,

19
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,830
but it's also a new start.

20
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:52,310
Yeah.

21
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,270
But didn't you say the male lead has a bigger plan?

22
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,550
I thought it was for revenge

23
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,950
that he worked with that scumbag.

24
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,750
That's your guess.

25
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,750
I never said that.

26
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,349
If he prioritizes avenging Bai Li over avenging his father,

27
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:06,790
does that mean our male lead is a love-struck fool?

28
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,390
He just chose to achieve the easier goal first.

29
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,870
Doesn't that make perfect sense?

30
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,880
Then, will he fall in love with his enemy's daughter

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,950
after that small goal is achieved?

32
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:15,550
Yes.

33
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,789
Isn't that the kind of drama you want?

34
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:19,110
Did I say that?

35
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,590
Yes, Boss.

36
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,270
Then,

37
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,990
is the male lead a love-struck fool or not?

38
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:27,830
If he was,

39
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,550
would he give up his revenge

40
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,510
for the second female lead?

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,430
The male lead has never fallen in love with the second female lead.

42
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,110
He's always in love with the female lead.

43
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,360
So you mean the female lead is a love-struck fool?

44
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,590
She fell head over heels for that scumbag

45
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,850
and then the male lead.

46
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,670
Actually, I think people are overly sensitive

47
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,920
to the term "love-struck" nowadays.

48
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,550
If being love-struck means becoming a better version of oneself for each other

49
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,830
and helping each other fulfill their dreams,

50
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,340
I believe that's a positive form of love.

51
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,229
It's not foolish at all.

52
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,630
Love makes them better.

53
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,990
I agree with you.

54
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,710
But what you need to do now

55
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,070
is make the readers agree with you too.

56
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,840
Alright.

57
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,160
Get back to work.

58
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,610
[Perfect Her]

[Episode 11]

60
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,430
What's wrong?

61
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,670
Nothing.

62
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,670
Maybe it's just that I can finally breathe a sigh of relief.

63
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,790
Don't worry about me.

64
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,150
Back when I was in college,

65
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,270
I really enjoyed zoning out.

66
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,160
I'd spend the whole night doing nothing

67
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,150
but stargazing.

68
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:36,800
What's wrong?

69
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,470
Nothing.

70
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,950
Actually, someone said the same thing before.

71
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,630
She said

72
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,070
the starry sky could take away all her bad feelings

73
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,730
and heal her heart.

74
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,270
So from then on,

75
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,320
I've loved stargazing too.

76
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,340
Are you talking about Bai Li?

77
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,240
Yeah.

78
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:09,830
Su Yu.

79
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,490
Is it worth it?

80
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,500
What?

81
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,870
You ruined the reputation you've built up

82
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,330
over the years

83
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,110
just to drag Ye Yunkai down with you.

84
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,470
It's such a great cost.

85
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,670
Is it worth it?

86
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,350
For Bai Li,

87
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,270
I'd do anything.

88
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,030
Actually, I didn't agree with your plan

89
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,670
at the beginning.

90
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,159
I didn't think

91
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,670
Bai Li was worth all your effort.

92
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,710
But I knew

93
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,750
I couldn't stop you.

94
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,870
To me, my career

95
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,430
doesn't matter.

96
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,870
Thank you for doing all this for her.

97
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,350
It's the least I could do.

98
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,270
Su Yu.

99
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,470
You love her so much.

100
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,590
Why didn't you tell her?

101
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,590
I naively thought

102
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,890
I had all the time in the world to tell her about my feelings,

103
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,710
but in the end,

104
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:55,909
I still couldn't muster the courage to take that step.

105
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,630
Is that what you meant by "Gather and disperse;

106
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,190
be intentional in love?"

107
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,110
But it's too late now.

108
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,950
Bai Li is in a coma.

109
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,320
I can't tell her how I feel anymore.

111
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,510

I wanted to fulfill Bai Li's wish

if we had been more honest with each other,

This matter didn't make any sense.

174
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,030
Why did my brother-in-law admit that he plagiarized

175
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,290
and ruined his career?

176
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,430

I don't care about Ye Yunkai.

00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,870

180
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,200
Zhaoxiong, don't be angry.

00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,600
It's bad for your health.

Dad, do you think

183
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,550
my sister knew Su Yu plagiarized all the time

184
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,710
but kept us in the dark?

185
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,710
Xi, that's nonsense.

186
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,910

187
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,830
Chen is the daughter of the Ning family.

188
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,640
How's it possible that she colluded with outsiders against her own family?

189
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,270
My sister has always been unpredictable.

190
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,320
You should be too ashamed to come back.

191
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,270
Tell me.

192
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,510
What's going on between you and Su Yu?

193
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,170
I know you don't want to see me.

194
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,950
So I'm back to pack my things and move out

195
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,310
so that I won't upset you.

196
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,750
Cut the crap.

197
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,110
Get out of my sight.

198
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,350
[S&YU Jewelry Design Corporation]

199
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,950
I hope the information in it

200
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,210
can help you find out the truth back then.

201
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,550
How did you get it?

202
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,740
What are you doing here?

203
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,950
Dad doesn't allow us to come to the study.

204
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,080
Have you forgotten?

205
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,450
He never allows me to come here,

206
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,010
so I want to take a look at it

207
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:30,990
before I leave.

208
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,680
I've suddenly thought of an old joke.

209
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,720
Dad loves his trophies so much.

210
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,620
If one day we fall into the water with them,

211
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,120
who will Dad save first?

212
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,200
Boring.

213
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,350
I'll delve into these files in the next few days

214
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,640
to find out the truth,

215
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,320
and then I'll go to Ning Zhaoxiong

216
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,180
to settle things once and for all.

217
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,270
I'll go with you.

218
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:12,800
Don't worry.

219
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,220
I won't rat you out.

220
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,370
That's not what I mean.

221
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,670
I just want to be there for you.

222
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,950
This is my personal affair.

223
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,420
I have to face it alone.

224
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,850
You've helped me a lot.

225
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,930
I'm already very grateful.

226
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,710
I don't want to put you on the spot in the Ning family

227
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,000
because of this.

228
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,230
Now that Ye Yunkai is out of the picture,

229
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,070
regarding the plagiarism accusations against you,

230
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,270
isn't it time you spoke up and cleared your name?

231
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,430
Now, I just want to know what happened to my family back then.

232
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,360
But

233
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,050
I feel like someone's manipulating public opinion this time.

234
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,890
It doesn't matter.

235
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,220
When I made this decision,

236
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,990
I braced myself for everything.

237
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,510
You don't need to worry about me.

238
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,980
Go to the PR department

239
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,930
and have a word with our friends in the media.

240
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,350
Tell them to fan the flames a little bit

241
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:16,150
and escalate Su Yu's plagiarism scandal.

242
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,290
That way,

243
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,230
we'll be impacted too, won't we?

244
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,110
Su Yu's reputation has been ruined because of this scandal.

245
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,310
However,

246
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,000
with good PR,

247
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,470
he's competent enough

248
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,460
to make a comeback in the market

249
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:39,130
after the buzz fades away.

250
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,780
Mr. Ning, what's your plan?

251
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,820
Although his reputation is tarnished,

252
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,200
he still has a silver jewelry production line

253
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,940
and some supply chains.

254
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:57,840
He's also got talented designers on his team.

255
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,830
Once his company's market value hits rock bottom,

256
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,070
we'll buy it out.

257
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,650
It'll be a steal.

258
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,720
Mr. Ning, you're far-sighted.

259
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,590
But it's quite strange, isn't it?

260
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,510
Su Yu is involved in such a big scandal,

261
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,190
but since that press conference,

262
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,770
he hasn't made any public appearances

263
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,080
or formal responses.

264
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,670
I wonder what he's thinking.

265
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,470
Yeah.

266
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:31,840
Mr. Ning.

267
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,430
Mr. Su from S&YU Jewelry suddenly came.

268
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,690
Do you want to meet him?

269
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:35,950
He's here?

270
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,660
I wasn't expecting him.

271
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,190
Let him in.

272
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,400
Why have you come?

273
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,890
Shouldn't you ask me to take a seat first?

274
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,680
You set me up twice.

275
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,700
It's already really nice of me

276
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,020
to let you in.

277
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,290
The negative public opinion about me

278
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,220
hasn't died down over time.

279
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,970
Instead, it's gotten worse.

280
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:15,520
Mr. Ning,

281
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:18,290
that's exactly what you want, isn't it?

282
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,720
What do you mean?

283
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,800
You played the same old trick again.

284
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,599
It's indeed something you'd do.

285
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,040
What are you getting at?

286
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,550
Mr. Ning.

287
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,500
Do you remember someone

288
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,240
called Yi Chengyu?

289
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,190
Does it matter

290
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,840
if I do or not?

291
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,310
Let me tell you a story.

292
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,640
It can definitely remind you of him.

293
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,850
Years ago,

294
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,300
there was a company called Chengyu Jewelry.

295
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,270
It didn't have much influence nationwide

296
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,670
but dominated the local market.

297
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,710
Even Ningmei had a hard time

298
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,230
competing with it for market share.

299
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:09,610
Surprisingly, the owners of these two companies

300
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,450
became good friends.

301
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,360
But suddenly, one day,

302
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,680
Chengyu was reported for selling counterfeits.

303
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,870
The media quickly followed up,

304
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,950
and all kinds of negative news flooded in.

305
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,310
Chengyu's store was filled with people

306
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,570
protesting and returning the products.

307
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:33,970
In the end,

308
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,670
it closed down very soon.

309
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,070
That happened so many years ago.

310
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,040
Why did you bring it up now?

311
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,610
Mr. Ning, be patient.

312
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,370
Hear me out.

313
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,110
After Chengyu's owner, Yi Chengyu, went bankrupt,

314
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:01,040
he was seen as an unscrupulous businessman and lived a miserable life.

315
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,960
His wife left him,

316
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,660
and he eventually died of depression.

317
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,320
Meanwhile, his good friend, Ning Zhaoxiong,

318
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,970
kicked him while he was down

319
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:13,230
and quickly took over the entire market.

320
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:18,270
Yi Chengyu brought it upon himself by selling counterfeits.

321
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,590
I merely expanded my business.

322
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,910
Expanded your business?

323
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,630
Then how do you explain this?

324
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,390
Yi Chengyu

325
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,600
was my father.

326
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,390
What on earth do you want?

327
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,340
You'd better give me a satisfactory answer.

328
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,410
Otherwise,

329
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,850
I'll destroy Ningmei

330
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,140
and make sure the Ning family will never have peace.

331
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,340
You want to expose these things,

332
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,080
but given your current ability,

333
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,030
you're not capable enough to bring me down.

334
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,110
I have evidence of all the illegal things

335
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,750
Ningmei has been involved in over the years.

336
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,680
If you don't believe me,

337
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,280
just keep reading.

338
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,300
You should feel relieved that I've found out

339
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,650
the person who spread the fake news back then wasn't you.

340
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,260
The instigator who spread the fake news,

341
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,410
also the biggest beneficiary behind the scenes,

342
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,730
was your wife,

343
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,200
Chen Ling.

344
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,950
I didn't expect

345
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,050
Chen Ling to have done so many things behind my back.

346
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,430
What are you going to do?

347
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,720
You must be in a great mood today.

348
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,550
[Floating Clouds]

349
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,110
I've slept well

350
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,150
and eaten well these days.

351
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:12,880
I feel great.

352
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,540
Don't celebrate yet.

353
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,390
Who knows what Ning Mochen will do next?

354
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,090
What can she do?

355
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,790
Su Yu was the only person who could make her look good in front of Dad,

356
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,450
but he's like a street rat now.

357
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,200
Everyone hates him.

358
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:29,070
I don't think she can bounce back this time.

359
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,070
I didn't expect that

360
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,910
they were so stupid

361
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,590
that they ruined themselves without us doing anything.

362
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,590
How convenient.

363
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,150
Anyway, you've worried a lot in the past few days, Mom.

364
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,950
I bought this for you.

365
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,670
Take it.

366
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,500
You don't need to buy me a gift.

367
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,830
Just treat me well in the future.

368
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,510
Why did you call me back?

369
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,500
Chen, you're back.

370
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:26,680
I thought you'd never come home.

371
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,820
Chen set up the Ning family,

372
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,090
but she's still part of this family.

373
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,550
Of course she'd come home.

374
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,990
But, Mr. Su,

375
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,720
you're currently swamped with negative news,

376
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,430
and your personal image has taken a hit.

377
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,280
Not to mention the fines for contract breaches

378
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,920
and the pressure from public opinion across the board.

379
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,990
I bet everyone in your company is disconcerted now.

380
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,100
You must have a ton of issues to sort out.

381
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,870
It's surprising that you've found the time

382
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,400
to drop by our house.

383
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,810
Dad, don't be soft-hearted.

384
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:58,280
Although Mr. Su and my sister are engaged,

385
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:03,470
he's notorious in the industry now.

386
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,630
We need to cut ties with someone like him.

387
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:07,450
Shut up.

388
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,600
You think that's too harsh?

389
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:10,670
Xi,

390
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,950
your sister seems to

391
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,440
really care for Mr. Su.

392
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:18,400
She's still defending him after all he's done.

393
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,630
How touching.

394
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:23,350
It's just that Mr. Su is involved in such a scandal

395
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,830
and has affected Chen.

396
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,100
We have to keep our distance from him.

397
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,790
The reputation the Ning family has built up over the years

398
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:34,310
can't be ruined by some random guy.

399
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:35,750
Xi,

400
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,640
you can't say that.

401
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,230
The Ning family always has good manners.

402
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,510
No matter what others do,

403
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,430
we must not lose our manners.

404
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,680
After all, we don't know when your sister and your brother-in-law

405
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,720
will come home again.

406
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,370
Are you done?

407
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,970
I gathered everyone here

408
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,900
for a family matter.

409
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,190
I declare

410
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:12,970
that from now on, I and your stepmother, Chen Ling,

411
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,760
are not long husband and wife.

412
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,930
Zhaoxiong.

413
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,670
Is this a joke?

414
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,330
Do I look like I'm joking?

415
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,300
Well…

416
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,310
Did I say something too harsh just now

417
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,370
and make you angry?

418
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,150
Dad.

419
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,670
Mom cares for the Ning family,

420
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:44,590
so she couldn't help but nag a little bit.

421
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,510
Why are you so angry?

422
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,140
There was a local jewelry merchant

423
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,650
called Yi Chengyu.

424
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,180
Do you remember him?

425
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:57,640
That was a long time ago.

426
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,640
-Why are you…
-He was a good friend of mine.

427
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,300
You framed him behind my back.

428
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,560
Don't you feel guilty about him and me?

429
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,830
N-No.

430
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,150
Why would I…

431
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:06,990
Shut up!

432
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,790
You not only did unscrupulous things

433
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,730
but also did them in my name

434
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:15,080
and in the name of Ningmei Jewelry.

435
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:15,990
Dad.

436
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,710
What on earth did Mom do?

437
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,870
Do you know who he is?

438
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,750
He's Yi Chengyu's son.

439
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,190
Look at these.

440
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,150
Back then,

441
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,270
I wanted you to acquire Chengyu Jewelry,

442
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:43,620
but you bribed reporters and witnesses behind my back

443
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,830
and accused Yi Chengyu of selling counterfeits.

444
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,750
You even hired thugs and idlers

445
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,000
to make a scene in his store.

446
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,430
How could you do such a despicable thing?

447
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,270
You ruined a family!

448
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,320
Ning Zhaoxiong.

449
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:01,260
You tacitly agreed to all these things back then.

450
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,870
You did something wrong,

451
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,930
and worse, you left behind evidence.

452
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,640
You're so useless.

453
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,430
Zhaoxiong.

454
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,580
I've served you for so many years.

455
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,620
Can you forgive me this time?

456
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,310
Zhaoxiong.

457
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,110
We've been married for so many years.

458
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,620
How can you just divorce me like this?

459
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,590
We love each other.

460
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,130
My lawyer

461
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,800
will talk to you later about the divorce.

462
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,470
Xi, talk to your dad for me.

463
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,870
He's just mad at me now.

464
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,010
Mom.

465
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,500
I can't believe someone died because of you!

466
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,210
Talk to your dad for me.

467
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,280
You're your dad's favorite daughter.

468
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,960
He'll listen to you.

469
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,510
If you leave now,

470
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:09,060
I'll give you some money for old times' sake.

471
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,210
If you keep pestering me,

472
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,750
I promise you won't get a penny.

473
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,640
How can you…

474
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,040
Su Yu.

475
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,130
Is this what you want?

476
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,860
Working in the jewelry industry.

477
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,330
Getting engaged with Ning Mochen.

478
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,450
Collaborating with Ningmei.

479
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,440
You've been waiting for this day.

480
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:45,630
Yes.

481
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:03,550
You,

482
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:04,920
you,

483
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,260
and you.

484
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:09,990
You can all go to hell.

485
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,830
You can all go to hell!

486
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,510
None of you will end up well.

487
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,750
You can all go to hell!

488
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,830
Get your hands off me!

489
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,610
You can all go to hell!

490
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,270
Go to hell!

491
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,400
Are you satisfied with this result?

492
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,720
It was because of Chen Ling that my father died.

493
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,180
But you know very well

494
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,460
what you have done.

495
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,300
Ning Zhaoxiong.

496
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,330
Behave yourself.

497
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:10,990
Let's go.

498
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,020
You're leaving already?

499
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:38,840
Yes.

500
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,270
Ning Mochen.

501
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,320
Thank you.

502
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,000
Don't mention it.

503
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,390
You helped me too.

504
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,480
Thank you for helping me find evidence of Chen Ling framing my dad.

505
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,480
After all these years, I could finally clear his name.

506
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,950
Now that Bai Li

507
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,710
is in the custody of her family,

508
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,600
I can finally be relieved.

509
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,390
How about you?

510
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,780
You've lost a lot too.

511
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,960
How is your company now?

512
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,660
It doesn't matter anymore.

513
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:19,830
I heard from Ning Moxi that your company's reputation is damaged

514
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,250
and you need to pay fines for contract breaches.

515
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,580
Can you handle it alone?

516
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,190
I can help you.

517
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,850
No, thanks.

518
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,350
Our cooperation is over.

519
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:31,200
You have no obligation to help me anymore.

520
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,070
Have you packed everything?

521
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,910
Don't leave anything behind.

522
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,670
I didn't bring many things with me.

523
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:52,580
Staying at your place was just a show for them.

524
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:53,950
Now,

525
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,620
we don't have to act for them anymore.

526
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,460
No.

527
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,420
We don't have to act anymore.

528
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,300
I'll miss the breakfast you made.

529
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,800
It was delicious.

530
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,480
Are you hungry now?

531
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:15,390
Yes.
