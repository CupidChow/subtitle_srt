11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,320
My coffee.

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,530
You won't be late even if you spared time to say hi, customer.

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,890
Hey, is someone chasing you or something?

14
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,460
I have an appointment so I need to go.

15
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:46,770
You're here,

16
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:47,830
sir.

17
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,920
What's with this mood.

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,710
Even I'm feeling awkward.

19
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,450
I guess you went

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,140
somewhere nice yesterday.

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,630
Did you go on a date

22
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,069
with the person you like?

23
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,120
Wonyoung, you seem to be a very curious person.

24
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:09,810
But,

25
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,410
don't you think it's rude

26
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:15,750
to ask about something so personal?

27
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:33,350
Hey!

28
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,530
Cha Jooheon!

29
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,070
Why are you suddenly acting like that towards Wonyoung?

30
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,250
Mind your own business.

31
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,090
Hey!

32
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,130
I'm not done talking.

33
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,509
Are you not going to let go?

34
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,470
Oh gosh.

35
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,600
After you're done with work today,

36
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,030
come have a drink with me.

37
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,329
Hey Kim Donghee,

38
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,350
let's date.

39
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,730
Hey Kim Donghee,

40
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:22,780
ah just

41
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,750
date me for a month!

42
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,800
How come there isn't a single normal person in this tiny neighborhood.

43
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,540
Hey,

44
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,540
why are you including me?

45
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,840
You, who still clings onto your crush from high school

46
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,579
and him

47
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,160
who doesn't know anything and just asks to date for a month.

48
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,870
What about you?

49
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,890
It's not like you're a spy but you never open up about your past.

50
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,750
Then there's a guy who moved here to Gangneung

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,930
just because he wants to learn something from you.

52
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,180
You're right,

53
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,910
both you and I

54
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,390
have these guys clinging onto us.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,540
Hey,

56
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,790
I'm not being clung onto, okay?

57
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,740
If this was a traffic accident, he's the only one responsible.

58
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,730
I didn't do anything but he hit me.

59
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,060
Then just report him.

60
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,260
If you show it with your actions,

61
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,490
he might actually run away.

62
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,579
I can't do that.

63
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,579
If I do that auntie will find out.

64
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,120
I cannot do that.

65
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,270
You're seriously...

66
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,340
so helpless.

67
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,250
Hey,

68
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:38,460
that's enough talk about me,

69
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,290
how can you do that to Wonyoung?

70
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,579
How could you say something like that to his face?

71
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,100
After you left,

72
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,750
he looked so disheartened.

73
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,480
I felt so bad for him.

74
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,310
I thought you told me to remember

75
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:57,940
that he's only someone who's passing by.

76
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,270
True.

77
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,930
I'll know once we spend some time apart.

78
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,180
Know?

79
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,150
Know what?

80
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,650
How different I treated him lately

81
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,490
compared to before.

82
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,370
Wow...

83
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,140
so you're like this when you're in a relationship.

84
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,680
I'm starting to stand on Wonyoung's side.

85
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,990
Look after him these days

86
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,750
and buy him some good food.

87
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,740
Okay.

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,380
He's with Hotae today

89
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,880
so he should be fine.

90
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,310
What?

91
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,420
Why with him?

92
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,270
Why are they together?

93
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,670
They're going to the bookstore to buy GED textbooks.

94
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,530
Just the two of them?

95
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:41,200
Yeah.

96
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,150
Why are you only telling me this now?

97
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,170
What's wrong with you suddenly?

98
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,020
What's the problem?

99
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,810
I don't know. Hey I can't tie it, help me.

100
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,800
Come on, tie it properly.

101
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,850
Wonyoung, you seem to be a very curious person.

102
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,480
But,

103
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,480
don't you think it's rude

104
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,610
to ask about something so personal?

105
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,660
Ugh.

106
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,100
They don't have that book right now

107
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,610
so they'll contact us when it's in stock.

108
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:40,310
I think this is enough.

109
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:41,730
Let's go.

110
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,960
Hey, wait.

111
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,210
Before we leave I have something to say.

112
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,700
Last time,

113
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,490
when I was talking with Donghee,

114
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,659
you heard everything, right?

115
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,310
Ah... that...

116
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,120
I didn't mean to peek...

117
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,159
I mean, I didn't peek...

118
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,240
But in the end I technically did peek...

119
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,330
Don't be scared.

120
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,030
I'm not trying to blame you.

121
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,400
But,

122
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,780
I wasn't joking about what I said

123
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,080
and I'm going to continue saying it

124
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,410
so if you feel uncomfortable you should tell me now.

125
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,190
You can just tell my mom

126
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,650
that I didn't want to study with you.

127
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:29,970
I'm fine.

128
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,830
Liking someone

129
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,650
isn't a wrong thing.

130
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,380
You surprised me, part-timer.

131
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,800
Ah, it's actually raining.

132
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,940
I was too lazy to bring an umbrella.

133
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,920
Take the taxi with me.

134
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,000
You helped me pick my textbooks

135
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,360
so I'll drop you off.

136
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,520
No, it's okay.

137
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,080
I'll try to catch a taxi,

138
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,150
so wear this for now.

139
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:13,960
I can...

140
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,880
Brother from the plate shop?

141
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,720
Sir.

142
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,260
There,

143
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,990
that's the taxi I took.

144
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,430
Take that one and go first.

145
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,540
Okay.

146
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,860
See you tomorrow part-timer.

147
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,430
Go home safe!

148
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,620
How did you come here?

149
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,310
Were you passing by?

150
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,650
Did you not watch the weather forecast?

151
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,080
Why didn't you bring an umbrella?

152
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,340
I thought it'd be wrong

153
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,980
because it didn't rain during the day.

154
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,300
There's no way to make it rain from the morning.

155
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,650
You're just

156
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,140
not prepared.

157
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,290
What do you mean not prepared?

158
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,850
There's nothing wrong with getting rained on.

159
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,650
It's not like I'll die if I get rained on.

160
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,000
I can just take the bus,

161
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,420
so you should leave, sir.

162
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,210
This isn't the way to the bus station.

163
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,700
I have a lot on my mind so I'm going to walk.

164
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:47,950
Ah, wait.

165
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,660
Did you drink?

166
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,400
But you said you don't usually drink.

167
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,820
I guess you have a lot of worries.

168
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,290
Is it about love?

169
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,330
It's rude of me to ask this, right?

170
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,050
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,130
Seriously,

172
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,290
why are you still following me?

173
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,640
I'm worried you'll get rained on

174
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,740
if it starts raining again.

175
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,420
Ah seriously...

176
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,500
Are you okay?

177
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,020
Sir you must be disappointed...

178
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,370
if it were a female student,

179
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,130
you'd probably be more nervous.

180
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,270
Just because it's a man,

181
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,050
you don't think I'll feel the same?

182
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,200
Stop it, you're confusing me.

183
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,460
I'm already having a hard time with my feelings.

184
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,750
But if you keep doing this

185
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,670
I'll keep getting confused.

186
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,880
What is it?

187
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,820
What are

188
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,580
those feelings?

189
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,400
To be honest...

190
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,050
Answer it.

191
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,040
I don't have to answer this call.

192
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:35,830
To be honest?

193
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,950
Um...

194
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,510
just forget it.

195
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,050
I was being a bit mean, right?

196
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,220
I think it's because lately

197
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,770
you've been treating me coldly

198
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,140
so I was a bit upset.

199
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,650
I guess I unconsciously threw a tantrum.

200
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,290
If you're busy, of course

201
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,600
you won't be able to pay attention to me

202
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,650
but I'm just like this.

203
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,270
If you're nice to me I get attached.

204
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,300
You are

205
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:13,610
allowed to do that.

206
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,160
You ended up staying here

207
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,250
because of me.

208
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,330
I'm sorry,

209
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,080
for upsetting you.

210
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,080
No,

211
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,060
I'm sorry.

212
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,510
Since we both apologized,

213
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,780
starting tomorrow,

214
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,360
let's greet each other with a smile

215
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,100
Go home.

216
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,000
Why does he seem so tired...

217
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,130
You ended up staying here

218
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,260
because of me.

219
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,270
So that's why he's been so kind to me.

220
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,440
Makes sense...

221
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,440
he's someone with a strong sense of responsibility.

222
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,880
I'm here.

223
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:28,830
Brother.

224
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,010
Brother Donghee are you sick?

225
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:32,780
Brother!

226
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,410
Oh...

227
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,590
Ah... I'm not sober...

228
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,660
Did you drink a lot?

229
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,890
Yeah...

230
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,840
Cha Jooheon that jerk suddenly left yesterday,

231
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,560
so I finished the rest of the liquor by myself...

232
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,680
Did you drink with him yesterday?

233
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,160
Yeah.

234
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:55,140
Ah,

235
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,040
but did you guys meet yesterday?

236
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,110
How do you know that?

237
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,570
He left after I told him

238
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,800
that you were buying GED textbooks with Hotae

239
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,010
so I know.

240
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:07,880
Ah...

241
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,640
I thought I just ran into him coincidentally.

242
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,420
Oh my... Wonyoung.

243
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,000
There is no such thing

244
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,650
as a coincidence in this world.

245
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,210
The things that we believe to be miracles,

246
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,590
are all someone's hard work...

247
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,910
I need to go to the bathroom.

248
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,040
So he came to me on purpose?

249
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:40,760
Why?

250
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,880
What are you thinking about? You didn't even notice me coming in.

251
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,560
Ah, you're here.

252
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,270
I'll make your coffee right away.

253
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:10,770
Is there something going on?

254
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,260
No.

255
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,190
Are you sick again?

256
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,170
No,

257
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,350
I'm okay.

258
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:20,700
Hey!

259
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,250
Hey!

260
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,220
Stop bothering him.

261
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,060
Did you not have the hangover soup?

262
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,940
How can I go there right now.

263
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:34,800
Ah,

264
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,600
Wonyoung are you free on our day off next week?

265
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:40,730
Why?

266
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,740
I wasn't asking you.

267
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,700
I'm free.

268
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,130
Then save some time for me next week.

269
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,290
Is there something wrong?

270
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,290
No,

271
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,040
I just have free hotel tickets

272
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,390
and thought we should go on a workers trip together.

273
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,570
Also to celebrate your birthday.

274
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,100
Your birthday's next week?

275
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,490
Oh right...

276
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,300
next Tuesday.

277
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,930
Cha Jooheon, of course you'll say

278
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,200
"I'll pass", right?

279
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,920
So I'm not even going to ask you.

280
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:12,780
Oh...

281
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,150
it's actually a good thing.

282
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:16,170
I was planning on

283
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,060
going on a trip anyways.

284
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:20,250
Ah~ I see.

285
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:22,339
You're going, right?

286
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,390
Why did you bring so many things?

287
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,520
Is it food?

288
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,320
What is this?

289
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,860
Light bulbs and wires?

290
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,220
Yeah, I'm trying to make something.

291
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,170
What's going on?

292
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,470
It's been so long since you've decided to make something.

293
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,410
You're going to Yeoju next month to look at clay, right?

294
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:52,940
Yeah.

295
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,170
Let's go together.

296
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,880
What~

297
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,900
Are you really going to start crafting again?

298
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,750
Wow, this is exciting.

299
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,380
Senior, you're using the kiln the day after tomorrow, right?

300
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,150
Yeah.

301
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,560
Ah then that's not enough time...

302
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,920
Why? Is it something urgent?

303
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,060
Wait...

304
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,300
then I'll need to finish it up for you.

305
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:17,510
Why?

306
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,500
You have to go to China the day after tomorrow

307
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,830
for some seminar.

308
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,840
Why am I going there?

309
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,470
You didn't know?

310
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,600
Your father contacted me.

311
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,850
He said there's a seminar in Beijing

312
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,440
and that you must go.

313
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,750
He said he already told the officials.

314
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,400
I'm going crazy.

315
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,480
I told you that he knows you're here.

316
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,180
Ah,

317
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,200
now I feel awkward.

318
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,650
Business trip to Beijing?

319
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,190
Yeah.

320
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,560
I suddenly have to go on a business trip to Beijing.

321
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,150
Why?

322
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:00,900
You're going to sell plates in China?

323
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,420
Do they like your plates?

324
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,140
Ah...

325
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,270
it's not like that.

326
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,580
I'm sorry,

327
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:12,860
it's you're birthday.

328
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,820
It's okay. -I arrive that day in the morning.

329
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,860
I'll go meet up with you guys as soon as I'm back.

330
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,680
You don't have to push yourself like that,

331
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,940
you're busy after all.

332
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,740
I said I will celebrate your birthday,

333
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,960
so I'm going to go even if I'm late.

334
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,600
When are you leaving?

335
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,150
Tomorrow morning.

336
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,620
What kind of business trip...

337
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,080
Goodbye!

338
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,170
(Vice-manager Jung Seonho)

339
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:31,060
(Vice-manager Jung Seonho)

340
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,800
Yes, vice-manager Jung.

341
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,260
Wonyoung, did something happen these days?

342
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,290
Ah, no.

343
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,780
You hung up on me

344
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,800
and didn't call back

345
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,230
so I thought something happened.

346
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,300
Is there an update on the progress?

347
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,070
Has he gone anywhere

348
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,610
or met anyone?

349
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,960
There's nothing special going on.

350
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,000
I see.

351
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,050
Right now the company

352
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,940
is depending on you.

353
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:01,870
You know that, right?

354
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:02,570
Yes.

355
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,530
Apparently Beijing is colder than here.

356
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:09,760
Wonyoung.

357
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,940
I'm taking a break due to personal reasons.

358
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,380
I hope for your understanding.

359
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,500
I miss him...

360
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,280
I told you to study but all you did was coloring.

361
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,090
This,

362
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,680
I told you you can't get this one wrong.

363
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,960
Hm? You got this one right again.

364
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,140
I bet you guessed it.

365
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,080
Look, you got these all wrong.

366
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,720
It's okay,

367
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,150
I'll teach you again from the start.

368
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,620
Ah, I don't know.

369
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,340
Ah, nevermind, I'm not doing it!

370
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,230
You can do it.

371
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:15,990
This is

372
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,070
you and Donghee, right?

373
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:18,650
Yeah.

374
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,230
Have you guys been friends since you were young?

375
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,310
My mom and Donghee's mom are friends,

376
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,580
so we knew each other since we were born.

377
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,000
Ah~

378
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:28,850
I see.

379
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,540
Hey.

380
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:39,080
What?

381
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,310
Didn't you used to

382
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,370
have a girlfriend?

383
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:45,900
Then how did you...

384
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,940
accept the fact that

385
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,930
you like Donghee?

386
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,190
Accept?

387
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:54,410
Accept what?

388
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,550
Like...

389
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,580
it could be out of compassion

390
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
or just a misconception.

391
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:03,850
What kind of nonsense is that?

392
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,740
No...

393
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,050
like...

394
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,210
with feelings...

395
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,310
Ah... so complicated.

396
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,620
I mean,

397
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,960
liking someone is done by the heart.

398
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,440
So why are you asking about compassion and misconceptions

399
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,010
which are done by the brain?

400
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,130
Do I not know because I'm simple-minded?

401
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,260
Do people usually separate this?

402
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,080
What are you trying to say?

403
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,990
I just like Kim Donghee.

404
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,430
I shouldn't have asked.

405
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,360
Let's continue with class.

406
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,250
Part-timer...

407
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,140
Are you not going to open your book?

408
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,180
You,

409
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,840
like the brother from the plate shop, right?

410
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,620
Ah...

411
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,040
Gosh, though I can't solve these problems,

412
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,800
my intuition is always right.

413
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,460
Ah...

414
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:09,840
about that...

415
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,290
You haven't even told him yet, right?

416
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,560
Why are you thinking about it so seriously?

417
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,910
Just confess to him.

418
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:17,840
Even if you fail,

419
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,250
you'll be in a better state than me.

420
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,280
Hotae,

421
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,850
you've always been close with Donghee brother.

422
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,160
So even if you say something out of the blue like that,

423
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,900
you won't ruin your relationship with him completely.

424
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,340
But it's different for me.

425
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,270
If I make a mistake,

426
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,090
we might go back to being strangers

427
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:39,970
because I haven't known him for that long.

428
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:46,830
Hey, part-timer.

429
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,940
Let's finish up quickly

430
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,240
and then go for some soju, okay?

431
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:53,640
Ah, but

432
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,950
I'm going on a trip tomorrow.

433
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:56,800
A trip?

434
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:58,560
What about the cafe?

435
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,780
You didn't know?

436
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,880
We're going on a cafe workers trip tomorrow.

437
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,410
What?

438
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,560
Ugh Kim Donghee didn't even tell me.

439
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,490
So this is how you're going to treat me.

440
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,900
Part-timer, you'll need to help me.

441
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,360
It should be here...

442
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:41,710
Why are you in such poor condition?

443
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:42,620
What?

444
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,180
You drank yesterday, didn't you?

445
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,270
No, I didn't.

446
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,740
So suspicious...

447
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:52,880
Hello?

448
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,900
The car's not here yet, sir.

449
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,200
But I made a reservation.

450
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:00,760
What?

451
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,130
You don't remember?

452
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,310
Wait, how...

453
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,690
Hello?

454
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,820
Hello? Sir? Hello?

455
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:13,560
Hey!

456
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,130
Get in!

457
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,610
That crazy...

458
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:21,170
Go Hotae! You stole that car, didn't you?

459
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:21,910
Go take it back!

460
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,050
I didn't steal it, okay?

461
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,060
Hey, I even woke up early and went grocery shopping.

462
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:31,630
You're the one who cancelled the rental car, right?

463
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,420
Hurry and get in!

464
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,700
Hurry and get in? Ugh!

465
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,260
Ugh! I should just!

466
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:38,760
Ugh!

467
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,710
You're telling me to go in this trash car?

468
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,160
Does that even make sense? I'm not going!

469
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,200
I'm not going!

470
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:57,590
Hey,

471
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:01,280
do it properly if you want to at least sleep on the floor.

472
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:02,910
I am doing it properly.

473
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,670
If you date me for a month,

474
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:27,360
I'll do it even more properly.

475
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,460
Ugh!

476
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,260
What? What?

477
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,080
We're holding hands.

478
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,770
Is he really busy...

479
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,340
He didn't even text me that he got the present.

480
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,280
This isn't even important.

481
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,520
I sure like to put meaning on everything.

482
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:22,540
Wonyoung,

483
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,250
I guess Mr. Yoon didn't tell you

484
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,370
that he was coming to the seminar in China.

485
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:27,940
Did you not know?

486
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,070
Anyways, I met him so it's fine.

487
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:38,560
But,

488
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,110
Mr. Yoon has zero sense in fashion.

489
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,580
He's wearing a suit with a fur scarf.

490
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,440
Are you okay?

491
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:23,870
Sir!

492
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,720
Were you waiting for my call?

493
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,190
You answered right away.

494
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,350
I thought you would contact me at least once.

495
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,280
I was busy with my schedule

496
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:37,950
because I was trying to finish it quickly.

497
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:39,840
Are you done with the busy work?

498
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,030
When are you coming?

499
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,520
Turn around.

500
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:54,220
♫ I fallen for you ♫

501
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,910

510
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,760
I cancelled my nighttime schedule and took the plane.

511
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,200
I'm sorry I couldn't contact you.

512
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,300
I heard that when learning how to use the pottery wheel,

513
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,710
the teacher doesn't have to hug the student like that.

514
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,560
♫ My heart got stolen without me realizing it ♫

515
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,610

From now on I'm going to do something crazy,

530
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,560

00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,080
Sir, the person you like...

549
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,429
isn't it Aeri from the carpentry shop...

550
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:34,949
It's you.

551
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:37,130
I prepared for his birthday party but he disappears?

552
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:37,900
But I like it.

553
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,250
Don't like it.

554
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,159
My niece is pretty and popular.

555
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:42,900
No, I

556
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:44,840
never asked for a blind date.

557
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,820
Hey, did you not know that I like you?

558
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:49,870
Thank you

559
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:51,060
for coming to me.

560
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,469
Just don't lie.

561
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,510
I was wrong.

562
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,889
I won't do it again.

563
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:59,950
♫ I will be stronger ♫

564
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:05,660
♫ I can't stop my heart from running to you now ♫
