00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,850
I guess it's true that he was dismissed from his position.

12
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,100
That's too bad, it's only his second year working here...

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,050
What do you mean too bad. Employees are always just like their superiors.

18
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,470
Manager Kim?

19
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,510
Manager Kim of the General Affairs Team who was fired due to corruption in procurement?

20
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,610
I was like a robot around Manager Kim who could only ever say "yes" to whatever he said.

21
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,260
Honestly, does it even make sense that he didn't use Manager Kim?

22
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:10,880
Wonyoung!

23
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,960
I saw the announcement, what's going on?

24
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,320
Vice-manager Jung...

25
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,660
Tell me,

26
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:30,490
what's going on?

27
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:32,759
It's just that...

28
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,750
apparently Manager Kim told the disciplinary committee my name

29
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,450
and I really don't know what this is about

30
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,080
but

31
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,120
no one believes me.

32
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,050
What do you mean no one?

33
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,229
I'm kind of offended.

34
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,380
Why? Do you think I don't believe you, too?

35
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:55,660
Manager Kim is known for having bad rumors and behaviors.

36
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,759
Thank you for believing me.

37
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,500
But, what should I do?

38
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,170
I was just starting to work on what you asked for and then this happened.

39
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:03,750
Come on.

40
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,070
You can work on it after you return.

41
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,560
Don't worry about it

42
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,110
and get some rest.

43
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,000
Seems like everything is just a misunderstanding

44
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,540
so you'll be able to come back to work soon.

45
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,780
Thank you.

46
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,400

drink.

52
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,250
Do you still believe the words coming from someone like that?

53
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,280
Why wouldn't I?

54
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,720
How could I have known that Manager Kim would do this.

55
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,640
Come on, no matter who it is, you should know how to reject them if it doesn't feel right.

56
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,130
You should also know how to lie sometimes.

57
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,980
So if someone steals my wallet, I should do the same to others, too?

58
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,720
No, I'm just frustrated because you're always the one getting blamed.

59
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,079
But, if you get fired like this

60
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,730
wouldn't it be hard to get a job at another place?

61
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,300
Someone who got fired for corruption...

62
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,600
who would want that?

63
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,920
Gosh... the feeling of helplessness is overwhelming.

64
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:31,150
I worked so hard to build my resume throughout university...

65
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,390
I still have my student loans to pay off... also my card bills!

66
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,180
Hey,

67
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,870
my dad's debt,

68
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,320
I paid it off with my employee loan but if I quit it means I have to pay it back right away, right?

69
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,160
Oh my god...

70
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,770
you're going to have bad credit.

71
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,290
Shit...

72
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,090
Hey, hey! Whatever!

73
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,740
You should go on trip first.

74
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,000
What...

75
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,310
You've been studying and working nonstop up till now.

76
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,870
If you continue this you're going to die.

77
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,840
Go and clear your mind.

78
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,100
You never know,

79
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,380
during that period the misunderstanding might get solved and you might get your job back.

80
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,010
Drink, let's just drink.

81
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,030
Shit...

82
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,500
Okay, I'll leave!

83
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,550
Come on...

84
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:51,990
Ugh...

85
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,930
are trips usually this difficult...

86
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,220
Ah...

87
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,480
I'm so hungry...

88
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,630
I came all the way here to Gangneung, do I have to eat convenience store ramen..?

89
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,320
Who is it?

90
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,600
Oh really? I'll head up right away!

91
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,030
Yes!

92
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,590
Oh you're here.

93
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:54,310
My husband caught it while fishing, but there's a lot so I wanted to share some.

94
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,909
You do like to eat sashimi, right?

95
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,640
Of course I like it, I can't get enough of it!

96
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,850
Thank you so much!

97
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,720
Enjoy your meal.

98
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,490
I will!

99
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,880
People are so generous here in Gangwon-do.

100
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,260
This is so nice.

101
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:40,920
Assistant Manager Park!

102
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,560
Wonyoung, are you doing well?

103
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,610
Ah...

104
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:46,340
I'm doing alright.

105
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,710
Have you maybe heard of anything about me?

106
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,230
No, not yet.

107
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,140
But I noticed you set up a password for your laptop

108
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,490
I'm taking over your work so...

109
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,080
You must have a lot of work to do because of me,

110
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:03,950
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,470
The password is written on the post-it

112
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,310
under the laptop.

113
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:10,840
There...

114
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,370
Oh, I found it, I found it!

115
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,010
Wonyoung, rest well and I'll see you soon!

116
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,520
Okay...

117
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,770
Take care.

118
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,120
Shit... Manager Kim! I should just..!

119
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,070
Damn it!

120
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:38,070
Oh!

121
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,250
Ugh...

122
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,020
What should I do...

123
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,720
I'm sorry...

124
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,160
Oh... it's alright, as long as you aren't injured it's fine.

125
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:01,010
Oh my god... that's my mom's favorite plate, the one made by the owner, that's my mom's favorite!

126
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,940
Oh my... where did she suddenly pop out from? Haha...

127
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,930
I'm so sorry... if you tell me where the shop is, I'll go buy a new one right away.

128
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,190
Ah... where is it...

129
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,750
Hello ma'am, I was wondering which way I should go to get to Youth Mall?

130
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,200
Ma'am, which way should I go to get to Youth Mall?

131
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,340
Hello!

132
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,440
No one's here...

133
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,770
Hm... it seems pretty similar...

134
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,200
Welcome.

135
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,630
Ah, hello.

136
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,490
Hello.

137
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,970
They don't have the same one...

138
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,070
Is there something

139
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,380
you are looking for?

140
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,580
Ah,

141
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,760
it's a wide plate and it's

142
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:52,730
blue?

143
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,320
Bluish? A type of blue?

144
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,720
Anyways, it was purchased here but I broke it.

145
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,380
Ah, it should be celadon.

146
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,000
You can pick from here.

147
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,740
Just give me whichever, it all looks the same.

148
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,250
Sir,

149
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,510
there is no such thing as the same plate.

150
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,930
Depending on the clay, sometimes extra silica stones are mixed in,

151
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,740
sometimes extra limestones are mixed in,

152
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,630
some are applied with more glaze, some less...

153
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,290
but you never know what it will look like before it goes into the furnace.

154
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,790
Only after it withstands the heat of the furnace,

155
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,500
will its unique color show up.

156
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,750
Sometimes the minerals change within the clay,

157
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,290
and create ones that shine like this one.

158
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:04,800
Wow...

159
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,900
There is no such thing as the same plate in this world.

160
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,180
Just like how every individual has a different way of getting through hard times.

161
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,180
Then...

162
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,340
I'll go with this one.

163
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:29,860
In my eyes, this one seems like the bravest one who overcame it well.

164
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,380
If that's the way you see it,

165
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:38,900
then that's the way it is.

166
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,390
I'll quickly package it up for you.

167
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,670
It's done.

168
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,430
Ah,

169
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:02,870
okay!

170
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,450
Ceramist Yoon Taejoon.

171
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,810
You must already know that he is the chairman's favorite artist.

172
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,100
You know the painter Yoon Seongguk, right?

173
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,650
Of course, he is the most famous painter in our country.

174
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,490
This is his son.

175
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,410
Wow... so he is a young master from a rich family.

176
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,950
Can I go look at some of his works?

177
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,260
But,

178
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,730
didn't he disappear suddenly two years ago?

179
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,290
Around autumn two years ago.

180
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,610
Ha... everyone was put in a tight spot back then.

181
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,440
It was right before the contract.

182
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,020
But why?

183
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,580
I don't know. It made you wonder how it is possible in today's world

184
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,650
to disappear like that without leaving any traces.

185
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,810
He was someone who didn't reveal much of his private life

186
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:10,110
so the only place known is his workshop in Icheon,

187
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,690
but he already cleaned it up beforehand.

188
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,460
There has been no talk about this lately,

189
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,230
but the chairman brought up Mr. Yoon again yesterday.

190
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,480
So?

191
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,900
What do you mean "so"...

192
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,480
We need to find him.

193
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,610
We need to find him.

194
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,340
Hand...

195
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,160
Ah... yes, I need to pay.

196
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,380
Here you go.

197
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,940
Thank you. Thank you!

198
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,040
Wow... Yoon Taejoon is hiding here?

199
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:39,320
Wait...

200
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,360
if this works out well,

201
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,320
won't I be able to get my job back?

202
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,760
Chair...chairman!

203
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,030
Are you...

204
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,430
the one who found Mr. Yoon?

205
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,630
Yes, chairman.

206
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:16,500
I want to give you a small reward

207
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,590
how is it, do you like it?

208
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,510
Chairman!

209
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,800
Chairman!

210
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,420
But,

211
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,220
while they couldn't find this place,

212
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,360
he's been hiding in a place like this..?

213
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,650
Why is he hiding to the extent that he's living under a mask?

214
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,960
Ah, nevermind!

215
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:06,160
It's not like I did anything wrong.

216
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:11,190
Yeah, I'm going to get my job back anyways.

217
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,460
Shit...

218
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,770
Ugh...

219
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:28,610
This favor,

220
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,030
I will pay it back for sure.

221
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,030
Vice-manager Jung!

222
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,150
I found Mr. Yoon Taejoon!

223
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,200
Oh my, did you really go and buy it?

224
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,520
Of course, I have to.

225
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,820
I picked it, but I wasn't sure if you'd like it.

226
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,060
I like it.

227
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,200
There's a lot of pretty plates there, right?

228
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,490
Is it famous?

229
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,950
It's well-known among young mom's in this area.

230
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,240
Rumors travel fast here.

231
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,000
It'd be even more famous if we could promote it on social media.

232
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,670
Oh... you're not allowed to promote it?

233
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,630
That's what I heard.

234
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,140
Plates, shop, the owner, anyways you're not allowed to film anything.

235
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,440
It's rare right? We offered to help promote it but got rejected.

236
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,610
Ah...

237
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,640
That's why they couldn't find it...

238
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,520
Listen carefully,

239
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,640
from now on Wonyoung you are responsible for Mr. Yoon.

240
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,370
Wait but...

241
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,730
isn't it enough that I told you about him?

242
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:47,120
Hey... we need to find out the reason behind his hiding

243
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,410
that way we can have the upper-hand when we sign the contract.

244
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,720
I don't think that's morally right to do...

245
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,570
What does this have to do with morals?

246
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,670
We're just trying to make things smooth for the company.

247
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,380
Usually when artists fall into a slump and disappear,

248
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,910
they need someone to help pull them out.

249
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,240
Have you never thought about helping Mr. Yoon stand back up?

250
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,500
That may be the case but...

251
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:06,940
Wonyoung,

252
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:12,020
right now Taepyeong needs someone honest and sincere like you.

253
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,700
You need to come back to work.

254
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,640
Or are you just going to keep spending time like this?

255
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,020
You remember that our chairman's wish

256
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,990
is to have an exclusive contract with Mr. Yoon, right?

257
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,340
If you do well on this case,

258
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,520
do you think all you will gain in return is getting your job back?

259
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,690
Do you think the chairman will only give you such a small reward?

260
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,680
From now on,

261
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,540
find out as much about Mr. Yoon as possible.

262
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,570
Anything that you are capable of doing,

263
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:44,740
do it all.

264
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,150
Understood?

265
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,670
Yeah,

266
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,490
it's not like it's a bad thing to sign a contract with our company.

267
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,610
Let's do this.

268
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,820
Welcome...

269
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,370
Sir, I'm back again!

270
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,770
Feel free to look around.

271
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,170
There aren't any other workers here.

272
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,110
Do you not need

273
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,830
a part-timer?

274
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,710
No.

275
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,760
That's too bad! There aren't a lot of talents like me...

276
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,020
I'll come back again!

277
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,140
Oh?

278
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,360
Welcome~

279
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,470
You're a bit late.

280
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,810
Yeah, I came from the workshop.

281
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,550
Do you want extra shots?

282
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:13,160
Yes.

283
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,130
Oh? The owner of Moon Jar?

284
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:18,510
Wow, what a coincidence..!

285
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,270
What is it?

286
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,250
Sir, do you really not need a part-timer?

287
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,300
If you had a part-timer, the shop could have stayed open right now.

288
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,160
I don't need one.

289
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,640
Okay...

290
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,230
What?

291
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,360
Who is that?

292
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,360
Why do you keep talking about a part-time job?

293
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,340
I don't need to get paid, you can just give me chores to do...

294
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:47,860
Sir,

295
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,630
if you keep doing this,

296
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,890
I'm going to get mad.

297
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,740
Haha...

298
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,490
I should head back to my store...

299
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:13,990
Sir, you should leave, too.

300
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,650
I'm...

301
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,620
My name is Ji Wonyoung.

302
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,430
I am 27 years old and searching for a job.

303
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,380
I graduated from a pretty good university but I haven't found a job yet.

304
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,180
I came on a trip out of frustration,

305
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:53,950
and was inspired by what you told me about plates last time.

306
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,260
You told me that every individual has their own way of overcoming hardships,

307
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,550
and that got me thinking how maybe I am also just in that process.

308
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,280
While thinking about this,

309
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,060
you could say that I gained courage,

310
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,960
or that I learned something about life's philosophy.

311
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,970
Anyways, it made me want to stick by your side

312
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,730
to see more and learn more.

313
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,680
You said your name is Ji Wonyoung, right?

314
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:21,410
Yes!

315
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,670
Please leave.

316
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,010
Pardon?

317
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,300
It's not working on him... not working.

318
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,730
It's true that I was inspired though...

319
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,550
These oranges are incredibly sweet and tangy today! Please try it, it won't disappoint~

320
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,460
We have sweet and tangy oranges!

321
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,540
We also have chestnuts. Roasted chestnuts!

322
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,830
Chestnuts are on sale~ on sale!

323
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,890
Ma'am, excuse me but

324
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,110
do you know the owner of Moon Jar on the second floor?

325
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,400
Moon Jar?

326
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,610
That's our pottery teacher.

327
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:37,430
Ah~

328
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,220
He's a bit careful

329
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:41,730
and hard to approach.

330
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,630
He doesn't talk to the people in the neighborhood...

331
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,960
But he's very good looking~

332
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,550
Right, he's good looking.

333
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,530
Haha yes.

334
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,340
His friend?

335
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:24,310
Wow, wow!

336
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:26,770
Wow!

337
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,340
Wow even latte art..!

338
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,140
I told you I did a lot of part-time jobs at cafes during university.

339
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,550
I can't believe a talent like you has been hiding in our neighborhood...

340
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,000
Okay, pass!

341
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,680
Can you start working right away?

342
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,600
Of course! What should I do first?

343
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:55,190
We have fresh fruits~

344
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,190
This is really good~

345
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,900
Oh! Wonyoung!

346
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:02,580
Oh! Fruit auntie!

347
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,190
What's with the apron?

348
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,890
I got a job at the cafe on the second floor.

349
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,740
If you want some coffee, call this number.

350
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,250
Oh that's good! I'll order often!

351
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,150
Please do!

352
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:17,680
Okay~

353
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,520
Oh my, it's late. You should hurry and deliver these!

354
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,220
Have a nice day!

355
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,290
Okay~ You got this! -I got this!

356
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,280
So what's in there?

357
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,230
Brother... you scared me...

358
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,000
Let's go eat.

359
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:07,890
Okay.

360
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,990
You're in big trouble now.

361
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,360
Why?

362
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,190
Once you try the hangover soup here,

363
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,070
the one's at other shops will taste horrible.

364
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,790
Oh~ so the food here is good.

365
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,680
Incredibly good.

366
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,220
Auntie! I'll have two bowls of ox bone hangover soup!

367
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:34,640
But...

368
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,670
why do you want to work at Jooheon's shop?

369
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,330
Nevermind,

370
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,680
some day you'll tell me yourself.

371
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,780
It's because of a situation going on.

372
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,400
It's definitely not something bad though.

373
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,840
Okay.

374
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,290
You know before you came,

375
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:57,190
Cha Jooheon would only talk to me?

376
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,380
He's been here since...

377
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:01,800
You scared me!

378
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,010
You're so noisy.

379
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,850
Do you pay rent here?

380
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,270
Enjoy your food.

381
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,430
Auntie, when I ordered earlier he wasn't here for sure.

382
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,980
Why is my mom your auntie? Are you my cousin?

383
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,480
Hey! Aren't you going to call me brother?

384
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:24,440
I would come here every day but I come once every two days because of you okay?

385
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,810
This obsession with the word brother...

386
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,980
I already told you I will bow down if you didn't come here at all.

387
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,490
God that little...

388
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:34,910
Let's hold it, hold it.

389
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,290
You were talking about how long he's been here...

390
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,020
Ah,

391
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,970
he's been here for around two years already

392
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,400
but he never talks about anything personal.

393
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,250
It doesn't seem like he has any relatives here either.

394
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:48,900
How should I put it...

395
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,720
he's a bit hard to approach at the beginning?

396
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:55,820
I see...

397
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:57,350
Let's eat.

398
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:58,630
Okay!

399
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:31,150
It's late, why are you here?

400
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,370
You worked for a long time this time.

401
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,190
You only rested for what, three days?

402
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,370
What are you doing?

403
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:39,900
What?

404
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,120
Ah,

405
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,340
did you see?

406
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,290
Wonyoung started working here since yesterday.

407
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,240
What are you trying to do?

408
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,800
Hm... job creation?

409
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,450
Hey, I barely got by the deficit this month.

410
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:10,020
Even if I want to start delivery services, I need another worker to do so.

411
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,310
But then,

412
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,090
as if it were destined by God, a job seeker shows up right in front of me!

413
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,600
Why wouldn't I use him?

414
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,700
Plus, he's a fast worker and knows latte art!

415
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:21,890
I thought he was Picasso.

416
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,810
Thanks to him, sales have been going up.

417
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,090
I'm back!

418
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,660
Hey Wonyoung~ you're back?

419
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,280
Great work!

420
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,510
I'm not interested.

421
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,550
Alright, thanks for the encouragement.

422
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,150
Please take care of me in the future!

423
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:44,930
I hope there won't be a need for me

424
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,700
to take care of you.

425
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,480
Don't think about it too much. He's just a bit distant that's all.

426
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,160
Oh? He left his syrup here.

427
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,720
Brother! I'll go and give it to him

428
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:18,350
Wow... he's so fast.

429
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,140
He's not here...

430
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:39,760
Oh?

431
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,430
It's Monthly Art.

432
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,450
Sir.

433
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,420
What do you need?

434
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,450
You didn't take your syrup with you.

435
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:12,790
Just leave it there and leave.

436
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,050
Are you not leaving?

437
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:17,980
Excuse me but...

438
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,400
are you mad because of me?

439
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,490
Could you maybe let me off the hook?

Wonyoung you're also interested in pottery?

I do have interest. But for that guy, not pottery.

449
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:44,780
Sir!

450
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,500
What are you doing?

451
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,560
No way, did you drive Wonyoung here after class?

452
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,530
What is this unrealistic feeling?

453
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:51,970
Cafe part-timer?

I told you to not touch me.

456

But... why do you want to know so much about Cha Jooheon?

457
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,000
Well, did you find out anything special?

458
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,150
Oh? Cloud moon jar?

459
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,000
