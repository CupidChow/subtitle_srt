11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,980
Why didn't you pick up?

12
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,310
I was busy.

13
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,920
Why did you call me?

14
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,730
Shouldn't you have at least texted me?

15
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,780
You saw my text.

16
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,980
You also never answered my calls last time.

17
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,990
Nor did you text me.

18
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:41,400
Okay.

19
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,260
I heard that you won't be able to make it tonight,

20
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,460
is that right?

21
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,220
I already called and apologized in advance.

22
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,490
He said he understands.

23
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,340
I can go and pick you up at around 10 P.M.

24
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,720
I'm in Seoul right now.

25
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,270
It's okay.

26
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,770
Will you still be working by then?

27
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,600
Then I'll wait... -No.

28
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:03,310
I just,

29
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,570
don't want to see you.

30
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,600
What...

31
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,550
did you just...

32
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:14,870
I'll hang up now.

33
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,350
I'll go with this one.

34
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,090
In my eyes,

35
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,070
this one seems like the bravest one who overcame it well.

36
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,009
Your left hand

37
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:09,650
just needs to rest here.

38
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,620
I... like you, sir.

39
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,410
I'm sorry for misunderstanding

40
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,020
and confessing on my own.

41
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,220
Are you sure you can live without him?

42
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,290
From what I saw yesterday,

43
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,079
it didn't seem like you can.

44
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,710
(Part 10)

45
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,360
Why?

46
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,970
Why don't you want to see me?

47
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,400
Isn't it a good thing if I don't see you?

48
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,030
I thought you said you're sick of me.

49
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,500
I have feelings and I get hurt, too.

50
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,070
So why are you hurt suddenly?

51
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,540
How come you're okay with him?

52
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,180
Why did you come to Seoul on Christmas Eve

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,310
to meet him?

54
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:47,980
Him?

55
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,329
I saw you guys taking the taxi.

56
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,510
He hurt you so badly yet you still forgave him.

57
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,770
But what about me?

58
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,120
I'm someone you'll never be able to forgive.

59
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,930
I don't like people who hate me.

60
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,670
I really want to stop now.

61
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,769
What is this?

62
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:18,540
Take a look.

63
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,990
This is a pottery exhibition held at Taepyeong Gallery.

64
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,550
It's a special exhibition held by my teacher for students, so I couldn't miss it.

65
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,550
I only have time today

66
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,810
so I scheduled the conference for today. I wanted to go to the company meeting by myself

67
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,630
but that person came without telling me. Also,

68
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,640
about the taxi,

69
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,370
if we wanted to make it on time to the conference,

70
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:43,710
we had no choice but to take it together.

71
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,080
Should I continue?

72
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,680
Then,

73
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,290
while preparing for the exhibition,

74
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,100
you're going to keep... -I'll keep seeing him.

75
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:57,550
But,

76
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,830
he means nothing to me now.

77
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:08,760
You said last time,

78
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,050
that what you need most is something else.

79
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,220
Can I ask

80
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,850
what that is?

81
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:17,660
That's...

82
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,060
to be forgiven by you

83
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,980
for fooling you.

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,800
Then what will happen

85
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,280
after I forgive you?

86
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,760
If you forgive me,

87
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,680
then,

88
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,710
I'll do anything to make it up to you.

89
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,360
If you tell me to quit my job,

90
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,650
I will.

91
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:41,230
If you want me to pay you back by money,

92
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,740
then I'll work hard for the rest of my life.

93
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,580
Is that it?

94
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,710
If you tell me to disappear...

95
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,550
then...

96
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,380
I'll try to do that, too.

97
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,880
Then let's do that.

98
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,880
I'll accept your apology.

99
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,030
Then now it's my turn

100
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,590
to tell you

101
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,230
what I want.

102
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,190
No!

103
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,400
I'm sorry!

104
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,870
I lied again.

105
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,180
Everything else I said is true

106
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,400
but the part where I said I will disappear,

107
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,330
I won't be able to do it.

108
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,500
Just let me

109
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,920
be able to see you from time to time like right now.

110
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,800
I'll be invisible.

111
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,550
You won't even notice me...

112
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,240
I'm sorry,

113
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,570
for giving you a hard time.

114
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,350
When you told me you didn't want to see me, I realized

115
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,330
that this is my problem

116
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,520
and not yours.

117
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,240
What I want from you

118
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,620
isn't an apology

119
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,270
but a relationship.

120
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:55,870
Wonyoung,

121
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,010
should we

122
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,920
get back together?

123
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,390
Hey!

124
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,559
Where are you?

125
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,460
Are you on your way?

126
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,919
What about Wonyoung? You're coming together, right?

127
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,270
Hey are you not going to check your Kakaotalk?

128
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,080
Is something wrong with Wonyoung?

129
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,010
Where are you?

130
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,560
Hey!

131
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:47,600
Hey!

132
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,460
The time stopped in front of us,

133
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,860
there's only,

134
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,910
the two of us.

135
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:19,780
Look at that sunset, just for us...

136
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,710
Merry Christmas!

137
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,720
Hey,

138
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,530
are you crazy?

139
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,380
Drink yours!

140
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,130
Hey!

141
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,150
Stop stealing mine! Drink yours!

142
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,360
Let me at least do this.

143
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:03,240
Ah, I can't stand being alone with these two when I'm sober.

144
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,450
Geez.

145
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,000
You're a patient.

146
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,820
Your wife told me that she'll kill me too if you drink.

147
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,920
She's so meticulous.

148
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,770
My ideal type wasn't a meticulous woman though.

149
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,700
Then was your ideal type a clumsy woman?

150
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,350
No, a woman with some flaws.

151
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:22,820
What about you?

152
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,410
Me?

153
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,590
I like a sexy Hispanic.

154
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,370
Oh, a passionate Latin?

155
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,050
That's right, even the pronunciation of Spanish is sexy.

156
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,380
Just wait and see, I'm going to go somewhere like Spain where the sun shines brightly,

157
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,520
and live with a handsome Latin man.

158
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,740
Salud!

159
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:42,310
Oh?

160
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:42,960
Salud!

161
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,420
Do I need to learn Spanish?

162
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:15,780
We're here.

163
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,050
This

164
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,770
isn't a dream, right?

165
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,550
Of course not.

166
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,110
Should we go in after you're fully awake?

167
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:35,710
Yes.

168
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,970
You should go inside first.

169
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,340
Don't drink too much.

170
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,480
I thought you said to drink together.

171
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,810
What I meant was to drink together by ourselves.

172
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,540
Are you guys still fighting?

173
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,570
You sure came here quickly.

174
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,330
You're timing is terrible.

175
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,140
Why? What? What's wrong with my timing?

176
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,890
He's drunk and hopeless.

177
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,850
It must be hard on you.

178
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:30,720
Hello!

179
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,300
Wonyoung, you're here.

180
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,620
Wonyoung!

181
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,160
Oh?

182
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,350
Taejoon, you're here.

183
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,830
Oh! Wonyoung, you're here.

184
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,210
Yeah, I'm here.

185
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:43,460
What do you mean "yeah I'm here".

186
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,540
Hey, if you came late come and help me.

187
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,250
Wait a moment.

188
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:47,750
Okay.

189
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,420
Wait a moment?

190
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,410
What's with this mood?

191
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,130
Are you two back together?

192
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,360
It doesn't feel real yet though.

193
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,580
Finally!

194
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,850
I wanted to stop being a spy,

195
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,590
now I feel happy.

196
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,910
You guys sure came a long way.

197
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,680
What about you?

198
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,290
You're going around the world.

199
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,040
Go away!

200
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,720
Here, here, steak is here!

201
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,920
You're my husband's lifesaver, right?

202
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:24,600
Hello.

203
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,130
It's not to the point of being a lifesaver.

204
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,120
Please eat a lot.

205
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,110
I purposely saved the best part to give to you.

206
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,980
Thank you, I'll eat it well.

207
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:37,800
Oh?

208
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,820
Don't eat it if you don't want to.

209
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,060
It's burnt.

210
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:45,000
Yoon Taejoon, don't you know that people call this well-done?

211
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,210
It's good.

212
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,010
You too, sir.

213
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,350
Ah~

214
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,430
Oh?

215
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,640
Taejoon never eats burnt ones...

216
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,650
Hm~

217
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:07,830
it's good.

218
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:08,360
He eats it.

219
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,050
How can someone change like this?

220
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,260
Oh?

221
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,920
My dear wife.

222
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,510
How can you take off our wedding ring?

223
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,650
I was cooking so I took it off for a bit.

224
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,510
For a bit?

225
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,260
How can you say for a bit? Is this just any ring?

226
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,770
This is the proof of our love!

227
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,910
You have to wear it so that other's will know we're a married couple. -Stop right there!

228
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,320
I put it back on, okay?

229
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,970
Don't take it off~

230
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:33,980
Promise me.

231
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,370
Ring promise.

232
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,350
Stamp.

233
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,480
Let's eat, let's eat.

234
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,320
I should also be drinking on a day like this.

235
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,170
Then let's all together, salud!

236
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,200
Salud!

237
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,050
Team leader.

238
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,030
Oh?

239
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,780
Do we need to pay for something?

240
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,710
Yes, for the pottery class.

241
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,410
I got permission from Mr. Yoon.

242
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,100
Oh, really?

243
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,950
But vice-manager Jung changed the person in charge of this to assistant manager Seo.

244
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,930
Ah...

245
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,220
Anyways, I'm impressed Wonyoung.

246
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,800
How did you persuade him?

247
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:16,980
Team leader,

248
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:18,690
I'm sorry,

249
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,960
I'll be right back.

250
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:22,730
You should take this...

251
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,130
Did you hear about Ji Wonyoung?

252
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:27,790
What?

253
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,450
The person that took bribes with manager Kim was the assistant manager of the General Affairs Team.

254
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:31,930
Wow.

255
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,610
So he was wrongly accused?

256
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,210
Yeah, I heard that he came back to work right after manager Kim confessed.

257
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,110
Wow, he was so wronged.

258
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,340
Where did you hear this from?

259
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,140
Oh,

260
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,380
um...

261
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,710
Who did you hear it from?

262
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,340
A worker from the Personnel Team...

263
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,200
I'm sorry for what happened up till now.

264
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,570
Wonyoung,

265
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,270
aren't you coming here a bit too casually?

266
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,580
Are you sure

267
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,160
the reason I was able to get my job back

268
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,090
is because Mr. Yoon Taejoon signed the contract?

269
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,620
Why are you asking about that now?

270
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,940
Isn't it fine as long as you got your job back?

271
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,370
From the start, you never reported it, right?

272
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,390
You were just using me.

273
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,450
Wait so,

274
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:39,960
now,

275
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,560
you're asking me to deal with this matter with conscience?

276
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,350
It's not like this is some university club.

277
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,080
Now that I look at it,

278
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,830
it's always people like you

279
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,020
that like to blame problems on other people.

280
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,540
Huh?

281
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,920
Because you're so weak.

282
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,900
You don't even know how to think about whether or not you're the one that's wrong.

283
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:00,550
Huh?

284
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,050
Regarding the pottery class,

285
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,170
I got Mr. Yoon's permission.

286
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,290
I will be leading this.

287
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,950
I think I just saw you.

288
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,090
When will you come out from that bathroom?

289
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,290
I was afraid I'd bother you so I didn't contact you,

290
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,700
but you caught me.

291
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:06,680
I'll head out right away.

292
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,790
So you're an employee at Taepyeong.

293
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,790
Are you trying to get on Taejoon's good side so that you can get promoted?

294
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,050
Don't do that,

295
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,850
I already tried it before.

296
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,620
What do you want to say to me?

297
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,220
I don't know,

298
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,800
I'm just capricious.

299
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,020
As you can see, I'm working right now

300
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,530
so I don't have time to listen to you.

301
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,290
Don't you feel great because someone that seems perfect says they like you?

302
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,860
It's as if you're now as superior as them.

303
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:48,610
Well,

304
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,450
I know because I felt the same way.

305
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,160
You don't seem to know,

306
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,370
but I am Yoon Taejoon's only weakness.

307
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,080
Not you.

308
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,030
I feel like you're misunderstanding something.

309
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,780
I know I'm not Yoon Taejoon's weakness,

310
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,040
nor do I want to become one.

311
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,740
I guess becoming the other person's weakness

312
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,110
is your way of loving them.

313
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,370
Why do you try to become the weakness of someone you love and then control them with it?

314
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:25,960
Ah,

315
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,920
because if you don't do that,

316
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,160
you're not confident that they'll stay by you?

317
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,440
Normally,

318
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,130
people don't love like that.

319
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,760
This jerk.

320
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,070
Don't touch him.

321
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,370
Let's just leave.

322
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,600
I have a meeting to attend in 10 minutes.

323
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:11,980
Are you injured anywhere?

324
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,430
You saw everything already.

325
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,040
I'm sorry.

326
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,270
Why are you sorry?

327
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,590
I never thought

328
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,210
that he would come

329
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,780
and provoke you.

330
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,680
Knowing that he's around,

331
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,080
I should've been more careful.

332
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,830
Come on,

333
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,480
I provoked him more than he provoked me.

334
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,840
What are you doing?

335
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:43,590
Nothing.

336
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,510
This way, please.

337
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,000
This way, please.

338
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,940
Please call me after you've confirmed everything.

339
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:23,470
Okay.

340
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,220
That was him, right? Ji Wonyoung from the General Affairs Team.

341
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,890
It's impressive how he can still smile and work like that.

342
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,680
If I were him, I'd feel so wronged I wouldn't come.

343
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,350
Exactly.

344
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,530
He got his job back due to the confession,

345
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,720
but everyone's still talking about how he has connections.

346
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,460
I thought Mr. Yoon was the one who had his back.

347
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,530
Why don't you go into more detail?

348
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,080
Sir, did you wait long?

349
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,130
Why didn't you

350
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,120
quit your job?

351
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,010
What do you mean?

352
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,920
I heard everything from the Personnel Team.

353
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,040
Ah...

354
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,130
Why are you still working there

355
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,350
when they are talking about you

356
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:41,660
like that?

357
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:45,150
That's because I need to go to work in order to see you.

358
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,010
I'm sorry.

359
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:46,860
Sir,

360
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,440
you don't have to be sorry.

361
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:53,330
I simply wanted you to feel a bit guilty for what you did.

362
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,440
Had I known that this was how you were being treated,

363
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,260
I never would've agreed to vice-manager Jung's proposal.

364
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,930
Sir, look at me.

365
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,780
No matter

366
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,630
what other's say about me,

367
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,330
it has zero effect on me.

368
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,160
The only thing I am scared of right now

369
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,160
is you.

370
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,240
Ah...

371
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,810
so,

372
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,050
what am I supposed to do from here?

373
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,920
Now you just need to make your ID.

374
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,580
Only for

375
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,640
WY.

376
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,400
Only for WY?

377
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,140
Mine is

378
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,350
Only for TJ.

379
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,110
TJ?

380
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,220
Taejoon?

381
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,900
With this kind of thing,

382
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,770
the more childish it is, the more stylish it is.

383
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,730
Set it to private,

384
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:12,700
and we're done.

385
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:13,840
Here.

386
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,500
Yay.

387
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,380
Did you want to do this that badly?

388
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:21,390
Because this is both official yet secretive.

389
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,380
But,

390
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,770
don't you have anything you want to do with me?

391
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,290
Watching the sunset by the beach.

392
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:34,890
Sunset?

393
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,340
Because when I'm watching the sunset,

394
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,000
it feels like the time stops.

395
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:54,920
Ah,

396
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,650
I don't want to go to work.

397
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,320
I just want to

398
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,200
keep hugging you like this.

399
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,430
If you don't want to then just quit.

400
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,880
Come on, I can't do that.

401
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,630
I have to live while doing the things I don't like, too.

402
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,970
I can't just only do the things I like.

403
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:09,060
Although you can't live while only doing the things you like,

404
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,120
but I'll let you

405
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,120
do everything you want to do.

406
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,370
Am I being materialistic?

407
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,840
I'm happy just from hearing this.

408
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,590
Since I have a rich boyfriend now,

409
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,450
I guess I'll take advantage of it.

410
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:23,850
Yes,

411
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:25,740
good choice.

412
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,440
I'm just kidding.

413
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,520
I'm being serious.

414
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,470
I hope you will use me as much as possible.

415
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,820
I'm prepared to be used by you.

416
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,260
But I'm not going to use you.

417
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:35,730
Goodness,

418
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,740
what a waste.

419
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,670
I'm going to love you instead.

420
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,310
I just

421
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:48,760
want to love you.

422
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,490
Why didn't you pick up the phone?

423
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,010
So you've finally come to your senses!

424
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:30,630
Scorching

425
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,540
passion.

426
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:34,910
What's wrong with you?

427
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:35,840
Well,

428
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,990
you said that histrange or whatever

429
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,750
uses Spanish.

430
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,710
You've really gone crazy.

431
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:46,990
Right?

432
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,110
Spanish?

433
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,880
Seriously, Spanish?

434
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,980
Gosh,

435
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:55,350
I thought you were preparing for your GED.

436
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,290
Wait, wait, wait.

437
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,270
Love,

438
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:11,230
will you go out with me?

439
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,740
Are you seriously not going to leave?

440
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,320
Oh?

441
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,200
You understood.

442
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,010
Very good.

443
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:22,970
Nevermind.

444
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,370
Why...

445
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,380
why aren't you hitting me?

446
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,250
Hey!

447
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,340
Stop stealing mine!

448
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,990
Drink yours!

449
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,070
Let me at least do this.

450
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:58,930
Let me

451
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,780
at least do this.

452
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,020
Pulling an all-nighter today, too.

453
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,330
Not me, but that old man.

454
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,270
Ah, I'm jealous of that old man.

455
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,450
I want to see you, too.

456
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,240
What do you need?

457
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,340
Wonyoung,

458
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,040
could you come and talk with me for a moment?

459
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:48,950
It'll only take a moment.

460
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,020
A moment.

461
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,170
I'm busy.

462
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,020
Wonyoung,

463
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,540
something bad happened.

464
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,380
Mr. Yoon

465
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,360
just told us that he's going to terminate the contract.

466
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:11,560
What do you mean?

467
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,060
The contract fee is hundreds of millions

468
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,410
and the penalty fee is three times that amount.

469
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:18,140
Yet he says it doesn't matter and that he'll pay for it!

470
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,050
Seriously.

471
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,640
But I heard from the chairman that he's terminating it because of me.

472
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,360
Do you know anything about this?

473
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,990
Had I known that this was how you were being treated,

474
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,050
I never would've agreed

475
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,040
to vice-manager Jung's proposal.

476
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:34,930
I hope you will

477
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,580
use me as much as possible.

478
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,930
I'm prepared

479
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,480
to be used by you.

480
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:44,830
Ah...

481
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,000
Taejoon.

482
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,250
Since you are close to Mr. Yoon,

483
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:51,260
could you help me look into it?

484
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,120
To be honest, I even went to Gangneung for three days to ask him to meet me,

485
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,960
but it didn't work.

486
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,690
Seriously,

487
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,580
I'm on the verge of dying right now.

488
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,230
Should I

489
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,670
look into it for you?

490
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:07,760
Really?

491
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,400
Can you really do that?

492
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,520
Please, Wonyoung. Save me.

493
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,960
I'm not doing this to save you.

494
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,960
This time, when I bring Mr. Yoon,

495
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,710
I'm the one who brought him here

496
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,310
and not you.

497
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:25,430
What?

498
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,400
I'm giving you the chance to do the right thing.

499
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,000
Let the chairman know properly this time,

500
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,290
that I was the one

501
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,240
who got Mr. Yoon to sign the contract in the first place.

502
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:34,880
That...

503
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,540
that's a bit...

504
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,350
But before that,

505
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,200
apologize to me.

506
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,330
Sincerely.

507
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,020
What?

508
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:48,370
What are you trying to do?

509
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:51,010
I already know that you two broke up.

510
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,570
Then just quit.

511
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,390
What happens to you doesn't concern me.

512
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:00,220
I'm sorry.

513
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:09,710
I'm sorry,

514
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,560
Ji Wonyoung.

515
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,290
But,

516
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,660
don't you have anything you want to do with me?

517
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:56,620
Watching the sunset by the beach.

518
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:57,340
Sunset?

519
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:01,950
Because when I'm watching the sunset, it feels like the time stops.

520
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:20,370
Do you want to watch it together?

521
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,800
I found you.

522
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:33,910
Thank you.

523
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:34,940
For what?

524
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:35,960
For everything.

525
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,680
I'm getting a bit tired of hearing this.

526
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,600
Then you should use some of your creativity.

527
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,550
It really feels like the time has stopped.

528
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,030
You're right.

529
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:49,230
(Thank you to all the viewers who have loved Unintentional Love Story so far)
