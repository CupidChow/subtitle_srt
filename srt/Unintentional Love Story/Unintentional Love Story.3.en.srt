11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,620
Vice-manager Jung.

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,810
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,200
Mr. Yoon was next to me earlier.

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,640
Hm, I see.

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,840
Is there any progress so far?

16
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:49,880
Um...

17
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,910
we seem to have gotten closer.

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,510
I've been to his house once

19
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,520
and we even drank alcohol together.

20
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:56,450
Oh, that's good.

21
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,320
Then what about his plans on returning to work?

22
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,080
Did you find out about anything special?

23
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,210
I haven't gotten that far.

24
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,269
Well, gaining Mr. Yoon's trust is the priority

25
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,160
so I'm guessing you need more time.

26
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,430
Anyways,

27
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,620
you have to make Mr. Yoon open his heart completely to you.

28
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,020
Understand?

29
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:15,520
Yes.

30
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,289
So,

31
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,330
I'll really get reinstated, right?

32
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:31,530
Hello?

33
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:32,920
Hello?

34
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,240
Wonyoung.

35
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,390
Ah, it's because this isn't working.

36
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,910
Why are you trying so hard?

37
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,670
It's not like you can become a ceramist by starting now.

38
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:55,940
It's just that...

39
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,509
because I already started.

40
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,750
I'm also doing this because I want to.

41
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,600
Take some clay at the end of the next class.

42
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,860
Rather than using this clay, practicing

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,140
with white porcelain will help a lot more.

44
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:16,780
Okay!

45
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,079
Thank you!

46
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:31,920
Your first piece of work.

47
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,310
Wow!

48
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,260
I baked it while fixing the kiln.

49
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,190
This is so cool.

50
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,880
Is this really the color I made?

51
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,850
I told you last time,

52
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:59,930
depending on the type of kiln,

53
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,420
the color changes.

54
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,120
That one

55
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,540
is baked by a manual kiln.

56
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:07,890
So cool...

57
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,490
Can I also join you next time?

58
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,170
To the kiln?

59
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,230
Ah,

60
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,180
I went overboard.

61
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,829
Nevermind, I was just fascinated by it.

62
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,690
As... long as there's time.

63
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,430
You said so!

64
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,710
No changing minds later on!

65
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,420
At the end of the year, I'm having an exhibition at the cultural center.

66
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,360
Wonyoung,

67
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,950
you should also try submitting your work.

68
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,170
Okay.

69
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,400
What?

70
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:42,920
Me?

71
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,370
Hm... did I gain some of his trust?

72
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,459
Wonyoung, wait a minute.

73
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,260
Hello.

74
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,540
The thing is,

75
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,620
there's some bad news I have to tell you...

76
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,030
We're doing some indoor renovations suddenly

77
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,250
so I won't be able to extend your stay.

78
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,430
Even if I do, I can only extend it for three days.

79
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,350
Ah...

80
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:49,950
Do I need to ask vice-manager Jung for a place to stay...

81
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,610
Okay~

82
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,110
Four cups today as well?

83
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,580
Okay~ I'll deliver it right away!

84
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,970
Wonyoung, I just saw your message.

85
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,320
About the activity fee, it's hard for me to give you an answer right now.

86
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,480
I'll look into it first and call you tomorrow.

87
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:02,620
Sir!

88
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,730
What are you doing here?

89
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,030
Students are bringing their works today, right?

90
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,260
I noticed last time that there's a lot of things,

91
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,460
so I came to help you.

92
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,090
You should head home today.

93
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,590
Ah...

94
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,760
I'm okay... I had a slight fever last night

95
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,560
but after taking medicine and getting some sleep, I'm completely fine now.

96
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,040
I don't need help from someone

97
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,630
who can't take care of their own body.

98
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,300
There's a lot of people here, so others might get infected, too.

99
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,690
Don't come into class today.

100
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,430
You're right.

101
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,120
I might pass the virus onto others if I stay.

102
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,740
I'll rest today.

103
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,360
It's not a cold.

104
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:00,780
Right?

105
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,570
It's herpes zoster.

106
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,360
What?

107
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,400
This must hurt a lot.

108
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,370
You're making it worse by enduring the pain.

109
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,420
When you feel like something's wrong with your body, you should come to the hospital and take your medicine properly.

110
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,190
Okay...

111
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,270
They said it's not contagious,

112
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,660
but I'm still worried about going to the cafe.

113
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,930
Oh my... you should worry about yourself.

114
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,570
Take a good rest during this period.

115
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:27,590
Okay.

116
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,690
I'll contact you once I'm better.

117
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:44,490
Where are you going?

118
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,950
Oh, what are you doing here, sir?

119
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,510
Does Donghee make you do deliveries all the way till here?

120
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,590
I'm not here to work. I had some things to do here.

121
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,460
I'll be leaving now, sir you should go, too.

122
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,210
Ugh...

123
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,010
why did I run into him here.

124
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,190
Sir, you can just go.

125
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,310
What about the hospital?

126
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,900
I'm on my way back from it.

127
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,250
What did they say?

128
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,570
They said it's not a cold, it's herpes zoster...

129
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,650
Thanks to you, I got it treated before it got worse.

130
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,730
Thank you.

131
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,340
I will go now.

132
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,060
Get in.

133
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,630
I'll drop you off.

134
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,130
No, it's okay. I need to go look at houses near here.

135
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,030
Houses?

136
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,130
Yes... because something came up.

137
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,700
You're not feeling well,

138
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,900
do you have to go look at it right now?

139
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,540
I don't think I need to explain the reason to you.

140
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,580
We can talk in the car.

141
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,780
I'm really okay.

142
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,160
Ji Wonyoung,

143
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,540
let's just go.

144
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,390
You can look for houses after you get better.

145
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,910
I want to do that too

146
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,210
but I don't have a place to stay right now.

147
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,190
The pension I've been staying at is going under construction.

148
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,280
I have to leave within three days.

149
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,040
Tell me the name.

150
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,060
What?

151
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,790
Your name sir?

152
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:57,580
The pension.

153
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,150
Ah... you don't need to drop me off.

154
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,830
I've been looking around and found some decent places.

155
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,380
I want to look around on my way back.

156
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,800
You can move later.

157
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,430
While you're healing you can stay at my house.

158
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:12,980
What?

159
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,740
Me?

160
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,120
At your house?

161
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,410
You should pack your bags first.

162
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,780
Give me the pension's address.

163
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,390
♫ You can't stop ♫

164
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,260
♫ Don't stop don't stop keep going♫

165
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,350
♫ The moment that came ♫

166
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:32,630
♫ Like a wave, I flow for you ♫

167
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:33,460
Wow...

168
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,590
I'm really at Yoon Taejoon's house!

169
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,860
This isn't a dream, right?

170
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:41,980
♫ You smile beautifully (I fall in love) ♫

171
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,180
♫ This is like a traffic, exit out ♫

172
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,830
♫ You are my traffic, exit out ♫

173
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,550
Ah, I can do it.
♫ You are my traffic, exit out ♫

174
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,240
♫ You are my traffic, exit out ♫

175
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,940
♫ The look in your eyes makes my heart beat ♫

176
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:58,220
♫ Your smile makes my heart melt ♫

177
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,310
♫ (I promise you) If you wanna be mine ♫

178
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,390
♫ (You promise me) If I wanna be yours ♫

179
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:06,700
♫ (We promise us) Our own traffic, exit out ♫

180
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,640
Since you've already stayed here once before,

181
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,150
you won't feel uncomfortable.

182
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:29,770
Get some rest.

183
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,640
Thank you.

184
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,340
Ah~ so comfortable...

185
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,240
Wait, but

186
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,890
why is he treating me so well?

187
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,380
I guess

188
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,360
he's just an incredibly kind person.

189
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,700
He just can't ignore those in need...

190
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:40,690
It's true...

191
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,000
my life looks like a mess to me, too.

192
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:51,960
Sir!

193
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,520
How are you feeling?

194
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,330
It seems like you slept well.

195
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,910
I thought I was okay

196
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,260
but I guess I was just enduring it.

197
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,890
Now that my body's comfortable, I am sore here and there.

198
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,000
You should rest for now.

199
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,240
If you're bored, feel free to read the books in the library.

200
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,100
Or you can watch a movie.

201
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,130
Thank you.

202
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,520
But...

203
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,410
sir, can you apply the medicine for me?

204
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,600
Because

205
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,090
the wound is on the center of my back

206
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,690
so it's a bit hard for me.

207
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,180
Ah...

208
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,320
sure.

209
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,440
There's a spot that's red, right?

210
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,460
It's there.

211
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:54,390
Sir?

212
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,490
Ah, yes.

213
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,740
You did it on purpose, right?

214
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,640
No.

215
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,810
Ouch!

216
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:57,670
Hello?

217
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,850
Three cups of iced americano?

218
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,250
Okay~

219
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,270
Coffee.

220
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,310
There.

221
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,319
Where?

222
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:16,520
On that table~ add some syrup and you can drink it.

223
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,530
How can you give me the one that's not freshly made?

224
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,400
Ah, I made it just now, okay?

225
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,609
Try to be understanding for the time being.

226
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,730
Wonyoung is sick so I told him to rest for a few days.

227
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:30,590
I know.

228
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,430
You know?

229
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,510
You're the weird one for not noticing.

230
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,910
You didn't even notice he's sick and made him work which is why it's such a mess now.

231
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:43,360
Hey! How was I supposed to notice? Am I some kind of doctor?

232
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,350
Ugh!

233
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,690
Hey~ your straw! Straw!

234
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,250
Hey! Kim Donghee!

235
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,250
What is this... why are there so many?

236
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,000
Ah, okay. Three cups of iced americano?

237
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,510
Okay, I'm heading over now!

238
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,470
What?

239
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,160
I'm so busy I don't have time to deal with you.

240
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,510
Wait but

241
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,420
did the part-timer not come?

242
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,190
Wonyoung is sick so he can't come to work for a while.

243
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,370
Then what about your deliveries?

244
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:58,470
What about it?

245
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,320
Should I help..?

246
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,660
Yeah, it's such a sudden progress, right?

247
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,560
I also didn't know I was going to end up at his house.

248
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,950
I got the activity fee,

249
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:21,460
thank you.

250
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,170
I'll send the report with the edits.

251
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:26,800
Okay~

252
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,220
There's nothing here...

253
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,900
I was happy that I got to come into his house,

254
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,220
but there needs to be at least something for me to find a clue.

255
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,520
Ugh... am I allowed to do this?

256
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,310
Wow Ji Wonyoung, this is really wrong.

257
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,680
There's really nothing.

258
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,250
He's such an incredible person...

259
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,310
Oh god... why is it so dusty in here.

260
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,420
If I clean it up for him,

261
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,480
we'll become closer, right?

262
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:50,970
Did someone tell you to clean?

263
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,860
Ah... it's not like that

264
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,710
I just noticed that it's dusty in here.

265
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,100
I'll be done after putting this back.

266
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,200
Leave it!

267
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,120
It's fine,

268
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:16,930
so just leave.

269
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,520
♫ In my dream ♫

271
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:53,170
♫ You wake me up ♫

272
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,780
♫ Inside the moments ♫

273
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:03,990
♫ That we can't hold onto ♫

274
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,390
♫ We wake up in the dream ♫

275
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,520
♫ Inside this forever ♫

276
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:19,610
♫ That cannot be erased ♫

277
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,210
Ugh... why did I go in there without permission...

278
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,740
It's ruined, it's ruined!

279
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,530
What should I do now..?

280
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,710
♫ You wake me up ♫

281
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:55,280
♫ Inside the moments ♫

282
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:03,180
♫ That we can't hold onto ♫

283
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,350
Should I have not brought him here...

284
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,830
Did... you sleep well?

285
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,090
Your body...

286
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:43,840
Are you feeling okay?

287
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:45,610
Yes.

288
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,560
Yesterday... -Yesterday...

289
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:54,120
I'm sorry about yesterday.

290
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:57,040
I shouldn't have gone into the workshop without permission.

291
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,500
You are allowed to go in.

292
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,030
The workshop,

293
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,490
feel free to use it.

294
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,080
Your phone.

295
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,570
Call me if anything happens.

296
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:54,460
What..?

297
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,260
Did I just exchange numbers with Yoon Taejoon?

298
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,020
The pottery you ordered has arrived.

299
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,450
Thank you.

300
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,300
Come again next time.

301
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:08,970
Okay.

302
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:09,960
Thank you.

303
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,700
Goodbye.

304
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,650
Ah,

305
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,580
I wasn't trying to bother you.

306
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,070
Then you shouldn't have texted me, right?

307
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,800
Ah...

308
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,380
It's a joke.

309
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,580
Who tells a joke in such a tense manner...

310
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:53,550
Ah,

311
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,590
if I'm going to submit a work for the exhibition, I thought I should practice more.

312
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,420
About yesterday,

313
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,270
I'm sorry.

314
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:05,680
What?

315
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,800
For recklessly letting out my anger.

316
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,390
No, it's okay! I was also in the wrong.

317
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:15,080
When will you be coming back?

318
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,800
Ah, no!

319
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:24,050
It's just that being here alone

320
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,450
feels 50 thousand times more awkward..?

321
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,020
Something like that..?

322
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:30,640
Around 8 P.M.

323
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,400
I'll go back right after closing the shop.

324
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:34,380
Okay,

325
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:35,890
then.

326
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,110
It seems like the blisters have spread.

327
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,490
Cha Jooheon!

328
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,570
Here.

329
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,050
It's already been two years since you came here,

330
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,980
yet you're still making me run errands for you.

331
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:08,920
Did I tell you to?

332
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,710
Then what should I do?

333
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,810
Everyone's scared of you so they come to me.

334
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,700
I feel like I'm going to end up attending meetings for you, too.

335
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,410
Ugh so annoying.

336
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:25,960
I thought you're busy?

337
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,560
That's what I'm saying.

338
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,870
Should I

339
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:36,620
just ignore everyone and live like you?

340
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,020
With that personality of yours?

341
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,940
I can't, right?

342
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,990
I should just live according to how I look.

343
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,240
But...

344
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,990
why did the picky Cha Jooheon

345
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,140
suddenly become Mother Theresa?

346
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:57,760
What are you talking about?

347
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,250
What did you say last time to those who applied late for pottery class?

348
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,600
"Rules are there to be kept".

349
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,900
You said that and then kicked them out.

350
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,250
What are you trying to say?

351
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,650
So what I'm saying is...

352
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,380
that rule,

353
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,490
why is Wonyoung the only exception?

354
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,830
Are you not going to put that back?

355
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,310
It wasn't intentional,

356
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,790
but I'm the reason why he's here.

357
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,190
So whether it's pottery class or something else,

358
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,050
I hope he can get what he wants and go back to where he came from.

359
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:02,150
Is that really the only reason?

360
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:04,930
What other reason do I need?

361
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,810
No it's just~

362
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,000
It's just,

363
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,990
a sense of responsibility,

364
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:17,670
something like that.

365
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,210
Okay, I got it.

366
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,310
I'm leaving!

367
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,120
You're back!

368
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:47,630
Textbook.

369
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,210
Thank you!

370
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,500
Sir,

371
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,930
this is a palette knife, right?

372
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,640
Today,

373
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,970
we will learn how to coil first.

374
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:18,960
Okay.

375
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,170
Try to balance out your strength as much as possible.

376
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,230
Imagine that you are

377
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,390
stretching the clay with your knuckles.

378
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,840
Oh? Why isn't this...

379
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,940
The clay we're using today is softer,

380
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,480
so be careful when controlling your strength.

381
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:46,740
Okay.

382
00:32:58,770 --> 00:32:59,610
Try it while

383
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,710
patting it with a sponge.

384
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,000
Okay.

385
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,070
I'll change it for you.

386
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,290
Thank you.

387
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,370
Sir! I did it!

388
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,310
Oh, this...

389
00:33:59,130 --> 00:33:59,310
♫ My heart got stolen without me realizing it ♫

390
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,120
