Assistant manager Park.

12
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,049
How's the company's first internal general electives lecture going?

13
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,570
Well, there haven't been any major changes.

14
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,390
But Wonyoung

15
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,570
has something he wants to add.

16
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:45,970
Yes.

17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,210
I was thinking about adding pottery class to the general electives.

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,220
It just so happens that our gallery

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,320
is holding Mr. Yoon's pottery exhibition.

20
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,650
Oh, our chairman's favorite ceramist?

21
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,690
I think he's really famous.

22
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,950
I went over the weekend and there were a lot of people.

23
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:12,039
But will such a famous person accept our invitation?

24
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,770
Even though he signed a contract with us,

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,720
I think it'll be difficult to ask him to teach us.

26
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,030
I've already talked about it with the gallery.

27
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,170
Since this will help promote Mr. Yoon, they are very supportive of it.

28
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,810
I also heard that the chairman wishes for Mr. Yoon

29
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,260
to engage a lot with the company.

30
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,100
That's good.

31
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:33,210
Then Wonyoung you're in charge of making this work.

32
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:34,160
Okay, team manager.

33
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,340
(Part 9)

34
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,330
Wow.

35
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,130
This is exactly my type.

36
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,310
I'm taking it.

37
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,210
Put it down.

38
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,070
You donate your works every year, can't you just give me one?

39
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,620
Go back.

40
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,050
I want to be alone.

41
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,240
Wow.

42
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,800
This one's amazing, too.

43
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:11,550
I didn't know when you were just an owner of a plate shop,

44
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,690
but now that I know you're a famous artist

45
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,460
the plates have started to shine.

46
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,530
Are you not going to put it down?

47
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:18,400
Okay.

48
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,670
Have you not heard anything from Wonyoung lately?

49
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,180
I mean,

50
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,540
he used to contact me everyday.

51
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,160
Although all he talked about was you.

52
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,590
But it's already been ten days since I last heard from him.

53
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,950
Hm... is it because he's busy?

54
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,300
Or,

55
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,520
is he starting to give up?

56
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,960
Didn't I tell you that we've broken up?

57
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,130
If you keep this up,

58
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,180
Wonyoung will really give up one day.

59
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,790
Ah! I'll go.

60
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,960
I'm going, I'm going.

61
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,200
Hey!

62
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:25,540
Jeez.

63
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,220
I am trying to understand why you are looking at me with lingering feelings,

64
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,350
and whether if

65
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,570
you still have things

66
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,800
that you need to use me for.

67
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,260
Hello.

68
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:11,910
Hello?

69
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,180
Hello Mr. Yoon, I'm vice-manager Jung from Taepyeong.

70
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,519
Are you available to talk right now?

71
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,620
Yes, go ahead.

72
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:23,360
I just sent you an email with the project proposal for the pottery class I told you about last time.

73
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,270
Please take a look at it and respond to us.

74
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:27,400
Okay.

75
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,030
Oh and,

76
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,470
though you'll find out after reading the project proposal,

77
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,840
but the person in charge of this

78
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,420
is Ji Wonyoung.

79
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,909
I thought it'd be better to let you know in advance.

80
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,670
Then I guess I won't need to think about it much.

81
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,890
I would like to refuse.

82
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:45,880
Pardon?

83
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:46,980
Mr. Yoon?

84
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,230
Hello?

85
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,430
Mr. Yoon?

86
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,100
See, he's saying he won't do it.

87
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,650
That's why I said we should leave your name out of the project proposal, why did you have to be so stubborn?

88
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,390
I'll try to convince him.

89
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,270
I can do it.

90
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,960
Wow, seriously.

91
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,320
I can't give up on you!

92
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,740
This is driving me crazy.

93
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:51,830
Hello.

94
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,240
Are you here to look for Taejoon?

95
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,080
Yes.

96
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,570
Are you sure he knows?

97
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:57,600
He didn't mention anything.

98
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,590
He's not accepting my calls so I came without telling him.

99
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,690
I'm not sure if he'll be willing to meet you,

100
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,500
but he's inside.

101
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,170
Thank you.

102
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,070
Did you,

103
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,750
do something wrong to him?

104
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,400
Yes.

105
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,090
A lot.

106
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:18,860
Oh my...

107
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,350
then just give up.

108
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,370
I don't think he'll change his mind.

109
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,260
If only the wound he received from Inho was cured...

110
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:28,460
What?

111
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,120
Oh no!

112
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,390
Senior!

113
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,370
Ji Wonyoung?

114
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,280
Are you hurt?

115
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,090
Don't worry.

116
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,750
He wasn't struck by the logs.

117
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,080
He suddenly fainted so I caught him but...

118
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,920
I'm asking if you're okay!

119
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,950
I'm okay.

120
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,960
We should hurry and take him to the hospital.

121
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,060
Senior!

122
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,290
Senior!

123
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,320
Please let me know if you have any inconveniences.

124
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,170
Okay.

125
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,050
I can't believe it's orthostatic hypotension. This is so embarrassing.

126
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,900
I told you to stop drinking so much.

127
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,820
Stop.

128
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,760
I already heard enough from the doctor.

129
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:47,870
Gosh.

130
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,960
Thank you.

131
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,860
Things would've been worse if you weren't there.

132
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,130
I'm glad that you are okay.

133
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,480
But what will we do now.

134
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,490
Your works are due the day after tomorrow, right?

135
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,890
They need to go into the kiln by tonight in order to make it on schedule.

136
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,760
Don't worry about it,

137
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,600
just focus on your treatment.

138
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,240
I'll figure it out myself.

139
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,500
Hey, you won't be able to finish it on your own.

140
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,210
Um...

141
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,200
Can I help?

142
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,670
It's Sunday tomorrow and I don't have plans.

143
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,460
You're going to do it?

144
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,310
Are you sure?

145
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,350
If it helps, yes.

146
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,820
You should get treated first.

147
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,120
But I'm fine.

148
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:32,850
Follow me.

149
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,049
Ouch...

150
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,950
I didn't need to put on a band-aid.

151
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,990
Thank you,

152
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,520
for protecting senior Geonhee.

153
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,210
No problem.

154
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,030
Anyone would've done so.

155
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,320
Did you come here today

156
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,260
because of the project proposal?

157
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:00,890
Ah...

158
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,400
that's true but

159
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,670
isn't the problem at the workshop more urgent right now?

160
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,390
It's fine.

161
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,740
If I really can't do it myself, I'll look for someone to help.

162
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,430
I

163
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,590
didn't offer to help because of the project proposal.

164
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,580
Yes, professor.

165
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,640
Ah,

166
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,780
no,

167
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,460
I will give it to you on time.

168
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,130
By tomorrow night.

169
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,810
I really

170
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,550
didn't want to ask you this kind of favor,

171
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,330
but I'm in an awkward situation right now

172
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,360
so can you help me?

173
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,990
Of course! As much as possible!

174
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:05,860
Let's go.

175
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,570
This is what you'll be helping me with.

176
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,630
These are the works from the pottery class

177
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,400
and they need to be finished by Monday.

178
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,940
The ones on this side need to go into the kiln,

179
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,140
and for the ones on that side, I need you to help me package them.

180
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,970
You planned on doing all this by yourself?

181
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,520
What if you get sick from exhaustion?

182
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,010
I'm sorry.

183
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,110
I know I don't have the right to be worried.

184
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,100
Change into this.

185
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,530
Um...

186
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,470
I'll be there by the kiln,

187
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,400
so if you need anything just call me.

188
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,510
Don't worry about it.

189
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,340
I'm done.

190
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,360
Ah, good work.

191
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,580
You can go and rest now.

192
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,850
If there's work left to do, I'll do it.

193
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:30,550
It's fine,

194
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,630
just go over there and rest.

195
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,130
But I'm fine.

196
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,680
If sparks fly again,

197
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,060
I can help you block it.

198
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,500
This must have hurt.

199
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,570
No matter how you got it,

200
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,410
a wound is a wound.

201
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,730
I have some time,

202
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,220
why don't we go through the project proposal?

203
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,390
What project proposal?

204
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,510
The pottery class that's being held at the company.

205
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,440
Didn't you come here

206
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,430
because of that?

207
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,440
What's wrong?

208
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,180
What?

209
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,120
You're mad right now.

210
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,400
Do I even have the right to be mad?

211
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,700
But honestly, I feel wronged.

212
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,430
I didn't help you because of that.

213
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,500
But I guess you won't believe me no matter how many times I say it because you don't trust anything I say.

214
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,110
It's because I'm thankful.

215
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,590
I feel like you'll actually get mad if I gave you money instead.

216
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,970
Isn't that project proposal

217
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,560
what you need the most right now?

218
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,410
No, what I need the most right now isn't that.

219
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,820
You don't even know why I started that proposal.

220
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,080
Don't worry about it.

221
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,560
I didn't help you for the sake of getting something in return.

222
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,560
I'll sleep for a bit.

223
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,290
Wake me up if you need me for anything.

224
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,310
Unrequited love sucks.

225
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,190
It really does make people miserable.

226
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,410
I

227
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,870
really hate you

228
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,740
but I also really like you.

229
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,450
So much, it drives me crazy.

230
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,810
Was it around here?

231
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,540
No!

232
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,250
Why are people becoming more childish?

233
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,070
Oh?

234
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,280
I also like childish things.

235
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,010
Hello?

236
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,110
Wonyoung,

237
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,060
I'm Park Geonhee, Taejoon's senior.

238
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:17,410
Ah,

239
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:18,730
hello.

240
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,570
I got your number

241
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,820
from Heedong, I hope it's not rude of me.

242
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,360
Of course not.

243
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,130
Are you feeling better?

244
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,950
Yes, thanks to you.

245
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,770
I called you because of that.

246
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,090
Are you free the day after tomorrow on Christmas Eve?

247
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,470
Christmas Eve?

248
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,790
My wife is so grateful to you that she wants to treat you to a meal.

249
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,800
Everyone else is free on that day,

250
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,560
so I was thinking about throwing a small party.

251
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,060
Heedong and Hotae are coming, too.

252
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,660
Then,

253
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,670
is he going, too?

254
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,140
Ah, Taejoon?

255
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,200
He says he has something important to do on that day,

256
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,600
so he's coming right after he's done.

257
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,420
Though it'll probably be past midnight by then.

258
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,190
Then I'll go.

259
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:56,850
Okay,

260
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,940
then I'll text you after the place is decided.

261
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,570
Okay, thank you.

262
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,020
Are you sure I don't need to go and help tomorrow?

263
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,930
Don't worry,

264
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,610
Wonyoung already finished it for you.

265
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:23,540
Really?

266
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,120
I'm so thankful I don't know what to do.

267
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:28,650
So,

268
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,750
how's it going with Wonyoung?

269
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,320
What do you mean?

270
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,690
I told you we broke up.

271
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,320
Hey,

272
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,440
did you think I was completely unconscious when I fainted?

273
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,920
This,

274
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,530
I was listening, okay?

275
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,600
I've known you for so long yet you still worried about him first when I fainted.

276
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,330
He said he did something really wrong to you,

277
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,180
is it something unforgivable?

278
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:52,900
He

279
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,590
tricked me.

280
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,330
Turns out there was something that he wanted from me.

281
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,280
So he approached me intentionally

282
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,800
and pretended to love me.

283
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,690
Did Wonyoung say that?

284
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,780
That he pretended to love you?

285
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,250
Of course he denied it.

286
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,610
Who would admit to that.

287
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,590
My wife once told me that

288
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:22,120
every time I get into trouble she would hope for someone to take me away.

289
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,970
But once she thinks about

290
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,540
life without me,

291
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,580
her heart sinks and she ends up forgiving me.

292
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,130
What are you talking about suddenly?

293
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,740
Are you sure you can live without him?

294
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:33,980
From what I saw yesterday,

295
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,600
it didn't seem like you can.

296
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:38,980
Stop it.

297
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,390
You know that I'm always on your side, right?

298
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,840
I never said this during the past two years,

299
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,770
so I'll just say it once today.

300
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:47,930
Taejoon,

301
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,940
let go of the past.

302
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,460
If you miss out on something because of the past,

303
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,550
isn't that unfair for you?

304
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:02,460
Well,

305
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,030
I'm sure you'll figure it out yourself.

306
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,190
I'm sorry, sir.

307
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,080
I didn't know I was going to fall for you.

308
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,410
I did that because I didn't know.

309
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,080
I

310
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,690
really hate you

311
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:34,660
but I also really like you.

312
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,530
So much it drives me crazy

313
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,980
Shouldn't you go visit your family?

314
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,700
It's not like they'll be happy to see me.

315
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,090
I gave them a call though.

316
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,010
That's good.

317
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,800
You're going to choke, drink some water.

318
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,330
Did your father hit you again?

319
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,040
To me, it doesn't matter

320
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,540
whether you like men or women.

321
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,930
Auntie will always be rooting for your happiness till the day I die,

322
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,160
so if they kick you out, you can always come here.

323
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:14,750
Auntie...

324
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,180
Donghee.

325
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:29,930
Yes?

326
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:31,730
Eat well,

327
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,170
I'll leave now.

328
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,070
Go back inside.

329
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,620
Auntie.

330
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,000
I'm sorry.

331
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,280
Hey, wait for me!

332
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:20,210
You remember that we're closing early today to go look at coffee beans together, right?

333
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,150
What are you doing?

334
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:40,990
Hey,

335
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,780
you...

336
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,630
What? Why? Are you going to ask me out?

337
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,870
How can you hit me on the chest like that? -You're asking for it, aren't you?

338
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,180
But, how's the leg you injured?

339
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,390
It hurts!

340
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,860
Like, once a year?

341
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,850
I felt like I shouldn't ask so I never did,

342
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,100
but why did you ride the motorcyle?

343
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:24,920
Even when you fought, you were always careful to not get injured because you needed to swim.

344
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,440
Because I wanted to look more like a gangster.

345
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,390
After you went to Seoul for university,

346
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,220
I had a hard time.

347
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,250
I thought I'd be fine if I didn't see you around,

348
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,320
but I wasn't fine.

349
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,990
I thought I was crazy.

350
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,130
I couldn't believe the thoughts I was having

351
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,380
for a brother I'm close to.

352
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,460
I thought that if I lived like a mess,

353
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:00,760
then even if in the future I feel the need to confess to you,

354
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,800
I'd be too embarrassed to do so.

355
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,640
But that's all bullshit.

356
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,730
Because if you can't withstand something,

357
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:08,050
then you just can't withstand it.

358
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:15,810
Why

359
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,870
aren't you telling me to leave like usual? You're scaring me.

360
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:25,040
If you don't want to, you can just keep rejecting me.

361
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,850
I'll just continue to cling onto you until the day I die.

362
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,070
I should go wash this.

363
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,310
I'm from the General Affairs Team, could you give me the garage keys?

364
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,520
Yes, one moment please.

365
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,160
Could you bring the garage key?

366
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,750
Okay.

367
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:09,410
The person who has the key has gone outside,

368
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,860
so they are asking you to wait for ten minutes.

369
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,760
Then I'll wait here.

370
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,370
Okay.

371
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,310
Taejoon!

372
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:32,160
Oh?

373
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,300
Let's hurry, we're late.

374
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,980
Wow, there are so many swear words in this proposal.

375
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:31,620
What?

376
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:34,640
Ah...

377
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:36,610
Are you okay?

378
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,850
Yes, I'm okay.

379
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,520
Today's Christmas Eve, are you not going anywhere?

380
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,580
Oh right,

381
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:42,970
aren't you taking half the day off?

382
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,030
Yes, I did.

383
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,830
But I felt bad thinking that you'll be

384
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,550
checking the expendables by yourself.

385
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,100
So let's do it together.

386
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,460
What? Don't you have plans?

387
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,350
It got cancelled.

388
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,170
Yoon Taejoon!

389
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,180
Wait for me!

390
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:23,570
Yes?

391
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,390
Did something happen between you and Wonyoung?

392
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,130
What do you mean?

393
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,370
Wonyoung told me he won't be able to come today.

394
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,070
Suddenly? Why?

395
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,890
He said that there's a lot to do at work,

396
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,910
but judging by his voice he's not in a good mood.

397
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,130
So I was wondering if he's making excuses when it's actually because of you.

398
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,530
I'll hang up for now.

399
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,890
We finished the quantity check, right?

400
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,850
Yes, all we have to do now is put aside the spare quantity.

401
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,210
(Sir)

402
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,090
Take it.

403
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:19,510
No, it's okay.

404
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,350
It's a call I don't need to take.

405
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:22,670
(Sir)

406
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,820
I heard that you won't be able to go today.

407
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,720
If it's because you'll be getting off work late,

408
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,190
let me know and I'll go pick you up.

409
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,360
I'm in Seoul right now.

410
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,340
You're making me curious.

411
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,220
Why are you

412
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:35,200
making a face that I've never seen before during the five years we've dated?

413
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,510
Who is the reason behind that face?

414
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:41,650
Go inside.

415
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,860
I need to make a call.

416
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,390
Yoon Taejoon.

417
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,040
Stop it.

418
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,200
I have no feelings left for you.

419
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,590
So stay if you want to.

420
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,040
No one is available to take your call.

421
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,360
At the tone...

422
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,620
Mr. Yoon,

423
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:17,350
preparations are done. We will start briefing now.

424
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:17,880
Okay.

425
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,880
(Sir)

426
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,360
The introduction of a pottery class that is close to nature

427
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:52,370
will not only impact the company's image, -Hello?

428
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:54,890
Hello?

429
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:57,620
Ji Wonyoung.

430
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,800
Don't hang up and wait for me.

431
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,810
Please excuse me, something urgent came up.

432
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,130
I'm so annoyed.

433
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,750
Why didn't you pick up?

434
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,200
I was busy.

435
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,720
Why did you call me?

436
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,740
Shouldn't you have at least texted me?

437
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,160
You saw my text.

438
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,230
You also never answered my calls last time.

439
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,050
Nor did you text me.

440
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:38,490
Okay.

441
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,290
I heard that you won't be able to make it tonight,

442
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,550
is that right?

443
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,270
I already called and apologized in advance.

444
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,570
He said he understands.

445
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,410
I can go and pick you up at around 10 P.M.

446
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:49,830
I'm in Seoul right now.

447
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,460
It's okay.

448
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,820
Will you still be working by then?

449
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,780
Then I'll wait... -No.

450
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:00,420
I just,

451
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,600
don't want to see you.

452
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:09,980
What...

453
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,000
did you just

454
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,679
say?

455
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,110
I'll hang up now.

456
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,720
(Unintentional Love Story)

457
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,290
Why don't you want to see me?

458
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,700
Isn't it a good thing if I don't see you?

459
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,970
I thought you said you're sick of me.

460
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:08,020
Why do you use the weakness of someone you love to control them?

461
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,170
Wonyoung!

462
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,540
I like a sexy hispanic. -Do I
need to

463
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,430
learn Spanish?

464
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,020
Everyone's still talking about how he has connections.

465
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,700
I thought Mr. Yoon was the one who had his back.

466
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:21,770
Wonyoung, Mr. Yoon just told us that he's going to terminate the contract.

467
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,540
I hope you will use me as much as possible.
