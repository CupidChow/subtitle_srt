(Unintentional Love Story)

11
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,560
From now on I'm going to do something crazy,

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,140
and if it upsets you you can hit me.

13
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:01,960
I...

14
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,750
like you, sir.

15
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,820
I'm sorry for misunderstanding

16
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,200
and confessing on my own.

17
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,240
You really are dumb.

18
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,090
No...

19
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:42,610
this...

20
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,770
it isn't supposed to be like this...

21
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,110
Are you okay?

22
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,360
No...

23
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,940
I'm so embarrassed I think I'm going to die...

24
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,440
Wonyoung.

25
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,540
Sir, the person you like...

26
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,270
isn't it Aeri from the carpentry shop...

27
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,100
It's you.

28
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,650
Was that such a hard question?

29
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,240
Or,

30
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,070
are you purposely avoiding it?

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,910
Did you already know

32
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,829
that I like you?

33
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:22,740
To some extent.

34
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,600
Then why didn't you tell me?

35
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,270
Because it's fun?

36
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,270
I endured it

37
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,770
because I wanted to be careful.

38
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:32,079
But,

39
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,000
it became harder to withstand

40
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,240
having to hold back the feelings of

41
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,680
wanting to treat you better.

42
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,460
It doesn't seem like you endured much...

43
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,510
I was confused.

44
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,750
I wondered why you were being so nice to me when you already have someone you like.

45
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,740
Will you

46
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,900
date me?

47
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:16,900
Well,

48
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,140
there's no reason not to.

49
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,700

53
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,930
Did something happen?

54
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:14,790
What?

55
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,860
Am I hallucinating?

56
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,010
Should we run away?

57
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,280
Are you not going to eat?

58
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,570
I prepared for his birthday party but he disappears?

59
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,800
No one is available to take your call.

60
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,140
At the tone,

61
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,200
please record your message.

62
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,280
Wow.

63
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,580
Seriously.

64
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,300
Unloyal jerk.

65
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,590
But I like it.

66
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,940
Don't like it.

67
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,310
What?

68
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,120
Anything.

69
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:48,540
But,

70
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,600
why aren't you drinking?

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,370
I won't do anything

72
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,970
so drink with me.

73
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,800
In your dreams.

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,700
If I were to die I'd rather die than drink with you.

75
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,590
Why?

76
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,190
Because you don't want me to know how you really feel,

77
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,360
right?

78
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,750
I thought about it.

79
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,000
Don't think about it.

80
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,090
Are you mad because

81
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,610
I didn't just say "let's date"

82
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,580
but said "only for a month"?

83
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,220
When's the last time you came to the beach?

84
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,810
I don't know.

85
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,320
I was too busy looking for a job.

86
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:08,780
Ah...

87
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,950
No one's here.

88
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,280
It's not that...

89
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,200
I'm just a bit nervous.

90
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,790
Happy birthday.

91
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,140
You remembered.

92
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:27,670
Of course.

93
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,050
I even prepared a present.

94
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:30,840
Present?

95
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,790
I made a desk lamp.

96
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,470
Desk lamp?

97
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,260
But I'm not going to give it to you.

98
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,490
Oh, why?

99
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,950
I'll put it in the room you used before

100
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,850
so if you want to see it

101
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,180
come back.

102
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,440
Ah...

103
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,010
even so I can't...

104
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,180
shamelessly...

105
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,820
I know right?

106
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,200
Why did you leave in the first place

107
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,090
and make things complicated?

108
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,620
I had no choice.

109
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,810
At the time, being together in the same space was hard for me.

110
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,440
I didn't like myself for liking you

111
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,060
and I was scared that I'll get used to your kindness.

112
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,010
But even so it's not like I had a place to release these feelings

113
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,290
so I couldn't do anything else besides running away.

114
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,580
I'm sorry.

115
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:32,500
♫ I can't stop it anymore, the moment our eyes meet. I understand the worried look in your eyes ♫

116
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,210
♫ I can't stop myself, I know you feel the same way ♫

117
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,240
You can laugh at me for being childish.

118
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,020
(Ji Wonyoung ♡ Sir)

119
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,600
I've always wanted to try doing this.

(Ji Wonyoung ♡ Sir)

121
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,180
I also like childish jokes.
(Ji Wonyoung ♡ Sir)

122
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,200
I also like childish jokes.

123
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,870
I wish the world was this small.

124
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,220
Then no matter where we are

125
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,770
I can still see you.

126
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,610
I can see you.

127
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,040
Brother,

128
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,350
I'm sorry.

129
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,480
Were you shocked because I disappeared?

130
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,110
Not really.

131
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,820
I guessed that you left with Cha Jooheon.

132
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,960
He found out...

133
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,420
(Vice-manager Jung Seonho)

134
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,140
Yes, vice-manager.

135
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:11,470
You finally picked up.

136
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,140
Wonyoung you seem really busy these days.

137
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:14,820
Ah...

138
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,910
I'm sorry.

139
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,920
Does Mr. Yoon

140
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,200
seem like he's going to make a comeback soon?

141
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,640
No, it doesn't seem like it.

142
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,820
After his appearance at the seminar in China,

143
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,620
a lot of rumors have risen about whether or not he'll be making a comeback.

144
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,220
Wonyoung?

145
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,550
Ah... I'm

146
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,040
really busy right now

147
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,890
so I'll call you back.

148
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,140
I'm sorry!

149
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,380
I should make things clear and quit.

150
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,620
It's not like

151
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,990
Taepyeong is the only company out there.

152
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,750
Overlap it... -Okay.

153
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,040
Without it cracking...

154
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,570
Bit by bit... -Ah~

155
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,070
Teacher!

156
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,570
Help me look at this!

157
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,540
I can't seem to do this part well.

158
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,740
You just need to do it like this.

159
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,370
Ji Wonyoung.

160
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,920
How come you can't even do the basics properly?

161
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,930
You've already taken so many classes.

162
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,250
Ah! Let's continue after eating.

163
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,040
I'm hungry.

164
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,540
Teacher! We'll be back after eating.

165
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,830
Okay.

166
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,980
Let's continue after eating~

167
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,900
Hurry up~

168
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,950
Are you still able to eat

169
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,410
after making it like this?

170
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,870
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,500
We'll be back after we eat.

172
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,850
Okay, enjoy your meal.

173
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,410
Ugh... you were joking, right?

174
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,950
I'm not doing this.

175
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,410
You're so cute.

176
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:36,930
Ugh.

177
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,280
I'm disappointed.

178
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:41,560
I thought

179
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,900
you were falling for me because of my looks.

180
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,530
I'm really handsome, okay!

181
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,320
I never said I fell for you because you're cute.

182
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,190
I

183
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,940
100%

184
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,860
fell for you because of your looks.

185
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,870
All I need is to get my phone

186
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:52,870
why are you following me?

187
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,090
Come on~ let's go together~

188
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,040
I'll give our teacher some snacks.

189
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,110
Shh! Don't move.

190
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,640
Oh? Where did he go?

191
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,690
I wanted to give him some snacks.

192
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,810
No but,

193
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,790
I don't know if Wonyoung will like her.

194
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,250
My niece is pretty and popular.

195
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,630
Aren't you pushing it onto him even though he doesn't like it?

196
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,420
No! I tried hinting it at him last time

197
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,010
and it didn't seem like he was against it.

198
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,060
Really?

199
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:27,570
Look.

200
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,870
Look here, here.

201
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,620
Oh my~ so pretty~ -She looks pure, right?

202
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,930
But I'm so hungry, hurry up.

203
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,290
No, she's really pure~

204
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,310
I'm hungry~

205
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:44,900
No, I

206
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,790
never asked for a blind date.

207
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,640
So is that how she found out your type?

208
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,100
That's because...

209
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,260
I just went with the most common type...

210
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,620
that's why.

211
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,280
Ugh.

212
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,000
You're joking around again, right?

213
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,500
But,

214
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,140
let's change your ideal type.

215
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,790
Being pure is a bit...

216
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:05,760
Sir,

217
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,270
what are you doing here?

218
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,500
It's just

219
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,180
I usually see you hanging laundry here at this hour.

220
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,150
You came to see me, right?

221
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,119
Are you not going to finish hanging the laundry?

222
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:18,950
I will~

223
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,069
I don't think you're doing it properly.

224
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,170
I am.

225
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,570
The men in my family

226
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,350
are really good at working with their hands.

227
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,380
But I don't think that includes me.

228
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,350
Really?

229
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,080
My dad is really good at sculpting.

230
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,620
When I was younger,

231
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,900
he would pick up pieces of wood

232
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,500
and make birds and dogs

233
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,500
out of it for me.

234
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,100
Seems like you have a lot of memories with your dad.

235
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,740
It is

236
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:05,820
pretty unique.

237
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,200
I was told a lot by others that we had a different father-son relationship.

238
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,500
I

239
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,260
inherited a lot of my dad's talents at using his hands.

240
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,020
But,

241
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,930
I don't have memories like the ones you have.

242
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,740
Rather than treating me as a son

243
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,940
he treated me more like a disciple.

244
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,440
It seems like he was pretty strict.

245
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,830
I've never felt like I received love from my dad.

246
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,340
Even at such a young age

247
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,130
I thought,

248
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,280
"he gets zero points as a father".

249
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,310
Ah...

250
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,770
I was comforting you.

251
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,010
Come on, stop.

252
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,020
Ah,

253
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,350
I plan on going to Seoul on my day off.

254
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,260
There are things I need to do and it's been a long time since I last saw my friends so I miss them.

255
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:16,930
Sir.

256
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,930
I don't want you to.

257
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,360
But I

258
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,040
can't say that, right?

259
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,780
Are you perhaps

260
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,590
jealous?

261
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:33,950
No.

262
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,190
You're jealous, right?

263
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,680
Thank you

264
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,460
for coming to me.

265
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,380
That's my line.

266
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:10,960
Do it.

267
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,520
Do everything you want.

268
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,790
But,

269
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,670
just don't like.

270
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,480
Cheers!

271
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,760
Why does our Wonyoung seem a bit down today?

272
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,340
Leave him be, he doesn't seem like he's in a good condition today.

273
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:44,870
Why?

274
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,380
Do people hit you at work?

275
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,600
Is your boss a sociopath?

276
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,170
Even if you're tired,

277
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,250
you got into a large company so you should... hm?

278
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:54,130
Oh?

279
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,560
Oh my.

280
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,050
Just stay put if you don't know anything.

281
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:01,730
What's wrong with him?

282
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:07,780
Oh, Yeonhee you're here!

283
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,420
Yeonhee's here, Yeonhee's here!

284
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,070
It's been so long!

285
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,940
I was sending out invitations and told her to come. -Come sit down.

286
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,030
It's been a while, guys.

287
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,640
Hey, let's fill our glasses. Yeonhee's here so we should cheers together.

288
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,400
Everyone hold your glasses~

289
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:26,000
Here, here, cheers!

290
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,140
Hey, I'm going to go take a smoke.

291
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,840
Me too, let's go together.

292
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,210
I see that you still don't smoke.

293
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,980
I was surprised back then when you didn't smoke even during your military leave.

294
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:36,930
You remember everything.

295
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,210
Of course I remember.

296
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:39,760
Hey,

297
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,590
did you not know that I liked you?

298
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,390
You liked me?

299
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,620
Wow... seriously.

300
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,820
I get that you weren't interested

301
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,070
but everyone in our major knew

302
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,030
except for you.

303
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:49,700
Sorry,

304
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,390
I really didn't notice.

305
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:51,990
You don't need to apologize.

306
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,240
What about now?

307
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:55,800
Are you dating anyone?

308
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:58,850
Ah...

309
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:01,850
yeah.

310
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,290
Really? How long has it been?

311
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,180
It hasn't been long.

312
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:08,210
But why do you seem so down? This should be the best time.

313
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,050
I unintentionally lied about something

314
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,060
but if I tell the truth

315
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,310
I'm scared that he'll

316
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,110
never see me again.

317
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,330
Wow...

318
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,920
did you finally meet the one?

319
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,900
Wonyoung,

320
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,270
do you know why I liked you?

321
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,640
It's because you're honest.

322
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:30,930
Super honest.

323
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,540
I mean,

324
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:36,410
it did hurt a bit to be able to tell by your eyes that you had zero interest in me.

325
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:37,930
But

326
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,360
it made me realize that it's possible to be selfless

327
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,850
and honest at the same time.

328
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,790
It surprised me to see that

329
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,200
someone like this exists in today's world.

330
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,280
You're complimenting me too much.

331
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,790
So don't use being scared as an excuse

332
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,050
and just be yourself.

333
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,210
A relationship that is built on lies

334
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,550
will eventually fall apart.

335
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,380
Let's go home.

336
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,340
Hey, be careful.

337
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,700
You guys can't be this drunk already, okay?

338
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:18,160
Second round... -We're not going to another round.

339
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,310
Hey, isn't this your dream car?

340
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:24,300
This is so pretty.

341
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:31,280
Sir.

342
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:41,770
Hello,

343
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,220
I'm a close brother of Wonyoung's.

344
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,190
It's pretty late so I came to pick him up,

345
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,950
but it seems like he's really drunk

346
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,990
since he needs someone to hold onto him.

347
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,500
Um... we didn't tell him to drink, he drank because of work...

348
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,750
Hey, the drinks were so good today, right?

349
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,100
We should go grab another drink

350
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,640
but sorry guys I'll be going first. Go home safe, okay?

351
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,670
Let's go, sir.

352
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,680
Go home safe, Wonyoung!

353
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,570
Then let's go for another drink by ourselves.

354
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,070
Hey, should we go eat sashimi?

355
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:20,910
Let's go for a second round.

356
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,430
Bye Wonyoung~

357
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:35,840
Why

358
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,800
did you not tell me...

359
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,700
Compared to not seeing you until tomorrow,

360
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,050
I'd rather be tired.

361
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:05,490
Look at me

362
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,250
Ah,

363
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,340
now I feel alive.

364
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,300
Sir,

365
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,980
there's something I need to tell you

366
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,550
so can we go somewhere to talk? Anywhere.

367
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,370
It's something important

368
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,290
so I don't want to talk in the car.

369
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,770
Isn't this place really expensive?

370
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,420
I sold a lot of plates today,

371
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,490
so order whatever you want.

372
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,680
Yoon Taejoon?

373
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,120
Taejoon!

374
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,470
I don't think our relationship is the type where we can greet each other happily.

375
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,760
I think you're handsome when you're mad.

376
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,490
We were talking about something important

377
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,600
and I don't want to be interrupted.

378
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,620
I'm also busy,

379
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,840
I came to have a meeting with the hotel staff.

380
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:21,130
They asked to display my works in the lobby.

381
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,750
It's too bad, if you came a few days later

382
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,180
you would've been able to see it, too.

383
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,640
Well,

384
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,650
I'm not interested in the works of someone

385
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,240
who makes art like a form of business.

386
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,090
Don't you think

387
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,000
it's wrong of you to come here with someone else?

388
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,300
You should leave.

389
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,160
Okay,

390
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,090
it's not like there's only today.

391
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,800
Did that surprise you?

392
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,600
Ah, yes.

393
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,370
Your name...

394
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:22,690
I think

395
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,540
we should drink rather than eat.

396
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:00,710
Ah...

397
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,880
That guy from earlier

398
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,090
was my upperclassman in university.

399
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,790
From getting discharged to getting into grad school...

400
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,980
we dated for

401
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,420
five years.

402
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,960
I can't say it was a good relationship,

403
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,720
but it was a steady one.

404
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,130
Painter Yoon Seongguk,

405
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:33,700
do you know him?

406
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,070
He's my father.

407
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,290
Thanks to that,

408
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,310
a lot of people approached me with the hopes of using me.

409
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:48,980
Including that person.

410
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,360
Then,

411
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,180
did you move to Gangneung

412
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,050
because of him?

413
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,950
I couldn't trust anyone anymore.

414
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,860
So I think I moved to run away

415
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,190
from the life of Yoon Taejoon.

416
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,600
Wonyoung,

417
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,640
I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

418
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,200
No, please don't apologize.

419
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,440
This isn't something you need to apologize for.

420
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:34,620
Everyone tells lies whether it's big or small.

421
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,750
Of course, I'm not saying that that's the right thing to do.

422
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,540
There can be times when

423
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,350
it just can't be helped.

424
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,130
Please don't apologize.

425
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,210
Thank you.

426
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:52,650
Ah,

427
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:54,790
Wonyoung,

428
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:58,210
didn't you say earlier that you had something to tell me?

429
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,330
Ah...

430
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,180
I...

431
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,280
Wait, if you drink it all at once...

432
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,590
This amount is okay.

433
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,900
I want to have another glass.

434
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,340
You'll have to bear the consequences

435
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,700
for your actions.

436
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,080
It's so hot...

437
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,120
Endure it.

438
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:09,930
Sir,

439
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,700
am I drunk again?

440
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,180
Did I,

441
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,120
dance like this again?

442
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,550
You didn't dance today.

443
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,850
I'm sorry, sir.

444
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,230
I didn't know I was going to fall for you.

445
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,510
I did that because I didn't know.

446
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,100
I'd prefer it if you confessed to me

447
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:08,090
when you're sober.

448
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,820
I'm sorry, sir.

449
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,130
I'm really sorry.

450
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,180
For what?

451
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,320
Wonyoung?

452
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,409
Wonyoung?

453
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,510
Ah... welcome, Wonyoung.

454
00:34:59,330 --> 00:34:59,760
Have a seat.

455
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:07,480
I couldn't get in contact with you so I never thought you would ask to meet first.

456
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,030
What's wrong?

457
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,210
I thought I should tell you this in person.

458
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,220
I

459
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:19,610
have decided

460
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,130
to quit doing this job.

461
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,840
What is this suddenly?

462
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,700
Did Mr. Yoon find out?

463
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,130
No.

464
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:30,950
I can't

465
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,010
lie to him anymore.

466
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,870
This wasn't the right thing to do from the beginning.

467
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,580
Wonyoung,

468
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,060
if you do this,

469
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,020
you won't be able to

470
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,710
get your job back.

471
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,260
I'm planning to resign.

472
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,840
I will return the activity fees soon.

473
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,500
I want to ask for one favor.

474
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,590
Before I tell Mr. Yoon myself,

475
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,190
please keep this a secret.

476
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:03,060
Wait so,

477
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,540
you're going to tell him the truth?

478
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,920
If you do that,

479
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,000
what will Mr. Yoon think of Taepyeong?

480
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:13,960
If you do that there will for sure be a problem the next time we sign a contract.

481
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,760
I'll tell him that this was my idea.

482
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,250
I won't bring trouble to the company.

483
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,050
Please trust me.

484
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,390
Wow.

485
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:55,940
Where did you go?

486
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,280
Ah,

487
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,980
there was something I needed to do.

488
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,020
Why did you turn your phone off?

489
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:00,740
Is it off?

490
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,140
There's no way...

491
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,340
Ah...

492
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,750
there's no battery.

493
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,270
I didn't charge it yesterday.

494
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,030
I'm sorry,

495
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,120
I only went out for a bit so I didn't think you'd be worried.

496
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,540
How can I not be worried?

497
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,330
With what happened yesterday,

498
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:26,440
and you continuously apologizing for no reason,

499
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:30,020
then suddenly disappearing in the morning.

500
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,550
I only know your phone number

501
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,650
so if you disappear like this,

502
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,740
I can't help but think I won't be able to find you.

503
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:53,130
I was wrong.

504
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:57,280
I won't do this again.

505
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,310
I just need to finish my resignation process.

506
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,780
Please wait for me,

507
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,410
I'll sort everything out.

508
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,700
Hello.

509
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,040
Oh,

510
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,780
it's Wonyoung.

511
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:04,940
Ah,

512
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,990
Taejoon is inside so you should go in.

513
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,920
Thank you.

514
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,540
I'm the one who's thankful.

515
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,690
Thank you for getting Taejoon

516
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,200
to start working with clay again.

517
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,940
Surprise!

518
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:47,660
Oh?

519
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,480
I came to look for my lover who was stolen by a jar.

520
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:53,880
Ah...

521
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,550
I thought I was hallucinating.

522
00:39:59,110 --> 00:39:59,950
Here!

523
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,870
Once you start working you don't eat anything.

524
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,510
I pulled an all-nighter so...

525
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,460
Did I interrupt you?

526
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:46,890
Of course not.

527
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:50,250
Ah,

528
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,790
now I feel alive.

529
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:14,990
That's good to hear.

530
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,770
You haven't eaten yet, right?

531
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,990
I made some tteokbokki

532
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,660
and it tastes amazing.

533
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,600
Really?

534
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,260
Let's eat it together.

535
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,350
Oh right, the taxi.

536
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:48,470
I need to leave right away to go tutor Hotae.

537
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,340
I'll head to the pension

538
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,780
after I'm done.

539
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:00,490
Really?

540
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,790
You said so!

541
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,240
I'll be waiting.

542
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:07,960
Be careful.

543
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,010
You too, sir.

544
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,880
It's good.

545
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:55,250
Wonyoung,

546
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,170
I'm at Mr. Yoon's workshop, where are...

547
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:13,110
You should

548
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,440
do some explaining.

549
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:26,060
(Unintentional Love Story)

550
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:29,930
It's finally back.

551
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,360
I couldn't even contact you.

552
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:33,930
Hm?

553
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,160
You're the part-timer at my shop not here, okay?

554
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:39,260
Sir! Sir!

555
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:40,520
Just date me for a month.

556
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:42,630
If you leave it there, I'll take care of it.

557
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,090
I'll go.

558
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,350
Sir.

559
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,540
Ji Wonyoung, let's never see each other again.
