11
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,440
Are you normally this hardworking at everything?

12
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:38,620
Huh?

13
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:41,540
It's just...

14
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,010
it feels like you are doing way more than you need to.

15
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,730
It's a habit. I always feel like there's something chasing after me.

16
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,580
That if I don't work hard, there won't be a next time.

17
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,520
Shouldn't it be that if there's this time, there should be a next time?

18
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,960
Just

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,790
relax a little. Only by relaxing

20
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,630
will there be a next time.

21
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,030
Ah...

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,940
Just take the time you're doing pottery

23
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,090
as your resting time.

24
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,710
Just...

25
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:22,950
Something like this.

26
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,070
So I will feel more at ease too.

27
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:33,340
Ah...

28
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,030
Here.

29
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,750
There's clay water.

30
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,210
I thought I cleaned it up.

31
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:44,630
Stop rubbing it.

32
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,009
It's becoming red.

33
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,990
My heart fluttered so hard.

34
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,690
But why am I nervous?

35
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,710
Ha... I'm speechless.

36
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,050
I'm going crazy.

37
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,040
Professor.

38
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,850
Oh, Taejoon is here.

39
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,220
Sorry for being late.

40
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,800
You rascal. You terrible rascal.

41
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,380
You hid so well. You're only looking for me when I'm about to die.

42
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,790
You don't find it unfair, do you?

43
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,550
Be it cerebral infarction or lung cancer,

44
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,740
you were looking forward for

45
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,860
either one of them to happen.

46
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,500
You rascal.

47
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:40,900
Is that

48
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:43,660
what a bad student who keeps making

49
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,380
their professor worry should be saying?

50
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,060
Sorry.

51
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,500
I won't ask you where and how you're living.

52
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,780
Just don't let go of clay

53
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,079
and don't give up on the life of a potter.

54
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,530
That's why Professor should live longer.

55
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,520
Because you still

56
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,740
have to see them in the future.

57
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,380
You don't even have to say that for it to happen.

58
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,470
Taejoon.

59
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,920
I knew you would come.

60
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,610
Professor liked you so much.

61
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:08,730
Has it been...

62
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,450
2 years since we last met?

63
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,980
You haven't changed at all.

64
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,910
Or not?

65
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,820
Your hair has gotten longer.

66
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,740
You haven't changed at all either.

67
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:26,820
Huh.

68
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,980
I've changed a lot.

69
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,090
Is that so?

70
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,250
You're as shameless as you used to be.

71
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,460
I don't have skills so I have to be shameless. What else can I do?

72
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,290
I know a lot of people are criticizing me

73
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,110
for using the people around me to make a living by selling their works.

74
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,280
But what's funny is,

75
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,470
everyone doesn't deny the fact that I have succeeded.

76
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,120
Taejoon.

77
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,130
That's enough.

78
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,690
Thank you, Painter Yoon.

79
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,050
As we promised, I won't meet Taejoon anymore.

80
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,860
Rest assured.

81
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,710
Director,

82
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,140
where are you?

83
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,230
Are you going to be back late today?

84
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,610
He didn't even put up a notice on not opening today. Where could he have gone?

85
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,250
Donghee!

86
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,810
Oh, who is this?

87
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,250
Isn't this the precious part-timer?

88
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,590
I went to the hospital just now.

89
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,760
They said it won't leave a scar as long as I take care of my blister.

90
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:18,850
Really?

91
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,200
That's a relief. I was so worried.

92
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,490
I came back because I was a little worried

93
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,900
but it seems like everything's fine?

94
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,960
Oh, are we not doing deliveries now?

95
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,840
Hah...

96
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:32,950
About that?

97
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,100
I've delivered to the fruit store.

98
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,570
He has been helping me.

99
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:45,890
What?

100
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,740
I heard you're sick.

101
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,690
Why are you here?

102
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,040
I'm fine now. I can come back to work very soon.

103
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,450
You're fine?

104
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,030
Really?

105
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,570
Ahh!

106
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,750
You don't look all that fine though?

107
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,760
I'm fine!

108
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,160
Go Hotae!

109
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,890
Stop bullying him and go do your deliveries.

110
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,530
Are you okay, Wonyoung?

111
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,790
I think you should go have some Dulri hangover soup.

112
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,860
You haven't eaten yet right?

113
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,460
Yes. Let's eat together.

114
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,170
Hey!

115
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,950
What about me? Do I not get to eat?

116
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,280
The way he speaks, seriously. I really want to sew up

117
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,270
that stinky mouth of his.

118
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,770
Then come and eat together after you're done delivering.

119
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,710
Let's go, Wonyoung.

120
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:37,710
Yes.

121
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,140
Eat slowly!

122
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,840
Eat really slowly!

123
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:49,970
Donghee...

124
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,490
Do you happen to know where Director has gone?

125
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,370
Juheon?

126
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,820
Who knows? I didn't see him this morning either.

127
00:10:59,320 --> 00:10:59,670
Why?

128
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,510
I can't contact him, and he didn't come back home yesterday.

129
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,270
Home?

130
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,880
Ah... I'm staying at Director's home.

131
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,390
What?

132
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,570
You have been staying at Juheon's place?

133
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:12,670
Donghee?

134
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:14,390
Donghee!

135
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:14,780
Huh?

136
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,020
Sorry I'm just a little shocked...

137
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,220
I don't have a place to stay, so I think he took a pity on me.

138
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,070
How could that be? He's not the type to bring people home randomly.

139
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,520
Eat up.

140
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,040
Is he not going to come back today too?

141
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,090
Huh?

142
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,060
You're back?

143
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,920
I was worried since I couldn't contact you.

144
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,480
Sir?

145
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,740
Sir? Sir?

146
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,770
Wake up, Sir.

147
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,700
Medication... Medication...

148
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,220
Sir,

149
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,660
stay... stay here just for a while.

150
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,170
I will go buy the medication.

151
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,980
Sorry! I would like to buy some medication. Just one!

152
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,460
Sir.

153
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,730
Try waking up for a while. Sleep after taking your medication.

154
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,410
What should I do...

155
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,440
Is there any way to make him take his medication...

156
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,410
Give it to me.

157
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:21,750
Here.

158
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:27,990
Ah...

159
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,440
Thank you, for having thought this far

160
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:33,970
for me.

161
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,410
I can finally heave a sigh of relief now.

162
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,350
Sir.

163
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,380
Sorry for not giving you a call.

164
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,690
You didn't submit any reports yesterday and today.

165
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,940
You've already move into Potter Yoon's place

166
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,040
so I thought there might be some progress.

167
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,510
Stop saying that.

168
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,860
He scared the living out of me just now.

169
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,590
He suddenly had a high fever and there was no medication.

170
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,180
I wanted to bring him to the hospital but he couldn't even get up.

171
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,350
He's finally sleeping now after I fed him medication.

172
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,740
I was going to give you a call tomorrow.

173
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,540
Wonyoung,

174
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,830
nice one!

175
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,700
This will definitely be very effective.

176
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:41,950
Huh?

177
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,570
I mean.

178
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:47,020
There's nothing I'd be more grateful than someone taking care of me when I'm sick myself.

179
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,050
This is way more meaningful than having moved into his place,

180
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:50,680
right?

181
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,120
Uh...

182
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,830
I guess.

183
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,270
It's a good chance.

184
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,750
A good chance...

185
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,030
Why are you sleeping here?

186
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:27,900
Huh... Huh?

187
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,610
What time is it?

188
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,180
I was going to wake you up when you should take your medication

189
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,610
but fell asleep...

190
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,010
Your fever seem to have subsided.

191
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,390
You can already move around?

192
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:53,930
It's thanks to you.

193
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:54,890
It's a relief.

194
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,310
When I get stressed, I would get sick.

195
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,400
But it was

196
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,200
very serious yesterday.

197
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,080
When I was coming back yesterday, I bought some porridge.

198
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,730
Have that and take your medication again.

199
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:21,920
Thank you.

200
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:22,910
Huh?

201
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,220
I said thank you.

202
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:29,500
Ah.

203
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,640
I owe so much to you.

204
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,830
This is nothing.

205
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,190
But...

206
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,870
I'm not in the position to be thanked...

207
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,140
Sorry.

208
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,680
I don't have experience driving on gravel.

209
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:08,570
Firstly,

210
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,340
let's wash it.

211
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,420
I was very anxious yesterday, and it was raining.

212
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,100
It was also really dark last night.

213
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,500
But I drove it very carefully!

214
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:28,650
Huh?

215
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,830
Ah...

216
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,300
It's dented here.

217
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,340
Huh?

218
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,240
W-where?

219
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,590
Oh no...

220
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,980
What do I do...

221
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,620
Where is it?

222
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,180
Are you pulling my leg?

223
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,300
That's too much.

224
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,270
Do you think I'm the type of unreasonable person who'd get mad

225
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,950
at my savior just for a scratch on my car?

226
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,120
No, that's not it...

227
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,320
Anyway, that scared me!

228
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,010
Just wash the car quickly and set off.

229
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:25,680
Where to?

230
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,130
You can't

231
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,100
have done that on purpose, right...

232
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,000
It's not.

233
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,130
Huh?

234
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,480
So you did that on purpose?

235
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,610
Could it be?

236
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:58,950
♫ I can't stop it ♫
Could it be?

237
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:02,890
♫ I can't stop it ♫

238
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:03,930
♫ Don't stop, don't stop, keep going ♫

239
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:04,520
Ji Wonyoung.
♫ Don't stop, don't stop, keep going ♫

240
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:04,740
♫ Don't stop, don't stop, keep going ♫

241
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,290
Sir!
♫ Don't stop, don't stop, keep going ♫

242
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:05,750
♫ Don't stop, don't stop, keep going ♫

243
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,670
As for washing the car–

244
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,360
Stop right there.

245
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:07,450
♫ Like me, I've fallen into you ♫
Stop right there.

246
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:11,210
♫ Like me, I've fallen into you ♫

247
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,630
♫ You came over ♫

248
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,140
♫ with beautiful flowers ♫

249
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:23,580
♫ I fall in love, this is just like a traffic accident ♫

250
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:28,230
♫ A traffic accident between you and me ♫

251
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:32,660
♫ Your gaze is making my heart race ♫

252
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,980
♫ In your smile, my heart goes to you ♫

253
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,390
♫ I promise you, if you wanna be mine ♫

254
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:45,240
♫ I promise us, a traffic accident only between the two of us ♫

255
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:49,100
♫ I give you this line ♫

256
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:53,950
♫ This moment is getting deeper, more and more ♫

257
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,000
Whoa.

258
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:13,870
Is this a kiln?

259
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:14,960
Yes.

260
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:19,520
I will show you more of the kiln next time we are making something.

261
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:22,410
Come over this side.

262
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:35,950
Ah...

263
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,630
It's this smell.

264
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,790
There's a faint wet clay smell on you.

265
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,050
- Hmm? - I like that smell.

266
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,310
This way.

267
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,900
What you did last time has already been fired

268
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,340
so I'm going to teach you how to glaze it.

269
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,130
Like this.

270
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,660
Stir the glaze well.

271
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:05,230
Huh?

272
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:09,860
Ah, this.

273
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,810
I got burned by a spark from the kiln.

274
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,100
After all, this is a job where I can't leave fire.

275
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:18,990
It must've been painful.

276
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,760
No matter how you got the injury...

277
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,150
An injury is an injury after all.

278
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,370
♫ Unknowingly, my heart got taken away by you ♫

279
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:48,510
♫ I see nothing but you now ♫

280
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:56,660
♫ I'm going to show you my feelings now ♫

281
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:05,540
♫ Because ♫

282
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:15,450
♫ I'm falling for you, I'm falling for you ♫

283
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,610
What are you looking at?

284
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,220
Nothing!

285
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,240
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

286
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,580
Sure.

287
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:30,850
Oh.

288
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:33,930
You're going like this?

289
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:37,830
Ah...

290
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,540
Hey, Kim Donghee! Do you think I'm a watch dog for your store?

291
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,440
If you don't come quickly I'll–

292
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,390
Hello?

293
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,770
Hello?

294
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,210
Damn him!

295
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,350
Bye.

296
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,510
Go home safely...

297
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,270
Ah! The photo.

298
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,120
You just have to get into trouble on my birthday, don't you?

299
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,590
How would I know she'd come?

300
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,470
It's not the day I meet her today.

301
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,570
How many people do you meet at one time–

302
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:51,990
Let me take a look.

303
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,120
It's nothing.

304
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,730
Shit it's kinda deep.

305
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,570
What are you going to do?

306
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,920
Your already ugly face is going to look even more fierce.

307
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,320
It's fine.

308
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,850
You like girls that much?

309
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,270
I'm not meeting them because I particularly like them though.

310
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,190
Yeah right.

311
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,960
Ah! It hurts!

312
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,460
Is there... anything else?

313
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,040
Have you tried this?

314
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,760
Pick something.

315
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,780
It's fine.

316
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,410
Just pick one. The time's running out.

317
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,770
Anything's fine.

318
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:18,990
See?

319
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,400
Kim Donghee,

320
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,230
happy birthday.

321
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,240
I'm so damn thankful.

322
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,570
Keep it well for your whole life.

323
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,150
Sure. In the trash can.

324
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,700
I'm going crazy for real.

325
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,900
Welcome–

326
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:02,850
What are you doing?

327
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,640
Why are you here so late?

328
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,350
Didn't you tell me to come quickly?

329
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,360
You're still here though?

330
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,600
Can't you see I'm staying to make sure you won't run away without buying me a meal?

331
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,860
Did you leave your food with me or what?

332
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:19,420
Today is the last day I'm helping you with the delivery.

333
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,520
Oh, it slipped my mind.

334
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,830
Let's go have a meal.

335
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,130
Wait a bit.

336
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,660
The night air is so nice, right?

337
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,550
What's nice about it?

338
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,170
We're just going for a meal. How far out are we going?

339
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,140
It's over there. There's a new store that opened up over there.

340
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,480
We could've just gone to any store nearby.

341
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,560
Hey! You helped me so much with work.

342
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,220
Also...

343
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,130
I have to grant you a wish.

344
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,370
What the...

345
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,760
You're so scary for real.

346
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:13,560
Wonyoung!

347
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:14,970
Donghee!

348
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,340
You haven't eaten right?

349
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:27,210
Shall we go eat?

350
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,000
Yes! Sounds good.

351
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:31,550
Sir,

352
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:32,990
is that all right?

353
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:34,530
Huh?

354
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,440
U-uh...

355
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,060
Yes... Of course.

356
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:42,830
Oh!

357
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:43,970
Sky lanterns!

358
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,820
This person from Seoul...

359
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,670
Is it your first time seeing sky lanterns?

360
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,330
It is my first time seeing it...

361
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,070
For real?

362
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,970
Go Hotae, go buy some sky lanterns for Wonyoung.

363
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:58,690
Huh?

364
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,680
That's a waste of money though?

365
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,700
I told you to buy so just buy it.

366
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,060
Let's go.

367
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:14,760
Hey.

368
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,560
My throat's going to be sore.

369
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,870
What's the reason for hiding it even from me?

370
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,540
You took in Wonyoung, right?

371
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:29,980
Hey.

372
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,970
I only went to your place after knowing each other for one year.

373
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,510
It's a special situation.

374
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,020
He doesn't have anywhere suitable he could go.

375
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,350
He's going to go back to Seoul this year.

376
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,770
Though I know you have your own thoughts,

377
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,030
don't forget that.

378
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,730
He's a kid who's going to be just here for a short time.

379
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,460
Stop caring about it.

380
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:06,050
You...

381
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:08,730
Sir!

382
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:09,950
Donghee!

383
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:56,910
It's going up!

384
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,890
Have another glass, Wonyoung.

385
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,210
That's enough.

386
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:24,450
The market's closed tomorrow and there's nothing to do anyway.

387
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,280
He said he's all recovered now.

388
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,090
Yes!

389
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,480
I'm fine now.

390
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,240
You will be able to work once the market is open again, right?

391
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,980
Of course!

392
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,810
Thank you.

393
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,920
I will get a thank you gift from this guy over here

394
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,240
so don't worry about it too much.

395
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,330
What do you even want?

396
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,840
I'm hella scared, you rascal.

397
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,830
I'm going to get some fresh air.

398
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:06,450
Hey.

399
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:08,440
I'm leaving first.

400
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:25,550
It's so refreshing.

401
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,770
Shall we go?

402
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,139
You seem drunk.

403
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,780
About the wish you wrote down just now.

404
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,480
Was it something about love life?

405
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,050
Why?

406
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,140
It's just...

407
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,010
I want to know if someone like you

408
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,220
would also have concerns about things like this too.

409
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,600
You must be really popular.

410
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:30,470
You're handsome, and you're a nice person.

411
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,700
You must have no problem getting any person you like.

412
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,410
I didn't.

413
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,400
Why is that in past tense?

414
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,360
It seems a little different this time round.

415
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,240
Is there someone you really like?

416
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,300
I'm just

417
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,000
still considering if...

418
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:56,300
I could like them.

419
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,560
Hey.

420
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:01,030
What do you mean if you could like them?

421
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,390
If someone's liked by you,

422
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,580
they should be bowing and thanking you.

423
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,590
Do you really think that way?

424
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,110
Of course!

425
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,270
Tell me about it.

426
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,480
Let me help you analyze the situation.

427
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:18,760
I wonder...

428
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,710
I still haven't figured it out fully yet.

429
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,620
He's very different from

430
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:28,070
my ideal type normally.

431
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,970
I used to like people who are sturdy and adult-like,

432
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,470
but this person is completely not like that.

433
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,700
Ah...

434
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,960
I see.

435
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,020
So

436
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,450
I keep wanting to take care of them.

437
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,740
You definitely like them then.

438
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,440
And this person really can't catch a hint.

439
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:59,090
It must be hard on you.

440
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:04,030
♫ You make me strong ♫

441
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,090
