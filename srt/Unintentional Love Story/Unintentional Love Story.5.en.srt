(Unintentional Love Story)

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,420
I should tell you before you get drunk.

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:43,680
What is it?

13
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,200
Ah, the wish?

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,370
Alright,

15
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,050
let's hear it.

16
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,100
After you hear it you can't reject it.

17
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,440
You have to grant it.

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,960
You're crazy, who does that?

19
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,200
What if you say something insane.

20
00:00:59,310 --> 00:00:59,850
Nevermind,

21
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,630
just calculate the hourly wage and give me that.

22
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,680
Ugh what is it! I'm curious!

23
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,220
What is it!

24
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,060
Like I said, you can't say no.

25
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,690
What...

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
you want me to treat you as a superior for a week?

27
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,320
Or to not go to Dooly?

28
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,100
If it's to increase your wage by three times...

29
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,030
Go out

30
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:35,979
with me

31
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,110
for a month.

32
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,870
Not in a brotherly way

33
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,120
we should kiss

34
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,050
and sleep...

35
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,140
Ugh... am I writing a novel?

36
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,290
This is a report.

37
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,610
Class starts in 5 minutes.

38
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,310
Ah, right!

39
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,890
I'm here~

40
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,760
Oh?

41
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,580
You're here.

42
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,870
Sir, you look happy.

43
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:10,800
Makes sense,

44
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,470
they say that's the case when one falls in love.

45
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,190
What are you mumbling about?

46
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,060
It's nothing.

47
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:20,010
Sir, this is a pottery wheel, right?

48
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,150
Do you want to try it?

49
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,630
What?

50
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,300
Sir,

51
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,390
did you just ask a child

52
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,070
who just started walking

53
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,079
to do a spin kick?

54
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,000
Students that try a class for a day do this, too.

55
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,400
Don't be scared.

56
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,710
I'll show you.

57
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,050
First,

58
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,730
you need to smooth out the clay.

59
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,780
Make sure there are no clumps.

60
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,170
Like this, you can make the shape you want.

61
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,420
It's so fascinating, it's like magic.

62
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:44,730
Here,

63
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:47,780
have a seat.

64
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,710
Come on~ you're kidding, right?

65
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,290
This is really too much for me.

66
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,320
It speeds up when you step forwards on the pedal,

67
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,230
and slows down when you step backwards.

68
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,580
You should first stay centered

69
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,460
and form a pillar.

70
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,670
While staying centered, push down from the top

71
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,940
and dig inside.

72
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,840
Dig enough to make the shape you want.

73
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,570
Really,

74
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,400
but,

75
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,120
controlling my strength is harder than I thought.

76
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,430
Oh, oh!

77
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,990
Ah!

78
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,090
Spin it again.

79
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,610
Loosen your hands.

80
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,420
Your right hand should be the one using strength

81
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,230
and your left hand

82
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,020
just needs to rest here.

83
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,370
No but...

84
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:30,570
do you have to...

85
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,409
teach me like this?

86
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,600
Yes.

87
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,680
Ah... I see...

88
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,240
Sir you must be disappointed...

89
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,780
if it were a female student,

90
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,530
you'd probably be more nervous.

91
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,430
That might be the case

92
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,920
but just because it's a man,

93
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,620
you don't think I'll feel the same?

94
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,880
Ah... that's... that's right,

95
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,040
wheel classes are hard so it makes you nervous,

96
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,560
it has nothing to do with gender.

97
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:25,860
Haha...

98
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,909
If you keep practicing,

99
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,290
you'll get better.

100
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,410
So childish...

101
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,360
just because it's a man, you don't think I'll feel the same?

102
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,950
Ah... I couldn't sleep at all.

103
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,080
Ah!

104
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,310
Ah seriously!

105
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,160
Stop thinking about it.

106
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,950
Being next to someone so great

107
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,710
is making you nervous, that's all.

108
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,520
On top of that,

109
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,500
he has a woman he likes...

110
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,930
What does that have to do with me?

111
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,230
Anyways, it's okay to admire him.

112
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,180
Kind of like admiring a celebrity?

113
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,800
Gosh, I'm speechless.

114
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,710
There should be a limit to how much I can misunderstand.

115
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,140
Are you okay?

116
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,470
What?

117
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,980
I'm fine.

118
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,150
It's okay,

119
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,310
I can do it.

120
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,640
Just stay still.

121
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,830
You're going to catch a cold.

122
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:48,630
Done.

123
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,220
Have breakfast,

124
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,380
I already made some.

125
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,590
Sir,

126
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,630
I think I should start looking for houses.

127
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,890
Because I'm all better now.

128
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,630
I heard that herpes zoster

129
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,240
takes a month to heal completely.

130
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,870
Still, I don't think it's polite of me to keep staying here.

131
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,060
You don't need to do that,

132
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,330
not yet.

133
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,650
Whether I need to or not,

134
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,640
isn't it up to me to decide?

135
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,000
Is there something going on with you?

136
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:00,410
Oh?

137
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,740
Nothing's going on.

138
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,140
This is my first time

139
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,160
seeing you handle clay like that, what do you mean nothing's going on.

140
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:28,990
Yeah,

141
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,230
if we stay apart for a while...

142
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:48,390
Sir.

143
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,260
You're not sleeping? It's late.

144
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,230
You should go to sleep.

145
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,360
Sir.

146
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,510
When you leave for work tomorrow morning,

147
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,700
please take me, too.

148
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,940
I heard Donghee say you can go to work in the afternoon.

149
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,040
Ah... so you've heard.

150
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,480
Actually,

151
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,660
I was planning on looking for houses in the morning.

152
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,200
What about your blisters?

153
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,650
It's pretty much all healed

154
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,070
and it doesn't hurt anymore.

155
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,710
Let me see.

156
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,660
The blisters?

157
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,550
Once you leave,

158
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,960
no one will be able to check it for you.

159
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,680
That's okay.

160
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:58,440
Well,

161
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:01,750
it seems like it's all healed.

162
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,740
Ji Wonyoung.

163
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,150
Let's go,

164
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:11,840
tomorrow.

165
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,630
Let's go look for houses

166
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,830
together.

167
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,730
It's okay, you really don't have to.

168
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,280
Should... we...

169
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,320
then?

170
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,080
These days, people use apps to look for houses.

171
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:39,610
But in a rural area like this, you need a realtor.

172
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,550
All the landlords are grandmas and grandpas, of course you need one.

173
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,820
We're almost there!

174
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,030
This place is newly built so it's very clean.

175
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,410
Look at how big the window is.

176
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,040
It's great for ventilation.

177
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,960
The bathroom is here.

178
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,410
Is this place a chicken coop?

179
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,000
Look at the water pressure.

180
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,860
The water comes out well, right?

181
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,430
Realtor? -Yes~

182
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:07,580
This...

183
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,640
Will you be changing it to a new wallpaper?

184
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,940
I need to talk to you.

185
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,830
Sir,

186
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,580
why are you being like this?

187
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,060
I'm just trying to objectively evaluate

188
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,170
whether or not it's a good place.

189
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,250
If the deposit is 5 million won and monthly rent is 300 thousand won,

190
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,220
you can't expect to find a good place.

191
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,470
I'm just trying to find a place that isn't too bad,

192
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,090
but you keep nitpicking at everything.

193
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:48,740
I don't understand.

194
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,690
It's obvious that you'll be uncomfortable there.

195
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:52,880
So why?

196
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,480
Let me know if you've changed your mind.

197
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,440
I'll give you a chance.

198
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,910
To be honest, it's uncomfortable.

199
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,610
Living in someone else's house

200
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,430
doesn't suit me well.

201
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,780
Your house is so nice that I can't even move around comfortably.

202
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,349
Also, it's so far so I can't even order chicken at night

203
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,069
because they won't deliver it.

204
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,730
Getting bitten by a mosquito in the mountain also hurts more.

205
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,720
I didn't know that you were enduring so much

206
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:23,970
while staying there.

207
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:24,480
No...

208
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,819
It's not that bad...

209
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:27,760
I think it's a shame you're leaving so I expressed it,

210
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,480
but if it made you unhappy,

211
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,330
I'm sorry.

212
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,590
Sir...

213
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,570
This is Jungfrau in Switzerland.

214
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,010
We went here

215
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,650
and it was so mesmerizing.

216
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,810
Seriously, when I was there I felt...

217
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,900
Hey!

218
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,590
Pay attention!

219
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:09,260
Oh?

220
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,040
Oh.

221
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,910
Look, here and here.

222
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,960
It's so pretty, right?

223
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:15,850
I'm here, brother.

224
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,360
It seriously looked like a painting.

225
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,160
Oh, you're here.

226
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,450
One second.

227
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,610
Are you sure you're able to work?

228
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,160
Of course, I'm really okay.

229
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,810
Jooheon actually asked me to extend your break

230
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,120
but I said no

231
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,500
because starting today I need you to help with deliveries.

232
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,340
Of course I should help.

233
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,490
Have you found a place?

234
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,940
Ah...

235
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,020
it was hard to find one within my budget.

236
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,370
But thankfully the pension I used to stay at sent a text saying renovations are done,

237
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,620
so I'm going to go back there.

238
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,770
I thought you would stay at Jooheon's place for a little longer.

239
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,550
Come on,

240
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,770
I'm all better,

241
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,510
I can't just stay there shamelessly.

242
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,480
No, rather than your will,

243
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,520
I thought he would hold onto you.

244
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:03,360
Hm?

245
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:03,930
Oh?

246
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,610
It's nothing.

247
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,850
Is that the part-timer?

248
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:13,280
Yeah.

249
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:15,750
Who is she?

250
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,330
Say hi, this is Aeri from the carpentry shop.

251
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,480
Hi.

252
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,590
Hello, my name is Ji Wonyoung.

253
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:24,350
She just went on a trip for three whole months.

254
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,010
Hey, why are you saying it like it's a long time.

255
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,020
It was too short for me.

256
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,960
Wow~

257
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,350
the aura of the rich.

258
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:34,970
It's amazing, seriously.

259
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,000
Let's see each other often.

260
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,010
I'm leaving.

261
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,480
Goodbye.

262
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,710
Like Jooheon and I, she's a founding member of the Youth Mall.

263
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,920
Ah~

264
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,220
Wash it properly.

265
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,400
Oh my~ -Aunties~

266
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,280
Wonyoung is here!

267
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,810
Quince tea delivery is here! -Oh my~

268
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,200
look who it is. I heard you were sick for a while?

269
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,450
It's fine now, I'm all better.

270
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,320
Last time, when the son from the hangover soup store showed up with coffee,

271
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,480
I was so shocked.

272
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,720
Oh my, I see.

273
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,040
But Hotae isn't scary at all.

274
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,990
To be honest, that day he brought us the wrong coffee

275
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,370
so I wanted to ask him to change it for us,

276
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,510
but I was too scared to say anything so I just drank it.

277
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,310
I can't believe you're scared of someone the same age as your son.

278
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,640
Hey, it's because the rumors about him are scary.

279
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,190
They say he's a gangster and he's part of a gang.

280
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,350
Also, why does he have so many drawings on his body?

281
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:39,190
Come on~ it's all false rumors, he's not part of a gang.

282
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:43,550
It's true that he worried his mom by riding a motorcycle when he was a student,

283
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,380
but he's not the type to use his fists.

284
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,970
Really? -Also,

285
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:52,330
he quit riding after getting into a major motorcycle accident.

286
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,440
Do you not take my words seriously?

287
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,030
I warned you to never talk about this again.

288
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,070
Are you ignoring that?

289
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,180
This,

290
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,200
you know I can report you as a stalker, right?

291
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,600
Hey~ Kim Donghee. Hey~~~ let's date!!!

292
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,270
Let's just date for a month~~~!!!

293
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,620
Hey, Kim Donghee!

294
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,260
Do it.

295
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,240
Then I'll go get the CCTV from the sashimi place

296
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,070
and report you for punching me.

297
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,230
You piece of trash...

298
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,080
Why?

299
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,850
Did I say something I shouldn't say?

300
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,220
You like guys.

301
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,520
How come you're okay with others but not me?

302
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,610
You're auntie's son.

303
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:58,310
Hey,

304
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,890
do you think I'll like anyone as long as it's a guy?

305
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,510
Ugh... that's why I said it's a wish because I know you won't say yes.

306
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:08,690
Then get lost since you already know.

307
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,080
Before I tell you I will never see you again.

308
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,500
These days, I feel like my head's going to burst because of you.

309
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,410
So don't cross the line.

310
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,490
Do you not think I know how crazy this is?

311
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,240
I ended up with this conclusion after thinking about it for hundreds of times.

312
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,970
How on earth did you think to end up with this kind of conclusion?

313
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,680
I thought about why I used to always break up with my girlfriends,

314
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,510
and realized that it was because of you.

315
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,030
What?

316
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,850
Do you think you're making sense right now?

317
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,180
I don't know about the complicated stuff,

318
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,020
but I need to try dating you.

319
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,360
Can't you cooperate?

320
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,110
Nevermind.

321
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:52,990
What do I have to do to make you stop?

322
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,630
I'll do anything except for dating you. Okay?

323
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,650
Don't do anything,

324
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,590
it's all useless anyways.

325
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:03,790
Hotae,

326
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,440
let's not be like this.

327
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,160
I don't know why you're suddenly curious about this area but...

328
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:11,550
Suddenly?

329
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:16,390
Okay,

330
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,160
I guess you've hit puberty.

331
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,310
Apparently these days puberty tends to hit two, three times.

332
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,060
Can't you just hit me a few times and end this?

333
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,860
I want to look at auntie's face confidently.

334
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:38,310
Here,

335
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:39,970
hit all you want.

336
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,750
I'll take it without letting out a sound.

337
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,240
Of course,

338
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,470
there's no way you would just listen to words properly!

339
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,850
This is my last warning.

340
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,590
Wait...

341
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,910
what did I just hear..?

342
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,230
Wait so...

343
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,310
You're... you're here.

344
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:03,290
Yeah.

345
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,660
I went out to take care of something.

346
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,240
Did we receive any orders?

347
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,310
Ah... we didn't.

348
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,350
I feel like the number of orders have dropped compared to before.

349
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,900
Maybe I should announce that you're back.

350
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:24,040
Oh right, that's Jooheon's coffee, can you go bring it to him?

351
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,730
Ah...

352
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,830
If it made you unhappy,

353
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,020
I'm sorry.

354
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,010
I hope he's not mad...

355
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,930
Wait, why would he be mad?

356
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,960
Ah, this is a birdcage.

357
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,130
Why did you lock it up?

358
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,170
Because... it's cute.

359
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,570
No, you should keep it open.

360
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,180
Let it come out. -No wait, wait.

361
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,690
Hey, you should let it be free. -No.

362
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,360
Would you like it if you were locked up?

363
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,570
Gosh, seriously.

364
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,490
I'm thinking about giving up on my crush and switching to another guy.

365
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,720
You know how much I love the cute types, right?

366
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,330
How's the part-timer at Donghee's shop?

367
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,170
Sister,

368
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,940
didn't you say you have someone you like?

369
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:39,890
I don't know~

370
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,040
Hey I can't tie it, help me.

371
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,670
Gosh.

372
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,190
Come on, tie it properly.

373
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:50,360
Seriously, you just tie it up like this.

374
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:53,560
My ideal type used to be someone who's sincere and mature,

375
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:59,000
but I know for sure that this person is the opposite.

376
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:03,880
Maybe that's why

377
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,840
I always want to take care of them.

378
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,020
Just tie it up like this.

379
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:13,380
Oh?

380
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:16,950
Who was that?

381
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,720
It looked like the part-timer from Donghee's shop.

382
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,540
You should tie it yourself.

383
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,020
What's wrong?

384
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,270
Ah... um...

385
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,160
I heard that you didn't have your coffee yet today.

386
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:40,490
Thank you.

387
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,350
Sir.

388
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,570
I found a place.

389
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,930
Actually, I didn't find one,

390
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,630
I'm just going back to the pension I used to stay at.

391
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,360
That's good.

392
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,490
Um...

393
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:03,040
will you be coming home early today?

394
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:03,800
No,

395
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,300
I'm not going home today.

396
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,770
Are you really not going home?

397
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,600
You should go, I'll do the rest.

398
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,540
But why?

399
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,630
Usually you don't even come when there's work to do,

400
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,490
why are you suddenly willing to do the work for me?

401
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,110
Just go, I want to be alone.

402
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:07,280
Gosh, why are you in such a low mood today...

403
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,350
Acting up in someone else's workshop...

What are you looking at?

Ugh seriously!

00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:39,400
Just date me for a month.

00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,090
How come there isn't a single normal person in this tiny neighborhood.
