11
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,820
Sir... You're too close...

12
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:46,789
No.

13
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,150
What was that?

14
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:11,870
My bad.

15
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,920
I was making sure of something.

16
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:14,940
Making sure of what?

17
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,680
That maybe

18
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,640
you are into guys.

19
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,180
Excuse me?

20
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,110
If not then nevermind.

21
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,570
That's an absurd misunderstanding!

22
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,990
I know.

23
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,360
Sir, don't you think you owe me an apology?

24
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,600
I was

25
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,260
seriously shocked.

26
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,810
Also, what should we do about your narcissism?

27
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,770
You've been treating me like this because you think I'm into you right?

28
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,670
Right?

29
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,080
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,820
Wait!

31
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,750
Rather than an apology,

32
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,440
listen to one of my favors

33
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,880
please.

34
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:30,970
Hello.

35
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,960
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,060
You can

37
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,070
go sit at the empty seat there.

38
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:37,700
Okay.

39
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,910
Oh my, Wonyoung?

40
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:48,960
Auntie!

41
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,820
Oh right, auntie you're also taking classes right?

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,880
Wonyoung you're also interested in pottery?

43
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,440
Of course.

44
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,340
I do have interest.

45
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,380
But for that guy, not pottery.

46
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,240
Today, we are going to learn how to make a hole inside the ware we made last time.

47
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,920
Okay.

48
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,260
Ji Wonyoung, you will start with the basic lesson of using the pinching technique.

49
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,600
Teacher!

50
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,700
What is the pinching technique?

51
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,260
It's my first time here today, so I'm not sure.

52
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,200
Could you demonstrate it to me once?

53
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,290
Like this,

54
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,120
in a round shape,

55
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,710
as if you are making songpyeon.

56
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,520
You said you wanted to learn about life

57
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,850
but in pottery class,

58
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,950
we don't teach about life's philosophy.

59
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,159
I'm telling you to not get disappointed even if you don't gain anything in return.

60
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,100
Because I won't take responsibility for that.

61
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:57,970
I doubt

62
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,620
I won't gain anything in return.

63
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,140
This is such a rare opportunity.

64
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,530
Why aren't you paying attention?

65
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,860
Roundly...

66
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,160
thickness,

67
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,340
evenly.

68
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,590
Rather than watching a hundred times,

69
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,750
it's easier to understand by trying it yourself.

70
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,300
Yes, sir.

71
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,330
Wait,

72
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,970
usually I'm not this bad at using my hands.

73
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,540
Loosen your hands.

74
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,810
Don't move with the thought of making a certain shape.

75
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,990
No one is good at it

76
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:51,110
from the start.

77
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:45,730
Sir!

78
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,220
What are you doing?

79
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,230
You're going to the store, right?

80
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,659
Then could you give me a ride...

81
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,250
I'm going the opposite direction.

82
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,030
Ah...

83
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,020
have a safe trip back.

84
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,630
Come on... you could've given me a ride.

85
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,700
Is this the right way?

86
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,300
Something feels weird.

87
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,910
Wait.

88
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,150
Ah~ I've been going the opposite direction.

89
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,180
Gosh I'm so bad at directions.

90
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,310
Vice-manager Jung! I've been meaning to call you.

91
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:50,620
Ah...

92
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,280
he came here two years ago

93
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,920
so it matches the time of his disappearance

94
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,860
but he doesn't talk about his private life even with his acquaintance.

95
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,490
He only has one acquaintance, too.

96
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,130
I thought I should become close with him first

97
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,810
so I just finished taking one of Mr. Yoon's pottery classes.

98
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,090
I'll call you back...

99
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,610
Get in.

100
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,110
Sir, why are you here...

101
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,429
My plan got cancelled.

102
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,929
If you're going to the market then get in.

103
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:34,510
Really?

104
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,179
Thank you!

105
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:40,299
But

106
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,620
isn't this the opposite direction to the market?

107
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,660
Ah~ I'm in such a good mood.

108
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,820
That's dangerous.

109
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,130
I'm sorry.

110
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,450
But,

111
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,940
are there differences between the clays used in class?

112
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,120
Why?

113
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,240
I want to practice.

114
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,510
Since I'm going to learn, I want to do it properly.

115
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,240
Clay is enough.

116
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,780
I should buy some later~

117
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,540
Rather than using equipments,

118
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,740
patting the clay while getting used to its texture with your fingers

119
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,830
will help more.

120
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:44,790
Okay.

121
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:48,630
Like this,

122
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:49,770
and like this.

123
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,580
Right?

124
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,180
Wow...

125
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,000
sir I don't think your girlfriend will be able to live long.

126
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,150
I'm a guy

127
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,160
but my heart almost melted just now.

128
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:28,920
Oh?

129
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,610
What's that look on your face?

130
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,380
Sir, your narcissism is really...

131
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,560
you are handsome but,

132
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,040
I am still a guy.

133
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,820
Please don't misunderstand.

Oh?

142
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,040
Why are you two coming together?

143
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,430
No way, did you drive Wonyoung here after class?

144
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:52,790
You?

145
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,040
What is this unrealistic feeling?

146
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,590
Ah, I was the one who asked for a ride.

147
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,340
Ugh...

148
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,620
Hey! I'm here, too!

149
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,130
Sir!

150
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:17,050
I'll make sure to practice the basics before the next class!

151
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,370
Let me help you.

152
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,680
Oh no, it's okay.

153
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:27,720
It's light.

154
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,690
Oh right! I need to go to the stationary store.

155
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,290
Okay.

156
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,090
I'll be back soon!

157
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:58,840
Ugh.

158
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,710
If you move it a little bit more it might work.

159
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,870
No!

160
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,420
No, to the side..!

161
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,600
Cafe part-timer?

162
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,900
Oh it's going down.

163
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,410
I'm not really doing this to get one.

164
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,080
She should be here soon.

165
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:33,710
You can do the rest.

166
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,220
Okay~

167
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,570
Shall I loosen up my hands?

168
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,800
Hey! Go Hotae!

169
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:53,050
How dare! You! Break up! With me! You jerk!

170
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,720
Excuse me! You should talk through it instead!

171
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:56,970
Just leave her be.

172
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,860
I came out to get hit anyways.

173
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,530
What?

174
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,770
You came out to get hit? Are you really going to be like this?!

175
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,730
You jerk!

176
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,240
I said I'm fine!

177
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,490
Just go inside!

178
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,050
Ugh seriously...

179
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,410
Brother Donghee! Do you have an emergency kit here?

180
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,620
Why? Are you hurt?

181
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,870
Go Hotae! Did you hit him?

182
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,690
No, not for me it's for him.

183
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,700
He got scratched by bag chains,

184
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,880
but he won't go to the hospital.

185
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,720
Again?

186
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,490
I guess your girlfriend this time is the strong type?

187
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,970
Gosh, look at the wound...

188
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,220
Put your arm here.

189
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,900
I told you to not touch me.

190
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,390
Cover it up well.

191
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,320
Auntie will be worried.

192
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,290
I'll take care of it.

193
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,800
I'm going to go hang the laundry,

194
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,510
help him apply the medicine.

195
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,140
Brother...

196
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,610
Ah, I said it's fine.

197
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,330
Give it to me.

198
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,580
Ah!

199
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,690
Hang in there for a bit.

200
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:49,410
Shit...

201
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,150
That bastard.

202
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,410
He shouldn't appear in front of me then.

203
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:14,440
Brother,

204
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,180
are you okay?

205
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,240
I'm okay.

206
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,720
You could say this is like a quarterly event.

207
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,880
I thought maybe his relationship will last longer this time,

208
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,200
turns out it's the same as always.

209
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,380
I see...

210
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,490
Were you very shocked?

211
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,110
I'm okay.

212
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,530
But,

213
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,770
I've been wanting to ask for a while now,

214
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,670
why is the cafe's name Kanttappia?

215
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,430
My name is

216
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:40,700
Donghee,

217
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,340
so ever since I was young my nickname was Heedong.

218
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,650
Donghee, Heedong.

219
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,750
No way...

220
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,020
have you never seen Dooly?

221
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,190
No, I know Dooly but

222
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,760
isn't Kanttappia

223
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,990
the planet that Douner lives on?

224
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:13,520
I'm in shock...

225
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,490
How come no one ever told me that during the past two years?

226
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:18,410
It's okay to get confused.

227
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,180
Cha Jooheon must've known it all along, right?

228
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,819
He's probably been secretly laughing at me.

229
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,620
Ugh!

230
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,330
Let's go eat some grilled meat.

231
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:33,970
Really?

232
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,350
Then let's get some pork belly and drinks?

233
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,500
Ah, we're eating here, can't you get rid of that crap?

234
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,560
I can't,

235
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:54,820
I'm the only beginner so if I want to catch up even sleeping is a waste of time.

236
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,360
But,

237
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,830
does he not hold any exhibitions?

238
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,770
Jooheon?

239
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,880
Um...

240
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,210
Should I tell you...

241
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,570
or should I not.

242
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,970
Ugh nevermind.

243
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,070
But...

244
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,360
why do you want to know so much about Cha Jooheon?

245
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,090
Ah,

246
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,740
it's just that...

247
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,990
I admire him?

248
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,290
I want to become like him?

249
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,540
I guess you can ask him yourself.

250
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:41,300
Oh?

251
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,640
Hey! Heedong's here, too?

252
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:47,850
But,

253
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:48,850
who is this?

254
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,720
Ah, he's the part-timer at my store.

255
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,400
Say hi, this is Jooheon's upperclassman.

256
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,700
Hello, I am Ji Wonyoung.

257
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,800
Sir!

258
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,900
Hey we can eat with you guys, right? -Of course!

259
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,290
Hey! Come sit, come sit.

260
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:05,980
Let's drink.

261
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,670
Drink, drink.

262
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:11,660
Wonyoung!

263
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,880
Wonyoung,

264
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,620
what do you think about love?

265
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,840
You think that love can help you overcome any hardships, right?

266
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,780
Love is,

267
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,260
reality! Here, have a drink first

268
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,520
and give me some, too.

269
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:28,840
Me, me, me.

270
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,210
Senior, your phone's ringing.

271
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,720
Come on, stay still, I'm talking about something important here.

272
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,520
It's your wife.

273
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,280
Hello, my dear wife~

274
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,060
I picked up too late didn't I?

275
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,260
I'm trying to catch a taxi right now.

276
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,130
I'm going to leave first.

277
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,040
I caught a taxi, it's here, it's here!

278
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,100
Ah... my ears are bleeding

279
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,470
after hearing him talk about love constantly.

280
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,790
I'm going to leave, too.

281
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,400
Hey! To where!

282
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,420
We are now just getting started.

283
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,240
Wait, I'm going to go to the bathroom.

284
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,110
Have you ever seen a student as diligent as me?

285
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,720
It is pointless if you practice with a stiff clay.

286
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,180
You have to understand the sense of touch that changes slightly

287
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,900
depending on the looseness of the clay.

288
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,000
Whenever you are talking about pottery,

289
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,100
you seem to shine very brightly.

290
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,610
I'm jealous that you have something

291
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:56,840
that you love so much.

292
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,830
I don't even have a dream like that.

293
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:05,230
I just hoped to get employed and to work at the same company for the rest of my life.

294
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,750
There are people who dream of something as normal as that.

295
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,830
But sir, are you really not going to drink at all?

296
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,840
I don't really like soju.

297
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,730
Um... rather than soju...

298
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:22,700
Single malt whisky!

299
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,100
How

300
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,300
did you know?

301
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,400
Ah... um

302
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,080
you just give off this feeling

303
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,910
that you'd prefer having a glass of single malt whisky at a fancy bar.

304
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,760
I told you to fix your drunk habit because it's disgusting!

305
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,860
Is it a crime to kiss him because he's cute?!

306
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:51,560
Hey,

307
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,260
clean up and leave.

308
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,090
We should leave!

309
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,200
We have to go...

310
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,300
We have to go...

311
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,440
We have to go for a second round.

312
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,540
Wonyoung, let's go for a second round.

313
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,960
Second round? Of course!

314
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,590
Karaoke go?

315
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,730
Karaoke go!

316
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,450
Let's go to Karaoke! -Go~~~!

317
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:40,740
Where is this place?

318
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,140
I blacked out again...

319
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:53,900
Ugh what is this...

320
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,530
Where is this place?

321
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,980
Wow... what?

322
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,890
Oh? Cloud moon jar?

323
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,480
Wow... It's so cool...

324
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,230
But why is this here?

325
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,550
This is Yoon Taejoon's house?

326
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:23,220
Wow!

327
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,630
Oh my god...

328
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,490
So Cha Jooheon is an actual person.

329
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,600
Did he borrow the name?

330
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,280
Ah, sir.

331
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,500
Um...

332
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,180
Yesterday...

333
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:17,650
Do you remember anything?

334
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,510
Haha...

335
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,990
I completely blacked out...

336
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,950
Did I perhaps make any mistakes..?

337
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,250
You dance,

338
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,270
really well.

339
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,900
Ah~ haha...

340
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,960
I'm sorry.

341
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,950
It's been a while

342
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,930
since I saw something so bizarre.

343
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,130
Can you go bring some cutlery and bowls from the back?

344
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,050
Ah, sure!

345
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,890
Did you go out to buy breakfast?

346
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,360
I bought it on my way back from the workshop.

347
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,290
The workshop?

348
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,140
It's only 8 A.M.

349
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,380
There was something I needed to do.

350
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,920
I had to take care of someone who was drunk

351
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,380
so I couldn't get anything done.

352
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,400
That's so cool.

353
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,760
Working at dawn is not an easy thing to do.

354
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,460
Oh? Sir, your neck...

355
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,960
I'm sorry.

356
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:50,390
It looks like a stain from clay so I was going to wipe it off.

357
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,210
Ugh... my stomach feels sick...

358
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,070
What?

359
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,280
What happened?

360
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,900
Ah, I'll do it.

361
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,130
Did I make a fuss about wanting to come here yesterday?

362
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,440
Ah... um

363
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,260
I also blacked out...

364
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,030
No way...

365
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,030
Cha Jooheon did you bring us here?

366
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,500
Should I have left you guys there?

367
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,920
What's this?

368
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,080
Hangover soup?

369
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,210
He said he bought it on his way back from the workshop.

370
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,520
You keep doing things that you don't usually do.

371
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:49,740
Oh!

372
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,440
You bought the Dooly one!

373
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,550
Then I should eat a lot~

374
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,240
You're here?

375
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,730
Where's the clay?

376
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,700
It came, it's here.

377
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:33,590
Dude, if you saw me you should say hi first.

378
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,140
That's unexpected of you.

379
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:39,110
You should live without expectations, that way it's more fun.

380
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,630
Are you sure this is from Gangwon-do?

381
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,160
It doesn't seem like it is.

382
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,370
Are you not going to help?

383
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,870
God...

384
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,180
What is this?

385
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,020
Student's works.

386
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:09,000
Dude, just bake these in an electric kiln. There isn't even much of a difference.

387
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,800
Ugh... I'm doing all the hard work while you're taking the credit.

388
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,720
What, are you putting that in, too?

389
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,970
A new student made it.

390
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,560
Ah~

391
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,810
he's doing well from his first work.

392
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,080
It's a heart!

393
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,560
Drink some first.

394
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,280
Thank you.

395
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,640
Are you not going to start working on your piece?

396
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,570
You've rested enough. You should slowly...

397
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,570
I'm already doing it.

398
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,200
Hey, is making and selling bowls considered working on your piece?

399
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,120
You've lost the mindset you started with.

400
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,930
Do you not remember what our professor said?

401
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,270
"As long as you don't let go of clay in your hands it's fine".

402
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,570
This has nothing to do with mindset.

403
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,440
It's because I want to see it, me!

404
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,890
What's with you, being so itchy.

405
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,610
Is it itchy? Where?

406
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:23,830
Here? I'll scratch it for you.

407
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,110
Last week I went to Seoul because of an exhibition,

408
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,590
and I don't know why but everyone keeps asking me about you.

409
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,450
You're still really popular.

410
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,450
Let's stop.

411
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,480
Painter Yoon Seongguk also went to the exhibition.

412
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:48,150
He said he could tell that I knew where you were,

413
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,250
and scolded me for lying to him.

414
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,120
Hey,

415
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,220
you really should go and meet him.

416
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,350
Even if he is harsh when he talks,

417
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,040
you're his only son, there's no way that he doesn't miss you.

418
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,570
Senior.

419
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,130
Watch the fire,

420
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,210
I'm going to go home real quick then come back.

421
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,660
Ow! This is exhausting.

422
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,380
Do we have anything?

423
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,150
Do your work first.

424
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:33,810
Ow my back hurts. Is there anything cold to drink?

425
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:36,340
Wait, wait and see.

426
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,890
Will something come out if I wait?

427
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,450
Coffee delivery!

428
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,420
This! Haha!

429
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,050
You work so diligently!

430
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,030
Oh my~ I've never seen you before.

431
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:50,590
You're so pretty, like a shaved chestnut.

432
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,380
Thank you.

433
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,700
Oh, so bitter.

434
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,810
It's so bitter.

435
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:57,420
I'll add a lot of syrup to your's next time auntie.

436
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,370
Put in a spoonful.

437
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,010
Okay, I will.

438
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,340
I don't need any syrup.

439
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:00,670
Okay.

440
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,660
So tacky~

441
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,840
Oh..! Is it a fly?

442
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:18,450
Goodness. Did you skip the academy again?!

443
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,670
Ah! It hurts!

444
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:21,610
Shut up!

445
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,780
Ah, you caught him!

446
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,710
This... this...

447
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:29,560
he didn't graduate from school so he's attending a GED academy but will he succeed if he keeps acting like this?

448
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,920
Why don't you just broadcast it to the whole market?

449
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,720
Shut up!

450
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,020
Go inside!

451
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,850
Stop it, stop.

452
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,960
Goodness, at least he looks normal.

453
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:45,810
Hey, Wonyoung,

454
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,730
didn't you graduate from a prestigious university in Seoul?

455
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,580
Can you help our Hotae...

456
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,480
Hello?

457
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,040
What's your name?

458
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:04,750
What are you doing?

459
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:06,770
Oh, you're here?

460
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,100
I want extra shots. -I knew you'd come.

461
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,850
I'm a bit late, right?

462
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:15,590
Sir.

463
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,340
Is something wrong?

464
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:24,850
Ah...

465
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,280
it's just that...

466
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,880
the auntie from the hangover soup restaurant

467
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,130
asked me to tutor Hotae.

468
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,230
Tutor Hotae?

469
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:36,730
Hey,

470
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,780
that's not okay!

471
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:40,610
You are my part-timer whom I rightfully hired.

472
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,920
Wow, Dooly auntie has crossed the line.

473
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,110
This won't do,

474
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,120
you can have this after adding syrup!

475
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:47,910
But,

476
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,430
she said she will take care of

477
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,050
200,000 won worth of coffee delivery sales per day.

478
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,930
Deal! -Brother!

479
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,580
Hey, Hotae only looks scary on the outside,

480
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,080
but once you get to know him he's super kind and innocent.

481
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,440
Once you get to know him, his tattoos here and there...

482
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,290
Hey, that's prejudice.

483
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,250
On top of that, I am number one in the country when it comes to giving bonus' to part-timers.

484
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:24,890
Right?

485
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,610
Really?

486
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:28,930
I'll do it!

487
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,870
Yes!

488
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:43,810
Brother,

489
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,120
I'll go hang the laundry then come back.

490
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,110
Sure, go ahead.

491
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:47,700
Okay!

492
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,360
Vice-manager Jung.

493
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:06,580
I'm sorry.

494
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,850
Mr. Yoon was next to me earlier.

495
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,270
Hm, I see.

496
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,420
Is there any progress so far?

497
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,679
Um...

498
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:19,560
we seem to have gotten closer.

499
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,050
I've been to his house once

500
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,170
and we even drank alcohol together.

501
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:24,889
Oh, that's good.

502
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,909
Then what about his plans on returning to work?

503
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,650
Did you find out about anything special?

504
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,060
Not yet...

505
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,510
I haven't gotten that far.

506
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:33,460
Hm...

507
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:35,420
I see.

508
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:40,139
Well, gaining Mr. Yoon's trust is the priority

509
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,800
so I'm guessing you need more time.

510
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,300
Anyways,

511
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:46,040
you have to make Mr. Yoon

512
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,310
open his heart completely to you.

513
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:49,870
Understand?

514
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:50,420
Yes.

515
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,210
So,

516
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,220
I'll really get reinstated, right?

517
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,640
Come on,

518
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,740
I told you to trust me.

519
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,010
The most important thing right now

520
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:11,260
is for you to gain a spot in Mr. Yoon's heart.

521
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,540
Ji Wonyoung.
