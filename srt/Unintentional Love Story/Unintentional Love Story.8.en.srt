This is so...

12
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:45,600
Actually,

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,200
I found out that you were staying here

14
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,130
through Wonyoung.

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,830
How do you guys know each other?

16
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:54,860
Um...

17
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,530
Wonyoung was an employee for our General Affairs Team at Taepyeong.

18
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,230
He's been suspended due to some problems

19
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,289
but before that the chairman ordered him to search for you so he's been working on that.

20
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,940
So you're saying that he knew what I looked like.

21
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:14,740
Yes.

22
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,060
But at the time

23
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,930
everyone was going crazy trying to find you.

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,010
Of course, as you already know, our chairman

25
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,630
is also not the type to sit still.

26
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:25,730
So you're saying that

27
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,640
it's already been a while since Ji Wonyoung

28
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,340
told you about me.

29
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,660
Yes, that's right.

30
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,900
It was

31
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,690
around the time when he got suspended.

32
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,350
Ah,

33
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,380
he came to Gangneung to take a break

34
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,140
and told me he found you by chance.

35
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:51,789
After a while,

36
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,680
he contacted me and asked

37
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,050
whether or not he’ll get his job back

38
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,509
if he manages to persuade you

39
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,820
to sign an exclusive contract.

(Part 8)

41
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,660
He contacted me and asked

42
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,630
whether or not he’ll get his job back if he manages to persuade you

43
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,170
to sign an exclusive contract.

44
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,090
He's coming back late.

45
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,440
Why did I leave my phone there...

46
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,079
Who is it?

47
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,579
It's me.

48
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,510
Sir?

49
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,460
Did you come up because I don't have my phone?

50
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,090
Come on in.

51
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,480
Ah, it's a mess, right?

52
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,660
Sir.

53
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,640
It's finally back.

54
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,180
It's so inconvenient without it.

55
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,550
I couldn't even contact you.

56
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,600
Are you preparing for a job?

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,140
Ah, yes.

58
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,290
I was looking at companies that are recruiting during the first half of next year.

59
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,390
Are you not interested in Taepyeong?

60
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,920
It's also a big company.

61
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,490
Ah, um

62
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,340
there aren't any spots left there.

63
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,330
I wonder if they'll be recruiting during the second half of the year.

64
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,340
I actually have some connections with them.

65
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,560
Inside Taepyeong's gallery,

66
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,670
I have my own exhibition hall.

67
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:53,930
What do you think?

68
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,400
Should I ask

69
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,410
someone I know

70
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,050
to help get you a job?

71
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,770
It's okay.

72
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,830
It's my job so I should get it on my own.

73
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:10,790
I see.

74
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,960
On

75
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,250
your own.

76
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:24,670
I'll go now.

77
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,910
You're leaving right away?

78
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,190
Sir,

79
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,280
is something wrong?

80
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,460
Rest well.

81
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,450
You could've stayed longer...

82
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,110
Sir.

83
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,790
Vice-manager Jung told me everything.

84
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,970
Everything about why you stuck around me.

85
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,370
I found out because

86
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,110
he came to my workshop.

87
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,820
How long did you plan on fooling me till?

88
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,560
Sir. -But even so!

89
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,990
If you confessed now,

90
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,300
I was going to think about it.

91
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,610
I thought maybe you had your own reasons for not telling me.

92
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,360
I also thought this might be why

93
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,500
you were having such a hard time that day in Seoul.

94
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,330
But in the end,

95
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,730
you chose your company.

96
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,530
Back then,

97
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:36,770
and right now.

98
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,720
No!

99
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,330
It's not that.

100
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,450
It's because I was scared.

101
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,659
I thought you'll break up with me if I told you everything.

102
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,810
I was scared of breaking up with you.

103
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,090
I bet.

104
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,409
Because if we break up your plan will fail.

105
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:53,100
What...

106
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,520
Were you happy you got the opportunity

107
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,900
because I fell for you faster than you expected?

108
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,900
I've never thought of it like that.

109
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,450
I've never thought of it as an opportunity.

110
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,300
You're lying again.

111
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,170
I'm not lying, I really...

112
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,490
You're telling me to believe that?

113
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:04,810
Sir.

114
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,530
I no longer know

115
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,790
which is part of your plan

116
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,730
and which is the truth.

117
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,090
I don't know.

118
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,960
Sir.

119
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:47,530
Ji Wonyoung,

120
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,140
let's never see each other again.

121
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,690
What are you doing?

122
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,380
Ah, brother.

123
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,600
You're the part-timer at my shop not here, okay?

124
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,130
If you came to work you should say hi to me first.

125
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,270
What's wrong?

126
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,740
What's with your face?

127
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,800
Is he

128
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,360
not coming to work?

129
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,490
Why are you asking me?

130
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,930
He did tell me that he won't be coming to work for a few days.

131
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,300
I feel like he underestimates the self-employed.

132
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,920
Is it because he's rich?

133
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,250
Brother.

134
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,060
Can I

135
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,130
get off work a bit earlier today?

136
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,960
Sure.

137
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,880
Thank you.

138
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,670
Sir! Sir!

139
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,420
Sir!

140
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,980
I made a desk lamp. -Desk lamp?

141
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,890
But I'm not going to give it to you. -Oh?

142
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,100
Why? -I'll put it in the room you used before

143
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,960
so if you want to see it

144
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,350
come back.

145
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,940
He finally came to work.

146
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,690
Wow... he skipped work for three days.

147
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,070
Brother, I'll be right back.

148
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,020
Sir. -Did you

149
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,780
not understand what I said?

150
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,720
I said let's not see each other again.

151
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,220
Please listen to what I have to say, too.

152
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,890
It's all my fault.

153
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,410
It's true that I intentionally

154
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,250
approached you

155
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,820
and it's my fault for

156
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,660
not telling you this sooner.

157
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,350
I really shouldn't have done that,

158
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,470
and you might think I'm making excuses,

159
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,250
but I never once thought

160
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,180
that the kindness you showed me

161
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,030
was an opportunity.

162
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,850
Because falling for you

163
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,940
was not part of the plan.

164
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,170
My sincerity... -You're too greedy.

165
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,820
Since you can't go back to work right now,

166
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,340
are you now planning to stay by my side

167
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,550
as you wait

168
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,310
for an opportunity?

169
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,850
Sir. -Stop acting.

170
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,110
You'll get

171
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,100
what you want.

172
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,610
What do you mean?

173
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,380
Take it.

174
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,740
It seems like it's vice-manager Jung.

175
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,390
Hello? -Wonyoung?

176
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:20,670
Ah,

177
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,140
the General Affairs Team didn't contact you yet, right?

178
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,680
This is a big news.

179
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,900
You can come back to work

180
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,260
starting from the day after tomorrow.

181
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,460
Mr. Yoon

182
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,540
decided to

183
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,620
sign an exclusive contract with our company.

184
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,080
Haha, this is all thanks to you.

185
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,690
Mr. Yoon

186
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,860
even personally came to the company

187
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,150
to ask us to give you your job back.

188
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,560
Haha.

189
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,380
Sir!

190
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,340
What I want is... -Go back to the company.

191
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,150
This is the last kindness

192
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,780
and punishment I'm giving you.

193
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,780
I hope that

194
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,080
you feel guilty.

195
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,860
Do you want to just leave, or should I hit you first?

196
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,450
If you agree to date me for a month,

197
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,370
I'll leave right away.

198
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,500
I told you to leave. -Gosh,

199
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,040
how many times has it been?

200
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,490
Hey, what's wrong?

201
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,380
Are you okay?

202
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,420
What's wrong, part-timer?

203
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:07,869
Did you two,

204
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,910
fight? -Wonyoung,

205
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,140
what's wrong?

206
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:14,829
Cha Jooheon did this, right?

207
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,230
Ugh.

208
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,079
What did he say?

209
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,060
Seriously,

210
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,630
what did he say to you?

211
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:28,660
This won't do.

212
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,860
No,

213
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,610
I'm the one who's wrong.

214
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,400
I lied to him.

215
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,670
Did he go to work today?

216
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,170
Is he eating properly?

217
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,850
Is he okay?

218
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,880
Hello?

219
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,400
Ah, the gukbap restaurant?

220
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,580
Two iced-americanos

221
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,500
and two lattes?

222
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,470
Okay.

223
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,440
Fruit shop delivery, done!

224
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,590
Gosh, you scared me.

225
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,740
The coffee beans will arrive later so go receive it.

226
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,090
Sure, if you date me for a month.

227
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,050
Are you not going to leave?

228
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,380
I left.

229
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,360
Since the Earth is spinning,

230
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,150
are you spinning too? (an expression for going crazy)

231
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,880
Yes.

232
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,070
I feel better now after seeing you laugh.

233
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,160
You know,

234
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,680
you get mad because of me,

235
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:38,830
and laugh because of me,

236
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,930
but yet you still say you're not interested in me.

237
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:48,690
Yes, sir.

238
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,480
I'm going to go and receive the coffee beans.

239
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,580
One cinnamon latte.

240
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,110
I see you're still mad. -Oh my~

241
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,430
Mr. Yoon Taejoon,

242
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,470
do I even have the right to be mad?

243
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,200
It's just that the wound from

244
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,820
getting betrayed by a friend I trusted still stings.

245
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,570
I told you I had a reason.

246
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,850
I'm sorry. -What about Wonyoung?

247
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,330
Don't you think he also has his reasons?

248
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,990
He had already resigned from his job.

249
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,270
If he was searching for an opportunity to get his job back,

250
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,770
why would he resign?

251
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,050
I'm going to leave if you're not going to make me my coffee.

252
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,860
Just go, you cheapskate.

253
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,320
Bye.

254
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:03,770
Hey, hey, hey!

255
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:05,900
Are you really leaving just because I told you to?

256
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,040
Wait.

257
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,510
I can tell how sincere he is

258
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,140
just by the look on his face.

259
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:16,920
Why are you trying to ignore that?

260
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,800
If this was the first time,

261
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,260
then I'll probably believe him.

262
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,040
But trust is something that can be broken

263
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,500
even after dating for five years.

264
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:38,970
It's only been

265
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,620
two, three months.

266
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,590
Taejoon.

267
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,830
Do you think that without your father,

268
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,460
you'll be of any use to me?

269
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,440
This is Wonyoung's.

270
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,230
Since he's not coming anymore,

271
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,060
should I clean it up?

272
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:09,810
If you leave it there,

273
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,490
I'll take care of it.

274
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,720
Then I'll leave it here.

275
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,120
Teacher!

276
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:34,550
Help me look at this!

277
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,590
I can't seem to do this part well.

278
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:37,850
Ji Wonyoung.

279
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,170
How come

280
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,540
you can't even

281
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,310
do the basics properly?

282
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,180
You've already taken so many classes.

283
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,580
Ugh... you were joking, right?

284
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,250
I'm not doing this.

285
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,780
Hello?

286
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,480
What is this?

287
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,370
I can tell how hopeless you feel just by your voice.

288
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,190
Donghee brother?

289
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,790
Yeah, I'm in front of your house.

290
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,910
In front of my house?

291
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,910
Yeah, hurry and come out.

292
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:20,790
Ha~

293
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:23,910
Are you not going to drink?

294
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:26,490
Ah...

295
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,500
If you're here, what about the cafe?

296
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,600
I left it with Go Hotae.

297
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,800
He's even doing the deliveries. -Ah...

298
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,430
I was supposed to

299
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:38,990
help Hotae study

300
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,380
until he takes the GED.

301
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,350
I feel sorry.

302
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,730
Oh my~ you're sorry about so many things.

303
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:45,630
You don't need to feel sorry towards him.

304
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,420
It seems like

305
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,480
he got inspired,

306
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,270
because he's

307
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,350
taking studying seriously now.

308
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,140
After all, he's someone who does anything he sets his mind to.

309
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:58,900
That's good to hear.

310
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:00,870
Jooheon,

311
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:02,970
no I mean,

312
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,410
Taejoon's shop,

313
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,440
always has visitors coming from Seoul.

314
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,550
So now it really feels like

315
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,640
he's a famous person.

316
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,740
It also feels kind of weird.

317
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:22,210
What about you?

318
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,140
Are you eating properly?

319
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,030
I'm eating properly. -Ah~

320
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,060
you're lying again.

321
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,400
Just look at you,

322
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,670
you look like you could die tomorrow.

323
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,840
Ha...

324
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:39,930
What about work?

325
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,170
It's already been a week

326
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,440
and you didn't show up at all.

327
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,110
Are they still waiting for you?

328
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,970
If I go to work,

329
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,570
that means I'm admitting that

330
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,970
I sold him to get my job back

331
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,560
and that I'm someone

332
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:58,470
who used him.

333
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,550
But,

334
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:08,410
I miss him

335
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,510
so much.

336
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:15,310
Go back to work.

337
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,470
Isn't this an opportunity

338
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,990
that you got because Yoon Taejoon signed an exclusive contract?

339
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,400
Are you just going to waste it like this?

340
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,920
Since you're under the same company, who knows?

341
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,750
Maybe you'll run into him by chance.

342
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,840
Everyone, let's not be

343
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,340
too obvious. -Yeah,

344
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,120
it's not confirmed yet.

345
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,120
He didn't have any connections in the past,

346
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,960
how does he have one now?

347
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,740
Then how do you explain how he

348
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,290
got his job back? -Yeah,

349
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,290
the investigation on manager Kim

350
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,310
hasn't even ended yet.

351
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,570
It's weird no matter how you think about it.

352
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,510
Everyone, Wonyoung is back.

353
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,270
Wonyoung, you can sit here.

354
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,280
Let's work hard.

355
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,940
Oh? Wonyoung you're here.

356
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:44,830
Congratulations on your reinstatement.

357
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,960
Who can work overtime today?

358
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,450
I need two people. -What's going on?

359
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,550
Please don't do this,

360
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,960
it's Friday today, team manager.

361
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,300
The gallery

362
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,590
suddenly asked for help.

363
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,550
Team manager, is something wrong there?

364
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,940
The ceramist

365
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,780
that signed an exclusive contract lately

366
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,180
has a photoshoot today,

367
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,210
but the Management Team says they don't have enough people.

368
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:09,890
You know, our chairman's favorite.

369
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,470
Ah,

370
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,430
Mr. Yoon Taejoon.

371
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,750
I'll go. -Huh?

372
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:18,890
Me too.

373
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:41,080
Oh? Mr. Yoon you're here. -Hello.

374
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,510
Mr. Yoon is here.

375
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,860
Stop looking around

376
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,360
and let's finish our work quickly.

377
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,690
I need to go to the bathroom.

378
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,650
So the person coming from the head office to help

379
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,380
is you.

380
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,410
This contract

381
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,710
is all thanks to you.

382
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:43,900
But

383
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,370
seeing you here like this

384
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,940
makes me sad.

385
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:48,410
Well,

386
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,510
did you say hello to Mr. Yoon?

387
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,600
You promised me

388
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:52,690
that you wouldn't say anything.

389
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,080
I was really shocked, too.

390
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,290
I wanted to keep the promise,

391
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,010
so I called you first.

392
00:28:59,300 --> 00:28:59,650
How was I supposed to know

393
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,150
that Mr. Yoon was going to pick up?

394
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,480
But the fact that you went there...

395
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,410
The result is good, so what's the problem?

396
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,860
We signed a contract with Mr. Yoon,

397
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:09,070
and you got your job back.

398
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:10,220
Also, it's normal

399
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,200
for relationships to go back and forth

400
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,040
from good and bad.

401
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:13,960
Just wait a bit,

402
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,580
I'll make sure to

403
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,660
have a talk with Mr. Yoon

404
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,640
in the future.

405
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:20,330
Work hard.

406
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,650
Hello.

407
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,520
Wow, this...

408
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,120
this is so good.

409
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,420
Can we take a photo?

410
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,080
Who can I blame?

411
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,330
It's all my fault.

412
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,880
Is there anyone else

413
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,410
besides Mr. Yoon doing the photoshoot today?

414
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,350
Yeah, right after Mr. Yoon's photoshoot.

415
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,320
His name is Mr. Choi Inho.

416
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,260
Assistant manager Park, I'm really sorry.

417
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,550
Oh? Wonyoung!

418
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:13,990
Where are you going?

419
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,700
Mr. Choi, you're here.

420
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,930
It's busy here today, too.

421
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,320
It's because Mr. Yoon is here.

422
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,240
Is he inside?

423
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:19,630
Yes.

424
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:21,340
He's probably resting in the waiting room.

425
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,220
Taejoon.

426
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:07,710
What?

427
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,860
He's not here.

428
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:26,650
I'm sorry.

429
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,260
One person

430
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,050
hurting him is enough.

431
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,220
Come in.

432
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,580
Sir.

433
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,280
I came to help with work.

434
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,170
Though I really came because you're here.

435
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,790
Go. -Let's talk,

436
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,500
for a bit.

437
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,760
It won't take long.

438
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,380
I'm

439
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,180
being punished like the way you said.

440
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,380
I knew I shouldn't

441
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,580
have come back,

442
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,180
but if I didn't

443
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,690
I might not be able to see you again.

444
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,930
I'm really going to give it my all

445
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,240
until you forgive me.

446
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,190
Whether it's trying or something else,

447
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,840
don't do it.

448
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,520
Forgiveness

449
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,200
is something you do when there are still feelings left.

450
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:02,020
I no longer have

451
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,190
any feelings for you.

452
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,050
I'd be lying if I said

453
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:07,940
I wasn't mad,

454
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,620
but I've decided to try to understand.

455
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,930
That's what I'm doing right now.

456
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,780
Even right now,

457
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,560
I am trying to understand why

458
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,030
you are looking at me with lingering feelings,

459
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:26,130
and whether if

460
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,250
you still have things

461
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,850
that you need to use me for.

462
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,400
Leave.

463
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:42,970
I'm going to rest.

464
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:50,489
Ah!

465
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,389
Seriously, no matter how I think about it

466
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:55,449
I feel so wronged.

467
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,880
Right?

468
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:14,810
Haha.

469
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,770
It's so nice because Wonyoung is here.

470
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,720
I'm sorry I left without saying goodbye.

471
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,210
You left because you got into a big company,

472
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,400
why should you apologize?

473
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,350
I'm so happy.

474
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,240
So proud.

475
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,320
Oh? Teacher~ -Oh my, teacher!

476
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,980
Teacher's here. -Oh, he's here.

477
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,520
Welcome!

478
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:33,990
Haha.

479
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,940
What are you trying to do?

480
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,410
I know it's crazy,

481
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,390
but I feel like I had to do this

482
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,090
in order to

483
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:46,800
see you.

484
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,880
You're so annoying.

485
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,440
I told you we're over.

486
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,120
Do you not understand my words?

487
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,000
Because the way you're thinking

488
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,660
makes me feel so wronged.

489
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,050
The way I'm thinking? -Even if we're over,

490
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,070
I want to solve this misunderstanding.

491
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,510
If you're mad because

492
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,430
I fooled you,

493
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,540
then it's okay,

494
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,390
I understand.

495
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,440
But,

496
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,290
if you're mad

497
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,130
and can't forgive me because

498
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,090
you think I stuck by you while pretending to like you,

499
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,400
then I feel

500
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,840
really wronged.

501
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:23,890
I'll do anything.

502
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,930
If I can prove to you that my feelings are sincere,

503
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,390
I'll kneel down if you tell me to

504
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,270
and beg if you tell me to.

505
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,090
If doing so will make you feel it...

506
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:32,890
Why?

507
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:33,970
Why do I

508
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:34,530
have to know

509
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,620
how you feel?

510
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,570
Because that's the truth.

511
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,390
I know what I did was wrong,

512
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,930
but sir,

513
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,340
you have no right to

514
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,850
judge how I feel based on your own thoughts.

515
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,400
Because that makes me feel so wronged.

516
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,320
Don't ignore me

517
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,640
and don't go interpreting everything in your own way.

518
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,480
Sir,

519
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:24,730
I'll leave.

520
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,230
You're the main character of this gathering.

521
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,060
Thank you.

522
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,800
Teacher!

523
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,190
Where's Wonyoung?

524
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,530
I was worried that he'll be cold so I brought this with me.

525
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,020
Where did he go?

526
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,420
Oh?

527
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,130
♫ It still feels unfamiliar ♫

528
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,980
Someone told me to give this to you.

529
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:04,930
Ah,

530
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,580
thank you.

531
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,960
Sir!

532
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:26,730
You don't need to turn around!

533
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,450
Please just listen to me!

534
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,390
I'll think about it more!

535
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,990
A lot more!

536
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:34,960
On what I need to do

537
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,810
for you to believe me!

538
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,220
I'll think about it more!

539
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,520
A lot more!

540
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,790
I'll think about what I need to do for you to believe me!

541
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,720
I can't give up on you!

542
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,190
I can't give up!

543
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,190
I thinking about

544
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,380
adding pottery class to the general electives.

545
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,330
I guess I don't need to think about it much.

546
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,240
See, he's saying he won't do it.

547
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:21,860
Or,

548
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,320
is he starting to give up? -Ah! I'll go.

549
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:26,860
I'll go, I'll go.

550
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,010
Ji Wonyoung, are you hurt? Are you okay?

551
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,480
I thought I'd be fine if I didn't see you around,

552
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,920
but I wasn't okay.

553
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,550
I thought I was crazy.

554
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:35,570
Ji Wonyoung.

555
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,040
Why did you not pick up?

556
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,270
Taejoon, let go of the past. -Just now,

557
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:42,650
what did

558
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,390
you say?
