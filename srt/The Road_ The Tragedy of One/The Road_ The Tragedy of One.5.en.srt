167
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,630
He came here to examine
the building beforehand

168
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,830
or he already knew the structure.

169
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,930
Where's the last location
of the navigation?

170
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,500
What are you hiding until the end?

171
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,010
It's nothing to do with the case.

172
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,610
I will be the judge of it.
You were at a murder scene.

173
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,480
At the house of a victim,
you said you hadn't heard from.

174
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,220
By the rules, you're the first suspect.
Do you know that?

175
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,920
If you're suspicious of me, you can
investigate me. I'll cooperate.

176
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,250
That's not what I mean!

177
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,660
You and I, aren't we working together?
We're supposed to cooperate, aren't we?

178
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,430
Those who blackmail have a clear purpose.

179
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,359
Money or reinstatement.
They only have one goal.

180
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,740
But why did the guy who asked
for his reinstatement to you and Ms. Cha

181
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,200
go to Chairman Seo?

182
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,140
He has nothing to do
with his reinstatement.

183
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,680
Unless there's something else hidden.

184
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,780
"Something else hidden."

185
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,850
That's why you're more suspicious.

186
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,420
Whenever you hide something,
we find a dead body.

187
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,520

There's something we should talk about.

198
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,730
What did you discuss with Park Sung-hwan?

199
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,170
What are you going to investigate
with that unerring instinct of yours?

200

Let's not do this to each other now.

I will tell you earnestly.

In exchange,

204
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:11,280
move my interview up a day.

205
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,350
Why?

206
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,520
It's a murder case of a current reporter.

207
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,320
The drug case will be reported
tomorrow as well.

208
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,150
The allegation about the kidnap case

209
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,990
you've been reporting and the follow-up
news of the slush fund will be out too.

210
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,530
By that time, I will be forgotten.

211
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,290
You don't want your thunder stolen?

212
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,860
I'm too young to stay in the shadow.

213
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,670
Moreover,

214
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,300
if I'm forgotten, Joon-young is forgotten.

215
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,170
I'll do that.

216
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:44,950
That was too easy.

217
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,880
It's my turn. Tell me everything you know.

218
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,980
The reason Park Sung-hwan
wants to meet Chairman Seo.

219
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,290
I don't know the details either.

220
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,720
I saw him blackmailing with the dashcam
but I didn't watch the footage.

221
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
But

222
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,960
he was confident that
Chairman Seo will give him a position

223
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,100
even if he has to buy the broadcasting
company after watching the footage.

224
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,740
The face of the culprit.

225
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,080
There's something more than that.

226
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,350
I heard Park Sung-hwan
stayed at Royal The Hill that day.

227
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,890
What the culprit has could be something
more dangerous than the original.

228
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,620
For example,
Chairman Seo's dirty old secret.

229
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,190
And Park Sung-hwan filmed it by chance.

230
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,640
Remember when we were on the same team?

231
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,470
This reminds me of that time.

234
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,150
Joon-young's third-day memorial service
is tomorrow.

235
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,090
I know.

236
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,360
When you found out
that it was Joon-young, not Yeon-woo,

237
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,630
how did you feel?

Don't ask such a ridiculous question.

239
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,940
Were you relieved?

240
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,770
Thinking everything
would be swept under the rug?

241
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,690

You'll get nothing out of it.

in this situation?
