00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:53,230
[But then the moment]

499
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:57,200
[you said you loved me
with an innocent look, I realized]

500
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:01,400
[how cruel and heavy the truth can be.]

501
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:06,540
[I'm not the kind of person
you think I am.]

502
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,310
[I must stand before you as a lie
even until the last moment.]

503
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,710
[I waited a long time for you to love me,]

504
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:18,780
[but I don't deserve it.]

505
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:21,590
[I'm sorry,]

506
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,020
[Soo-hyun.]

507
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:29,360
No.

508
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,030
No, it can't be.

509
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,130
No.

510
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:30,820
[The world in a snow globe
does not change.]

511
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,490
[It's always beautiful,]

512
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:35,660
[and it's always full of happiness.]

513
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:40,470
[I wanted to become
that kind of mother and wife.]

514
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,530
Yeon-woo.

515
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:43,970
You really didn't know?

516
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:45,800
What?

517
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,740
I don't want to hear it, so just leave.

518
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:49,910
You also know

519
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,880
that your dad

520
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:54,950
is my biological dad.

521
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,250
Stop it! I don't want to hear it!

522
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,290
Yeon-woo.

523
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:07,160
Yeon-woo.

524
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,900
Joon-young, what were you talking about?

525
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,330
Who told you that?

526
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:18,140
Everyone knows.

527
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:21,240
I bet Yeon-woo knows it too.

528
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:24,910
Say it's not true.

529
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:27,310
Mom.

530
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:29,380
Say it!

531
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,480
Wait...

532
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,250
You're mistaken.

533
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,360
You know it too.

534
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,170
That's why you always give me that look.

535
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:52,570
-That pity in your eyes...
-Please!

536
00:51:58,610 --> 00:51:59,880
You should go home.

537
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:03,450
Why should I leave?

538
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:05,580
This is my dad's home.

539
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:09,690
Don't do this, Joon-young.

540
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,860
Then tell Yeon-woo to leave too.

541
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:15,760
He's not your son anyway.

542
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:33,850
No.

543
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,150
Yeon-woo is my son.

544
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,890
-He's my son.
-You...

545
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:44,120
You're just the same.

546
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:46,890
Mom...

547
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:50,130
Please leave.

548
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:53,830
I won't.

549
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,130
I won't leave.

550
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,840
I'll stay here until I die!

551
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,540
Please stop it!

552
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,310
[But at that moment,]

553
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:12,880
[I saw my true face.]

554
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:18,660
[My old and dark face.]

555
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:25,730
Hello.

556
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:32,440
[If he were to disappear,]

557
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:35,540
[the world in the snow globe]

558
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:38,540
[would stay beautiful forever.]

559
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,910
[My other face whispered it to me.]

560
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,710
[Just like that, an innocent boy]

561
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:12,640
[died.]

562
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:44,110
Eun-soo.

563
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:48,980
Oh, no. What do I do?

564
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:50,750
Yeon-woo.

565
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,020
It's okay.

566
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,530
Take your time and take slow breaths.

567
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,700
Take your time.

568
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:09,530
One more time. Slowly.

569
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,140
There you go. Slowly.

570
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,640
That's it. Breathe slowly.

571
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:16,440
There you go. One more time.
Take your time.

572
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,020
There you go.

573
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:32,060
Yeon-woo calmed down now. Tell me.

574
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,590
What happened?

575
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:37,460
Joon-young fell

576
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:42,100
by accident. No.

577
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:46,640
I think I killed him.

578
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:48,540
Leave it to me.

579
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,440
I...

580
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:55,710
will save you.

581
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:58,680
[If you think it's okay, it becomes okay.]

582
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:02,020
[If you think nothing happened,
it becomes nothing.]

583
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:04,020
[I prayed hundreds of times,]

584
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:06,320
[but it was no use.]

585
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:11,900
[My dark, worn-out face
is disgusting, evil,]

586
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,370
[and even bloody.]

587
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:25,940
[The room where I exchanged my sin]

588
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:29,080
[with an innocent child.]

589
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,560
I'll do the rest.

590
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:10,790
Just remember.

591
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,160
That you're Yeon-woo's mom.

592
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:28,940
[The sin that can't be forgiven,]

593
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:33,110
[which makes me not worthy of redemption.]

594
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:52,730
[And...]

595
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:56,200
[My true face.]

596
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,540
[That I can't reveal
even at the last moment.]

597
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,500
[I hope]

598
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:37,240
[you burn]

599
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,650
[my true face that I faked.]

600
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,380
Calm down.

601
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:16,050
Soo-hyun, calm down.

602
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,750
Let go of me!

603
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:20,820
Baek Soo-hyun!

604
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:24,820
That night, I had my son's body in my car.

605
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:27,630
Joon-young's dead body.

606
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:31,700
I was the one who took him to the place

607
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,430
where he was kidnapped!

608
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,500
Stop.

609
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:45,010
How? How could it happen?

610
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,880
Yeon-woo is here. Stop!

611
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:50,280
What do you mean?

612
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:56,590
Yeon-woo.

613
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:00,760
Yeon-woo, what I said is...

614
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:08,930
Let's stay outside until Dad calms down.

615
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,790
May I continue, sir?

616
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:40,030
Oh, yes, please.

617
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:44,070
Can you tell me the reason why

618
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,500
you decided to turn yourself in?

619
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:49,910
The reason.

620
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,580
[There are things you have to forget]

621
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,610
and things you shouldn't.

622
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:56,950
Don't confuse the two.

623
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:58,820
Yeon-woo.

624
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:03,590
He says nothing.

625
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,720
He doesn't talk
and acts like he doesn't know.

626
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:08,960
Just like how I always lived my life.

627
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,670
I can't do this anymore.

628
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:16,000
If you give up like this now,

629
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:18,800
you will lose Yeon-woo again.
Is that okay?

630
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:21,310
I already lost everything, Father.

631
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:24,540
No. Not for me.

632
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:27,350
You and Yeon-woo are still the same to me.

633
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:28,850
If you fall,

634
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:31,480
I can't endure it, Eun-soo.

635
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:34,150
I'm sorry, Father.

636
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:39,620
I always was.

637
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:51,270
Mr. Prosecutor.

638
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,240
It's the first day.

639
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:58,680
Let's finish the first investigation now.

640
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:00,650
I'm too tired.

641
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:01,910
Okay.

642
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:34,750
[We found your daughter.
The situation isn't good.]

643
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:44,290
Why?

644
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:48,960
How is Eun-soo?

645
01:02:56,170 --> 01:03:00,340
Hurry up and transfer her
to a different hospital

646
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:03,070
without the police and the hospital

647
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:06,010
knowing.

648
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:25,200
Did you do it?

649
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:28,630
Yes. It was me.

650
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:30,770
Where is Eun-soo?

651
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:33,770
Why do you ask me that?

652
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:38,310
Eun-soo. I asked where she is.

653
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:42,250
You will never find out.

654
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:48,150
Why? Do you think it's unfair?

655
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:53,560
Then you should've not pulled off the mask
to see what's under it.

656
01:03:53,890 --> 01:03:57,530
You should've not acted like a hypocrite
who wanted to find the truth.

657
01:03:58,330 --> 01:04:01,500
While you were turning the world
upside down to find the truth,

658
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:03,570
what do you think my Eun-soo did?

659
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:06,270
While you were shagging another woman,

660
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:09,240
when her child appeared
in front of Eun-soo,

661
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:11,880
what do you think Eun-soo did?

662
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,910
Your best? Atonement?

663
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:19,020
Your selfishness
that only cared about yourself

664
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,090
is the cause of all this!

665
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:24,990

01:22:30,610 --> 01:22:32,580
but it turned out
I've never even started walking.

833
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:38,680
Where have I been standing until now?

834
01:22:45,290 --> 01:22:46,290
Eun-soo.

835
01:22:48,190 --> 01:22:49,330
You found her, right?

836
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:50,830
I thought

837
01:22:52,730 --> 01:22:54,430
I should tell you first.

838
01:22:58,670 --> 01:23:01,570
I heard she's brain-dead.

839
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:17,150
That's where the hospital is.

840
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:23,930
About your question earlier...

841
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:26,700
Don't wait for too long

842
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,670
for the answer.

843
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:43,050
Soo-hyun.

844
01:23:55,190 --> 01:23:56,490
Where are you going?

845
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:01,670
Where should I be going?

846
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:28,180
[The Road: The Tragedy of One]

847
01:26:07,390 --> 01:26:08,490
Where's Mom?

848
01:26:25,010 --> 01:26:27,340
I'll read it later.

849
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:55,540
