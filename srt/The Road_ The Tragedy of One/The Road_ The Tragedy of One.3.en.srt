when things are clear
and they're about to close the case.

343
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,270
Why are you asking for it
when you know that?

344
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,340
Because you take all the good things.

345

What I truly want

is consolation.

351

I want to receive consolation.

352

Two people lost a child.

And one of them has nowhere to be sad.

You asked me earlier

485
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,160
if I got my memories back.

486
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,260
I did.

When I said I couldn't remember,

488

you seemed relieved.

489
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,470
To be honest,

490
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,610
I'm not sure.

491
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,750
I was worried bad memories might
come back and make you feel bad.

492
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,520
That's the first thing
that crossed my mind.

493

That was very selfish of me.

All right. Here.

Come on. Hurry.

Okay. Just one second.

I thought you should know too.

If I do, will that bring
the dead child back to life?

I'm not interested in how it's done,

-Yes?

Do I look not okay to you?

514

You've always asked me
if I was okay since we were in school,

00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,690
and I've always hated it! You know that?

I didn't mean to upset you. I'm sorry.

Am I okay?

Where were you with your child
when your friend's child died?

What are you talking about?

523
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,250
Is it weird that I'm not sad

524
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,550
about my child's death?

527
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,090
and at our own paces.

I don't think it's weird.

How would you feel if your child died?

Yes.

Yes.

You should do some politics too. Sure.

543

You see, animals are
very similar to humans.

544
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,930
When they get old,
they lose teeth and hair,

545
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:56,500
and their beaks and claws bend,
so they can't go hunting.

546
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,800
Then they would sit on the edge of a cliff

547
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:02,670
and starve to death.

548
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:05,970
However,

549
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,110
some of them do

550
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:12,340
weird things.

551
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:16,620
They would beat their beaks against rocks

552
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,080
with all their might and break them.

553
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:21,620
Then they pull out
all their feathers and claws

554
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:25,090
using the few teeth they have left.

555
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,990
Which makes them bleed a lot.

556
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:31,360
Then they stay still and wait.

557

I see.

559
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:40,440
They arm themselves again
with new weapons,

560
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:43,280
so they can hunt until they die.

561
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:48,910
So what do you say?

It was just a kid,
not a strong adult male.

they couldn't find a cause.

By the way, why did his parents
rush the funeral?

just because you didn't release the news?
