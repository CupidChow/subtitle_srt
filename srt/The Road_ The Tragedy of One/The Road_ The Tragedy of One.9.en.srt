You were worried a lot, right?

329
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,440
[-I'm fine.]
-What does it mean you kidnapped him?

330
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:13,180
It's Baek Soo-hyun's misunderstanding.
It was nothing.

331
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,280
What did you do? Answer me right now.

332
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,220
He tried to kill me.

333
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,050
He went crazy by himself.

334
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,490
Watch your words.

335
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,560
Where is the hospital?

336
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,430
Don't worry. I'm fine.

337
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,630
I said where is it?

338
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,380
Our CEO? He was with us all day.

339
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,020
There was a documentary shoot
of visually impaired people that day.

340
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,820
So he was at Hanseo-dong all day.

341
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,560
Did he stay for dinner
after the shoot ended?

342
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,460
Yes. The dinner was on him.

343
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:05,130
[He has an alibi that day
before the car accident.]

344
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,270
Is this also for promoting
our documentary?

345
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,210
Where was the shooting place?

346
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,180
[Dark Dining]

347
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,980
[1st 5:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.
2nd 8:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m.]

348
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,530
[Dark Dining, where you can see nothing,
which makes it more attractive.]

349
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:35,430
[A perfect meal you can feel with five
senses with visually impaired servers.]

350
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,800
When was the shoot?

351
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,670
At the second opening time.

352
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,240
Are these all the footage
filmed during the shoot?

353
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:45,010
Yes. We got footage
from the first opening time,

354
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,540
but we turned off the cameras
at the second opening time.

355
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,810
It was their request
regarding a copyright issue.

356
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:53,680
Our restaurant is often
introduced in the media, so...

357
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,520
You said it is completely dark
during the dinner, right?

358
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,590
The light is completely blocked
by special blackout screens.

359
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:04,490
When your eyes are covered, you can
feel something you can't feel otherwise.

360
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,560
It overwhelms some people.

361
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:10,500
We have visually impaired employees
because of the same reason.

362
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,830
Were you here throughout the shoot?

363
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,970
Of course.
It was to help the visually impaired.

364
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,340
Did Mr. Oh stay here
throughout the shoot as well?

365
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,510
He stayed with us until the shoot
ended after 11 p.m.

366
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,980
and for the dinner.

367
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,990
I see.

368
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:37,060
[Oh Jang-ho is in the footage filmed from
the beginning and to the end.]

369
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,790
[When it was blacked out
and even after that.]

370
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,160
[Oh Jang-ho was here all the way?]

371
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,770
[Say hi.]

372
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,470
[She's my girlfriend.]

373
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,010
[I'm Lee Mi-do.]

374
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,680
[She might know something.]

375
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,350
What's the matter?

376
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,790
I want to talk more.

377
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,890
Did Ms. Lee Mi-do come to work yet?

378
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,020
[She suddenly took a day off.]

379
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,790
[She said it's a family issue.]

380
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,000
I'm over here, Mi-do.

381
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,480
I don't want to see you cry.

382
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,050
I told you that before.

383
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:40,890
I heard you were shot and beaten up.

384
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,420
What happened?

385
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,130
There was a misunderstanding,

386
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,830
but it's not a big deal.

387
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,260
Let's talk about something else.

388
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,730
Here, sit down.

389
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,810
You hurt your hand too?

390
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,880
Mi-do, please.

391
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:21,630
I've been all over the place

392
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,630
trying to secure investments
for the movie.

393
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:30,040
I'm sorry if you felt
that I'd been neglecting you.

394
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,040
Do you remember

395
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,210
the movie we watched together at home

396
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,450
around this time last year?

397
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:44,220
The main character was a blind man.

398
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,050
Remember that movie?

399
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:48,820
Yes, I remember.

400
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,230
You know,

401
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,060
I really loved that movie.

402
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:02,470
To be more precise,
the moment we were watching it together

403
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,470
meant so much to me.

404
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:13,050
You explained every single scene to me,

405
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,050
as if you were my eyes.

406
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,190
Right.

407
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:24,020
I couldn't and still can't see anything,

408
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:28,900
but it doesn't matter.

409
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:43,480
It's our baby.

410
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,420
This is such happy news.

411
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,660
I won't ask you to be happy.

412
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,800
Mi-do, I'm...

413
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,900
The love you've given me so far

414
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,030
is more than enough for me.

415
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,970
But please

416
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,970
don't wander too far away

417
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,680
for our baby's sake.

418
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,050
Can you

419
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,520
promise me that one thing?

420
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,820
Mom?

421
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,090
You're up?

422
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:03,320
Why are you crying, Mom?

423
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,130
No.

424
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,230
I'm not crying.

425
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,700
I have to step out
to take care of something urgent.

426
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,400
The housekeeper will help you
with everything.

427
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,070
Okay.

428
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,810
Wait, Mom.

429
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:24,210
Can I touch your face?

430
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,180
Not now.

431
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,220
Maybe later.

432
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,780
I can't remember

433
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,750
your face.

434
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,920
Dad's face too.

435
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,260
I'm drawing a blank

436
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,960
as though I've never seen you before.

437
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,370
I'm sure it's just temporary.

438
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,940
It's...

439
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,640
Do you know

440
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:56,980
what's strange?

441
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:02,350
I clearly remember Joon-young's face,
but no one else's.

442
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,590
Then,

443
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,590
let's ask your doctor
when we're at the hospital tomorrow.

444
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,130
Okay.

445
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,560
Is it day or night right now?

446
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,470
It's day.

447
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,540
I see.

448
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,370
See you later, then.

449
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,970
I told you to go and grab a bite to eat.

450
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,540
Why are you already back?

451
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,110

452
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,060
Don't cry.

453
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,530
When I see you cry, I feel...

454
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,530
I'm sorry

455
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,100
for hurting you.

456
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,370
I really didn't want to hurt you.

457
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:11,409
Why would you do all this for me?

458
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,150
Why would you go this far because of me?

459
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:18,380
What if it costs you your life?

460
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,020
Don't cry, please.

461

Let me go. Please just give up.

No, please just abandon me now.

So please...

467
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,190
Please don't say that, okay?

468
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,590
Is it because of Soo-hyun?

469
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,430
I asked them to let him off,

470
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,330
so nothing will happen to him.
I give you my word.

471
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,170
That's not why.

472
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,370
You and I...
Have you forgotten how special it is?

473
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:18,680
What we have is very special,
and you know that.

474
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,780
We can't end it like this.

475
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,650
I'm in so much pain.

476
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:30,020
The pain is driving me crazy.

477
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,230
I can't even breathe.

478
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,390
Why are you in so much pain?

479
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,960
Is it because of Baek Soo-hyun?

480
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,570
Or is it because of me?

481
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,700
Me.

482
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,670
It's because of me and Yeon-woo.

483
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:52,610
I can't do this anymore.

484
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,220
Please, I beg you.

485
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,920
Eun-soo, what you need is time.

486
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,320
Don't give up.

487
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,460
Jang-ho, please.

488
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,030
I don't want to hear it.

489
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,300
You never came here,

490
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,970
and I never heard anything you said.

491
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,200
Leave this instant.

Was it this man?

820
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:12,660
Yes.

821
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:16,730
Then I got scared,

822
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:19,140
so I fled the scene.

823
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:21,940
I felt sick to my stomach all night.

824
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:23,610
And as for the phone...

825
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:27,850
I saw it on the road and picked it up
without thinking, as a reflex.

826
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:29,480
Why didn't you call the police?

827
01:06:32,450 --> 01:06:34,450
It was my first time seeing a dead body.

828
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,920
So clearly, I couldn't think straight.

829
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:39,820
But you were able to think straight
when striking a deal with Chairman Seo.

830
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:42,760
Of course. I had to have my head
straight for that.

831
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,030
If my college admission got canceled,

832
01:06:47,030 --> 01:06:49,170
I'd be starting off my life
as a total failure.

833
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:51,640
I could not let that happen.

834
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:55,070
Then what about starting a life
based on lies? Is that okay?

835
01:06:55,870 --> 01:06:57,110
Doesn't

836
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:00,710
everyone lie, after all?

837
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:03,710
Do you think

838
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:05,850
you're different?

Oh, my.

854
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:09,710
Perfect timing.

855
01:08:10,550 --> 01:08:12,050
How much do you know?

856
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:16,750
-Didn't she tell you?
-What are you talking about?

857
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:21,160
Goodness.
Our family really needs to talk more.

858
01:08:22,590 --> 01:08:23,689
It's all over now.

859
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:29,069
Or is it not?
Maybe we still have a long way to go

860
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:34,210
before it all blows over.

861
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:49,720
[I was livid after I read the will.]

862
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:52,120
Why?

863
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:56,590
Because my name was missing.

864
01:08:57,660 --> 01:08:59,930
On top of that, my son was only eligible
for a small share.

865
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,500
So right away, I raced off
to talk to the chairman about it.

866
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:08,970
But suddenly, there was a blackout.

867
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:12,779
When I got out of my car,

868
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,609
there was a dead man on the road.

869
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:18,520
My car had hit him.

870
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:22,120
Okay, go on.

871
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:27,060
I was panicking
and didn't know what to do.

872
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:29,960
But that moment,
Congressman Hwang called me

873
01:09:30,859 --> 01:09:32,200
and said his wife saw everything.

874
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:37,100
But how did his wife

875
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:40,200
witness the accident?

876
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:42,010
I don't know.

877
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:46,540
She's always been awfully interested
in our family matters.

878
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:51,680
He offered to take the body
and take care of the rest.

879
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:54,120
Up until then,

880
01:09:54,850 --> 01:09:58,290
I didn't even know who I had hit.
I found out on the news.

881
01:09:58,690 --> 01:09:59,760
Then what happened?

882
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:03,060
Congressman Hwang came with another man

883
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,360
and took the body.

884
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:07,300
After that,

885
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:11,040
I had my car scrapped as you already know.

886
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:15,040
That's everything.

887
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:21,480
Why do I feel like

888
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:26,080
you're telling me a fabricated story?

889
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:31,420
Fabricated or not,

Why did you take that route?

The main road would've been much faster.

946
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:16,380
Because we liked that route.

947

We drove along that route often
on rainy days.

948
01:14:22,850 --> 01:14:24,720
We'd park the car there

949
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:28,560
and listen to our favorite song together.

950

Whenever we did that, we felt like
we were the only ones in the world.

Even that night,
I asked him to take me there.

But suddenly, that accident happened.

Hey! This is crazy.

954

Why not just drive with your eyes closed?

01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:53,920
Why bother keeping them open?

Do you?

I'll take care of the car repair cost
and your hospital bills.

961

Then...

962
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,770
Are you admitting
that you're 100 percent at fault here?

963
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:17,880
Then say that again. I must record it.

964
01:15:19,710 --> 01:15:21,750
Wait. Should we take photos first?

965
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,690
-That must've startled you.
-Are you okay?

966
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:30,120
I'm fine.

967
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:34,420
He must've had trouble driving
because of the rain.

968
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:37,730
He was a novice driver.

969
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:41,200
They yelled at each other

970
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:43,530
and I got scared.

971
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:46,740
And

972
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,740
Jang-ho ended up doing what he wanted
just to end the situation.

973

Well.

974
01:15:53,310 --> 01:15:55,880
Did you hear the sound
of other cars or people?

975
01:15:55,950 --> 01:15:58,480
No. We were alone there.

976
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:00,080
We called our insurance companies

977
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:02,090

or did you hear anyone going out
when you were in bed?

980
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:13,960
No.

981
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,400
I was with him until the next morning.

982
01:16:16,830 --> 01:16:19,470
Did you come here to make me assure you
that Jang-ho is the culprit?

983
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:22,340
Why did you come here?

984
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:26,080
Are you lying for Oh Jang-ho?

985
01:16:29,550 --> 01:16:30,910
I know

986
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:33,180
the Yeon-woo business.

987
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:36,850
But he wouldn't have done
something like that

988
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:40,560
when he's going to be a father himself.

989
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:42,030
Never.

990
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:55,670
There are dozens of people
who saw Jang-ho on the day of incident.

991
01:16:55,870 --> 01:16:57,570
You must have checked it yourself.

992
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:02,010
You're suspecting him

993
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:05,320
because of Eun-soo, right?

994
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:12,060
What do you know?

995
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:15,830
I believe Jang-ho. I'm waiting for him.

You don't have to love me.

1002
01:18:55,090 --> 01:18:56,590
Jang-ho,

1003
01:18:57,430 --> 01:19:00,360
you are my eyes.

1004
01:19:03,630 --> 01:19:04,900
I'm sorry.

1005

Don't be sorry.

1006

To me,

1007

this is love.

1008
01:19:16,510 --> 01:19:17,510
What do you...

1009
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:22,620
want me to promise you?

1010
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:31,030
Could you be

1011
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:37,630
my eyes for the rest of my life?

1012

You can go far away if you want.

1013
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:45,640
Just make sure to come back

1014

I should go to Yeon-woo.

That's where I belong.
