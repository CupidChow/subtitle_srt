I don't like this. Throw it away.

489

-I'll make sure to throw it away, sir.
-One more thing.

490
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,940
Bae Kyung-sook touched the safe yesterday.

491
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,580
Keep an eye on her.

492
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,450
Yes, sir.

493
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:27,360
Sir. When did you come?

494
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,600
Could you check on the foundation's
library opening ceremony schedule?

Yes, ma'am.

Thank you.

Hello.

498
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:58,390
You're not supposed to come in here
without permission.

499
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,700
You're the one who opened
the safe without permission.

500
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,230
I didn't want to,

501
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,970
but neither my name nor my son's name
was on the will.

502

Am I the only one
who thinks it's a problem?

503
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,220
If you keep acting like this,
you might die.

504
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:32,560
Seo Ki-tae sure has raised his dog well.

505
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,560
I'm afraid

506
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,460
that dog is a crazy dog.

507
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:44,770
I wonder what I should do
to calm down the crazy dog.

Have you found anything?

525
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,620
No, he literally vanished.

526
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:11,990
He left no trace whatsoever.

527

There are no credit card

528

Both his phone number
and license plate are fake.

529
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,370
I still haven't heard anything
from the checkpoints and tollgates.

530

I want you to figure out

where the people on this list are as well.

532
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,810
Baek Soo-hyun has
so many enemies. It's unbelievable.

533
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,480
One of them even blackmailed him.

534
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,750
I'm nothing compared to him.

535
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:43,460
How did the voice print analysis go?
Was it related to the threatening call?

536
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,460
There was no voice print to analyze.

537
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,290
It wasn't a modulated voice.

538
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,000
The voice was generated by computer.

539
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:55,330
The phone number was on
an overseas server, so it's untraceable.

540
00:42:58,570 --> 00:42:59,770
Are you going out again?

541
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,670
Yes. I'm going back to the crime scene.

542
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,240
What for? I heard
they finished everything up there.

543
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:07,010
I know. I just want to check something.

544
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,310
I need to stop by Royal The Hill too.

545
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,920
Wait. Wasn't the warrant denied?

546
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:13,420
Because of that something gate
from a few years ago.

547

548
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,490
Right. That one.

549
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:18,460
I heard they removed
all surveillance cameras there

550
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,460
except for the ones at the entrance

551
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:22,960
and no one is allowed to enter
unless someone dies there.

552
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,800
I have to go there still.

553
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:27,070
We have a suspect, and it means
I must investigate him.

554
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:28,130
Okay.

555
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,100
Right, Seok-hoon. Do you know
when they'll send us more resources?

556
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,870
Tomorrow, at the latest. Why?

557
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:36,980

598

before the deadline.

I was filled with hope
that I could save my son.

he lured you here to arrive
around that time?

I'd have acted more calmly.

This wasn't an impulsive
or opportunistic kidnapping.

607
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,270
It was meticulously planned
over a long time.

608
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:11,140
It was a plan that could only succeed
if I failed completely.

Someone who is desperate as me
to get the original file.

616
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,760
It took half a year
to prepare for the report.

617
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,390
If there was a leak,

618
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:01,960
they must've had enough time to plan this.

619
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,330
Even so, kidnapping a child is...

The Special Investigation Unit
was put together right away,

that this was someone's big picture?

626

Seeing you reminded me of him.

627
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,860
I haven't seen him since he left home.

628
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,200
I wonder what he's up to.

629
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:43,940
It'd be good enough

630
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,340
if he's alive in times like this.

631
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:52,140
I don't resent you.

632
00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:57,920
Yoon Dong-pil is Kim Seok-pil.

633
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,630
That's why he can't be the suspect.

634
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:13,000

-It's not him.

640

-No.
-It's not his car.

641

-It's not his car.
-It's not.

642
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,780
-What was that?
-Are you sure he's coming?

643
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:37,890
I'll drop you off somewhere else.

644
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:43,430
No, I'll get off here.

645

It's amazing how she agreed to do it.

She's always thirsty, that's why.

She wouldn't miss a chance

their phone to make a call,

01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,990
And work hard for your recovery.

812
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:47,590
Yes, I'll do that.

-Yes?

834

836

Let's eat together.

844
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:24,110
How about Yeon-woo?

845
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:28,280
He's a little tired.

846
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:30,480
I thought it'd be better for him to sleep.

847
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:32,150
Can I see him for a moment later?

848
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:34,790
I heard about him from father-in-law
on the phone.

849
01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:36,290
But I'm so worried about him.

850
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:38,920
All right.

851
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:41,260
He's tired.

852
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:43,760
Don't wake him up.
Just eat and leave quietly.

853
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:47,570

854

to see Yeon-woo as well.

01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,080

856
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:05,880
What I'm saying is, he's my only nephew.

857
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:08,350
I want to make sure he's okay.

858
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:12,760
We had to keep it to ourselves.

859

Let's eat.

860
01:08:06,110 --> 01:08:07,650
Good for you.
You managed to keep your cool.

861
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:14,920
Jang-ho's restraining order
was lifted a few days ago.

862
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:19,189
I should have checked.
I totally let my guard down.

863
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:26,160
Looks like he met someone nice
and has changed a lot.

864
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:29,029
He said he's still working
on his documentary,

865
01:08:30,939 --> 01:08:32,569
and he's started writing a new script.

866

867

Why don't we have him
stay with my father for a while?

870
