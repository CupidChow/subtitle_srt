493

You weren't covering a story.

494

-Calm down.
-You...

498

499

502

What is the secret

503
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,820
you're hiding?

504
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,360
It's what everyone is hiding.

505
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,160
That's all.

506

-Yes?
[-Your relative is here.]

510

[Looks like he met someone nice
and has changed a lot.]

513
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:39,570
He said he's still working
on his documentary,

514
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,370
and he's started writing a new script.

515
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:44,580

516
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:56,260
No.

517
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,690
That'd never happen.

518
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:14,210
I warned you. I told you to never show up.

519

520

521

-Why is it always you?
-How much more will you torture us?

522
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,580
You've already tortured us enough!

523

You're the one who's torturing, not me.

525
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:30,360
Not for yourself and your news,

526
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,990
-do you care about anything else?
-Shut it!

527
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:36,260
Do you think you have
any right to say that?

528
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,400
Right?

529
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:40,530
Why don't I have the right?

530
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,140
I have a right too!

531
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,340
I'm Yeon-woo's biological father.

532
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,620

533

No, it's okay.

535

Where is Mom?

536
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:19,540
Is she not here yet?

537
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,110
She's at your place.

538
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:27,980
Your mom and dad need to
spend some time together,

539
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:30,250
so let's be more understanding.

540
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:33,150
Okay.

541
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:38,820
You were addicted to drugs
and neglected him.

542
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,160
You sold him off,

543
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:42,960
and now you want to be his dad?

544
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:48,200
After his mom, Eun-ho, died,
I was in deep pain.

545
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:51,540
But you used my sense of guilt
to take him from me.

546
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:54,140
Why are you blaming me?

547
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:55,740
Guilt?

548
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:01,010
After sending Yeon-woo to us,

549
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,850
what did you do with the money
you got from Chairman Seo?

550
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,190
You swore you'll never see Yeon-woo again.

551
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:10,020
And you spent that money
to do drugs again.

552
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,720
After that money ran out,

553
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:14,890
you tormented us all
by asking to give Yeon-woo back.

554
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,830
No, I never did that!

555
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,000
If you think of Yeon-woo at all,

556
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:27,570
don't ever show up again.

557
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:30,840
I'm his dad.

558
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,910
Then

559
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:36,350

560
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:42,520
Give back Eun-ho to me, at least.

561
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,860
What?

562
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,840
Eun-ho.

563
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:01,040
Come with me.

564
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:03,780
Come.

565
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,460
Eun-ho

566
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,100
is dead.

567
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,120
You shouldn't be here. Let's go inside.

568

569

570
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:19,550

572

Your Eun-soo.

573
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,220
If you want to ask me something,

574
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,350
ask me now.

575
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:34,930
I... I mean...

576
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:36,460
A few years ago,

577
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:39,230
I met him a few times behind your back.

578
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,330
No.

579
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:43,170
You don't have to explain.

580
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:45,970
He seemed desperate,

581
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,370
and I couldn't refuse.
I let him eat out with Yeon-woo.

582
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,880
-After that...
-He is Yeon-woo's biological dad.

583
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,180
He was your sister, Eun-ho's husband.

584
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:00,650
-I'm sorry.
-Don't apologize.

585

586
