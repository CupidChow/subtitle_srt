171
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,790
Only then will she come back
and beg me with the will.

172
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:19,850
Yes, sir.

173
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,090
Seriously, look. Which one do you prefer?

174
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,160
How about having different eyes?

175
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,170
It sounds good.

176
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,550
Don't go anywhere else
and leave the country tomorrow.

177
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,150
Do you want me to stay here?

178
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,720
Is there any flight leaving now?

179
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,660
Do you want to take any plane and go?

180
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,960
I don't like to stop over.

181
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,930
How many times did I say it's suffocating?

182
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,990
Those that are not flag carriers
have terrible service.

183
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,200
How about your phone?
You turned it off, right?

184
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,100
Of course I did.

185
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,400
Don't use your credit card.

I don't know.

187
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,840
What are you going to say to the Chairman?

188
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,840
That your depression came back,

189
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,050
so you went to Dr. Kim for treatment.

190
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,920
It's mental illness again.

191
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,090
How long will the exile last this time?

192
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,630
For how many months should I act
like I'm a mental patient?

193
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,600
You know what crazy things I did
because of you, right?

194
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,340
Get it together if you don't want
them to take everything away from you.

195
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,910
Don't miss the flight.

196
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,870
How is it going?

197
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,310
Did the Chairman eat?

198
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,340
He's at his studio.

199
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,150
Come home safe.

200
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,880
Nothing is more important than your life.

201
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,910
You've never waited for me before.

202
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,990
The moment you saw Eun-soo,
how did you feel?

203
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:09,920
Were you nervous because you thought
you were caught?

204
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,630
No. She was suspicious of you.

205
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,670
Was the trust that fragile?

206
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,900
I'm disappointed, Soo-hyun.

207
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,370
Don't ever drag Eun-soo into this again.

208
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,710
She's nothing more
than a trophy wife to you.

209
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,710
I said you're the same kind
of person as me.

210
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,310
Stop pretending.

211
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,780
Stop pretending to care
about Eun-soo and your family.

212
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,620
You don't have to put on that act
in front of me.

213
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,890
After all, that's why you chose me.

214
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,460
I chose the show, not you.

215
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,760
You were going to use
another plan from the get-go.

216
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,890
Stop bluffing.

217
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,530
That's right.

218
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,740
You were good today,
so I'll give you three days as a reward.

219
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,770
I'm doing the interview on Friday,
no matter what.

220
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,010
Clear up the suspicion
and get things sorted out before that.

221
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,310
But why this Friday?

222
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,850
Let's just say it'll be a way
of congratulating myself.

223
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,020
Director Kwon must be your other card.

224
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,990
You got the prime-time Saturday
investigative journalism show,

225
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,590
so you need to do the interview on Friday.

226

You look confident again.

227
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,600
I hate that.

228
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,130
Can you keep this attitude
even when Eun-soo finds out?

229
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,300
No.

230
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,540
What if everyone finds out about us?

231
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,110
Can you still be this confident?

232
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,010
Careful.

233
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,110
You have more to lose than I do.

234
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,980
Don't look at me like that.

235
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,850
A sin always leaves a trace.

236
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,460
In our case, that's Joon-young.

Did you say a reporter contacted us?

816
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,880
Yes, sir. A reporter named Park Sung-hwan.

817
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,350
I checked,
and he's an entertainment reporter.
