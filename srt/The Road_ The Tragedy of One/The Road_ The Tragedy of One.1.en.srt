Well done!

-Goodness.
-Let's go.

493
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,940
This is exciting.

494
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,290
Dad, you said you couldn't make it.

495
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,290
Did something happen?

496
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,630
No.

497
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,300
I came to see you play.

498
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:46,730
Really?

499
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,370
You never come to my game.
I should've played better.

500
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,910
Once this project I'm working on is over,
I'll practice with you.

501

Really? Are you sure this time?

00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,840
Promise me.

503
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,650
Yes. I promise you.

504

Okay.

505
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,480
Joon-young, could you pass me the ball?

506
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,820
Thanks.

Right.

His parents didn't come.

How did you guys come together?

513
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,520
Dad came to pick me up.

514
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,920
Dad went to the game?

515
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,090
Yes. It would've been perfect
if we won the game.

516
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,220
I'll go take a shower.

517

No.

522
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:07,550
Does it have something to do
with that wound?

523
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,780
Oh, this is just a scratch.
It has nothing to do with this.

524
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:14,420
I don't want you to worry even more,
so I'll stop asking.

525
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:15,750
I should take a shower.

526
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:54,160
Stop calling me and wait.

527

Don't overwork yourself.

Don't worry.
I just need to wrap something up.

But that event...

537

You'll be uncomfortable
and people will gossip.

I can deal with that.

All right.

No.

I'll try calling her again.

Can you not call her?

551
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,150
I should. She'll be worried.

Let's call her, okay?

553
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:35,930

You must have many at your place.

Is that why you got yourself into trouble?

Why bring up something that's over?

on covering it up?

You'll get the money back eventually.

in advance?

I didn't think you could make it.
How did you manage to come?

I don't need a reason
to accompany my wife, do I?

608
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,460
A wise answer to my foolish question.

609
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:30,830
That's true. Family doesn't need
a reason to be together.
