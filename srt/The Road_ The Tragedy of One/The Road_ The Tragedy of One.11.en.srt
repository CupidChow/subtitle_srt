00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,360
[Those two...]

325
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,360
[They had an affair.]

326
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,100
[For a long time.]

327
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,430
[Did you feel guilty?]

328
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,700
Then you should've told me
not to tell him.

329
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,970
That's what friends do.

330
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,570
What is there to keep it a secret?

331
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,040
I know you act all innocent,
but dirty on the inside.

332
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,570
You're at a disadvantage.

333
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:58,150
[She never denied her relationship...]

334
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,680
[with Oh Jang-ho.]

335
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,450
Jae-yeol.

336
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,920
Yes.

337
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,150
Let's talk just the two of us.

338
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,990
She's the last person to suspect.

339
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:16,000
Eun-soo was desperately searching
for Yeon-woo that day.

340
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,530
How can you say that?

341
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
Is that so?

342
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,830
Did you see it yourself?

343
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,400
Did you call her?

344
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,210
What's the matter with you?

345
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,540
I know it's hard for you.
But this isn't right.

346
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,610
Isn't it strange?

347
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,680
Oh Jang-ho's house was filled
with Seo Eun-soo,

348
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,080
his madness, and obsession.

349
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,850
But there isn't a single line
saying Seo Eun-soo.

350
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,250
-What?
-If he was a stalker that obsessive,

351
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,250
there would've been a letter
or a journal talking about her at least.

352
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,560
But there was nothing.

353
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,290
There should be at least something
he scribbled with anger.

354
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,930
What are you talking about?

355
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,360
That's...

356
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,370
Think about evidence of crime.

357
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,700
It's all organized.

358
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,770
As if it's telling us not to look at
anything else as he's the criminal.

359
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:03,310
What do you want to say?

360
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,710
The situation is the same.

361
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,210
As if

362
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:10,350
the strategy to hide something else
worked perfectly.

363
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,550
So what you're saying is...

364
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:18,430
Oh Jang-ho did that

365
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,030
to hide the affair with Eun-soo?

366
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,100
What if he was trying to hide
not only the affair,

367
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,870
but also her crime?

368
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,840
Are you...

369
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,310
The kidnap wasn't a mistake.

370
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,080
Seo Eun-soo.

371
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,120
She's an accomplice.

372
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,160
You went too far.

373
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,290
It doesn't make sense.

374
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,330
I should ask her myself.

375
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,430
Yes.

376
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,300
That would be better.

377
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,770
Hey, where are you going?

378
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,680
Why did you come?

379
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,890
My family and Yeon-woo.

380
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,390
Do you still want to torture us?

382
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,330
Did you enjoy the secret rendezvous

383
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,230
you had at the hotel
after parting with me?

384
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,670
You're not denying it again.

385
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,800
What are you doing?

386
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,440
On the day my Joon-young died,

387
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,140
what did you do?

388
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,880
Did you meet Oh Jang-ho?

389
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,710
Joon-young caught you two shagging, right?

390
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,080
That's why you killed my baby.

391
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,880
-Cha Seo-young.
-If not,

392
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,820
why did Soo-hyun

393
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,120
try to kidnap Oh Jang-ho and kill him?

394
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,460
Why did he go into that house

395
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,790
and suffer like that?

396
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,860
That day...

397
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,200
Jang-ho tried to kidnap Yeon-woo.

398
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,300
Jang-ho?

399
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,400
If you two didn't plan it together,

400
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,600
what did you do in the meantime?

401
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,470
What were you doing
when your boyfriend killed my baby?

402
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,810
It's not what you think.
He's not my boyfriend!

403
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:46,870
If not,

00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,210

Are your memories back as well?

413
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,720
You saw something that day.

[-Okay.]

421
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,650
See you again.

anything you remember?

432
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,230
I can't tell

433
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,140
whether they're just dreams or reality.

434

What about the other charges?

They already have the culprit,

-The hit-and-run charge.

I think I was scared
to think about Joon-young.

816
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,610
But I want to know now.

817
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:17,240
About why Joon-young had to die like that.

818
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:23,650
Do you understand me?

819
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:30,260
Mom.

820

821
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,990
Yeon-woo did nothing wrong.

822

Please don't do this.

823
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:40,030
Don't come close. I won't do anything.

824
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,870
Seo-young, please.

825
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:44,140
Answer me over there.
What happened that day?

826
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:45,770
Okay.

827
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:48,710
Just send Yeon-woo to me.

828
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,580
Not before you tell me the truth.

829
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:55,010
I was never loved.

830
01:00:58,150 --> 01:00:59,220
Soo-hyun

831
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:03,660
was always looking somewhere far.

832
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:07,060
One day, Jang-ho appeared in my life.

833
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,760
At first,

834
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:12,100
I thought he was seeing dead Eun-ho in me.

835
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,100
I pitied the guy
who lost both his wife and child.

836
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:19,470
So? Is that why you cheated on him?
And you wanted to hide it?

837
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:22,540
Our relationship isn't like that.
You're misunderstanding.

838
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:24,940
He loved me one-sidedly

839
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,850
to the point that it made me sick.

840
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:30,580
It was a burden to me,

841
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,650
but I saw myself in him.

842
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:37,860
Because he looked like me
looking at Soo-hyun.

843
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:41,460
I pitied him. I sympathized with him.

844
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:42,960
That's all.

845
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:47,330

847

I took advantage of his feelings.

848
01:01:58,540 --> 01:01:59,480
You know that too.

849
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:01,010
Answer my question right now.

850
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:04,780
Ms. Cha, it hurts.

851
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:10,190
Why did Oh Jang-ho
who was crazy for you kill my son?

852

853
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:17,030
You know why.

854
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:19,260
Tell me

855

as it is.

856
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,480
Hold on.

857

Wear this so we can judge the situation.

858
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:38,550
You might be very worried about Yeon-woo,

859
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:40,790
but please just listen and stall for now.

860

Everyone will be here in five minutes.

861

You shouldn't provoke her until then.

862

That's what Detective Shim told me to say.

863

Wait.

864

866

Release Yeon-woo.

867
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:47,750
If I don't have Yeon-woo,

868
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:51,660
you guys will try to fool me again.
I can't let that happen.

869

I know why Joon-young died.

870

Please promise me
you will let Yeon-woo go.

871

No.

You tell me first.

873

874
01:04:11,210 --> 01:04:14,980
to such a high place,

875

01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:26,420
No!

01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:27,690
It's because of me.

879

Oh Jang-ho wanted to punish me.

881
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,030
He kidnapped Yeon-woo to punish me

882
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:36,930
and things went wrong. Then...

883
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,200
he killed Joon-young.

884

to do with it. So please.

900
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:21,070
Talk!

901

that Joon-young was my son.

So what?

906
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,970
What did he do when he found out?

907
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:23,100
When he found out
that he kidnapped the wrong kid,

908
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,640
he probably remembered that.

909

I'm guessing that's why he killed him.

And the accomplice?

911
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,690

when I'm not the killer?

979
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:15,700
Do you know what I did
after Joon-young died?

980
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:18,900
[Even at the moment he was dying...]

981
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:20,200
I...

982
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,540
[I'm sorry.]

983
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,040
I'm sorry.

984
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:28,450
I could've just revealed everything
from the beginning and give up.

985
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:30,950
What kind of son was Joon-young?

986
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:35,690
I can't do this anymore.

987
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:38,860
Please...

988
01:11:42,990 --> 01:11:44,730
It has to be Oh Jang-ho and Seo Eun-soo.

989
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:49,170
Seo Eun-soo.

990
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:53,270
It has to be you.

991
01:12:11,690 --> 01:12:12,720
Seo-young.

992
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,990
[The person you should punish...]

993
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,060
Is me.

994
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:26,900
I am...

01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:31,840
the other person who is responsible

996
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:38,080
for Joon-young's death.

997
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:46,560
No.

998
01:12:49,090 --> 01:12:50,230
That can't be.

999
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:54,500
-It's all a lie!
-Yeon-woo.

1000
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,100
-Dad.
-Yeon-woo.

1001
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:01,840
-Dad...
-Are you all right?

1002
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:03,540
It's okay. Don't cry.

1005
01:13:56,530 --> 01:13:59,300
I'm going to make everyone
point their fingers at him.

1006
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,360
Dad, please.

1007
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:02,430
[I need a witness.]

1008
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:05,470
I'm not ready to fall yet.

1009
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:07,240
Why are you doing all this?

1010
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:09,210
[Only after losing everything,
I finally learned]

1011
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:11,880
[that all I had was a handful of sand.]

you were and what kind of life]
