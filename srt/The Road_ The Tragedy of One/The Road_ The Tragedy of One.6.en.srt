Things might get complicated
in the morning.

329

I have a duty to protect my family.

330
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,280
Can Soo-hyun do the same?

331
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,680
Just wait another day or two.

Good.

Yes.

Nothing at all.

You should answer it.
It must be about your exhibition.

It's too bad that it keeps
getting postponed. My goodness.

You keep pushing me away,

Because you feel
that one mistake is snowballing now?

I never thought it was a mistake.

You see, I've lived long enough to know

00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:34,440
that you should never believe
that anyone will keep your secrets.

392

It's not like you can rip people's mouths

I told you about the marine tourism
development deal.

Everything was already decided.
Why did you have to bring it up again?

My goodness.

411
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:44,480
I just wanted people to think that
we are doing everything by the book.

412
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:48,409
It was all for show,
but it caused some misunderstandings.

413

Chairman Seo must be very upset.

Do you not want to eat these
because they're leftovers?

430
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:36,760
Even rotten fish gets served to a king
if it's fermented well,

431
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,830
and I'm a nobody.

Something keeps getting stuck
between my teeth.

But it won't come out.

434

That's why I signed up
for multiple dental insurance plans.

435

You never know when you'll get cavities.

My goodness.

437

By now, you should be able to trust
that I'll take care of things.

438
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,450
You didn't have to come all the way here

439
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,950
just because you were summoned
for a police investigation.

440
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,890
Are you antsy because
you'll be joining the Blue House soon?

441
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,590
The police investigation isn't
the problem.

442
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,090
I'm just worried
I'd end up taking the fall.

443
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,900
Besides, I'm not the antsy one here.

I was wondering why
you were looking so youthful these days.

451
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,490
Turns out,
there was a special reason for it.

A secret hobby
of a fourth-term congressman.

453

This won't be a simple scandal.

Are you trying to end my political career?

Do you think you'll be safe
if you do that?

457
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,340
We must survive together

00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,910
so that we can take a photo
at the Blue House.

I have a lot of insurance.

The drink feels very smooth in my mouth.

466

Smooth like an old snake climbing a wall.

00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:54,190
Make it a silky wall then.

468

It'll climb the wall even more smoothly.

You're asking big favors.

-Yes, sir.

See what’s happening
to the initial investment in the fund

in other master funds.

Do you think it’ll be okay?

Just make sure this doesn't get out.

Yes, sir.

is none of our business.

Sure. What else can I do?

494

I'm coming from someone else's
scholarship awards ceremony.

495
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,310
Why?

496
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,880
Because of Chairman Seo,
I lost my financial support.

497

I thought we both agreed on this.

I also paid back my debt...

500

501

What do we do now then?

502
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,970
Should we report each other to the police?

503
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,040
You know that's not an option

504

was a thief's money,

Chairman Seo is scarier than prison.

511

yours put both of us in trouble?

I'm sorry,
but we'll have to see each other again.

520
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,600

Okay. Bye.

528

we should forgive the sin, did they?

What's wrong with that? It's a nice photo.

548

It was also weird that Chairman Seo is
involved in the memorial event.

Which memorial event?

568

[-But what if you've already lost her?]

815

I'll try harder.

816
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:36,390
Just don't try to do anything.
It disgusts me.

817
01:10:36,730 --> 01:10:38,430
Just say the truth.

818
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,600
You saw the culprit that day, didn't you?

819
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:42,970
Why won't you say anything?

820
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,740
Why? Are you the culprit?

821
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:48,970
-Is that it?
-Dong-pil.

822
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:52,210
-Calm down.
-How can I calm down?

823
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:56,210
The police are saying I did it.
They think I killed her!

824
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,020
She's just still considered missing.

825
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,980
All of this will blow over
once they find her.

826
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:02,950
But if that jerk keeps his mouth shut,

827
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,590
my life will be over.

Hey.

831
01:11:16,970 --> 01:11:18,500
Why can't you just tell them what you saw?

832
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:20,040
Then Dong-pil will be released.

833
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:22,810
I told you that I'll get this sorted out.

834

This is the answer to my effort.

837
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:46,360
Tell Dong-pil that I kept my promise.

838

842

843

Thank you.

844
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,710
I'll prescribe you stronger meds

if Kim Seok-pil's original file
goes public, right?

Everyone is making so much fuss
over a mere copy.

856

Of course, I'm fully aware.
Why would I lie, knowing that?

864

This isn't good.

I actually shot a congressman.

Everyone will think it was an accident.

867

I'll just have to pay a small fine

Why did he offer to hand over
the original file to me?

There are many media outlets
he could've made a deal with.

882
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,110
Because you're the chairman's son-in-law,

883
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:20,140
you reporting it would strike
a bigger blow at Chairman Seo.

884
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:25,280
Why are you asking me
about something you already know?
