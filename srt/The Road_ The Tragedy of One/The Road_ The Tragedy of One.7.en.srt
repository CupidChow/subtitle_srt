Tell me first.

00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,260
Shouldn't you look for Soo-hyun first
if you have time to argue with me?

353
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,340
He saw a psychiatrist earlier today.

354
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,850
The psychiatrist prescribed him
a bunch of drugs.

355
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,120
I'm friends with one of the doctors there.

356
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,190
I asked them to get me
the CCTV footage from the parking lot

357
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,320
to see where he went after that.

358
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,130
Why didn't I think of that?

359
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,360
Didn't you notice anything off about him
these days?

360
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,860
You know how Soo-hyun is.
But he passed out

361
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,470
and almost blew his show.

362
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:42,200
Didn't you think it was strange?
I mean, you're his wife.

363
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:44,940
He was just overworked.

364
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,410
There was nothing more to it.

365
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,240
Or you never noticed because
you were busy with something else.

366
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,420
You know,

367
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,250
he might have made a bad choice.

368
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,620
How could you say such a thing?

369
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,120
How could you say that so easily?

370
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,830
It's a speculation based on
what I've seen in the past two days.

371
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,030
I bet you're confident
that you know him best.

372
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:16,140
Don't be delusional.
I know him better than you do.

373
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,610
We were on the same team for seven years.

374
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,910
We went through more things together

375

than you have in your ten-year marriage.

Don't kid yourself.

What you went through with him
meant nothing to him.

Is that so?

Then tell me.

820
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:03,610
[Even now, you're hiding something again.]

821
01:13:41,410 --> 01:13:42,710
It's me, Jang-ho.

822
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:22,590
[Send a text message to Dad.]

823
01:14:23,850 --> 01:14:25,960
[Please repeat.]

824
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:28,030
Send a text message to Dad.

825
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:31,300
[Would you like to send
a text message to Dad?]

826
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:32,330
Yes.

827
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:36,430
[This is a simple kidnapping.]

828
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,010
Are you Baek Soo-hyun's son?

829
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:52,820
[If you don't do as I say,
your son will die.]

830
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:55,050
[If you report to the police,
your child will die.]

831
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,590
[Don't make it complicated.]

832
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,170
[Do as I say from now on.]

833
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,010
[If you don't do as I say,
your son will die.]

834
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:20,380
[If you report to the police,
your child will die.]

835
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:23,710
[Three billion won in total.]

836
01:15:24,350 --> 01:15:28,020
[Send cryptocurrency worth
2.5 billion won within an hour.]

837
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:31,660
[Let's exchange 500 million in cash
for the kid in person.]

838
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:34,530
[It's to create the link of trust
between us.]

839
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:38,000
[Be on time. Or you'll see a dead body.]

840
01:15:40,430 --> 01:15:41,670
Darn it.

841
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,230
[This is a simple kidnapping.]

842
01:15:45,870 --> 01:15:47,470
[Don't make it complicated.]

843
01:15:49,610 --> 01:15:50,940
[Send money. It'll be over.]

844
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:07,260
[He's somewhere safe.]

845
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:10,860
[The Road: The Tragedy of One]

846
01:16:44,190 --> 01:16:47,030
[I want there to be
as much commotion as possible tomorrow.]

847
01:16:47,330 --> 01:16:49,070
[The original file is the only card.]

848
01:16:49,470 --> 01:16:51,740
[But doing anything rash,
it could backfire.]

849
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:53,270
[I told you.]

850
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:55,710
I'm the one who truly loves you.

851
01:16:56,010 --> 01:16:58,210
What is your secret?

852
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,080
Who else has your back
other than Congressman Hwang?

853
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:02,250
Can you retrieve something for me?

854
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:04,280
What did you see
on the day of the kidnapping?

855
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:06,480
Where is the original file? Where is it?

856
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:09,220
[From the get-go, all of it. It was you.]

857
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:13,260
Eun-ho. Come with me.
