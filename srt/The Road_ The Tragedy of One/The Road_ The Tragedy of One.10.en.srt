That you're Yeon-woo's mother.

you did that night on tape.

I opened the doors for you
to the Blue House.

You must know that I can close it as well.

You didn't say anything,

152

so I didn't come forward.

153

Why not?

154
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,460
Were you afraid that attacking
Baek Soo-hyun without my permission

155
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,820
would upset me?

It takes less than half a day

If you don't make the first move,

a little before 10 p.m.,]

have been looking for the killer?

Maybe it wasn't business related.
Was he holding a grudge or something?

Could that be why he lied?

there's no way back.

488
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,880
For both you and me.

489
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,940
Stop Baek Soo-hyun's News Night team.

490
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,700
Gosh, I barely managed
to avoid Director Kwon...

491
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,710
Where is he?

492
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,280
-Jae-yeol.
-Hey.

493
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,550
-We have a problem.
-Why?

494
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,290
I think they're going
to destroy Soo-hyun today.

495
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:07,850
-What?
-Hurry.

496
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,020
How shameless of you to call me.

497
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,390
Okay. Let me hear it for once.

498
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,400
[News Studio]

499
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,560
What are you doing? Please move.

500
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,800
You can't go in.

501
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,970
-Move!
-Please move.

502
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,640
What was that? How dare you touch her.

503
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,810
Who ordered this?

504
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,840
I said, who ordered this?

505
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,080
You think you can just say
anything you want on News Night?

506
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,180
How about the studio control room?

507
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,920
It's the same. It's blocked.

508
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,490
All the News Night team members
are excluded from this.

509
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,920
This is insane.

510
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,720
Take a look.

511
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,450
Don't get me wrong.

512
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:24,020
I'm not here to do you a favor.
I'm here for another reason.

513
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,160
I figured out where Oh Jang-ho went on
the day of incident. His alibi is false.

514
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,100
Is that it?

515
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:35,470
You're suspecting Oh Jang-ho
for a very private reason.

516
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,900
I know that.

517
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,810
It doesn't matter.

518
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,440
What's more important is
to find out who the kidnapper is.

519
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,640
I know you're suspecting him too.

520
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:50,420
That's nonsense! I didn't do it!

521
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:53,490
No.

522
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,160
I'm not helping you anymore.

523
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,920
This is my case.
I'll catch the culprit on my own.

524
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,430
Does that sound familiar to you?

525
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,600
I need your help.

526
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,660
Help?

527
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:07,870
Why should I?

528
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,400
If you're so desperate, convince me.

529
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:13,270
Go on and try.

530
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:19,910
Hyun-seo.

531
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,650
Kim Hyun-seo.

532
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,320
Who's that?

533
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,590
The teenage girl

534
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,960
who was kidnapped in Yeongsan
and then went missing.

535
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,300
She's the Kim Hyun-seo we know.

536
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,100
I got rid of

537
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,470
Kim Hyun-seo's body.

538
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,050
It was you?

539
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,950
You're the one who killed her?

540
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,760
Answer me!

541
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,200
Come on.

542
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,230
Please pick up the phone, Soo-hyun.

543
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,980
Everyone's crazy.

544
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:25,780
They totally lost their mind.

545
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,320
How could you do that?

546
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:41,890
That's when I learned

547
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,600
that human bodies become heavier
when dead.

548
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:50,940
I was so terrified
I had no idea what I was doing.

549
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,610
But then the fear soon disappeared.

550
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,080
[The body sank so fast.]

551
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,050
And it's now my eternal nightmare.

552
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,790
I know I'm just making excuses.

553
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:16,360
But I had to remove the evidence
to save everyone.

554
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:26,810
Both Hyun-seo and Dong-pil

555
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,310
are dead now.

556
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,180
Now, you're the only one
I can apologize to.

557
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,080
I want to apologize properly.

558
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:39,120
Please help me finish the whole thing

559
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:40,950
and make amends.

560
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,790
Once this case
and the last coverage are over,

561
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:47,160
however you want to punish me,

562
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:51,860
I'll listen to you.

563
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,170
You act all selfless,
but in fact, you're selfish.

564
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:02,110
All this time, you've been
only thinking about yourself!

565
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,630
[On air]

566
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,900
We'd like to apologize

567
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,430
to all our dear viewers
who have been watching us

568
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,340
for the past seven years.

569
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:32,640
We'll accept any criticism against us.

570
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,340
We hope you understand
that this is a process

571
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:40,050
of taking ourselves to the next level
by removing the old.

572
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:42,410
Now, let me begin today's News Night.

573
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:46,720
The first news is,
the truth of Anchor Baek Soo-hyun.

574
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,760
-Hello, Reporter Yang.
-Hello.

575
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,630
[He conciliated and blackmailed
the reporter who took the pictures.]

576
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:56,430
[Yes. On the screen behind you,
you can see a footage from a CCTV.]

577
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:01,000
[He seems quite intimidating
on both footages.]

578
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:03,100
[Yes. There's more.]

579
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:06,770
[It turns out that Yeongsan's missing
girl case, which had been a cold case,]

580
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,210
[was also related to Anchor Baek.]

581
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,710
[I'm sure you all remember the case.]

582
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:12,210
[Teenage Girl Went Missing in Yeongsan]

583
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:12,440
[The Yeongsan's Missing Girl Case
Ends Up a Cold Case]

584
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,980
[It's a case where a teenage girl
was kidnapped in Yeongsan]

585
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:16,450
[and then went missing.]

586
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:20,750
[That's right. After 480 days of
investigation, the case had been closed.]

587
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,150
[The case went cold ever since.]

588
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,960
And Anchor Baek is related to that case?

589
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,060
Yes.

590
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:29,300
It turns out he was even getting

591

[The National Anchor's Endless Fall]

592
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,400
[psychological treatment until
very recently, because of the case.]

593
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,370
[And?]

594
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:37,170
[His symptoms worsened,]

595
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,210
[and during an argument with a relative,]

596
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:43,580
[he kidnapped and threatened
the relative with a rifle,]

597
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,140
[which shocked everyone.]

598
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:50,550
What must I do

599
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,620
for you?

600
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:25,280
Was today's session difficult?

601
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,360
This way.

602
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:51,810
Did you know
about the Yeongsan murder case?

603
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,750
-What's your stance on this?
-Could you tell us?

604
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:56,650
Since when did you know about the affair?

605
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,450
Were you close to that person?

606
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,450
Is it true that Mr. Baek had an affair?

607
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,120
Mom, what's going on?

608
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,960
No, it's not true.

609
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:14,530
It wasn't me! I don't know anything!

610
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,300
-It wasn't me.
-Calm down, Yeon-woo.

611
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,310
-This will go away soon.
-No.

612
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,940
No, it wasn't me.

613
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:26,010
Can you tell us?

614
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,950
Please say something!

615
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:37,220
Can you tell us?

616
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:40,160
Any comments?

617
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,660
-Please say something!
-No.

618
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:44,300
No, I don't know anything.

619
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,540
[Director Jo, I need to ask you a favor.]

620
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,340
I need the medical records
of Cha Seo-young

621
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,850
and her family.

622
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,680
Yes.

623
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,790
You finally got settled.

624
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:16,560
Where shall we celebrate?

625
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,460
Next time.

626
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:19,870
What is it?

627
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:21,800
I'll be really disappointed

628
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:25,700
if you say something like
being on top is nothing special.

629
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:27,840
It's not that.

630
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:30,510
I need some time to recharge.

631
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:33,810
Okay.

632
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:35,710
Good work.

633
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,680
-See you tomorrow.
-Good night.

634
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,860
The celebration with you.

635
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,160
I'll book somewhere nice.

636
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,360
Okay, let's do that.

637
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,340
Yes. I heard about it,

638
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,610
but how urgent is it?

639
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,180
I'll explain on the way.

640
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:10,050
But I'm not Chairman Seo's
personal doctor,

641
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:12,180
so I'm not sure if this is right.

642
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:13,750
Mr. Choi Nam-gyu and his wife

643
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:15,520
recommended you.

644
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,420
Well, in that case, let's go.

645
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:15,680
This is a celebratory drink.
It's all over.

646
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:24,620
This will do, right?

647
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:30,400
It will, right?

648
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:44,010
Join me. Have a drink.

649
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:58,020
