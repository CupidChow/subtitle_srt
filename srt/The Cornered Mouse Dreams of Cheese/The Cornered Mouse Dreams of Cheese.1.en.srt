Our wedding anniversary's coming up.
How do you celebrate?

2
00:01:36,974 --> 00:01:41,767
I try to find out what she wants
and we eat out together,

3
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:45,475
and I also give her a little something.

4
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:47,767
I hate shopping.

5
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:54,767
I think your wife would enjoy going
to see some theater or something.

6
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:57,600
Or contemporary dance.

7
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,767
How can you tell? Wow, she does like those things.

8
00:02:01,767 --> 00:02:03,058
I thought so.

9
00:02:09,974 --> 00:02:10,974

I work here now.

17
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,230
You're a private eye?

18
00:03:26,814 --> 00:03:30,563
I was surprised to find out my target was you.

19
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,064
You want money?

20
00:03:34,064 --> 00:03:36,855
No, I'm a legit investigator.

21
00:03:36,855 --> 00:03:41,605
But since it was you I sort of felt a twinge,

22
00:03:41,605 --> 00:03:43,147
of conscience, if you will.

23
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,230
You mean, you won't tell?

24
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,397
I'm wavering. It's my job.

25
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,522
Could you cover it up somehow?

26
00:04:00,522 --> 00:04:03,563
Thought you'd say that.

27
00:04:03,563 --> 00:04:05,064
You won't tell?

28
00:04:09,271 --> 00:04:10,480
What should I do?

Your wife, Chikako.

39
00:05:07,563 --> 00:05:11,397
You had a weakness for her type since university.

40
00:05:11,397 --> 00:05:12,563
You think so?

41
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:18,563
Pretty, but cunning. A typically feminine type of girl.

42
00:05:21,064 --> 00:05:22,397
Maybe so.

43
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:28,397
Why did you marry her?

44
00:05:30,188 --> 00:05:31,647
I wonder why.

45
00:05:33,438 --> 00:05:36,563
We'd sort of dated for 2 years, so...

46
00:05:36,563 --> 00:05:38,397
You married for that?

47
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,064
Don't be picky or you'll miss your chance.

48
00:05:43,064 --> 00:05:48,522
Marriage isn't a must, you know.
You haven't changed.

49

Look who's talking.

50
00:06:00,313 --> 00:06:02,647
I want to treat Chikako right.

51
00:06:05,814 --> 00:06:08,730
What I'm doing doesn't make sense.

52
00:06:10,522 --> 00:06:14,563
But how I feel about one and the other are so different.

53
00:06:17,397 --> 00:06:19,147

You're a man, so you get it, don't you?

55
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,730
Why do you want to treat her right?

56
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,979
Because I love her. Why else?

57
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,979
Do you really?

58
00:06:43,562 --> 00:06:45,395
Not just sort of?

00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:49,728
I do love her.

You won't tell Chikako, will you?

65
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:07,562
You smell like cigarettes.

66
00:08:07,562 --> 00:08:09,478
You quit smoking?

67
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:12,728
Yeah. Because Chikako doesn't like it.

68

Why?

83
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:33,645
Well, I wanted to go see a movie for a change.

84
00:10:33,645 --> 00:10:35,812
And go shopping while we're at it.

85
00:10:39,502 --> 00:10:41,251
There's a movie I want to see.

86
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:43,460
Oh, then let's see it.

00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,626
It's a horror film. You sure?

88
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:46,460
What, a horror?

89
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,043
Sure.

90
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:56,217

00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:25,626
What are you doing?

97
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,126
- Why?
- Did you break up with her?

98
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:37,793
Your wife will find proof on her own
and accuse us of doing a sloppy job.

99
00:12:40,502 --> 00:12:42,126
Are you still tailing me?

100
00:12:42,126 --> 00:12:45,001
I told your wife that you weren't cheating.

101
00:12:45,001 --> 00:12:47,376
But she told me to keep investigating.

102
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,876
I'll stop cheating.

103
00:12:54,876 --> 00:13:00,126
Then go back and tell her now.
Or you could text her from here.

104
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:02,460
How could I do that?

105
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,793
You're having an affair and will choose
your wife if it surfaces.

106
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:12,208
It'll be cruel no matter how you break up with her.

107
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:18,375
You're right, but she...

108
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,041
I mean...

109
00:13:22,874 --> 00:13:26,708
She said she didn't mind.
She doesn't care if I'm married.

110
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,791
How do you say no to something like that?

111
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:36,958
That's all there is between us.
And I've only been here 3 times.

112
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,291
I won't see her anymore.

113
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,375
But how will she feel if I text her now?

114
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,625

- Why?

116
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:05,958

Hey, just kissing, right?

119
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,375
I didn't say where.

00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:31,124
Nothing, just letting you know.

00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:36,553
That way you sit there waiting for me
to say something,

188
00:22:40,553 --> 00:22:42,137
is so repulsive.

191
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
Yes?

192
00:23:19,953 --> 00:23:21,619
Did you know?

193
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:24,120
Know what?

194
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,244
The reason why Chikako hired you.

195
00:23:27,244 --> 00:23:28,286
The reason?

196
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,536
Sorry. I'll call you again.

197

198

Never mind.

199
00:23:42,536 --> 00:23:45,619

You called because something happened.

204
00:23:58,661 --> 00:24:00,286
I said, never mind.

205
00:24:00,286 --> 00:24:02,369
Did she ask for a divorce?

206

None of your business.

Are you separating?

208
00:24:11,786 --> 00:24:13,203
Yeah.

209
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:15,162
I see.

210
00:24:16,078 --> 00:24:19,286
So you're getting a divorce.

211
00:24:19,286 --> 00:24:21,786
Then my investigation is really over.

That's deep.

222
00:25:38,219 --> 00:25:40,885
Right. Their difficult sides are cute.

223

224
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,261
- Of course I know.
- No way!

225
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,675

Want to come in?

229
00:26:53,717 --> 00:26:56,883
You must be sick of living alone by now.

230

Nah, I've been hanging loose. No one to fuss over.

231

00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,883

Why would I go out with a guy?

You're right.

239

Then let's go out for drinks sometimes.

240

- I just can.

372
00:45:13,974 --> 00:45:15,188
I'll get it this time.

373
00:45:15,974 --> 00:45:16,974
Here.

374
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:21,641
I can tell from behind, too.

375
00:45:23,557 --> 00:45:25,308
Hold on.

376
00:45:25,308 --> 00:45:27,224
What are you doing?

377
00:45:29,515 --> 00:45:33,474
Whoa, whoa, stop. I can't stand this.

378
00:45:45,724 --> 00:45:48,141
Don't you have a new girlfriend?

379
00:45:48,141 --> 00:45:49,557
Nope.

380
00:45:49,557 --> 00:45:51,474
What? Really?

381
00:45:51,474 --> 00:45:52,682
What about you?

382
00:45:52,682 --> 00:45:55,141
Nobody at all.

383
00:45:55,141 --> 00:45:56,807
Introduce me to someone.

384
00:45:56,807 --> 00:45:57,807
Kyoichi?

385
00:46:00,981 --> 00:46:01,981
Natsuki?

386
00:46:03,315 --> 00:46:06,106
- Wow, it's been so long.
- Long time no see.

387
00:46:07,356 --> 00:46:10,398
It's so like you to be divorced.

388
00:46:12,106 --> 00:46:14,814
Did the easy samurai cheat a lot?

389
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:16,273
Easy samurai?

390
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,064
Brings back memories, huh?

391
00:46:18,064 --> 00:46:20,356
Yeah, it does.

392
00:46:22,523 --> 00:46:27,273
Do you still see anyone from back then?
I went to Asami's wedding.

393
00:46:27,273 --> 00:46:29,523
Oh, Asami got married?

394
00:46:30,398 --> 00:46:33,856
I drink with Yoshikawa and Tsuchida sometimes.

395
00:46:33,856 --> 00:46:35,814
Oh, let me join you.

396
00:46:35,814 --> 00:46:38,315
OK, I'll let you know next time.

397
00:46:38,315 --> 00:46:40,606
Hey? Natsuki?

398
00:46:42,773 --> 00:46:46,064
Imagase! It's been so long! How are you?

399
00:46:46,064 --> 00:46:47,190
Long time no see.

400
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,523
Mr. Otomo.

401
00:46:52,489 --> 00:46:53,780
Long time no see.

402
00:46:54,814 --> 00:46:56,190
Yeah, hi.

403
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:58,482
May we join you? I'm with a friend.

404
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,523
Sure, of course.

405
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:06,939
Hello, I'm Takasugi. I've been friends
with Imagase for a long time.

406
00:47:06,939 --> 00:47:08,606
Sorry for intruding.

407
00:47:08,606 --> 00:47:09,689
No problem.

408
00:47:11,355 --> 00:47:12,521
You just got here?

409
00:47:12,521 --> 00:47:13,729
Yes.

410
00:47:13,729 --> 00:47:15,355
What will you drink?

411
00:47:15,355 --> 00:47:17,313
So you're Mr. Otomo.

412
00:47:19,404 --> 00:47:22,529
I've heard a lot about you.

413
00:47:25,605 --> 00:47:28,522
Are you still going out with Mr. Otomo?

414
00:47:28,522 --> 00:47:32,439
No way! We happened to run into each other recently.

415
00:47:34,104 --> 00:47:36,104
You're still as pretty as ever.

416
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:39,313
Oh, stop that. I've changed a lot.

417
00:47:39,313 --> 00:47:41,647
Not at all. Are you married?

418
00:47:41,647 --> 00:47:43,355
Nope. No prospects, either.

419
00:47:43,355 --> 00:47:44,521
I see.

420
00:47:45,771 --> 00:47:46,912
What about you?

421
00:47:48,188 --> 00:47:50,021
I'm...

422
00:47:52,188 --> 00:47:54,771
trying to make someone I adore love me back.

423
00:47:56,771 --> 00:47:59,021
What's this person like?

424
00:47:59,021 --> 00:48:01,021
- May I smoke?
- Go ahead.

425
00:49:18,827 --> 00:49:21,203
You unlocked my phone again, didn't you?

426
00:49:24,812 --> 00:49:26,521
You went through my texts.

427
00:49:28,261 --> 00:49:31,052
Why are you seeing Natsuki again?

428
00:49:31,052 --> 00:49:32,681
And you? What's with him?

429
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:35,722
I hadn't seen him in a while and he called, so.

430
00:49:36,761 --> 00:49:38,969
You're a better match with him.

431
00:49:50,052 --> 00:49:51,052
Stop it!

432
00:49:53,969 --> 00:49:56,719
I don't care who you see or what you do.

433
00:49:59,124 --> 00:50:04,624
But I did feel that you and he are pals
who belong in a different world.

434
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:16,969
Sorry. That was harsh.

435
00:50:48,219 --> 00:50:51,511
Imagase and his friend had things to do and left.

436
00:50:51,511 --> 00:50:53,386
Oh.

437
00:50:53,386 --> 00:50:55,052
They said it was nice meeting you.

438
00:50:59,393 --> 00:51:02,017
Imagase has become even more attractive.

439
00:51:04,177 --> 00:51:06,136
Yeah, I guess.

440
00:51:09,969 --> 00:51:14,886
You know what? I think
he was in love with you back then.

441
00:51:14,886 --> 00:51:17,469
Huh? Why?

442
00:51:17,469 --> 00:51:21,010
I always noticed him looking this way.

443
00:51:22,219 --> 00:51:25,302
I thought maybe he was in love with me,

444
00:51:26,636 --> 00:51:29,010
but that lighter gave it away.

445
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:30,761
Lighter?

446
00:51:30,761 --> 00:51:35,953
Remember we argued because you were
using a lighter you got from an ex?

447
00:51:36,678 --> 00:51:38,010
No, did we?

448
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:42,553
A pink Zippo. It had gift from a woman
written all over it.

449
00:51:43,636 --> 00:51:45,803
You don't remember?

450
00:51:46,577 --> 00:51:50,076
You gave it to Imagase because he said he wanted it.

451
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,202
He's still using it.

452
00:51:56,035 --> 00:51:59,035
Oh. Guess he hangs on to stuff.

453
00:52:07,118 --> 00:52:08,118
Thank you.

454
00:52:09,452 --> 00:52:10,535
See you.

455
00:52:11,952 --> 00:52:13,577
I'll get off here too.

456
00:52:13,577 --> 00:52:15,619
It's OK, I'll be fine.

457
00:52:17,869 --> 00:52:19,869
- Here's your change.
- Thank you.

458
00:52:22,535 --> 00:52:25,869
See, you're not OK.

459
00:52:28,827 --> 00:52:31,035
- Natsuki.
- What?

460
00:52:31,035 --> 00:52:32,452
Long time no see.

461
00:52:32,452 --> 00:52:36,535
Yeah, yeah. Come on, where's your key?

462
00:52:42,285 --> 00:52:45,118
Why did you drink so much?

463
00:52:45,118 --> 00:52:46,285
Hey?

464
00:52:46,285 --> 00:52:47,535
Where?

465
00:52:47,535 --> 00:52:50,368
- My bag.
- Where in your bag?

466
00:52:50,368 --> 00:52:51,368
I don't know.

467
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:55,785
Come on, look for it. It's in your bag, right?

468
00:52:55,785 --> 00:52:56,952
Welcome back.

469
00:52:59,744 --> 00:53:03,452
Oh, you're home.

470
00:53:03,452 --> 00:53:07,452
I thought you took off somewhere with that guy.

471
00:53:08,535 --> 00:53:11,535
You're so drunk. Are you all right?

472
00:53:11,535 --> 00:53:13,202
Up you go.

473
00:53:19,035 --> 00:53:23,202
Thank you for bringing him home.
Won't you come in?

474
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:27,869
No... It's kind of late...

475
00:53:27,869 --> 00:53:30,118
Good night, then.

476
00:54:18,608 --> 00:54:20,150
Back in university,

477
00:54:22,483 --> 00:54:25,983
I thought you disliked me to be honest.

478
00:54:53,566 --> 00:54:55,400
Is this biting?

479
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,566
Can I pull it out?

480
00:55:01,858 --> 00:55:03,566
We really got one!

481
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:05,608
- No way!
- There are really fish in here.

482
00:55:13,431 --> 00:55:14,431
Hello?

483
00:55:21,775 --> 00:55:26,150
Got it. Yeah. See you.

484
00:55:28,441 --> 00:55:29,733
Natsuki?

485
00:55:29,733 --> 00:55:32,983
Yeah. I'm seeing her tonight.

486
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,400
Oh.

487
00:55:39,316 --> 00:55:40,483
You OK with it?

488
00:55:41,817 --> 00:55:42,983
Go ahead.

489
00:55:55,316 --> 00:55:58,191
- Finally, you're here.
- Sorry.

490
00:55:58,191 --> 00:55:59,650
Have you decided what to eat?

491
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:02,876
- You made no reservation?
- No, I asked you to decide.

492
00:56:31,858 --> 00:56:33,067
I'm home.

493
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,316
You're home early.

494
00:56:51,109 --> 00:56:53,067
Yeah, I guess.

495
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,983
Hey, where's my room wear?

496
00:57:06,025 --> 00:57:07,233
You perv.

497
00:57:07,233 --> 00:57:09,316
You're not drunk today.

498
00:57:10,606 --> 00:57:11,731
What's your point?

499
00:57:11,731 --> 00:57:13,982
What did Natsuki want?

500
00:57:13,982 --> 00:57:15,731
Nothing.

501
00:57:15,731 --> 00:57:16,898
Oh.

502
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,898
I'm going for a walk.

503
00:57:33,898 --> 00:57:34,940
Be back soon.

504
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:03,497
I'm so scared.

505
00:59:04,413 --> 00:59:08,373
Summoned by a persistent gay guy...
What will happen to me?

506
00:59:08,373 --> 00:59:12,122
Hey, you're looking for a fight,
so I'm the one who's scared.

507
00:59:13,538 --> 00:59:17,830
You used to lend an ear whenever
I wanted to talk about Kyoichi.

508
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:21,331
You did that on purpose.
You knew how I felt about him.

509
00:59:22,497 --> 00:59:26,247
You feigned sympathy but always tried to break us up.

510
00:59:30,414 --> 00:59:31,747
Excuse me!

511
00:59:35,747 --> 00:59:37,164
Welcome.

512
00:59:37,164 --> 00:59:39,914
- Singha, please.
- I'll have a Carlsberg.

513
00:59:39,914 --> 00:59:41,414
Certainly.

514
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,747
- I'll buy. What do you want?
- I'll pay for myself.

515
00:59:46,747 --> 00:59:47,830
Yeah?

516
00:59:53,538 --> 00:59:54,997
Leave him alone.

517
01:00:02,206 --> 01:00:03,914
Here you go.

518
01:00:10,747 --> 01:00:13,830
Excuse me. This and this, please.

519
01:00:15,414 --> 01:00:16,830
Certainly.

520
01:00:20,331 --> 01:00:22,872
It took me a long time to get here.

521
01:00:22,872 --> 01:00:25,081
I'm pretty much at the end of my rope.

522
01:00:25,081 --> 01:00:26,664
How long have you liked him?

523
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:28,747
Since the day we met.

524
01:00:28,747 --> 01:00:30,580
What's so great about him?

525
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:32,206
Is there ever a reason?

526
01:00:33,664 --> 01:00:35,331
8 years, huh?

527
01:00:36,247 --> 01:00:39,664
It must have been so hard. You did well.

528
01:00:43,763 --> 01:00:47,013
If you continue, it'll just cause you more pain.

529
01:00:47,937 --> 01:00:49,937
Give it up and free yourself.

530
01:00:54,738 --> 01:01:00,113
Kyoichi is like a rat
that willingly follows the Pied Piper.

531
01:01:01,263 --> 01:01:03,929
I can't let him drown in a gutter.

532
01:01:09,138 --> 01:01:10,263
A gutter?

533
01:01:11,637 --> 01:01:12,679
A gutter.

534
01:01:14,188 --> 01:01:15,604
Welcome.

535
01:01:25,596 --> 01:01:26,929
What are you doing?

536
01:01:28,513 --> 01:01:30,513
Why did you tell her to come see you?

537
01:01:33,263 --> 01:01:38,346
I called him. I figured we'd make
more progress if we were all involved.

538
01:01:46,472 --> 01:01:48,346
Did you tell her anything weird?

539
01:01:52,138 --> 01:01:53,513
Speak up.

540
01:01:55,145 --> 01:01:56,603
What do mean, weird?

541
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:06,763
Hey, since you're here, decide now.

542
01:02:06,763 --> 01:02:11,472
Me or Imagase? Which will you take home tonight?

543
01:02:11,472 --> 01:02:12,513
Huh?

544
01:02:14,346 --> 01:02:15,679
What, all of a sudden?

545
01:02:19,353 --> 01:02:20,353
Welcome.

546
01:02:21,263 --> 01:02:23,280
Oh, a Carlsberg.

547
01:02:24,846 --> 01:02:25,929
Come on.

548
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:33,096
Don't tell me you can't decide.

549
01:02:33,888 --> 01:02:35,763
What the hell is this?

550
01:02:38,829 --> 01:02:42,829
Do you understand? I'm a woman and he's a man.

551
01:02:45,378 --> 01:02:46,586
I know that.

552
01:02:51,703 --> 01:02:53,287
Here you go.

553
01:02:59,662 --> 01:03:01,412
How far have you two gone?

554
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:05,079
Wait, never mind, don't tell me.

555
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:14,829
You're being swayed by him, Kyoichi.

556
01:03:16,329 --> 01:03:19,162
If you don't bail now, it'll be too late.

557
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:24,212
You corner him so relentlessly.
How typically feminine.

558
01:03:24,212 --> 01:03:28,462
Men will die if you don't leave a way out.
Especially his type.

559
01:03:31,037 --> 01:03:37,120
You can't forget him because
you gave him your virginity, right?

560
01:03:41,662 --> 01:03:46,496
How about you? What was your
first experience like? I'm curious.

561
01:03:46,496 --> 01:03:47,995
Stop it.

562
01:03:47,995 --> 01:03:49,787
Do you know?

563
01:03:49,787 --> 01:03:51,329
Why should I know?

564
01:03:51,329 --> 01:03:55,162
An older kid in my high school club
kept me after school...

565
01:03:55,162 --> 01:03:57,037
- A guy?
- Of course.

566
01:03:57,912 --> 01:04:00,496
And he did me from behind in the shower.

567
01:04:00,496 --> 01:04:01,662
Stop it!

568
01:04:04,961 --> 01:04:07,044
I don't want to hear it.

569
01:04:15,461 --> 01:04:17,127
What the hell is this?

570
01:04:30,752 --> 01:04:31,835
I...

571
01:04:34,877 --> 01:04:36,752
can't choose you.

572
01:04:40,544 --> 01:04:42,835
A straight guy can't handle it.

573
01:04:46,461 --> 01:04:47,586
You get it, don't you?

574
01:05:10,127 --> 01:05:11,127
Yes.

575
01:05:21,628 --> 01:05:23,294
And there's our answer.

576
01:05:31,503 --> 01:05:32,503
Let's go.

577
01:05:41,127 --> 01:05:43,378
- Ring it up, please.
- Thank you.

578
01:06:27,018 --> 01:06:30,060
I don't want to hurt him.

579
01:06:36,351 --> 01:06:39,560
I'm not sure why I feel this way,

580
01:06:42,268 --> 01:06:43,643
and I'm confused.

581
01:06:46,810 --> 01:06:48,310
What are you saying?

582
01:06:53,018 --> 01:06:55,769
That's your excuse for not getting it up?

583
01:07:05,101 --> 01:07:06,560
What a joke.

584
01:07:20,727 --> 01:07:23,060
Have you really loved someone?

585
01:07:36,334 --> 01:07:37,417
I'll go now.

586
01:08:05,626 --> 01:08:06,668
I'm home.

587
01:08:21,626 --> 01:08:22,626
A movie?

588
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:25,959
Yeah.

589
01:08:39,042 --> 01:08:40,876
Please have sex with me.

590
01:08:47,459 --> 01:08:49,376
If you reject me this time,

591
01:08:53,209 --> 01:08:54,959
I'll never touch you again.

592
01:09:15,042 --> 01:09:17,626
Just say no and this will all end.

593
01:09:23,042 --> 01:09:25,626
That's why people take advantage of you.

594
01:12:13,633 --> 01:12:14,633
I'm coming.

595
01:12:15,793 --> 01:12:16,793
I'm coming.

596
01:12:55,548 --> 01:12:57,173
The bath's ready.

597
01:12:59,589 --> 01:13:00,923
I'll go, then.

598
01:13:04,048 --> 01:13:05,923
Shall I wash your hair?

599
01:13:15,589 --> 01:13:19,173
No, let me take a bath by myself.

600
01:13:24,972 --> 01:13:26,638
I'll make lunch.

601
01:14:06,522 --> 01:14:08,189
Aren't you moving in?

602
01:14:09,855 --> 01:14:10,855
Why?

603
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,321
Your rent's going to waste.

604
01:14:14,688 --> 01:14:15,688
Yeah.

605
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:24,605
Do you know what day next Saturday is?

606
01:14:31,730 --> 01:14:35,438
The day Mr. Wataru Imagase turns 27 years old.

607
01:14:39,396 --> 01:14:40,855
Is there anything you want?

608
01:14:44,855 --> 01:14:46,022
Come on, tell me.

609
01:15:02,438 --> 01:15:04,522
I want to eat Peking duck.

610
01:15:08,355 --> 01:15:09,855
Ms. Okamura.

611
01:15:12,189 --> 01:15:13,980
Do you know much about wines?

612
01:15:16,355 --> 01:15:18,022
Not really.

613
01:15:18,022 --> 01:15:22,522
I want to get a birth year bottle for a friend.

614
01:15:22,522 --> 01:15:24,939
But I know nothing about wines.

615
01:15:30,189 --> 01:15:35,980
I have a friend who's into wines,
so I'll ask her to make a list by tomorrow.

616
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:37,855
- Oh, I appreciate it.
- Sure.

617
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,189
Thank you.

618
01:15:40,022 --> 01:15:42,189
Your girlfriend?

619
01:15:42,189 --> 01:15:45,438
Well, not a girlfriend...

620
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:09,355
Here.

621
01:16:10,737 --> 01:16:11,904
What?

622
01:16:11,904 --> 01:16:14,321
What? It's your birthday.

623
01:16:14,321 --> 01:16:15,870
Look, it's past midnight.

624
01:16:20,570 --> 01:16:24,196
Oh, I made reservations for Peking duck tomorrow.

625
01:16:24,196 --> 01:16:29,154
But just that is kind of, you know,
so it's a bonus. A surprise.

626
01:16:30,862 --> 01:16:31,862
Here.

627
01:16:36,279 --> 01:16:37,487
Thank you so much.

628
01:16:44,153 --> 01:16:47,321
You splurged! Why?

629
01:16:47,321 --> 01:16:51,404
Yeah? That's amazing you can tell just by looking.

630
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:55,154
- I'm not opening it.
- What? Let's drink it.

631
01:16:55,154 --> 01:16:56,987
It'll be all gone then.

632
01:16:57,987 --> 01:16:59,820
I'll give you another next year.

633
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:01,987
OK then?

634
01:17:04,744 --> 01:17:08,994
Oh, forgot to buy snacks. Do we still have prosciutto?

635
01:17:13,363 --> 01:17:15,404
Is there any left over?

636
01:17:28,862 --> 01:17:32,154
[Ms. Okamura]

637
01:17:52,154 --> 01:17:53,654
Sorry, hang on a sec.

638
01:17:55,654 --> 01:17:56,654
Good evening.

639
01:17:57,487 --> 01:17:58,570
Good evening.

640
01:17:58,570 --> 01:17:59,654
This is it.

641
01:17:59,654 --> 01:18:00,654
Thanks.

642
01:18:01,321 --> 01:18:03,695
- I'll check it ASAP.
- Please do.

643
01:18:03,695 --> 01:18:05,945
Today's your day off, right?

644
01:18:05,945 --> 01:18:07,112
Yes.

645
01:18:07,112 --> 01:18:08,475
Was it all right?

646
01:18:08,475 --> 01:18:09,783
It's all right.

647
01:18:10,487 --> 01:18:14,279
Really? So you're just going home now?

648
01:18:14,279 --> 01:18:16,154
Don't worry about it.

649
01:18:16,154 --> 01:18:17,237
You sure?

650
01:18:19,029 --> 01:18:20,071
Good evening.

651
01:18:22,029 --> 01:18:23,112
Good evening.

652
01:18:24,363 --> 01:18:25,820
He's a friend.

653
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:30,567
I work under Mr. Otomo. My name is Okamura.

654
01:18:30,567 --> 01:18:34,149
Ms. Okamura. I'm Imagase. Hope Kyoichi is a nice boss.

655
01:18:36,985 --> 01:18:41,027
Um, this is cheesecake. Please enjoy them together.

656
01:18:42,152 --> 01:18:43,819
- Thanks.
- You sure?

657
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:45,569
- Of course.
- Thanks.

658
01:18:47,319 --> 01:18:49,319
I'll go home now, then.

659
01:18:49,319 --> 01:18:50,486
Thank you again.

660
01:18:52,152 --> 01:18:53,236
Excuse me.

661
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:02,701
Couldn't it wait 'till Monday?

662
01:19:02,701 --> 01:19:05,035
I have to check it before then.

663
01:19:05,985 --> 01:19:08,652
What did she intend with that cheesecake?

664
01:19:08,652 --> 01:19:09,735
Intend?

665
01:19:09,735 --> 01:19:15,152
Maybe she wanted you to invite her over
to eat it with you.

666
01:19:16,152 --> 01:19:18,027
That can't be true.

667
01:19:18,027 --> 01:19:21,152
She's just always considerate.

668
01:19:21,152 --> 01:19:22,236
Oh?

669
01:19:24,528 --> 01:19:26,902
Let's go eat Peking duck.

670
01:19:32,311 --> 01:19:33,478
What?

671
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:35,860
Where's the restaurant?

672
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:37,277
Nearby.

673
01:19:43,361 --> 01:19:44,735
I'm starving.

674
01:20:31,402 --> 01:20:34,569
It's hard to tell the value of antiques.

675
01:20:35,402 --> 01:20:39,236
- The internet makes it so easy to...
- You're right.

676
01:20:39,236 --> 01:20:40,361
Otomo.

677
01:20:48,528 --> 01:20:53,402
You saw us together this morning, didn't you?

678
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:56,277
What did you think?

679
01:20:58,693 --> 01:21:01,735
Nothing much, sir.

680
01:21:02,444 --> 01:21:04,486
That I'm thoughtless for my age?

681
01:21:04,486 --> 01:21:05,444
No.

682
01:21:05,444 --> 01:21:08,569
An old man mad about a young woman, huh?

683
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:15,610
People are free to do what they want.

684
01:21:19,505 --> 01:21:21,088
Free, huh?

685
01:21:23,275 --> 01:21:25,609
Tamaki is my daughter.

686
01:21:27,109 --> 01:21:28,109
What?

687
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:35,658
Didn't want you to misunderstand.

688
01:21:35,658 --> 01:21:39,491
I had no idea she was your daughter.

689
01:21:43,150 --> 01:21:45,734
I trust you to keep this to yourself.

690
01:21:46,526 --> 01:21:47,526
Yes.

691
01:21:49,317 --> 01:21:54,359
I have a mistress, you see, and Tamaki is her daughter.

692
01:21:56,234 --> 01:21:57,234
Oh.

693
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:01,651
I didn't pull any strings.

694
01:22:02,817 --> 01:22:06,817
She joined the company on her own to surprise me.

695
01:22:11,192 --> 01:22:16,401
She's the apple of my eye.

696
01:22:19,150 --> 01:22:23,984
Whenever I see her nowadays,
all she talks about is you.

697
01:23:18,359 --> 01:23:19,858
How long will you be gone?

698
01:23:19,858 --> 01:23:21,900
I'll be back in 4 or 5 days.

699
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:23,984
OK, you watch yourself.

700
01:23:26,651 --> 01:23:28,359
Get me pears from Yamagata.

701
01:23:28,359 --> 01:23:30,734
- You like them?
- Yeah.

702
01:23:31,817 --> 01:23:36,150
Western pears are shaped like women, don't you think?

703
01:23:36,150 --> 01:23:37,275
You think so?

704
01:23:39,686 --> 01:23:43,102
Want to return to your normal self and sleep with women?

705
01:23:44,315 --> 01:23:45,982
Why do you say stuff like that?

706
01:23:59,858 --> 01:24:04,482
I used to think I wanted to be your cigarette
back in university.

707
01:24:06,524 --> 01:24:09,858
I was jealous of the cigarettes between your fingers.

708
01:24:17,732 --> 01:24:19,399
You're such a fool.

709
01:24:25,858 --> 01:24:28,774
[Funeral]

710
01:25:07,982 --> 01:25:09,107
Ms. Okamura.

711
01:25:20,315 --> 01:25:21,732
I'm OK.

712
01:25:23,399 --> 01:25:27,732
It's odd for a low-level employee
to be crying this much.

713
01:25:30,149 --> 01:25:35,566
I know it's odd for me to be
standing here for so long too, but...

714
01:25:37,899 --> 01:25:39,482
I don't feel like leaving.

715
01:26:42,281 --> 01:26:44,614
What? It's work.

716
01:26:44,614 --> 01:26:46,489
I didn't say anything.

717
01:26:47,322 --> 01:26:48,447
Oh.

718
01:26:58,572 --> 01:26:59,656
So this is it.

719
01:26:59,656 --> 01:27:02,114
- It's great.
- Thank you.

720
01:27:02,114 --> 01:27:04,114
- Let's work together again.
- Thank you.

721
01:27:10,155 --> 01:27:15,447
Could we move these and
add 3 rows of glasses instead?

722
01:27:15,447 --> 01:27:18,281
- Yes, of course.
- Really? Thank you!

723
01:27:19,656 --> 01:27:20,781
I appreciate it.

724
01:27:25,531 --> 01:27:27,364
That was a lot of overtime.

725
01:27:27,364 --> 01:27:28,948
Yes it was.

726
01:27:28,948 --> 01:27:30,114
Tired?

727
01:27:30,114 --> 01:27:33,531
I'm fine. I'm tougher than I look.

728
01:27:33,531 --> 01:27:34,656
You are?

729
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:35,656
Yes.

730
01:27:36,948 --> 01:27:38,281
I'm so hungry.

731
01:27:53,656 --> 01:27:54,864
That's a secret.

732
01:27:54,864 --> 01:27:56,114
Why?

733
01:29:23,281 --> 01:29:27,197
You're home late. Who were you with?

734
01:29:27,906 --> 01:29:29,698
Why? It was work.

735
01:29:31,496 --> 01:29:32,955
With Tamaki Okamura?

736
01:29:34,955 --> 01:29:38,454
Yeah. She works under me.

737
01:29:38,454 --> 01:29:42,996
The cheesecake girl, right?
The late managing director's daughter.

738
01:29:44,621 --> 01:29:48,246
She did give off sort of a know-nothing, well-off vibe.

739
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:52,413
You inferred that just by meeting her?

740
01:30:06,538 --> 01:30:08,746
You think I'm a nuisance, don't you?

741
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,274
Am I in your way?

742
01:30:13,955 --> 01:30:14,955
Why?

743
01:30:16,246 --> 01:30:20,287
Why didn't you take your mourning suit to the cleaners?

744
01:30:22,996 --> 01:30:26,246
Was it on purpose? Wanted me to take a hint?

745
01:30:26,246 --> 01:30:27,246
What?

746
01:30:27,246 --> 01:30:29,329
Smudged with make-up.

747
01:30:30,628 --> 01:30:32,920
This stain is unthinkable!

748
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:38,878
She and I aren't involved.

749
01:30:40,586 --> 01:30:44,391
Her father died. It's only natural that I support her.

750
01:30:44,391 --> 01:30:45,962
Is it?

751
01:30:47,962 --> 01:30:50,212
Not because you're involved?

752
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:52,212
Stop it.

753
01:30:52,212 --> 01:30:53,962
- Have you done it?
- We haven't.

754
01:30:53,962 --> 01:30:57,045
- Tell me the truth.
- It's not like that!

755
01:31:09,461 --> 01:31:11,045
You're not the one for me.

756
01:31:15,102 --> 01:31:17,102
And I'm not the one for you.

757
01:31:19,545 --> 01:31:20,836
What the hell?

758
01:31:32,378 --> 01:31:33,795
Are you serious?

759
01:31:37,711 --> 01:31:38,711
Yes.

760
01:31:51,461 --> 01:31:52,628
You're right.

761
01:31:56,711 --> 01:31:59,461
If you say so, then it must be so.

762
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:21,170
Let's call it quits.

763
01:32:43,227 --> 01:32:45,102
You've been in pain for so long.

764
01:33:32,102 --> 01:33:37,810
I think someone like you should go out
with a woman who comes over

765
01:33:37,810 --> 01:33:42,144
and cooks something that takes
a long time simmering on the stove.

766
01:33:44,727 --> 01:33:46,061
What do you mean?

767
01:33:46,061 --> 01:33:48,560
A woman like that suits you.

768
01:33:49,810 --> 01:33:51,810
You think so?

769
01:33:58,061 --> 01:33:59,227
You should...

770
01:34:01,353 --> 01:34:04,311
date someone more affectionate next time.

771
01:34:06,227 --> 01:34:07,894
Affectionate?

772
01:34:12,186 --> 01:34:14,560
Someone who treats you better...

773
01:34:16,477 --> 01:34:18,311
and loves you more.

774
01:34:22,186 --> 01:34:24,311
Someone who loves me, huh?

775
01:34:28,144 --> 01:34:30,394
That's so like you.

776
01:35:53,842 --> 01:35:56,092
Do you smoke?

777
01:35:59,509 --> 01:36:03,384
No, the person who moved out left it behind.

778
01:36:04,467 --> 01:36:06,800
Asked me to at least keep it.

779
01:36:09,384 --> 01:36:11,925
As if I'd ever forget my ex without it.

780
01:36:20,842 --> 01:36:23,377
A woman who smokes...

781
01:36:23,377 --> 01:36:25,410
I wonder what she's like.

782
01:36:26,467 --> 01:36:31,800
Cool and mature, probably. But actually
the type who needs company.

783
01:36:39,842 --> 01:36:42,592
Sorry for trying to picture her.

784
01:37:01,592 --> 01:37:03,551
Why did it end?

785
01:37:10,342 --> 01:37:13,551
Told me I wasn't the one and that was it.

786
01:37:16,342 --> 01:37:18,509
Seemed to be in a lot of pain.

787
01:37:21,467 --> 01:37:23,342
Even though I was happy.

788
01:37:26,509 --> 01:37:27,967
I'm so selfish.

789
01:37:30,399 --> 01:37:32,773
I should have said goodbye long ago.

790
01:37:38,099 --> 01:37:40,224
Forgive me for being so nosy.

791
01:37:41,807 --> 01:37:45,474
But I don't want to make the same mistake as your ex.

792
01:38:19,890 --> 01:38:20,890
Come here.

793
01:38:40,224 --> 01:38:43,140
When you fall in love too deeply,

794
01:38:46,724 --> 01:38:50,349
you can't hold yourself together and you fall apart.

795
01:39:10,557 --> 01:39:12,224
Welcome.

796
01:39:14,474 --> 01:39:15,807
A highball, please.

797
01:39:15,807 --> 01:39:17,140
Sure, 700 yen.

798
01:39:24,307 --> 01:39:25,307
Over here.

799
01:39:32,974 --> 01:39:35,391
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

800
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:53,182
Hi there. Hey.

801
01:39:53,182 --> 01:39:55,724
- Hey, you meeting someone?
- No.

802
01:39:55,724 --> 01:39:58,015
- Come here often?
- First time.

803
01:39:58,015 --> 01:40:01,015
Oh. Let's drink together. Cheers.

804
01:40:01,015 --> 01:40:02,015
Cheers!

805
01:40:02,807 --> 01:40:04,557
What's with him?

806
01:40:05,307 --> 01:40:07,557
Want to drink with us?

807
01:40:57,807 --> 01:41:00,224
You OK? Did something happen?

808
01:41:03,182 --> 01:41:04,265
What's wrong?

809
01:41:10,516 --> 01:41:11,641
I'm sorry.

810
01:41:13,474 --> 01:41:14,557
What's wrong?

811
01:42:23,881 --> 01:42:24,922
What do you think?

812
01:42:25,672 --> 01:42:28,005
- Mom!
- Coming.

813
01:42:30,213 --> 01:42:31,589
Let's see.

814
01:42:38,881 --> 01:42:40,672
Perfect!

815
01:42:43,714 --> 01:42:45,589
- Thanks.
- No problem.

816
01:42:46,422 --> 01:42:51,088
He always fiddled with it when it broke down,

817
01:42:51,088 --> 01:42:55,881
but I guess he never really fixed it. Now it's good.

818
01:42:55,881 --> 01:42:57,088
You're a big help.

819
01:42:57,088 --> 01:42:58,088
Sure.

820
01:42:59,714 --> 01:43:06,088
Oh, I just remembered. There's a jar
with a tight lid. Will you open it?

821
01:43:06,088 --> 01:43:07,088
Of course.

822
01:44:23,338 --> 01:44:25,255
How beautiful!

823
01:44:26,503 --> 01:44:28,837
Thank you.

824
01:44:28,837 --> 01:44:30,170
It's my pleasure.

825
01:44:31,670 --> 01:44:34,587
Let me see it up close.

826
01:44:36,337 --> 01:44:41,670
This is so lovely. I'm so happy for you.

827
01:45:09,337 --> 01:45:10,337
Hey.

828
01:45:11,670 --> 01:45:12,795
Hold it!

829
01:45:17,170 --> 01:45:18,503
Who hired you?

830
01:45:22,503 --> 01:45:25,837
Have you been watching me since we broke up?

831
01:45:25,837 --> 01:45:29,170
No way, I'm busier than you think.

832
01:45:31,211 --> 01:45:32,920
Did you steal my bike?

833
01:45:33,670 --> 01:45:38,920
It was gathering dust, but you noticed?
Don't worry, I'm taking good care of it.

834
01:45:41,503 --> 01:45:44,446
Did you want me to notice you?

835
01:45:44,446 --> 01:45:46,337
You weren't hiding very well.

836
01:45:52,004 --> 01:45:54,004
You probably already know,

837
01:45:56,754 --> 01:45:58,754
but I've decided to get married.

838
01:46:03,844 --> 01:46:05,136
I see.

839
01:46:10,677 --> 01:46:15,219
You'll make a good couple.
Don't worry, I won't get in your way.

840
01:46:21,178 --> 01:46:22,677
How have you been?

841
01:46:26,510 --> 01:46:28,052
Taking care of yourself?

842
01:46:46,302 --> 01:46:48,719
Please let me be with you.

843
01:46:53,052 --> 01:46:55,886
I don't intend to prevent you from getting married.

844
01:46:55,886 --> 01:47:00,719
Just meet me once a month. Once every 6 months.

845
01:47:03,385 --> 01:47:06,594
I don't want sex. I won't cause you trouble.

846
01:47:08,385 --> 01:47:10,219
I'll do whatever you say.

847
01:47:23,302 --> 01:47:24,343
I don't want you.

848
01:47:33,302 --> 01:47:34,802
I don't want you anymore.

849
01:47:45,901 --> 01:47:47,401
Of course you don't.

850
01:47:49,985 --> 01:47:51,401
You should have...

851
01:47:55,068 --> 01:47:57,734
told me so from the beginning.

852
01:48:33,151 --> 01:48:38,609
I'll make hamburger steak.
Mom gave me tips to make them juicy.

853
01:48:38,609 --> 01:48:40,818
- Oh, what flavor?
- Japanese style OK?

854
01:48:40,818 --> 01:48:42,110
Yeah, sounds good.

855
01:48:57,110 --> 01:48:59,151
You were vacuuming?

856
01:48:59,151 --> 01:49:00,151
Yeah.

857
01:49:02,484 --> 01:49:06,484
Do you make dishes that need
to be simmered for a long time?

858
01:49:07,526 --> 01:49:09,568
What? Simmered?

859
01:49:09,568 --> 01:49:10,568
Yeah.

860
01:49:12,376 --> 01:49:13,750
You like stews?

861
01:49:14,833 --> 01:49:17,750
Well, not exactly.

862
01:49:20,424 --> 01:49:22,757
I'll ask Mom to teach me.

863
01:49:26,250 --> 01:49:29,084
Oh, the curtains arrived.

864
01:49:30,458 --> 01:49:31,458
When?

865
01:49:33,292 --> 01:49:35,376
When did this arrive?

866
01:49:35,376 --> 01:49:37,250
Oh, last week, maybe?

867
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:40,750
I see.

868
01:49:42,084 --> 01:49:43,084
I'll open it.

869
01:49:57,833 --> 01:49:59,458
They did a great job.

870
01:50:01,167 --> 01:50:04,833
I'm glad we decided on your choice of blue.

871
01:50:50,832 --> 01:50:52,250
I'll take them.

872
01:50:52,250 --> 01:50:56,000
It was good. I think I have some puddings. Want some?

873
01:51:03,376 --> 01:51:05,583
I'll make stew next time.

874
01:51:08,167 --> 01:51:09,250
I'll do that.

875
01:51:09,917 --> 01:51:10,917
It's OK.

876
01:51:12,625 --> 01:51:14,376
I'll go home after this.

877
01:51:15,084 --> 01:51:16,792
You're not staying overnight?

878
01:51:16,792 --> 01:51:17,792
No.

879
01:51:20,125 --> 01:51:23,667
I'll walk you to the bus stop. Leave the dishes there.

880
01:52:09,998 --> 01:52:11,123
She went home?

881
01:52:11,123 --> 01:52:13,748
Yeah, she didn't stay overnight.

882
01:52:14,623 --> 01:52:15,623
Come on.

883
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:42,332
What a tacky curtain.

884
01:54:45,306 --> 01:54:46,306
Yeah.

885
01:54:51,681 --> 01:54:53,431
You're such a jerk.

886
01:55:00,855 --> 01:55:05,606
Break up with her while you're at it.

887
01:55:09,847 --> 01:55:11,847
There's no way you could.

888
01:55:13,764 --> 01:55:14,931
I will.

889
01:55:17,979 --> 01:55:18,979
When?

890
01:55:19,847 --> 01:55:20,931
Tomorrow.

891
01:55:22,681 --> 01:55:24,389
Liar. That's not like you.

892
01:55:26,097 --> 01:55:28,764
Just handle it so she never finds out.

893
01:55:37,264 --> 01:55:38,556
You can't do it.

894
01:55:43,431 --> 01:55:44,931
What's with you?

895
01:55:53,245 --> 01:55:55,662
There are things more important in life...

896
01:55:57,447 --> 01:56:00,030
than grappling with romantic matters.

897
01:56:04,697 --> 01:56:06,613
We're both at that age.

898
01:56:17,904 --> 01:56:19,280
Let's live together.

899
01:58:07,754 --> 01:58:08,754
I'm sorry.

900
01:58:13,712 --> 01:58:15,546
My ex came back.

901
01:58:22,129 --> 01:58:23,212
I see.

902
01:58:26,337 --> 01:58:28,212
So she's back.

903
01:58:36,424 --> 01:58:40,007
Are you getting back together?

904
01:58:42,228 --> 01:58:43,228
Yes.

905
01:58:48,436 --> 01:58:50,728
Are you marrying her?

906
01:59:03,686 --> 01:59:04,728
I...

907
01:59:09,895 --> 01:59:11,686
intended to find a way...

908
01:59:16,743 --> 01:59:19,409
to navigate the hard road somehow.

909
01:59:25,561 --> 01:59:27,353
But my ex left again.

910
01:59:32,228 --> 01:59:37,603
Then couldn't I just stay with you like this?

911
01:59:41,228 --> 01:59:45,186
If she shows up again, I'll go away without a fuss.

912
01:59:47,228 --> 01:59:49,144
Is that no longer a possibility?

913
01:59:57,228 --> 01:59:59,061
Why won't you say anything?

914
02:00:02,478 --> 02:00:05,561
Are you thinking of saying something nice?

915
02:00:10,069 --> 02:00:14,861
Since you're breaking up with me anyway,
just say whatever.

916
02:00:16,102 --> 02:00:17,686
Say you dislike me.

917
02:00:27,603 --> 02:00:28,811
I was...

918
02:00:31,519 --> 02:00:33,394
going to keep on like this.

919
02:00:33,394 --> 02:00:36,645
Then I'm perfectly fine with that.

920
02:00:36,645 --> 02:00:38,478
I feel awful about this.

921
02:00:44,311 --> 02:00:45,353
But sorry...

922
02:00:48,728 --> 02:00:50,311
I can't help it.

923
02:00:54,877 --> 02:00:56,044
I'm so sorry.

924
02:01:08,627 --> 02:01:11,127
My ex might not come back this time.

925
02:01:16,711 --> 02:01:18,294
But I want to wait.

926
02:01:21,294 --> 02:01:22,752
By myself.

927
02:01:26,460 --> 02:01:28,252
I want to do what I can.

928
02:01:39,011 --> 02:01:41,510
You believe that she'll come back.

929
02:02:08,060 --> 02:02:11,060
You have a weakness for people who love you,

930
02:02:12,726 --> 02:02:15,601
but don't trust that love in the end,

931
02:02:16,768 --> 02:02:21,726
and sniff around the feelings
of those who approach you.

932
02:02:25,601 --> 02:02:26,601
Right?

933
02:02:29,893 --> 02:02:32,810
I really hate people like that.

934
02:02:35,060 --> 02:02:36,476
Hey, excuse me.

935
02:02:42,851 --> 02:02:44,976
When you really love someone,

936
02:02:46,393 --> 02:02:50,684
it means that person becomes
the exception in everything.

937
02:02:58,143 --> 02:03:00,184
You probably can't understand.

938
02:03:03,393 --> 02:03:04,559
I understand.

939
02:03:26,393 --> 02:03:27,476
I'm sorry.

940
02:03:57,476 --> 02:03:58,768
I'm really grateful.

941
02:04:23,393 --> 02:04:25,393
I really...

942
02:04:28,670 --> 02:04:30,848
loved you so much!

943
02:10:34,523 --> 02:10:39,531
