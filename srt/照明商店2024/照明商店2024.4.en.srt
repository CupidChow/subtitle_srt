00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,474
- Remembered everything, right?
- Yes.

6
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,861
- Hm.
- Okay.

7
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,952
- There's a defect in the coffin.
- Huh?

8
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:44,455
Oh... Oh, we don't have any more left.

9
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,416
- This is the last one?
- Yes.

10
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,295
Well, then.

11
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,175
Let's get her dressed up,
and we'll keep her in the morgue.

12
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,261
By her burial date,
we'll have a different coffin.

13
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,846
Yes, sir. I'll get that done.

14
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,026
Sir?

15
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,110
What?

16
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,653
She's not dead.

17
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,488
She's alive.

18
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,616
The corpse just made a noise.

19
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,035
Don't shout. She'll hear you.

20
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,579
She's deceased, she's not a corpse.

21
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,788
The dead are still people.

22
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,624
Oh.

23
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:30,793
Told you.

24
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,964
That's the sound of built-up gases
escaping from the deceased.

25
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,049
Ah...

26
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,093
Get some fresh air.

27
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,596
Oh! Oh, no...

28
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:45,141
I apologize. I can finish with...

29
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,810
Go rest. We'll finish it later.

30
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,480
Once you've said sorry.

31
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,273
Right.

32
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,570
I beg your pardon for my behavior.

34
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:49,223
Right, now that that's all done,
would you please contact her family?

35
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:50,892
Sure.

36
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,671
Am I dead?

37
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:28,930
Yes.

38
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,730
I can't be dead.

39
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,150
Please tell me I'm not dead.

40
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,699
That's just your regret.

41
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,495
You must pass on in peace.

42
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,082
I can't.

43
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,835
I can't.

44
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,757
Many of those I see...

45
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,301
react just like you.

46
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,679
They too are mourning what they've lost.

47
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:13,724
No. It's not that.

48
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,189
Accepting death is hard.

49
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,776
For a few,
it requires quite a bit of time.

50
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,072
I can't accept it.

51
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,241
I'm not ready.

52
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,872
We all fear the unknown, my dear.

53
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,709
I promise you'll find your peace.

54
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,343
Then...

55
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,054
what happens to me now?

56
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,603
Well, you are going to go
to a better place.

57
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,488
Where am I going?

58
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,493
It's a world...

59
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,246
where everybody can eventually move on.

60
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,379
Now, you please rest.

61
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,549
Once everything's complete,
we'll return for you.

62
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,934
Sir?

63
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,644
It's dark in here.

64
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,397
Soon you'll be in a world that's brighter.

65
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,154
Am I alone?

66
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,075
Yes.

67
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,453
Thank goodness.

68
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,082
Please rest well.

69
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,459
You're going to a better place.

70
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,878
And when you make it there,

71
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,339
you will find comfort, too.

72
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,716
And forget this place.

73
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,220
I'll forget this place?

74
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,055

87
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,748
Floor eight, please.

88
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,708
Oh.

89
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,211
I see.

90
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,470
Excuse me, sir.

91
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,639
Why do you need floor eight?

92
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,685
Visitors are not permitted there at night.

93
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,189
The only thing there
is the intensive care unit.

94
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,149
Oh.

95
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,276
I know because I work there.

96
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:02,406
Do you have... many patients?

97
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,991
What?

98
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,534
The accident...

99
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,870
The critically injured patients.

100
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,042
Do you think they'll wake up?

101
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:16,962
Hmm...

102
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,423
Well...

103
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,676
I'm not sure if they will.

104
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,264
After all, they are critically injured.

105
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,655
Um...

106
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,700
It all depends on their will to live.

107
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,776
Um, sir, you're uh...

108
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,490
Are you okay?

109
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,827
Sir, what's wrong?

110
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,669
Sir, please. Please stop it.

111
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,386
Sir, please.

112
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,972
Please, stop. I'm begging you.

113
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,182
Please, don't...

114
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,444
Sir, don't! Sir, stop...

115
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,574
Sir, please. Please! Help!

116
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,998
Someone... please... help!

117
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,545

- Yeah.
- Evening.

- Nurse Kwon.
- Yeah?

{\an8}TA two.

127
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,791

What brings you here then?

130
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,507
Uh, can you tell me if you saw...

131
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,886
a man about in his mid-30s, 180,
with short, dark hair.

132
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,596
He looks, uh, plain.

133
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,932
Nobody like that.

134
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,143
I know the description doesn't help.

135
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,855
Though, I guess
he couldn't hide in here anyway.

136
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,274
But the suspect does have
one strange quality.

137
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,069
Put him in bright light
and his eyes shine like a cat's.

138
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,160
So, he wasn't here?

139
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,329
Nope, he wasn't here.

140
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,373
And what is it
that brings you to this place?

141
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,086
The store's noticeable
with all these lights on.

142
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,223
No.

143
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,183
I'm not talking about the store.

144
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,895
He was riding a scooter and it was noisy,

145
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:27,439
so I followed the sound
and that's how I found this place.

146
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,151
You didn't hear a scooter come by here?

147
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,779
No, I'm afraid not.

148
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,698
Huh. All right then.

149
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,783
Goodbye.

150
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,621
Why don't you stay a while?
It's raining hard.

151
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,789
It'll be fine.

152
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,625
You don't have an umbrella.

153
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,171
It's the only place
open at this hour.

154
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,384
The one you're looking for
could end up coming around.

155
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,820
Weren't there supposed to be
two TA patients?

156
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,405
What happened to the other?

157
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,449
He's in worse condition.

158
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,327
We're out of ICU units, so he's in Ward 1.

159
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,204
Oh.

160
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,915
We're running of beds
because of that accident.

161
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,085
On top of that,
more and more patients are coming in

162
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,837
and it's getting to be too much to handle.

163
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,921
What do we do?

164
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:37,593
What the hell happened
to the new nurses they said they'd send?

165
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,473
{\an8}Any patients in recovery?

166
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,810
We can move the alcoholic patient
to general, can't we?

167
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:47,895
His status?

168
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,272
I removed the restraints
and lowered the sedatives.

169
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,233
And once his sedatives are complete,
move him to general,

170
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,610
so he won't disturb the others.

171
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,154
- To the general ward.
- Yes, ma'am.

172
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,783
Or he could just quit drinking.

173
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,245
Alcoholics have a disease.

174
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,248
I know. You're right.

175
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,835
I'm just frustrated
'cause we've got so few ICU beds

176
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,046
and we're using them on alcoholics.

177
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,298
And he's been here multiple times, too.

178
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,469
Single rooms
and ICU units are expensive!

179
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,054
Think of what he's doing to his family!

180
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,723
If we discharge him,
he'll come back drunk.

181
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,183
Discharge him again, drunk again.

182
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,018
That's enough.

183
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,940
To us, they're all still patients.

184
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,942
Ma'am.

185
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,742
Take a break.
Go and get some food.

186
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,827
- Thanks.
- Okay.

187
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,005
Um...

188
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,715
If it's okay with you,

189
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,593
could I handle the transfer?

190
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,678
Why?

191
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,389
I was hoping to speak to him.

192
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,809
About what?

193
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:13,397
Well, just about the drunk driver
who ran into me a few years ago.

194
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,150
Why would you want to talk
about those things?

195
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,486
It's what happened after.

196
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,779
Hm?

197
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,700
You know what it is.

198
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,247
Go ahead.

199
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,165
Ma'am.

200
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,087
What is going on here?

201
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,261
Hello.

202
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,973
You've seen me, right?

203
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:50,892
Yeah.

204
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,519
Good evening.

205
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,772
You see me right now?

206
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,025
Uh-huh.

207
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,238
You're... You're my next-door neighbor...

208
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,366
- Are you here to get lights?
- Yeah.

209
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,493
Didn't you also go yesterday?

210
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,955
Yeah.

211
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,749
You buy them often.

212
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,253
I'm helping Mom with errands.

213
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,051
You get back safe then.

214
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,614
I'm so sorry.

215
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,907
I need to quit drinking.

216
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,827
You're getting yourself
in a lot of danger.

217
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,456
Yeah. I know I am.

218
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,749
I'm sorry.

219
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,543
No, you don't.

220
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,631
Alcoholism can cause liver failure,
which can lead to death.

221
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,010
Yeah, death.

222
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,428
You don't recall?

223
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:12,474
You were in and out of consciousness
and saying nonsense.

224
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,394
You were hallucinating something.

225
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,354
Almost like someone was talking to you.

226
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:19,648
You're getting dirt on me!

227
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,857
Go away.

228
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,988
- Who did you see?
- Huh?

229
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,325
Go.

230
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,494
You're getting dirt on me!

231
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,623
Getting dirt on me. Go away.

232
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,293
Who do you think you saw?

233
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,589
You never know who it could be.

234
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,763
Delirium is common
with the critically ill.

235
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,016
So I'm delirious?

236
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,978
Those who get into serious accidents

237
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:01,481
or alcoholics can sometimes have delirium.

238
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:05,318
They often can't think straight,
and they lose short-term memory.

239
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,029
They can't discern people or places,

240
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,867
and they suffer visual
and auditory hallucinations.

241
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,077
That's when the delirium can take them.

242
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,622
The ICU is the border
that straddles life and death.

243
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,542
Many enter and leave through its doors.

244
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,878
Some people leave alive.

245
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,046
Some people leave dead.

246
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:28,467
I wonder who it was you saw.

247
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,763
Sleep well, sir.

248
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,731
Nurse! It's too dark!
Nurse, I'm scared.

249
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,655
I'm scared.

250
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:58,413
Please, nurse. Please.

251
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,472
I've seen him before as well.

252
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,641
The person that you saw.

253
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,227
Huh?

254
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,739
I was once in a serious car accident,

255
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,116
and was sent to the Intensive Care Unit.

256
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,119
Basic traumatic brain injury,
and was unconscious.

257
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,332
I was neither alive,
nor was I really dead.

258
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,336
I also experienced delirium.

259
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,549
I just narrowly survived.

260
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:54,427
When I woke up,
I had a hard time adjusting to things.

261
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,394
And occasionally, ever since,
I keep seeing someone.

262
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,230
Would you mind it if...

263
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,900
if you told me who you see?

264
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,655
Someone I can't be sure is human.

265
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,408
You have to save her somehow!

266
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,035
What do you mean...

267
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,329
you're not sure?

268
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,290
Because you can't tell.

269
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,501
Even looking closely you won't know.

270
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:29,045
If they're human, or they're not.

271
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,048
I get confused, too.

272
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,050
Why are you going to the eight floor?

273
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,137
What do they look like then?

274
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,639
They're a little different.

275
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,767
<i>It's hard to distinguish.</i>

276
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,812
<i>Are they ghosts?</i>

277
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:47,606
I don't know.

278
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,651
However, I do know who it was you saw.

279
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,742
Sir? You can't be in here.

280
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,704
Someone who is not dead,
yet not living anymore.

281
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,290
Where's the morgue?

282
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,875
I didn't realize it at the time.

283
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:10,337
How... How'd he get there?

284
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,922
He was a patient,

285
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,051
unconscious and barely holding on.

286
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,645
<i>That's why I do what I can
to help them live.</i>

287
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:38,823
I heard that they buried you alive
because you owed them too much money.

288
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:43,495
So I think I know why
you were trying to find the morgue.

289
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,459
You thought that you'd end up a burden
to your family, didn't you?

290
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,586
I was that way too.

291
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,675
I wandered around for a long time also.

292
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,927
I wanted to surrender.

293
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:01,763
And then...

294
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,641
I was lucky to have someone
give me the will to live.

295
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,493
And so, I survived.

296
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,830
I'll stay right here, okay?

297
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,832
Better not give up.

298
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,544
I don't know if you can hear me but...

299
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,256
even if you can't...

300
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,342
you must stay strong.

301
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,270
COME BACK TO US, YOUNGJI!

302
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,730
I'll be waiting for you.

303
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,441
The minute you hear me,

304
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,193
if you're ready,
give me a call, all right?

305
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:08,204
PLAYING NOW
WHERE THE WIND COMES FROM

306
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,751
If you've seen someone
who's on the border of life and death,

307
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,377
then that means

308
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,630
that you yourself are on the border
of life and death as well.

309
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,426
If you keep seeing them
as often as you do,

310
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,470
who knows what'll happen?

311
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:27,640
So, seriously, I'm begging you.

312
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,893
Take care of yourself.

313
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:38,985
Seriously,
what the heck is going on around here?

314
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,153
Oh.

315
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,489
Good evening.

316
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:48,077
Sheesh.

317
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,336
Hey, you.

318
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,506
Yes.

319
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,049
You seen a dog?

320
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,718
Dog?

321
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,388
I can't sleep because of that fucking dog.

322
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,769
Every time I'm trying to get some sleep,

323
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:16,314
that son of a bitch
just keeps barking over and over!

324
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,984
I can't live like this. You know?

325
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,237
Can you hear that barking? Huh?

326
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,115
<i>There are people
who are a bit strange.</i>

327
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,536
You have to look closely to know.

328
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,704
I should've never come out here.

329
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,373
I came out here to look for it

330
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:36,334
and then that stupid dog
actually started chasing me.

331
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:39,212
Barking at me over and over again.

332
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,548
Kid, have you seen a dog out here or not?

333
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,967
No, I haven't seen it.

334
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,427
Hey. Hear that?

335
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,390
Where the hell
is this fucking barking coming from?

336
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,435
There! Can't you hear it?

337
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,438
No, I don't...

338
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,732
<i>You have to look at them
very closely.</i>

339
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,988
Hey. You don't hear that? Huh?

340
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,740
But I... You...

341
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,744
hear that?

342
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,956
Yeah, you! You fucker!

343
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,333
<i>Then you pretend
you didn't see anything strange.</i>

344
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,960
<i>Just act like you saw nothing.</i>

345
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,044
Sir?

346
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:24,007
Sir, my mom's waiting. And I'm late.

347
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:28,094
Oh, yeah, yeah. Go on. Go on. Go on.
Go home.

348
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,815
Vitals are back to normal.

349
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,776
Well done.

350
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,445
He's not out of the woods yet.

351
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,364
Honestly, it's a miracle
he's still hanging on.

352
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,449
True.

353
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:52,285
He's been on the verge of death
so many times already.

354
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:56,205
I have no idea what kind of forces
are keeping him alive.

355
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,001
Your guess is as good as mine.

356
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,880
This patient remains unconscious.

357
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,966
Where does his will come from?

358
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,721
It could be that it's not just his will
that we're seeing right now.

359
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,354
Someone...
anyone can you hear me?

360
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,940
Help me out.

361
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:06,234
You see me, don't you? Right over here.

362
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:09,445
I've been here so long!
So, please. I wanna leave!

363
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:13,241
Help me! Won't you, help me?

Mom!

00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,847
Mom.

398
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,350
Mom.

399
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:31,230
Mom, Mom, Mom!
Something really weird happened!

400
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,817
Why is it so dark in here?

401
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,989
Are you mad at me for being late?

402
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,783
Oh, what, the lightbulb again?

403
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,369
Oh, Mom, I didn't forget it on purpose.

404
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,705
I went all the way down to the light shop,

405
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:50,499
even though it was pouring rain
the entire time.

406
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:54,420
There were so many weirdos
running around out there though,

407
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:57,048
and the light shop owner
told me that I should just go.

408
00:36:57,131 --> 00:37:00,384
So, I'm sorry, I really couldn't buy it.

409
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,304
Mom, are you okay?

410
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:07,683
Mom, please, don't be mad at me.

411
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,810
I'll get the lightbulb tomorrow.

412
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,854
Hm? Come on...

413
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,982
Okay.

414
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:19,070
Mom, don't be angry.

415
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,866
You're so quiet.

416
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:31,165
You smell really nice, Mom, you know that?

417
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,753
Like flowers.

418
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,291
Do you think they were together?

419
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,835
Could it be...

420
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,296
that those two know each other?
