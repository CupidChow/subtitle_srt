Hey there. Um, so...

16
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,770
Ah, good evening, um...

17
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:35,650
I was wondering,
what are you doing by yourself out here?

18
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,905
Just waiting.

19
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,283
That bus was the last one for the day.

20
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:46,744
Yeah.

21
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,417
Well, it looks like you're trying
to get somewhere.

22
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,503
Though I'll warn you at this hour,

23
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:58,131
there usually aren't
a lot of taxis in this area,

24
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,426
so you really ought to call
a service for one instead of just waiting.

25
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,220
Not possible.

26
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,139
I lost my phone.

27
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,558
Oh, really? Sorry to hear that.

28
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,018
Here, you can use mine.

29
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,477
I just need... Ah, shoot!

30
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,646
Why is the screen cracked?

31
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,274
Oh. Sorry about that.

32
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,318
I'm pretty sure it still works though.

33
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,987
I can try calling your phone
if you'd like.

34
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,113
What's your number?

35
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,491
I'm not like that.

36
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:30,288
I just, you know, need your number
so I can call it to find your phone.

37
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,502
Okay, well, how about this?

38
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,296
You call it yourself and...

39
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:42,258
You know who I am, don't you?

40
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,179
Have we met already?

41
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,317
Sorry about that.

42
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,820
Didn't mean to sound forward.
I'll just leave you be.

43
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,334

44
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:19,087

46
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,675
Oh, man, it's raining!

47
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,929
What the...

48
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,472
Hey!

49
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,310
What the heck are you doing here
sitting all alone in the rain, huh?

50
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,356
Don't you know me?

51
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,150
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

52
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,779
We met right here yesterday
and we talked and everything.

53
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,328
This is crazy.

54
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,205
Here, take my umbrella.

55
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,707
I live right there,
so I can just run for it.

56
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,876
You need this more than I do.

57
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,586
You know me, right?

58
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,505
Yeah, I do.

59
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,882
'Cause you saw me yesterday...

60
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,510
and the day before that?

61
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,181
What about tomorrow?

62
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,350
What?

63
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,771
Well, it's nearly midnight
and the day's ending soon.

64
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,607
Yeah, yeah, you're right, that's true.

65
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,530
I don't have much time.

66
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,283
Sorry, but what are you talking about?

67
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,576
I don't understand.

68
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,079
I'm feeling quite cold.

69
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,624
You mentioned your house is close?

70
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,879
Um... you mean,

71
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,090
do you want to go there with me?

72
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,550
Yes.

73
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,969
Together.

74
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,395
Oh! Oh, wait!

75
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,304
I can take your bag for you,
if you'd like.

76
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,014
No, no.

77
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,349
It's fine.

78
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,267
It's just that...

79
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,623
You sure
you don't want me to call a taxi?

80
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,794
Would you open the door for me, please?

81
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,507
Leave it off.

82
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,394
You can come in.

83
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,086
EUGENE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
NEWLY UPGRADED

84
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,594
These are the new results.

85
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,262
Is there bleeding
at the incision?

86
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,972
The amount of bleeding is minimal.

RESTRICTED AREA
NO UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY

90
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,008
Go, go, go. Ask her now.

91
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,596
Ms. Heo, your eyes again?

92
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,306
That's right.

93
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,350
I've got floaters.

94
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,601
Have you seen a doctor?

95
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,146
We're in a hospital.
Of course, I've seen a doctor.

96
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,272
And their opinion?

97
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,691
{\an8}They don't know what's causing it.

98
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,359
{\an8}Visual symptoms - threadlike black dots,
floating cobwebs, shadows, or black clouds

99
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,903
{\an8}- They gave me eye drops and that's it.

100
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,906
{\an8}Just like with tinnitus,
they don't know the cause.

101
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,575
{\an8}Since joining the ICU, you know,

102
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,285
{\an8}I hear all these weird noises.

103
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,411
Yeah, me, too.

104
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,871
That's why I'm always cleaning my ears.

105
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,998
And all the triple shifts, it's too much.

106
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,708
She's right, Ms. Heo.

107
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:34,211
Seriously, what are we going to do?

108
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,504
This isn't new.

109
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,256
I've dealt with this for 15 years.

110
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,924
Fifteen years?

111
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,801
Ah, that's awful.

112
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,887
We've got to change things around here.

113
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,597
- Or at least eat better.
- Exactly.

114
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,723
Hey.

115
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,142
- How's <i>ramyun</i> sound?
- Great idea.

116
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,602
It'll smell,

117
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,313
so make sure you go
into the locker room to eat it.

118
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,899
Oh, come on, eat with us.

119
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,442
Who will watch the monitors then?

120
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,068
Their vitals are stable.

121
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,361
And the ER is quiet.

122
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,990
Did you just say it out loud and jinx us?

123
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,534
Oh.

124
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,952
You should go eat with them.

125
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:09,872
I can cover you.

126
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,749
That's not enough food for you.

127
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,460
Night shifts are tough,
and you only have cherry tomatoes.

128
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,003
What? I like them.

129
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,965
I'm in charge of the ICU anyway,
so I have to be here.

130
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,176
I'll watch the monitors.

131
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,973
You haven't even had dinner yet, Ms. Heo.

132
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,058
Oh, no.

133
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,268
This is a big deal, Ms. Heo,
you could pass out.

134
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,437
- You need to eat something.
- Come on, come on, come on.

135
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,691
{\an8}- Get us if anything goes wrong.
Yep.

136
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:38,943
We'll be quick, okay?

137
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,762
Sir, you can't be in here.

138
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:08,764
Excuse me?

139
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,183
Can I help you, sir?

140
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,311
Only authorized personnel
are allowed in here.

141
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,231
You're not allowed
to visit the ICU at night.

142
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,400
You have to schedule ahead
during the week, too.

143
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,032
Oh. So, then...

144
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,743
Can you not hear me...

145
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:30,911
when I talk to you?

146
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:35,791
Where's the morgue?

147
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,130
It's bed one!

148
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,099
Move.

149
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,191
- Page the doctor.
- Okay.

150
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,444
Switch now.

151
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,793
What happened?

152
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,128
Why'd the tube fall out?

153
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:24,924
I'm sorry.

154
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,969
Could it be it wasn't tightened properly
when it was changed?

155
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,680
We see that now and then.

156
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:35,893
Stay focused.

157
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:36,977
Yes.

158
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,813
Ms. Park, I need a word with you.

159
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,700
Oh...

160
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,416
EPISODE 1: STRANGERS

161
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,254
Oh, fuck, it's cold.

162
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,933
You son of a bitch!

163
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,655
Hey!

164
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,991
Shut the hell up!

165
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,745
Put a fucking muzzle on that dog!

166
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:02,187
I swear. If I see it,
the dog's gonna get it.

167
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,227
What brings you here?

168
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,855
Shouldn't that be obvious?

169
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,024
I came to buy lights. You got any?

170
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:48,859
Yeah.

171
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:52,112
I'd like two bulbs, LED. Daylight.

172
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,489
Twenty watts, if you have it.

173
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,286
Wow. Boy, there sure are lots
of incandescent lights.

174
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,331
People don't use these anymore, right?

175
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,210
Are vintage lights your thing?

176
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,670
Yes.

177
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,423
You could say that.

178
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,305
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

179
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,517
This is for you.

180
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,437
Take care.

181
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:25,956
What brings you here?

182
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,640
Are you looking for something?

183
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:22,721
ILKWANG GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

184
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:48,705
Hello.

185
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,666
What brings you here?

186
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,169
I need to get a fluorescent light.

187
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,214
Right. Which one would you like?

188
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,092
One about this size.

189
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,635
Bright white, if you have it.

190
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,512
Just a moment.

191
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,401
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

192
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,656
I never noticed this light shop
when I walked by during the day.

193
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,575
But it really stands out
when it gets dark.

194
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,744
You're always open late?

195
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:28,870
Yes.

196
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,123
You could say that.

197
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,536
Take your seats. Please take your seats.

198
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,497
- Oh-ho.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

199
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,878
EVENING SELF STUDY

200
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:20,213
So, I'll be in charge
of tonight's study class.

201
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,381
No one's missing, right?

202
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,800
Hey, what kind of self-study is this?

203
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,093
It's forced study.

204
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,553
We don't want to do it.

205
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,096
Settle down. Quiet.

206
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,098
Lemme call the roll.

207
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,516
Ipsae?

208
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,601
- Here.
- Here.

209
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,644
- Nuri?
- Here.

210
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,730
Speak up, please. Haneul?

211
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,148
- Here.
- Here.

212
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,649
- Gippeum?
- Here.

213
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,276
Here. Eutteum?

214
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,778
- Here.
- Here.

215
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,905
- Gaeul?
- Here.

216
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,114
- Chukbok?
- Here.

217
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,783
- Bobae?
- Here.

218
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,117
- Mirae?
- Here.

219
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,535
- Dodam?
- Here.

220
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,662
- Haetsal? Here.
- Here.

221
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,061
What is this place?

222
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,396
What brings you here?

223
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,234
Wow, it's so bright in here.

224
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,652
Are you looking for something?

225
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,530
It's just... just...

226
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,949
that it's so cold at my place.

227
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:32,702
I tried to turn up the blanket,
but I can still see my breath.

228
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,454
How does one live like that?

229
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,790
You've walked into a light shop.

230
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,625
Oh, you're right.

231
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,169
Wow, look at that bulb.

232
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,755
So unique.

233
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,216
Please don't touch that.

234
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,304
That's no way to run a business.

235
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,472
I wouldn't break it.

236
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,516
Oh, hey.

237
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,017
Listen. Can't you hear that dog?

238
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,769
Why are you looking
for a dog around here?

239
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,521
Have you seen a dog or not?

240
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,189
No, I have not.

241
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,109
I swear I heard that dog
somewhere around here.

242
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:07,446
I'm gonna find you,
you son of a bitch.

243
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,443
Wow, it's coming down a bunch.

244
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,153
Kinda scary.

245
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,197
Oh, sure, scary.

246
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,823
You've got some drool on your mouth.

247
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,368
Hey.

248
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,079
You guys...

249
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,666
- Have you heard the story?
- About what?

250
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,418
Oh, come on, now.

251
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,337
You're obsessed with scary stories.

252
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,922
There's a student...

253
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,218
No one at school has a clue who she is.

254
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,094
Oh.

255
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,804
Students are like, "Who is she?"

256
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:15,889
Nobody...

257
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,474
No one knows at all.

258
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:19,976
- Who is it?
- Who's that?

259
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,311
Don't know.

260
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,146
And some say they've seen her.

261
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,481
Really?

262
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,441
Another ghost story?

263
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,652
Okay, just think about it.

264
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,820
Every class has a few empty seats, right?

265
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,370
I think...

266
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:41,540
- that's her seat.
- Hey, stop that.

267
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,416
That makes no sense.

268
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,584
What a load of crap.

269
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,462
If we can't see her sitting there,

270
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,965
how is anyone supposed to know
she's even there?

271
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,009
There are tons of pictures, look there.

272
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,345
The school albums, selfies.

273
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,264
And so, when you look at those...

274
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,100
there are people
you don't recognize at all.

275
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:03,228
You're like, "Was this kid
I've never seen actually in my class?"

276
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,566
- That's how I know.
- Hey.

277
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,359
Stop it.

278
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,528
Wait. Do you believe this stuff?

279
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,364
Whatever. I'm hungry.

280
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:15,824
Should we go to the store after class?

281
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,242
I have to run an errand.

282
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,120
What brings you here?

283
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,092
Please don't touch anything.

284
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,426
Next time, you pay.

285
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,470
Oh, that's not very generous.

286
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,514
Hey, hey, I'm getting wet.

287
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:05,517
- Well, it's a small umbrella.
- Come on.

288
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,352
- It's raining so much.
- Come closer.

289
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:10,188
- Let go! Let go!
- Hey, are you crazy?

290
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,025
Oh.

291
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,027
Why did you stop here?

292
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,321
You guys...

293
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,323
You know the story of this alley?

294
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,158
Uh...

295
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:25,704
Is it a story about how dark it is?

296
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,790
I have to go through there
to run an errand for my mom.

297
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:32,961
I heard, someone keeps wandering
around here at night,

298
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,921
and you can even hear strange singing.

299
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,423
Hey, stop it!

300
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,842
There's no singing! Let's just go, okay?

301
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,552
Right. There's no one there.

302
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,178
Your stupid stories.

303
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,305
It's freaking dark, though.

304
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,515
Guys, it's fine.

305
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,309
It's really bright
when you get to the other end.

306
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,438
Yeah, but I saw it.
Just last week, I saw it.

307
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,522
What's that?

308
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:53,648
That white thing! Right there!

309
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,359
Don't hit me.

310
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,236
I want to go home now!

311
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,697
Hey, quit grabbing my arm! Let go!

312
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,532
See ya.

313
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,134
Oh, hi. Hello, sir.

314
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,761
Hi, Hyunju.

315
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,222
Running in the dark,
you could hurt yourself.

316
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,015
Here for your mom again?

317
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,100
Yes.

318
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,310
Mom needs me to buy another bulb.

319
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,479
- Have a seat and relax.
- Thanks.

320
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,525
Which one do you want?

321
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,986
The yellow one, butter flavor.

322
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,696
You always pick the yellow one.

323
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:08,074
- Yeah, my mom only ate those as a kid too.
- Hmm.

324
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,744
Here you go.

325
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,416
Mmm. Hey.

326
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,878
Do I look like a kid
who can't unwrap her own candy to you?

327
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,590
You're still a kid in my eyes.

328
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:26,050
My mom also says I'm still like a child.

329
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,931
You are still a child.
Only children wear one of those.

330
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,057
JOO HYUNJU

331
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,310
Oh. This thing?

332
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:38,688
It's my identification necklace
my dad got for me when I was little.

333
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:39,898
He lengthened the chain though.

334
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,358
Well, I bet your dad loves you very much.

335
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,986
Yeah. He's really protective.

336
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,947
He works abroad,
so I don't get to see him that much.

337
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,199
It's not like I'll get lost or anything.

338
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:53,161
I wear it because, you know,
it was a gift my dad gave me.

339
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,997
He must be a proud dad.

340
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:57,874
I know that feeling, too.

341
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:00,627
Hmm...

342
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,004
How old are you,
if you don't mind me asking?

343
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,797
I would say I'm old enough.

344
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,133
Why do you wear sunglasses indoors?

345
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,761
It's very bright.

346
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,057
My eyes are bad from working here.

347
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,976
Yeah, maybe,
you should do something about that.

348
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,896
Lower the lights?
It's way too bright in here.

349
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,814
I can't do that.

350
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,859
I mean, after all this is a light shop.

351
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,244
Don't you think you drink too much coffee?

352
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,788
It's because we're open late.

353
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,790
How late are you open?

354
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:41,793
Until the sun rises.

355
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,754
Do you ever get any customers that late?

356
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:45,922
Of course.

357
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,216
Even for one person, I must wait.

358
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,843
Oh, that must be tough.

359
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,305
But I'm actually really glad
that you're open late.

360
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,598
Why is that?

361
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,642
Because it's so bright in here, you know.

362
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,352
And also cause you're here, sir.

363
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:05,316
Seriously. You're the only reason
I can walk down that alley.

364
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,902
It's like really, really dark
out there, you know.

365
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,738
And scary.

366
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,407
No, it's not.

367
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,367
You see? You're still a child.

368
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,077
That isn't it.

369
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:21,457
They say that there's a ghost near here.

370
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,710
There are stories
like that everywhere.

371
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,462
Yeah, but I saw it.

372
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:32,760
You saw it?

373
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,014
Well, I didn't...

374
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,974
really see it very clearly, but...

375
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,770
But what?

376
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:43,896
Did you see it?

377
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,109
It was dark,
so I couldn't see very well, but...

378
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,614
What's wrong?

379
00:33:58,619 --> 00:33:59,787
You live with your mom?

380
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,998
Yeah, it's just the two of us.

381
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,503
Why are you asking?

382
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,339
Oh, it's nothing.

383
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,308
Hyunju?

384
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,893
Huh?

385
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,438
The truth is...

386
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,983
I think you saw something
that other people can't see.

387
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,569
What?

388
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,280
Some people have a special gift.

389
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,116
You... could be one of them.

390
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,578
What do they see?

391
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,123
They see strangers.

392
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,709
What do you mean "strangers"?

393
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,297
I see them as well.

394
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,677
I've been here a very long time.

395
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,263
And I look after the shop on my own.

396
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,891
The customers are the only people I see.

397
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:06,104
And so, I trained myself...

398
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,689
to carefully observe them.

399
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,817
LIGHT SHOP - LIGHT

400
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,401
Many types of people...

401
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,904
come here at night.

402
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,492
<i>Most are just ordinary people.</i>

403
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,955
I need to get a fluorescent light.

404
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:28,376
Are there people who aren't ordinary?

405
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,003
There are people who are a bit strange.

406
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,422
They...

407
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,134
can blend in with the rest of us.

408
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,719
They blend in?

409
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,932
How are they strange?

410
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,229
You have to look closely to know.

411
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,031
I can't always tell

412
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,617
so I look carefully.

413
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,327
What is this place?

414
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,331
Wow, it is so bright in here.

415
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,625
There is always something different there.

416
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,794
It's just hard to notice.

417
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,220
Closely.

418
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,600
You have to look at them very closely.

419
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,188
Telling them apart is...

420
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:32,857
difficult.

421
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,027
So you have to be careful.

422
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:39,739
What should I do if I meet one?

423
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,200
Pretend they're not there.

424
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,243
Huh?

425
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,537
And should you meet one of them...

426
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:48,873
do not look their way.

427
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,460
What if I already did?

428
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,964
Then you pretend
you didn't see anything strange.

429
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,591
Just act like...

430
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,427
you saw nothing.

431
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,947
It's getting late.

432
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,031
You should go.

433
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,534
Yeah.

434
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:30,748
I shouldn't have frightened you
with such a scary story.

435
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,751
Oh, that's okay. It was fun.

436
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,337
It's dark. Will you be all right?

437
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,546
Of course, I will.

438
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,426
See?

439
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,637
Just a sec.

440
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,016
A present.

441
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:53,646
Turn this and the light will come on.

442
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,106
You see?

443
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:57,275
- Oh, cool.
- It's on.

444
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,237
Oh, thank you very much, sir.

445
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,614
- You'll use it in the dark?
- Yep.

446
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,366
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

447
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,076
It's getting late. Hurry back to your mom.

448
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,160
Yep.

449
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,691
I'll go ahead and get you a towel.

450
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,731
Good evening.

451
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,203
Hey, Mom. I'm home.

452
