1
00:00:57,098 --> 00:01:03,980
Light Shop

2
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,489
You can change that lightbulb out,
you know.

3
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,951
There's nothing bad you can say
about the bones of this place.

4
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,746
You got an elegant living space,
easy to keep tidy.

5
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,290
Not to mention,
the rooms are pretty big too.

6
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,626
Look at this water pressure.

7
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,131
So, what's going on with the windows?

8
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,718
That's 'cause you have a road
right out there.

9
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,428
On the first floor, too.

10
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,264
We're trying to make sure
young ladies like you are safe.

11
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,523
How strong is the lock on the door?

12
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,817
Door lock?

13
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,777
Signing a contract gets you a key.

14
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,320
I'd suggest changing the lock.

15
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,906
That's usually what new tenants do.

16
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,759
Is it not to your liking?

17
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,720
Maybe you should take the last one.

18
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,098
That one was well within your budget.

19
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:24,060
I mean, that apartment was pretty nice,
even if it was a little old.

20
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,105
I hate apartments
'cause there are neighbors everywhere.

21
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,441
Why?

22
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,652
So, is this area quiet?

23
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,280
You can put a dining table,
right here!

24
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,447
What did you say?

25
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,159
You're in the back of an alley,

26
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,537
and all the other houses are empty,
so yeah, it's really quiet.

27
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,167
A table?

28
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,965
No one's ever around here.

29
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,967
It's always gonna be nice and quiet.

30
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,178
You won't find a cheaper house than this.

31
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,680
So you should hurry up
and take this one off the market.

32
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,765
Come on, tell me what you're thinking.

33
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,564
That door doesn't open.

34
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,276
The room isn't finished,
so you can't use it yet.

35
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,154
And what am I supposed to do
until then?

36
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,865
Well, that would be why
the deposit is so cheap.

37
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,909
Besides, there are two other rooms
in the house.

38
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,994
Just use one of them.

39
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,079
It doesn't matter how cheap it is,
it's wrong.

40
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,707
Then you can apply
for the apartment instead.

41
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,043
Those two are your only options
on the market right now.

42
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,503
I hate apartments,
I told you that.

43
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,547
Ma'am, look.

44
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,633
You were the one
who said you liked this place.

45
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,051
What did you call me?

46
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,136
When did I tell you that?

47
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,640
Sorry, sorry, sorry. My mistake.

48
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,350
I confused you for someone else.

49
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,811
All right. Are you signing or what?

50
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,980
There's gotta be something else out there.

51
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,149
Well, it's nothing you can afford.

52
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,112
Shit.

53
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:11,079
Episode 2: The Door

54
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,697
So much for quiet? Tsk.

55
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,524
It's even more scary
because of the rain.

56
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,583
Seriously?

57
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,306
Is it because the house is so old?

58
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,872
I don't see any improvement.

59
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,211
Doesn't look like
there's anything else to do.

60
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,715
Keep an eye on this a little longer.

61
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,925
Then we can re-evaluate
if we continue life support.

62
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,009
Yes.

63
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,226
Who is it?

64
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,855
Who are you?

65
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:14,567
Go. Go away.

66
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,694
He's an alcoholic.

67
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,864
ICU placed him here
when they ran out of beds.

68
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,323
His delirium's severe.

69
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,035
His behavior is affecting
the stability of others in the ward.

70
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:28,122
Let's move him to another room
when he recovers, yeah?

71
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,707
Okay.

72
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,792
It's not easy around here.

73
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,711
Too many patients, not enough staff.

74
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,131
And no one wants to work in the ICU.

75
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,924
I'll try and get more nurses
assigned here.

76
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,093
- Reinforce all of your staffing needs.
- Okay.

77
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,596
I better go.

78
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,765
- Anything else you need me to address?
- Right.

79
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,142
We have the guardians
waiting outside right now.

80
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,685
What would you like us to say?

81
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,313
- I can speak with them.
- Okay.

82
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,538
Whatever we could do,
I assure you we have done.

83
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,081
Now, we wait.

84
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,126
Pulling through
depends on the will of the patient.

85
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,212
I don't understand.

86
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,339
Could you please help me understand?

87
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,840
I'm sorry, ma'am.

88
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,301
At the end of the day,

89
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,845
it comes down to how strong
the patient's will to live is.

90
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,807
If the hospital can't do anything,
what good are you?

91
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,391
What good are you

92
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,852
if you aren't going to do anything
to help?

93
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,482
Honey.

94
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,037
Dear.

95
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,135
What's that?

96
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,961
Shit. Not again.
Are you serious?

97
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,890
Fucking hell.

98
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,462
If the hospital can't do anything,

99
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,047
what good are you?

100
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,423
What good are you

101
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,510
if you aren't going to do
anything to help?

102
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,583
Yeah?

103
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,253
There's something I wanted to ask.

104
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,672
What?

105
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,883
You were all saying
it would depend

106
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,386
on the patient's will to live.

107
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,390
Are you...

108
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,726
one of the family members then?

109
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,399
I'm so sorry.

110
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,528
We're doing everything we can
to make sure they pull through.

111
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,240
So, this will to live...

112
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,825
Yes.

113
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,619
How exactly does that happen?

114
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:28,834
If a person is unconscious,
how do they find that willpower?

115
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:33,130
Actually...

116
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,633
I was always curious about that.

117
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:42,848
I was in an accident once,
and I was found unconscious at the scene.

118
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,435
And the doctor said that
to my mother, too.

119
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,396
Or something close to what you heard.

120
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,442
"The patient's will is what's key now."

121
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:59,031
She was upset, my mother,
since she didn't understand either.

122
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,326
Believed that there were no alternatives.

123
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:05,495
I woke up
not too long after that.

124
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,250
Though, um...

125
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,546
I still don't know what it was
that ended up bringing me out of it.

126
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:19,259
All my mother said was that
she prayed every day.

127
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,971
She wanted to give me the will
to push through it.

128
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,516
See, that's why...

129
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,810
It could be that...

130
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,606
I was not the only reason
why I was able to survive.

131
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,111
I'm sorry.

132
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,659
I know I'm a nurse,
but I still have no idea.

133
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,871
How can someone have a will
when they're unconscious?

134
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,290
Where would they find any?

135
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,209
I couldn't even say.

136
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,836
There's no way to know.

137
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,381
So, we just have to wait.

138
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,134
So, we wait and do
everything in our power, you know?

139
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,188
- What are you doing?
- So what are you going to do then?

140
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,357
Are you telling me
there's nothing you can do?

141
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:19,319
Listen to me,
you have to save her somehow!

142
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,530
Do everything in your power to save her!

143
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,698
Do you understand?

144
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,783
You have to save her somehow!

145
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,578
I don't care what you do, just save her!

146
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,290
Save her!

147
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,667
Save her! Save her!

148
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,005
Are you okay?

149
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,144
Is everything okay in there?

150
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,115
Are you all right?

151
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,993
Yeah, sure.

152
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,704
I... I think I'm okay.

153
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,431
Hey, you're the guy?

154
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,726
You're the one singing
in the alley every night?

155
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,645
Why are you singing like that
while going back and forth?

156
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,815
Hey! Hey!

157
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,027
What the hell?

158
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:43,171
All right, everyone, we all know
that midterms are coming up, right?

159
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,090
- Yes.
- You been studying hard?

160
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,093
Yes.

161
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,011
The rain's really coming down
out there right now.

162
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,055
Let's say our farewells. Go on.

163
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:56,143
Now, ready? Everyone bow to the teacher.

164
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,602
Thank you.

165
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,486
Hey.

166
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,947
Should I wake her?

167
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,323
-No, leave her alone.
-What?

168
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,741
Come on, hurry up, let's go.

169
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,077
But if we leave her,
she might sleep until morning!

170
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,829
-That'll be good for her, right?
-No.

171
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,582
-Come on, let's get out of here.
-You're really just gonna leave her there?

172
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:21,585
Hurry up! It's raining.
I don't wanna get stuck in it!

173
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,631
Hey, Eutteum.

174
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,342
Eutteum.

175
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,469
What?

176
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,138
The class is done.

177
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:37,058
Ten minutes.

178
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,895
I said it's done.

179
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,064
You're so pretty.

180
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:45,817
Just let me sleep.

181
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,102
What could that be?

182
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,816
Hey.

183
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,360
Do you wanna share?

184
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:55,905
Who are you?

185
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:59,909
Well, just a student in the area.

186
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,246
Where are you going?

187
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,582
To the light shop.

188
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,917
Why are you going there?

189
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,796
My mom asked me to run an errand.

190
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,798
Are you lost?

191
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,137
Where do you live?

192
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,015
The Somang Apartments.

193
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,339
And should you meet
one of them, do not look their way.

194
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,349
What if I already did?

195
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,518
Then you pretend
you didn't see anything strange.

196
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,105
My mom...

197
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:56,359
I-- I just remembered
wants me to hurry back now.

198
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:31,811
Mom! Mom!

199
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:36,149
It's you! Mister! Help me, over there!

200
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,612
Your mother.

201
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:43,948
Go.

202
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:33,873
Seriously?

203
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,417
They didn't wait?

204
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,273
I saw it.

205
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,359
Did you see it, too?

206
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,610
Sorry if I scared you.

207
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:49,282
It's just... not many people
tend to use this alley at night.

208
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,201
Where are you going?

209
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,871
There's a light shop
at the far end of this street.

210
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:58,583
It's really bright,
so if I could just get there...

211
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,586
I'd be able to get home then.

212
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,131
Are you heading to the light shop, too?

213
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,717
Did you wanna tag along with me
if you are?

214
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,019
- Are you alone?
- What?

215
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,314
I asked if you were here alone.

216
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,358
Right now?

217
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,362
Yeah. Alone.

218
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:50,301
Why does the light keep going out?

219
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,690
Shit.

220
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,568
What's wrong?

221
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,783
Well, it's always been dark in this alley.

222
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,453
But then these windows lit up
just like now.

223
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:46,375
I tried taking a peek because I thought
maybe somebody had moved in,

224
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,213
and then the lights went out
and the window opened.

225
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,052
Hey. You're the guy?

226
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,721
You're the one singing
in the alley every night?

227
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:03,101
But I saw...
someone else behind her.

228
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,687
Do you think they were together?

229
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:11,484
Yeah,
they were together. Why?

230
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,734
The lights keep going out
in the house.

231
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,537
Because that thing
was meant to hide in the darkness.

232
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:10,084
Somehow... it had been living
in this house with me.

233
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,171
Could it be...

234
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,299
that those two know each other?

235
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,596
No. Let's go! Come on.

236
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,062
Are you hurt?

237
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,568
You and I are a lot alike, aren't we?

238
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,124
What's wrong with my legs?

239
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,668
What's wrong with my legs?

240
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,046
What's happening to me?

241
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,222
Do you really think
you can leave this place?

242
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:09,101
I have to go home.
I wanna go home.

243
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:14,065
I need to get out of here!

244
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,361
I have to get out of this place!

245
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:02,488
Please! Is anyone there?

246
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:10,246
Help me, please! Please help me!

247
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:22,133
Please! Is anyone there? Help me!

248
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:25,136
Somebody, help!

249
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:30,224
Anyone? Hello? Anyone...

250
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,615
I know you're there!

251
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:51,954
Come on...
Just get me out of here.

252
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:55,916
The door is locked, I can't get out!
Come on! Come on!

253
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,437
Someone, please,
just help me get out of here.

254
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,399
I wanna go back home right now.

255
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:26,322
You're outside, I can hear you.
I'm begging you!

256
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:29,533
- Please, just open the door.
- Somebody, anybody, please, listen.

257
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,661
- I can't get out.
- You gotta get me out of here.

258
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,331
I can hear you.
Just open the door please!

259
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:39,126
Please open the door.

260
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,420
I'm begging you, please!

261
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,924
I know you're there, I can hear you.

262
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,885
I need your help.

263
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,805
Please... I can't do it.

264
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:55,643
You just have to open the door.
Please, help me...

265
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,089
What brings you here?

266
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:01,667
Anything you're looking for?

267
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,592
Perhaps, you'll know what it is.

268
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,888
Just tell me what you need.
Maybe I can find it for you.

269
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:24,482
Can I ask you some questions?

270
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,193
What brings you here?

271
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,444
I'm with the police.

272
