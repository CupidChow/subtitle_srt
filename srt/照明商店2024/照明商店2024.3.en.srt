179
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,702
[Sungsik] Is this a case, or an accident?

180
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,245
It looks like an accident.

181
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,955
[Sungsik chuckles] Your mole's gone.

182
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,457
Oh, yes.

183
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,167
You can't smoke around here.

184
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,467
-You removed your mole?
-Yeah.

185
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,345
Wow, that's crazy.

186
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,933
We met in passing when I was called in
for the arson case, you know.

187
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,392
How did he even remember that?

188
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,853
He's famous for his keen eye.

189
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,231
He remembers a face from just a look.

190
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,024
Captures every little detail.

191
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,110
Wow, you know
he has to have the best record.

192
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,447
Well, uh, no, not really.

193
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,617
<i>I mean, if anything catches his eye,</i>
<i>then the case isn't truly closed.</i>

194
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,703
He'll keep at it until everything
is completely settled.

<i>but his performance rate is low.</i>

[coroner] Sir.

205
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,609
Examination record?

206
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,153
We'll get it soon.

207
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,948
And the presumed cause of death?

208
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:29,326
Sudden death.
Likely an acute myocardial infarction.

209
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,704
-Family?
-[Giyeol] None present.

210
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,998
His wife passed away years ago.

211
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,667
And his children went overseas,
so he was alone.

212
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,010
So this acute myocardial infection...

213
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,428
[coroner] Infarction.

214
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,762
Okay, sure. That one.

215
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,055
An infarction would mean

216
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,475
signs of [grunts] squeezing
his heart in agony, is that right?

217
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,312
Then why is his expression like that?

218
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,897
Peaceful.

219
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,565
[coroner] Maybe it wasn't acute.

220
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,484
You're right, [groans] who knows why?

221
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,655
In some cases, people become lively
before they really die, you know.

222
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,158
[grunts] Yeah... Terminal lucidness.

223
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,327
Uh... "Terminal lucidity."

224
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,953
Well done. You want a medal?

225
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,832
[coroner] I think it was
an acute myocardial infarction.

226
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,336
The deceased was taking
cardiovascular medication regularly.

227
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,005
Don't all old people have heart issues?

228
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,924
[coroner] Uh... true.

229
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,926
Why? What's going on?

230
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,553
This expression is familiar.

231
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,721

Well done. You want a medal?

238
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,617
He called his children and grandchildren,
one after another.

239
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,412
So, you're suspecting suicide?

240
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,248
Not possible with an acute infarction,
don't you agree?

241
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,543
[coroner] And committing suicide
is usually something you plan in advance.

242
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,628
Yeah.

243
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,838
[coroner] An acute infarction
means it's sudden.

244
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,591
-You can't really prepare that.
-Yeah.

245
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,760

00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,438
Oh, no.

543
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,816
Ah, Mom told me to buy a bulb though.

[stuttering] Okay.

552
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,550
You have a lot of customers late at night.

Well, I was also drawn here in a way.

554
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,351
This place is strange.

555
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,395
