00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:04,022
Light Shop

2
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,986
{\an8}5 YEARS AGO

3
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,868
Sleep well?

4
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,079
Is it morning now?

5
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,289
Mmm, it's morning.

6
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,336
This is the hospital, huh?

7
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,172
So I was always here then?

8
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,384
Actually, for a month,
you were over in the ICU.

9
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,265
It feels like
it's been way longer than that.

10
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,269
Just think of it this way.

11
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,189
Dreams can feel eternal,

12
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,191
even if you only sleep a little while.

13
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,152
I see.

14
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:55,198
It's different,
the time in that place.

15
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,574
What place?

16
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:03,289
You know, I can't tell
what time it is, or where we are.

17
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,708
Delirium, that's why.

18
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,711
Don't worry too much.

19
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,465
Those in the ICU
often face this after surgery.

20
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,343
Keep up with treatment
after you're discharged.

21
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,054
Only then will it get easier.

22
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,477
But the light was really pretty.

23
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,776
Merry Christmas.

24
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,784
Ms. Heo? I plan to transfer schools.

25
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,579
So I can dream a different dream.

26
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,043
Thank you for this.

27
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,045
You take it.

28
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,548
A Christmas present.

29
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,260
Thanks.

30
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,263
Jesus rose too, you know,
after three days.

31
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,639
An event like this warrants a gift.

32
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:02,849
COME BACK TO US
COME ON, YOUNGJI

33
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,809
Hmm, it seems you like it.

34
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:08,104
One day, I wanna be like you.

35
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,694
It's bed one!

36
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,488
Oh, shoot.

37
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,910
Why does the ventilator keep falling out?

38
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,828
Hey, page the doctor now!

39
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,014
This is a good sign.

40
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,517
Oh.

41
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:33,856
I must be seeing things.

42
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:47,370
DO NOT CROSS, POLICE LINE
UNDER INVESTIGATION

43
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,821
Where... am I?

44
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,165
Huh, it still won't open.

45
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,542
What do we do?

46
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,877
Let's wait one more day.

47
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,545
Okay.

48
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:48,806
NAME: LEE JIYOUNG
NOTE: FUNERAL SCHEDULED

49
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,405
Episode 8: Light

50
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,517
Seriously?

51
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,895
NOT IN SERVICE

52
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,866
Sorry about that.

53
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,160
Ugh. Sir, please be careful.

54
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,840
Kim Hyunmin

55
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,844
You still don't know me?

56
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,390
You really don't know?

57
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,850
Huh?

58
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,602
How long are you going to stay like this?

59
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,564
How long
are you going to stay like this?

60
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,569
Why don't you know me?

61
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,321
- Why don't you recognize me?
- Wait... What's wrong?

62
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:31,409
- Huh? Huh?
- Did you even love me? Huh?

63
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,289
Did you even love me at all?

64
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,916
Uh? Huh?

65
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,295
What the hell? What should I do?

66
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:45,339
These people
can't see us right now.

67
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,050
You're the only one
who can see me.

68
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,844
What do you mean they can't... Hello?

69
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,722
Hello?

70
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,140
Excuse me, can't you hear me?

71
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:57,185
How long will it take for you
to remember me?

72
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,440
- Now there's no more time!
- What do you...

73
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:05,109
What!

74
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:10,531
What is... No...

75
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:15,161
Wake up. Please wake up now.

76
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,164
You have to wake up
right now!

77
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:35,306
I'm sorry.
Why didn't I recognize you?

78
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,267
Why didn't I recognize you?

79
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,524
CHECK-IN
CHECK-OUT

80
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,111
It's still not budging.

81
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,699
Wow.

82
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,743
We can't afford to wait.

83
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,371
Let's go ahead and rip it open.

84
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,206
Okay.

85
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,920
Stop crying.

86
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,631
What are we...

87
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,677
What are we gonna do now?

88
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,070
What should I do now?

89
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,550
I have a favor to ask you.

90
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,225
Favor?

91
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,480
Oh, well, tell me what you want me
to do for you.

92
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,402
Will you... do anything I say?

93
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,071
Oh, I swear I'll do anything.

94
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,290
Go to the light shop then.

95
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,876
What?

96
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:28,669
Tell them...

97
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,422
that you need something there.

98
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:37,345
You need a light that glows
when you start getting closer to it.

99
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,350
You have to use your will to find it.

100
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,729
When I start getting...

101
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,149
What does that even...

102
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,318
I don't get it.

103
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:57,531
Find your light, no matter what.

104
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,273
I'm so sorry.

105
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,277
Did you also die, sir?

106
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,575
I'm dead, too.

107
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,328
I'm so sorry.

108
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,206
It was all my fault.

109
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,544
I'm sorry.

110
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,921
I noticed...

111
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,215
The brakes weren't working
like they should.

112
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,011
But people were already waiting.

113
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,392
I made excuses.

114
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,729
Wanted the company to handle it.

115
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,109
I didn't want to pay if I didn't have to.

116
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,237
I'm sorry.

117
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,573
I know it's all my fault.

118
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,579
If I had known that this would happen...

119
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,581
It is your fault.

120
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,960
This is all because of you.

121
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,758
Yet, it's a relief...

122
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,302
to hear that you're truly sorry.

123
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,345
I am sorry.

124
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,807
I'm really sorry.

125
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,061
An accident...

126
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,607
isn't something one can avoid.

127
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,319
We're unfortunate.

128
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,280
You're unfortunate, too.

129
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,075
But don't blame yourself for all of this.

130
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,954
Misfortune is what was meant to be.

131
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,126
Where will you go now?

132
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,795
I'm not sure, but...

133
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,215
I need to keep looking.

134
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,510
There's no time left.

135
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,638
I'm going to find those who are alive

136
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,599
and take them to the light shop.

137
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,602
So you're trying
to send them back.

138
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,229
I am, too.

139
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,775
They'll all forget their pain.

140
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,906
And that's why you shouldn't give up.

141
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,288
Go to the Somang Apartments.

142
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,042
Where do you live?

143
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,794
The Somang Apartments.

144
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,440
I'm sorry.

145
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:04,111
I'm so sorry.

146
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,533
It's all my fault.

147
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,082
I've been looking for you everywhere.

148
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:21,962
I'll bring you to the light shop now.

149
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,197
I'm so sorry.

150
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,373
I'm so sorry.

151
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,789
Mom?

152
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,003
Mom?

153
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,671
What brings you here?

154
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,550
You can't come back here.

155
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,763
Did you not hear me just now?

156
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,436
You're already dead, huh?

157
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,232
JOO HYUNJU

158
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,609
You live with your mom?

159
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,611
Yeah, it's just the two of us.

160
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,160
Hyunju is still alive.

161
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,333
One has to come here on their own.

162
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,757
You can't bring her here?

163
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,348
That won't work.

164
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:13,188
Wait... right here.

165
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,399
Yuhui. Yuhui.

166
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,069
Yuhui. Yuhui.

167
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,030
Yuhui.

168
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,948
- Papa...
- Papa's here.

169
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,659
Sorry I took so long.

170
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,847
You okay?

171
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,890
What the...

172
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,373
Don't go.

173
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,959
I came to find you.

174
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,045
What?

175
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,424
On the way here, I met your mother.

176
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,759
You mean you know her?

177
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:52,013
Your mom can't speak right now.

178
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,728
I'm here to tell you...

179
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,857
what it is that she can't say.

180
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,359
Will you listen to me?

181
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,072
Oh, what's wrong? Are you okay, sir?

182
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,122
Don't you know what's going on?

183
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,583
No.

184
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,295
You and I have met once already.

185
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,007
Do you remember?

186
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,927
Uh, well I...

187
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,889
You probably have no idea
what happened

188
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,808
and no idea where we are right now.

189
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,811
Uh, what do you mean by that?

190
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:43,398
Oh, sir!

191
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:44,858
Sir, are you okay?

192
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,569
Uh... Excuse me? Uh...

193
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,115
She can't see us.

194
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,117
Huh?

195
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,120
I know it's confusing.

196
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,541
You just think about it.

197
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,837
The moment you're aware of it,
you'll know.

198
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,424
What do you...

199
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,345
SELF-STUDY

200
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,429
Did I call everyone?

201
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,097
Okay then. Get to studying.

202
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,682
Uhm...

203
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,437
Whatever. I'm hungry.

204
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,939
Should we go to the store after class?

205
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,649
I have to run an errand.

206
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,108
Cool.

207
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,076
Hey, are you gonna pay?

208
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,453
Aw, seriously? I'm still in here.

209
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,080
Good evening.

210
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:45,752
Uh...

211
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:48,046
Uh, sir?

212
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,466
What's going on?

213
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,302
I'm so sorry.

214
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,347
For what?

215
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,140
I'm sorry.

216
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,853
I really wanted to apologize.

217
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,856
Uh, no, wait, wait a minute.

218
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,443
- What are you...
- I guess I can't.

219
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:14,322
I can't take you
to the light shop myself, can I?

220
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,576
The light shop?

221
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,330
Your mother wanted
to tell you something, but couldn't.

222
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,750
Your mother is...

223
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,169
frantic, really.

224
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,757
Trying to send you back, even now.

225
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:19,471
Uh-uh, no.

226
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:22,057
I don't wanna... Mom.

227
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,017
No. Mom!

228
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,811
No! Mom!

229
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,942
Can't... can't I just stay with you?

230
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:36,613
I wanna stay with you, Mom, please.

231
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,909
Mom, please.

232
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,786
I don't wanna go.

233
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,998
I just wanna stay with you.

234
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,961
No...

235
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,381
Mom, no...

236
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,925
I wanna stay with you!

237
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:12,732
No. No.

238
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:26,579
Ah, no! I don't...

239
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,707
Mom, you're here!

240
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,584
I said I don't wanna!

241
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:35,839
Please, let me stay here with you, Mom.

242
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,590
Please, let me stay.

243
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,678
Mom, I don't wanna leave you.

244
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,101
Mom...

245
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,898
Mom...

246
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,362
Your dad...

247
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,742
is waiting.

248
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:05,910
No!

249
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,203
No!

250
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,924
Mom!

251
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,218
Please, Mom!

252
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,847
I don't wanna go!

253
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,060
I wanna stay with you.

254
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,562
Please!

255
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,523
Can't I just stay with you?

256
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:41,029
No!

257
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,856
- Don't cry.
- Hmm.

258
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,247
Hyewon.

259
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,915
Mmm-hmm.

260
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:55,538
LIGHT SHOP

261
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,036
What brings you here?

262
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,518
You looking for something?

263
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:02,855
So this is it.

264
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:18,746
This is a good sign.

265
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,665
Page the doctor now.

266
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,500
The patient regained consciousness.

267
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,388
Hyewon.

268
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,724
I'm back.

269
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,717
I was right.

270
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,845
I hope we don't ever meet again.

271
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,268
If I drop it, then what?

272
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,023
Do I get to live here?

273
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,443
Take it.

274
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,155
It will make it easier for one to move on.

275
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,170
I want the world
where we can live together.

276
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,608
- You okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

277
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,861
Thinking about how she woke up

278
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,696
and then just died right after.

279
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,407
{\an8}Terminal lucidity?

280
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,742
{\an8}Terminal lucidity -
Waking up just before dying.

281
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:20,827
{\an8}Meaning the light returns.

282
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,829
{\an8}She must have seen the light.

283
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:23,996
Let's go.

284
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,737
Do what I told you.

285
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,367
All right.

286
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,293
Now, go.

287
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,557
I'll follow you.

288
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,239
Find your light.

289
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,867
No matter what, find it.

290
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,144
What brings you here?

291
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,523
I came
because I needed something.

292
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,696
<i>You have to use your will</i>
<i>to find it.</i>

293
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:09,328
<i>You need a light that glows</i>
<i>when you start getting closer to it.</i>

294
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,205
Please do not touch that.

295
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,169
Will you please not touch anything.

296
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,633
Looks like it's not your will.

297
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,479
Hyunmin!

298
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,059
EUGENE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

299
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:58,145
{\an8}THREE MONTHS LATER

300
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,773
See you all later.

301
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,194
Good work.

302
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:07,113
- Ms. Heo. Thank you for today.
- Wait.

303
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,240
How come you always volunteer
to do the night shift?

304
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:10,324
Mmm...

305
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,201
'Cause it was always night over there.

306
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,911
Huh?

307
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,371
See you.

308
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:19,291
- I'm heading out.
- Mmm-hmm.

309
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,043
- Get home safe.
- Mmm-hmm.

310
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,469
Getting discharged today, right?

311
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,012
Oh, hey.

312
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,181
You'll have to return
to get treatment for your leg.

313
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,599
Your delirium, how is it?

314
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,601
It's better by a lot.

315
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,104
Hmm. And it should continue to improve.

316
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:42,815
It's still quite hazy though.

317
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,275
Like, where are we?

318
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:46,986
What time is it?

319
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,698
Are you sleeping well?

320
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,160
Sometimes...

321
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,037
I have this dream I'm wandering.

322
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,249
It's okay though.

323
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,794
When I wake up,
my body is drenched in sweat.

324
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,380
Yet it's comforting, weirdly enough.

325
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,176
Wait...

326
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,511
Hold on.

327
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:14,763
A present.

328
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,265
- For me?
- Mmm-hmm.

329
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:17,683
You're getting discharged.

330
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,018
Gotta celebrate.

331
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:20,311
Oh.

332
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,483
These are for kids, you know?

333
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,734
Hey.

334
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:27,985
Just watch.

335
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,238
Ta-da.

336
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,574
You won't get lost in the dark now.

337
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,910
I'm off.

338
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,330
I'll see you around.

339
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:40,789
Hey! What do you mean?

340
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,374
You gonna get hurt again?

341
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,001
Forget it. This is farewell.

342
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,879
I hope we don't meet again.

343
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,006
Okay.

344
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,008
Wait a second.

345
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,092
Hmm?

346
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:55,346
I feel like
I've heard that before.

347
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,097
Heard what?

348
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,017
"I hope we don't meet again"?

349
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:07,441
Yeah, that guy is blunt on the outside,
kind on the inside.

350
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,609
Huh?

351
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,030
Bye.

352
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,199
Bye.

353
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,223
The light is nice.

354
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,822
- Good morning.
- Oh.

355
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,749
You have to find the light!

356
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,669
Save her!

357
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,254
<i>You have to find the light!</i>

358
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,965
You have to find the light.

359
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,342
You have to find the light.

360
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,946
Hey! You got a dog?

361
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,198
Just ended up with one.

362
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,327
Guess there's been another accident.

363
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,996
Got quite a few residents.

364
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,012
Who knows...

365
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,139
if they'll be residents...

366
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,643
or if they'll only stay a little while?

367
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,081
<i>Please exit to the rear of the bus.</i>

368
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,625
<i>Please exit to the rear of the bus.</i>

369
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,213
Departing now.

370
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,138
Hyunju.

371
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,141
Hyunju. Hyunju.

372
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:32,020
We're here. You have to wake up.

373
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,397
Huh?

374
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,190
We home now?

375
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,067
Um, no.

376
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,193
You're at school.

377
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,156
Oh. Right. School.

378
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,325
You okay?

379
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,578
Hm.

380
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,125
You're really okay?

381
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,294
You sure
you're up to going to school today?

382
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:57,463
Hmm.

383
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,715
It's not like I have delirium anymore.

384
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:02,384
Um... Whose daughter is this?

385
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,220
You know I'm your daughter.

386
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:08,932
I should go back to school,
even though I couldn't take the C-SAT.

387
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,642
I wanna see my friends, too.

388
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,478
All right. Done.

389
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,229
But I'll be right here
to pick you up, okay?

390
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:15,981
It's okay.

391
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,858
'Cause it's only a few stops, so...

392
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,109
The bus is fine.

393
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,194
No, no, no.

394
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:23,280
I'll be here, waiting for you
over at the school gate.

395
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,657
Hm.

396
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,120
Hyunju.

397
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,706
Good luck.

398
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:33,874
Come on.

399
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,044
You're my daughter. Right?

400
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,339
Hm.

401
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:44,134
JOO HYUNJU

402
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,427
I got this.

403
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,948
Now...

404
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,991
The C-SATs are over.

405
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,702
So the group projects are our focus, okay?

406
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,372
Hyunju was away,

407
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,500
so she's the only one
who hasn't been able to join a group

408
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,961
Which group should she join, huh?

409
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,760
Actually, um...

410
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:29,680
Can I... skip the group project instead?

411
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:32,140
Huh? What for?

412
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:33,767
It's just...

413
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,894
'Cause I haven't been here.

414
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,187
Oh, no, no.

415
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,064
Don't say that. It's okay.

416
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:42,442
Come on, girls, she can join in,
isn't that right?

417
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,819
You can work with us.

418
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:44,903
We'll take you!

419
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,864
Yeah, you can join our group.

420
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,615
You can join our group.

421
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:49,741
Over here.

422
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,578
Uh...

423
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:55,289
can I go to the nurse's office to rest?

424
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,583
Oh why? Uh...

425
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,209
Something wrong? You unwell?

426
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:00,794
Yes.

427
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:03,505
Oh, all right then. You can go.

428
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:04,590
Feel better.

429
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,928
Rest up.

430
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:12,598
Hey, when you're done,
come join my group, okay?

431
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,395
All right, everyone,
let's get to work.

432
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:21,189
Split into your groups
and prepare for your presentations.

433
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:22,941
Yes.

434
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:39,708
NURSE'S OFFICE

435
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,733
It's freezing cold.

436
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,405
That place was real.

437
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,670
Mom, I remember.

438
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:30,676
I didn't get treated for delirium
'cause I wanted to remember you.

439
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,769
It's a relief that place exists, Mom.

440
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:49,820
LIGHT SHOP

441
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:24,104
- Dad, I'm here.
- Oh.

442
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,564
It's so cold.

443
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:29,067
It's snowing so much outside. Hey.

444
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:32,696
Ugh, it's freezing.

445
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:34,656
My ears are going to fall off.

446
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,743
Dad, what time are you done working?

447
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,244
Well, when the sun rises.

448
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:40,746
I work until it's light out.

449
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:43,582
Ah, that must be hard.

450
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,460
- You should finish early.
- Ah, it's okay.

451
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:47,753
- Hm?
- Take a seat.

452
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,759
- You want some candy?
- Do I look like a kid?

453
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:56,094
Hey... To me, you do.

454
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:02,601
Here. I'll do it.

455
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,895
Max, what do you think?

456
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:10,150
I always love it when it snows.

457
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,569
It's not special.

458
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:14,029
The snow never changes.

459
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:33,924
LIGHT SHOP

00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:25,350
FINAL EPISODE

461
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:33,859
Huh?

462
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:38,029
Aren't you cold?

463
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,616
You'll get sick.

464
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,413
Thank you.

465
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,123
For talking to me like this.

466
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,168
No big deal.

467
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,253
Are you in my class?

468
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,797
You don't remember meeting me?

469
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,090
Did you forget?

470
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:02,512
But you waved at me from the window.

471
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,057
Did I?

472
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,767
You even talked to me once.

473
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:08,935
Oh, sorry.

474
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,478
I thought I was alone.

475
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:20,780
<i>I've never had</i>
<i>any friends before.</i>

476
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,490
<i>Then you saw me and said hi to me.</i>

477
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,160
But after you left,

478
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,787
I was all alone again.

479
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:31,708
So I followed you here.

480
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:33,627
PARK SEONU

481
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,337
I could really use a friend.

482
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,091
I'm keeping a secret too.

483
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:21,633
Get out here.

484
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,719
I heard that there's a ghost in the area.

485
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:26,596
That you?

486
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,434
Do I sound too impolite?

487
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,436
Mr. Kim.

488
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,688
Come out, please.

489
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:38,858
You're here.

490
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:39,985
I knew it.

491
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,529
You knew I would be here?

492
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,906
When I said "see you again,"

493
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:48,410
you said "that's right,"
didn't you?

494
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,123
Let's just...

495
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:54,791
talk naturally.

496
00:54:57,502 --> 00:54:58,753
Get me coffee then.

497
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:04,426
Let me see.

498
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,095
I only have instant coffee.

499
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,057
So do you only drink...

500
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,143
instant coffee, sir?

501
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,062
Why so polite?

502
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,567
It's just that we're face to face now.

503
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,444
Being this casual feels awkward.

504
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:24,446
I don't even know your age.

505
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,699
That didn't bother you before.

506
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:29,868
Not knowing you at all...

507
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:33,038
was... easier.

508
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,667
Come to think of it.

509
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:39,169
I don't even...

510
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:40,712
I don't know your name, huh?

511
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,590
Yang Sungsik.

512
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,968
Hmm.

513
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:01,316
A toast? Really?

514
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,777
Because it's our first.

515
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,821
You're not actually supposed
to toast at a funeral.

516
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,240
Shouldn't the dead person
make that decision?

517
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:11,618
I couldn't even go to your funeral.

518
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,870
'Cause I was in a coma.

519
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:17,749
You asshole!

520
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,126
What's with your eyes?

521
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:27,342
I wanted to check something.

522
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,304
I heard about it after I was discharged.

523
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:32,972
That you saved me.

524
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:37,519
Well, it was an emergency, that's why.

525
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:39,854
Thank you.

526
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:41,689
And I'm sorry.

527
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:42,982
Really?

528
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,653
The light shop...

529
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:49,114
You were luring me there.

530
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,408
I know that now.

531
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:54,244
You finally found it, but...

532
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:55,703
walked out and wandered away.

533
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:59,040
Thank you again.

534
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,208
You saved me.

535
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:03,294
No. I just did my job, that's all.

536
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,507
And what is your job, by the way?

537
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:13,096
Well, it's my job to send people
who shouldn't be here to the other world.

538
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:15,390
Either here to there, or there to here.

539
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,892
Like the woman who died in that fire.

540
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:19,978
Is that why you were chasing her?

541
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,067
She already died.

542
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,569
She had no idea.

543
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:29,320
I got in the way of your work.

544
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,948
No. You were doing your job, that's all.

545
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,994
And the old man in Seongnae-dong?

546
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:38,246
I was just being nosy.

547
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,791
And because of that,
I ended up being traced by the police.

548
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,085
The liver spots I saw were...

549
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:45,712
jajang sauce.

550
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:48,423
There's no way for ghosts
to eat jjajangmyeon though.

551
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:52,802
For a long time, he had lived all alone.

552
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,014
And he was starving
'cause he couldn't leave his house.

553
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:58,224
His legs were too weak.

554
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:00,477
So I went there ahead of time

555
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,688
to treat him to a bowl of jjajangmyeon
as his last meal before he died.

556
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:05,773
<i>Boiling it</i>
<i>made it very tender,</i>

557
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:08,067
<i>which is exactly what we want because</i>...

00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,924
He didn't die alone at least.

560
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,425
He was fortunate.

561
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:34,552
What happened?

562
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,638
Once he got to that place.

563
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:38,598
Somehow...

564
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:39,933
Life always starts again.

565
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:43,603
So complicated.

566
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:50,235
Anyway...

567
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,863
What exactly are you even doing here?

568
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,199
Just passing through.

569
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:58,826
- And I won't return.
- Why not?

570
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,954
Gotta leave.

571
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:03,581
Everyone can eventually move on.

572
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:06,292
By the way...

573
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,171
you have... unique eyes, don't you?

574
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,256
A keen eye as well.

575
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,092
You can see what other people can't.

576
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:17,095
Like you saw the woman,
the night of the accident.

577
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:19,055
Not everyone can see ghosts, you know.

578
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,266
Is that so?

579
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:23,268
Right now?

580
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,395
You're seeing me too.

581
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:27,730
That's right.

582
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:30,024
What should I do?

583
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:34,028
I was in an accident,
so it seems there's a vacancy here.

584
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:35,822
So then what?

585
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,241
I can't do my work.

586
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,493
I have to go over there.

587
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:48,835
Take these.

588
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,378
They're yours now.

589
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:57,218
Now you'll really have a lot to solve.

590
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,848
Many unsolved cases.

591
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,860
I'll continue with my work then.

592
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:28,875
SANGIL-MYEONGA
BUSINESS SUSPENDED

593
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,935
Ugh, I'm so sore.

594
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:33,439
I wonder what kinds of good things
will happen at work today?

595
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,033
Hmm?

596
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,330
Excuse me.

597
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,458
That's mine.

598
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,877
Oh. Here.

599
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:01,592
Ah...

600
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:05,096
You're the nurse. That's right.

601
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,558
Do we know each other?

602
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:12,228
How long have I been looking for you?

603
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:15,857
Who are you, sir?

604
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:19,569
- Why did you do that to me?
- What?

605
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:22,572
I was in so much pain, you know?

606
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:26,242
Why did you turn your back on me?

607
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:28,911
What are you talking about, sir?

608
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:33,291
- Could you help me, please?
- Oh.

609
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:34,792
It's my chest...

610
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,127
Can you wait over there?

611
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,672
<i>Only you could see me.</i>

612
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,716
Why did you do that?

613
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:45,094
Why are you angry?

614
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:46,637
Don't know?

615
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:51,726
Why don't you know? Fuck!

616
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:25,676
Oh, Nurse Kwon. Long time no see.

617
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,846
Yang Sungsik?

618
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:33,518
I already have my hands full.

619
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:35,603
Cooperate and make this easy.

620
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:45,154
Sleep disorders, hallucinations,

621
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:48,199
and clouding of consciousness
are all symptoms of delirium.

622
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:52,578
About 20 percent of ICU patients
experience delirium.

623
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:55,498
It's better during the day
and is worse at night.

624
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:58,543
You are currently taking
medication for it.

625
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:00,878
But this environ--

626
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:03,589
Are you listening?

627
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,633
Kim Hyunmin?

628
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:08,135
Ah, yes.

629
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:11,138
Did you hear what I said?

630
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:13,182
Yes.

631
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:16,686
You know, Doctor...

632
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:22,358
I've already heard all of that before,
many times, over and over.

633
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:25,778
So I'm begging you,
please help me, I'm going crazy.

634
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,864
But it's like...

635
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:31,325
The sun is out and yet,
to me, it feels like night.

636
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:33,244
It's all in my mind, you see.

637
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:37,248
And then when all of you explain it,
every doctor says the same thing.

638
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:40,042
Please listen to me.

639
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:42,253
I've been told I have a girlfriend,

640
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:43,963
but she's dead.

641
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:46,090
And I, uh...

642
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:49,260
I don't remember anything.
I just can't remember.

643
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,388
Oh, I don't know.

644
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:54,473
Damn it!

645
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:00,438
So what now? I'm fucking screwed.

646
01:05:01,105 --> 01:05:02,440
I'm crippled now too.

647
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:05,651
Why do you always say
the same things to me, Doctor?

648
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:08,154
You're making great progress though, sir.

649
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:10,656
Doctor, I don't even feel sane.

650
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,826
I told you...

651
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,995
That's just a common symptom of delirium.

652
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:17,914
Damn it, stop!

653
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:20,124
Stop saying that and help me!

654
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:34,388
Let's try this then.

655
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:37,266
Remove certain environmental factors.

656
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:40,436
Doing that will reduce
your confusion and anxiety.

657
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:42,146
Clean up your surroundings.

658
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:45,608
Only keep objects you need,
and get rid of unhealthy relationships.

659
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:48,861
This ensures what you perceive around you
is as clear as possible.

660
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,280
That goes for your emotions, too.

661
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:53,282
Reduce unnecessary stimulation.

662
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:55,201
Be sure to keep only what you need.

663
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:58,162
As for the rest,
you should throw it all away.

664
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:00,665
Be sure to keep only what I need.

665
01:06:01,832 --> 01:06:02,917
Okay.

666
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,044
Take my advice
into consideration.

667
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:06,587
I'll see you next session.

668
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:46,228
I'LL GO WHERE YOU ARE

669
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,189
HYUNMIN DIDN'T DIE
HYUNMIN IS ALIVE

670
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:49,273
HE'S STILL ALIVE

671
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:45,579
ARE WE HAVING A GET-TOGETHER
TO CELEBRATE HIS RETURN TOMORROW?

672
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:47,540
WE'VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH!
WE SHOULD HAVE DINNER

673
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:51,335
EVERYONE MUST COME
TO CELEBRATE HYUNMIN'S RETURN

674
01:08:51,418 --> 01:08:52,419
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME

675
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:53,504
THANK YOU

676
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,060
{\an8}3 MONTHS AGO

677
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:11,105
<i>Is this... the end for me?</i>

678
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:14,066
You are going to a better place.

679
01:09:14,775 --> 01:09:16,152
It's a world...

680
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:18,445
where everybody can eventually move on.

681
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:21,031
<i>I've already been there.</i>

682
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,580
<i>But why...</i>

683
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:31,667
<i>Why couldn't he remember me?</i>

684
01:09:34,211 --> 01:09:35,754
<i>In that place...</i>

685
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:39,008
<i>other people were able</i>
<i>to remember each other.</i>

686
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:42,178
<i>Why was it different for us?</i>

687
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:46,348
<i>I tried so hard,</i>
<i>but I still couldn't get him to remember.</i>

688
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:49,935
<i>Could it be...</i>

689
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:53,147
<i>he didn't actually love me?</i>

690
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:56,025
What you're feeling...

691
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:58,277
is lingering attachment.

692
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,322
But you should move on.

693
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:05,826
<i>I'm disappointed.</i>

694
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,328
<i>I'm sad.</i>

695
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,788
<i>And upset.</i>

696
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,709
<i>I miss him.</i>

697
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:28,766
<i>I really hope...</i>

698
01:10:28,849 --> 01:10:31,685
<i>that he remembers me</i>
<i>and calls my name again.</i>

699
01:11:40,004 --> 01:11:41,880
<i>I really hope...</i>

700
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,633
<i>that he remembers me</i>
<i>and calls my name again.</i>

701
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:54,018
I'll follow you.

702
01:13:00,584 --> 01:13:02,836
SOLVED

703
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:06,673
{\an8}MISSING PARK SEONU CASE
INVESTIGATION RECORD

704
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:29,154
What's this?

705
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:30,447
Oh, well.

706
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:33,117
You know how Jungwon High School
collapsed a few days ago?

707
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,160
I was told to report
the accident in writing.

708
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:37,538
Why a written report? Gotta investigate.

709
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:39,623
The higher-ups stopped it.

710
01:13:39,706 --> 01:13:41,458
Huh? Who?

711
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:44,211
And what is this kid doing here anyway?

712
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,755
Well, she's here to testify.

713
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:49,299
She barged in to the scene
of the accident that night.

714
01:13:49,883 --> 01:13:51,468
Are you hurt, young lady?

715
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:54,263
No.

716
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:56,557
I don't get hurt.

717
01:14:08,193 --> 01:14:09,945
Which apartment is it this time?

718
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:30,424
Young man, stop.

719
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,054
What?

720
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:37,598
You live here?

721
01:14:37,681 --> 01:14:39,516
- No, I don't.
- Then leave.

722
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:41,768
Why're you talking to me like that? Shit.

723
01:14:41,852 --> 01:14:42,895
Don't go in there.

724
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:45,439
Ah-ha, and why not? Tell me.

725
01:14:45,522 --> 01:14:47,065
Well, because it's dangerous, of course.

726
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:48,650
What?

727
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:50,235
What's so dangerous?

728
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,029
Huh? What?

729
01:14:52,112 --> 01:14:53,530
What's in this building?

730
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:54,781
Is it a ghost?

731
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:00,579
Who are you?

732
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:03,332
Hold up, why do you care?

733
01:15:03,415 --> 01:15:04,583
Who the hell are you?

734
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:05,792
Gangdong Police.

735
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:07,669
Detective. Yang Sungsik.

736
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:08,754
Gangdong resident.

737
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:10,422
Unemployed. Kim Youngtak.

738
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:12,716
What'd you say about ghosts?

739
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,343
You see something?

740
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:17,179
Do you see something, Detective?

741
01:15:17,262 --> 01:15:19,014
Just answer my question.

742
01:15:19,097 --> 01:15:20,766
Are you interrogating me or what?

743
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:24,603
Dead people.

744
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:28,440
They have nothing to do
with how time passes.

745
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:29,525
What?

746
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:32,110
I see them, yeah.

747
01:15:34,571 --> 01:15:35,697
Like this.

748
