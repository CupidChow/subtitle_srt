your volleyball skills

731
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,667
When it comes to
a game of volleyball,

732
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,700
all begins with a serve.

733
00:43:11,833 --> 00:43:14,667
Serving is putting the ball
at play

734
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,500
and the service
dictates the game.

735
00:43:17,633 --> 00:43:19,933

immediately.

In volleyball,

747
00:43:51,467 --> 00:43:53,300
defense is as crucial
as an offense.

748
00:43:53,433 --> 00:43:57,400
No spike is too powerful
for a receiver or for a libero.

749

No matter how strong the serve
or how much it hurts to receive,

750
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,733
we shouldn't let the ball
hit the ground.
