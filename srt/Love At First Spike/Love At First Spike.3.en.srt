Coach, Uno shouldn't
be in this team.

914

- Because he has a temper.

- Only to you.

No, but as one of

I think I know
what's best for us.

920

You put Uno on the team

921

just because you think
he has potential.

922
00:46:53,467 --> 00:46:55,433
But that doesn't guarantee us
a shot at the V-League.

a good chance of winning
