00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,940
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,049
(Anyang County, Xingrong County)
The lotus falls into the mire.

4
00:00:56,059 --> 00:00:59,049
(Linchuan County, Guichi County, Lin'An)
A bitter life, like a fleeting dream.

5
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:03,219
Misplaced trust in the seemingly just.

6
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,258
Children's garments stained
with blood and tears.

7
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:09,579
Childhood hopes extinguished.

8
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,849
Wronged souls demand justice
in the court of Yama.

9
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,939
(Song Ci)

10
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,810
What are you doing here, sir?

11
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:03,090
I don't remember a thing.

12
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:04,930
Are you sick?

13
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:06,530
Your family thought you died,

14
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:07,930
so they buried you.

15
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,419
The pulse is steady and strong.

16
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,899
I doubt he is sick.

17
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,800
(Actor, Wang Ling)
You must've been set up!

18
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,810
They went for your life.

19
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,050
(Actor, Zhao Zhiting)
Luxurious garments and smooth hands.

20
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,139
He is well-off.

21
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,650
A likely target for raiders.

22
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,259
But...

23
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,289
But all his belongings are here.

24
00:02:22,499 --> 00:02:23,610
What exactly

25
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,058
did he go through?

26
00:02:25,059 --> 00:02:27,378
Can you stop acting
like a detective for once?

27
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:30,658
My mind is a blurry swirl.

28
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:32,889
I don't have any answers.

29
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:42,490
Oh no.

30
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:47,330
Seize them!

31
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:49,259
What?

32
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,139
They carry costumes!

33
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,019
What do you want?

34
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,098
What did we do?

35
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:54,000
- Their stuff is in the bag.
- What do you want?

36
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:00,250
You disguise as ghosts
in the cemetery! Seize them!

37
00:03:00,499 --> 00:03:01,689
Bring them in!

38
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,169
Actors dressing up as ghosts.

39
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:18,889
You are rotten beings in fancy clothes.

40
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,218
Did you kill Deng Guang?

41
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:22,530
Come clean!

42
00:03:24,499 --> 00:03:27,330
I want him dead or alive.

43
00:03:29,339 --> 00:03:30,810
What do you mean?

44
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,859
All we did was steal some offerings
for the dead.

45
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,250
- What are you hiding?
- We didn't hurt anyone.

46
00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:37,889
We even rescued this old man.

47
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,090
We came from humble backgrounds,

48
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:42,050
but we wouldn't kill just to rob.

49
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:43,459
You can't pin this on us!

50
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,859
Twisting words now?
That's another charge.

51
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,899
We are wronged! We didn't do anything!

52
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,330
Sir, look at this.

53
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,690
(Inspector of Criminal Justice)

54
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,139
Lock them up.
We'll discuss this after the review.

55
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,090
Yes.

56
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,070
(Silence and solemnity)

57
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,699
Sorry for the misunderstanding.

58
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,378
I am now aware of

59
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:13,370
who you really are.

60
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:18,610
Inquisitor Song sent you here
as a test.

61
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,769
Why did you arrest us?

62
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,850
Lately,

63
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:28,329
there have been several
weird occurrences in this county.

64
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:30,699
It was all related
to the funerary opera actors.

65
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,569
Hence, this is a misunderstanding.

66
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,889
All these events

67
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,858
are connected
to Deng Guang's disappearance.

68
00:04:37,859 --> 00:04:38,899
Cursed beggar!

69
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,499
Where did you get the money to drink?

70
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,098
And you bought yourself a coffin!

71
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:43,218
Alive,

72
00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:45,009
I live in a rundown house.

73
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:46,290
In death,

74
00:04:47,739 --> 00:04:49,899
I'm going to have a nice resting place.

75
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,250
What good is it if you're dead?

76
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,430
(Deng Guang)

77
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,410
Great!

78
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,649
Good work!

79
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,670
(Tomb of...)

80
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,379
Where did he go?

81
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,930
See if he went home.

82
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:06,298
Are you in there?

83
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,009
Aren't we hitting the gambling parlor?

84
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,970
Keep it in mind.

85
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:23,689
A funerary opera

86
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:29,250
is not meant for the living.

87
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,490
I'm tired of living!

88
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,379
I'm tired of living!

89
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,298
Time to face my death!

90
00:06:37,299 --> 00:06:39,619
Time to face my death!

91
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,259
I'm tired of living!

92
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,139
(Deng Guang)

93
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,250
(was haunted by an evil ghost.)

94
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:46,490
And then,

95
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,538
he went missing.

96
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:48,850
Since Inspector Song and you

97
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,089
have arrived in this humble county,

98
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,738
I know you can uncover the truth

99
00:06:52,739 --> 00:06:55,449
and free the people from this terror.

100
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:57,939
We don't know Inquisitor Song.

101
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,619
We are not detectives.

102
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,449
However, the badge is indeed ours.

103
00:07:06,739 --> 00:07:08,689
Sir, where are you going?

104
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:12,329
To solve the case.

105
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,850
We'll go to
Deng Guang's house for clues.

106
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,689
Why do you have the badge?

107
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,050
No idea.

108
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,689
How are you connected

109
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,089
to Inquisitor Song?

110
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,810
No idea.

111
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:28,019
Were you in the coffin

112
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,009
because of
Inquisitor Song's secret visit?

113
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,858
I told him I don't know.

114
00:07:31,859 --> 00:07:33,059
All right. Relax.

115
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,778
If you knew nothing at all,

116
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:35,579
why did you say

117
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,658
the badge was ours?

118
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:37,418
Well...

119
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:38,538
The badge was a way

120
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:41,410
to get us out of trouble. So I...

121
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,978
What are you? A hound?

122
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:45,730
Stop sniffing for answers.

123
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,218
This old man may be suspicious,

124
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:50,240
but he lost his memory
and can't find a way home.

125
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,529
Have some sympathy.

126
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,619
People used to say
your strange birthmark

127
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,889
could predict trouble.

128
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,459
They called you a bad omen.

129
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,459
They blame every kid's death
and swine fever

130
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,978
on your curse.

131
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:02,689
You felt mistreated as well.

132
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,858
Don't take it to heart.

133
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,139
He is Song Ci's biggest fan

134
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,538
in a 100-li radius.

135
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:10,009
He is obsessed with the man.

136
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,738
He loses his mind whenever he hears

137
00:08:11,739 --> 00:08:13,129
the name "Song CI".

138
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:17,329
Sorry.

139
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,298
Sir, I got carried away earlier.

140
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,120
It's all right.

141
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,999
(Inspector of Criminal Justice)
Since this badge

142
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:25,858
means so much to you,

143
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:27,410
you may have it.

144
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,538
Please

145
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:30,298
help me get home.

146
00:08:30,299 --> 00:08:31,449
Will you?

147
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,049
We all get what we want. Sure!

148
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,889
Bad news.

149
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,769
Help!

150
00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:55,809
