2
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,419
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,180
(Anyang County, Xingrong County,
Linchuan County)

4
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:51,940
There is no need to be afraid.

5
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,139
That woman

6
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,459
is not a ghost.

7
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:56,139
Her name is Yue Zhen.

8
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,459
She is Baron Sun Hua's wife.

9
00:00:58,619 --> 00:00:59,420
She refuses

10
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,660
to believe Sun Hua has committed murder.

11
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,899
She is persistent in finding the truth.

12
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,940
What is the mystery about?

13
00:01:06,139 --> 00:01:07,339
The whole story

14
00:01:07,699 --> 00:01:10,140
began with a dog.

15
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,080
(Sun Hua, Head of the Sun family)

16
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,059
Open the door!

17
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,300
Hurry up!

18
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:42,899
Open the door!

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,259
Search the residence!

20
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:49,819
Wait!

21
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:50,979
What do you want?

22
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,979
Let go of me!

23
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,380
- Let me go!
- Bring him here.

24
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,459
County Official Liu.

25
00:01:58,779 --> 00:02:00,539
He was trying to destroy the evidence,

26
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,179
but we came in time.

27
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,459
The civilian who informed us was right.

28
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,220
You've committed murder.

29
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,658
Murder?

30
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:09,620
My husband!

31
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,180
What's going on here?

32
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,600
They said I killed someone.

33
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,739
We have the evidence.

34
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,940
Plead guilty now

35
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,859
and suffer a light sentence.

36
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,500
(Sun Hua's wife, Yue Zhen)
He only fought back to stay alive

37
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,060
when the wild dog attacked him.

38
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:22,859
He got the blood stain

39
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,459
when he fought the dog.

40
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,539
- Yeah.
- Arrest him.

41
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,400
I didn't kill!

42
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:26,600
Move!

43
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,250
- My husband!
- I'm not a murderer! Stop!

44
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,100
I didn't kill anyone!

45
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,620
My husband!

46
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,460
Where is it?

47
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:36,340
It was here just now.

48
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:39,419
My husband...

49
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:41,780
Impossible!

50
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,100
It was here just now!

51
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,660
Let go of me!

52
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,250
My husband...

53
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:45,200
It was here just now!

54
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,220
Silence!

55
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,000
No wonder people said you were insane.

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,600
I didn't do it.

57
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,650
Arrest him.
Magistrate Wang will interrogate him.

58
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,750
- It was here.
- My husband.

59
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,300
It was here!

60
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,300
- My husband!
- Yue Zhen!

61
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:54,500
Move!

62
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,750
I didn't kill anyone, Yue Zhen!

63
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,899
- My husband!
- Yue Zhen!

64
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,459
Sun Hua confessed as soon as

65
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,699
they arrived at

66
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:01,220
the administrative office

67
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,200
My husband!

68
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,299
My husband!

69
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,699
Answer me.

70
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,739
Did you kill someone that night?

71
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,060
It was a dog.

72
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,299
Just a dog.

73
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,699
You are insolent

74
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,180
and too stubborn!

75
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,500
Another 20 strikes!

76
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,340
Did you kill someone?

77
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,859
It was a dog.

78
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,419
That was...

79
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:36,539
It was...

80
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,019
It was a dog.

81
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,259
Or maybe I killed a person.

82
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:43,098
My husband has a golden heart.

83
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:45,500
He will never hurt anyone!

84
00:03:46,779 --> 00:03:48,100
Confess, Sun Hua!

85
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:51,660
How did you kill her?

86
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,699
How?

87
00:03:53,779 --> 00:03:54,780
With a stick.

88
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,299
With a stick.

89
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,778
My husband didn't kill anyone.

90
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,460
He beat a dog with a stick.

91
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:01,259
Why did you kill her?

92
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:02,259
Why?

93
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:03,660
It was chasing me.

94
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,739
It was chasing me.
It wanted to hurt me.

95
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,780
So I killed it.

96
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,799
Where did you bury the body?

97
00:04:10,619 --> 00:04:11,498
Where is it?

98
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:12,459
Confess!

99
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,739
Where did I bury it?

100
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,899
- Where is it?
- Where was it?

101
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,538
Confess!

102
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:16,460
If you refuse,

103
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,020
another 20 strikes!

104
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,120
North of the city.

105
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:20,780
North of the city.

106
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,859
A night raid there.

107
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:28,220
A night raid there.

108
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,059
A night raid north of the city
at the forest.

109
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:37,460
If I find out you've been lying to me,

110
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,820
you will pay for it.

111
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,859
Guards.

112
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,579
Go there and search the bushes.

113
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,460
Yes.

114
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:49,619
Did they find the body?

115
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,820
Sir,

116
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,538
we found the murder weapon and body

117
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:01,299
at the wasteland near the forest.

118
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:02,299
Impossible!

119
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:04,379
Someone is setting him up!

120
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,460
Look at the bruises.

121
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,820
They are all fatal injuries!

122
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,419
How despicable! This is unforgivable.

123
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,660
The body is cold.

124
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,419
Only a slight color change.

125
00:05:18,179 --> 00:05:19,539
The victim has only been dead

126
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,179
for less than three days.

127
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,900
The timeline matches yours!

128
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,539
My husband has nothing
to do with her death.

129
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,059
You are corrupt and incompetent!

130
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,900
You're a disgrace to the people!

131
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,999
Guards!

132
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,978
Remove this heckling vile woman

133
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:34,499
from here!

134
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,100
- You're a disgrace to the people!
- Yes!

135
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,379
You are corrupt and incompetent!

136
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:37,819
Stand up!

137
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,340
Curse you!

138
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:40,379
My husband!

139
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,700
My husband!

140
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:42,259
Move!

141
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,139
My husband!

142
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,340
Why did Sun Hua kill the woman?

143
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,100
No idea.

144
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,658
From what I heard,

145
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:50,179
the murdered woman

146
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:51,460
was wanted

147
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,859
for another murder.

148
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,460
She had it coming.

149
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,899
Did you see a dog's corpse?

150
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,140
No.

151
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:03,459
Sir, did you see a dog's corpse?

152
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,419
Go away, crazy woman.

153
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,700
Did you see a dog's corpse?

154
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,139
Did your husband really kill someone?

155
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,299
He must have been wronged.

156
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:16,738
He has always been kind.

157
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:18,260
He would never kill anyone.

158
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,739
A strong herbal scent.

159
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,460
Are you ill?

160
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,739
I've been unwell for a long time.

161
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,580
But as long as I still live,

162
00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:28,299
I will save my husband
and clear his name.

163
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:34,098
Why do you believe the wife?

164
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:35,739
Why don't you suspect her?

165
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:38,859
A chronically ill person
won't bother lying.

166
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,100
Besides,

167
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:41,939
the anguish and sadness

168
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,340
in her voice

169
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,700
were genuine.

170
00:06:51,179 --> 00:06:52,580
What is this method?

171
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,979
Over there.

172
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:56,580
I heard about this

173
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,419
from a novel about Song Ci.

174
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,140
According to Inquisitor Song,

175
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,820
when blood flows into the ground,

176
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:03,820
spreading rich rice vinegar

177
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,020
and wine

178
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:06,939
will show the original blood stain.

179
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,539
Am I right?

180
00:07:09,859 --> 00:07:11,059
Indeed.

181
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:13,580
Song Ci did say that.

182
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,220
Nice novel.

183
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,100
It seems Yue Zhen was telling the truth.

184
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:27,059
When Sun Hua brought the officers here,

185
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:28,220
there wasn't a dog's corpse.

186
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:29,780
Not even any blood stain.

187
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,819
It's apparent

188
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,460
that someone cleaned the place.

189
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:34,780
The usual.

190
00:07:34,859 --> 00:07:35,780
Song,

191
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,499
does your badge work
in this part of the world?

192
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:45,298
I heard about tales

193
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,499
of Inquisitor Song's feats
in Xingrong and Anyang.

194
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,538
Missing persons.

195
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,059
But the cases I got here

196
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:51,538
are closed cases.

197
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:52,700
Closed cases?

198
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:58,220
This is the file on Sun Hua.

199
00:07:58,299 --> 00:08:00,100
This is the file on the victim.

200
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:02,140
The victim was Pan Erniang.

201
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,619
She was recently wanted for killing

202
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:05,900
her secret lover.

203
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:07,299
She was on the run.

204
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,979
So many are missing.

205
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:11,460
Don't you find anything odd?

206
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:14,100
This county is poor.

207
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,939
It's expected that some might
want to leave.

208
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,179
Miss He.

209
00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:23,140
Are you all right?

210
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,220
My mother! I want my mother!

211
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,858
I want my mother!

212
00:08:30,859 --> 00:08:32,698
The girl looks clean.

213
00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:34,259
Why won't you take her?

214
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,340
Bah!

215
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:37,580
I'm not running a charity home here.

216
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,899
She is just a kid.

217
00:08:38,939 --> 00:08:41,379
It will take years
before I can make money with her.

218
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,859
It's not like money grows on trees.

219
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,379
Have a look.

220
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:47,180
She is sure to become a beauty.

221
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,619
She will grow just fine with any food.

222
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,019
- Let me take a closer look.
- Mother!

223
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,739
- She has quite a temper.
- I want my mother!

224
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,578
Get back here!

225
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:58,060
Don't run off!

226
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,058
Stay still!

227
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:00,659
From now on, she is your mother!

228
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,340
You can spare me the act.

229
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,659
I'll take 20,000 copper coins.

230
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:07,979
Fine.

231
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:10,739
Make sure you bring me a fortune,
little girl.

232
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,540
- I want my mother!
- Stay still.

233
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:14,340
Get up!

234
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:17,259
I'll train you well.

235
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:20,280
(He Wenning)

236
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:28,540
Miss He,

237
00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:30,460
do you not like the food?

238
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,899
And you almost ate the bowl.

239
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,259
Of course the food is good.

240
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,420
It's just that

241
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:38,259
I grew up in the theater.

242
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,979
When I gained any weight,
I'd get beaten.

243
00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:43,220
I've gotten used to my small appetite.

244
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,379
You are now a free woman.

245
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:48,180
Eat your fill.

246
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,820
Drink anything you like.

247
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:52,139
Yeah!

248
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,060
Well said.

249
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,820
I shall eat my fill today.

250
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,700
Eat up.

251
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:07,379
I regained my freedom

252
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:09,460
with your help.

253
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,298
Whether you'll remember or not,

254
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:13,178
wherever you go,

255
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,060
I'll have your back.

256
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:24,019
I noticed

257
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:26,420
you haven't eaten anything today.

258
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:28,259
I bought you tanghulu.

259
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,659
Try it out.

260
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,060
I was only not feeling well.

261
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:44,499
I saw the records of missing persons

262
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:45,899
in the file.

263
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:48,540
All those names...

264
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,739
Some died a horrible death.

265
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,139
Some lived a miserable life.

266
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,659
I went missing as a kid.

267
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,859
I wonder if my name was recorded

268
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,180
in a file too.

269
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:01,859
I thought

270
00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:03,099
I was old enough

271
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,779
to leave the theater
and regain my freedom.

272
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,379
But then,

273
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:10,899
I jumped from one cage to another.

274
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,659
When I travel with you,

275
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:14,979
I feel the most at ease.

276
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,300
I often have dreams

277
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,779
of the happy memories

278
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,700
I had with my parents

279
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,859
before being abducted as a kid.

280
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:26,139
Maybe they are waiting for me
to come home.

281
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:29,580
But I don't remember my way home.

282
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,739
Had I not been sold off,

283
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,739
I would still remember
my parents' faces.

284
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:36,859
At least I'll have a family

285
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,580
in my memory.

286
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,859
You may not have a family in the past,

287
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:43,460
but if you want,

288
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:45,139
you can have one now.

289
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,619
Really?

290
00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:50,820
Yes.

291
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,619
Look at you two.

292
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,979
How could you do this?

293
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,859
I...

294
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:05,300
What did I do wrong?

295
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:07,659
You reek of sweetness.

296
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,859
Are you...

297
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,499
snacking on tanghulu without me?

298
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,058
The tanghulu is on me. Eat up.

299
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:19,220
That's more like it.

300
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:21,139
I bought these for He Wenning.

301
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,379
Miss He doesn't like desserts.

302
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,800
