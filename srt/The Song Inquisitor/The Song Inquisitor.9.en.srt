1
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,420
=The Song Inquisitor=

2
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,940
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,610
You didn't kill him,

4
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,771
yet you sacrificed yourself
to take the blame.

5
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,370
What are you hiding?

6
00:00:54,461 --> 00:00:55,851
Kill me or torture me,

7
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,771
it's up to you.

8
00:00:58,461 --> 00:01:00,650
Mr. Li's eyes today...

9
00:01:00,821 --> 00:01:02,219
Back when I worked in the theater,

10
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,160
I only saw two types of people
with similar eyes.

11
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,971
One type

12
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,411
had given up on life.

13
00:01:07,061 --> 00:01:08,131
The other

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,051
was ready to elope.

15
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,420
So, who is it that you're willing

16
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:14,810
to sacrifice to protect?

17
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,810
It was me who killed him.

18
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:19,851
I have no regrets.

19
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,971
What a delicious pig's trotter!

20
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:33,491
What a shame about this guy.

21
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:35,739
He has such good facial features.

22
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,980
(Criminal Huang Santai)

23
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:38,251
Look at those eyes.

24
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,090
Peach blossom eyes.

25
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,179
And his mouth,

26
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,530
like an ingot.

27
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,570
He's someone destined for fortune.

28
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,491
Tang Wan!

29
00:01:52,701 --> 00:01:53,579
At first glance,

30
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,971
her features don't seem to match.

31
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,930
But if you cover the other parts,

32
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,771
the eyes resemble much like Tang Wan's.

33
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:02,810
You're right.

34
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,780
You're looking for Tang Wan?

35
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:08,100
She left today.

36
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:08,940
She has left?

37
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:11,011
With all this chaos in the mansion,

38
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,540
it's normal if no one stays.

39
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,491
If I'm not mistaken,

40
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,571
Li Shaoren hasn't married yet.

41
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:18,211
This mansion

42
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:19,739
will have no one to inherit, right?

43
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,690
Yes.

44
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,140
According to Song Dynasty Law,

45
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:24,499
this mansion will become
the property of the authorities.

46
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,739
As a servant of this mansion,
why could she leave?

47
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,179
She volunteered to serve here

48
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,820
and never signed a servant contract.

49
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:31,459
With such a tragedy in the mansion,

50
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,530
there's nothing I can do
to stop her from leaving.

51
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:41,291
Tang Wan didn't steal,
nor did she seem to hold any grudges.

52
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,891
Why do you all suspect her
of killing Baron Li?

53
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:49,771
(I already know)

54
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:51,331
(the past matters.)

55
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:53,339
(As a son,)

56
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,810
(I have nothing to explain.)

57
00:02:55,701 --> 00:02:58,051
(Let's leave this place of trouble)

58
00:02:58,101 --> 00:02:59,571
(and seek a new life,)

59
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,100
(letting the hatred dissipate here.)

60
00:03:02,101 --> 00:03:03,731
(In this vast world,)

61
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,771
(I will protect you
for the rest of your life.)

62
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:10,370
Father.

63
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,760
(Tomb of Liu Yi and Huang Santai)
Mother.

64
00:03:15,981 --> 00:03:17,611
The avenge is not yet done.

65
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,250
Once my hatred is satisfied,

66
00:03:22,701 --> 00:03:23,850
we can

67
00:03:25,701 --> 00:03:27,690
reunite as a family.

68
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:32,011
Be careful.

69
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,250
Don't fall.

70
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,619
Your father taught you mimicry

71
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,899
to bring joy and laughter

72
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,530
into your life.

73
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:54,980
But instead, you used it

74
00:03:54,981 --> 00:03:57,171
to cover up murder.

75
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,100
Tang Wan, even though Baron Li escaped
from his committed crimes,

76
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:01,611
he could have been punished by the law.

77
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,600
Yet you've followed
in your father's footsteps,

78
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,860
this is so foolish.

79
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:06,530
When Li Kangde

80
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,331
caused my parents' deaths,

81
00:04:10,261 --> 00:04:12,810
there's no one called him evil.

82
00:04:13,221 --> 00:04:15,331
No one sought justice for me.

83
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:17,771
I'm just returning the favor.

84
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,970
Why am I wrong?

85
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,090
If you're truly evil,

86
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,011
why did you help me
when I was in trouble?

87
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,240
Even when you tampered with the
water pouch that I set as a trap,

88
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,211
you used a narcotic drug,

89
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:33,131
not a poison.

90
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,530
You even couldn't bear it
when you saw dirt smudges on my face.

91
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:46,211
Someone as graceful
and thoughtful as you

92
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,850
wouldn't voluntarily live
in disguise for so many years.

93
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,811
From now on,

94
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,011
you don't need to hide anymore.

95
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,290
We'll leave this place of trouble

96
00:05:08,661 --> 00:05:09,931
and

97
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,771
we'll never part.

98
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:32,811
You killed to avenge your parents,

99
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:36,100
but now Li Shaoren wants
to sacrifice himself desperately.

100
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:37,891
What did he do wrong?

101
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,811
You're not evil,

102
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:43,891
you simply lost control and misled.

103
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,090
I never expected

104
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,931
someone could

105
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,771
love another so much

106
00:05:51,981 --> 00:05:54,331
that he'd gladly sacrifice for her.

107
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:10,011
We want to overturn the verdict.

108
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,939
The person the servant

109
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,499
saw passing by the wall

110
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,730
disguised as a headless ghost that night
could not be Li Shaoren.

111
00:06:16,781 --> 00:06:18,819
It was someone of
a similar height to Baron Li,

112
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,011
Tang Wan.

113
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:29,170
Tang Wan,

114
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,730
you mimicked Baron Li's voice
to confuse everyone.

115
00:06:34,021 --> 00:06:36,730
You hid yourself so well.

116
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,650
You are such a pretty.

117
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,771
Do you still remember

118
00:07:02,101 --> 00:07:03,530
Huang Santai?

119
00:07:12,661 --> 00:07:13,850
Where's my father?

120
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,571
He's gone.

121
00:07:25,901 --> 00:07:27,730
I made

122
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,131
a mistake.

123
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,771
It's fine.

124
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:55,299
The alkaline smell Wang Ling
detected the next day was from

125
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,050
the lye water you used
to wash away bloodstains.

126
00:07:58,381 --> 00:08:00,280
Tang Wan disguised herself
as the headless ghost

127
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,980
and staged Baron Li's death scene,

128
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,331
hoping to frame
those performing the exorcism.

129
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,050
But, it turned out

130
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,371
that the disaster

131
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:09,691
fell onto my brother, Wang Ling instead.

132
00:08:11,661 --> 00:08:13,011
You carefully planned

133
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:14,410
the murder for a long time.

134
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:17,850
The ghostly appearances at Li Mansion
were all your doing.

135
00:08:18,221 --> 00:08:20,131
The only reason
you didn't kill him earlier

136
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,451
was probably

137
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,211
because of him.

138
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,970
After my parents' wrongful deaths,

139
00:08:28,861 --> 00:08:30,290
I have been

140
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:32,811
wandering from place to place.

141
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,931
Vengeance

142
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,211
was my sole reason to live.

143
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,010
Until the day Li Mansion
recruited maids,

144
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,480
I disguised myself as ugly
and joined the mansion.

145
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,010
I waited for my chance

146
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,171
and

147
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,730
I met him.

148
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,451
You are just a maid.

149
00:09:09,861 --> 00:09:11,211
What are you crying for?

150
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,931
You are a young master.

151
00:09:13,301 --> 00:09:15,130
What are you crying for?

152
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,890
Today is the anniversary
of my mother's death.

153
00:09:22,181 --> 00:09:23,411
Are you

154
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:25,651
missing your loved ones too?

155
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:42,571
Does it sound alike?

156
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:46,811
This is the first time I saw you

157
00:09:48,181 --> 00:09:50,250
smile sincerely, without anger.

158
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,860
I specially asked a blacksmith

159
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,691
to forge these two knives,

160
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,370
but I carved the words on them myself.

161
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,051
One for each of us,

162
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:04,811
symbolizing our unbreakable bond.

163
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,610
I meant for them to protect you,

164
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,051
resembling my firm affection
towards you.

165
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,811
The firm affection

166
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:22,571
ended up as my tool of crime.
