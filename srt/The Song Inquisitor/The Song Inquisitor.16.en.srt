2
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,340
=Episode 16=

3
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,240
Got it?

4
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:49,240
Yes.

5
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:51,240
Song Mutou.

6
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:54,439
Have you identified the victim?

7
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:55,640
It's difficult.

8
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:57,000
No locals have reported it,

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,680
and no one from outside
has come to inquire.

10
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,439
For now, we have no leads.

11
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:03,880
Song.

12
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:06,650
Don't you find it odd? Earlier at
the county administrative office,

13
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,690
the runners seemed like
they wanted to say something.

14
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,100
This morning, a letter arrived claiming

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,560
that Magistrate Wu is connected

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,400
to the deceased's death.

17
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,159
Even if it's to protect
Wu Lao'er's reputation,

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,040
I'll get

19
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,120
to the bottom of this case.

20
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:23,400
Yes,

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,599
Inquisitor Song.

22
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,400
How many times have I told you?

23
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,480
Call me...

24
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:30,799
Song!

25
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,560
That's more like it.

26
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:34,760
Let's go.

27
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,879
They just asked me about this.
Why come again?

28
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,799
This woman paid half a month's rent

29
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,519
but disappeared

30
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,000
after a week.

31
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,319
What's her name?

32
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,120
The register says she's Sun
from Anyang, Hedong.

33
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,920
Did she meet with anyone?

34
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,400
A rather refined man.

35
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,580
I have one word for him.

36
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,760
Handsome.

37
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:06,500
Everyone at the administrative office
knows about this.

38
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,199
That woman arrived half a month ago.

39
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,560
Since then,

40
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,479
Magistrate Wu has been restless.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,759
Once, when I went to see Magistrate Wu,

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,680
I caught them together.

43
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,780
Are you saying

44
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,720
Magistrate Wu knew about this
but didn't report it,

45
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,560
making him a suspect?

46
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,360
I didn't say that.

47
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,400
You did.

48
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,439
But

49
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,599
when we inspected the crime scene,

50
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,520
we found a beaded bracelet

51
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,960
identical to the one

52
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,280
Magistrate Wu usually wears.

53
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,960
When we were students,

54
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,759
you always came out on top.

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,919
Mr. Wu, Madam said

56
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,800
you tend to skip lunch when you're busy.

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,680
She insisted
I ensure you finish your meal.

58
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,599
My wife is a bit strict.

59
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,719
I'll eat first.

60
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:49,319
Tonight, we'll drink

61
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,360
to our hearts' content.

62
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,759
You've found yourself a fine wife.

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,840
She takes

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,560
good care of me.

65
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,199
Try some.

66
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,360
I've already eaten.

67
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,000
You worked so hard
to become an inquisitor.

68
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,680
Why resign now?

69
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,800
It's complicated.

70
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,240
The culprit

71
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,199
behind the body-dumping cases

72
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,039
remains at large,

73
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,560
and they've even tried to implicate me
as a suspect in this case.

74
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,560
You haven't caught the perpetrator?

75
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,840
No.

76
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,840
But they must be someone powerful,

77
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,159
high up in rank.

78
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,840
To stop my investigation,

79
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,319
they've repeatedly tried

80
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,080
to coerce me into resigning.

81
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,159
Song!

82
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,400
Song!

83
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,520
Song.

84
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:33,639
You'd better go.

85
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:34,839
One of your young friends

86
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,000
wants to have a private word with you.

87
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,199
I'll take my leave then.

88
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,120
Song.

89
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,800
I don't think your friend is a good man.

90
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:46,719
Let's go.

91
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,639
We'll talk later.

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,080
Sorry, Song.

93
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,479
I've been too busy.

94
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,960
Let's meet again tomorrow.

95
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,800
All right.

96
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,639
I'll let it slide for today.

97
00:03:57,099 --> 00:03:58,579
Is this the person who came looking

98
00:03:58,719 --> 00:03:59,639
for Sun from Anyang?

99
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,840
Yes.

100
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,599
That's him, the handsome one.

101
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,120
You call that handsome?

102
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,599
You have interesting taste.

103
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,000
He's a handsome man.

104
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,080
Isn't that Wu Lao'er?

105
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,479
All the evidence now points to you.

106
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,839
Why was your beaded bracelet

107
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,800
found at the crime scene?

108
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:23,100
It must have fallen off
while I was investigating the case.

109
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:26,279
But the victim
didn't accidentally drown.

110
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,519
She was murdered.

111
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:29,639
Song Mutou,

112
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,500
you used to say

113
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,660
that no matter how certain
or strange something seems,

114
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,279
one should never rush to conclusions.

115
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,000
Yet now,

116
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,220
you're jumping to conclusions
about someone close to you.

117
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,360
Then tell me.

118
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,879
What's your relationship

119
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,800
with Sun from Anyang?

120
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,879
I still remember. Cheng,

121
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,560
the deceased woman by the river,

122
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,439
now Sun, and I were in love.

123
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,399
She despised me for being a poor scholar

124
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,240
and wrote a letter

125
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,759
to break ties with me.

126
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,680
I became self-destructive
and left for the capital

127
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,590
for the imperial exams.

128
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,680
Though I had no motivation,

129
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,000
I took a chance

130
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,160
and unexpectedly passed.

131
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,160
You've always been
a man of great talent.

132
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,399
Even in despair,
your brilliance couldn't be hidden.

133
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:07,879
Afterward,

134
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,800
I immediately sent someone

135
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:11,120
to deliver the news to Cheng.

136
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,360
But by then,

137
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,480
Cheng had already married someone else.

138
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,000
From that day on,

139
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,920
I felt as though a thorn
had pierced my heart.

140
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,560
Late at night,

141
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,759
it pricks me,

142
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,759
reminding me of what I missed

143
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,120
due to my own incompetence.

144
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,040
When she came to see me that day,

145
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,839
my heart wavered.

146
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,439
But my wife comes

147
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,199
from a respectable official family

148
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,120
and has helped me so much.

149
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,079
Meeting her was merely an attempt

150
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,560
to remove that thorn
I've carried for years.

151
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,120
Why did Cheng choose
such an ominous place?

152
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,800
That day,
I waited but never got to see her.

153
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,319
I truly don't know how she died.

154
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:52,680
Do you believe me,

155
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,000
Song Mutou?

156
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,959
Whether I believe you or not
doesn't matter.

157
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,279
I only trust the evidence.

158
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,660
I'm willing to go to prison

159
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,040
to prove my innocence.

160
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:04,600
But you must give me justice.

161
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,759
Song.

162
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,000
Look here.

163
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,920
Maybe that Sun fell accidentally

164
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,279
during the night?

165
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,360
No.

166
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,399
These marks suggest she was pushed.

167
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,659
(Huang Jirou, Wife of Magistrate Wu)
Inquisitor Song, right?

168
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,759
I've often heard my father mention you.

169
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,879
Your father is Huang Weijun,

170
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,260
the Chief Councillor in Lin'An?

171
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,959
I'm ashamed.

172
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,959
Even out here
in this remote countryside,

173
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,759
I still rely on my father's influence.

174
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,759
The Chief Councillor
is a high-ranking official.

175
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:16,499
Yet his daughter married
only a magistrate.

176
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,000
My husband is modest

177
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,160
and avoids bragging.

178
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:23,160
He fears others would say
his success came from my family.

179
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,079
Back then, he was a spirited man.

180
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,040
Every girl who saw him would be smitten.

181
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,959
I begged my family
to propose on my behalf,

182
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,800
but he turned me down.

183
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,600
He said

184
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,600
he already had someone in his heart.

185
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,639
Such loyalty

186
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,199
is rare.

187
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,360
Knowing this, why did you...

188
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,720
It's embarrassing to say,

189
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,560
but I, too, have pride.

190
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:52,279
I sulked at home for months, crying.

191
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,279
My father, furious,

192
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,399
blocked

193
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,319
his career prospects.

194
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,839
I pleaded on his behalf,
defying my father,

195
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,360
and followed him to this backwater place

196
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:08,759
where he became a mere magistrate.

197
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,800
So, it's not that he didn't try.

198
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,319
It's just that

199
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,079
effort alone

200
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,480
doesn't always guarantee success.

201
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,120
Do you know what your husband has done?

202
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,760
He rekindled his affair
with his old flame,

203
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,360
disregarding your devotion.

204
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,360
Dear...

205
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,480
I know all about it.

206
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,560
How could I not be angry?

207
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,120
But even if we're to part ways,

208
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,360
we're still husband and wife.

209
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,840
I must get him out first,
then decide what to do.

210
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,279
That is not for you to decide.

211
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,679
It depends on the evidence.

212
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,279
Of course.

213
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,799
I only hope Inquisitor Song

214
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,080
won't make things difficult for him.

215
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,799
Otherwise...

216
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,360
I won't spare anyone.

217
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,519
And by "anyone,"

218
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,919
I mean all of you.

219
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,480
I don't trouble the innocent,

220
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,759
but I won't let

221
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,360
any wrongdoers go free either.

222
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,360
Knowing her husband is cheating,

223
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,820
yet blaming us for being harsh.

224
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,639
Song's kindness is wasted here.

225
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,960
You already knew
Magistrate Wu isn't the killer.

226
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:25,619
Then why haven't you released him?

227
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,840
He's not the killer?

228
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,759
Seven upright,
five seated, three at ease.

229
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,039
When standing,

230
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,840
a person's height is about seven times
the length of their foot.

231
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,519
Based on this,

232
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,000
the person's height

233
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,600
is at most five feet.

234
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,159
It's not Wu Lao'er.

235
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,279
Nor is it the victim, Sun.

236
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,600
So, you wanted to lure

237
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,039
the snake out of its hole.

238
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,600
Looking at Huang Jirou earlier,

239
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,759
her height appears
to be around five feet.

240
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,000
She

241
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,240
does have motive.

242
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,240
Madam,

243
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,960
where were you

244
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,480
on the day of the incident?

245
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,879
I won't make things difficult for you.

246
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,559
Since you're trying
to save your old friend,

247
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,320
I'll answer.

248
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:11,960
That day,

249
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,919
I was at home
playing jianzi with the maids

250
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,519
and lost quite a bit of money to them.

251
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,559
Mrs. Wu, you're truly magnanimous.

252
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,279
Knowing your husband
was out having an affair,

253
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,600
yet still in the mood to play games.

254
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,039
Whether I knew or not,

255
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,559
it's all in the past.

256
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:31,320
Men are like dogs.

257
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,559
Give them some slack,
and they'll run off.

258
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,639
Just pull them back.

259
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:40,879
Why dig too deep?

260
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,879
Wouldn't knowing what he did

261
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,159
just disgust oneself?

262
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:46,639
All right.

263
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,600
If you have no further questions,

264
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,000
please leave.

265
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:54,399
You're determined, Inquisitor Song.

266
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,759
Then let's see who can save

267
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,519
my husband first.

268
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:01,039
