00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,340
=Episode 14=

3
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,679
I never ask for help empty-handed.

4
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:50,280
I know

5
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:52,520
you don't care about my support for you,

6
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:53,759
nor do you care

7
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,200
about wealth

8
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:56,840
and career advancement.

9
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,679
But you care

10
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,159
about those young people.

11
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,799
You and Yang Hewen set this up

12
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,040
to conclude
that they broke into Yang Residence

13
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:08,319
to find the truth.

14
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:10,200
Then, you'll charge them

15
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:12,319
with trespassing.

16
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,400
Song Ci.

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,640
Don't think I'm threatening you.

18
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,359
I'm saving you.

19
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,000
If the main culprit
isn't brought to justice,

20
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:23,239
more innocent children
will die tragically.

21
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,640
There will be more people like me

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,280
who will be framed as murderers.

23
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,719
Evil is like a flood

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,640
that can't be stopped.

25
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,120
You can protect your official position,

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,280
but can you also uphold your conscience?

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,760
We found proof.

28
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,240
Hurry and report to the authorities.

29
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,550
We've been searching for so long,

30
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,640
but not a single servant patrolled.

31
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,599
We're doomed.

32
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,400
- What are you doing here?
- We're doomed!

33
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,159
- Get them!
- Run!

34
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,439
The Song Dynasty law states

35
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,650
that anyone who trespasses
another person's residence

36
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,639
can be killed without mercy.

37
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,960
Go.

38
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,960
If it had been any later,

39
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,159
they

40
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,919
might have been beaten to death.

41
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,080
What do you want to do?

42
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,400
Report to the authorities.

43
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,120
Case closed.

44
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,400
Resign as Inspector of Criminal Justice.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,150
(Submitted by Song Ci)
I've prepared the letter for you.

46
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,080
Tea

47
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,919
is getting cold.

48
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,599
Stop!

49
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,240
Stop!

50
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,599
You really like my residence.

51
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,280
Don't move.

52
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,520
Beat him up too.

53
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,560
Who dares to do so?

54
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,439
Song Dynasty law states

55
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,039
that anyone who trespasses
without reason at night,

56
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,000
and the owner subdues

57
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,900
but still injures or kills
the trespasser,

58
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,200
the owner shall be sentenced
to penal servitude and exile!

59
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,080
If

60
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,439
we can't get out of here alive today,

61
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,759
someone will go after you relentlessly

62
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,399
and make you suffer forever

63
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:25,079
until you are sentenced

64
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,399
to death.

65
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,279
See justice from King Yan

66
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,639
after you turn into ashes then!

67
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,100
(Inspector of Criminal Justice)
I'm Song Dynasty's inspector!

68
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:37,720
Who dares
to harm the people, violate justice,

69
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:40,120
and kill lives?

70
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,560
Good kid.

71
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,920
Endure it.

72
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,600
Does it hurt?

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,959
Song.

74
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,240
You're like my mother.

75
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,639
If your parents knew,

76
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,680
how should I explain to them?

77
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,680
You came to save us today,

78
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:30,160
kept us warm and fed along the way,

79
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:32,759
and treat me as well as my mother.

80
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,240
If they were alive,

81
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,160
they'd be as grateful as I am.

82
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,560
If you hadn't been protecting me,

83
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,279
I could still help you.

84
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,199
And you wouldn't have suffered
so many injuries.

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,319
Don't you
care about your looks the most?

86
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,600
Wouldn't you be even more grumpy

87
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,240
if you were bruised and scarred?

88
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,519
I can't afford that.

89
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,720
It's none of your business.

90
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:07,879
You can make it

91
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,680
my business

92
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,600
or control me.

93
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,879
I'm not afraid of anything.

94
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,279
I want

95
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,199
to find out

96
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,040
and clear their name

97
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,519
with all of you

98
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,639
and with you.

99
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,519
Song.

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,240
You exposed your identity
in front of the people today.

101
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,600
Will you be in danger?

102
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,959
I wanted to use your identity

103
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,399
to hide myself

104
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:05,959
and secretly investigate

105
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,360
the clues of the corpse dumping case.

106
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,120
But along the way

107
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:13,480
I saw your persistence

108
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,680
and how you prioritize righteousness.

109
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,680
I seemed to see the old me,

110
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,480
who isn't afraid of anything

111
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,199
except regret and injustice.

112
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,079
Today you fell into the bad guys' trap

113
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,120
and almost got killed.

114
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,519
It's my fault
for getting you all involved.

115
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,319
Forgive me.

116
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,120
I blame you.

117
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,839
I blame you
for pulling me out of the fire pit

118
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,279
and letting me
live the life everyone deserves.

119
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,959
I also blame you

120
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,120
for feeding me.

121
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:50,000
What if I starve again?

122
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,519
Inquisitor Song.

123
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,279
You said

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,920
you seemed to see your old self.

125
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,560
Yes.

126
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,199
If you see him again,

127
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,519
what would you say to him?

128
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,160
Keep holding on.

129
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,240
You made the right choice.

130
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,519
The world

131
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,680
needs someone like you.

132
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,480
I will send this resignation letter

133
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,399
to the government now.

134
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,040
Is it worth it

135
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,639
for these kids?

136
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,160
I've only known them
for more than a month,

137
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,120
but they're like family to me.

138
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,759
I've known someone
for more than ten years,

139
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,559
but we're like strangers.

140
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,279
We have no ties with each other,

141
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,720
but we concern about each other.

142
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,320
If my life is in danger,

143
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:50,240
they will make the same choice.

144
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,360
However,

145
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,639
one person like me

146
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,399
is enough.

147
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,440
Say,

148
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:12,759
what if the bad guys
come after us again?

149
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,440
We need to protect Inquisitor Song well.

150
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,960
But let's make a deal.

151
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,200
You can't abandon me

152
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,799
just because of Inquisitor Song.

153
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,800
And you can't abandon me

154
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,159
just because you have a lover.

155
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,440
What lover?

156
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,149
Do you think I'm a fool?

157
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,150
Do you think I don't know

158
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,700
what's going on between you and Miss He?

159
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,879
Alright.

160
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,840
Instead of studying food and drink

161
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,039
and the case,

162
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,399
you think about this.

163
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,519
Yeah.

164
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,899
I have it all figured out.

165
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,919
I will write an opera

166
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,840
about your experience with Miss He

167
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,440
and our experience with Inquisitor Song.

168
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,799
We'll sing and act well.

169
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,120
We never have to starve anymore.

170
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,320
Sure.

171
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:51,320
This case is called

172
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,759
Dog Murder.

173
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:53,639
We can't

174
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,279
let the villains win in the end.

175
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,440
If these stories of exoneration

176
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,639
and grievances

177
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,919
can be passed on from person to person,
spread by word of mouth,

178
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,320
and serve as a warning
to future generations,

179
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:05,759
we

180
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,960
will not have lived in vain.

181
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,720
You two grown men

182
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,200
are being sentimental again.

183
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,000
You guys are waiting here

184
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,400
because you don't want
Inquisitor Song to leave, aren't you?

185
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,600
I also felt

186
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,440
that Inquisitor Song

187
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,159
seemed to be
bidding us farewell just now.

188
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,360
Is Inquisitor Song leaving?
Where is he going?

189
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,519
I haven't packed my stuff yet.

190
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,360
You must be teasing me.

191
