00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:50,730
Song.

4
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:52,730
Could you tell us the timeline

5
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:54,450
of this mysterious case?

6
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:00,578
How can I assist you?

7
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:01,699
Sir,

8
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,458
there are so many people in that place.

9
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,289
They were all crying.

10
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:09,289
I was so scared.

11
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,649
Where is that place?

12
00:01:13,179 --> 00:01:14,490
It's inside

13
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,018
a hidden and big courtyard.

14
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:21,529
There is a mean and nasty old man.

15
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,050
What else did you see?

16
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:31,330
Unless you tell me,

17
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,859
more kids like you

18
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,809
will be hurt by those bad guys.

19
00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:45,449
Don't be afraid.

20
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:48,529
I'll keep you safe.

21
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:49,850
All right?

22
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:53,619
I heard

23
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,289
that someone was beaten to death

24
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,970
because they bit the old man.

25
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,779
They drag the body to the mountain

26
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,169
and buried it.

27
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,649
Inquisitor Song,

28
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,098
we found more bodies.

29
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:08,730
There were mutilated children.

30
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,699
Bring the kid somewhere safe.

31
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,849
Yes.

32
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:17,809
Sir.

33
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:21,058
Sir, you have to save me.

34
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:22,898
I don't want to die.

35
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:26,050
I have so many things I want to do.

36
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:33,809
Don't be afraid.

37
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:36,849
I'll keep you safe.

38
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:41,849
Wait here until I come back.

39
00:02:50,339 --> 00:02:52,040
(Atractylodes Rhizome, Honey Locust)
Write it down.

40
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,610
The third year of Chunyou Era, June 2.

41
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,809
The corpse of a little girl was found

42
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,699
at the hills of Mount Xiyao.

43
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,259
The mouth, the nose,

44
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,778
the belly, and ribs

45
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:02,170
show a green shade.

46
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:03,738
It shows that the deceased

47
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:06,290
has been dead for over ten days.

48
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,210
Marks of strangling at the neck.

49
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,089
Drag marks on the back.

50
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:12,578
She was dragged to the mountain

51
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:14,290
after she was murdered.

52
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,649
Ask around.

53
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,139
See if anyone has gone there

54
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,578
in the past ten days.

55
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:20,570
- Yes.
- Right away.

56
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:23,330
This is the fourth wave of victims.

57
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,809
The other boys and girls

58
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,539
were found in Anyang County,

59
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,610
Xingrong County, Linchuan County,

60
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:33,529
and Guichi County.

61
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,939
A local blacksmith, Zhao Er.

62
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,129
He was drunk when he killed her
by accident.

63
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:45,770
What about the missing body part?

64
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,170
He ran amok after he got drunk.

65
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,010
He doesn't remember a thing.

66
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,089
But how did Zhao Er die?

67
00:03:53,619 --> 00:03:54,939
The coroner examined the wound.

68
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,379
He hung himself.

69
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,610
His cellmate can testify.

70
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,219
The eyes are closed.

71
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,490
The lips are dark.

72
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:05,610
The teeth are visible.

73
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:08,099
The strangle mark is
under Adam's apple.

74
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,338
The tongue is dangling.

75
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:11,129
He did hang himself.

76
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,819
Did you see him take his life?

77
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,929
Yeah.

78
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:17,330
He went through a lot of trouble.

79
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,618
Why didn't you stop him?

80
00:04:18,619 --> 00:04:19,849
Why should I?

81
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,579
He was a fiend who killed a girl.

82
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,899
I am glad he took his life.

83
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,570
Stopping would have sullied our hands!

84
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,750
(The mountain, riverside, forest, tree
hollow child corpse cases: Closed)

85
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:33,969
Where is the girl?

86
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,839
(Anyang County, Xingrong County,
Linchuan County, Guichi County, Lin'an)

87
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,579
(Jia's Residence)

88
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,779
Isn't that Jia Zhen?

89
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,339
Vice Minister Jia, welcome back.

90
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,849
Thank you. I'll be heading inside now.

91
00:05:13,299 --> 00:05:15,450
Vice Minister Jia is such
a wise gentleman.

92
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,890
He is righteous and virtuous.
No wonder people respect him.

93
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,870
(Jia Zhen)

94
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,969
Now that Song Ci is jailed,

95
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,539
has there been anything unusual?

96
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,049
He is guarded.
He can't cause any trouble.

97
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,099
(When I was little,)

98
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,579
(I escaped at night.)

99
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,938
I could hear the crows caw.

100
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:20,498
So, I asked Wang Ling

101
00:06:20,499 --> 00:06:22,770
to go where the crows congregate.

102
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,529
It's me.

103
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:27,779
Your guess is right.

104
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,729
Two days before we arrived,

105
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:31,979
someone went to the mountain
full of crows

106
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,378
to dig up the corpse.

107
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:34,849
How did you find out?

108
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,698
Just like the roasted chicken.

109
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:37,738
I got it from our peer.

110
00:06:37,739 --> 00:06:39,330
Who was it?

111
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,498
Before I joined the troupe,

112
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:44,409
I was a beggar.

113
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,010
Come, have some roasted chicken.

114
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:52,049
Buddy.

115
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:53,210
Buddy?

116
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:58,099
Do you remember
who carried the crate away

117
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,178
two days ago?

118
00:06:59,179 --> 00:07:00,489
Two days ago?

119
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:03,859
It was late at night.

120
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,930
It was at least the Hours of Rat.

121
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:07,738
(I could barely see a thing.)

122
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:08,818
(All I saw)

123
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,609
(was the big red crate.)

124
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,019
(They carried the crate)

125
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,810
(and headed for the south gate.)

126
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,339
I bet the crate

127
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,849
was carrying something valuable.

128
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:19,250
So, I tailed them.

129
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:20,099
(And then,)

130
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,459
(they moved
to several different places.)

131
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,498
I followed

132
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:25,019
the directions I got from my pals

133
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,378
and tailed them.

134
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,450
Could you take us there?

135
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,459
It's a pond in the middle of nowhere.

136
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,489
I bet it's full of treasure.

137
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,099
Bones!

138
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,099
Calm down.

139
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:42,899
Don't be afraid.

140
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,378
I used to be afraid of these.

141
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:45,659
But I got used to it.

142
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,010
Calm down.

143
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,570
Inquisitor Song

144
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:51,010
suspects someone is protecting
the mastermind.

145
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,409
The person they all
have connections with

146
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:56,539
is the Vice Minister Jia Zhen

147
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,849
who wields immense power.

148
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,219
We know what you are

149
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,378
trying to accomplish.

150
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:09,729
We find it impressive.

151
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,459
We are too scared and powerless,

152
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,489
but we are not heartless.

153
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,070
(We found the remains. Wait for us.)

154
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,050
- Wonderful!
- Incredible!

155
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,778
- Great!
- Amazing show!

156
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:41,778
Great!

157
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:44,930
- Wonderful!
- Yeah!

158
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:50,050
- Great work!
- Amazing singing!

159
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,009
Every day Song spends in jail

160
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,930
is another day of suffering.

161
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,089
We found the clues.

162
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:58,089
Now, we must overturn the case.

163
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:00,650
When we suffered injustice,

164
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,059
it was Song who saved us.

165
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,778
- Great
- Yeah!

166
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:06,249
This time,

167
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,249
we shall return the favor.

168
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:10,089
Zhao Zhiting.

169
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:12,210
Aren't you a great playwright?

170
00:09:13,739 --> 00:09:14,889
Yeah!

171
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,410
Yeah!

172
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:18,210
Great!

173
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,650
The case with the lotus mark

174
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,050
is now spread across the city.

175
00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:32,760
(Emperor Lizong of Song)
I thought the children died in accidents.

176
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,330
Your Majesty,

177
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:38,498
It was an opera arranged
by a group of actors.

178
00:09:38,499 --> 00:09:41,369
They are performing it for free.

179
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,378
What is the opera about?

180
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:46,059
There were curious
and fascinating cases.

181
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,378
First, a ghost troupe.

182
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,459
Then, a headless corpse
and a dog's corpse.

183
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,129
And now, the case with the lotus mark.

184
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:54,849
People in the palace

185
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,050
have been talking about it.

186
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,299
The case

187
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,450
must have involved
a great amount of injustice.

188
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,849
Years of enduring.

189
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:11,050
Years of search
for missing persons and evidence.

190
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:14,650
