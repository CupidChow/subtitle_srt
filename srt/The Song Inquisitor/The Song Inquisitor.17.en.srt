=The Song Inquisitor=

2
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,340
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,419
Miss He,

4
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,578
you were whipped. You need rest.

5
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:50,978
How can I?

6
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:53,409
A tiny mistake and they beat you
within an inch of your life.

7
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,658
By the way, why have you been doing
all the purchasing lately? Where is Qi?

8
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:57,698
Qi?

9
00:00:57,699 --> 00:00:59,658
He's been missing for several days now.

10
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,179
That one never feared getting beaten.

11
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,810
Why did Inquisitor Song
want us to follow them?

12
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,539
He said she stood
in the front row that day.

13
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,819
She's clearly someone in charge.

14
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,579
But she was trembling.

15
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,019
The others didn't seem

16
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,698
to respect her, either.

17
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,099
She's probably someone new.

18
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,530
Taking over for someone else.

19
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:17,659
Inquisitor Song said

20
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,218
if a murder was committed,

21
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:21,179
Huang Jirou wouldn't have acted herself.

22
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:21,978
She would've ordered

23
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:24,409
her closest servant to do it.

24
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:27,930
Dear.

25
00:01:34,139 --> 00:01:35,489
Dear.

26
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:36,939
He tolerates even this.

27
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,698
Let go of your savior complex.

28
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,569
Respect others' fates.

29
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:42,338
Do you think she already knew

30
00:01:42,339 --> 00:01:44,849
Sun would go to her husband?

31
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,058
Why have expenses gone up so much

32
00:02:03,059 --> 00:02:04,409
since the previous months?

33
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,058
The clothes purchased recently

34
00:02:07,059 --> 00:02:08,498
were all ordered from Lin'an.

35
00:02:08,499 --> 00:02:10,459
Madam specifically requested it.

36
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,610
That's why they cost more
than local goods.

37
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:13,859
And this here?

38
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,050
Why did you pay the fish seller so much?

39
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:18,210
You're not skimming, are you?

40
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:19,378
That…

41
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,129
You'd better ask Madam.

42
00:02:21,499 --> 00:02:23,050
Do you think I don't dare?

43
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,618
You usually don't bother
with these matters.

44
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:26,778
Why the sudden concern

45
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,930
in our household finances now?

46
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,689
Planning to run off

47
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:33,218
with someone again,

48
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,409
this time with the money?

49
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,650
I've already done enough for you.

50
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,889
Stop breaking my heart.

51
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,650
Come in, Song Mutou.

52
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:56,090
Still mad at me?

53
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,739
I did send you to prison.

54
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,699
We've been classmates for so many years.

55
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,330
Don't I know your nature
and temperament by now?

56
00:03:10,339 --> 00:03:11,299
Mr. Wu,

57
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,530
this is lunch prepared by Madam.

58
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,778
Leave us.

59
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:16,050
She said…

60
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:29,259
Watching others fish,

61
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,090
only to envy the fisher.

62
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,419
Do you know how much

63
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,098
I desire the position

64
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:35,689
you intend to resign from?

65
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,098
Wu Lao'er,

66
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:41,969
you've never been fond of fish.

67
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,689
Perhaps my wife is still upset with me.

68
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,610
She knows I don't eat fish,

69
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,449
yet the household's been
buying so much of it lately.

70
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,778
Now that you've said that,

71
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:54,289
I feel like eating it.

72
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,729
Thank you.

73
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,179
Song.

74
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,058
Qi confessed. Turns out he'd been hiding
at the fish seller's place.

75
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:04,530
Qi?

76
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,370
I should've known it was him.

77
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:09,299
No one else could've known

78
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,899
I reunited with Cheng.

79
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,658
The killer wasn't after

80
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,849
wealth or lust.

81
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:19,019
All they did was leave
a wooden mandarin duck hairpin on the body.

82
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,850
A wooden mandarin duck hairpin?

83
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,338
The very one I gave my wife long ago.

84
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:30,250
That was her warning to me.

85
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,129
I have to get to the bottom of this.

86
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,170
Excuse me.

87
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,139
Song.

88
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,050
You've eaten already, but I haven't.

89
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,410
Hungry again?

90
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,730
Here are two confessions.

91
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:51,170
One of them is enough

92
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,410
to convict you.

93
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,449
The one implicating me

94
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,170
must be

95
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,009
from my dear husband, correct?

96
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,730
You're so certain it's him.

97
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:06,529
My servant is foolish,

98
00:05:06,859 --> 00:05:09,089
but my husband is clever.

99
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,298
It's not his cleverness

100
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:12,610
I fear,

101
00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:15,009
but his arrogance.

102
00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:17,050
For a man like this,

103
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:18,930
is it really worth it?

104
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,410
Indeed.

105
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:22,089
Was it worth it?

106
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,160
This is a letter
my husband wrote to that woman.

107
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,960
(If the love of two can last for aye,)
He's never said such words to me,

108
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,480
(they need not be together night and day.)
never written me such love letters.

109
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,209
Do you know

110
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,810
how much

111
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:37,529
it hurt

112
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:39,649
to see these?

113
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:44,410
How I wish those letters
had been written to me.

114
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:47,610
Even a single word meant for me
would have sufficed.

115
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,819
I heard

116
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,410
you're a playwright.

117
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,930
Write this story,

118
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:59,089
and let the world judge.

119
00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:00,769
What is love,

120
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,610
really?

121
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,490
I just picked these flowers.
Aren't they beautiful?

122
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,810
They are.

123
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,370
You've really started
writing their story?

124
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,930
Goodbyes are easy.

125
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,569
Meeting again is hard.

126
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:34,170
Why not

127
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,850
write this story down,

128
00:06:35,859 --> 00:06:37,610
honoring the fact they met at all?

129
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,579
If Sun

130
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,858
hadn't left Wu for wealth,

131
00:06:42,859 --> 00:06:46,000
if Magistrate Wu
hadn't married Huang Jirou

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,720
for her status
and settled into mediocrity,

133
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,978
if Huang Jirou hadn't clung

134
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,059
to Wu's looks and talent,

135
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,538
would the story

136
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,329
have ended differently?

137
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,819
If love

138
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,379
weren't tangled with fame, money,

139
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,970
status, or appearance,

140
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:04,098
perhaps all three could have had

141
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:06,209
their own happy endings.

142
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,930
Instead,
it became a tragedy for them all.

143
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,850
How do you want me to write it?

144
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,810
Write it as it happened.

145
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,619
Let people reflect
and learn to cherish what they have.

146
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,019
I'd rather write it

147
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,689
the way you imagined it.

148
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,449
Everyone has their own struggles
and sorrows.

149
00:07:23,299 --> 00:07:24,569
If they could find

150
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:27,050
some hope and beauty in the story,

151
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:28,730
wouldn't that be better?

152
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,209
Smell this.

153
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,170
Come in.

154
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,579
Why is it such a mess in here?

155
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,529
My wife brought
all the servants with her.

156
00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:00,689
Now that she's gone,

157
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,730
they don't care about me anymore.

158
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:07,658
I…

159
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:09,129
Song Ci.

160
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:12,329
I studied hard for 20 years,

161
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:15,930
only to lose to a word
from a powerful official.

162
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:17,970
If I hadn't given in and married her,

163
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,738
I wouldn't even have
this magistrate's position.

164
00:08:20,739 --> 00:08:23,098
How did you end up like this?

165
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,379
Not everyone can be like you.

166
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,449
Not everyone can achieve what you have.

167
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:30,810
Let me give you a piece of advice.

168
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,538
Stop investigating the case
of the abandoned bodies.

169
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,809
Why make such a fuss
over the deaths of a few rural children?

170
00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:39,570
Too many lives lost,

171
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,529
and too many lies told.

172
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,289
Do you truly think
this can just be ignored?

173
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:46,409
Let me tell you, Wu Lao'er.

174
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:47,850
I will get

175
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,009
to the bottom of this case.

176
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,529
You're right.

177
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:56,529
Not everyone can be like Song Ci.

178
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:01,769
Your wife

179
00:09:02,539 --> 00:09:04,450
told me something.

180
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:06,250
When you passed the imperial exam

181
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,769
and drank too much, you talked
recklessly about national policies,

182
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,809
the Emperor's spies took note.

183
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,169
She admired you then

184
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:16,929
and begged her father to intercede.

185
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,019
Preventing you from joining
the imperial court

186
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,169
was to keep you out of trouble.

187
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,889
They assigned you to this remote post

188
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,649
after things calmed down.

189
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,619
She hoped you'd live in peace here.

190
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,970
That woman has a mind full of schemes.

191
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,570
She's trying to guilt me again.

192
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:36,850
She said

193
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,970
you're a sensitive man.

194
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:41,769
Telling you would only upset you more,

195
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,730
making you dislike her further.

196
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:45,298
It's up to you

197
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:47,009
to believe her or not.

198
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:52,409
My life has been ruined

199
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:55,099
by two women.

200
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,129
One abandoned me for wealth,

201
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,529
the other has the heart of a snake.

202
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,929
Cheng dared

203
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,458
to look down on me!

204
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:05,529
She's illiterate!

205
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,499
And that viper of a wife.

206
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,979
If I so much as glance at another woman,

207
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,450
she mocks me mercilessly.

208
00:10:12,939 --> 00:10:14,370
But now it's over.

209
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,490
They're all dead.

210
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:18,730
