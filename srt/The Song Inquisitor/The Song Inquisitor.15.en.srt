00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,420
=The Song Inquisitor=

2
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,340
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,799
How foolish.

5
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,890
I didn't have you all
beaten to death the other day,

6
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:00,895
and now you've delivered yourselves
to my doorstep?

7
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:05,159
Fine, I'll fulfill your wish.

8
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,699
Being beaten to death for trespassing
into a private residence

9
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,120
would be your own fault.

10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,120
We didn't trespass
into a private residence

11
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:17,040
but rather a lair
where you carry out your wicked deeds.

12
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,319
You deceive with false words
in the name of the Heming Deity.

13
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,079
Such crimes cannot be forgiven.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Miss He. Officers.

15
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,040
I heard that your investigation
was hindered here,

16
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,480
so I've come to assist.

17
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,920
How amusing.

18
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:37,439
Now any random person dares
to intrude on my estate

19
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,120
as if I, the owner, do not exist?

20
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,439
This estate was reportedly
gifted to you by your followers.

21
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,120
I thought your followers
must be very devout.

22
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,400
I visited the ancestral home
of the Sun family

23
00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:51,100
and discussed this
with their family head.

24
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:52,880
I intended to remove
this blight of society,

25
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,400
even if it meant

26
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:57,040
selling ancestral property
to cover the costs.

27
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,200
But it turns out,

28
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,879
your shabby estate is worth
only so little.

29
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,280
Now, this property
belongs to the Sun family.

30
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,879
This is my residence now.
Let's see who dares to stop me.

31
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,719
Let's see who dares to enter.

32
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,840
You know very well the consequences

33
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,439
of trespassing into private property.

34
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,360
I'll call the magistrate right now

35
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,080
to turn my own residence
upside down if I have to.

36
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,240
It's over.

37
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,120
This is utter chaos!

38
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,240
I'm going to lose my position.

39
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,560
Corpses everywhere!
And you still deny your guilt?

40
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:36,159
They were criminals
who killed and robbed.

41
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,100
I committed no crime!

42
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,019
They died
because of your malicious schemes,

43
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,599
carried out using your followers.

44
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,300
Sun Hua's descent from killing dogs
to killing humans was also

45
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,590
due to your manipulative tactics.

46
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,479
You had them twist the facts

47
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,520
and implant fabricated visions

48
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,599
into Sun Hua's memory.

49
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,960
Is that lantern flickering?

50
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:55,500
It's been steady the whole time.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,360
You drugged him,

52
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,960
leaving him in a dazed state,

53
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,739
sending him into a spiral of self-doubt.

54
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,319
Night falls over the blossoms
north of the city.

55
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,159
His behavior grew increasingly erratic.

56
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,850
He ultimately mistook himself
for the one

57
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:21,240
who committed those absurd murders.

58
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,280
You moved the corpses and weapons

59
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,680
to forge evidence

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,879
and framed Sun Hua,

61
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,340
leaving him unable to defend himself.

62
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,000
If it weren't for these kind souls
stepping in to save me,

63
00:03:33,575 --> 00:03:36,000
I too would've been
wrongfully buried today.

64
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,560
I was truly blind

65
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,560
to have sought your help
to cure my wife's chronic illness.

66
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,520
Why did you target me?

67
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:46,439
They were merely voluntary sacrifices,
ordinary offerings.

68
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,599
But you!

69
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,560
You were a rare sacrificial vessel,
born on a Yin year, month, day!

70
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,639
Only by collecting five skulls
like yours

71
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,680
to craft a ritual tool

72
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,639
can I truly ascend and become immortal.

73
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,599
So, every Yin year and Yin month,

74
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,120
you devise ways

75
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,800
to frame them for murder.

76
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,000
After they are executed,

77
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,719
you collect their remains

78
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,360
and conceal all evidence

79
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,080
for your own purposes.

80
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,199
Mortals wish nothing more than

81
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,400
to ascend to immortality.

82
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,560
These are all offerings
for the Heming Deity!

83
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,100
You don't even deserve to be human,

84
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,499
let alone ascend to immortality!

85
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,319
Let's see

86
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,480
who dies first then.

87
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,399
Even now, you refuse to confess.

88
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,360
None of you will kill me!

89
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,560
I am protected by the Heming Deity!

90
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:37,399
I will survive every calamity!

91
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,480
One day, I will kill you all

92
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,480
to offer you as sacrifices

93
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:44,240
to the Heming Deity!

94
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,800
Heming Deity...

95
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,540
(Badge)

96
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,920
This map shows the locations

97
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,560
where the strange cases occurred.

98
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,419
The place
where Zhiting was kidnapped as a child

99
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,800
is also among them.

100
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,160
The true number of victims

101
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,079
is far greater
than the outside world knows.

102
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,399
Tenfold,

103
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,539
or even a hundredfold.

104
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,360
Song,

105
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,959
we will help you

106
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,399
find the real culprit.

107
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:17,759
Now, the true criminal

108
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,959
remains untouchable,

109
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,639
roaming free.

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,519
Once, a young girl witness

111
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,000
was killed

112
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,839
right at the gates of my office,

113
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,920
and the lotus flower branding
on her body was destroyed.

114
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,839
I had hoped to get some clues from you,

115
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,759
but now I fear

116
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,360
you'll get further entangled in danger.

117
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:41,879
Recalling that time,

118
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,120
I might've been abandoned midway
because I had a rash.

119
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:46,319
In the end,

120
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:47,660
I crawled out of a slop cart

121
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,680
after three days and nights.

122
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,600
How outrageous!

123
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,959
We cannot allow
more children to die so tragically.

124
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,879
Our next stop

125
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,920
is Guichi County.

126
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,319
The magistrate of Guichi County

127
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,600
is an old classmate of mine
from when I studied

128
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,720
under Mr. Xishan.

129
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,399
We'll go to him for clues.

130
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,600
Wherever you go, I'll go.

131
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,639
Together, every day is a good day.

132
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,340
(Anyang County, Xingrong County,
Linchuan County, Guichi County)

133
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,120
Please come in.

134
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,839
Why won't you take our money?

135
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,240
Inquisitor Song,
your bill has already been settled.

136
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,759
You know me?

137
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,560
Magistrate Wu told us.

138
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,700
He asked me to tell you

139
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,639
that he used his personal savings
to pay for you.

140
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,199
Oh,

141
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,059
and Magistrate Wu
also painted your portrait.

142
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,279
Take a look.

143
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,160
That Wu Lao'er...

144
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,800
This painting

145
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,360
is a bit lacking.

146
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,040
A bit lacking.

147
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,720
May I have it for my collection, then?

148
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,480
Not for now.

149
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,319
I have other plans for it.

150
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,519
Let's go.

151
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,120
This way, please.

152
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,098
Did you find the body right when

153
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:57,239
you arrived at the riverbank?

154
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,920
Song Mutou.

155
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,040
Wu Lao'er, it's been years.

156
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,160
What happened?

157
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,519
Someone found the body
of a drowned woman.

158
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,079
I just examined it.

159
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,839
You're still the same.

160
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,499
Always handling things personally.

161
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,140
I just finished questioning everyone.

162
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,160
The woman doesn't seem to be a local.

163
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,359
(Wu Daquan, Magistrate)
It's going to be a difficult case.

164
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:18,319
Let's not dwell on it.

165
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,600
Remember back when

166
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,759
we were both studying under Mr. Xishan?

167
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,560
Among all our classmates,
you were the most diligent.

168
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,639
But during every major exam,

169
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,079
your ranking

170
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,519
was always ahead of mine.

171
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,500
Yet now,

172
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,838
while I'm still just a magistrate,

173
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,480
you've already become an inquisitor.

174
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,320
But soon,

175
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,559
I'll be resigning from office.

176
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,840
What?

177
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,139
Never mind that for now.

178
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,799
Let me introduce you
to my young friends.

179
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,559
He Wenning.

180
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,559
Wang Ling.

181
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,480
Zhao Zhiting.

182
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:55,559
This is an old friend and classmate
of mine from years ago.

183
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,519
If any of you need anything,

184
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,679
just say the word.

185
00:08:58,779 --> 00:08:59,940
I have one request right now.

186
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,159
Could you take us

187

to examine the body?

188
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,100
The stomach isn't swollen.

189
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,679
No water is seeping
from the mouth, eyes,

190

ears, or nose.

by blunt force trauma.

00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,320

She was murdered

197
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,540
and then pushed into the water.

198
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,679
This is peculiar indeed.
