=Episode 10=

3
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,171
Li Shaoren switched out
the murder weapon.

4
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:54,811
If the scandal was exposed,

5
00:00:55,101 --> 00:00:56,330
he must die

6
00:00:56,781 --> 00:00:58,171
for your sake.

7
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:02,131
Correct.

8
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,530
I pretended to fall in love
with Li Shaoren

9
00:01:04,741 --> 00:01:06,530
so I could make him do my bidding.

10
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,250
I never actually loved him.

11
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,410
It was only wishful thinking

12
00:01:12,861 --> 00:01:14,571
of this lovesick fool.

13
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,410
I don't believe

14
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:19,651
that you've never loved me.

15
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:21,291
Would it matter

16
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:23,571
if I had?

17
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,451
From now on,

18
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:27,371
you and I are strangers.

19
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:29,250
You...

20
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,851
You'd better behave from now on.

21
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:34,690
An attempt to murder another
is punishable.

22
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:35,779
Lock her up.

23
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,571
She will be executed in three days.

24
00:01:38,661 --> 00:01:39,979
Cursed officer!

25
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,860
I was going to take my life
after taking yours!

26
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:43,970
I'll never stop haunting you!

27
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,011
Stop!

28
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,811
Their case was solved,

29
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,250
but what about yours?

30
00:01:49,461 --> 00:01:51,091
Magistrate Zhang Youde?

31
00:01:51,221 --> 00:01:52,410
Watch your mouth!

32
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:53,970
Back then,

33
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,979
you allowed Baron Li
to tarnish people's honor

34
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,539
and commit corruption.

35
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,851
He drove Huang Santai insane
and to death.

36
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:01,731
You should be punished as well!

37
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,250
Insolence.

38
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,300
Insolence!

39
00:02:04,301 --> 00:02:05,451
Halt!

40
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:09,259
We received an order from the Prefect.

41
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,299
Zhang Youde forced women
into prostitution.

42
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,171
He is involved in dozens of cases.

43
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:17,610
(County Official Chen)
He is to be impeached and detained.

44
00:02:17,661 --> 00:02:19,131
Nonsense!

45
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:21,090
I've done no such thing!

46
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,180
The ledger records
every transaction of wealth

47
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:28,251
Baron Li used to bribe you.

48
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:30,571
It's evidence of your corruption

49
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,731
and attempt to twist the truth.

50
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,571
Had you not committed
these heinous crimes,

51
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:36,699
he wouldn't have risked her life

52
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,171
or lost her family.

53
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,610
The real murderer

54
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:41,890
is you!

55
00:02:57,661 --> 00:02:58,610
Tang Wan.

56
00:02:58,821 --> 00:03:00,571
You shall be sentenced to death.

57
00:03:00,661 --> 00:03:01,620
The case is closed.

58
00:03:01,621 --> 00:03:03,610
You may go now.

59
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:09,251
I can walk on my own.

60
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,851
Did you mean

61
00:03:15,501 --> 00:03:17,610
every word you said?

62
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:21,571
Live on.

63
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,451
Forget about me.

64
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,971
Shaoren!

65
00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:40,691
Shaoren!

66
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,011
No.

67
00:03:44,661 --> 00:03:46,131
See you on the other side.

68
00:03:48,181 --> 00:03:49,691
Have no fear

69
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,090
for the journey ahead.

70
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,810
Sorry.

71
00:03:58,181 --> 00:03:59,851
The sunshine

72
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:03,090
is warm today.

73
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,090
It's just like...

74
00:04:12,181 --> 00:04:13,610
when we first met.

75
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:26,891
Shaoren!

76
00:04:35,821 --> 00:04:37,570
Perhaps in the end,

77
00:04:37,941 --> 00:04:39,370
she was exhausted,

78
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,690
but too deep in love.

79
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:43,500
Which was why

80
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:45,930
she chose to tell him the easier lie.

81
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,610
They were deeply in love
with each other.

82
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:51,930
Why must they both die in the end?

83
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,370
The outcome maybe regrettable,

84
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,891
but the bond they shared

85
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:58,250
will always be true.

86
00:04:58,501 --> 00:04:59,930
Had she known better,

87
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,771
she shouldn't have
put the plan in motion.

88
00:05:02,821 --> 00:05:04,291
She wouldn't have lost him.

89
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:06,091
They were determined

90
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,450
to be there for each other.

91
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:08,620
They should

92
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:09,930
fear losses.

93
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,891
Back in the troupe,

94
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,490
unless you're a famous actor,

95
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:23,771
you must do your own makeup.

96
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:26,091
Otherwise, they'd starve you

97
00:05:26,181 --> 00:05:27,490
and even beat you.

98
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:33,610
Now,

99
00:05:33,861 --> 00:05:35,531
you don't need them for shelter.

100
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:38,380
There's no one

101
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:40,570
that can hurt so easily.

102
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:53,810
When you first

103
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,570
put the ornament on me,

104
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,610
I had a moment of joy.

105
00:06:01,421 --> 00:06:03,091
But wearing it all the time

106
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,651
is too heavy for me.

107
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,771
I don't just mean on my head,

108
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,930
but my heart as well.

109
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:14,291
But I owe you the hairpin.

110
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,091
You pawned your family's
jade pendant for this.

111
00:06:18,301 --> 00:06:20,411
Nothing in this world can
ever replace it.

112
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,450
I...

113
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,450
It's too much for me.

114
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,130
Thanks for coming here.

115
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:45,091
Inquisitor Song,

116
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,690
the Prefect mentioned in the letter
that I must remind you

117
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,380
that the case of accidental deaths
of those children

118
00:06:50,381 --> 00:06:51,810
has been closed.

119
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,490
Stop your secret visits
and investigations.

120
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,540
To uncover the truth,

121
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,139
I must operate in secrecy.

122
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,820
I've thought long and hard

123
00:06:59,821 --> 00:07:01,731
about the outcome
of overturning the case.

124
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:04,851
You and Magistrate Zhang
were not accomplices.

125
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,610
I hope

126
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,339
you treat the people
of Xingrong County well.

127
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,690
No good people must die.

128
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,771
What about your life?

129
00:07:14,861 --> 00:07:16,139
My demotion

130
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,010
should serve as a warning to you.

131
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:20,091
I can't bear

132
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,771
to see you become miserable.

133
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:25,690
Upholding righteousness
and avoiding taking a stance

134
00:07:25,981 --> 00:07:28,699
are enough to keep
your conscience clear.

135
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,250
In that case,

136
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,851
it's all the more reason
to uncover the truth.

137
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:36,610
I don't wish to be remember as a coward

138
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,851
who plays both ends against the middle

139
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:41,211
to save his own neck.

140
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,250
Very well.

141
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,810
Inquisitor Song.

142
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:52,610
Take care.

143
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,130
Take care.

144
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,130
Greetings, Inquisitor Song.

145
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,331
Inquisitor Song?

146
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,980
Are you really the legendary
Inquisitor Song

147
00:08:07,981 --> 00:08:10,740
Ting has been so obsessed with?

148
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,411
You may call me "sir".

149
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,651
Sir...

150
00:08:13,981 --> 00:08:15,250
Song?

151
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,851
Song?

152
00:08:16,981 --> 00:08:18,291
That will do it.

153
00:08:18,421 --> 00:08:20,130
That's what you call me from now on.

154
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,180
You knew all along?

155
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:24,690
You kept me in the dark!

156
00:08:25,181 --> 00:08:26,940
When I ran into you,

157
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:28,531
we were in danger.

158
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:31,411
I had no choice but to fake an amnesia

159
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,859
to hide my identity.

160
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,979
I hope you won't mind.

161
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,131
Not at all.

162
00:08:36,661 --> 00:08:38,371
Inquisitor Song...

163
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:42,020
The man I know better
than my own parents?

164
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,499
The man Zhao Zhiting adores
more than anyone in the world?

165
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,411
I can't believe we've run into him!

166
00:08:46,421 --> 00:08:47,260
So,

167
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:49,411
where are we headed for next,
inquisitor Song?

168
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,450
We'll travel together
as an unbreakable team.

169
00:08:53,661 --> 00:08:54,900
Do you think

170
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,300
your debt to him is cleared?

171
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:58,011
I am broke.

172
00:08:58,061 --> 00:08:58,780
Really?

173
00:08:58,781 --> 00:08:59,970
Zhao has the money.

174
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,251
Take this.

175
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,420
You pawned this off

176
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:09,891
to buy her a hairpin.

177
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,090
It belonged to your family.

178
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,540
I bought it back for you.

179
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,930
Now, I am returning it.

180
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,850
Thank you, Inquisitor Song.

181
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,131
You secretly guided us

182
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,411
so we could find

183
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,531
the critical clues of those cases.

184
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,730
Acting is the only craft
actors like us have.

185
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,979
However, I know

186
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,570
you pretended

187
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,930
to be a senile old man
because you had your reasons.

188
00:09:34,301 --> 00:09:36,140
When we first met,

189
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:38,020
it didn't took you long to notice

190
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:39,651
the lotus-shape scar on my chest.

191
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,739
Does it have something
to do with the scar?

192
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,970
When you got that scar,

193
00:09:44,061 --> 00:09:45,450
you were but a child.

194
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,611
Perhaps you barely remember a thing.

195
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,859
It's a perilous mystery.
It's best you stay out of it.

196
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,690
Do not get involved with them.

197
00:09:53,421 --> 00:09:55,210
When I was abducted and transported,

198
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,540
I was blindfolded.

199
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,930
But, it felt like a bustling place.

200
00:10:00,021 --> 00:10:01,491
I could hear the noises

201
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,531
of a busy street.

202
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,131
Does it remind you of Lin'an?

203
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,611
I think so.

204
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,491
And then, I joined the troupe.

205
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:11,651
They were in Lin'an.

206
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:13,651
Were there similar cases in Lin'an?

207
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,300
Yes.

208
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:16,420
Inquisitor Song,

209
00:10:16,421 --> 00:10:17,810
Do you have a lead?

210
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,979
After a long investigation,

211
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,491
I haven't found any concrete evidence.

212
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,450
- We'll search for the answer.
- Eat up.

213
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,611
However,

214
00:10:25,661 --> 00:10:27,570
I have other questions for you.

215
00:10:27,941 --> 00:10:28,970
Shoot.

216
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,090
Could you tell me

217
00:10:30,261 --> 00:10:31,680
which of them are real

218
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,640
(Records of Song Ci, Tales of Song Ci)
and which are fake?

219
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,171
The line between truth
and fiction is blurred.

220
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,210
However, you just inspired me

221
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:41,660
to record the truth myself.

222
00:10:41,661 --> 00:10:43,739
Perhaps it could come in handy

223
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,339
for future investigators.

224
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,970
It will do more than that.

225
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,090
Some inspirations last a lifetime.

226
00:10:53,021 --> 00:10:55,411
Come on, that's too mushy.

227
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,611
You are making Inquisitor Song barf.

228
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,900
Forget it.

229
00:10:58,901 --> 00:10:59,940
He can never be normal.

230
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:02,411
I got used to it.

231
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,820
Why is the street

232
00:11:07,821 --> 00:11:09,210
empty?

233
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,171
Where is the dog's corpse?

234
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,730
The dog's corpse is missing.

235
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,371
Where is the dog's corpse?

236
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:25,011
Where is the dog's corpse?

237
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,531
Where is the dog's corpse?

238
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,930
Did you see a dog's corpse?

239
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,611
Where is the dog's corpse?

240
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:34,531
Where is the dog's corpse?

241
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,891
