2
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,340
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,820
Dear!

4
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,590
Is that my husband?

5
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,390
Is it you, my husband?

6
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,269
Why is it you?

7
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,780
Where is my husband?

8
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,460
I have only one question.

9
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,269
You said the poem

10
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,499
was written by Wu Daquan to Sun.

11
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,989
How do you know?

12
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,030
So what if I read his letters in secret?

13
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,030
Did you know

14
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,070
Sun was illiterate?

15
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,310
What?

16
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,590
She couldn't read?

17
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,430
Then why did he write

18
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,340
those letters?

19
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,749
Magistrate Wu wrote those letters

20
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,629
for Huang Jirou to read.

21
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,699
No wonder we found that servant.

22
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,620
It was all part of Wu Daquan's plan.

23
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,339
Even the letter left at my door

24
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,540
when I first arrived

25
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,230
was likely written by him.

26
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,820
It's time to settle this.

27
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,540
You're burning your wife's belongings.

28
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,229
Burning them

29
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,419
to sever all ties.

30
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,549
Song Mutou,

31
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,260
why are you here again?

32
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,229
My companions

33
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,459
have a story

34
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,140
they'd like to share with you.

35
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,739
A man married the daughter
of a court official

36
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,750
to advance his career.

37
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,179
But he didn't care for her

38
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,619
as much as she did for him.

39
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,509
He felt trapped.

40
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,470
Then, his old lover returned
to the county to find him.

41
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,229
What is this?

42
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,540
Inquisitor Song,

43
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,349
are you writing plays with them now?

44
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,950
The letter you wrote

45
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,139
looked like it was for Sun,

46
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,630
but Sun couldn't even read.

47
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,350
What was your real intent

48
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,510
with that letter?

49
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,350
I feel sorry for your wife.

50
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,389
To be manipulated to her death

51
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,980
by the man she loved.

52
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,470
Such cruelty.

53
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,860
You killed her heart before her body.

54
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,790
You even destroyed her belongings

55
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,260
before her passing.

56
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,910
When you knew I was coming,

57
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,579
you provoked your wife

58
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,989
to kill Sun,

59
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,790
then tried to shift the blame.

60
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,630
Your true intent

61
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,420
was to get rid of your wife.

62
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,829
Your little play

63
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,509
needs another act

64
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,019
to make it more interesting.

65
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,739
The old lover,

66
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,419
seeing the man
she once knew had changed,

67
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,699
wanted to rekindle
their past relationship.

68
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,949
This enraged him.

69
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,459
Initially, he planned to have
someone else do the killing.

70
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,549
Then, he decided
to kill two birds with one stone.

71
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,699
Do you admit to it?

72
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,899
Admit?

73
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,109
With no evidence,

74
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,630
what crime am I confessing to?

75
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,670
When you were penniless,

76
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,389
you bought your wife a trinket
from a street vendor

77
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,230
as a token of love.

78
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,190
But she treasured it as if it were
the most precious thing in the world.

79
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,019
No matter what wrongs you committed,

80
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,509
she accepted them

81
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,470
and wanted to stay by your side.

82
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,989
This letter

83
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:15,190
(To My Dearest Husband)
was her final chance for you.

84
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,349
And you destroyed it
with your own hands.

85
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,589
A letter?

86
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,819
What about it?

87
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,909
Can a few words

88
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:21,989
convict me?

89
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,179
(To My Dearest Husband)

90
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,029
If I send this letter

91
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,630
to your father-in-law, Huang Weijun,

92
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,819
what do you think

93
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,340
he'll do?

94
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,310
With the laws of Song,

95
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,424
what can he do to me?

96
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:35,469
(To My Dearest Husband)

97
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,750
If the world learns
of your malicious schemes,

98
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,340
who will let you be an official?

99
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,419
Song Mutou,
I've never begged you for anything.

100
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,140
I'm begging you this once.

101
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,700
Just this once.

102
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,739
Can't you burn that letter?

103
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,070
Please?

104
00:05:02,283 --> 00:05:03,499
Song Ci!

105
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,700
Must you destroy me?

106
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,140
Song Ci!

107
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,990
You used this trick

108
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,260
on me twice.

109
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,499
The first time,

110
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,469
I played along intentionally,

111
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,900
luring you into capturing Qi.

112
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,430
The second time,

113
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,580
I let my arrogance triumph me.

114
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,900
From the very beginning,

115
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,619
that woman controlled, used,

116
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,619
and threatened me

117
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,419
with marriage, my career,

118
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,149
and my path as an official.

119
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,700
She deserved to die!

120
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,580
She gave up everything for you.

121
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,310
Yet, you call it control
and exploitation instead of love?

122
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,140
You are the one who deserves to die.

123
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,059
Isn't he a good man?

124
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,140
- It's Inquisitor Song.
- Yes.

125
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,499
I've heard good things about him.

126
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,379
I have too.

127
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,080
(Wanted: Corrupt official Song Ci.)

128
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,819
To end up like this in these times…

129
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,310
Indeed.

130
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,939
This…

131
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,589
Who is he to Inquisitor Song?

132
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,950
I don't know.

133
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,750
Song!

134
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,550
These are my friends.

135
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,780
Could you grant us a moment?

136
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,700
He.

137
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,780
Give it to me.

138
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,310
Song.

139
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,310
Why are they arresting you?

140
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,020
They're afraid I'll cause more trouble.

141
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,430
So they've trumped up some false charge

142
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,750
just to lock me away.

143
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,430
I have one last request.

144
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,029
But it will be perilous.

145
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,700
We fear no danger.

146
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,110
We promised you we'd help investigate

147
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,550
the case of the abandoned bodies.

148
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,430
Now

149
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,140
that you've been pushed
into such a situation,

150
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,390
please entrust it to us.

151
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,310
We'll find the truth
and get you out of here.

152
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,469
Song.

153
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,109
Every meal I've eaten under your roof

154
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,419
was not for nothing.

155
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,709
If there's danger,

156
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,950
I'll be the first to charge forward.

157
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,070
Song.

158
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,780
We can be your eyes, ears, and hands.

159
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,190
We can be your voice too.

160
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,820
We'll speak truths of the dead souls

161
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,070
who never had a chance to be heard.

162
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,750
We'll speak of the injustice

163
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,190
Inquisitor Song couldn't openly declare.

164
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,110
And when the truth comes to light,

165
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,870
that will be the day we reunite.

166
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,630
All right.

167
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,230
This is all the evidence

168
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,230
I've gathered so far.

169
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,780
Take it.

170
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,390
I shall be

171
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,510
