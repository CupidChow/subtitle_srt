2
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,940
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,729
Ever since I came here,

4
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:49,928
my nightmares

5
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:52,400
have only gotten worse day by day.

6
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,879
My head feels like it's going to split!

7
00:00:58,730 --> 00:00:59,760
Everyone.

8
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,080
Thank you for your hard work.

9
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,660
Now that my father has passed away,

10
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,280
there's no longer any need
to exorcise the ghost in the mansion.

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,288
If you wish to stay,

12
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:09,919
you can stay here for a few more days.

13
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:11,919
But if you wish to leave,

14
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:13,999
it's best to do so at dawn.

15
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,999
I want to wait for
my benefactor, Er to return.

16
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,329
Could we stay

17
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,400
until this case is resolved?

18
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,200
I'll cover the expenses

19
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:26,919
for these past few days in full.

20
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,559
It's already been three mealtimes passed
since Wang Ling was taken.

21
00:01:37,809 --> 00:01:39,120
I don't even know

22
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:41,079
if he's gone hungry.

23
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:43,680
Haven't you also gone
without a single sip of water?

24
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:47,600
Do you think flipping through this pile
of books can save Wang Ling?

25
00:01:47,809 --> 00:01:48,999
I can't,

26
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,519
but Inquisitor Song can.

27
00:01:51,809 --> 00:01:54,439
Whether Baron Li's room
or the side chambers of the Li Mansion,

28
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,880
there's no murder weapon
or evidence found.

29
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,079
But only a headless corpse.

30
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:01,799
The answer can only be found there.

31
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,249
Inquisitor Song once said,
where there's a murderer, there's a lie.

32
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,129
(Story of Song Ci)
The corpses never lie.

33
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,920
How do you make a corpse speak?

34
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,400
I'll follow the methods stated here
to conduct a postmortem

35
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,680
and clear Wang Ling's reputation.

36
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,639
But these are all just stories.

37
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:17,239
Can these stories save someone?

38
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,280
Do you want to use this
for a postmortem?

39
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,089
You've been obsessing
over Song Ci along the journey.

40
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,168
I think you're more
of a "Song-obsessed fool"!

41
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:25,560
What a big obsessed fool!

42
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,119
When I was framed in the past,

43
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:32,639
Wang Ling was the only one
who stood by my side.

44
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:33,919
Now,

45
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,799
he's been wrongly accused
and taken away.

46
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:37,239
I'm the only one

47
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:39,959
who can save him now.

48
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,448
What do you mean by that?

49
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:45,079
Aren't the rest of us here for you?

50
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:47,280
You're not alone in this.

51
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,040
It's dangerous for you to come with me.

52
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:01,040
I want to save my benefactor.

53
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:04,008
Enough with the sentimentality.
Let's start searching quickly.

54
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:06,160
I wasn't being sentimental.

55
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:09,679
Baron Li's

56
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,369
neck wound

57
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,799
is jagged,

58
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,560
not smooth or curled.

59
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:18,448
It seems like

60
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:20,399
he was cut little by little
with a dull knife.

61
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,119
True!

62
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:26,320
Oh no.

63
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,799
Someone's coming from afar!

64
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:38,119
Someone dies, someone alive.

65
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,639
A wrongful death yearns for rebirth.

66
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:45,320
I'm a kind man.

67
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,880
I'm not afraid of ghosts.

68
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,048
The blood of a kind man

69
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:52,209
is sweeter.

70
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,000
Ghost! Ghost!

71
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:02,488
Impressive!

72
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:04,089
Stop watching. Run!

73
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,608
They'll find out soon.

74
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:06,809
You go find clues.

75
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:07,959
I'll go find Wang Ling.

76
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:09,519
Alright.

77
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,799
Let's go.

78
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,529
Hey, buddy.

79
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,519
If you're not eating that,

80
00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:22,039
can I have it?

81
00:04:22,489 --> 00:04:23,800
This is death row.

82
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,400
Everyone here is waiting
to be executed after the autumn season.

83
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,760
And yet you still have an appetite?

84
00:04:27,929 --> 00:04:29,048
So, that means

85
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:31,399
you're not eating, right?

86
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,159
Here you go.

87
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,959
Thanks, thanks.

88
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,889
I've got a good buddy

89
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,128
named Zhao Zhiting.

90
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:40,248
Behind his ear,

91
00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:41,608
there's a bat-shaped birthmark.

92
00:04:41,609 --> 00:04:43,800
He might hear what we're saying.

93
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,009
Your buddy's name

94
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,529
and what ability he owns

95
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,000
have nothing to do with me.

96
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,519
Zhao Zhiting said

97
00:04:49,609 --> 00:04:51,240
he'd come and save me again.

98
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,329
How dare you go to the mortuary

99
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,569
to scare the officers!

100
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,160
- I went there to investigate the case.
- Investigate the case?

101
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,128
This county has 17 or 18 runners.
Why does it fall to you to investigate?

102
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:03,719
- Tell me, where are your accomplices?
- I have no accomplices.

103
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:06,320
But I did see a ghost.

104
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,760
A female ghost.

105
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,808
Stop eating. A newcomer's here.

106
00:05:11,809 --> 00:05:12,959
Get in!

107
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,599
Hey you, what's your name?

108
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,000
Zhao Zhiting?

109
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,800
Zhao Zhiting?

110
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,839
Why does this name sound familiar?

111
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:26,200
Oh no.

112
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,719
It's all over.

113
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,889
Even if I'm full,
I will be trapped here.

114
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,120
I'll just end up as gluttonous ghost.

115
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:36,599
You're the friend he mentioned about?

116
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,399
You're here too.

117
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,608
We survived bandits on our journey,

118
00:05:40,609 --> 00:05:42,248
and the wild animals didn't hunt us.

119
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:44,440
Yet now a headless ghost has taken us.

120
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:45,608
It's all your fault.

121
00:05:45,609 --> 00:05:48,639
Why did you have to mimic Song Ci
and investigate a dumb case?

122
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,760
Now it's up to

123
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,009
Miss He and the old man.

124
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,800
Our clever guy is down.

125
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,440
Miss He and the old man

126
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,279
will be here to save us!

127
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,719
Here you go again.

128
00:05:59,929 --> 00:06:02,680
Will they end up in here too?

129
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,639
Tell me,

130
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,279
what were you doing in that room

131
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,240
the night of the incident?

132
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,849
I was there following the smell.

133
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,449
I caught a whiff of alkali,

134
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,040
and thought there might be buns to grab.

135
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,840
- But there weren't any buns.
- A whiff of alkali?

136
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,120
But, there was other food there.

137
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,159
Look at you, chubby and well-fed.

138
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:22,680
When the executioner swings his knife,

139
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:24,680
the blood from your neck

140
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:26,248
will gush everywhere.

141
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:27,719
Stop saying that.

142
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,440
Otherwise, I won't
be able to eat anymore.

143
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:31,639
Exactly.

144
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,800
It should have spouted
all over the ground.

145
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,209
Wang Ling,

146
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,329
what you smelled that night

147
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,959
wasn't the alkali used for making buns.

148
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:40,360
It was the alkali water
used to clean the blood stains.

149
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,599
When you saw Baron Li,

150
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,048
he was

151
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:45,599
already dead.

152
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:47,519
Yes, yes.

153
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,279
You're right.

154
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:50,399
Good!

155
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:51,880
You're saved now.

156
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,519
Let's go.

157
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:57,000
Guards! The Song inspector
for criminal justice is here!

158
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,220
(Inspector for Criminal Justice)
Here's a token as proof.

159
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:02,159
What were you doing
the day of the incident?

160
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:05,039
Baron Li cherishes life the most.

161
00:07:05,369 --> 00:07:07,808
That night, I saw him from afar

162
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:10,200
practicing the
longevity exercises, Baduanjin.

163
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,760
I never expected

164
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,000
it'd be the last time I see him.

165
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:18,089
What about the day before the incident?

166
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,128
I spent the entire day

167
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:20,889
doing laundry.

168
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,279
Everyone in the servants' room saw me.

169
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,728
What happened to Baron Li?

170
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:26,889
Baron Li was stingy.

171
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,089
He offended many people,

172
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,120
and wasn't close
to his wife and children.

173
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,449
In his entire life,

174
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,839
he only loved money.

175
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:34,880
It must be

176
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,400
Baron Li killed Huang Santai,

177
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,800
and now the vengeful ghost
has come to take his life away.

178
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:41,240
I...

179
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:43,209
I've seen the ghost several times.

180
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,009
Anyway,

181
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,079
I couldn't bear to stay here anymore.

182
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:48,039
I haven't done asking you.

183
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,959
Magistrate Zhang, is that true?

184
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:56,128
Before this, when the
inspector of criminal justice patrolled

185
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:58,959
or sent someone to investigate,
they always carried this token.

186
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:01,039
It shouldn't be fake.

187
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,839
Could it be a stolen one?

188
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,808
I heard that Inquisitor Song is conducting
private investigations in various places.

189
00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:07,849
Not long ago,

190
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,240
he even convicted a county magistrate
and sent him to prison.

191
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:12,560
By the way,

192
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:14,288
the bag of the guy named Zhao Zhiting

193
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:16,279
is filled with things about Song Ci.

194
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:17,760
Don't you think

195
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,240
he might have been trying
to give us a hint all along?

196
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,588
I also heard from the prison guard

197
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:23,870
that Wang Ling is eating
and drinking freely in the prison.

198
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,720
He is completely unbothered by
the his death sentence.

199
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,040
If he didn't have someone backing him,
how could he be so carefree?

200
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,839
Exactly.

201
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,399
A normal person wouldn't read books
about forensic autopsies.

202
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:33,728
Magistrate Zhang is
on the verge of a promotion.

203
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:34,849
At a time like this,

204
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,040
we must be extremely cautious.

205
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,839
You two must have been
suffered in the prison.

206
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:46,008
Any progress

207
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:47,160
on the beheading case?

208
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,929
No rush with the investigation.
Have some tea.

209
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,160
Have some tea?

210
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,640
Is there anything more
urgent than solving the case?

211
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:55,289
If you delay even a moment,

212
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,560
what if someone else falls victim?

213
00:08:58,249 --> 00:08:59,648
What a selfless dedication he has!

214
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:00,608
This level of awareness

215
00:09:00,609 --> 00:09:02,359
is rare among those
ordinary country bumpkins.

216
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,169
What were you all doing
at Baron Li's mansion?

217
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,809
You asked that 1800 times already
when you interrogated me earlier.

218
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,209
We were there to exorcise the ghost.

219
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,599
He talks to the
county official so fearlessly.

220
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,599
He's either a fool
or has someone to rely on.

221
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,599
Baron Li indeed hired
someone to exorcise ghosts,

222
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:21,239
but how could an actor
like you possibly do that?

223
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,008
To earn a living.

224
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:23,849
That's right.

225
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,800
Baron Li has always been well-informed

226
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:27,839
and close to officials.

227
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:30,040
Could it be that Baron Li

228
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:33,680
was using money as a pretense
to secretly entertain Inquisitor Song?

229
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,329
You two troublemakers,

230
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,108
how dare you impersonate
the imperial envoys?

231
00:09:38,108 --> 00:09:39,239
How bold!

232
00:09:39,489 --> 00:09:41,320
Who are you talking to so loudly?

233
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:46,999
You've arrested the wrong people.

234
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:47,929
County official,

235
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,520
why bother making things difficult
for these two young men?

236
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,359
Anyone can see that
they are upright citizens.

237
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,879
If you truly want
to investigate this case thoroughly,

238
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,359
please go ahead.

239
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,608
Magistrate, are we really letting
them go just like that?

240
00:10:06,609 --> 00:10:07,999
Send someone to follow them.

241
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,840
If they are sincere
about investigating the case,

242
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,719
we lose nothing.

243
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:14,920
That's true.

244
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:17,879
We're doing a favor
for Inquisitor Song.

245
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,920
If they are frauds,

246
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:22,640
we'll just arrest them again.

247
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,719
