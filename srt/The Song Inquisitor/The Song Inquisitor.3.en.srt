00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,940
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:16,730
Great work!

4
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,730
Nice singing!

5
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,170
I brought joss papers for you!

6
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,209
Ghosts don't cast shadows
under the moonlight.

7
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,338
Spreading fear and lies

8
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:30,969
is a crime punishable by death in Song!

9
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,810
I dare you to come
and claim your money!

10
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,890
Come up.

11
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,609
Are you hurt?

12
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:46,498
Sir, where did you go?

13
00:01:46,499 --> 00:01:48,049
We were worried about you.

14
00:01:48,059 --> 00:01:48,939
Sir,

15
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,698
did you run into the ghost troupe?

16
00:01:50,699 --> 00:01:52,418
Are you really ghosts?

17
00:01:52,419 --> 00:01:53,459
Nope.

18
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,250
How did you fall?

19
00:01:57,419 --> 00:01:59,209
Were those really ghosts?

20
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,810
Young man, is that injury at your chest

21
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,769
from last night's encounter?

22
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,058
This is a scar

23
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:09,370
I got as a child.

24
00:02:11,779 --> 00:02:13,250
That scar

25
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,969
has quite a unique shape.

26
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,330
What happened back then?

27
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:19,129
I was almost abducted.

28
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,610
I was lucky to have escaped.

29
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,849
It was long ago.

30
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:23,289
I can barely remember.

31
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:27,969
In any case,

32
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,490
you are safe now.

33
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,739
(Cases of Song Ci)

34
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,849
(Tales of Song Ci)
You spent every penny on these.

35
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,419
Song Ci is all the way in Lin'an.

36
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,739
A nobody like you and me

37
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,129
can never hope to meet him in person.

38
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,210
I can tell

39
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,650
you really like Inquisitor Song.

40
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:47,770
Yes.

41
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:49,299
When he is around,

42
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,090
there is justice and hope.

43
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:52,459
Honor and truth

44
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,849
can prevail.

45
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:55,729
Check this out.

46
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:58,810
I recorded news about the curious cases.

47
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,459
I marked the map.

48
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,370
(Cases of Song Ci)
These are places of occurrence.

49
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,650
I want to be like Inquisitor Song

50
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,289
and unveil the truth.

51
00:03:09,619 --> 00:03:11,810
Not again! Would you give it a rest?

52
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,218
You fell into a pit and ran into ghosts.

53
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:15,058
At this rate,

54
00:03:15,059 --> 00:03:16,778
we could both get killed.

55
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,218
There is too much injustice

56
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:19,689
across the world.

57
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,739
Inquisitor clear the names
of the living innocents

58
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,129
and the dead.

59
00:03:24,339 --> 00:03:26,058
He endured countless perils

60
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:27,169
and dark nights.

61
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,009
Our misfortune

62
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:30,658
is nothing compared to his challenges.

63
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:31,849
They are insignificant.

64
00:03:32,339 --> 00:03:33,409
We're not giving up.

65
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,169
My husband!

66
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:51,009
My husband!

67
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,289
Deng Guang gave your husband
some medicine.

68
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,338
Why didn't you inform

69
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:56,658
the authority when they came

70
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:57,969
to investigate his death?

71
00:03:58,059 --> 00:03:59,579
I suspect the medicine

72
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,179
was laced with addictive substances.

73
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,739
The death of your husband is connected
to the funerary opera at the cemetery

74
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,569
and Deng Guang's disappearance.

75
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,058
We suspect your husband

76
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:10,569
was murdered.

77
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,610
We are here to help.

78
00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:13,969
The case is complicated.

79
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,330
Please give us permission

80
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,009
to exhume the body.

81
00:04:17,219 --> 00:04:19,129
You've shed enough tears.

82
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,499
At this point,
it won't bring more grief.

83
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,939
Uncovering the truth

84
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,730
could bring justice
to your deceased husband

85
00:04:25,859 --> 00:04:27,658
and prove his innocence.

86
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:29,769
We'll relocate the grave

87
00:04:30,179 --> 00:04:33,329
and exhume the body
on an auspicious date.

88
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:37,129
My husband!

89
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,490
My husband!

90
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:44,689
The corpse is moving!
Run for your lives!

91
00:04:47,859 --> 00:04:49,529
My husband!

92
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,129
It's Deng Guang!

93
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,470
(The marks stand out upon inspection)

94
00:05:02,859 --> 00:05:04,250
If I were Deng Guang,

95
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,290
spending that much time
with Baron Wang's body

96
00:05:06,299 --> 00:05:07,569
would've traumatized me.

97
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,510
(Cases of Song Ci)

98
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:22,769
I need your silver hairpin.

99
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,499
It's my favorite accessory!

100
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,699
Miss He! Calm down!

101
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,370
- It came in a set!
- Miss He!

102
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:29,810
Calm down.

103
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,418
Calm down.

104
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:45,810
This is gross.

105
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,970
(This was recorded
in one of Song Ci's investigations.)

106
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:50,009
(This is the sign)

107
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,490
(of lethal poisoning.)

108
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,769
Compared to the portrait in his home,

109
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:00,178
Baron Wang looks

110
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:02,490
completely malnourished.

111
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,569
Poor thing.

112
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:06,089
This is

113
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,170
caused by addiction to the medicine.

114
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,810
Curse you, Zhao Zhiting!

115
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:13,738
You owe me a silver hairpin!

116
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:15,089
Curse you!

117
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:17,810
Miss He, calm down.

118
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,850
It was necessary to solve the case.

119
00:06:24,179 --> 00:06:27,098
Events take place
like a shifting game of chess.

120
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:29,899
There is endless sorrow
throughout history.

121
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:35,970
Greed and fame is nothing
but an illusion.

122
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,619
It's beyond sorrow.

123
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,889
Do you know

124
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:42,019
What this is?

125
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,329
Fleeting fame.

126
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,610
We found this in your house.

127
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,858
You killed Baron Wang with the poison.

128
00:06:49,859 --> 00:06:51,499
We asked a dozen times.

129
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,250
We got nothing out of him.

130
00:06:54,739 --> 00:06:56,538
Back in my hometown,

131
00:06:56,539 --> 00:06:58,290
we had a way to treat the mentally ill.

132
00:06:58,419 --> 00:06:59,810
That special treatment

133
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,769
is known as castration.

134
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,290
It's a craft passed down in our family.

135
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,810
We've done it to pigs many times.

136
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:11,649
You're in for a treat.
We're doing it for free and without pain.

137
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,689
He passed out. Even better.
That keeps the pain out.

138
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,459
Do you do it in one cut

139
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,209
or do you have to saw it
until it comes off?

140
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,329
If his knife won't cut it,

141
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,529
there is a guillotine here.

142
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,978
We can get butcher knives
at the marketplace.

143
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:35,449
He needs the treatment now.
We mustn't wait.

144
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,529
Well then,

145
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:39,769
let's begin.

146
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:47,418
My mind just became

147
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:48,610
sharp and clear.

148
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,009
Your treatment worked wonders.

149
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:53,889
How dare you, Deng Guang!

150
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,899
You poisoned and killed Baron Wang.

151
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,939
And now, you dare take me for a fool!

152
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,610
You must face judgment!

153
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:03,619
I've been wronged, sir!

154
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,978
Someone trapped me inside the coffin.

155
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:07,658
I'd never commit murder!

156
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:09,418
What are you? An actor?

157
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:10,298
Quit acting.

158
00:08:10,299 --> 00:08:12,139
You lost all the money to gambling.

159
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,418
Where did you get the money?

160
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:14,579
I found it.

161
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,858
The coroner examined

162
00:08:15,859 --> 00:08:17,490
the medicine found in your house.

163
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:20,139
It's the addictive poison
you sold to Baron Wang.

164
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,410
Stop denying it.

165
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,889
At first,

166
00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:26,778
(Late Mother Zhao De)
I thought the ghost troupe were graverobbers

167
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:28,850
who spread terror
to cover their operation.

168
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:30,529
Just like every other

169
00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:32,490
unsolved mysteries in this county,

170
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,370
you blamed it on the ghost troupe

171
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,009
to get away with it.

172
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,690
Baron Wang.

173
00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:46,938
(Baron Wang)
I found a secret family technique.

174
00:08:46,939 --> 00:08:48,330
I can win big this time.

175
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,259
Please,

176
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,649
let me take another loan.

177
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:55,619
I'll pay you every coin I owe you.
Please, Baron Wang.

178
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,730
You have three days

179
00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:57,818
to clear your debt.

180
00:08:57,819 --> 00:08:59,169
Otherwise, you're dead to me.

181
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:02,379
Baron Wang was wealthy.

182
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,778
But he would have me killed

183
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:05,250
over a small loan!

184
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:06,899
He deserved it.

185
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,610
Aren't you marrying a concubine
to bring in good luck?

186
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,090
Here.

187
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,250
This is my secret divine medicine.

188
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,490
I guarantee

189
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:19,169
you can get a son soon.

190
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:19,938
Really?

191
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:20,970
Yeah.

192
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,938
Let me try it out.

193
00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:22,889
Go ahead.

194
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,538
Stop banging on the door!

195
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:27,379
Open up!

196
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,490
I'll head
to the gambling parlor tomorrow!

197
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,450
What do you want?

198
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,058
Stay still!

199
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:34,009
Stop moving!

200
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,769
The world is full of weird people,

201
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:37,418
(Mu Qing)
but none would be as eager

202
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:38,458
to watch a funerary opera

203
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:39,818
Come clean. What did you see?

204
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:40,769
Start talking!

205
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,778
Start talking!

206
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:42,739
Nothing!

207
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,538
Start talking, or I'll tear you apart!

208
00:09:44,539 --> 00:09:45,690
Start talking!

209
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,889
Grave goods?

210
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:52,129
Are you graverobbers too?

211
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,090
Only silence can keep you alive.

212
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,330
There's more after the job is done.

213
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,169
That was when I found out

214
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,690
the ghosts were just people.

215
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:04,979
I promise to pull off a play for them.

216
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,450
The funerary opera is not
meant for the living.

217
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,370
It was meant to stop people

218
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,739
from investigating.

219
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,809
But those people poured oil on my house.

220
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,219
Those cursed thieves

221
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,210
never wanted to let me live.

222
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,219
So, I set my house ablaze

223
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,610
and ran during the fire.

224
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,139
You're a smart one,

225
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,458
but also too stubborn.

226
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:30,370
Get lost.

227
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,610
I promised I wouldn't kill you.

228
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,409
But I never said I'd let you live.

229
00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:39,139
I thought

230
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,570
I was doomed for sure.

231
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:43,450
But you relocated the coffin
and saved me.

232
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:45,370
I'm telling you the truth.

233
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,178
I am a victim too.

234
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,178
You're the victim?

235
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:50,970
Do you know no shame at all?

236
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,970
When we saw the ghost troupe,

237
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,730
we alerted them.

238
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,778
Do you know where they are now?

239
00:10:57,779 --> 00:10:59,490
The woman carries a unique

240
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:01,769
scent of black locust.

241
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,809
It's no ordinary black locust.

242
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:14,250
This is it. It's the same scent.

243
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:18,769
What do you want?

244
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,970
What do you want?

245
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:21,339
- Stay still!
- Let go of me!

246
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,409
Let go of me!

247
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:28,499
No one moves.

248
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,649
Not one step closer.

249
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:30,619
Miss He, what now?

250
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,339
I'll kill the boy!

251
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,529
Stay away!

252
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,289
Is that all you can do?

253
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,490
Do you know who your hostage is?

254
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:38,979
He is an actor.

255
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,129
They are a dime a dozen.

256
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,058
You are bluffing.

257
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:46,649
I don't care much about his life.

258
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,739
But you?

259
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,929
Killing you would doom yourself.

260
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:52,570
Risking your life over a stranger?

261
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,889
Is it worth it?

262
00:11:54,819 --> 00:11:57,178
I can get away after I lure them here.

263
00:11:57,179 --> 00:11:58,250
Is the deal

264
00:11:58,579 --> 00:11:59,809
still on the table?

265
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,049
I thought San came back.

266
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,649
Why is it so quiet out here?

267
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:05,049
Indeed.

268
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,658
Tell him to guard the items.

269
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,049
We'll depart tomorrow.

270
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,139
Mu Qing, run!

271
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,330
