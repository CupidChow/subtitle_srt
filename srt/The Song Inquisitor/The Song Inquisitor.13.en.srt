=Episode 13=

3
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:47,999
Yang Hewen's carriage

4
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:50,079
was seen in front
of the county administrative office.

5
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,000
Maybe his men

6
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,500
was listening to the trial

7
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,800
and then went back
to inform them to move the corpses.

8
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,920
Magistrate Wang.

9
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,600
This person is a serious suspect

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,700
and should be arrested
and interrogated quickly.

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,000
You're right.

12
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:04,079
We must catch the murderer.

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,200
This is only suspicion without proof.

14
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,920
He's a highly respected local gentry.

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,319
I can't arrest him without reason.

16
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:12,719
Didn't we tell you

17
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,799
that there was not only
a lot of blood there

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,640
but also a bloodstained women's clothes.

19
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,120
You're right.

20
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,640
The bloodstained clothes
don't look good in the yard.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,359
But Yang Hewen's explanation

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,519
makes sense too.

23
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:26,439
A piece of clothing
can't prove someone was killed.

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,159
How does it make sense?

25
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,760
What if a woman is missing

26
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,079
and was murdered?

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,680
Why are you making up a story?

28
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,760
Magistrate Wang.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,159
You have

30
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,239
such an easy job.

31
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,799
I'm working on a case,
not watching a performance.

32
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,760
Unfounded speculation
can't be taken seriously.

33
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,040
Inquisitor Song.

34
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,359
Don't you think so?

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,480
Let's find Sun Hua's wife again.

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,439
I can't let

37
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,120
those helpless girls die

38
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,640
for no reason.

39
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,200
Today, it's her.

40
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,000
Tomorrow, it's me.

41
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,699
The day after tomorrow

42
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,159
could be countless bleak lives.

43
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:13,800
Think about it again.

44
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,159
Is there anything unusual

45
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,599
about your husband before the incident?

46
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,000
Don't miss a single detail.

47
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,280
I told you what I saw.

48
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,039
All that's left are what I didn't see

49
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,479
and my speculation.

50
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,680
Please tell me about it.

51
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,919
Several times after my husband returned,
he asked the servants

52
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,520
about the lanterns at the gate.

53
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,520
Is the lantern flickering?

54
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,840
It's always lit.

55
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,719
It's always lit?

56
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,159
Master.

57
00:02:58,339 --> 00:02:59,380
The lantern is broken.

58
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,520
It keeps flickering.

59
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,859
Find someone to fix it.

60
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:02,919
Master.

61
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,360
It's always lit.

62
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,000
Have you been working too hard lately?

63
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,479
It's always lit?

64
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,960
It's always lit?

65
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,599
It's always lit?

66
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,879
Sir, your noodles.

67
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,639
Sir, I come here everyday.

68
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,500
Why does your table
change position every day?

69
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,759
You're my regular customer.

70
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,299
My shop has always been this way.

71
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,039
Strange.

72
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,240
This is the purse
you left here yesterday.

73
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,520
Put it away.

74
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:36,639
He kept muttering
that something strange was going on.

75
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,439
After encountering that incident,
he came home and realized

76
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,120
that his purse was gone.

77
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,520
Good.

78
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,919
Good.

79
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,439
Murder.

80
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,199
Can't you see there's murder?

81
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,039
Murder?

82
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,680
This is clearly
a play about an illicit love affair.

83
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,240
Good.

84
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,000
Since then,

85
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,560
my husband
often wakes up from his dreams

86
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:10,240
and is sometimes absent-minded.

87
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,639
Maybe he was worried about my health.

88
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,600
My health is deteriorating,

89
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,439
so I can't take care of him.

90
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,439
Yet he still wanted
to pray to the gods for me

91
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,379
to dispel illness
and ward off disasters.

92
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,499
If you look at these things alone,

93
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,920
they're caused by Sun Hua's illusion.

94
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,959
But if you put them all together,

95
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,560
it's no longer a coincidence.

96
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,758
Someone deliberately
said and did these things

97
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,319
in front of Sun Hua

98
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,759
to make him think

99
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,040
he has lost his mind.

100
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:43,780
Then they deliberately set up a trap

101
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,160
to confuse him

102
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,240
whether he had killed a dog or a person,

103
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,780
inducing him to plead guilty.

104
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,639
Yes.

105
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,439
Corpse stench and maggots

106
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,350
only appear on corpses
that have been dead

107
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,319
for more than three days.

108
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,959
But there's no sign of decay

109
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,360
on the female corpse.

110
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,439
The time of death is approximately

111
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,680
one to three days.

112
00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:14,020
The thickness
of this wooden stick is wrong.

113
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,000
Such a large bruise

114
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,360
could not have been caused
by a dog-beating stick like this.

115
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:19,900
There really is something fishy
going on.

116
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,430
(Letter of Pardon)

117
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:24,399
How young and promising.

118
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,120
It was my oversight.

119
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,439
Sun Hua is indeed innocent.

120
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
He can be released.

121
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,279
Magistrate Wang.

122
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:35,719
When are we sending someone

123
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,720
to Yang Hewen's residence
to investigate?

124
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,040
I've said it many times.

125
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,360
There's no proof.

126
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,199
How can you break into people's homes?

127
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,199
The stench and maggots on that body

128
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,160
are proof

129
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:48,700
that more than one person is dead.

130
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,279
Someone else was probably

131
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:51,580
at where the corpse was buried.

132
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:53,560
We've dug the wasteland

133
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,160
north of the city as you asked.

134
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,959
There's nothing.

135
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:58,000
You knew

136
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,220
that the place where the body was found
wasn't where the crime was committed.

137
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,000
We want you to check
Yang Hewen's residence.

138
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,560
If there is a case, of course
we have to investigate it thoroughly.

139
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,759
We can't let go of any suspicion,

140
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,319
but Yang Hewen's name

141
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,480
isn't written on the corpse.

142
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,959
Listen to yourself.

143
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,279
- Darling.
- Darling.

144
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,639
Does it hurt?

145
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,879
I'm fine.

146
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,759
Everything will be fine.

147
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,319
It's over now.

148
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm alright now.

149
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,360
These two men and this lady

150
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,319
helped save you.

151
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,319
I will

152
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,079
never forget your kindness.

153
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,839
If you ever need me

154
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,240
in any way,

155
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,639
I will do my best to help you.

156
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,040
It's not a big deal.

157
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,240
It's just

158
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,319
that we have a lot of questions for you.

159
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,560
Did you pray to gods

160
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,399
for your wife's illness?

161
00:07:25,739 --> 00:07:26,900
Did you pray to Heming Deity?

162
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,720
Although

163
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,759
Heming Deity isn't a legitimate deity,

164
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,360
many people here believe him.

165
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,519
What does Yang Hewen do?

166
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,439
He's Heming Deity's shaman.

167
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:41,160
It is said that worshipping Heming Deity

168
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,120
guarantees eternal peace

169
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,480
and happiness.

170
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So you went to him for help

171
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,999
because your wife
has been ill for a long time.

172
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,959
Yes,

173
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,079
but I couldn't comply

174
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,759
with his request.

175
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,759
Is it after you came back
from Yang Hewen's place

176
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,040
that you started becoming delirious?

177
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,360
Yes.

178
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:04,179
I've only been able to sober up
these days.

179
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,820
Could you take us to the place

180
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,399
where the anomaly occurred?

181
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,160
Sure.

182
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,079
Carry it there.

183
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,000
Hurry. Keep up.

184
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,120
- Move faster.
- Coming.

185
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,279
You're quite strong.

186
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:20,900
You wheel such a big bucket by yourself.

187
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:24,000
All the proof points here,

188
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:26,279
but we can't come in openly.

189
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,150
On the surface,
he appears to be renovating the yard,

190
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,750
but in reality,

191
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,140
he's trying to destroy the proof.

192
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,639
How annoying!

193
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,480
Remember those grave robbers we busted

194
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,240
on the ghost opera case?

195
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,760
I found this

196
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,700
when I was collecting their loot.

197
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:53,720
Just stick it into the soil

198
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,100
and the soil that comes out

199
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,039
will tell us

200
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,679
if there's anything underground.

201
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,639
You're really clever.

202
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,440
We'll put one in every seven feet.

203
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:06,700
If the deduction is correct,

204
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,500
there will be
unusual soil or bloodstains

205
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,559
on the bamboo stick.

206
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,919
At this time of year,

207
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,720
a corpse will begin to rot within a day.

208
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,919
I guess the corpse
was buried in somewhere damp.

209
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,000
The green marks on the corpse

210
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,739
should be left by the plants
when it was being dragged,

211
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,250
but there aren't many scratches.

212
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,840
It means

213
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,540
that the dragging distance
mustn't be far.

214
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,279
How tiring.

215
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,120
I wonder

216
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,200
if Song has prepared food for us.

217
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:30,759
Found it.

218
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,120
It's been a while, Inquisitor Song.

219
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,759
Mr. Zhou, are you here

220
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,519
for something
I'm secretly investigating?

221
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,080
You should know

222
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,960
(Mr. Zhou)
what case I'm here for.

223
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,279
Mr. Zhou, do you know

224
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:47,679
that I

225
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,000
almost lost my life for this?

226
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,879
It's indeed a bit much.

227
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,480
But Inquisitor Song,

228
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,679
it's you

229
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,919
wants to force others to death first.

230
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,320
I don't know who the main culprit is,

231
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,200
but being able to invite you here

232
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,360
greatly narrowed the scope.

233
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,000
You owe me.

234
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,759
I owe someone else too.

235
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,840
Isn't this exactly

236
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,399
how the bureaucracy and life are?

237
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,799
So did you come here

238
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,039
to ask me

239
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,159
to repay your kindness
in recommending me?

240
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,840
Let that person go first.

241
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
Let him go?

242
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,120
Do you know what crime he committed?

243
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,120
Because of this case,

244
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,159
I feel guilty

245
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,039
can't sleep well.

246
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,639
Don't be scared.

247
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,480
If you don't speak up,

248
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,200
more children

249
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,279
like you

250
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:42,919
will be hurt by them.

251
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,799
I will protect you.

252
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,759
It's just a few civilian children.

253
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,240
Just?

254
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:58,399
Do you know the torture
they suffered before they died?

255
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,759
He's in a high position

256
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,720
but treat people as insignificant

257
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:06,000
and foster evil.

258
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,679
So,

259
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,940
are you going to sacrifice
your young friends

260
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,080
