00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,940
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,378
What have I done wrong?

4
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:50,130
What did I do to deserve this?

5
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,578
If you were righteous,

6
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:54,850
why would you fight the officers?

7
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:56,298
I am but a helpless woman.

8
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:58,250
Who knows if you are up to no good?

9
00:00:58,339 --> 00:00:59,570
Stop denying.

10
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:00,859
Deng Guang told us everything.

11
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,819
I don't know
that good-for-nothing Deng Guang.

12
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,338
How could you punish us

13
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:05,899
based only on his statements?

14
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,539
Yeah.

15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,739
We are good people.

16
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:08,978
- Yeah.
- That's right.

17
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:10,539
We are a troupe that was passing by.

18
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,049
We are just singers and actors.

19
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,698
We may be actors,

20
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,099
but unlike you,

21
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,530
we are not criminals.

22
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:17,769
So, you're a troupe.

23
00:01:18,139 --> 00:01:19,849
I'd like to see

24
00:01:20,339 --> 00:01:22,260
which play you specialize in.

25
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,138
"The Story of the Boudoir",
"The Tale of Adversity",

26
00:01:24,139 --> 00:01:26,609
"The Chaste Maiden Zhao and Cai Erlang",
and "Returning to Dreamland".

27
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:30,450
I watched "The Tale of Adversity"
when I was little. It was remarkable.

28
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,090
I'd love to watch it again.

29
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,609
The script has been lost
for over a decade.

30
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:40,810
We heard about it,
but never performed it.

31
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:42,939
Who would've thought?

32
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,450
We're in the presence of masters.

33
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,138
The play was unpopular.
We stopped performing it.

34
00:01:48,139 --> 00:01:49,778
Yeah, we don't perform this play.

35
00:01:49,779 --> 00:01:51,299
But you should still remember it.

36
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,138
You get to perform
while proving your innocence.

37
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:56,209
Even the thought of it is joyful.

38
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:58,569
Bring it here.

39
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,890
These are the costumes and props

40
00:02:01,419 --> 00:02:03,769
we found at your quarters.

41
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:06,969
Put them on and let the show begin.

42
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:14,090
You're alive.

43
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:16,259
I knew it.

44
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,899
You heard about the passing
of a wealthy man.

45
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,938
Hence, you disguised as a ghost troupe
to rob his grave.

46
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:23,859
But Deng Guang ruined your plan.

47
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,019
Out of anger,

48
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,490
you trapped him in a coffin
to eliminate him.

49
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,770
Is that it?

50
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,889
Yes

51
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,370
and no.

52
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:37,098
Great! Nice singing!

53
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:38,098
Deng Guang is here.

54
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,098
Great show!

55
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:40,139
Kill him now.

56
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,930
Can I have the money now?

57
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,778
Don't be rash.

58
00:02:43,779 --> 00:02:45,050
Stick to the plan.

59
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:46,538
You used the play you heard about

60
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:48,129
but never watched.

61
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,330
I bet

62
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,739
it wasn't just to kill Deng Guang.

63
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,610
Why do good people

64
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,569
live a short life

65
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,770
while the villains thrive?

66
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,419
Deng Guang was a gambler.

67
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,129
He sold poison.

68
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:06,778
He made the living

69
00:03:06,779 --> 00:03:08,179
addict to his poison

70
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,009
to make a fortune
until their last breath.

71
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,899
After they died,

72
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,818
he stole the grave goods
left behind by the deceased's family.

73
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,610
He is utterly devoid of conscience.

74
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:19,179
He would bleed a man dry even in death.

75
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,338
He deserves the worst death!

76
00:03:20,339 --> 00:03:23,129
Deng Guang is hopeless.

77
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,050
Why didn't you stop your family?

78
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,658
Any normal family

79
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,050
would be ashamed of

80
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,859
purchasing this medicine.

81
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,370
They wouldn't tell anyone.

82
00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:34,210
When the person dies,

83
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,370
the secret will be safe.

84
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:38,019
Many sought help from the doctor

85
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,530
for a glimpse of hope.

86
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:42,770
But they ended up
throwing their lives away.

87
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,810
I thought my father was already dying.

88
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:50,569
But mere days ago, I learned

89
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,969
that my father didn't die
from any sickness.

90
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,770
He was addicted to a poison!

91
00:03:54,779 --> 00:03:56,218
My father too.

92
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:58,210
My brothers died the same way.

93
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:01,930
We investigated

94
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:03,098
and found that our families

95
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:05,449
knew a man called Deng Guang.

96
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:06,938
After every few successes,

97
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:08,699
he'd flee to a different town.

98
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,378
We tracked him down and found him

99
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:12,009
when Baron Wang was buried.

100
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,050
Why didn't you kill him right away?

101
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,850
Why go through the trouble
of disguising as ghosts?

102
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,930
Killing him

103
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:23,410
would be too much mercy for him.

104
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:27,610
I want his soul

105
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:29,019
to be tortured,

106
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,050
torn apart, and crushed!

107
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,370
We lured him in dressing as ghosts

108
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,778
so he could learn

109
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,089
what it feels like to be swindled.

110
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:45,209
We trapped him in a coffin

111
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,139
to be a grave good

112
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,170
so he could lose hope
as his life faded away!

113
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:54,689
I can't allow the world to remember him

114
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:58,170
as the drunkard who was murdered.

115
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,370
I want him to be remembered

116
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:03,738
as the most accursed devil
who has committed heinous crimes.

117
00:05:03,739 --> 00:05:05,019
He must suffer for all eternity!

118
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,730
Spare us your righteous speech.

119
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,769
Deng Guang deserves the worst death.

120
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,499
But right from the start,

121
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,410
you used the ghost troupe

122
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:16,569
to spread terror

123
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,259
so no one would investigate.

124
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,930
So you could get away with it.

125
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,329
You thought you were doing good
with violence,

126
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:25,050
but you are fighting violence
with more violence!

127
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,889
You tarnished the play

128
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,209
and brought shame to the dead.

129
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,059
You were born with a beautiful voice.

130
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,338
You should be singing

131
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:35,338
the graceful melodies of the world,

132
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:37,250
not disguising as malevolent ghosts.

133
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:39,050
You are a disgrace

134
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,970
to your parents.

135
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,889
When I was little,

136
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,129
I love watching and singing operas
with my father.

137
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,329
I'd like to talk to him again.

138
00:06:08,739 --> 00:06:11,970
No matter how ashamed he was
of his condition,

139
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:15,970
he could've told us
so we could overcome it as a family.

140
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,769
But it's too late now.

141
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,689
Death took him from me.

142
00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:26,218
Mu Qing, Wang Youde,
and the others disguised as a ghost troupe

143
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,689
to murder Deng Guang.
This is an unforgivable crime.

144
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,290
Lock them up!

145
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,529
- Yes!
- What about Deng Guang?

146
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,819
- What about Deng Guang?
- Move!

147
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,178
- You deserve to die too!
- Move!

148
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:40,778
Deng Guang is a fraud and a murderer.

149
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:42,329
He will be jailed as well.

150
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,170
You'll pay for this!

151
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,290
My husband.

152
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:14,990
(Tomb of Wang Lihuan)

153
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:16,978
This time,

154
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,250
let my husband be at peace.

155
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:22,009
I heard you are playwrights.

156
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,889
Why not turn this case into a play?

157
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:27,410
The world should learn

158
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,449
about this hysterical tragedy.

159
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,810
The case is solved. He is avenged.

160
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,490
Let's celebrate with a roasted chicken.

161
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,899
Pack our things.

162
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,059
Don't overstay the inn.

163
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,159
The old man is paying.

164
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,298
(Tomb of Wang Lihuan)

165
00:07:41,299 --> 00:07:43,689
You manipulated them
into killing Deng Guang.

166
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,529
That day at the court,

167
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,139
Mu Qing said

168
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,658
she only learned about the cause

169
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:52,769
of her father's death mere days ago.

170
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,129
Who told her that?

171
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,410
And who told the others?

172
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,129
How should I know?

173
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,089
You tried to undermine
the investigation.

174
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,819
You knew

175
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,970
they had trapped Deng Guang inside.

176
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,098
You wanted Deng Guang

177
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:11,170
to be buried with your husband.

178
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,610
You let us exhume his remains

179
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,089
out of pressure

180
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:18,259
only because Deng Guang

181
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,569
could either play dead or fool.

182
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,178
As soon as he talked,

183
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:25,730
he would've exposed himself.

184
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,930
That is a serious accusation.

185
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,250
Mu Qing didn't rat you out.

186
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,289
But we caught a scent from her.

187
00:08:34,819 --> 00:08:37,049
One, the black locust scent
from the inn.

188
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,850
The other

189
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,970
was the incense that filled your house.

190
00:08:43,699 --> 00:08:46,649
After it is done,
simply pay us and stay hidden.

191
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:48,658
Those investigators ruined our plan

192
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:50,499
by saving that actress.

193
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,250
You could be a suspect as well.

194
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,450
They got in my way.

195
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:57,210
After the job is done,

196
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:01,490
take the money and leave.

197
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,929
It was you

198
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:06,330
who manipulated us into
catching the ghost troupe.

199
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:08,730
You were clear of all suspicion.

200
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,490
So why do you drink the poisoned liquor?

201
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,570
I guess

202
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,370
the real murderer
who took your husband's life was you.

203
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,889
After we got married,

204
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,450
I couldn't conceive a child.

205
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,499
I didn't want my husband
to become addicted

206
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,850
to Deng Guang's poison

207
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,250
and lose himself.

208
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,370
Deng Guang used
that secret to blackmail him.

209
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,250
He had already

210
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,169
bled our family dry.

211
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:42,538
And in the end,

212
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:44,889
my husband even lost his life.

213
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,169
I've lost everything.

214
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:50,330
I've lost the purpose to live.

215
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,099
Deng Guang may be unforgivable,

216
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,690
but the law of the Great Song
will punish him.

217
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,769
You are not exacting justice.

218
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,409
Hiring murderers

219
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,169
is the same as committing murder.

220
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:03,690
Moments ago,

221
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:06,490
I switched the poison out.

222
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,850
What?

223
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:10,970
When wealth is lost,

224
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,850
it can be rebuilt.

225
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,370
When a lover is lost,

226
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,090
you can still look for new love.

227
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,649
Not having children is not a flaw.

228
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,529
But Baron Wang can't be
brought back to life.

229
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,409
Years of lies from his wife
cost him his life.

230
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:32,409
There's hope now that
I have the medicine.

231
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,058
My wife and I have been
married for years.

232
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:36,259
We can't bear a child.

233
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,058
I know she loves playing with kids.

234
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:41,529
We shall have a happy family soon.

235
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:42,538
Yeah.

236
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:44,009
A wonderful family indeed.

237
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,418
There's more?

238
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:45,979
Yes.

239
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,649
I'll buy every last bit you have.

240
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,330
Actually,

241
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:52,619
the person who couldn't bear a child

242
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,929
and brought this misfortune
unto him was me.

243
00:10:57,539 --> 00:10:58,698
You three

244
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,330
were strangers to her,

245
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,499
but you went out of your way
to purchase her freedom

246
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,450
and prove her innocence.

247
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,979
But after years of marriage,

248
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,210
I couldn't entrust my husband
with the secret.

249
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:14,009
I wanted to kill Deng Guang
with the troupe.

250
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,529
I can run from my crime,

251
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:19,259
but never

252
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,929
the guilt that haunts my heart.

253
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,778
Which was why

254
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:25,578
you prepared a coffin for yourself

255
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:27,929
next to Baron Wang's grave.

256
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:32,210
You thought you could join him in death.

257
00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:35,259
Not a chance!

258
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,169
That would be too merciful for you.

259
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:39,649
Turn yourself in.

260
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,610
Repent and regret it

261
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,490
in your prison cell.

262
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,818
(Tomb of Wang Lihuan)

263
00:11:56,819 --> 00:11:57,889
Sir,

264
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,458
I just realized

265
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:01,850
that you weren't a fool.

266
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,690
You have your reasons.

267
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,009
I won't pry

268
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:07,570
if you can't tell me.

269
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:11,889
Much obliged, young lady.

270
00:12:28,939 --> 00:12:30,169
Who is it?

271
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,339
Li Er.

272
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,889
I want my head back.

273
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:38,409
Huang Santai!

274
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,570
