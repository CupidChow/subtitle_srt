00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,340
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,100
Inquisitor Song.

4
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,100
I'm a sinner.

5
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,900
I'm no longer an inquisitor.

6
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,860
Do you like operas?

7
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,130
I used to.

8
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,260
Throughout my life,

9
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,300
I've witnessed
the harsh reality of the world.

10
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,130
I've seen misery and joy.

11
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,210
I've seen how unpredictable
people can be.

12
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,210
I've seen loved ones
separated by death.

13
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,380
I'm weary.

14
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,180
I've had enough of this.

15
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,210
Are you aware in my eyes,

16
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,460
you've always been

17
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,029
loyal, honorable,

18
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,180
and never shied away
from bold criticisms?

19
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,460
If anyone in the court

20
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,180
would dare tell the truth,

21
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,410
it would be you, Song Ci.

22
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,820
What's the truth

23
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,100
behind the case with the lotus mark?

24
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,210
I want you to reopen the case.

25
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,570
I...

26
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,890
I am grateful for this opportunity.

27
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,759
These are the kids I received.

28
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,989
I'll send them to the backyard.

29
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,359
The Old Master has been paranoid.

30
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,869
We might need even more heart blood.

31
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,429
Send in more as soon as possible.

32
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,620
Yes.

33
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,730
Old Master!

34
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:48,669
Old Master!

35
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,410
His Majesty summoned Song Ci.

36
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,570
I thought he was jailed.

37
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,340
Why did His Majesty talk to him?

38
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,269
Someone turned the case into operas

39
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,639
and spread them across Lin'an.

40
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,100
Even His Majesty

41
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,570
watched them.

42
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,220
Song!

43
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,730
Song!

44
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,709
I've missed you.

45
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,940
Song!

46
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,850
Did they hurt you?

47
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,850
Do you still have the remains?

48
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,170
Did you get hurt?

49
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,060
How have you been, Vice Minister Jia?

50
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,970
I've been well.

51
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,989
Officer, thanks for your concern.

52
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,820
Glad to hear you've been well.

53
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,690
Inquisitor Song has been released.

54
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,130
He told His Majesty
unpleasant things about you.

55
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,780
However, His Majesty still trusts you.

56
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,340
Perhaps you could reconcile
with Inquisitor Song

57
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,199
and clear the misunderstanding.

58
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,450
That should appease the people.

59
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,500
Thanks for your advice.

60
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,220
I'll do as you suggest.

61
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,380
Song Ci.

62
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,639
May I know why you've summoned me

63
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,420
to the court?

64
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,349
You're the prime suspect
in a case a discarded corpses.

65
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,119
How dare you?

66
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,860
Who got the girl killed
in the administrative office?

67
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,679
You were the real killer.

68
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,530
When I investigated,

69
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,820
you've tried to take my life
more than once.

70
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,679
You have plenty of enemies.

71
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,940
I'm not the only one

72
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,759
who wishes you dead.

73
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,180
Do you plead guilty

74
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,349
or not?

75
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,180
Nothing but slanders.

76
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,860
Guards.

77
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,770
We'll examine the corpses.

78
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,650
If the fracture shows red,

79
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,650
it means it was broken
when the victim was alive.

80
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,260
Otherwise,

81
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,300
the fracture was inflicted post-mortem.

82
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,010
The direction of the trauma

83
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,890
is to the right.

84
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,330
It means the murderer

85
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,130
was left-handed.

86
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,820
Jia Zhen.

87
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,959
Wherever you were assigned,

88
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,269
there were always

89
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,620
cases of discarded corpses.

90
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,180
The victims were all children.

91
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,300
They were branded with a lotus mark.

92
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,450
The mark was removed after they died.

93
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,740
What excuse do you have now?

94
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,639
You point your finger at me

95
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,029
just because I am left-handed
and was an official

96
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,740
where the murders took place.

97
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,709
That is a bit of a reach.

98
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:30,330
This corpse as an extra piece of bone!

99
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,570
It's a piece of phalanx.

100
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,820
I thought

101
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,330
the child was born with six fingers.

102
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,060
But we ran a comparison.

103
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,940
That is not the case.

104
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,469
What do you want?

105
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,570
What do you want?

106
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,349
If it were years ago,

107
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,570
I couldn't have noticed.

108
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,180
The child was strong-willed.

109
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,959
The child struggled and resisted

110
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,980
and bit off your finger
before swallowing it.

111
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,999
I found this lead from the girl

112
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,530
who died in the office.

113
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,980
This piece of bone

114
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:22,010
is irrefutable evidence
against your crime.

115
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,450
Jia Zhen.

116
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,199
You've committed heinous crimes

117
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,820
and are unforgivable.

118
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,260
Do you have no regard
for the law of the Great Song?

119
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,229
Guards!

120
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:31,789
Yes!

121
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,079
Seize him!

122
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,380
Yes!

123
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,130
Song.

124
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,010
We finally have a home.

125
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,119
We don't have to endure insulting alms

126
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,519
or mistreatment anymore.

127
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,940
We are independent
and capable of finding happiness.

128
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,690
We have the craft

129
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,330
to weather any challenges.

130
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,319
My dream of trying out
all the delicacies

131
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,980
will soon come true.

132
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,300
But I'm starting
to like this place more.

133
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,890
A small stage can hold a big audience.

134
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,620
I can have visitors from across the land
to cheer for me.

135
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,530
My parents would be proud

136
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,450
of what I can accomplish.

137
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,119
I used to assume

138
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,559
that only Inquisitor Song

139
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,530
could uphold justice in court.

140
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,980
But after all we've been through,

141
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,180
we've seen the many facades
of the world

142
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,740
and the people within.

143
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,580
We've seen too many sides of humanity.

144
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,890
It was brief,

145
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,930
but the stories will age well.

146
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,890
When they are written on paper,

147
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,650
they can inspire people

148
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,530
and help uphold justice

149
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,930
everywhere.

150
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,650
Inquisitor Song,

151
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,980
what's your plan now?

152
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,620
After Jia Zhen is executed,

153
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,650
I must leave.

154
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,100
What?

155
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,500
His Majesty reinstated me.

156
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,650
Tons of unsolved cases await me.

157
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,620
I must thank you

158
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,829
for showing me

159
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,629
that many forensic
and investigation methods

160
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,220
need improvements.

161
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,180
(Song Ci's Cases of Rectified Injustice)

162
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,959
I compiled this manuscript

163
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,500
over the past few days.

164
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,290
Take it.

165
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,650
I hope it turns into a big collection.

166
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,010
(Song Ci's Cases of Rectified Injustice)
When I'm gone,

167
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,050
it might actually

168
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,380
help the innocent clear their names

169
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,799
and unravel the truth.

170
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,220
Inquisitor Song.

171
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,700
If you ever need our help,

172
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,620
do let us know.

173
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,770
Take this jade pendant as a token.

174
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,170
Do not forget this journey.

175
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,220
Always stay true to your heart.

176
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,410
Yes.

177
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,220
As long as we live,

178
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,860
we shall meet again.

179
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,380
Song Ci!

180
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,010
Song Ci!

181
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:23,290
Song Ci! I dare you to come closer!

182
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,620
Song Ci!

183
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,810
Do you think you've won?

184
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,829
My courtyard

185
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,770
is full of peony plants.

186
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,890
I hate lotus more than anything.

187
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,380
Take a guess.

188
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:44,050
Why were they branded
with a lotus mark?

189
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,260
Are you implying

190
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,810
the true murderer is still out there?
