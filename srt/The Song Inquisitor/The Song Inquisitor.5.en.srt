00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,940
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:48,058
Delicious!

4
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,090
Old man,

5
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,258
I heard you persuaded Madam Wang
to confess at the administrative office.

6
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:54,289
You seem quite clear-headed now.

7
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,130
Do you recall anything
about your family?

8
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,658
My mind is completely blank.

9
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,369
How would I have that ability?

10
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,370
It's all thanks to Miss He.

11
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,459
I heard the county magistrate
was dismissed from his post.

12
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,170
Someone reported his cover-up
of an unjust case to higher authorities.

13
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:14,250
That's how it is.

14
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,329
Another strange case has happened.

15
00:01:18,419 --> 00:01:20,250
Again?

16
00:01:20,419 --> 00:01:21,969
What strange case?

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,099
When the children's bodies
were found in these regions,

18
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,138
it was found that

19
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:27,090
their arms or legs were missing.

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,618
(Anyang County)

21
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,299
Why does the place I marked

22
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,769
match your map?

23
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:36,810
I don't know.

24
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:37,778
This...

25
00:01:37,779 --> 00:01:39,760
Maybe this is just my way home.

26
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,680
How could it be such a coincidence
that they are exactly the same route?

27
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,930
Your mind is always filled with cases.

28
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,739
You suspected me earlier,
and now you suspect our benefactor.

29
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,209
It's endless.

30
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,899
I decided to follow the benefactor,

31
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,120
repay his kindness and return his money
until he finds his family.

32
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,800
It's up to you whether
to come along or not.

33
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,418
I'm going!

34
00:01:56,419 --> 00:01:58,440
I can get good food
by following the old man.

35
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,019
Speaking of that,

36
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,418
you've saved the benefactor,

37
00:02:02,419 --> 00:02:04,689
but you become even
more indebted to him.

38
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,058
Along the way,

39
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,938
he sold his belongings,

40
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:09,370
and spent a lot of money.

41
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,969
You all should know it well.

42
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:12,930
I was even worried you'd all run away.

43
00:02:14,619 --> 00:02:15,818
Don't worry.

44
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:18,338
I'd definitely pay him money,
and repay his kindness.

45
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:19,770
Otherwise, I won't be able to sleep.

46
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,259
It's just a small act.

47
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,810
- Miss He, eat it.
- Just a small act.

48
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,729
Who's crying? Nonsense!

49
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:38,689
Who's there?

50
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:41,289
Stop!

51
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,770
Who is it?

52
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,650
Who?

53
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,250
Who?

54
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,810
Li Er!

55
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,090
Return my head!

56
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,169
Huang Santai! Return my head!

57
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,870
(Anyang County, Xingrong County)

58
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,729
(Hefty Reward)
200 taels.

59
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,969
They're offering this much money
to exorcise the ghost?

60
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,810
Let's go together.

61
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,019
So, we can earn money

62
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,098
and pay the travel expenses

63
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:14,409
back to the old man.

64
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,969
No need.

65
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,259
Offering so much money...

66
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,899
There must be some
huge trouble behind it.

67
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,370
With your physique,
you better don't take up the trouble.

68
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,569
What's there to fear?
We can make money if nothing happens.

69
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:26,818
If something happens,

70
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,129
we'll investigate it.

71
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,019
Watch your step!

72
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,770
Have the masters arrived?

73
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:41,930
Yes.

74
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,849
Hurry up!

75
00:04:00,619 --> 00:04:01,160
Father.

76
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,620
(Baron Li, Li Shaoren)
All the masters within a ten-mile radius

77
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,960
who can exorcise and connect
with the ghosts are here now.

78
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:08,969
Masters,

79
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,490
please stop for a moment.

80
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,139
Stop for a moment.

81
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,689
Please stop, everyone.

82
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:17,619
I believe

83
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,410
you're all aware of
the situation of my Li family.

84
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,850
Over the past two years, the ghosts have
frequently appeared in my mansion.

85
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:27,059
Just a few days ago,

86
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,129
it appeared right in front of me.

87
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,379
Baron.

88
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,610
Look,

89
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,218
every time I kill a ghost,

90
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:35,889
I leave a scar on my body.

91
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,338
As long as you provide enough...

92
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:38,098
I mean...

93
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:39,178
Enough allowance.

94
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:40,370
I can

95
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:41,139
add another scar.

96
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,290
Stop! Stop!

97
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:45,889
There are just a bunch of con artists!

98
00:04:46,179 --> 00:04:47,290
Let's leave here.

99
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:50,538
Hold on. I can smell the steamed buns.
Let's leave after the mealtime.

100
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:51,658
You're always about food.

101
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,810
Baron, you need to be discerning.

102
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,329
Don't let some schemers

103
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,459
sneak in here.

104
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,418
Even actors from the theater troupes

105
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,440
are pretending to exorcise ghosts.

106
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,858
Perhaps the feng shui
of this mansion will be disrupted.

107
00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:07,250
It's obvious there's
greater yin energy here.

108
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:10,410
Be careful not to
attract something unwanted.

109
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,970
Watch carefully.

110
00:05:28,219 --> 00:05:29,490
My blood

111
00:05:29,739 --> 00:05:31,538
can exorcise all evil spirits!

112
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,139
You're ruining

113
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,379
the props we use for performing.

114
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,689
This blood pouch is expensive!

115
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,449
Hmm...

116
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,610
Everyone,

117
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,019
I don't care who you are.

118
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,529
Within ten days, whoever first

119
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,689
helps me expel the evil spirit

120
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:50,120
will receive 200 taels
of silver as a token of appreciation.

121
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,600
The baron has prepared the rooms for all of you.
Meals and accommodations are included.

122
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,970
Everything is covered.

123
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:05,738
Where is the Inquisitor Song, Song Ci?

124
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:06,930
Take me to him!

125
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:07,819
Who?

126
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,379
Who are you talking about?

127
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,819
I don't know him.

128
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,810
The old man who was with you
earlier during the day.

129
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,170
Which room is he staying in?

130
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:17,459
This mansion is so large,

131
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,449
and I've seen plenty of men.

132
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:21,850
I can't recall.

133
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:23,730
Do you believe I'll kill you?

134
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:26,499
It's Baron Du, a guest at the mansion.

135
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,499
He wants to take me as his concubine,
but he can't afford the silver.

136
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,379
I told him not to bother me.

137
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,019
Stop playing fool with me!

138
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,290
Who's sneaking around the Li Mansion?

139
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,850
Miss, are you all right?

140
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,329
Father! Mother!

141
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,338
I don't want to die.

142
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:08,089
I still have so many wishes.

143
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,930
Uncle, won't you save us?

144
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,850
Had a nightmare?

145
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,089
Are you still worried

146
00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:31,178
about the headless ghost case

147
00:07:31,179 --> 00:07:32,370
at the Li Mansion?

148
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:35,769
I dreamt about childhood memories.

149
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,970
I couldn't figure out an answer,

150
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,730
or uncover the truth.

151
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,129
Do you still remember

152
00:07:45,179 --> 00:07:46,449
those childhood events?

153
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,250
When I was six, I was kidnapped.

154
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,529
After that, I wandered
from place to place.

155
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,209
I've long forgotten where my home was.

156
00:07:55,419 --> 00:08:00,649
That's why you got this lotus-shaped scar
after being kidnapped?

157
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,209
Along the way,

158
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:05,009
I've been dazed.

159
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:06,810
When I woke up, I would be...

160
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,290
If I had met you back then,

161
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,410
I would have given
my life to protect you.

162
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,379
What are you two doing
awake at midnight?

163
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,769
Let's sleep.

164
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:29,329
Alright, sleep.

165
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,250
Thank you, Miss Tang, for saving me.

166
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:35,120
Miss, there's no need to mention it.

167
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,020
(Maid, Tang Wan)
Since there were intruders here,

168
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,409
it was only right for us to step in.

169
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,409
It's late. Rest early.

170
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,250
Benefactor,

171
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,409
I was held hostage by someone in black.

172
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:06,929
Were you in any danger?

173
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,889
Did he trouble Miss He?

174
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:11,769
Fortunately, Miss Tang passed by
and helped me escape.

175
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,619
I've caused you trouble.

176
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,289
Benefactor, don't say that.

177
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,178
At least they won't allow the intruders

178
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:19,649
to run wild in the Li Mansion.

179
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,730
For now, we're still safe.

180
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:24,210
This journey is tough.

181
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,330
After this,

182
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,009
I'll find a better place soon.

183
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,889
Benefactor,

184
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,778
I didn't want to say thank you,
because in this world,

185
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:37,929
'thank you' is the lightest word.

186
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:40,058
I will prove this through my actions

187
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:42,649
that there's kindness
and justice in this world.

188
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:44,690
The journey ahead is uncertain.

189
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,929
It's inconvenient to take you with me.

190
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:51,169
If you're worried
I can't endure the hardship,

191
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:52,730
do you think

192
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,169
life could be harder

193
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:56,610
than when I lived in a theater?

194
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:02,409
Now that I've escaped that prison,

195
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,690
I want to see this vibrant world.

196
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:09,019
But, how do you know traveling with me

197
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,769
will lead to a smoother path?

198
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,899
I could just tell it now.

199
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,769
You can't bear to see a woman cry.

200
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:19,610
You must have a kind heart.

201
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,418
So, traveling together

202
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:22,889
must be a smooth path.

203
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,690
Benefactor, since you need
to keep a low profile,

204
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,690
I'll cover for you.

205
00:10:28,819 --> 00:10:30,379
It will only benefit

206
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,009
whatever you seek to do.

207
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:35,009
