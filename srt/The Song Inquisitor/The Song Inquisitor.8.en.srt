=Episode 8=

3
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:49,618
I was so afraid in the prison
these past few days.

4
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:51,130
- It's okay.
- I'm starving too.

5
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,250
He Wenning!

6
00:00:57,019 --> 00:00:58,170
Miss He!

7
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,929
He Wenning never lets
her water pouch leave her side

8
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,049
Something must have happened to her!

9
00:01:04,179 --> 00:01:05,849
He Wenning! He Wenning!

10
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,329
He Wenning! He Wenning!

11
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,090
He Wenning!

12
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:15,849
You have no mercy at all.

13
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:17,730
Get a needle here.

14
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,129
I'm going to do a bloodletting.

15
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,569
Here.

16
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,699
What a pain prickle!

17
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,730
You...

18
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,170
I was just worried about you!

19
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:36,450
Couldn't you tell I was
pretending to faint?

20
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:39,280
When I was drinking water,

21
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,519
I realized the mark on the
wooden stopper of my water pouch

22
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,769
wasn't in the usual fixed position.

23
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,859
I had already planned with my benefactor

24
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:48,200
to deliberately make a big show
of investigating the case in the mansion

25
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,309
and to feign being poisoned,

26
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,499
just to see

27
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,090
who in this mansion might slip up.

28
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,339
With such obvious flaws in your ploy,

29
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,170
do you think the murderer
would fall for it?

30
00:01:58,179 --> 00:01:59,730
It worked on me.

31
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,569
Don't scare me anymore.

32
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,609
But,

33
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,409
I did come across
a similar case in a book.

34
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:09,379
The Inquisitor Song mentioned those
who deal with head-removing affairs

35
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,329
would certainly not
want unnecessary complications.

36
00:02:11,329 --> 00:02:14,409
The only reason the murderer
pretended to be a ghost

37
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:17,330
was to conceal the time of death.

38
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,219
You've already found a clue just after
coming out from the prison.

39
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,458
You're impressive.

40
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,689
This is a crucial clue for the case.

41
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,099
We must keep it safe.

42
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,298
Keep it, keep it.

43
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:33,650
I'll definitely keep it well.

44
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:41,419
Listen to these footsteps,

45
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,930
it's Li Shaoren's.

46
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,569
He's also a suspect.

47
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,419
Baron Li is stingy

48
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,659
and has offended many people.

49
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,610
He's not even close
to his wife and children.

50
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:50,939
In his life,

51
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,178
he only loved money.

52
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:53,560
Only loved money?

53
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,320
Baron Li and his son have been
not getting along well.

54
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,490
He refused a postmortem
at the time of the incident.

55
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:59,210
I've already reported the case.

56
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,530
None of you shouldn't
come closer to him,

57
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,178
nor leave this place.

58
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:06,219
After the person died, he rushed
to close the case and told us to leave.

59
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,370
The mansion no longer needed
to exorcise the ghosts.

60
00:03:08,499 --> 00:03:09,849
If you want to leave,

61
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,849
leave before the dawn.

62
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,650
We must have missed some clues.

63
00:03:22,059 --> 00:03:23,370
Found it!

64
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,729
Magistrate Zhang
interrogated everyone just now.

65
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,050
On the night of the incident,
everyone had an alibi.

66
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,859
Li Shaoren, where were you?

67
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,090
I was in my room.

68
00:03:38,179 --> 00:03:39,458
The servants can vouch for me.

69
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:41,040
What about the day before the incident?

70
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,898
I went out for a stroll.
Is that not allowed?

71
00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:45,018
Did anyone see you?

72
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:45,738
No.

73
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:47,129
Why were you strolling?

74
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,139
Could it be to release your anger

75
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,770
after an argument with Baron Li?

76
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,979
Baron Li's time of death

77
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,578
was more than a night
before we discovered it.

78
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:57,898
When you were out strolling,

79
00:03:57,899 --> 00:03:59,498
that was exactly
the time of the incident.

80
00:03:59,499 --> 00:04:01,610
Li Shaoren, where did you
go at that time?

81
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:06,699
The person without
an alibi is the culprit?

82
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,058
Ridiculous!

83
00:04:08,059 --> 00:04:09,379
I may not have a witness,

84
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,610
but what about you all?

85
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,250
Do you have evidence?

86
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,810
This knife was found in your room.

87
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,779
The nick on the knife

88
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,930
perfectly matches the wound
on Baron Li's neck.

89
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:28,810
There's your name engraved
on the knife too.

90
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,329
The character "Ren".

91
00:04:31,299 --> 00:04:32,440
The evidence is irrefutable.

92
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,019
You ungrateful son,
daring to murder your own father.

93
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,539
What a heinous crime!

94
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,258
Take him away!

95
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:38,370
No need.

96
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,050
I'll go myself.

97
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:49,579
(Inspector of Criminal Justice)
Sir, your token

98
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,810
has already indirectly saved two lives.

99
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:55,339
Inquisitor Song,
whom Zhao Zhiting always mentioned,

100
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,009
seemed to be with us at every turn.

101
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,529
No mention of Inquisitor Song.

102
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:04,850
It's just an empty title that won't
go along with one in life or death.

103
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,290
It's nothing compared to the freedom
of solving cases with you all.

104
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,889
Here you go!

105
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,138
Old man,

106
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,810
in my life, besides my late parents,

107
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,329
only you have ever
peeled chestnuts for me.

108
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,019
Look, your hands are dirty now.

109
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,410
No worries.

110
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,730
I wonder if my
eyesight was getting poor,

111
00:05:40,059 --> 00:05:42,449
but I thought I saw dirt marks

112
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,449
on Li Shaoren's hands.

113
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,539
If Li Shaoren wanted
to get away with it,

114
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,529
why didn't he dispose
of the murder weapon,

115
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,050
but keep it with him

116
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,209
and wait to be discovered?

117
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,689
Why would he do that?

118
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,138
I'm so tired.

119
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:59,258
I just wanted to go out
for a drink last night,

120
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:01,138
and I saw Baron Li
rushing to the pavilion

121
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,050
from over the wall.

122
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,089
Miss He,

123
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:08,370
where are we going
to investigate next after this?

124
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:10,850
Wait a minute.

125
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:12,769
From behind this fake rock,

126
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,738
you could see Baron Li running over?

127
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:16,089
Yes, I could.

128
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:22,339
Fatty,

129
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,899
can you see me from there?

130
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,170
No, but I can hear you.

131
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:30,649
If the murderer was Li Shaoren,

132
00:06:30,739 --> 00:06:32,618
holding Baron Li's
severed head as he moved

133
00:06:32,619 --> 00:06:33,970
would make him so conspicuous.

134
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,329
It's impossible for people nearby
not to notice the unusual.

135
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:41,370
So, the murderer must be
shorter than Baron Li.

136
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,810
Wrong.

137
00:06:47,299 --> 00:06:48,698
This Li Mansion

138
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,689
is full of headless ghosts.

139
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:53,339
It was Huang Santai at first,

140
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,449
then Baron Li.

141
00:06:58,179 --> 00:06:59,689
- Huang Santai?
- Come on.

142
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,370
Huang Santai?

143
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:04,370
This case happened years ago.

144
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,410
Does Inquisitor Song
have you investigate it?

145
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:14,730
When Baron Li was young,

146
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,490
he accidentally discovered a secret
about Huang Santai's wife.

147
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:25,529
To satisfy his desire for gossip,

148
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,089
he slandered a
virtuous woman's reputation.

149
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:31,419
Huang Santai's wife had

150
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,618
a beautiful flower-shaped
birthmark on her back.

151
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,569
Really?

152
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,089
But the rumors spread swiftly.

153
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,138
No matter how she tried
to defend herself, it was useless.

154
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:45,019
It happened all due
to her lost handkerchief.

155
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,329
Huang Santai's wife was unable
to bear the gossip

156
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,490
and chose to commit suicide
to prove her innocence.

157
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:53,378
Soon, Huang Santai found Baron Li

158
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:54,698
and slashed at him furiously.

159
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:55,818
Baron Li!

160
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:57,579
I must kill you today!

161
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,539
Dang it! Useless man!

162
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,258
Let go of me!

163
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:03,370
He was lucky to be saved
as the clan intervened.

164
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:05,490
Though I loathe Baron Li

165
00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:07,970
for ruining a woman's reputation
and causing her death,

166
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,769
Huang Santai's

167
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:13,730
attempt to murder is
still a crime under the law.

168
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,579
According to Song Dynasty Law,

169
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,258
attempted murder, even if unsuccessful,

170
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:19,449
warrants

171
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:21,730
the beheaded penalty.

172
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,449
Baron Li!

173
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,009
I won't let you go
even if I become a ghost.

174
00:08:31,299 --> 00:08:34,370
Huang Santai cursed
Baron Li before his death,

175
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:37,289
swearing to come back and take his life.

176
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,059
This case has not yet been clarified.

177
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,538
Thank you all for your assistance

178
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:46,418
in solving the headless
ghost case in time.

179
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:47,498
Magistrate Zhang,

180
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:50,250
Li Shaoren banged his head
on the ground and desperately wanted to die.
