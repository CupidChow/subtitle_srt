2
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,340
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,159
She has only been dead for a few days.

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,200
How can there
be such a strong smell of a corpse?

5
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,240
The wound on the corpse's head

6
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,119
is undoubtedly caused by a blunt object,

7
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:58,560
but

8
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:00,359
something feels wrong.

9
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,359
Cover the corpse with oil paper
soaked in scallion and vinegar.

10
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,359
And the wounds on the body
will show themselves.

11
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,519
Put it all over the corpse

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,599
like I did.

13
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:12,920
Sure.

14
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,599
How many beatings

15
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:18,920
did she receive in her lifetime?

16
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,480
Mud and sand are common,

17
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,840
but where is this sawdust from?

18
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:33,239
There's something here.

19
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,959
There are so many maggots.

20
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,920
Lit up.

21
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,480
Extinguished.

22
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,159
Moved.

23
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,560
Thrown away.

24
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,480
Cried.

25
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,040
Died.

26
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,359
This guy is obviously crazy.

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,760
What died?

28
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,480
Dog.

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,680
The dog died.

30
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,000
The dog died.

31
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,799
Sober up.

32
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,560
Your wife is still out there
working hard for you.

33
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,800
- Don't give up.
- My wife.

34
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,879
My wife is ill.

35
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,439
She's still working hard for me
even though she's sick.

36
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,680
I'm causing trouble for her.

37
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,520
I should die.

38
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,439
I should die.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,240
I'm a loser.

40
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:28,800
- But this guy clearly isn't crazy.
- I should die.

41
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,439
I'm useless.

42
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:36,240
Did your husband behave unusually
before the incident?

43
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,439
He often talked in his dreams

44
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,919
about lanterns flickering

45
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,199
objects around him moving,

46
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,400
and things being thrown.

47
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,200
My husband has always loved
watching shadow puppet plays,

48
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,550
but a few days ago he told me

49
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,200
that he didn't want to watch it anymore.

50
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,280
We've been married for years.

51
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,960
He always shares the good news
but never the bad.

52
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,479
I even heard this from the servants.

53
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,400
They said

54
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,560
he said it in his dream.

55
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,999
But everything Sun Hua said
in the county administrative office

56
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:07,000
was verified.

57
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,879
Someone's trying to set him up.

58
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,560
Do you remember the day of the trial?

59
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,599
Darling.

60
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,360
Are you telling us or not?

61
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,999
Where did you bury the body?

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,120
North of the city.

63
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,280
North of the city.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,600
A night raid on the north of the city...

65
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,920
amidst the shadows of flowers.

66
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,880
I can't figure out

67
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,120
why he said north of the city.

68
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,960
That's strange.

69
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,319
Why is there really a corpse there?

70
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,350
Did anything strange happen

71
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,199
before and after he mentioned
north of the city?

72
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,439
Do you remember?

73
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,000
Let's go.

74
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,400
Someone seemed to leave.

75
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,960
Don't try to fool me.

76
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,080
It occurred to me

77
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,000
that Yang Hewen's carriage was outside
the county administrative office,

78
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,120
but he wasn't around.

79
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,319
Who is Yang Hewen?

80
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,280
Yang Hewen is a famous local gentry.

81
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,680
He's a kind man.

82
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,759
My husband said he had met him before.

83
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,080
But my husband
seemed to have become absent-minded

84
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,039
since meeting him.

85
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,520
A kind man?

86
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,080
Why did he go to Yang Hewen?

87
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,080
He didn't tell me.

88
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,639
Strange.

89
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:16,600
What's wrong?

90
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,399
People born in a yin year,
yin month, and yin day

91
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,680
are rare.

92
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,519
Look.

93
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,480
There are two here.

94
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,680
And here.

95
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,160
Song found out

96
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,680
that all of them,
including the lady who Sun Hua killed,

97
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,720
were guilty of capital crimes,

98
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,199
but there are many suspicions.

99
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,759
This is a fake death.

100
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,990
(Liang Anning, Liu Huaichu, Sun Hua)
This is a carriage murder.

101
00:04:43,999 --> 00:04:45,519
This dismembered a corpse in a cave.

102
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,360
This murdered her lover.

103
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,839
They all had motives,

104
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,399
but their methods were strange.

105
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,240
What's even more strange

106
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,639
is that they committed
the crimes in different years,

107
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,079
but they were all born on a yin year,
yin day and yin month.

108
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,199
This is no coincidence.

109
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,399
The people at the coffin home said

110
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,680
that the remains
of the unclaimed criminals

111
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,839
were collected by Yang Hewen,

112
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,480
a kind-hearted man in this county.

113
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,800
It's Yang Hewen again.

114
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,319
Then let's go see

115
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,839
what's weird over there.

116
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,439
You guys,

117
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,360
control your expressions.

118
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,360
Song.

119
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,319
You seemed unfamiliar.

120
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,319
How come I've never seen you before?

121
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,160
We're just like everyone else.

122
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,079
You're not believers.

123
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,080
(Local Gentry Yang Hewen)
Stop pretending.

124
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,720
Are you Yang Hewen?

125
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,360
You're interesting.

126
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,160
You came to my residence
but asked me who I was.

127
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,839
How rude.

128
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,500
We were just passing by

129
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,240
and came in to take a look
after seeing how lively it is in here.

130
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,560
We're envious of you.

131
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,240
You invited so many friends

132
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,360
to your residence.

133
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,600
What's so strange about this?

134
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,439
We

135
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:53,240
all got to know each other
because of Heming Deity.

136
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,680
Heming Deity?

137
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,200
Rumor has it that Heming Deity
is also known as Heri Deity.

138
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,000
He wants blood sacrifice.

139
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,120
So what

140
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,720
if he does?

141
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,120
These people

142
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,560
are entrusted
by Magistrate Wang of this county

143
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,879
to investigate the dog corpse case.

144
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:14,930
We informed

145
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,720
the county administrative office
that we would be here before we came.

146
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,959
Do you dare to stop us?

147
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,519
I can do whatever I want

148
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,680
in my residence.

149
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,560
What's the matter?

150
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,879
Did you find out anything?

151
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,560
How do you explain the bloodstains

152
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
found in your residence?

153
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,839
Is it illegal for me
to slaughter pigs and sheep

154
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,120
to treat my guests?

155
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:40,120
You can't deny

156
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,199
this bloodstained women's clothes,
can you?

157
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:44,920
I like to watch women slaughter sheep

158
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,240
and spilling blood.

159
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,240
Is that unusual?

160
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,240
This bloodstained clothes is mine.

161
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,199
You wench.

162
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,519
You made the authorities
accuse me wrongly.

163
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,600
You freak.

164
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,920
You're bullying a weak woman like her.

165
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,160
You broke into my residence
with the intent to steal.

166
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,360
Do you have a death wish?

167
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,480
I like to see you vulnerable.

168
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,399
How beautiful.

169
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,439
Let's go.

170
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,639
Remember these people's faces.

171
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,039
Don't let them in again.

172
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,960
