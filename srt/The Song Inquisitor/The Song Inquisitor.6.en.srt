=Episode 6=

3
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,800
The Li Mansion provides
food and accommodation.

4
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:51,161
Why not stay a few more days?

5
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:54,360
Those so-called
ghost-expelling masters are useless.

6
00:00:54,441 --> 00:00:55,760
If we want to get to the bottom

7
00:00:55,761 --> 00:00:57,920
of this headless ghost mystery,

8
00:00:58,081 --> 00:00:59,081
we'll need

9
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:00,561
to have some big moves.

10
00:01:01,081 --> 00:01:03,039
I can't do the kind of hairstyle

11
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,320
used to exorcise the ghosts.

12
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,880
You can do it?

13
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:10,119
When we used to play gods,

14
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,721
he was the one doing our hairstyle.

15
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,680
Old man, what are you staring at?

16
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:31,801
Under the bright moonlight,

17
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,001
the family stays together.

18
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,441
This must be what it feels like.

19
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,840
Old man,

20
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,560
don't worry.

21
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,680
We'll make sure to get you home.

22
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:46,800
During the post-postmortem examination last time,
I made your hairpin dirty.

23
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:48,081
Here I return a new one for you.

24
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,280
Zhao Zhiting even traded

25
00:01:49,281 --> 00:01:51,361
his most precious jade pendant
to buy this for you.

26
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,280
When we experienced
severe starvation back then,

27
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:54,600
he never bear to sell it.

28
00:01:58,881 --> 00:02:01,361
Since it's for exorcising ghosts,

29
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,200
I'll hold onto it
for now on your behalf.

30
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,680
Look,

31
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,921
over there.

32
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,081
She's coming.

33
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,199
In my previous life,

34
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,280
I was the water vase in Guanyin's hand.

35
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:36,479
I descended into this world
to undergo trials

36
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,560
and vowed to complete 81 good deeds.

37
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:45,201
Now, I only have to
transcend one last wronged soul

38
00:02:45,561 --> 00:02:49,000
to return to the heavens.

39
00:02:49,241 --> 00:02:52,081
The evil spirits in the mansion
are hard to deal with.

40
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,560
So, we have invited the Vase Fairy.

41
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:55,880
It seems like

42
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,919
we've uncovered something.

43
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,599
I've already located
the wandering ghost.

44
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,481
You harmed him.

45
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,840
He doesn't want your gold.

46
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,000
He wants you to return his head.

47
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,000
Father!

48
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:12,880
Fairy, Fairy!

49
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:13,919
I beg you

50
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,319
to save our Li family.

51
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,400
The ghosts are haunting
this mansion rampantly,

52
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,160
making me couldn't sleep
the whole night.

53
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm afraid that
I couldn't live any longer.

54
00:03:21,241 --> 00:03:24,280
As long as you tell me the truth,

55
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,599
I can help you take him away.

56
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,680
How dare you!

57
00:03:29,721 --> 00:03:31,079
You fabricate lies randomly

58
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,639
slandering my Li family.

59
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,639
Fairy!

60
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,639
Fairy, your powers are boundless.

61
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,319
I beg you to stay in our mansion

62
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,400
and eliminate that evil ghost.

63
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:40,601
I beg you.

64
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:42,199
I beg you!

65
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,639
Fairy, Fairy!

66
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,000
Please save me!

67
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:49,359
The Li Mansion is so huge!

68
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,280
But they only gave us
four steamed buns per meal.

69
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,321
How is that enough?

70
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:56,801
There must be more food somewhere.

71
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,601
How dare you steal the offerings!

72
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,279
Why is it so cold all of a sudden?

73
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,880
Where's my head?

74
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,320
Head!

75
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,361
The head fell off!

76
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:39,760
Huang Santai,

77
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:42,320
give me back my head!

78
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:45,281
Give me back my head!

79
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,841
Give me back my head!

80
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:49,880
Huang Santai!

81
00:04:56,601 --> 00:04:58,079
- He has no head.
- It's okay now.

82
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,560
- Don't be scared.
- No head.

83
00:04:59,881 --> 00:05:01,241
What happened?

84
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:02,841
Baron Li...

85
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,839
Baron Li...

86
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,560
Baron Li's head is gone!

87
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:08,361
Baron Li's head is gone!

88
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,560
He's dead.

89
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,401
He's dead.

90
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:13,880
His head is gone!

91
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,241
His head...

92
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:18,921
- Wang Ling!
- Wang Ling.

93
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,961
Where have you been?

94
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,120
The head fell off!

95
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,600
Head...

96
00:05:24,601 --> 00:05:26,041
What head?

97
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,880
The head is gone.

98
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:28,920
Are you alright?

99
00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:30,000
Head...

100
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:32,601
That's too cruel.

101
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,040
What happened?

102
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,440
It's terrifying.

103
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,801
Hold on!

104
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,520
I've reported this to the authorities.

105
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,241
None of you is allowed to come near,

106
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:46,161
nor leaving here.

107
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,759
This is strange.

108
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,120
Magistrate Zhang is here.

109
00:05:50,361 --> 00:05:52,199
Can't I have some peace?

110
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,360
I had just gone out to patrol

111
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:55,120
when someone reported a murder.

112
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:00,040
His head fell off!

113
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:00,800
I...

114
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:02,759
I saw his head fell off

115
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,920
and his body ran away.

116
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:05,959
He yelled that
Huang Santai took his head.

117
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,959
I don't know.

118
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,480
I just...

119
00:06:07,481 --> 00:06:09,120
I just wanted to eat something.

120
00:06:09,121 --> 00:06:09,680
Calm down.

121
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:11,159
- I really don't know.
- Listen to me.

122
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,680
I do remember

123
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,481
that there have been rumors
that Baron Li's mansion was haunted.

124
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:16,760
Is that true?

125
00:06:16,921 --> 00:06:17,800
Yes.

126
00:06:17,801 --> 00:06:19,640
They say the headless ghost

127
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,200
is Huang Santai.

128
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,399
Are you the one
who cut off Baron Li's head?

129
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,399
I... I just ate a little something.

130
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,880
I just wanted to fill my stomach.
And his head...

131
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:29,240
Wang Ling, what else do you know?

132
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:31,120
- Calm down and think carefully.
- I don't know.

133
00:06:31,121 --> 00:06:33,360
- What was going on?
- I really don't know.

134
00:06:33,361 --> 00:06:34,760
Take the suspect away immediately.

135
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,080
This place has a negative aura.
Talking further is pointless.

136
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,079
Magistrate Zhang,
why don't you observe some more?

137
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,639
Don't be too hasty about this.

138
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,959
What's there to observe?

139
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,800
What about you taking over
as the magistrate?

140
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,880
I dare not.

141
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
- Come!
- What are you doing? He didn't kill anyone.

142
00:06:49,801 --> 00:06:51,079
I just wanted to eat something.

143
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,120
- He didn't kill anyone.
- I've never hurt anyone!

144
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,399
Wang Ling!

145
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,399
Was it you

146
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,000
who harmed Baron Li?

147
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:58,199
It wasn't me!

148
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,240
You must save me!

149
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:01,680
Please live well.

150
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:03,520
I will save you again.
