=Episode 2=

3
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:47,258
My husband...

4
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:48,378
Bad news.

5
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:49,850
Take it easy.

6
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,170
(Madam Wangqian)
My husband...

7
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,729
My husband...

8
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,210
My husband is dead because of you!

9
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:01,810
Today,

10
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:04,409
you shall join him in death!

11
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,969
You're insane!

12
00:01:07,339 --> 00:01:09,539
You conspired
with those from the theater,

13
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,858
and now you want me dead!

14
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:12,858
You will pay for this with your life!

15
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:14,209
Vile woman!

16
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,778
My husband!

17
00:01:15,779 --> 00:01:16,459
What's going on?

18
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,218
What are you doing?

19
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:18,299
- My husband!
- Stop it!

20
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:18,858
Stop!

21
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:20,899
What is this?
How could you bury a woman alive?

22
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,769
What is going on here?

23
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,170
This actress was married

24
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:26,539
to our family as a concubine
for good fortune.

25
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,890
But my husband died the next day

26
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:31,730
after meeting her.

27
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,618
Baron Wang and I

28
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:35,179
only met to discuss
the matter of purchasing

29
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,609
my freedom.

30
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,129
If I wanted him dead,

31
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,138
I would've run away.

32
00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:41,930
Cursed actress.

33
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:44,120
- You couldn't afford the payment!
- Does it matter?

34
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,530
You can't bury her alive.

35
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,899
Lady, calm down.

36
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,849
You...

37
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:50,370
Why you...

38
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,890
Watch your steps.

39
00:01:57,499 --> 00:01:58,778
The payment for my freedom.

40
00:01:58,779 --> 00:01:59,810
As for the rest,

41
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,858
I'll pay you back, plus interest.

42
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:04,209
I bet you never wanted to pay us back.

43
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:09,009
It was all just a plot
to take my husband's life!

44
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:11,969
I may be a low-born,

45
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:15,409
but I am not a murderer.

46
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,250
As for you,

47
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,689
you would have me buried
in the ground over money

48
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,930
despite the fortune you already have.

49
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:23,218
You deserve the worst death!

50
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:24,930
Watch your mouth!

51
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:31,378
We'll pay you

52
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:32,449
what she owes.

53
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,259
But she is...

54
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,610
You accuse her of murder.

55
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,129
You should inform the authority.

56
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,579
Burying her

57
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,210
would've meant committing murder.

58
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:45,050
How about this?

59
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,409
I'll pay you the money she owes you

60
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,169
for her freedom.

61
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,569
(He Wenning)
Thank you for saving me.

62
00:02:57,779 --> 00:03:00,090
I have no money to my name.

63
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:01,938
But I will work and save up money

64
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:03,930
to pay you back.

65
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:05,449
I can give you a written promise.

66
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:07,129
It was just money.

67
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,610
Don't mention it.

68
00:03:09,499 --> 00:03:10,449
Let's go.

69
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,498
Did you hear something just now?

70
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:14,218
We are investigating Deng Guang's case.

71
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:15,930
Don't get us into more trouble.

72
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,289
Deng Guang?

73
00:03:17,779 --> 00:03:19,459
I saw Baron Wang buy some medicine

74
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,770
from Deng Guang.

75
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,530
What medicine?

76
00:03:23,499 --> 00:03:25,250
Medicine meant for me.

77
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,210
Those two knew each other.

78
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,770
One is dead, the other is missing.

79
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:32,859
Are we supposed to just

80
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,689
take your word for it?

81
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,449
Watch your mouth.

82
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,370
Given the circumstances,

83
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,729
I bet you hate Baron Wang to the bones.

84
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,169
Yes.

85
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,689
I hate him.

86
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:45,370
I want him dead.

87
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,969
But what I hate more

88
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,689
is being the powerless actress

89
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,169
from the theater.

90
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:52,330
It seems

91
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:53,650
you were motivated.

92
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,739
Knock it off.

93
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,139
She is just a girl.

94
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,689
A girl is capable of killing too.

95
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,218
Taking a slap for me doesn't mean

96
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:00,810
you can slander me.

97
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,378
I am never one to harbor any grudges.

98
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,050
I settle it right on the spot.

99
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:08,370
You took a slap for me.

100
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,250
I'll pay you in double.

101
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:16,569
Since you won't believe me,

102
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,769
I'll join you in this investigation.

103
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,649
I will clear my name.

104
00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:27,610
Take the joss papers.
Use the money in afterlife.

105
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:29,529
Don't be curious of any opera.

106
00:04:30,179 --> 00:04:32,649
The dark liquid smells like herbs.

107
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:34,379
According to Deng Guang,

108
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,050
he got a divine recipe.

109
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:38,529
Did he sell it to Baron Wang?

110
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,939
Many have come to him for the medicine.

111
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,178
He made quite a fortune.

112
00:04:42,179 --> 00:04:43,730
If that's the case,

113
00:04:43,739 --> 00:04:45,649
why is his house so rundown?

114
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,250
He lost it all to gambling.

115
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:51,329
Rat!

116
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:54,370
Just a dead rat. Get it together.

117
00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:57,730
So,

118
00:04:57,739 --> 00:04:59,050
what scares you?

119
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:02,050
The mind.

120
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,939
Because you can never

121
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,329
read another's mind.

122
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,370
The fur doesn't look damaged.

123
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,689
I doubt it was burned.

124
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,850
If my guess is right,

125
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,538
it died from poisoning.

126
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:18,370
We must check Baron Wang's grave.

127
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,850
(Dried grass covers Baron Wang's grave.)

128
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:26,930
Look at this.

129
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,810
Another dead rat.

130
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,329
The rat at Deng Guang's house
was poisoned.

131
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,449
Perhaps Baron Wang was...

132
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,850
No way.

133
00:05:37,219 --> 00:05:39,019
Someone dug up the soil here.

134
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,899
Hence, the grass dried.

135
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,250
There are some new rocks in the soil.

136
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,649
In other words,

137
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,329
Baron Wang's death

138
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,850
is more than a mystery.

139
00:05:47,859 --> 00:05:49,050
What now?

140
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:50,899
If Inquisitor Song was here,

141
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,490
he'd examine the body again

142
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:54,769
to uncover the truth.

143
00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:57,649
Are you out of your mind?

144
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,569
Where is the old gentleman?

145
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,230
(The late mother Zhao De)

146
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:09,569
It's not him.

147
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,730
It's our peers.

148
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:16,569
You could tell from that?

149
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:19,899
Did they not wash the paint

150
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,209
off their bodies?

151
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,298
They were wearing opera costumes

152
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,569
inside.

153
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,930
What would one come to a grave
so late at night?

154
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,410
To perform a funerary opera?

155
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,970
Oh no.

156
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:32,209
The old man is in danger.

157
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,410
Zhao Zhiting.

158
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:42,009
Solving mysteries is just a hobby.

159
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,778
Your main job is a playwright.

160
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,098
There's no need to risk your life

161
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:46,689
for a hobby.

162
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,370
Someone's here!

163
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:51,449
A ghost!

164
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:57,930
You two, get it together!

165
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,209
You see what you fear.

166
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:03,529
You've never

167
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:04,939
committed heinous crimes.

168
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,170
No need to be afraid.

169
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:08,170
I'm afraid you could get us killed.

170
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,689
You know,

171
00:07:09,739 --> 00:07:11,329
we started out in the troupe,

172
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,449
but

173
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,619
we've never sung.

174
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,769
What?

175
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:23,290
Even the Yellow River

176
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:27,129
becomes clear.

177
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,689
How can anyone
never met any good fortune?

178
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,649
- Help!
- Help!

179
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,689
- Help!
- Help!

180
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,290
Help!

181
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:05,979
(Tomb of...)
The living don't meddle with the dead,

182
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,610
The living don't meddle with the dead,

183
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:14,410
not unless they seek horror.
