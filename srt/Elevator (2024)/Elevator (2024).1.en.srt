1
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:29,571
Like them,
I'm here for the money.

2
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:30,864
For the dollars.

3
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,907
More income.

4
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,952
I am also here to change my destiny.

5
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:41,082
I'm tired of being an employee.
It's time to be the boss.

6
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,960
Push, fight, work hard.

7
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,046
I will not stop until I change my life.

8
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:51,092
This guy plays big all the time.
We have a shot with him.

9
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,219
Although our origins are different…

10
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,137
Not this one.

11
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,681
…we want the same destination.

12
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,976
In this fight, they are my allies.

13
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,854
Do not worry. I got this.

14
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:05,648
Inside my elevator, I am the captain.

15
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,484
I will make them bet on us.

16
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,861
Also, this is our last year together.

17
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,529
Our contracts are almost up.

18
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,031
So let's make this count.

19
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:16,743
Let's get out of this basement
and let us change our lives!

20
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,119
Let's go!

21
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:21,498
I said it in English
so my friends can understand it.

22
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:26,377
Migrant workers are forced to
leave their home country to sacrifice…

23
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,630
to help and support… their sacrifice…

24
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,632
Migrant workers are connected.

25
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:33,218
With my app, Global Gigs, we…

26
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:37,597
Those apps you use,
it also started with someone like me.

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,182
Someone took a risk with them.

28
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,644
By the way sir, I heard
you are into investing in…

29
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:46,773
And as the big shots went in and out,
and up and down on my elevator…

30
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,942
By the way, sir, I've heard that…

31
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,277
I only need one of them to risk on me.

32
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,864
Maybe the next time you click something,
you'll be using my app.

33
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,408
Sir, if your factories are with Good Job…

34
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,577
You're working hard!

35
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,954
Time to breathe.

36
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,876
It was bad.
We almost gave up hope.

37
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,048
What do you think?
What do… What do you think?

38
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,675
But, of course, we can't stop.

39
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,344
Take a little breath.
The fight continues…

40
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,847
until the end.

41
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,056
Wait, how…

42
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,017
How did you know that I'm expanding?

43
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:26,062
I read it on Mogul Monthly, sir.

44
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,648
Also, sir, if you invest in this app,

45
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,485
this can be a direct hiring tool
for your growing HR needs.

46
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,327
You know what?

47
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,788
I would like to learn more.

48
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,624
-Jar…
-Jared, sir.

49
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,585
Jared, that's what I thought.

50
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,420
So why don't you…

51
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,506
send me your proposal.

52
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,591
All right?

53
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,344
Thank you, sir.

54
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,808
We did it, boys!

55
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,853
Yes!

56
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,064
But we haven't won yet.

57
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,357
It's just the beginning.

58
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,525
Is he still playing?

59
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,569
Yes, bro. He's betting big.

60
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,584
Good morning, sir.

61
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:32,587
I'm sorry, sir,
I'm waiting on maintenance.

62
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,756
Wow!

63
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:35,965
Not for me!

64
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,133
Not today.

65
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,552
Kindly use the other elevator, please.

66
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,387
-Thank you,
-I apologize, sir.

67
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,646
He's cashed out, bro.

68
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,649
Senin, are you on him, bro?

69
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,816
Headed to you.

70
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,610
And he looks happy.

71
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,446
Right this way, Sir Byron.

72
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,406
Good morning, Sir Byron.

73
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,242
-How's it going?
-Looks like you won.

74
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,534
I always do.

75
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,496
Penthouse, sir?

76
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,747
Yeah.

77
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,920
By the way, sir, I'm happy to announce

78
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:17,215
that I've widened my network
of potential employers to include

79
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:22,053
Saudi, Hong Kong, Canada,
and also here in Singapore.

80
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,391
Singapore, I understand
because you're here, but…

81
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,310
how'd you manage
to swing the other countries?

82
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,730
Sir, my previous co-workers and friends
from Qatar and Taiwan

83
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,899
have been scattered all over the world.

84
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,484
It's through them that I'm able

85
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,487
to reach and add migrant workers
to my database,

86
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,364
even if I'm just here in Singapore.

87
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:46,995
Which improves my job search
and listing for my Good Job app,

88
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:51,457
making it even easier for migrant workers
to connect with their potential employers.

89
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,962
Good Job?
That's what you're calling it now?

90
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,801
Yes, sir. But if you still want…

91
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,888
If you still want Global Gigs,
we can still use that.

92
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:06,973
No.

93
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,808
Good Job, it's got a…

94
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,476
It's got a nice ring to it.

95
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,561
Thank you, sir.

96
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,231
Sir, I think the work I've done
is already okay.

97
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:19,694
Maybe I can set a formal pitch with you
so we can finalize your investment.

98
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:26,326
This is what I like about you.
Always straight to the point.

99
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:30,663
I have to because I think
I only have ten seconds left with you.

100
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:34,167
No need to rush.
I'm going to be staying here for a month.

101
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,629
And Bettina will be joining me shortly.
Her flight just got delayed.

102
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,631
But once she gets here,

103
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,676
I want you two to get together

104
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,305
and further refine your app
and your business proposal. Okay?

105
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,725
Sir? Bettina?

106
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,352
She's my executive assistant.

107
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:59,484
Sir, I've already done all the revisions
based on your last email.

108
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,694
No. I don't want to be wasting my time

109
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,281
on a piece of work that's just "okay".
Okay?

110
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:09,619
And Bettina can help you turn
what you have into something perfect.

111
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:13,623
This is big business, Jared. And,

112
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:19,253
you know, I'm gonna be investing
big money into you and your app.

113
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,797
Gotta be sure.

114
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,760
But there's always a price to pay.

115
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,929
Of course, I'm not stupid.

116
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:33,851
Okay, sir. I will do my best
to work with her and do what you want.

117
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:34,977
Good.

118
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,813
Just be patient, all right?

119
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:40,316
And pretty soon, you just
might have your own business.

120
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,736
Maybe you can say goodbye to all this.

121
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,908
Thank you again, Sir Byron.

122
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,216
Here you go, Ma'am Bettina.
You can leave your luggage here.

123
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,300
Thank you.

124
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,894
Son of a bitch!

125
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,230
You are Filipino?

126
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,486
Are you the elevator boy?

127
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,911
Penthouse, please.

128
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,922
Bettina Enriquez, Sir Byron's EA.

129
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,757
He's going to be busy.

130
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:50,052
Just send me what you have
and I'll look over everything tonight.

131
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,223
All right, Ma'am Bettina.

132
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:58,144
I followed everything
in the email sent to me.

133
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,188
How about your free remittance?

134
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,981
Have you removed it?

135
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,276
Ma'am,

136
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:09,363
that's an incentive
for migrant workers to sign up with us.

137
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,116
Besides, that's a big help to them.

138
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,245
This is not a charity.

139
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,211
Just send me what you have.

140
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,505
I'll look over everything by tonight.

141
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,509
Pork sisig.

142
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,552
-It's your favorite.
-Bless you.

143
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,430
-Can I have your…
-Kimchi?

144
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,140
-Kimchi. Go ahead.
-Kimchi. Yes.

145
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,017
-I'll put it here?
-No. This one.

146
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,310
This one?

147
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,978
This is awesome, guys.

148
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,522
Bettina? Sexy.

149
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,024
I don't get it, bro.

150
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,068
You've worked on this for the past year.

151
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,528
Why do we need her?

152
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,487
Yes.

153
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,489
Maybe Byron's just leading you on.

154
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,532
Easy, guys.

155
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:56,077
Maybe she's a test to see
if I can really pull off this app.

156
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,871
I know it's a hassle, but I'm not worried.

157
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,207
I've already impressed her boss.

158
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,584
So, whatever she throws at me,

159
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,253
I got this, bros.

160
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,381
When we have our company,

161
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,217
I can visit my girlfriend more often.

162
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,427
I can propose to mine.

163
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,888
And I'll be able to marry my fiancée.

164
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,349
I just want to go home to my girlfriend.

165
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:22,270
And you're all gonna see me
dating the finest females, bros.

166
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,771
Ikmal!

167
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,356
Jared, I'll need a wingman.

168
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,858
You and me. Las Vegas chicks.

169
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:28,943
No.

170
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:32,154
Once the app is running,
I will focus on making it bigger.

171
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,282
And love, that's not important.

172
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,703
Emotional damage!

173
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,371
No, no, no.

174
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,623
Why aren't you back at your posts yet?

175
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,835
Sir, we still have ten minutes to eat.

176
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,629
No. It will take you
ten minutes to clean this up…

177
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,590
and get back to the front desk.

178
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,467
And you! Stop smiling!
You were late this morning!

179
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,469
I requested for a late shift today.

180
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,888
I was driving for the guest
until midnight.

181
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,308
And it was denied! So you are late!

182
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,938
Okay, yes, we will work right away, sir.

183
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,982
We'll work all the time, yes.

184
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,988
You see, guys?
This is what I'm talking about.

185
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:19,160
Like you guys, I've also been in love
before, but I've never been my own boss.

186
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,299
She still there, bro?

187
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,887
Sorry, bro, she's still at it.

188
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,680
Fucking shit.

189
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,022
Good morning, Ma'am Bettina.

190
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,106
Maybe…

191
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,361
Maybe you can…

192
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,573
Maybe we can…

193
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,873
Maybe we can talk now?

194
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,627
Later.

195
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,005
Bitch.

196
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,883
It's only 55 seconds
from ground floor to penthouse.

197
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,551
You were able to convince Byron.

198
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,262
What more now that
you and Bettina have one month?

199
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,472
It will work out.

200
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,559
All right.

201
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,852
Game, come on.

202
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,688
If I'm as sexy as her,
I won't work much as well.

203
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:30,856
Silly.

204
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,777
Good morning again, Ma'am Bettina.

205
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,445
-Shall we talk, Ma'am?
-Nope.

206
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,155
Why not?

207
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:39,698
Busy.

208
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:40,866
With?

209
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,203
Good morning. Good morning.

210
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,455
-What floor, please?
-Going up?

211
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,790
-Fifth?
-Fifth.

212
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,547
Meeting.

213
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,298
When?

214
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,926
Just wait.

215
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,098
Excuse me.

216
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,687
Hello again, Ma'am Bettina.

217
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,149
If you're free, ma'am, maybe…

218
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,317
you can give my app a chance.

219
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,237
Okay, I mean, come in, please.

220
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,321
Come in, ma'am.

221
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,419
She's always at the gym, damn it.

222
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,254
It's like a vacation for her.

223
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,505
Relax.

224
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,300
You still have lots of time.

225
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,677
No matter how long they stay here,

226
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,055
if she's always avoiding me,
nothing will come of it.

227
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,811
What about Sir Byron?
Do we know where he is?

228
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,605
He left with a different driver.

229
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,899
But he made dinner reservations later.

230
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,025
Later?

231
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,611
Time to approach him directly.

232
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,739
She can't avoid me if Sir Byron is there.

233
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:07,286
How could you undervalue
her accounts in India?

234
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,624
I'm sorry, sir. Their partner
just had an infusion of new capital…

235
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,501
She lorded it over, Bettina!

236
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,962
That's 100 million that should be
divided between Alice and me.

237
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,631
And now, I can't do shit!

238
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:22,510
Stop making me look like a fool
and do your job!

239
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,136
Elevator going up.

240
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,221
Anyone?

241
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,224
Do it now!

242
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:53,499
A bitch and a hag. She's just beautiful.

243
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:57,169
I didn't expect
that my impression of her would be wrong.

244
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,718
Let me do it, ma'am.

245
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,639
Don't move. Stay still.

246
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:09,723
There.

247
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,017
Thank you.

248
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,107
Sorry.

249
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,443
What for?

250
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:26,156
Finally. I got two words from you, ma'am.

251
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,661
Is it okay if…

252
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,084
You're so annoying.

253
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,588
That's why I'm saying sorry, ma'am.

254
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:44,216
I know you have a lot of problems,
and I'm adding into it.

255
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,927
But I promise, I won't bother you anymore.

256
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,683
I'm sorry, too.
I didn't even talk to you properly.

257
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:54,768
It's fine, ma'am.

258
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,396
Maybe just focus on your work.

259
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,440
Then when you're ready,

260
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,442
I'll be in the elevator.

261
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,950
In a few days, I will be free.

262
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,333
Wow. Your schedule is really full.

263
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,543
Good thing you still have time to relax.

264
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,046
I like this, too.

265
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,425
The busier you are means

266
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,178
you are more important
in your company, isn't it?

267
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:35,017
But, ma'am, of course
it's still important to relax sometimes.

268
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,897
And, yes, ma'am,
instead of smoking, just stay here.

269
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,484
Because no one will bother you,
no one will find you,

270
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,944
the signal's weak here.

271
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,529
That's the magic of my elevator.

272
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,408
It only goes up and down,
you don't have to think.

273
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:56,872
Wait, ma'am. I learned something from
my colleague here. Just imitate me.

274
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,549
Ma'am, try it. There is nothing to lose.

275
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,527
Good morning, ma'am.

276
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,654
Are they a hassle?

277
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:29,738
Slightly.

278
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,035
Still fighting?

279
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,329
Still fighting.

280
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:40,958
Hey, ma'am.

281
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,960
Ma'am, you bounced back?

282
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,587
Tremendously.

283
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,215
Your app's next.

284
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,182
Nice play on Bettina.

285
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,685
Easing up on her was the right move.

286
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,856
Believe it or not, boys,

287
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,482
it was not a play.

288
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,610
Wait, what? I thought
you said she was the enemy?

289
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,696
Nothing more than the boss's chick?

290
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,739
A bitch!

291
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,157
-Hey!
-Go easy.

292
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,702
Yeah, but maybe I was wrong.

293
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,873
Because I overheard her
with her co-workers,

294
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,668
and she also has problems,
she has a job to do,

295
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,837
and she has a boss to answer to.

296
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,630
Just like us.

297
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:32,718
And maybe, like us,
she needs help from time to time.

298
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,346
That's what our app is for, right?

299
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,473
Yeah

300
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,225
Oh, my.

301
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,478
Good morning, Ma'am Bettina!

302
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,354
Good morning, Ma'am Bettina.

303
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,564
Relax, guys.

304
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,024
Just call me Bettina.

305
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,068
I am Jeoneun Ji-ho.

306
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,195
I am Amir.

307
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,991
I am Senin.

308
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,910
Hello! I'm Panying!

309
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,536
I'm Ikmal.

310
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:00,954
Pleasure to meet you.

311
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,623
No kiss.

312
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:09,421
I've read your names
in Jared's business proposal.

313
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,341
It's nice to meet the future
country reps of the app.

314
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,842
Country reps?

315
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,594
I like the sound of that.

316
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:20,599
We're not there yet.
Still lots of work needs to be done.

317
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,563
Your sub said you're off.
Are you ready to work?

318
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,319
Yeah. Give me five minutes.
I'll just change clothes.

319
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,823
-It's near, we'll just turn right…
-Near?

320
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:39,409
Wait. Yes, you're the new guy.

321
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,954
-You're Jared from Manila.
-Manila.

322
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,122
-And…
-Sawadee.

323
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,290
-Billy from Thailand?
-Yes.

324
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,834
I will teach you a hack.

325
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,502
When your legs are hurting,

326
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,255
you put up your arms
like this and you stretch.

327
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,798
-This?
-You'll feel it here.

328
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,466
Yes. It feels good.

329
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,510
But don't do it when there are people.

330
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,554
Yes. Thank you for the tip.

331
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,013
Thank you.

332
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,933
Let's go. Come.

333
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,143
Wow!

334
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,479
Hello. Whoa!

335
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,525
Are you a working girl? How much are you?

336
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,034
I am.

337
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,830
But you can't afford me.

338
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,623
Why did you say yes?

339
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,167
And he can, right?

340
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,253
Because he's dressed like trash. Sorry.

341
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,963
I'm better looking than you.

342
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,757
It's not the suit that makes the man,

343
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,801
but the man wearing it.

344
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,345
And this guy

345
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:44,474
is the CEO of a tech start-up,

346
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,895
and he is worth billions.

347
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,773
He's way sexier than you, too.

348
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,026
Thank you again for the 5,000 tip, sir.

349
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,819
Hope to serve you again.

350
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,407
Okay, I will double it next time.

351
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,996
Thank you.

352
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,374
I just realized why Bettina did that.

353
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,044
So if I didn't break him,

354
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,213
played with him a little,

355
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,883
he'll just move on to the next girl
that steps into the door.

356
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,927
But for now,

357
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,471
if he thought I was for sale,

358
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,640
then he can't buy me,

359
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,476
I'll let him know that his money

360
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,853
doesn't make him any special.

361
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,814
So he shouldn't be an asshole.

362
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,317
From the looks of that asshole…

363
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,403
You just didn't break him,
you even shook his world.

364
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,740
Your friend helped too.

365
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,784
5K tip?

366
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,702
You're a big shot.

367
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:46,995
Oh, ma'am.

368
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,747
I hope it's real.

369
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,375
Let's make it real.

370
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,794
So, do you believe in me?

371
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,046
In your app?

372
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,881
I always have.

373
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,842
That's why I answer your emails, right?

374
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:06,848
Wait, so you're the one I'm emailing,
and not Sir Byron?

375
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,433
It's part of my job.

376
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,644
That's why I'm familiar with your app.

377
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:11,561
That's why.

378
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,813
I know its potential.

379
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,607
Then why did you give me a hard time?

380
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,943
I was busy.

381
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,945
And to be honest,

382
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,323
with you, I am not sure.

383
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,326
I mean, what should I think?

384
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,830
He said he was interested
in the app of an elevator attendant.

385
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:33,041
That he was still a little drunk
when he met you.

386
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,835
How would I know if…

387
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,461
you're a scammer

388
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,963
or con artist.

389
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,257
And you're just deceiving him.

390
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,676
You have a point.

391
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:44,928
What about now?

392
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,305
Do you believe in me?

393
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:52,394
God, we still have lots to do.

394
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,939
Your remittance partner
in the Philippines,

395
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,899
this Kate Dizon,

396
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:01,278
-did you talk to her directly?
-Yeah.

397
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,697
My issue, they can suddenly change rates

398
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,450
and if we don't have back-up,
we'll be stuck.

399
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,535
No. I trust Kate.

400
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,914
Why are you so confident in Kate?

401
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,795
She's my friend. My classmate in college.

402
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,842
She is a nice friend.

403
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,969
You don't have an investor yet.

404
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,305
She's already supportive of your app.

405
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,933
Does she have a cut?

406
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,771
No, she doesn't. Because…

407
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,565
this was our thesis
when we were in college.

408
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,650
First, just a classmate.

409
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,195
Now, you did a thesis together?

410
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,198
Who is she really to you?

411
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,202
For the sake of our working relationship,

412
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,621
you have to be honest with me.

413
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,083
Especially when she will be
involved in our app.

414
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,544
Ma'am.

415
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,339
She's also my ex.

416
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,386
Ex?

417
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,680
Is that all?

418
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:16,144
If you have no conflict of interest,
you have nothing to hide.

419
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,522
Unless…

420
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,316
you still have feelings for her.

421
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,778
-Was it a bad breakup?
-It's not like that. Kate's kind.

422
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,322
Mom and Dad actually really liked her.

423
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,157
A model Filipina.

424
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,077
Why did you break up?

425
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,703
After we graduated,

426
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,248
she entered that company.

427
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:40,210
As for me, I'm in a start-up
Bitcoin company in Qatar.

428
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,797
We tried to have
a long distance relationship but…

429
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,715
we didn't last long, either.

430
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,260
When I returned to the Philippines,

431
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,053
Kate has a boyfriend.

432
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:54,891
But I wasn't surprised because
we had been apart for a long time.

433
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,017
Shit.

434
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,727
Sorry, Jared.

435
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:58,937
That's fine, ma'am.

436
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,814
It's been a long time, and…

437
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,692
it was a mutual decision.

438
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,862
Maybe life is just like that.

439
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,446
She got lucky.

440
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,532
I was not fortunate.

441
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,409
Even so, ma'am…

442
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,245
I still won't stop

443
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:19,291
-looking for gold! Sheesh!
-Sheesh!

444
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,626
-You know that too, ma'am?
-Of course!

445
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,171
It's also my sister's favorite.

446
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,341
No, seriously, ma'am.

447
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,595
I was not lucky then.

448
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,681
But I haven't lost yet.

449
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,852
You are an IT grad.

450
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,396
Why didn't you just stay in Manila?

451
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:46,359
If I stayed there, I will just be an
employee for the rest of my life.

452
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:50,071
Besides, I already got
a taste for dollars.

453
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:54,159
I'm the same. I get that, too.

454
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,369
But here?

455
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,205
Why be an elevator boy?

456
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,459
Ma'am, trial and error.

457
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,338
In Taiwan, I was also in IT.

458
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:09,674
I had a lot of time,
I had a lot of contacts.

459
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,760
No one around me has money.

460
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,596
Hello, sir, let me tell you about the…

461
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,806
When I came here,
there was a lot of money,

462
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,850
but I don't have time with them.

463
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,519
Even if I had the time with them,

464
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,812
it was difficult.

465
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,564
Let me tell you about…

466
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,781
That's too much.

467
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,784
There are easier ways
to get investments, you know?

468
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,369
For someone like me?

469
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:40,497
You know, in our case,
if you don't have the right last name,

470
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,208
if you're not rich,
you're really at a disadvantage.

471
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:47,003
But here, ma'am, I have a chance.

472
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:51,383
I just need talent, I just need timing.

473
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,011
Even if there's an opening
in another department,

474
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,472
I fought to be assigned to the elevator.

475
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:58,765
It's worth it.

476
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,685
This is where I met you.

477
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,853
You and Sir Byron.

478
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,404
She's cool. We laughed a lot.

479
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,281
She's a great person to talk to.

480
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:17,284
I didn't expect her
to become like a friend to me.

481
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,786
I was gonna text her but…

482
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,037
Jared.

483
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,333
Using your phone on the job.
Isn't that against the rules?

484
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,836
I'm sorry, sir.
I was messaging Ma'am Bettina.

485
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,629
We were fixing our schedule.

486
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,881
Relax, I'm just messing with you.

487
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:35,135
Speaking of Bettina, she said
you two are getting along well

488
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,053
and making progress.

489
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,514
Yes, sir. Thank you.

490
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:41,099
Are you going to the gym?

491
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,726
No, not yet.

492
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,686
Let's go to the ground floor.

493
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,396
I wanna show you something.

494
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,732
But, sir, I cannot…

495
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,942
I'm on duty. I cannot leave my post.

496
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,360
No, relax.

497
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,611
I know the owner.

498
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,405
I got you covered.

499
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,368
Get your hands off me, man.

500
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,454
I'm a VIP here. What the fuck?

501
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,496
Sorry.

502
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,539
I'm sorry, sir.

503
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:05,623
As I've said,

504
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,835
there's been a case
of sexual misconduct against you.

505
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,211
Come on.

506
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,631
We've reviewed the footage
and we've confirmed it.

507
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,926
We're now giving you
a chance to leave peacefully

508
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,221
or face legal action from the hotel
and the said guest.

509
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,435
-It's you! Hey!
-Showtime.

510
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:28,730
-You fucking rat! Fuck you!
-No!

511
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,315
Woah, big guy.

512
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,775
Listen.

513
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,868
I understand, sir.

514
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,037
I'm sorry about that.

515
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:59,677
Bettina told me
about your incident with him yesterday.

516
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:03,014
She said you wanted to punch him, huh?

517
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:07,644
So I figured you'd like to see him
get what he deserves.

518
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,772
Thank you for having my back, sir.

519
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,818
If you don't mind, sir,
what did you tell him?

520
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,237
That I bought his company,

521
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,448
and that if he didn't want me
to sell it piece by piece,

522
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,910
he should just shut the fuck up
and get the hell out.

523
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:28,289
Thank you for trying
to defend Bettina, huh?

524
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,960
She was able to take care of herself, sir.

525
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,753
That's my girl.

526
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:38,967
And she is my girl,
so I couldn't let this slide.

527
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,638
Are you ready?

528
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,056
Are you finished?

529
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:46,808
Not yet.

530
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:49,227
What time?

531
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,729
I'm still preparing.

532
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,606
As I said, I'm not stupid.

533
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,569
After what just happened, I think
it's better to stay away for a bit.

534
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,488
Sorry, I'm just tired.

535
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:01,614
Besides…

536
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,701
I'm just coding, right?

537
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,286
You're doing the business plan.

538
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:09,205
So maybe we just do our tasks separately.

539
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,836
Are you avoiding me?

540
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,547
Shit. Can she read my mind?

541
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,090
No. Well…

542
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,468
I'm just tired and…

543
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,678
Anyway, I just do the coding.

544
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,180
You have the business side.

545
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,765
Maybe we do tasks separately.

546
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,933
No, we are better together.

547
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,852
We cannot be complacent.

548
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,605
We're not the only ones
lined up for an investment.

549
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:36,274
That's why I've set up
this very important meeting

550
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,359
so we can add value to the app.

551
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:43,531
Well, Panying
and I have to go somewhere later.

552
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,368
But that's not for fun.
That's also for our app.

553
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:53,291
As the founder, I need you
to be part of my meeting.

554
00:29:54,167 --> 00:30:00,089
And as my partner, I need to know who else
you are involving in this app.

555
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,509
Do you still not trust me?

556
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:05,053
But when she's the one who asks,

557
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,306
when she looks at you
and tells you things like these,

558
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,725
how can I refuse?

559
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:14,312
Of course I do.

560
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,818
Sorry.

561
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:23,363
I need to focus on the app.

562
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:29,452
I mean, focus. Okay, focus.
Focus on our goal.

563
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,219
Which floor, sir?

564
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,470
I knew it.

565
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,055
-Yes.
-From the hotel, right?

566
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,598
Yes, Dr. Revee.

567
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,225
It's nice to see you again.

568
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,643
It's Reve.

569
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,186
Yes, Dr. Revee.

570
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,605
I pitched to him in the elevator before.

571
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,732
Okay.

572
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,151
The work app, right?
What was it called again?

573
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,112
It's now called Good Job,

574
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:07,198
and we at Top Logistics
are backing Jared's start up.

575
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,117
Does Byron know about this move?

576
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:12,245
The app doesn't seem to fit your profile.

577
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:15,790
I share your concern, Dr. Revee,
but only at first.

578
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:19,419
I was skeptical when Byron presented
the idea of Jared's app,

579
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:23,923
but diving into it more and getting
to know the man behind it even better,

580
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:27,719
I can confidently say that you
missed out on a big opportunity

581
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,721
when you didn't take up Jared's offer.

582
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,765
It's nice to hear
that she somehow looks up to me.

583
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,976
That's high praise
coming from you, Bettina.

584
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,769
I am recalling what you said,

585
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:40,940
that this app is nothing more
than a job listing for your cell phone.

586
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,151
Nothing new, nothing special.

587
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,403
On the surface, yes.

588
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:49,949
But with Jared as a migrant worker himself
as the beating heart of the app,

589
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,368
we are fostering more than just a network,

590
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:55,747
but a community of
like-minded, driven employees

591
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,832
for each of our client partners.

592
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,253
If you're talking about loyalty
and keeping my workers in line,

593
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,713
I can cultivate that myself.

594
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:06,674
Yes, but with Good Job,
we can cultivate that for you.

595
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,135
With our thrust for
peer-to-peer recommendation,

596
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,846
each employee is already
vouched for by an existing one.

597
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,182
And with this personal
connections in place.

598
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,308
A better, safer…

599
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:19,187
And as I listen to her,
the more I look up to her as well.

600
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:23,274
Dr. Revee, as our client,
covered 30 percent of your overhead.

601
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,902
I'm sure Byron
will be more enticed to fund us.

602
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,445
This is a big deal.

603
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,906
But why don't you seem as happy as I am?

604
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,700
Are we far enough?

605
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,785
Yeah.

606
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,877
Good job on targeting him before
as an investor.

607
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,754
What good did I do?

608
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,339
You convinced him.

609
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,883
What are you saying?
But you're still right.

610
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:52,095
You just didn't see an angle,
but that comes with experience.

611
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,347
And lots and lots of confidence.

612
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,557
Your toe-to-toe against him was great.

613
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,643
Every move, you have a response.

614
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:03,523
If it's just confidence,
I feel like I can give it to you.

615
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,113
We have time before we meet Panying.

616
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,245
Let's go?

617
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:34,804
Why did you drag me here?
I'm bad at singing.

618
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,559
Don't be shy, I'm bad too.

619
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,060
It's just for fun.

620
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,895
Don't worry, we're pretty.

621
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:44,647
Relax!

622
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,649
Ready? What now?

623
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,026
Let's go!

624
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:49,819
Ready!

625
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:53,448
Every day, just hard work

626
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,491
Let them

627
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,493
Stand in your way

628
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,538
Just keep going

629
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:04,500
Just go straight
Even if there is someone blocking it

630
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,087
Straight ahead, plan

631
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,844
Parents, friends are my support
They are…

632
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,804
Why don't I stop?

633
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,806
There's no stopping in looking for gold!

634
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,808
Sheesh!

635
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:24,520
Every day, just hard work

636
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:27,982
Let them stand in your way

637
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:31,611
Don't stop, just keep going

638
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:35,531
Just go straight
Even if there is someone blocking it

639
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,598
And it's not just for Filipinos, Elvis.

640
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:04,477
Even your foreign co-workers on the ship,
they can also use my app.

641
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,561
Yes!

642
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,939
Then when you land in a country,

643
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,733
you can also offer this
to bars or restaurants.

644
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,985
And because you guys are my friends,

645
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,780
you get a commission
for referral registrations.

646
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:18,699
-Wow!
-This friend of yours is really cool.

647
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,785
Big shot! Boss moves!

648
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,498
I remember when you were
talking about it in Taiwan,

649
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,375
I thought you were just drunk.

650
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:32,255
But here you are,
you're already doing it.

651
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,051
I didn't make a mistake
in recommending him.

652
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:40,972
I was surprised
when you told me to watch over him.

653
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,557
He's so annoying.

654
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,434
-What about now?
-But, he's kind.

655
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,769
He always helps.

656
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,312
He always obeys me.

657
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:53,359
I don't know if I should be happy
or irritated by what you're saying.

658
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,111
Well, yeah.

659
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,571
This is the last round.

660
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,322
-Go.
-Go.

661
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,448
You still have time?

662
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,700
We have one more song.

663
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,036
I'll just finish this beer.

664
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,205
Okay.

665
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,082
Okay.

666
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,877
Really? Another one?

667
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:12,503
Really?

668
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,629
It's okay.

669
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,299
Really?

670
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,594
What happened to what you said
about avoiding her?

671
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:25,683
What happened?
I had meetings with her.

672
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,810
-Really?
-Yes.

673
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,104
I'll tell you something.

674
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,689
You know what this is?

675
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,399
It's okay with me.

676
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,483
Because…

677
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,402
we've been here for so long…

678
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,321
and I never saw you like this.

679
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,407
What?

680
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:45,620
What do you mean?
We always drink like this.

681
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,246
Not literally, silly.

682
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:48,748
Calm.

683
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,000
Not in a hurry.

684
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,419
Smiling like a fool.

685
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,719
I've never seen you happy like this.

686
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,804
Enjoy it.

687
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,139
Have fun.

688
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:18,319
You have been added to Tropang Paris,

689
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,739
Dabarkads London, Milan, Manila.

690
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:25,618
Wow! My friend Elvis is so fast.

691
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:29,705
I already told you.
You have instincts for this.

692
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:33,000
That's thinking like a real businessman.

693
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:36,837
You know I got that from…

694
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,675
Wait, I'm thinking.

695
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,594
Hi, I'm Jared.

696
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:46,305
Have you considered being your own boss?

697
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,558
I am part of a wide network
of entrepreneurs

698
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:52,436
who have unlocked the secret of success.

699
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,105
Is this a pyramid scheme?

700
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,982
Ma'am, ours is not a scam.

701
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,234
I am telling the truth.

702
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:03,072
You know, with your tenacity,
I'm sure you can sell a lot.

703
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:08,119
Back to back recruiter of the month. Yes!

704
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:13,165
But for real, ma'am,

705
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:16,294
the reason why I made this app is because…

706
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,172
because of my friend Elvis.

707
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,425
For Panying, and the guys, too.

708
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:26,053
They are always there for me.

709
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,973
They're always ready catch me.

710
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,522
I can understand now
why your app is like that.

711
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,401
The workers come first.

712
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,695
That's who you are.

713
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,365
You really care.

714
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,160
You care a lot.

715
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,874
Our life is difficult.

716
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,628
All of us are looking for allies.

717
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:05,468
We can give that to them,
then we will earn more and then…

718
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,219
everyone wins.

719
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,376
Hey.

720
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,545
You're not allowed
to fall in love with me.

721
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,548
No, ma'am, it's not like that.

722
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,758
It's because…

723
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:50,221
I'm used to seeing you wearing
office wear all the time.

724
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:53,557
It's the first time
I've seen you like that.

725
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:59,397
Byron requested that
I wear my best clothes.

726
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,564
So here.

727
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:05,194
We're going out
with his high school friends later.

728
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,571
What's wrong with them?

729
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,365
Nothing.

730
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:10,741
They're arrogant.

731
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,118
All they do is flex.

732
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,536
Ego contest.

733
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,704
You know, guy stuff.

734
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,332
And Byron can't help himself.

735
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,167
Keeping up with them, too.

736
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:25,464
But maybe, I could still
pitch to them to invest.

737
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:29,677
That's what I like, ma'am. You can do it.

738
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:37,935
Hello?

739
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,728
You're early.

740
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,150
What happened?

741
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,116
Bettina, whatever it is…

742
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,579
We can talk. We can fix it.

743
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:01,208
Good thing, I'm off now.
Do you want to talk about it downstairs?

744
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,450
Thank you.

745
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,453
I'm sorry.

746
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,106
What the fuck did I do?

747
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,614
All right, let's get this sorted.

748
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,284
Hong Kong. We need to know
about that cargo suppliers…

749
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,203
Quick concise update.
Line up interviews for new hires.

750
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,080
Accounting department needs it ASAP.

751
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:05,291
The assets for Byron's meeting with Alice.

752
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,001
Double check with the girls.

753
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:10,045
Every detail. Every document.
And that damn app.

754
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,922
Why is he looking at me?

755
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,758
Son of a bitch!

756
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,677
You're Filipino?

757
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,684
You're the elevator boy?

758
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:25,728
You weren't kidding.

759
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,938
He really is the elevator boy.

760
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,150
Does it matter? I mean,

761
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,736
his app is promising.

762
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,780
Even you liked it the first time
I told you about it.

763
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:41,035
It still needs a lot of work.
But the app itself is fine.

764
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:45,497
It's just Jared that I'm uneasy with.

765
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,333
He just seems so…

766
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,168
young.

767
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:51,378
Inexperienced.

768
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,547
I don't think I can work with him.

769
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,842
Well, you better find a way

770
00:43:57,509 --> 00:44:01,972
because you really want your own
department to handle in the company,

771
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:07,144
developing this app
and making it work for us,

772
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:09,480
that's your test.

773
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,983
And that is the deal
that you made with me.

774
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,611
I can't expect this to happen now.

775
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:19,073
Especially when you have
so much on the line also.

776
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:27,790
I'd rather focus on my efforts
n finalizing your divorce.

777
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,709
Listen. Just give me
the information I asked for.

778
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:33,045
I can handle Alice just fine.

779
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,218
What? You don't believe me?

780
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:45,057
All this back and forth
has been going on for years. And…

781
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,393
That's why we're staying here so long.

782
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,979
Listen. I'm not gonna leave Singapore
until we split the company

783
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,981
between Alice and me. All right?

784
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,943
And just like you,
I want this over and done with.

785
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,027
Okay?

786
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:02,032
Regardless, I have never
let my personal issues with Alice

787
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,243
get in the way of business.

788
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,120
All right?

789
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:10,624
So, be a pro, do your job,
and make it work with Jared.

790
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:12,835
All right?

791
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,338
I hate it when he does that.

792
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:19,299
And that.

793
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:41,530
But it's not as if I have a choice.

794
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,449
Just work, Bettina.

795
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,161
Just clear your mind.

796
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:49,079
Ignore everything.

797
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,498
Just focus on what you have to do.

798
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,125
Focus.

799
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,226
You should have prepared this earlier.

800
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,854
-We just got the projector.
-Sorry, Sir Byron.

801
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,856
Here, let me help you guys.

802
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,733
You just have to plug this.

803
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,489
Okay.

804
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,782
So as per your instructions,

805
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:30,037
we've divided all our assets and accounts
between Hong Kong and Singapore.

806
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:34,917
And I'm quite certain that that part of
the instructions are to favor your side.

807
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,711
Good to see you again, Byron.

808
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:39,004
Alice.

809
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,425
It's nice to meet you also, Ma'am Alice.

810
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:46,345
I'm Bettina, Sir Byron's EA,

811
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:48,138
and this is Helen and Mei-Li.

812
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,849
Part of our core staff in Top Hong Kong.

813
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,643
Pleasure to meet you, ladies.

814
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,145
I see you've done your homework.

815
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:58,148
Even a list of all our clients
here in Singapore.

816
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,234
I'm sure you have done the same.

817
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,944
Are they joining us?

818
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:03,529
Just me.

819
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,656
I think we can start now,

820
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:08,700
and I'll use those
as the basis for our discussion.

821
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,537
What are you playing at, Alice?

822
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:14,122
I'm not playing at anything, Byron.

823
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:19,086
Things just get so contentious
between us when others are involved.

824
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,338
Maybe our competitive side kicks in.

825
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,384
I just want to start things
on the right foot.

826
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,887
Just you and me.

827
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,724
To finally figure things out?

828
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,105
Leave us.

829
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,441
Are you sure, sir?

830
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,443
Yeah.

831
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,613
I'm willing to give this a shot.

832
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:08,093
Miss Alice still looks great at 50.

833
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,803
I wonder what's the secret.

834
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,973
Whose side are they on?

835
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:17,436
We may not be part of their meeting
but we're still on standby.

836
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:18,520
Okay?

837
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:20,606
Don't leave the hotel.

838
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,902
Hello again, Ma'am Bettina.

839
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:28,655
-Here's another one.
-If you're free, maybe…

840
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,241
Please stop annoying me.

841
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,994
Go ahead. I mean, come in, please.

842
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,162
Come in, ma'am.

843
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,539
Thank God.

844
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,588
Bye, Jared.

845
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,592
We miss you, darling!

846
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:50,677
We miss you!

847
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:51,762
Hey.

848
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,347
What happened to Mom?

849
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:57,267
We went to a Korean barbecue place,
and Mom drank a lot of rice wine.

850
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:58,977
Heartbroken again?

851
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:00,604
Totally.

852
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,898
You judge harshly, guys.

853
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,400
I'm just like you, you know.

854
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:06,818
The only difference is

855
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:09,321
I love young men.

856
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,865
You love an old man.

857
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:13,325
Mom!

858
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:17,162
This is not about my love life, okay?

859
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:18,872
About you.

860
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:21,291
Shouldn't you be careful in love?

861
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:24,086
I'm just not like your sister.

862
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:28,090
I can't control my feelings.

863
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:32,219
When the heart beats, go!

864
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:35,347
We just want you to be careful, Mom.

865
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,474
You can fall in love…

866
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,394
with the right man…

867
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,438
in the right situation.

868
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:45,941
You're stressed, sis?

869
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,526
Working out didn't help?

870
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,569
Let's talk about it?

871
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,864
There's nothing I can't handle on my own.

872
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:56,326
Well, you should take
your own advice, sister.

873
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,662
Mom and I are here for you.

874
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:00,956
You don't have to keep it to yourself.

875
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,833
I have to go.

876
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:04,876
Bye.

877
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,044
I need to go inside.

878
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,713
All right, just call us.

879
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,636
But promise, ma'am.

880
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,221
I won't bother you anymore.

881
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:19,099
If he didn't interfere,
Byron wouldn't stop.

882
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,225
So, fine.

883
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,478
I'm sorry too. I haven't
even talked to you properly.

884
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:25,731
That's fine, ma'am.

885
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,358
Maybe just focus on your work.

886
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,527
Then when you're ready,

887
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,529
I'm in the elevator.

888
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,180
You know, I've…

889
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:01,016
asked the chef to prepare
the same meal that

890
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:04,436
we had together when
we made our first 100 million.

891
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:14,279
Well, this is just me trying to
make a fresh start on the right foot. So…

892
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,573
Okay.

893
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,452
I'll see you tomorrow, Alice.

894
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:24,748
What?

895
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,209
What? What is it?

896
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:28,585
Oh, God.

897
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:31,004
You know I have to make
nice with her, right?

898
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:32,547
She's got the upper hand.

899
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:33,965
And you know what?

900
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:38,053
I wouldn't be in this position
if you hadn't made a mistake.

901
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,846
Mistake or not,

902
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,848
don't talk to me like that ever again.

903
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:45,519
I know you're my boss,
but I am still your girlfriend.

904
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,772
Treat me with some respect.

905
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:50,607
I think I deserve it.

906
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,610
Of course I reacted that way.
I was blindsided.

907
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:58,156
I am not gonna give away any part
of the company to Alice without a fight.

908
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,866
Come on, why don't you?

909
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,326
What?

910
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:04,371
Alice always brings out the worst in you.

911
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:07,415
Why don't you just sell her everything?

912
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,044
You've got all the money that you need.

913
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:15,006
You've got nothing to lose.

914
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:17,843
You'll be free.

915
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,429
We can even start something of our own.

916
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:24,432
Easy for you to say.

917
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:29,813
I have spent years. I'm talking
blood, sweat and tears on this!

918
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,357
I'm not just gonna give it away.

919
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:36,611
I would have thought that you,
of all people, would understand that?

920
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:41,950
Fuck.

921
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:52,669
Nice play on Bettina, bro.

922
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:56,006
Well, easing up on her was the right move.

923
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:59,217
Believe it or not, boys, it wasn't a play.

924
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:02,304
Wait, what? I thought
you said she was the enemy?

925
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:04,890
-Nothing more than the boss's chick.
-A bitch!

926
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,725
-Hey!
-Come on, boys.

927
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:09,519
Yeah, but maybe I was wrong.

928
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:13,523
I overheard her with her co-workers, and…

929
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,026
I heard that she has
a lot of problems also.

930
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:19,905
She has a job to do,
she has a boss to answer to.

931
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:22,991
Made me think that
maybe she's just like us.

932
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:26,202
And like us,
she needs help from time to time.

933
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,538
Like our app, that's what it's for, right?

934
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:34,544
-Good morning, Ma'am Bettina.
-Good morning, Ma'am Bettina.

935
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,796
-Are you ready to work?
-Ready.

936
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,715
Give me five minutes
to change clothes.

937
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:40,133
What about now, ma'am?

938
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:42,218
So, do you believe in me?

939
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,055
God.

940
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:47,432
We still have lots to do.

941
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,227
But I'm ready to bet on you.

942
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:56,816
Lean thinking provides
value to the customer.

943
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,902
Anything else is a waste.

944
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:02,948
I read that so many times
during my MBA program.

945
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:06,034
-Ma'am, you have an MBA?
-Hey!

946
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,954
What do you think I am? Stupid?

947
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:12,123
Ma'am, it's just…

948
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:15,794
you made it difficult for yourself.

949
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,671
So, lazy?

950
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,632
No, because…

951
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:23,468
Byron is already your boyfriend.

952
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,262
So…

953
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:28,556
Gold digger.

954
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,433
No, ma'am.

955
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:35,689
To be clear, I mean that
I also dream of getting an MBA.

956
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,065
But you did it.

957
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:40,151
And even if you have a rich boyfriend,

958
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,778
you still work.

959
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,363
Working hard.

960
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,073
I'm amazed by you.

961
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,199
That's cool.

962
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:48,118
You don't have to say sorry.

963
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:50,120
I'm in this relationship.

964
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:52,789
I'm ready to hear anything.

965
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:56,001
It's even more complicated
because of our setup.

966
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:57,877
Their divorce is still not finalized.

967
00:54:58,503 --> 00:54:59,671
I mean…

968
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:01,756
I love him.

969
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:06,052
We won't last long if I don't.

970
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:09,097
But a lot can happen.

971
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:13,268
And at the end,
I just want to bet on myself.

972
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,478
That's all.

973
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,606
Sounds like you too, right?

974
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:22,944
To be shameless and
pitch inside the elevator.

975
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:24,404
That's difficult.

976
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:26,281
That takes guts.

977
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:28,116
That's betting on yourself.

978
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:32,037
And when the time comes,
increase the bet.

979
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:35,915
Just pursue all your MBA dreams.

980
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:00,440
Directly plan on how
To make life more luxurious

981
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:02,901
There is no stopping the looking for gold

982
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:04,069
Sheesh

983
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:07,405
God.

984
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:09,115
It's in my head.

985
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:15,121
You're back!

986
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:18,583
That means we can celebrate together.

987
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:23,797
Because I have just secured
all our accounts in the Philippines…

988
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,048
from Alice.

989
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:27,550
Try the shrimp.

990
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:30,136
You're making it up to me
by giving me shrimp?

991
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,223
By my estimate,
that would swing everything…

992
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:34,974
60-40,

993
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,268
-our way.
-Cheers to that.

994
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:40,814
Hey, listen.

995
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:45,068
I know you're happy,
but I got to work tonight.

996
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:49,114
Jared's waiting on me.

997
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,074
Wow.

998
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:54,828
Prioritizing elevator boy over boss man.

999
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,497
Seems you're getting along.

1000
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,957
Are you jealous?

1001
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:03,378
You're with your ex the whole day.
I don't complain.

1002
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:05,630
I mean…

1003
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,007
Now that I got to spend time with him,

1004
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:11,761
I see that he's more than just
an elevator boy with a good idea.

1005
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:15,181
Should I be worried?

1006
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:18,518
No, not at all.

1007
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,062
He even tried to defend me earlier.

1008
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:23,648
Defend you? What happened?

1009
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:26,276
Relax, it was nothing.

1010
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:29,195
There was this businessman who hit on me.

1011
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,322
And despite being twice his size,

1012
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:33,992
I saw that Jared wanted
to punch him for me.

1013
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:36,494
So I guess, you could also call him brave.

1014
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:39,706
Kind. Funny. Easy to be with.

1015
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:42,292
Anyway, I got work tonight.

1016
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,502
Also, I'll be seeing him again tomorrow.

1017
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,381
Yeah. But…

1018
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,633
The shrimp?

1019
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:52,427
The shrimp…

1020
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,727
And lots and lots of confidence.

1021
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,562
I feel if it's just confidence,

1022
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:04,105
I can give you that.

1023
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:06,691
This is good.

1024
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:13,323
Is it okay if…
I pay you in installments?

1025
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:15,742
No need.

1026
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,076
It's on me.

1027
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,745
That's my investment in you.

1028
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:22,165
It's worth it,
because you are my future CEO.

1029
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,668
-Are you serious?
-I'm serious!

1030
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:31,132
Thank you, Bettina.

1031
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,219
But,

1032
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:37,263
why are we wearing the same clothes?

1033
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:41,976
Because I make this look good.

1034
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,105
Look at this friend of yours.

1035
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,732
He was so shy before.

1036
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:48,858
But he can do it.

1037
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,443
He's like that.

1038
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:52,862
You thought he's just simple.

1039
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,949
But he'll shock you.
He will always surprise you.

1040
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,492
Especially when…

1041
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,661
If he really wants to,
and he thinks he can…

1042
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:03,414
God, he won't stop until he does it.

1043
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:06,668
I've experienced that.
He didn't give up on me.

1044
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:09,254
All in. He gives it all.

1045
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,632
So, that's why we are happy
that he met you.

1046
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:20,473
Our friends and I always support him,
but what you're giving him is different.

1047
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:23,476
You just don't keep up sometimes.

1048
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:27,897
You push him to do things
he never thought he could do.

1049
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:06,686
It's my first time seeing you like that.

1050
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:12,191
Byron requested that
I wear my best clothes.

1051
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,401
So here.

1052
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:16,904
We're going out with
his high school friends later.

1053
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,158
What's wrong with them?

1054
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:21,242
Nothing.

1055
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:22,869
They're arrogant.

1056
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:24,287
All they do is flex.

1057
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:25,872
Ego contest.

1058
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:27,874
You know, guy stuff.

1059
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:32,629
Girls, go to dance.

1060
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,047
-Come on!
-Nice.

1061
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:37,508
Come on, Bettina. Don't be shy.

1062
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:38,676
Join us, bitch.

1063
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,386
-Go dance with them.
-No.

1064
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,429
Fuck it!

1065
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:43,181
You asking me to do stupid things?

1066
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,974
What's wrong with your friend?

1067
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:47,310
She must be too shy.

1068
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:51,147
Hey, babe, how's it going?

1069
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:52,273
Come on.

1070
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:54,651
Great. We're leaving?

1071
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:56,069
What? No.

1072
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,820
I haven't seen these guys in ages.

1073
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:59,614
We gotta stay longer, all right?

1074
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:02,784
Listen, all right?
I'll keep you company, all right?

1075
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:04,827
Come on. Come to Daddy. Come on.

1076
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:07,705
Come on. That's right. Come on, come on.

1077
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:08,873
Come on.

1078
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:09,957
What are you doing?

1079
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:13,086
I just wanna show
that I got the hottest girl in town.

1080
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,128
-Okay?
-Not here.

1081
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:15,922
Lighten up. Don't embarrass me.

1082
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,301
Come on.

1083
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:21,427
Come on.

1084
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:25,973
What the fuck, Byron?

1085
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:29,686
I am your girlfriend,
not your fucking slut!

1086
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:45,576
What happened?

1087
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:52,917
I'm…

1088
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,335
Bettina, if…

1089
01:01:55,628 --> 01:02:00,341
If there's anything I can help,
if you want to talk, fix…

1090
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:03,302
Good thing I'm off now.

1091
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:05,221
Do you want to talk downstairs?

1092
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:39,297
Thank you.

1093
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:45,678
I'm…

1094
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,013
I'm sorry.

1095
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,820
What the fuck did I do?

1096
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,922
Listen. I'm almost done with Alice.

1097
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:24,342
Okay? And you can finish off
what you have to with Jared.

1098
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:26,427
Don't waste all that effort.

1099
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:30,056
And then you and I, we can go home and…

1100
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:34,519
I'll make it… I'll make it right again
until things are back to normal.

1101
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:37,021
I'll make it up to you. I swear.

1102
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:39,482
Just please, please stay.

1103
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:11,681
I've been waiting for you.

1104
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:16,102
You want to talk about what happened?

1105
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:17,186
No need.

1106
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:20,606
I messaged you.

1107
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:24,318
I'm fine.

1108
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,447
It was a mistake.

1109
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:32,410
Can we just forget about it?

1110
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:35,037
Please?

1111
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:43,337
You came back here crying.

1112
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:46,549
You kissed me and then you left.

1113
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:50,261
I hope, before you tell me
to forget everything,

1114
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:52,597
first explain to me what happened.

1115
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,482
Byron and I had a fight.

1116
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:06,485
I was drunk.

1117
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:08,696
I was driven by my anger,

1118
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:10,907
and frustration.

1119
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:13,576
I'm sorry.

1120
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:17,455
I dragged you into our problem…

1121
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:19,790
Into my drama.

1122
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,961
I think of you as a friend.

1123
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,300
So whatever your problem is,

1124
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:33,679
whatever made you commit a mistake,

1125
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:35,765
to kiss me,

1126
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,393
just tell me.

1127
01:05:41,562 --> 01:05:43,022
I will help you.

1128
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,442
I make mistakes…

1129
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:50,196
because you're like that.

1130
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:53,908
You're sweet…

1131
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:57,286
Caring…

1132
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:00,873
And I believe you.

1133
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,340
But our time is up.

1134
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:12,718
We have to return to the real world.

1135
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:17,056
Where I have to leave
and you have to stay.

1136
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,315
Friend.

1137
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:34,448
Let's just keep it there.

1138
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:36,826
Okay?

1139
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:44,000
You have a lot to lose, Jared.

1140
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:48,295
To us.

1141
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:55,553
The pitch is near.

1142
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:58,222
Let's just email each other.

1143
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:01,058
So we don't complicate matters.

1144
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:04,687
Okay?

1145
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:08,274
Dude, I don't know what happened.

1146
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:10,067
I drove them both to the club,

1147
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:12,862
but hours later,
only Byron rode back with me.

1148
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:15,322
It must have been a big fight
if she left him.

1149
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:16,407
Yeah.

1150
01:07:16,615 --> 01:07:19,910
But, the important thing is, she says,

1151
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:23,080
"You're sweet and I believe you."

1152
01:07:24,915 --> 01:07:27,084
She has feelings for you, bro.

1153
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:28,377
Maybe that's true.

1154
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:31,380
Bro, maybe you have a chance.

1155
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:32,798
Yeah, bro.

1156
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:36,302
And I've deleted the video,
so there's no reason to worry about Byron.

1157
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:39,180
You just focus on your next move
on Bettina.

1158
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,351
Please listen to her.

1159
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:46,604
Just do what she wants.

1160
01:07:47,104 --> 01:07:48,606
For all of us.

1161
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,613
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you, sir.

1162
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:17,426
Cheers!

1163
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:35,736
You know, we have to admit
that after all that's happened between us,

1164
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,698
we did build something
pretty special together.

1165
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:44,161
God, Byron. Is this the way
we're gonna start renegotiations?

1166
01:08:44,995 --> 01:08:47,456
I thought we finally agreed
on a clean split.

1167
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,792
Yes, I know, but…

1168
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:53,879
Haven't you ever wondered
why it didn't work out?

1169
01:08:55,756 --> 01:08:56,966
I guess…

1170
01:08:57,508 --> 01:09:00,386
because we grew our money
more than our love.

1171
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:02,847
And that broke us.

1172
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:06,100
So how do you wanna move on from here?

1173
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:10,396
Well, I think we need contracts to move.

1174
01:09:11,438 --> 01:09:12,898
We sure do.

1175
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:16,861
We have the contracts ready.

1176
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:23,284
Once signed, the division between
the Hong Kong and Singapore

1177
01:09:23,367 --> 01:09:26,579
will be incorporated into
the finalization of your divorce.

1178
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:36,297
Now that we have assessed
and agreed on our value,

1179
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:38,257
I have a better offer.

1180
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,217
Here.

1181
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:53,397
Wait. After all that, you just want out?

1182
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:57,318
But…

1183
01:09:59,236 --> 01:10:01,488
But… I don't agree to this price.

1184
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:04,450
-All right? It's way too high.
-Then how much?

1185
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:09,038
Less 20 percent.

1186
01:10:09,121 --> 01:10:10,247
Okay.

1187
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:13,500
Less 30.

1188
01:10:17,838 --> 01:10:18,881
But why?

1189
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:21,508
Byron,

1190
01:10:22,843 --> 01:10:26,180
I've never apologized for cheating on you.

1191
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:29,433
I broke us.

1192
01:10:30,267 --> 01:10:31,810
And I'm sorry.

1193
01:10:34,146 --> 01:10:36,690
This is my way of making amends.

1194
01:10:36,815 --> 01:10:39,109
You can take half of what's there.

1195
01:10:39,693 --> 01:10:43,447
I think it should be enough
for me and my baby.

1196
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:48,786
I wanna move on and be happy.

1197
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:51,705
And I hope you do the same for yourselves.

1198
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:04,176
Bro!

1199
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,594
Where have you been?

1200
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:07,596
I was just with my bartender friend.

1201
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,723
She saw everything that happened.

1202
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:13,143
It's okay. I'm already
trying to do the right thing.

1203
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:14,728
Dude, no, bro.

1204
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:17,940
How do you know?
You don't even know the whole story.

1205
01:11:18,023 --> 01:11:21,110
If Bettina is important to you,
know the truth.

1206
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:23,654
Right?

1207
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:26,865
So guys, this is how it went down.

1208
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:29,743
She ended up slapping Byron hard, bro.

1209
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:32,997
Like he was touching
her everywhere, all this stuff.

1210
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:36,041
And then she just walked out.
What happened was…

1211
01:11:49,179 --> 01:11:50,931
He shouldn't have disrespected you.

1212
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:54,351
I don't know how you found out,
but I'm moving on from it.

1213
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:55,769
What?

1214
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:59,315
-Move on from him!
-And what?

1215
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:01,108
My career?

1216
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:03,027
The life I built?

1217
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:05,112
Should I just throw it all away?

1218
01:12:05,195 --> 01:12:07,531
Yes, because what's the point
if you're not happy?

1219
01:12:07,614 --> 01:12:09,325
Don't assume how I feel.

1220
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:10,826
I know what I'm doing.

1221
01:12:10,909 --> 01:12:12,453
I can handle myself.

1222
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,372
If you would only open your eyes,

1223
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:17,499
if you could see what I see,

1224
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:19,501
you will be impressed, too.

1225
01:12:19,626 --> 01:12:22,629
You would not tie yourself
to Byron or his money.

1226
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:25,257
Because you're capable of more.

1227
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,343
Why don't you bet on yourself?

1228
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:30,888
You've been in this elevator for too long.

1229
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:34,641
Things are not just up or down.

1230
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:37,811
Life is not that simple.

1231
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:41,231
Because what, because…
in the real world again?

1232
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:44,318
What? Are we going back to that?

1233
01:12:48,822 --> 01:12:50,282
So I'll change it.

1234
01:12:54,119 --> 01:12:55,746
I will show you.

1235
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:03,670
But what can I do?
Byron has put me on a leash.

1236
01:13:03,754 --> 01:13:05,089
He controls me.

1237
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:06,173
Us.

1238
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:08,092
I need to break away from it.

1239
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:09,468
Once I'm able to do it,

1240
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:12,179
Bettina will realize
that she can also be free.

1241
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,891
We're supposed to be celebrating, right?

1242
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:25,943
It's just been a long month
for the both of us.

1243
01:13:26,026 --> 01:13:27,152
Tell me about it.

1244
01:13:28,445 --> 01:13:30,948
For someone who
got everything that he wanted

1245
01:13:31,031 --> 01:13:32,658
and maybe even more,

1246
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,161
you don't seem so happy.

1247
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:43,794
Marry me.

1248
01:13:45,712 --> 01:13:47,798
We've talked about it, right?

1249
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:49,716
Now, we can actually do it.

1250
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,802
I'm gonna call my jeweler

1251
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:55,681
and you can pick anything you want
when we get back to Hong Kong.

1252
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:01,019
Are you proposing…

1253
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:02,980
because you want to?

1254
01:14:03,897 --> 01:14:06,525
Or because you feel that
Alice has won over you?

1255
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:10,404
What? No! I told you, Alice is my past.

1256
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:12,448
And you are my future.

1257
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,158
And…

1258
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:16,160
I love you.

1259
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:31,049
"Thank you again for the opportunity."

1260
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:33,510
What the fuck?

1261
01:14:35,929 --> 01:14:38,932
Look, calm down. Let me talk to him, okay?

1262
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:43,520
Jared, you did the right thing.

1263
01:14:43,687 --> 01:14:47,608
Look at me. You've done it before.
You can get another investor.

1264
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:50,152
Didn't you decide too quickly, Jared?

1265
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,571
Love wins!

1266
01:14:53,238 --> 01:14:55,449
Fuck Byron and fuck his money!

1267
01:14:55,532 --> 01:14:57,242
All of it! Fuck Byron!

1268
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:59,912
-Fuck him, man.
-He's a piece of shit.

1269
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:02,206
No! Fuck you, Jared!

1270
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:04,958
I've been going around
the hotel following you

1271
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:06,919
because I believed in you.

1272
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:08,212
"Just bring them to me."

1273
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:10,714
"I'm the captain.
I'll get them to bet on us."

1274
01:15:10,797 --> 01:15:12,382
But you threw that all away!

1275
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:14,968
I promise I'll find another investor.

1276
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:16,011
When?

1277
01:15:16,094 --> 01:15:19,723
You said it also. This is
our last year to make it work.

1278
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:24,895
Good for you. You got a shot with Bettina,
but I was supposed to propose to my girl.

1279
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:29,525
You're not a captain, bro.
You're just fucking selfish.

1280
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:30,692
Senin.

1281
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:32,903
-What's going on?
-Don't! Don't!

1282
01:15:32,986 --> 01:15:34,905
-Senin!
-Don't!

1283
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:37,074
Relax, bro.

1284
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:49,670
Why did you back out?

1285
01:15:52,464 --> 01:15:53,465
Because of you.

1286
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:58,971
Fuck you, Jared.

1287
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,976
Please, Bettina, don't fight with me.

1288
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:05,811
I've had that all day.

1289
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:07,396
What else would I say,

1290
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:11,024
if I'm really the reason why
you're backing out of your dreams?

1291
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:13,986
I don't want that burden.

1292
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:18,615
I've convinced Byron to buy your app.

1293
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:19,741
I suggest you take…

1294
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:22,661
It's not about money anymore, Bettina.

1295
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:24,037
It's about you.

1296
01:16:24,621 --> 01:16:25,956
It's about us.

1297
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:27,916
There's no…

1298
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:29,793
us,

1299
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:31,461
Jared.

1300
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:33,422
There is me,

1301
01:16:34,214 --> 01:16:35,716
there is you,

1302
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:38,594
and we have our own shit to deal with.

1303
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:41,805
So I suggest you just take the money

1304
01:16:41,888 --> 01:16:43,890
and use it to change your life.

1305
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:46,727
So that you can be free from this.

1306
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:49,688
Don't be stupid because of me.

1307
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:01,033
You know that soliciting guests,

1308
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:03,118
especially our VIPs,

1309
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:05,329
is strictly against hotel rules.

1310
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:07,581
But sir, I wasn't soliciting,

1311
01:17:07,664 --> 01:17:10,292
I was just giving them
a business proposal.

1312
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:13,795
If you did it outside of our premises,
that would be fine.

1313
01:17:14,921 --> 01:17:18,425
But during your shift,
I've got CCTV footage of you doing so.

1314
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:26,016
Then. Okay, sir,
I will accept my punishment.

1315
01:17:26,099 --> 01:17:28,935
I have no choice, Jared.
I have to terminate you.

1316
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:33,065
But, sir, I still have five months left
on my contract.

1317
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:34,566
I have no choice.

1318
01:17:35,275 --> 01:17:38,236
Unless you can tell me
if anyone else was with you?

1319
01:17:38,612 --> 01:17:42,908
A guest did say that he saw you signaling
someone else from our staff.

1320
01:17:47,537 --> 01:17:50,040
Look, I'll spread the penalty across you.

1321
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:52,250
You'll take a lighter hit.

1322
01:17:56,296 --> 01:17:58,965
No, sir, it was just me.

1323
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:02,719
I did everything on my own.

1324
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:07,224
Okay.

1325
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:12,229
Why did you ask Helen
and Mei-Li to hire developers?

1326
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:13,647
What do you think?

1327
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:16,817
We already agreed to buy
the app from Jared.

1328
01:18:17,317 --> 01:18:20,904
-There's no need to copy--
-Fuck that! And fuck that elevator boy.

1329
01:18:20,987 --> 01:18:22,406
I haven't cut him a check.

1330
01:18:22,489 --> 01:18:25,617
I'm not gonna reward him
for turning his back on me.

1331
01:18:31,331 --> 01:18:33,875
Byron, look, you already got him fired.

1332
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:35,168
That's on him.

1333
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:38,547
But there is no need to destroy him.

1334
01:18:39,631 --> 01:18:42,676
That money will change Jared's life.

1335
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:45,137
Don't take that away from him.

1336
01:18:48,014 --> 01:18:51,309
-The way he took you away from me?
-Whatever you think happened,

1337
01:18:52,602 --> 01:18:53,437
didn't.

1338
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:57,524
Jared didn't do anything.

1339
01:18:58,608 --> 01:19:01,820
He just got caught up
between us and our own shit.

1340
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:04,072
What shit?

1341
01:19:05,115 --> 01:19:06,658
We built something great.

1342
01:19:08,034 --> 01:19:09,494
Where did we go wrong?

1343
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:14,166
We grew our money more than our love.

1344
01:19:16,376 --> 01:19:18,170
Listen, you heard what you heard.

1345
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:19,880
I've got nothing with Alice.

1346
01:19:19,963 --> 01:19:22,591
And I have nothing with Jared.

1347
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:27,846
And if you really want us to move on,

1348
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:31,516
and if you really meant what you said,

1349
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:34,728
you will give Jared his due.

1350
01:19:38,482 --> 01:19:39,733
Do it for me.

1351
01:19:43,987 --> 01:19:46,323
I still have a few months on my rent.

1352
01:19:46,406 --> 01:19:49,451
Maybe I'll just find a temporary job
while I'm here.

1353
01:19:49,534 --> 01:19:50,535
Jared.

1354
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:52,579
Even if you get kicked out,

1355
01:19:52,996 --> 01:19:54,623
you can stay with me and Ikmal.

1356
01:19:54,706 --> 01:19:56,917
-Yes, you can sleep on the floor.
-No!

1357
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:59,085
Thank you, bros.

1358
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:02,839
You can also stay with me, bro.

1359
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,635
Panying told me what happened.

1360
01:20:06,718 --> 01:20:08,178
Thank you for having my back.

1361
01:20:08,261 --> 01:20:11,056
No, no, no. Everything is my fault.

1362
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:15,185
Because of me,
everyone here almost lost their jobs.

1363
01:20:15,268 --> 01:20:18,230
I'm also sorry I messed up all our plans.

1364
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:19,314
No, bro.

1365
01:20:20,732 --> 01:20:22,734
I'm sorry for being a dick to you.

1366
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:24,444
When we all leave,

1367
01:20:25,111 --> 01:20:27,113
you have no one to go home to,

1368
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:29,241
no one to hug you,

1369
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:30,826
to kiss you,

1370
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:32,744
to say "I love you."

1371
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:35,247
Bro, so you're saying…

1372
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:37,666
I'm lonely and…

1373
01:20:37,749 --> 01:20:39,042
I will die alone?

1374
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:43,755
I get Bettina… I get it.

1375
01:20:44,631 --> 01:20:46,216
So, go get her.

1376
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:49,052
There's nothing to lose, right?

1377
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:50,512
Now you'll stop at…

1378
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:54,099
Looking for gold! Sheesh!

1379
01:20:55,058 --> 01:20:57,602
-Go, Jared. Go! Go!
-Go get her!

1380
01:20:57,686 --> 01:21:00,689
-Thank you, bros!
-Go! Go! Go!

1381
01:21:00,772 --> 01:21:03,275
-Go, Jared, go!
-Go!

1382
01:21:08,071 --> 01:21:09,281
Billy!

1383
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:12,117
Perfect timing. I need access.
Come on. Let's go.

1384
01:21:12,742 --> 01:21:14,703
Okay. Thank you, bro. Thank you.

1385
01:21:24,170 --> 01:21:25,171
Bettina?

1386
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:29,050
Bettina?

1387
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:32,387
Bettina?

1388
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:33,680
Bro!

1389
01:21:33,763 --> 01:21:35,265
They already checked out.

1390
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:39,519
If I was on shift,
I could have warned you.

1391
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:41,563
Their flight is in an hour.

1392
01:21:41,646 --> 01:21:43,106
There is no reason to worry.

1393
01:21:43,189 --> 01:21:44,774
By the time you get there,

1394
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:47,402
I'll call someone,
we can meet in 20 minutes.

1395
01:21:47,485 --> 01:21:49,446
-Yes, we can.
-Yes.

1396
01:21:49,529 --> 01:21:50,822
We can delay them a little.

1397
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,866
Okay, perfect. Then we can call him up.

1398
01:21:52,949 --> 01:21:54,743
Then, I will drive over.

1399
01:21:54,826 --> 01:21:57,287
I have a cousin who works in security,

1400
01:21:57,370 --> 01:22:00,916
engineering, actually, in the airport.
We can delay…

1401
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:10,175
I'm sorry for kissing you.

1402
01:22:11,134 --> 01:22:13,094
I didn't mean for it to happen.

1403
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:15,096
Sorry that I've messed you up.

1404
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:19,100
When Byron did what he did,
I felt disrespected and cheap.

1405
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:23,313
When I saw you that night, I saw you.

1406
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:28,360
How you look at me, how you treat me.

1407
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:33,406
That's why I admire you.
That's actually cool.

1408
01:22:34,866 --> 01:22:37,869
If you admire me, I also admire you.

1409
01:22:38,828 --> 01:22:42,207
And I wanted your comfort.
I wanted to feel better.

1410
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:46,044
But what I did to you
is what he did to me.

1411
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:47,504
That's me…

1412
01:22:47,587 --> 01:22:49,631
being selfish and weak.

1413
01:22:50,256 --> 01:22:51,758
I'm sorry for that.

1414
01:22:53,176 --> 01:22:54,302
But, you know,

1415
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:57,806
I've messed you up,
and you've messed me up too.

1416
01:22:57,889 --> 01:22:59,182
You're a jerk.

1417
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:01,643
I told you…

1418
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:04,521
You are not allowed
to fall in love with me.

1419
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:07,774
Because I might fall in love with you too.

1420
01:23:07,857 --> 01:23:09,484
It's about you.

1421
01:23:10,235 --> 01:23:11,736
It's about us.

1422
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:16,741
There's no

1423
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:18,284
us,

1424
01:23:19,202 --> 01:23:20,203
Jared.

1425
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:29,254
Even if I can't bet on us now,

1426
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:31,965
I still care for you.

1427
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:37,804
And I want to protect you.

1428
01:23:41,599 --> 01:23:44,477
But I was happy in that elevator with you.

1429
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:46,688
I hope that it was just that simple.

1430
01:23:46,771 --> 01:23:49,024
I hope it's just going up or down.

1431
01:23:49,649 --> 01:23:51,359
But our lives go left and right,

1432
01:23:51,484 --> 01:23:53,069
and everything in between.

1433
01:23:53,945 --> 01:23:57,741
Maybe, when we're both okay,
you'll catch me again when I fall.

1434
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:00,118
Until that happens,

1435
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:01,494
just work hard.

1436
01:24:01,578 --> 01:24:03,538
Just go ahead with all the plans.

1437
01:24:03,621 --> 01:24:04,622
For me.

1438
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:06,249
Please.

1439
01:24:07,417 --> 01:24:08,710
Bet on yourself.

1440
01:24:22,098 --> 01:24:24,768
Bro, what?

1441
01:24:24,851 --> 01:24:26,186
Let's go.

1442
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:29,105
You can still catch her.

1443
01:24:36,029 --> 01:24:36,988
She's gone.

1444
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:38,156
It's okay.

1445
01:24:39,824 --> 01:24:41,534
She made up her mind.

1446
01:24:42,577 --> 01:24:44,162
Let's just respect it.

1447
01:24:55,131 --> 01:24:57,592
Are you staying, sir,
or heading out?

1448
01:24:57,717 --> 01:25:00,220
I have a meeting downstairs.

1449
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:06,351
Are you sure you won't change your mind
on increasing the job placement fee?

1450
01:25:07,018 --> 01:25:11,022
Our app is meant to give
migrant workers like me a chance

1451
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:12,565
to work on their off days.

1452
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:14,567
So we can beef up our savings,

1453
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:16,945
we can come home earlier than expected,

1454
01:25:17,028 --> 01:25:19,948
or even just achieve
whatever it is we dream of.

1455
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:25,620
So you think that if you don't
take a cut from these people,

1456
01:25:25,703 --> 01:25:27,122
they will trust you more?

1457
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:29,290
Sir, if we earn it,

1458
01:25:29,374 --> 01:25:32,335
they will be loyal to us
and that will be our USP.

1459
01:25:32,418 --> 01:25:34,129
And also, I'm not in a hurry.

1460
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:37,632
Our app, The Weekend Warrior,
is already online and running.

1461
01:25:37,715 --> 01:25:40,510
And I just want to grow
our 2,000 members

1462
01:25:40,593 --> 01:25:43,054
into a real community
and not just a work pool.

1463
01:25:43,179 --> 01:25:45,807
I already like the app that you built.

1464
01:25:45,932 --> 01:25:48,393
And I also really like your mindset.

1465
01:25:48,935 --> 01:25:52,689
So, you can expect
my investment tomorrow morning.

1466
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:56,067
Thank you, sir. I will ask my staff

1467
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:58,820
to send the contracts
over to your office right away.

1468
01:25:58,903 --> 01:26:00,280
Yes, of course. Thank you.

1469
01:26:00,363 --> 01:26:01,489
Thank you.

1470
01:26:04,284 --> 01:26:05,535
Shall we?

1471
01:26:05,618 --> 01:26:06,619
After you, sir.

1472
01:26:07,078 --> 01:26:08,079
Thank you.

1473
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:12,542
It's different now, boy.

1474
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:21,885
I didn't waste what Bettina gave me.

1475
01:26:21,968 --> 01:26:25,221
By the grace of God,
my friends still supported me.

1476
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:30,602
Of course, we didn't stop at…

1477
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:32,103
You already know that.

1478
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:45,700
But when you're not busy,
when it's time to breathe and rest,

1479
01:26:45,783 --> 01:26:47,452
it's also sad to be alone.

1480
01:26:50,496 --> 01:26:52,165
Can I get you a beer, sir?

1481
01:26:52,248 --> 01:26:54,292
Maybe a scotch.

1482
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:55,752
I'll get one.

1483
01:26:55,835 --> 01:26:56,836
Thank you.

1484
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:07,597
They are right.

1485
01:27:07,805 --> 01:27:09,265
Love is important.

1486
01:27:09,974 --> 01:27:12,310
And I know that now because of Bettina.

1487
01:27:12,435 --> 01:27:15,521
She taught, pushed, and improved me.

1488
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:18,733
Too bad she didn't love me
the way I wanted.

1489
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:22,570
I would have been with her in all of this.

1490
01:27:23,821 --> 01:27:29,035
But I'm still thankful for
every ups and downs of my elevator.

1491
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:34,707
Someone came in to disturb,
break and open my heart.

1492
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:40,421
Thank you, sir.

1493
01:27:41,297 --> 01:27:44,133
Right on cue. It's getting dramatic.

1494
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:48,263
Son of a bitch!

1495
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:12,120
So,

1496
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:15,081
what are you doing here?

1497
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:18,459
Your friends told me something.

1498
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:22,380
They said that there's an app
that I need to know about.

1499
01:28:23,923 --> 01:28:27,969
It's like it copied the app
I bought last year.

1500
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:32,640
If you mean Good Job,
it's so different from my app.

1501
01:28:33,182 --> 01:28:35,393
Good Job is a permanent job listing.

1502
01:28:35,768 --> 01:28:39,272
My app is per project and per task basis.

1503
01:28:39,355 --> 01:28:41,733
For migrant workers' side jobs.

1504
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:42,942
Well said.

1505
01:28:43,901 --> 01:28:45,611
I had a great teacher.

1506
01:28:48,114 --> 01:28:49,198
How's Byron?

1507
01:28:51,617 --> 01:28:52,827
It's over.

1508
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:54,579
Why?

1509
01:28:56,372 --> 01:28:57,623
He's an asshole.

1510
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,128
So,

1511
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:06,507
I'm here to make a fresh start.

1512
01:29:08,134 --> 01:29:10,136
I wanna make my own bet.

1513
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:12,764
I wanna hear your pitch.

1514
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:16,267
So that I can bet on you.

1515
01:29:21,856 --> 01:29:23,483
Well, if that's the case,

1516
01:29:23,566 --> 01:29:26,819
then can I invite you into
my corner office, please?

1517
01:29:29,405 --> 01:29:31,366
-One more, please?
-Yes, sir.

1518
01:29:37,413 --> 01:29:39,624
By the way, it's past office hours,

1519
01:29:39,707 --> 01:29:44,337
so maybe I can offer you a drink
and I can pitch to you in my room.

1520
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:45,797
If you don't mind.

1521
01:29:46,255 --> 01:29:47,215
It's right there.

1522
01:29:47,298 --> 01:29:49,801
See that?
Surfboard on top of the building.

1523
01:29:49,884 --> 01:29:51,511
That's my room. That's my room.

1524
01:29:56,516 --> 01:29:58,267
Parents, friends, my support,

1525
01:29:58,351 --> 01:30:00,561
they're the reason why I don't stop.

1526
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:03,272
There is no stopping the looking for gold.

1527
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:04,315
Sheesh!
