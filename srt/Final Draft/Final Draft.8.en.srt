YOSHIO ITOI, 43
FORMER PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL PLAYER

4
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:25,225
- We're back.
- Déjà vu.

5
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,359
- For sure.
- Totally.

6
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:30,764
- It's a little cold.
- It was warmer last time.

7
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:34,367
I wonder who's still in it.
It's exciting, you know?

8
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,102
- Yeah, seriously.
- So exciting.

9
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,371
This is gonna be intense, this battle.

10
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,206
- Right.
- Right.

11
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:43,076
- There were a lot of tough competitors.
- True.

12
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,145
Oh! Who's this?

13
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,413
Hey there. Welcome.

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,516
- How are you doing? Been a while.
- Long time no see.

15
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:51,084
It really has been.

16
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,620
Looks like we've got
the soccer players and the ladies.

17
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,523
- Right!
- All soccer players.

18
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:58,458
Just the ladies and the soccer team.

19
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:00,326
- Totally.
- What?!

20
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,128
Who is this?

21
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,164
Look who it is.

22
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,965
- How's it going?
- Hey, everyone.

23
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:07,534
None of us know who's coming.

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,601
You didn't make it?

25
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,137
- The two of us left in a pretty sad way.
- Yeah, it was rough.

26
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:12,138
Really?

27
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:13,706
Honestly, it made sense.

28
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,611
You were eliminated?

29
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:20,613
- The studs!
- The elite squad.

30
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,315
- You were favored to win.
- That's insane.

31
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,350
- You were heavily favored.
- Look who it is.

32
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,486
- Well, well.
- Our team got beat.

33
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,755
- Our team lost. Yeah.
- Your whole team?

34
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,191
I wonder who's gonna win this thing.

35
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,525
Yeah, I don't know.

36
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:42,335
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>We are about to begin the Red Stage.</i>

37
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,840
- I'm nervous just watching.
- Who'll it be?

38
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,274
I'm feeling nervous.

39
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,176
Why are we the ones who are so anxious?

40
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,945
- Who is it?
- I can't wait to find out.

41
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,913
- Kenta.
- Yeah, or Itoi.

42
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,682
I really hope Kenta's in.

43
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:57,484
- There they are.
- They're here.

44
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,320
- Wait, who is it?
- No idea.

45
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,089
Look! Hozumi!

46
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:07,660
- Who else?
- It's Shozui!

47
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,729
- Shozui!
- Shozui!

48
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,065
- Go, Shozui!
- Look, there's Itoi!

49
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,666
Itoi!

50
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,201
Let's go!!

51
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:17,971
Crazy!

52
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:20,106
- Really?!
- Amazing!

53
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,009
- Hey, Kurihara's not there, is he?
- Yeah, Kurihara's gone!

54
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:24,611
Come on.

55
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,182
Oh man.

56
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,484
- Takashi, what happened?
- He's injured.

57
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,986
- Nice.
- Great job!

58
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,254
Congrats.

59
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,190
Nice work!

60
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,225
- Thank you!
- Amazing job.

61
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:42,395
- Well done.
- Is that a sprain?

62
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,063
- What happened?
- A full sprain, yeah.

63
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,267
- Oh man, that's rough.
- It looks crazy, right?

64
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,770
This battle.
All of them are absolutely insane.

65
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,973
They overcame some crazy challenges.

66
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,542
For real.

67
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:12,292
<i>Attention. Round one will now begin.</i>

68
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,196
<i>Each round is 30 minutes.</i>

69
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:19,966
<i>Whoever pushes the goal button first</i>
<i>will earn one point.</i>

70
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,036
<i>Each time a competitor earns a point,</i>

71
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,838
<i>their button will move</i>
<i>one meter further away.</i>

72
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,141
<i>If the match ends without a winner,</i>

73
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,644
<i>everyone's goal buttons</i>
<i>will move one meter closer.</i>

74
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,416
<i>The first competitor</i>
<i>to earn two points will win.</i>

75
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,787
<i>The winner will claim 27 million yen</i>
<i>in prize money.</i>

76
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,456
<i>At the sound of the buzzer,</i>

77
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:44,991
<i>begin Round 1.</i>

78
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,863
<i>One is a champion, the other superhuman.</i>

79
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,299
<i>Competing against these elite athletes</i>

80
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:57,136
<i>means that I must be</i>
<i>more determined than ever,</i>

81
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,605
<i>even if I die trying.</i>

82
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,308
<i>I wanna fight</i>
<i>in a way that I can be proud of</i>

83
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,843
<i>and hold my head high.</i>

84
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,446
<i>Of course I'm confident.</i>

85
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:08,915
<i>I wanna give it everything I've got.</i>

86
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,728
- Amazing! Unbelievable!
- That was incredible.

87
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:04,831
That was brutal.

88
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:09,235
<i>One point is awarded to Yoshio Itoi.</i>

89
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,538
<i>If he reaches the goal again,</i>
<i>he will be the winner.</i>

90
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:22,281
<i>Yeah, yeah. I could feel Itoi's power.</i>

91
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:23,783
<i>He's incredibly strong.</i>

92
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,453
<i>I thought I might be able to stabilize</i>
<i>if I could reach the holds.</i>

93
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,590
<i>But I couldn't…even get that far,</i>

94
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:35,228
<i>and it made me realize</i>
<i>how tough this challenge was going to be.</i>

95
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:42,502
I could feel the difference
in strength between the three of us.

96
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,471
But there was no way
I would let it end like that.

97
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:50,777
I didn't experience closure as an athlete.

98
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,347
I want another chance
to achieve greatness.

99
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,517
<i>When you were cut from the team…</i>

100
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,018
WIFE: HONAMI

101
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,020
<i>…you weren't sure</i>
<i>what you were going to do next.</i>

102
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,056
I stayed in Sendai
instead of going back to Osaka.

103
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,592
- Yeah, yeah.
- And I joined a sales company.

104
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,463
That was such a challenging phase for us.

105
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,699
During that time, so many things happened

106
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,969
that worried you or put you on edge.

107
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:20,106
<i>Sure, but I knew</i>
<i>that somehow it would all work out.</i>

108
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:24,277
<i>I know you so well, and I think</i>
<i>you're someone who works incredibly hard.</i>

109
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,547
<i>If you decide</i>
<i>that you're definitely going to win,</i>

110
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,782
<i>then I have no doubt that you will.</i>

111
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,818
<i>I have so much faith in you.</i>

112
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,252
<i>Do your best. Okay?</i>

113
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,989
I'm definitely gonna win.

114
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:38,724
I'll reward your faith.

115
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,926
<i>Oh!</i>

116
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:44,697
<i>I can't afford to lose</i>
<i>this competition to Itoi.</i>

117
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,100
<i>I need to defeat the superhuman.</i>

118
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,139
<i>I'm excited to be</i>
<i>in the same room as Itoi.</i>

119
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,919
- Your swing is pretty good.
- Yeah, but I couldn't hit.

120
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:12,358
With that much potential, I think
you definitely could have gone pretty far.

121
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,863
<i>Obviously, Itoi is a well-known athlete,</i>

122
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,565
<i>but I have to defeat him.</i>

123
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:23,636
<i>Shozui comes from</i>
<i>a baseball background, just like me.</i>

124
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,139
<i>But I'm a veteran player,</i>

125
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,108
<i>so a lot of pride is at stake.</i>

126
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,577
<i>I can't afford to lose to him.</i>

127
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,614
From here on out,
it's all about endurance.

128
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,450
- This is where it starts.
- This is so insane.

129
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,754
<i>We will now begin the second round.</i>

130
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:47,126
<i>One point has been awarded to Yoshio Itoi.</i>

131
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:51,030
<i>His goal button</i>
<i>has been moved to a new position</i>

132
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,431
<i>one meter further away.</i>

133
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,834
Whoa, crazy. This is gonna be tough.

134
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:58,804
<i>If Yoshio Itoi wins this round,</i>

135
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,207
<i>he will be the </i>Final Draft <i>champion</i>

136
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,911
<i>and claim 27 million yen in prize money.</i>

137
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,815
<i>At the sound of the buzzer, begin Round 2.</i>

138
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,209
Come on.

139
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,040
<i>Five minutes have passed.</i>

140
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:30,322
Yoshio!

141
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:42,101
<i>I was barely hanging on.</i>
<i>My right arm was saving my life.</i>

142
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:58,217
- Shozui's too far off the ground.
- He's too upright.

143
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,919
He has to get lower.

144
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,856
- Itoi's making a move.
- He's locking his foot in.

145
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,491
Yeah, to save energy.

146
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,001
<i>Ten minutes have passed.</i>

147
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,813
<i>The longer the battle goes on,</i>
<i>the more tired they'll get,</i>

148
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,548
<i>and I've got better stamina.</i>

149
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,621
- Wow!
- A little more. Hook your foot!

150
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,290
- Wow! That's incredible!
- Itoi's unreal!

151
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,910
Nothing left to grab onto.

152
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,446
Getting to that button
is still a long way off.

153
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,285
<i>Fifteen minutes have passed.</i>

154
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,953
- Fifteen minutes?
- What?

155
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,454
It's become a standoff.

156
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,456
This is insanely difficult.

157
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,903
Don't give up. You can do this.

158
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,605
Just don't quit.

159
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,613
No!

160
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,952
Look at that! Shozui!

161
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:55,020
Come on! Let's go!

162
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,305
Man, this looks so hard.

163
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,074
Endurance. That's what it's about.

164
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,642
That's how Shozui wins.

165
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,580
<i>Twenty minutes have passed.</i>

166
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:29,782
That's crazy!

167
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,618
<i>Ten minutes remaining.</i>

168
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,496
Shozui!

169
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:18,764
Come on, come on, get up!

170
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,732
- Hang in there, you got this!
- Go, Shozui!

171
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,000
Oh no, this is bad.

172
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,192
Okay. Let's do this.

173
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,629
Let's go. You got this.

174
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:24,630
Here we go.

175
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,302
Keep going.

176
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,294
Just pull. Pull forward.

177
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:57,829
Keep pulling.

178
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,533
Pull forward.

179
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:03,936
Damn it.

180
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,283
<i>Twenty-five minutes have passed.</i>

181
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:21,553
<i>Five minutes remaining.</i>

182
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:49,948
Hang in there, Hozumi!

183
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:53,151
- Hozumi's holding up pretty well.
- Most people would be spent.

184
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,487
Hozumi's holding strong
with these guys pulling.

185
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:00,959
<i>I thought they might be tired,</i>
<i>so I tried to pull, but I couldn't move.</i>

186
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,800
<i>I just couldn't move anymore.</i>

187
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,506
It's so far.

188
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,443
There's so much ground to cover.

189
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,049
<i>Thirty seconds remaining.</i>

190
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,088
Damn it.

191
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,124
He's so strong.

192
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,825
Seriously.

193
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:43,769
<i>Ten seconds remaining.</i>

194
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:00,185
<i>The second round is a draw.</i>

195
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:04,556
<i>At this time,</i>
<i>we will take a 30-minute break to rest.</i>

196
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:09,961
What a battle.

197
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,086
<i>This was the hardest by far.</i>

198
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:37,389
<i>I mean, the first day</i>
<i>up the mountain was tough, too,</i>

199
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:39,791
<i>but for me, this was way more challenging.</i>

200
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,994
<i>I never imagined it would last 30 minutes.</i>

201
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:49,434
<i>I'm not sure how,</i>
<i>but I managed to maintain my grip.</i>

202
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,003
<i>I wanted to reach it.</i>

203
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:55,474
<i>The button was close,</i>
<i>but still so far away.</i>

204
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:00,312
<i>There were a few times I almost gave up.</i>

205
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,781
<i>But Kurihara fought through worse.</i>

206
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:06,318
<i>Compared to what he went through,</i>
<i>this was nothing.</i>

207
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:08,920
Ah, that hurts!

208
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,389
So painful.

209
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,258
- Oh man.
- That's incredible.

210
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:18,296
<i>We will now begin Round 3.</i>

211
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,634
<i>Since no one reached their goals</i>
<i>in Round 2,</i>

212
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:26,705
<i>everyone's buttons were moved</i>
<i>one meter closer.</i>

213
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,111
<i>The only thing I'm thinking about</i>
<i>is winning.</i>

214
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,113
- Shozui!
- Hang in there!

215
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:38,517
- Come on, Hozumi, let's go!
- Yeah, you got this, Hasegawa.

216
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,620
- Good luck, Itoi.
- You got this!

217
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,957
<i>At the sound of the buzzer, begin Round 3.</i>

218
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,727
Wow, Shozui!

219
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,329
- No way!
- So fast!

220
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:25,230
Shozui!

221
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,901
<i>Yuya Shozui has now earned one point.</i>

222
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:35,807
<i>I kept my hope alive.</i>

223
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:42,113
<i>Yoshio Itoi or Yuya Shozui</i>

224
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,550
<i>will become the </i>Final Draft <i>champion</i>

225
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:48,753
<i>and claim 27 million yen</i>
<i>if they win again.</i>

226
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,456
I can't run anymore.

227
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,225
<i>We had a short break,</i>

228
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,928
<i>but afterwards</i>
<i>I felt like my legs were completely spent.</i>

229
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,031
<i>I might be reaching my limit.</i>

230
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,733
<i>I can't run.</i>

231
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:06,037
<i>I mean, he's young,</i>
<i>so I'm sure he recovers faster.</i>

232
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,841
Come on, don't let this slip away.

233
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:13,378
<i>It's victory or death.</i>

234
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,213
<i>I must win this.</i>

235
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,383
Ready, up!

236
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:22,287
<i>I see myself fighting for my teammates</i>

237
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,822
<i>who ultimately lost.</i>

238
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,557
<i>I fought my way here.</i>

239
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,569
- Nice!
- Nice!

240
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,305
I'm not just competing for myself

241
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,541
but for all the other athletes here.

242
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:45,176
I'll do my best.

243
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:46,878
I'll win it all.

244
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:48,547
Thanks so much.

245
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,348
- Okay.
- Nice!

246
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:53,285
Nice, Shozui! I'm counting on you to win.

247
00:25:57,255 --> 00:26:00,725
<i>I have to give it</i>
<i>everything I've got and claim victory.</i>

248
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,763
This is a great match.

249
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:08,099
I bet the match will go
a lot faster this time around.

250
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:12,537
<i>It's incredibly tough.</i>

251
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:15,307
<i>It takes a toll,</i>
<i>both mentally and physically.</i>

252
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,311
<i>I think this is</i>
<i>where I have to push past my limits.</i>

253
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:25,550
<i>We will now begin the fourth round.</i>

254
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:29,854
I'm definitely gonna win this.

255
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:34,025
<i>One point has been awarded to Yuya Shozui.</i>

256
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:36,461
<i>As a result,</i>

257
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:40,098

<i>one meter further away.</i>

258
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,787
<i>At the sound of the buzzer, begin Round 4.</i>

259
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:49,094

276

That was a real gift to watch.

277
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,786

I'm so sorry.

293
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,023
Well, of course,
in the end, I couldn't win it,

294
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:02,927
but honestly, I have no regrets.

295
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:06,397
I still think it matters
whether you win or lose,

296
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:07,699
but this reminded me again

297
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:10,468
that what matters most
is accepting the challenge.

298
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:15,240
So I will continue to challenge myself
in all areas of my life.

299

Uh,

301
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:26,451
I mean, I lost the first time
during the team battle,

302
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:31,256
and I tried to carry the hopes
of those who wouldn't return.

303
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,791
I truly wanted to win.

304
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:38,963
And I wanted to say to you all,
"This win was for you."

305
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,700
But… I came up short and couldn't win it.

306
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:46,237
Still, I gave it everything,

00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:04,042
Even though I couldn't claim victory,

347
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:09,013
I never imagined
I'd end up feeling so at peace.

348
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,314
So now

349
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:13,818
I can step away from sports
with no regrets.

350
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:15,520
Thank you so much.

351
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:18,322
At first, I really hated the crew,

352
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,259
and I hated the other athletes too.
I didn't wanna talk to them

353
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:23,594
and certainly didn't wanna live
under the same roof.

354
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:26,297
But in the end, we became friends.

355
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:28,699
And for that, I'm grateful.

356
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:32,070
I think one of the great things
about this competition

357
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:35,807
is how it gives the spotlight
to some less popular sports.

358
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:40,378
And maybe people saw those athletes
and thought, "I wanna try that."

359
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:43,848
So I hope this competition
reaches people all over the world.

360
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:48,653
You know that tension before a match
or that emotional high,

361
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,590
it was so great to experience that again.

362
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:55,159
In the end, I'm just so grateful.

363
00:34:55,660 --> 00:35:00,064
I agreed to join this competition
for redemption after the Olympics.

364
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:03,935
And if I'm being honest,
I didn't quite achieve that.

365
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:07,205
But it really inspired me

366
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:11,109
to keep moving forward
with the work I'm doing right now.

367
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:16,047
Getting to compete against elite athletes
in this kind of competition

368
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,249
feels like a dream, even now.

369
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:21,085
You know,
I chose a totally new line of work,

370
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:24,021
but this reminded me how great sports are.

371
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:27,525
Yeah, I just had a ton of fun.

372
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,427
It was great.

373
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,797
Now that I've retired and become a mother,

374
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:36,033
it felt good
to return to a competitive environment

375
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,435
and be an athlete again.

376
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:42,140
My child might grow up and watch this
and think "Wow, Mom is amazing."

377
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:43,674
That would be so great.

378
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:46,878
I'd love that.
I told myself I wasn't gonna cry!

379
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:49,280
Athletes are incredible.

380
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:53,818
I realized just how pure-hearted
we truly are.

381
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,989
I gotta say,
I don't think I've ever formed

382
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,892
such strong bonds with people
so quickly in my life.

383
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:04,896
As fellow athletes,
they were irreplaceable.
