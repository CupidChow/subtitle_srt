To be honest, I was relieved

16
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:15,008
when the fourth person
was eliminated from the competition.

17
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,577

To be honest,
when I announced my retirement,

41
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:06,085
I thought,
"Maybe it's not time to quit yet."

42
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:09,289
So I'd like to make it
as far as possible in <i>Final Draft</i>,

I wasn't able to fully compete
on that same level

but in the end,

316

I wasn't strong enough.

00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,260
I'll have to accept
that my time here was short.

to work even harder.

Thank you. Thank you.

351
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:21,780
<i>In third,</i>

352
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,448
<i>Atsushi Arai.</i>

353
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:24,383
Nice.

354
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,119
- You're in a good position.
- Yeah, nice, nice.

355
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:41,833
Whoa.

356
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,368
- Wow.
- Whoa!

357
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,437
- Look at this.
- Amazing.

358
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:46,638
It's pretty good.

359
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,807
- How cool is this?
- Incredible.

360
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,809
- Wow, a pool?
- A pool!

361
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,077
This is fantastic!

362
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,813
This is unreal!

363
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,015
Look at the rooms. They're amazing!

364
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:57,949
Wanna go in?

365
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:00,118
Open!

366
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,553
Oh wow!

367
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,088
This is awesome.

368
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,289
This is amazing.

369
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:07,159
- Wow!
- Okay, this is great.

370
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,460
Glad I did my best.

371
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,796
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's warm.

372
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:13,332
- Wow, it's warm!
- It's warm.

373
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:15,334
- It's warm.
- This is amazing.

374
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,435
It must be heated.

375
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,071
It's fully equipped with a heater
and everything. This is amazing.

376
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,506
- We can sleep comfortably.
- It's like a hotel.

377
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:22,908
It's perfectly firm.

378
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,344
Ah, it's warm!

379
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,112
It's so warm in here!

380
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:30,816
- Damn, it's so comfy!
- We earned it.

381
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:33,485
I'm excited
to be in the same room as Itoi.

382
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,728
- Glad we won.
- Glad we won.

383
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:47,199
Okay, so I wanna keep living like this.

384
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:48,767
I don't know about the low scorers,

385
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,703
but I bet they have
sleeping bags or something.

386
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,904
Sleeping bags?

387
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:55,073
- Really?
- This isn't that great.

388
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,109
- Come on.
- Is this it?

389
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,177
- This is tiny.
- I can't believe it.

390
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:00,779
- So small.
- Seriously.

391
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,414
I can't believe this.

392
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:06,351
- It looks cold!
- Women in the three-bed.

393
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,754
Okay, the ladies will take
the three-person room.

394
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,989
Yeah, but it's dangerous,
so maybe I should join them.

395
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,091
No, no, no, no, no, no.

396
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:17,229
I'm so curious to see
what it's like inside those tents.

397
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,030
Here we go!

398
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,202
I can't even sit.

399
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:28,540
We're supposed to sleep in sleeping bags.

400
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,843
- We can't fit in these.
- I'll be falling out of this.

401
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:35,547
- I won't even be able to roll over.
- No way.

402
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,949
This is terrible.

403
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:41,186
The other guys, all they did was sit-ups.

404
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,387
So narrow!

405
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:46,324
I won't be able to compete tomorrow
after sleeping in here.

406
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:49,594
- At least we're not outside.
- That's true.

407
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:51,730
- We have a room.
- Yeah. Absolutely.

408
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:52,764
It's not bad.

409
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:55,267
Yeah, yeah. I'm okay with this.

410
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,902
But we haven't seen the other team's.

411
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,271
- I don't wanna see their tents.
- Oh, no, no, no.

412
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,009
The floor is so hard!

413
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,711
Is this a blanket?

414
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,181
This isn't a blanket. It's a throw.

415
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:10,982
Oh!

416
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,685
But… it's kinda warm underneath.

417
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,154
Like some kind of heater.

418
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:17,989
Okay, that's nice.

419
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:21,426
I'm just speaking my thoughts out loud.

420
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,868
<i>Attention, everyone Dinner is ready.</i>

421
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:33,638
<i>Will the high scorers please gather</i>
<i>by the poolside?</i>

422
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,106
A poolside meal sounds good.

423
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,375
- Look at this!
- Looks great! So good!

424
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:39,711
- Let's eat!
- This is awesome.

425
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,279
Super fancy.

426
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:43,582
Eel? There's even crab!

427
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,251
- Amazing!
- This is for the high scorers.

428
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:49,855
- T-bone steaks.
- T-bone.

429
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:51,690
- Ah, there's eel!
- Eel?

430
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:53,258
Eel? Awesome!

431
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,295
- Red king crab.
- Crab is awesome.

432
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:58,563
I love red king crab.

433
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,365
- Mind-blowing.
- Perfect!

434
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:03,034
I hope we get to keep enjoying all this.

435
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:05,003
- Let's all do our best.
- Agreed!

436
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,572
- Let's eat!
- Let's eat!

437
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:09,341
I'm so happy.

438
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,744
- It's good.
- Wow.

439
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,246
Ah, the meat is so tender.

440
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:16,982
Mmm! It's super tender.

441
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:20,719
Itoi, you look good with crab.
A big crab suits you.

442
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:23,421
Tasty!

443
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,557
I'm so hungry.

444
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:27,425
I'm starving.

445
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,429
<i>Attention, everyone. Dinner is ready.</i>

446
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:35,166
<i>Low scorers,</i>
<i>please return to the main area of camp.</i>

447
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:37,202
Her voice, I don't like it.

448
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,803
"Low scorers"?

449
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,405
- The "low scorers."
- The "low scorers."

450
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,374
I hate her name for us.

451
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,875
- "Low scorers."
- The "low…"

452
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,382
- This is it, huh?
- This?

453
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:51,416
That's it?

454
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:52,851
That's it?

455
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,154
<i>Onsen tamago</i>?

456
00:25:57,255 --> 00:26:00,492
- They put chicken tenders in it.
- Oh, I understand now.

457
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,796
I thought this was <i>tonjiru</i>,
but this is just seaweed!

458
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,365
No way!

459
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:08,667
This is too funny.

460
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,901
It's simple.

461
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,505
- This is it for dinner?
- Looks like it.

462
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,807
- Not the best.
- There's not much here.

463
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,208
You again, Little Rhino?

464
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:19,411
Rhino?

465
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:21,479
Kouzi said I looked like a rhino.

466
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:22,914
- Little Rhino.
- Yes.

467
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:25,116
Little Rhino, could you say something?

468
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:26,785
Okay, everyone, put your hands together.

469
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:27,986
Yes, okay.

470
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,956
Let's get to the high scorers group
and eat delicious meals.

471
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,191
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat!

472
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,328
- This is fun though.
- It's great.

473
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:38,363
I can only move up from here.

474
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:42,634
Oh, this soup tastes good.

475
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,536
- This is good.
- I feel like it's good.

476
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,739
It's surprisingly good, actually.
I'm starting to like it.

477
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,180
<i>Attention. The Call Room will now be open.</i>

478
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:57,315
- Call Room?
- What's the Call Room?

479
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,884
<i>Throughout the rest of the competition,</i>

480
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:03,588
<i>you can talk to family and friends</i>
<i>for 30 minutes once a day.</i>

481
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,290
- Family?
- Thirty minutes?

482
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:06,291
That's great.

483
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:08,960
Hi.

484
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:09,861
WIFE: HONAMI

485
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:10,829
<i>How are you doing?</i>

486
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:12,764
<i>You're working hard. How was it?</i>

487
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,399
I'm first in the rankings.

488
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,467
<i>Ooh!</i>

489
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:18,503
And honestly, it's making me feel
even more grateful,

490
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,439
for all of the support
you've given me throughout

491
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,042
the competition so far.

492
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,477
Thank you so much.

493
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:26,611
<i>Thank you.</i>

494
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:31,549
I think of this as something
the two of us are doing together.

495
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:34,386
I mean,
I feel like there's been plenty of stuff

496
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,921
that must have worried or annoyed you.

497
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:40,592
<i>When you were cut from the team</i>
<i>and didn't know what to do.</i>

498
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,695
I didn't know what to do.

499
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:45,597
I worked part-time as a mover

500
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,899
and worked like crazy
under the scorching sun

501
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,434
to earn 10,000 yen.

502
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:51,369
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

503
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,104
<i>And because of that hard work,</i>

504
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,706
<i>when someone does something for you,</i>

505
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,409
<i>you feel a different sense of gratitude</i>
<i>because you've been there.</i>

506
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:58,576
Well, tomorrow,

507
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,813
I'll win again. And soon I'll say,

508
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,314
"I won the 30 million."

509
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:04,416
<i>You'll say that?</i>

510
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:05,817
Just you wait.

511
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:08,953
<i>I have no doubts.</i>
<i>You're a man of your word,</i>

512
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,790
<i>so if you decide</i>
<i>that you're definitely going to win,</i>

513
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,925
<i>I'm certain that you'll make it happen.</i>

514
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:16,127
<i>And, in the meantime,</i>

515
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,863
<i>I hope that you're able</i>
<i>to enjoy the moment</i>

516
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,200
<i>while you focus on</i>
<i>what you hope to accomplish.</i>

517
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:23,968
<i>Mm.</i>

518
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:27,472
Eme.

519
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,609
I feel like you've gotten bigger somehow.

520
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:33,545
WIFE: RUNA
ELDEST DAUGHTER: EME

521
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:37,615
I miss you both.

522
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,051
It's been tough so far.

523
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:41,853
There were times

524
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,723
when I thought about giving up,
to be honest.

525
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:48,426
But in those moments,
I just tried to picture your faces.

526
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,762
I am so grateful

527
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:52,797
to hear your voices

528
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:56,468
for the first time in a while.
It makes me want to try even harder.

529
00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:00,171
The prize is substantial
if I can make it until the end.

530
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,340
- <i>How much?</i>
- 30 million yen.

531
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,209
<i>Wow, that's awesome.</i>

532
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:05,677
I know, right?

533
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,045
A vacation would be nice.

534
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,647
But we also need a bigger house
for our next baby.

535
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:11,483
<i>Yes, we do.</i>

536
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:15,720
I want you to see
that I gave it my all one more time,

537
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:17,622
and Eme hasn't seen that.

538
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:20,959
- <i>Mm.</i>
- So I want her to see how Daddy does.

539
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:21,926
<i>Mm.</i>

540
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,695
I want her to see

541
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:28,266
how hard her dad is trying to win
that prize money for her.

542
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:32,070
<i>Yeah. I've seen you</i>
<i>compete in the Olympics and stuff,</i>

543
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:35,740
<i>but of course, I want our daughter, Eme,</i>

544
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:42,547
<i>and the baby who's on the way to see</i>
<i>how their daddy represented himself</i>

545
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,182
<i>and all rugby players.</i>

546
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:47,452
<i>It'll be great to tell them</i>
<i>how you kept pushing yourself</i>

547
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,988
<i>and how you kept taking on new challenges.</i>

548
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,491
Thank you.

549
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,730
Anyway, I thought
I want to give it everything I have,

550
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,765
for our family, you know?

551
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,201
So keep believing in me

552
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,370
and wait for me to come home with the

553
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,872
30 million yen.

554
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:09,507
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- </i>Eme!

555
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:11,476
<i>Say, "Do your best."</i>

556
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:12,677
<i>Do your best.</i>

557
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:13,745
Thank you.

558
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:29,761
Oh!

559
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,296
This is amazing.

560
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:39,537
Oh my God!

561
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:42,807
Thank you.

562
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:47,178
Places that have <i>neppashi</i>
are crazy.

563
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,147
A <i>neppashi</i>? I was a <i>neppashi </i>once.

564
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:51,482
- No way. You're lying!
- Seriously. When I was 18.

565
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:52,984
- Seriously?
- Yes.

566
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,752
- No. Were you really?
- Yes.

567
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:57,055
I'd say "I'm gonna start
a Finnish-style <i>löyly</i>."

568
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,022
What?!

569
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,292
That would have been a sight.
I wish I'd seen it.

570
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,694
It was great.

571
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,662
Was it 570 times?

572
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:07,165
About that much.
Toward the end, I started losing track.

573
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,367
That's crazy. Legendary stuff.

574
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,070
Ah, this feels good.

575
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:14,906
The bath is too cold to get in.

576
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:17,876
- Totally. But I'll give it a try anyway.
- Really?

577
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:19,677
- If it's too cold, I'll say.
- Okay.

578
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,553
- It's that cold?
- Yes.

579
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:31,155
Ah, this is great.

580
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:34,425
But for real,
for about two or three months,

581
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:36,294
my wife did everything she could

582
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,363
to help me manage my meals and when I ate.

583
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:39,264
I see.

584
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:43,801
And she ate the same food that I ate,
which was extremely limited.

585
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:44,969
- She ate your diet?
- Yes.

586
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,105
So when I get home,
we're gonna eat what we want.

587
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,140
- Going in?
- One more time.

588
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,011
Damn, it's still really cold.

589
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,214
- Oh man, it's cold!
- It's colder on the inside.

590
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,216
You know, today…

591
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:01,019
I figured it out today, Kouzi.

592
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,289
I feel like guys like you
are super popular with women.

593
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:06,658
On the one hand, you play the field a lot,

594
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:10,228
but on the other hand,
you're also a true gentleman.

595
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:12,764
- You're pretty crafty.
- <i>It is time to go to bed.</i>

596
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:17,101
<i>Please get plenty of rest</i>
<i>in preparation for tomorrow.</i>

597
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:19,904
Shut up.
I'll decide what time I go to bed.

598
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,941
- I forgot about my birthday.
- Huh?

599
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:23,908
It's tomorrow.

600
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,110
Seriously? It's tomorrow?

601
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:27,478
- Yeah.
- What?!

602
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:28,913
I'm gonna be 29.

603
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,349
Ugh, 30 is around the corner.

604
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:33,351
- Good night.
- Sleep well.

605
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,286
All right.

606
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:36,421
- Amazing.
- It hurts.

607
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:37,755
Ugh, it hurts.

608
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:39,123
My abs hurt.

609
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,558
Shall we sleep?

610
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,304
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

611
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,306
Morning.

612
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,275
- Wow.
- Oh, it looks good.

613
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,544
- Wow, there's a lot of fruit.
- Luxurious.

614
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,713
- Even breakfast is great.
- Looks good.

615
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,815
Oh my gosh, looks good.

616
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:05,984
- Eggs.
- What's with these egg rolls?!

617
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,453
- It was cozy last night.
- Yeah, it's been great.

618
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,222
- It was good.
- The heater worked too.

619
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,057
Do you think that…

620
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,459
…the other guys got breakfast?

621
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,661
- No breakfast?
- You think they will?

622
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:19,297
The way that they placed the food
is careless.

623
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,332
- They have bananas.
- Milk has protein.

624
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:22,700
Oh, they have milk.

625
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:25,370
- Salted rice balls.
- No side dishes?

626
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:28,406
Let's see what they put in the miso soup.
What are the ingredients?

627
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:31,075
- Eggs. That's all I want right now.
- Let's open this up.

628
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:32,477
Oh!

629
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:35,013
- Pretty good.
- We can be happy just with this.

630
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,449
- Looks good.
- Something to make us feel good.

631
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,785
What do you think
the high scorers got to eat?

632
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:41,819
Something great.

633
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:44,355
- Crab and T-bone steaks, apparently.
- Crab?

634
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:46,190
- Crab?
- T-bone steaks and--

635
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:47,358
T-bone steaks?

636
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:52,096
- It's that different?
- But they're all old geezers.

637
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,867
So it all evens out.

638
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,508
<i>Attention. At this time,</i>

639
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:05,176
<i>put yourselves into groups.</i>

640
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:06,177
Whoa!

641
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,779
- What?
- Really?

642
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:08,679
What?

643
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,314
<i>Ask someone to join your group,</i>

644
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:14,018
<i>and form groups of four</i>
<i>before the next competition begins.</i>

645
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,520
What does she mean?

646
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:16,454
It's teams?

647
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,222
- Wow. For real?
- Team competition?

648
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:19,190
Groups?

649
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:20,625
Groups of four?

650
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:22,760
Wait. Any four?

651
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:23,661
There are 20 people,

652
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,130
so there will be
five groups of four people, right?

653
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:27,665
I wonder what the competition is.

654
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,800
That's tough.

655
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:31,335
We don't even know
what kind of competition it's gonna be.

656
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,871
So it would be better
to combine various attributes,

657
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:36,207
like combining upper body strength
with leg strength.

658
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,676
Yeah, it might be better
to have a balanced team, for sure.

659
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,778
- Look who's here.
- Have you decided?

660
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:41,813
They're here.

661
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,915
- Have you divided up?
- We haven't decided.

662
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:44,982
I can't decide.

663
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:46,818
We don't know what the competition is.

664
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:49,220
Without knowing
what the competition will be,

665
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:50,755
I want to be on a team with people

666
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:53,357
who are currently ranked the highest.

667
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,358
Team up?

668
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,894
I want to team up with Shozui.

669
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:00,298
- Should we add a woman to our team?
- Tosaka.

670
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:01,699
- Eri.
- Eri.

671
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:03,167
- Join us.
- Me?

672
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,336
- Eri, what do you say?
- You want me?

673
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:06,871
We're the same age, so…

674
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,307
Goya and Arai are the same age as I am,

675
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:12,543
so I think it will be easier
for us to communicate with each other.

676
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:16,114
I was excited
about competing with Hozumi Hasegawa.

677
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,582
I respect him a lot.

678
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:19,784
- Hozumi, will you team up with me?
- Shall we?

679
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,085
- Let's go, Onikura.
- Really?!

680
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:22,653
Itoi.

681
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:24,956
- Itoi!
- Let's go!

682
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:28,059
We've agreed upon our four.

683
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,428
I'm sure
there's going to be a competition soon

684
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:33,030
that will need a lot of strength.
That's why I thought,

685
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:35,133
"Okay, there's Kenta."

686
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,668
<i>"That guy is about as strong as it gets."</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

687
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,609
<i>The time has come.</i>

688
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:47,612
<i>When you have agreed</i>
<i>on your group of four,</i>

689
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:49,480
<i>please proceed to the arena.</i>

690
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:01,926
This room again.

691
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,328
- And here we are.
- Here we are again.

692
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:06,197
We've been in this room before.

693
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,834
But this is good, don't you think?
I'd say we're pretty balanced.

694
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,269
- Yes.
- As a team.

695
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,537
A good balance.

696
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:14,939
Hi, guys.

697
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,541
- Ah!
- Hey!

698
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:17,775
All right.

699
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,343
Let's do this!

700
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:28,119
Kuri is really well-balanced.

701
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,021
Koji is super strong.

702
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:31,689
And I have explosive speed.

703
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,825
I knew that all of us
would make a great team.

704
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:39,463
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Look who it is.

705
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:43,568
Oh, so it's that kind of team.

706
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:45,836
They have a woman too.

707
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:48,172
We'll have a hard time
if the challenge requires agility.

708
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,374
- You're right.
- A balance competition.

709
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:53,411
- You'd have great balance.
- We wouldn't do well with balance.

710
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:56,347
Oh, it's the boxing team.
They're gonna box. They're boxers.

711
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,083
Ugh, seriously?

712
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,722
The reason we included Hayasaka…

713
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,290
- Hayasaka.
- Hayasaka.

714
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:08,025
Gymnastics?

715
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:10,595
Yeah, it's his birthday,
so I think he'll work even harder.

716
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:12,964
Hayasaka, wanna team up with us?

717
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,298
I was glad they chose me.

718
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:18,769
I let it slip that it was my birthday.
I was surprised he remembered I said that.

719
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:21,272
He's a world champion,
but he's such a nice guy.

720
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:22,840
I thought it was amazing.

721
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,142
I think our whole team
is pretty explosive.

722
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:26,911
And here we are.

723
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:30,147
Look at this squad. Incredible. Yes.

724
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:33,150
- This team is so strong.
- Wow, what a team.

725
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:34,852
- Look at them,
- They're all great.

726
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,654
- Strong team.
- Intimidating.

727
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:38,856
They're covering all angles.

728
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,091
A balanced team.

729
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,394
All the athletes who had the top scores

730
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:45,730
in the first competition have teamed up,

731
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:47,498
so that team is the strongest. Yeah.

732
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:56,274
<i>The next challenge is the Blue Stage.</i>

733
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:59,910
<i>This stage will test your judgment.</i>

734
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:01,912
- Oh, our judgment.
- Our judgment.

735
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:03,347
What's that mean?

736
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:05,483
So it's not about strength?

737
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:07,084
Judgment?

738
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,654
<i>Please proceed to the stage.</i>

739
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,489
- Let's do this.
- Let's go!

740
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,467
- Huh?
- What?

741
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:24,602
What?

742
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,671
Ooh!

743
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:27,772
What is this?

744
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:30,408
- What's going on?
- Wait, what?

745
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,475
No way.

746
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:33,744
- Whoa.
- Wait. What?

747
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,780
- I don't get it.
- What's that?

748
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:38,249
Damn, my heart is pounding like crazy.
It won't stop.

749
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,318
- I'm getting nervous.
- Damn. What is this?

750
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:43,154
<i>Now we will test your judgment.</i>

751
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,489
<i>In the Blue Stage, your challenge will be…</i>

752
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:49,760
<i>…the monkey bars.</i>

753
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:52,630
- No way.
- Monkey bars?

754
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:53,731
Crazy.

755
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:56,634
I think this is gonna be tough.

756
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:59,236
It'll be toughest
for those carrying the most weight.

757
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:01,706
It's not a strength-focused competition
at all.

758
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,275
Once again, I'm at a disadvantage.

759
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,910
How will it test our judgment?

760
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:07,378
This involves judgment?

761
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:08,746
<i>In the first half,</i>

762
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:12,683
<i>each competitor will advance</i>
<i>on a separate course.</i>

763
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:15,553
<i>Halfway through,</i>

764
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,088
<i>the courses will merge,</i>

765
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:19,423
<i>and you'll cross monkey bars in a circle.</i>

766
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:24,495
<i>In the second half,</i>
<i>there will be three types of courses.</i>

767
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:29,133
<i>Your arm strength and agility</i>
<i>will be tested in the Seesaw Course.</i>

768
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:33,571
<i>Your shoulder strength</i>
<i>will be tested in the Pedal Course.</i>

769
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:38,309
<i>Your agility will help you regain ground</i>
<i>in the Tarzan Course.</i>

770
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:40,978
<i>Consider your options,</i>

771
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,414
<i>and choose the course</i>
<i>where you will excel.</i>

772
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:45,349
<i>How you judge your abilities,</i>

773
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:49,253
<i>will play a major role</i>
<i>in the outcome of this challenge.</i>

774
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,523
<i>Also, if at any point you fall,</i>

775
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,793
<i>you can rejoin the competition</i>
<i>by climbing the rope ladder.</i>

776
00:39:56,761 --> 00:40:01,065
<i>Finally, your ranking will be determined</i>
<i>by how much time it takes you</i>

777
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,633
<i>to finish this challenge,</i>

778
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,336
<i>so aim to reach the goal quickly.</i>

779
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:07,405
The gymnasts will rock this.

780
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:09,306
Seriously, this is built for gymnasts.

781
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:10,474
I'm excited.

782
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,410
Finally, it's something I'm good at.

783
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,147
I've actually competed
on the horizontal bars before,

784
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:17,581
so I feel pretty confident.

785
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,051
Masato also has
a ton of upper body strength.

786
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:23,821
This challenge seems like
something I'd be good at.

787
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,556
I think I can succeed here.

788
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:28,359
I am super confident, yeah.

789
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,428
<i>In this stage,</i>

790
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,963
<i>you'll be competing against…</i>

791
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:36,400
<i>those you grouped up with.</i>

792
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:37,501
What?

793
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,003
That's how it's gonna be.

794
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:40,571
So we're not a team?

795
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:42,540
So we're just competing
against each other?

796
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,808
This is cruel.

797
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:45,643
We're up against each other.

798
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:48,345
It's a shame to be eliminating
our group members.

799
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:52,349
<i>The first three competitors</i>
<i>to finish will move on.</i>

800
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:56,287
<i>The last one to finish will be eliminated.</i>

801
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,324
<i>Please demonstrate good judgment</i>
<i>in your abilities.</i>

802
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:03,661
<i>Your future depends on</i>
<i>split-second decisions.</i>

803
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:06,263
- So that's how this is gonna go.
- It's so cruel.

804
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,499
Onikura, Hayasaka, and Mita.

805
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:12,369
I think these three are pretty elite
in terms of their explosive power,

806
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:16,006
so I might've joined the wrong team.

807
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:17,775
- Hey, Yone.
- Yone.

808
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:20,177
- We have Yone.
- Come on, stop!

809
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:21,779
Yone.

810
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:23,280
It's a challenge I'll be good at.

811
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:25,883
In judo, we start by grabbing
the opponent's judogi

812
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,084
in order to land a move.

813
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:31,288
So our grip strength is very important.
I think I might be pretty good at this.

814
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:34,558
I'm aiming for a number one ranking.

815
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,494
This is gonna be tough.

816
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:39,196
"It's gonna be like that?" is how I felt.

817
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,232
I thought I joined an amazing team,

818
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:43,834
but it turns out it was
the worst team I could have joined.

819
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,904
<i>Furthermore, in this next stage,</i>

820
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:49,306
<i>of the 15 athletes who survive,</i>

821
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:51,909
<i>whoever finishes with the slowest time</i>

822
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:53,277
<i>will be eliminated.</i>

823
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,778
- Brutal.
- That's six total.

824
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:55,679
Six of us?

825
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:56,814
Fourteen move on.

826
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:59,583
<i>I feel the rush of blood</i>
<i>Going over my head</i>

827
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,652
<i>The first round is about to begin.</i>

828
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,854
<i>There's no more going back</i>
<i>Ahead… </i>

829
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,589
<i>Kenta Tsukamoto,</i>

830
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,057
<i>Yoshio Itoi,</i>

831
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:08,626
<i>Akira Kaji,</i>

832
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:10,060
<i>and Kouzi.</i>

833
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:15,099
I'm not confident.

834
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:19,169
In soccer, you primarily use your legs.
You don't use your arms much, you know?

835
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,139
But two on my team are a little heavier.

836
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,074
Itoi and Tsukamoto.

837
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:28,579
I wanna go faster than them,
and I think I have a chance.

838
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:30,481
I want to advance, whatever it takes.

839
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:32,883
I have to advance since I'm lighter.

840
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:36,020
Among the four of us,
I'm sure I'm the lightest.

841
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:39,623
If I do my best, it'll mean
kicking Sai out of the competition.

842
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:42,726
I'm gonna miss him, poor guy.

843
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:45,162
Baby Sai, little Sai.

844
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,565
I like that guy.
He's like a brother to me.

845
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:50,034
I don't see any way
that Sai can win at this.

846
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,404
Well, for me,
this competition is gonna be critical.

847
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,507
If I lose at this stage,
I'll be super disappointed.

848
00:42:56,574 --> 00:43:00,477
Everyone is thinking,
"Kenta is at a huge disadvantage."

849
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:02,313
I wanna prove them wrong.

850
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:03,547
I'm pretty nervous.

851
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:06,584
But I just have to do it. That's it.

852
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,519
I'll give it my all!

853
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:12,423
<i>At the sound of the buzzer, begin.</i>

854
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,992
<i>I feel my heart pumping</i>

855
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:17,061
<i>And I'm filled with dread</i>

856
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:21,632
<i>There’s no more going back</i>
<i>Ahead, I’m led by fire</i>

857
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:24,134
- Wow, Itoi.
- He's skipping every two rungs.

858
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:27,304
- His arms are long!
- His arms are so long.

859
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:29,473
- He's huge!
- He's massive.

860
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,741
Whoa!

861
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,210
- What?!
- What's going on?
