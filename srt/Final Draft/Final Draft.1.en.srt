00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,549
<i>The stretch from the merge</i>
<i>up to the goal was extremely difficult.</i>

GOSON SAKAI, 28

173
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:18,517
No way.

174
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,754
This is killer.

175
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,423
And still so far to go?

176
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,393
Just so crazy.

177
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,262
Feels like this hill never ends.

178
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,664
And it's way too steep.

179
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,400
There's more?!

180
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,736
At one point, I looked up

181
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,471
and felt hopeless.

182
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,406
<i>This is completely messed up.</i>

183
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,675
<i>Am I really running up this hill?</i>

184
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:43,809
TEMPERATURE: 0℃
SLOPE: 27°

185
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,745
Wait. Where's the goal?

186
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,346
Not even close, huh?

187
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,283
<i>At one point, I felt completely crushed.</i>

188
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:01,027
Whoever makes it to the top first
must be in great shape, really amazing.

189
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,330
<i>The hardest part was the pace.</i>
<i>It was too fast for me.</i>

190
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:08,200
<i>So whoever is leading the way</i>
<i>at this point likely can't be caught.</i>

191
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,202
CURRENTLY 1ST PLACE:

192
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,041
<i>I used to be a professional soccer player.</i>

193
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:15,941
<i>That was my sport.</i>

194
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,744
<i>I was always moving,</i>
<i>running for most of the game.</i>

195
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,814
<i>So I've got great endurance</i>
<i>and can stay active for a long time.</i>

196
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,917
<i>After retiring,</i>
<i>I opened my own coffee shop.</i>

197
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:26,986
<i>But my income dropped,</i>

198
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:30,122
<i>and I'm only earning a third</i>
<i>of what I used to make as a soccer player.</i>

199
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,391
<i>It's been tough, and on top of all that,</i>

200
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,027
<i>I got married and had a baby.</i>

201
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,463
<i>So that means our funds</i>
<i>have been super tight.</i>

202
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:41,467
<i>I wanna use the prize money</i>
<i>to expand my business.</i>

203
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:45,271

216
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:42,128
<i>Until junior high,</i>
<i>I was playing baseball on the boys' teams.</i>

217
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,997
<i>I was frustrated that I could</i>

00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:53,172

Man.

224
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,282
This looks good.

225
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,584

MARTIAL ARTS FIGHTER

This isn't cheating.

228
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,564
The rules didn't say we couldn't do that.

229
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,533
I'm feeling unmotivated.

230
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,369
I was drinking until three this morning.

231
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,805
I think those who retire are idiots,
to be honest.

MAKING A BOLD ENTRY
AS THE ONLY ACTIVE ATHLETE

233
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,308
I don't know why people retire.

ANNUAL FIGHT EARNINGS
SOMETIMES EXCEED 100 MILLION YEN

235
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,479
It's pretty foolish to give up
on making that money.

236
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,649
I believe athletes
should always strive to earn money.

237
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:39,251
That can inspire younger generations.

238
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:41,654
Nobody's here.

So desperate. You know?

249
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:07,580

So fast.

00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,046
I'm Atsushi Arai,

261
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:43,182
and I play water polo.

262
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,952
I played on Japan's national team
for ten years,

263
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,356
and with that team,
I competed in the Olympics twice.

264
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:53,959
But water polo isn't that popular
of a sport.

265
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:59,098
I want more people to know how strong
water polo players actually are.

266
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:05,070
And I really don't want to lose
to athletes from more popular sports.

267
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:11,644
Oh!

268
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,948
When he tripped a little
on the hill, unexpectedly,

269
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,616
and he slowed down,

270
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:20,452
I thought, "Oh, I can make a move."

271
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,392
I'm passing.

That's how I approached my entire career

Let's go.

325
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:13,325
For me, perseverance is all I have,
my greatest strength.

326
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,693
So I will persist.

327
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,931
When I won a gold medal at the Olympics,
I never quit, never gave up.

328
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:21,934
No matter what happens,
I can't lose that determination.

329
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,770
I saw another female athlete
coming up the hill behind me.

330
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:28,941
I knew that I wanted to be first,
among the female competitors.

331
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,476
I was deeply committed to that.

332
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,345
I worked as hard as I could
to stay ahead of her.

333
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,647
And for all the male athletes competing,

334
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:38,584
I wanted to remind them
how great wrestling is.

335
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,152
It's an amazing sport.

336
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:46,558
I felt determined to show them
how strong wrestlers are.

337
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,961
That kept me fired up
all the way to the gate.

338
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,264
Brutal.

<i>that someone was still behind me.</i>

363
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:06,038

I can't see anyone.

370
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,457
Damn, I'm last.

371
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,064
So far to go.

372

Man, my calves…

373
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,308

(17 YEARS OLD)

<i>…I was selected first pick overall.</i>

377
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:57,489
<i>But I was released twice</i>
<i>without ever pitching in the major league.</i>

378
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:58,957
<i>So I decided to retire.</i>

379
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,494
Come on, legs.

380
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:06,665

<i>and ultimately</i>

384
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,993
Damn it!

385
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,561
I must finish this.

386
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:42,534
<i>To be honest, this was the first time</i>
<i>I experienced humiliation. You know,</i>

387
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,569
<i>I started playing rugby when I was three.</i>

388
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,472
<i>I was selected</i>
<i>for Japan's high school national team.</i>

389
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:48,807
<i>And soon after,</i>

390
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,610
<i>I earned a spot representing Japan</i>
<i>as a bodybuilder.</i>

391
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:55,480
<i>I've never really had to chase others</i>
<i>to succeed.</i>

392
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,983
<i>I've never had to dig in</i>
<i>and fight to catch up.</i>

393
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,584
<i>I'd never experienced that.</i>

394
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:01,186
I wanna stay.

00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:03,855
FATHER: TAKAFUMI-SAN

396
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:07,092
<i>When I was in elementary school,</i>
<i>I made a promise to my father.</i>

397
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,661
<i>I dreamed that I'd make</i>
<i>Japan's national rugby team,</i>

398
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,830
<i>and I promised him he'd watch me play.</i>

399
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:16,368
<i>But then one day, out of the blue,</i>
<i>I was diagnosed with a brain condition.</i>

400
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:17,836
<i>I was forced to retire that day.</i>

401
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,706
<i>I didn't even get to play in</i>
<i>what would have been my final tournament.</i>

402
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:25,010
<i>So today, I just can't give up again.</i>

403
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:29,214
<i>It's the last thing I wanna do.</i>

404
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:33,318
I can't give up.

405
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,699
Just a little more.

406
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:52,037
So close.

407
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:54,272

<i>The race is officially over.</i>

- <i>The first competitor has been eliminated.</i>

00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,574
I have to finish.

414
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:45,624
<i>So many people supported me being here.</i>

415
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,892
ELIMINATED

420
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,084
<i>It was such a weird-looking room.</i>

421
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:14,953
<i>Very intriguing.</i>

424
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,470
- Nerve-wracking.
- I'm nervous.

425
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,873
- Like, I've only met one other person.
- Yeah, same here.

426
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,243
I have no idea who else is involved.

427
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,479
Makes you wonder
how many of us there really are.

428
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:41,546
Right, right.

429
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:45,383
<i>Then the ones who came in third and fourth</i>
<i>came into the room,</i>

430
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,652
<i>then fifth and sixth, and so on.</i>

431
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:48,787
- Great race.
- Great race.

432
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,322
It's so white.

6TH PLACE RYUDAI ONIKURA, 30
FORMER AMATEUR BOXER

434
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,658
I'm Ryudai Onikura.

435
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:55,060
I used to be a boxer.

436
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:59,164
After I lost the final match
in the Olympic qualifiers, I retired.

437
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:03,535
Currently, I earn my living
as a professional actor.

438
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,937
I have a long way to go.

439
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:10,375
I'm hoping that I can regain my confidence
I once had as a boxer

440
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:13,144
and show everyone what I'm made of
in<i>Final Draft</i>.

441
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:16,882
- Hello.
- Hey there.

442
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:19,284
Nice to meet you. I'm Kurihara.

443
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:20,952
Kevin.

444
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,521
It's been a long time.

445
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:24,322
It's been ages.

446
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:25,590
Yes, it's been ages.

447
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:26,491
Kevin.

448
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:27,659
What a surprise.

449
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:28,693
I was shocked.

450
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,863
I didn't expect him to be participating
in<i>Final Draft</i>.

451
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,332
It's like I'm facing my greatest enemy.

452
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,302
At one point,
he took part in a training camp

453
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,337
for Japan's national rugby team.

454
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:43,542
Ever since then,
I could tell the guy was an elite athlete.

455
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:44,743
It's Kurihara.

456
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:49,414
I watch clips of his workouts
on social media with my family.

457
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:53,018
So I definitely feel honored to get
the chance to compete with that guy.

458
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:58,456
I saw Kurihara competing
in a bobsledding competition as well.

459
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:01,493
<i>I believe</i>
<i>he's one of Japan's premier athletes</i>

460
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,328
<i>in terms of physical ability.</i>

461
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:04,996
<i>But, of course,</i>

462
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,065
I just refuse to lose to him.

463
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,635
- You're so tan.
- You mean me? For sure.

464
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:12,103
Oh.

465
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,438
- Hello.
- Hello there.

466
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:14,773
- Hey there.
- Hey, guys.

467
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,041
- Welcome.
- What's up?

468
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:19,911
<i>I was taken aback</i>
<i>by all the incredible athletes walking in.</i>

469
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,280
<i>There was a phenomenal soccer player</i>

470
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:24,182
<i>and great athletes from other sports.</i>

471
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,317
Hello!

472
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,753
<i>I felt so small in comparison.</i>

473
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:32,657
Wow, so many crazy people here.

474
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,459
You're the craziest.

475
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:38,096
At my peak, people called me superhuman.

476
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:42,334
I'm confident in my physical ability
to win this competition.

477
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:45,904
After retirement,
I've struggled to find something

478
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,305
that motivates me.

479
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:48,840
So I came here to win it all.

480
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:49,808
2022: RETIRED

481
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:53,445
I'm hoping it will inspire me
and reignite my superhuman spirit.

482
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:56,681
I want to at least beat Itoi.

483
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:59,217
<i>I wanna defeat a superhuman.</i>

484
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:01,486
I was super surprised.

485
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:03,488
Damn, you were fast.

486
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:04,556
- What?
- Eh?

487
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,457
What?

488
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:08,393
There's so many.

489
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:10,762
<i>I was the oldest there.</i>

490
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:12,631
As an older guy,

491
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,433
I don't wanna lose
to people younger than me.

492
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:17,569
What kind of sport do you play?

493
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:20,538
- Great race.
- Yeah, great race.

494
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,007
Hello. Great race.

495
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,476
I'm a former professional judo athlete.

496
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:26,344
My name is Katsuma Yonemura.

497
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:27,579
At the moment,

498
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,481
I'm training to be a barber.

499
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,951
- Hence the haircut?
- He clearly cut it himself.

500
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,354
<i>I work at a barber shop,</i>

501
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:39,557
<i>so I want to use the prize money</i>
<i>to support my new profession.</i>

502
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:44,462
<i>Ultimately, If I can raise enough money,</i>
<i>I wanna open my own shop.</i>

503
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,633
<i>No matter how hard I fall,</i>
<i>I'm determined to get back up.</i>

504
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:52,337
<i>I'm definitely leaving</i>
<i>with the prize money. All of it.</i>

505
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:55,473
Hello.

506
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,709
- Hi there.
- Hey!

507
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,310
Let's have some fun together.

508
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:01,112
- Champion! Champion!
- Hello.

509
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,715
I was like, "A world champion is here."

510
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:06,951
Well, I've always liked
Hozumi Hasegawa, so…

511
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,887
Damn, I was so excited.

512
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:13,324
He's, like, the whole reason
I started boxing in the first place.

513
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:15,527
I would always mimic that counterpunch.

514
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,962
Which counter punch? There's so many.

515
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:25,203
Hello. Nice to meet you all.

516
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,338
I'm Koji Tokuda, a former football player

517
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:28,707
and former comedian.

518
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:30,108
- Thank you for having me.
- Welcome.

519
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,009
Thank you.

520
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,311
I was like, "It's Koji."

521
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,514
He was one of my teammates
from college football in the US.

522
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:38,516
VICE CAPTAIN: TAKASHI KURIHARA
CAPTAIN: KOJI TOKUDA

523
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,752
We also played professional football
for a season.

524
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:42,954
We became very close friends.

525
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,156
I was thrilled to see him. Yeah.

526
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,092
I'm getting fired up. Yeah.

527
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:48,893
I was on<i>Blouson Chiemi with B</i>.

528
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,930
That was my television debut
as a professional comedian.

529
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,133
<i>I wanna show that I haven't lost</i>
<i>my abilities as an athlete</i>

530
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,469
<i>by competing in</i>Final Draft<i>.</i>

531
00:28:57,969 --> 00:28:59,270
Hello. Nice to meet you.

532
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:01,406
My name is Miyaguni.

533
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,608
FORMER PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL PLAYER

534
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:07,412
Miyaguni used to play for the Giants
as a pitcher.

535
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:10,582
We've played against each other.
Quite a few times, actually.

536
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,251
Also, a female player.

537
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:14,152
Great work, all.

538
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:16,054
I'm Yu Kato.

539
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:19,224
I used to be
a professional women's baseball player.

540
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:24,996
I dreamed of joining Japan's national team
when I was little.

541
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:29,100
I tried out three different times,
but every time I tried out, I failed.

542
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:32,937
After that, the professional league
I played in was discontinued,

543
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:35,373
and I sort of just felt
burnt out by it all.

544
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,544
My dream is to live in a small house
and raise a small family.

545
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,914
So I'd like to use the prize money
to support that dream.

546
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:47,485
I'm Masato.
My sport is called street workout.

547
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:48,419
Street what?

548
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:51,990
You may have seen it on TikTok.
We make it look like we're walking on air.

549
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:53,591
Oh!

550
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:55,126
- The iron bar?
- Yeah.

551
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:56,828
As long as there's a floor, I can do it.

552
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:58,563
- What?
- Go.

553
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,198
Oh!

554
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,603
- Amazing.
- Awesome.

555
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:12,544
Amazing.

556
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,350
Wait, what?

557
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,486
- Wait, what?
- Oh!

558
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:22,821
Hello.

559
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,957
I'm Kouzi, a martial artist.

560
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:28,326
Then Kouzi walked in.

561
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,662
His energy was exactly how I imagined.

562
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:33,031
I was like, "Whoa, seriously?"
I was shocked.

563
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,532
I wanted his autograph.

564
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:38,436
There was a girl hiking the mountain
behind me who was cheering for me.

565
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,337
- What?
- Really?

566
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,539
- If she was behind you, then…
- She's not here yet.

567
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,074
I only showed up to meet her.

568
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:48,413
Great job, everyone.

569
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:51,850
23RD PLACE: TOMOE TAMURA, 34

570
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:54,118
FORMER MEMBER OF
THE JAPAN NATIONAL ULTIMATE FRISBEE TEAM

571
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,187
She's the reason I was able to finish.

572
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,123
- Thank you so much.
- Of course, thank you.

573
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:02,994
Wow, this is amazing.

574
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:05,029
- So big.
- Dude, you're jacked.

575
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:07,098
- Look at this guy.
- Check out the size of his arms.

576
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,399
You're gigantic.

577
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:09,634
Oof!

578
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,236
He looks like a pro fighter.

579
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,972
Hi. My name is Tsukamoto,

580
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,374
and I'm
a professional physique competitor.

581
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:19,611
And I am ranked first in Japan
and fifth in the world.

582
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:21,212
Wow, that's amazing.

583
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,715
You're the guy
with the largest pecs in Japan, right?

584
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,583
Yep. That's me.

585
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,885
- Insane.
- Watch this.

586
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,890
Crazy, crazy. That's wild<i>.</i>

587
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:34,959
I never want to lose,
especially not to someone that big.

588
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,895
I mean, he's just showing off.

589
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:40,965
I want to prove
that my body is a better representation

590
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,401
of what it means
to do proper strength training.

591
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:46,704
- Everyone here is great.
- Twenty-four of us.

592
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:56,180
<i>Next up is the Pink Stage.</i>

593
00:31:56,681 --> 00:32:00,084
<i>Here we will test your perseverance.</i>

594
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:01,986
Perseverance.

595
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:04,188
- Seriously?
- Gonna push us to the limit.

596
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:08,860
<i>Everyone, please stand up</i>
<i>and proceed to the stage.</i>

597
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,095
Already? No way.

598
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,666
<i>I'm pretty anxious about whatever's next.</i>

599
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:17,735
I have absolutely no idea what to expect.

600
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:19,637
<i>Seriously, this is scary.</i>

601
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:21,472
<i>Honestly, I'm nervous.</i>

602
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:24,709
<i>I just feel really excited.</i>
<i>I'm looking forward to it.</i>

603
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,144
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

604
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,445
This is gonna be crazy.

605
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,254
We're here.

606
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,089
- Wow.
- Really?

607
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,159
- Here we go. Here we go.
- Hmm?

608
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:42,160
What?

609
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,296
- Okay, wait. What?
- Wait. Really?

610
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:49,500
It looks scary.

611
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,669
This is so scary.

612
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:53,738
It looks incredibly steep.

613
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:54,739
What is this?

614
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:56,975
Wow, this is super steep.

615
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,377
- This is crazy.
- I'm freaking out.

616
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:03,181
<i>This is the Pink Stage,</i>
<i>testing your perseverance.</i>

617
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:05,416
<i>All of you will be doing sit-ups</i>

618
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,987
<i>until you've completely maxed out.</i>

619
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:10,922
- That's tough.
- Crazy.

620
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:16,094
- This angle is tough.
- Can I even do this?

621
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:21,165
<i>Place your feet</i>
<i>under the bars, and lie back on the slide.</i>

622
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:22,667
I see what we're doing.

623
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,471
<i>Perform a sit-up</i>
<i>within five seconds of hearing the buzzer,</i>

624
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,906
<i>pushing the button with your forehead.</i>

625
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,576
So I can't do it at my own pace.

626
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,079
<i>If you fail</i>
<i>to hit the button with your head</i>

627
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:36,647
<i>before the next buzzer,</i>

628
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:38,716
<i>the bar will automatically release.</i>

629
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:41,386
<i>You'll go down the slide,</i>
<i>and you'll be eliminated.</i>

630
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:46,524
<i>This is your chance</i>
<i>to showcase your perseverance.</i>

631
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:48,059
<i>The drive to get back up,</i>

632
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,161
<i>no matter how many times</i>
<i>you're knocked down.</i>

633
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:52,997
I feel like I need
some extra perseverance.

634
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:55,767
Sticking with something
even when it hurts is so hard.

635
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,335
It's gonna be tough,

636
00:33:57,835 --> 00:33:59,871
but I've faced challenges before.

637
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:03,541
<i>Remember,</i>
<i>the higher you place in the Pink Stage,</i>

638
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:04,942
<i>the more points you'll earn,</i>

639
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,378
<i>giving you an advantage</i>
<i>in the stages to come.</i>

640
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:12,950
<i>Also, the number of contestants</i>
<i>being eliminated is…</i>

641
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:16,854
<i>…four.</i>

642
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,556
- What?
- Dang, four people?!

643
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,324
- Wow, that's a lot.
- No way.

644
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,261
I was shocked when I heard "four people."

645
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:24,796
I was like, "That many people?!"

646
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:26,798
If I lose here, people are gonna think

647
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:29,500
bodybuilders' muscles
are completely useless.

648
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,035
I can't lose this one.

649
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:32,737
<i>All contestants,</i>

650
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:35,273
<i>please prepare to begin.</i>

651
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,847
As a soccer player,
I've always had a strong core.

652
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,249
The angle is pretty steep,
so I'm not sure what will happen,

653
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:47,185
but I don't think I'll lose.

654
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:52,590
As a former boxer,
I don't wanna lose doing sit-ups.

655
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,259
The guy to the right of me
is Hozumi Hasegawa,

656
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:56,461
a boxer I really admire,

657
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:59,363
so I'm gonna do my best
to at least beat him.

658
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:01,732
Sometimes I have serious back pain,

659
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:04,102
so I have a hard time
doing a lot of crunches.

660
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:08,072
Honestly, this will probably be
the toughest challenge for me.

661
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:12,076
<i>I was able to defeat some of the men</i>
<i>climbing the mountain in the first round,</i>

662
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:14,979
<i>so, of course,</i>
<i>I wanna outlast some of them,</i>

663
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,048
<i>and beat a few of the men again.</i>

664
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,685
There are so many amazing athletes.

665
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,754
But once again,
I want to prove to everyone

666
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,257
that water polo players are elite.

667
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:27,925
I wanna show people

668
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:30,328
how strong water polo makes us.

669
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,597
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

670
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,301
<i>Five seconds.</i>

671
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:56,053
<i>The challenge was</i>
<i>extremely demanding physically.</i>

672
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:58,256
<i>Because of the slope,</i>

673
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,725
<i>it felt completely different</i>
<i>than regular crunches.</i>

674
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,739
<i>I felt like</i>
<i>the gaps made it more challenging</i>

675
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:16,440
<i>because I couldn't go at my own pace,</i>

676
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,743
<i>and sometimes the wait stressed me out.</i>

677
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,115
<i>This is easy for me.</i>

678
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,558
<i>Ten reps.</i>

679
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:03,988
- What?
- What?

680
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,289
- Hold on. What?
- Huh?

681
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:07,358
Wait, why?

682
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:09,827
What?

683
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,095
ELIMINATED

684
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:12,263
I touched it.

685
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,164
I guess,

686
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:14,498
when I went up,

687
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:19,170
it's possible that my forehead
didn't push the button hard enough.

688
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,340
The sensor didn't pick it up, so…

689
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,509
I'm shocked that my challenge ended

690
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:30,214
before I even had the chance
to give it my best shot.

691
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:37,822
Well,

692
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:41,392
I can say
that my family was so supportive of me.

693
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:44,895
I mean, I feel bad for letting them down.

694
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,335
I'm so disappointed. Yeah.

695
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:56,007
<i>Three more people will be eliminated.</i>

696
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:58,843
- Must've not pushed it.
- I get it.

697
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:02,880
Oops. Close one.

698
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:06,250
At first, I thought I reached the button,

699
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:07,518
but I missed it.

700
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:11,055
So I had to do it again,
and from there, it got really difficult.

701
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:30,241
What? No way. Really?

702
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,275
What? No way.

703
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,512
What? Really?

704
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:38,683
<i>I guess the button didn't light up.</i>
<i>I didn't press it all the way.</i>

705
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,887
<i>Two more people will be eliminated.</i>

706
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,159
Oops! That was close.

707
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:55,766
I'd say after about 20 crunches,
I started feeling it in my back,

708
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,101
and it got painful.

709
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,905
Still, what helped me were
the five-second gaps between reps.

710
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:03,741
So I could lie down and rest,
even just for a few seconds.

711
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:06,110
And in that time,
I could release some of the pain

712
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,945
that was building up in my back.

713
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:20,524
<i>Thirty reps.</i>

714
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,370
<i>I mean, my ab muscles</i>
<i>were completely exhausted.</i>

715
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,672
<i>Five seconds felt like two seconds.</i>

716
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:11,742
I was
just completely physically unprepared.

717
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,612
I guess I realized
that I'm just a regular person.

718
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,819
<i>One more person will be eliminated.</i>

719
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,058
<i>At around 20 crunches,</i>

720
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,694
<i>I felt like</i>
<i>it was getting extremely difficult.</i>

721
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:37,435
I was determined
not to be the last one eliminated.

722
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,103
That's all I was thinking.

723
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:44,074
In order to repeatedly toss the Frisbee
long distances during an ultimate game,

724
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,609
I have to have a strong core.

725
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,711
I've worked those muscles a lot,

726
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,013
so I felt confident.

727
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,753
<i>I think that this time,</i>

728
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:59,890
<i>for this challenge, I couldn't stop,</i>
<i>and I had to give everything I had.</i>

729
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,376
<i>Forty reps.</i>

730
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,645
<i>I thought I'd reached my limit.</i>

731
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,948
<i>I still had a lot of strength.</i>

732
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:26,317
<i>I can't lose, no matter what.</i>

733
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:28,552
<i>Come on! Do it!</i>
