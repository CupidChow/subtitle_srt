00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:21,721
- That's good. He's fast.
- Yeah.

3
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,990
- Nice job.
- Ah, damn!

4
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:26,393
- Ah, it's so hard.
- What?!

5
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:28,795
It's not a good idea
to climb up without a plan.

6
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:31,398
And it's like that
so you can't slide under it.

7
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:34,534
- You can't slide under there.
- That's the problem.

8
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,369
You gotta climb to get to the other side.

9
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:53,586
<i>Ryudai Onikura,</i>
<i>please proceed to the competition arena.</i>

10
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:57,057
The mystery fighter
has to be getting pretty tired by now.

11
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:59,993
So I think I stand an even better chance.

12
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:19,946
Wow, that was close.

13
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,849
You get trapped and you're screwed.
You can't move anywhere.

14
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,819
- Hard to move on the edges.
- You get stuck.

15
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,088
There's so much to think about,

16
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:31,157
like the best way to get over
each obstacle you run into.

17
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,760
This is an extremely difficult challenge.

18
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:36,729
<i>Yoshio Itoi.</i>

19
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:38,164
Wow, it's tight.

20
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,133
I'm the sixth one to compete.

21
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:44,170
So the fighter has already
been at it for a few rounds.

22
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,240
He must be exhausted at this point.

23
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:51,311
So, of course,
I think I have a decent chance to win.

24
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:53,213
I'll just have to figure it out.

25
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,035
<i>The winner is the fighter.</i>

26
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,672

That's good.

33
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,573
- He's fast.
- He's got it.

34
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,008
- There!
- So fast.

35
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,311
- He's close!
- Whoa!

36
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,946
Whoa! He almost made it!

- What? How long was that?
- <i>The winner is the fighter.</i>

38
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,818
I mean, I knew Kurihara was fast.

39
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,687

- He's getting tired.
- Yeah.

43
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,117
For sure. This isn't
an easy sport to do for long stretches,

44
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:40,720
so he doesn't have a lot of stamina left.

- <i>The winner is the fighter.</i>

50
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:10,683
- It's hard to know where to go.
- He was close. What a shame.

51
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,884
He's fast.

52
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:17,690
Look, he's tired for sure.
It hurts to breathe.

That was a good fight just now.

59
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:53,126

- It's crazy. They're all over.
- He's all scratched up.

I can't think straight anymore.

68
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,532
- Well, he's getting slower.
- Yeah, I think he's losing speed.

69

Ugh, I screwed up.

87
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,735
There it is. Twisted his ankle.

88
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,471
Ouch!

89
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,612

That brought back a lot of memories.

99
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,114
You know, as an athlete,

100
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,817
I think most people assume

101
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,720
that everything was just smooth sailing
for me,

102
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,790
going from playing football
to doing bobsled.

103
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,892
But that's not true at all.

104
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:18,564
I retired before I was able to achieve…

105
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,667
AIMED TO BECOME
THE FIRST JAPANESE PLAYER IN THE NFL

106
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,337
…any of the dreams I had as an athlete.

107
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,373
So this time…

108
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:33,179
when I got this opportunity,

109
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:39,385
I never thought
I would… have another chance to win again

110
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,555
after I officially retired from sports.

111
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:45,925
And even in this moment,

112
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,494
winning is all I can think about.

113
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,866
I can't even think about
giving up right now.

114
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,435
It's just, you know…

115
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,773
It's gonna be harder.

116
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:06,612
That was a pretty tough challenge,
sure, but so were the others.

117
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,247
I'll overcome it

118
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:10,650
somehow.

- You all right?
- I'm all right.

123
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:31,337
I think you're
in good enough shape to join the others.

124
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,705
- Okay.
- Good luck, okay?

125
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,307

- Hey there.
- Oh no.

129
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,150
No, no, no, it's fine.

130
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,853
- So how's the pain when you step on it?
- It's okay.

131
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,221
Does it hurt?

132
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,891
I'm sorry about this.

133
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,661
- No, it's okay.
- Sorry that I caused everyone to worry.

134
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,131
I'll be fine. I'll do my best, as always.

135
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:03,235
We'll keep fighting.
I'm going to keep fighting to win,

136
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:04,637
and I hope you do too.

137
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,640
For real. I'm still in it,
with everything I've got.

138
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:09,775
Let's try one more time.

139
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:11,477
Together,

140
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,079
we keep fighting.

141
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:15,114
- Let's do this.
- Let's do it.

142
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,184
I think, for most athletes,

143
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,620
you can tell
how long someone's been competing

144
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,557
by watching how they put their weight
on their feet. So I think it's pretty bad.

145
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,492
But he's so positive about it.

146
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,495
He says he's gonna keep competing,
even with a sprained ankle.

147
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,364
So I admire his mental strength.

148
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:33,699
That's good, I think.

149
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:37,970
No way!

150
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:41,273
- You're walking normally.
- This is amazing. I can walk just fine.

151
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,676
<i>Hearing him say</i>

152
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:49,015
<i>he'll compete through the injury,</i>
<i>even though he's basically on one foot,</i>

153
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,750

154
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,322
Okay.

155
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,357
I'm all right. Let's go.

156
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,230
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>We will now resume the Purple Stage.</i>

Boxing.

165
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,498
If I'm unpredictable,
I should be able to tag him.

166
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,767
I don't need to knock him out.

167
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,670
So I think I've got a good chance.

00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,295
Yuya got hit. It's 0 to 1.

176
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,671
- Oh, nice. Good one.
- They both got one hit?

177
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,106
It's 1 to 1 now.

178
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:22,842
Yuya's doing good.

179
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:28,848
Yeah, his sporadic movement
is hard for a boxer to predict.

180
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,456
This looks so tough.

181
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:13,292
Look, they're getting tired.
They're both getting tired.

182
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:29,542
- The longer they fight, the better for us.
- Yeah, I want Yamanaka tired out.

183
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:30,609
For sure.

184
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,495
- Oh man.
- Incredible.

185
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,499
- Whoa!
- Whoa! What!?

186
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:54,667
Amazing.

187
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,538
<i>The winner is the challenger.</i>

188
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:05,678
Thank you.

189
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:08,547
Thank you.

190
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,618
I feel like I got lucky.

191
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,421
Knowing that there are
four more people behind me,

192
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:19,325
I thought to myself, "If I lose this,
that'll definitely be the end for me."

193
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:21,460
When I had that thought,

194
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,829
I saw Yamanaka's waist button.

195
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,664
It was pretty far away.

196
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:30,002
At that moment, I had to act fast,
and I took a bit of a risk.

197
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,404
I lunged forward and tapped it.

198
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,881
<i>The second competitor</i>
<i>to advance to the final stage is</i>

199
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,149
<i>Yuya Shozui.</i>

200
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:47,953
Oh man.

201
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,458
<i>The finalists have been determined.</i>

202
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:56,862
<i>However,</i>

203
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:01,033
<i>the Purple Stage is not over yet.</i>

204
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,434
- What?
- What?

205
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:03,969
Wait, wait.

206
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:07,773
<i>The remaining competitors</i>
<i>will compete against each other</i>

207
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,875
<i>for one final spot.</i>

208
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,611
- Seriously?
- Good, good, good, good, good.

209
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:17,416
So we have one more chance to advance.

210
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,988
It feels like…
I'm just barely hanging on by a thread.

211
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,958
- What do you think?
- Yeah, I get it.

212
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,561
Wow.

213
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,263
- Wow.
- What?!

214
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,531
Wait a minute.

215
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,066
- It's huge.
- Whoa.

216
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,768
- Amazing.
- Incredible.

217
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,469
This is so freakin' big.

218
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,371
- Wow.
- So it's about power.

219
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,175
<i>The challenge to decide the last finalist…</i>

220
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:49,214
<i>is Megaball Sumo.</i>

221
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,783
- Bring it on.
- Sumo?

222
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,819
<i>Whoever pushes the ball from the center</i>

223
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:56,055
<i>onto their opponent's side wins.</i>

224
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:02,695
<i>Now, this challenge will be structured</i>
<i>as a one-on-one tournament.</i>

225
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,496
- Tournament.
- A tournament.

226
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:07,333
<i>The presenter</i>
<i>who scored highest will go first.</i>

227
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,568
<i>Takashi Kurihara,</i>

228
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:14,039
<i>please choose the opponent</i>
<i>you wish to fight in the first round.</i>

229
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,408
Eh?

230
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,310
So we get to choose.

231
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,446
YOSHIO ITOI, 43

232
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,147
KATSUMA YONEMURA, 28
FORMER JUDO ATHLETE

233
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,585
- Yonemura. I choose you.
- Yes!

234
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,853
Okay.

235
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,190
Let's go!

236
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:34,259
If we hadn't competed as teammates
in the Orange Stage,

237
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,463
I'd feel better
about being chosen to battle him first.

238
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,099
But Kurihara told us

239
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,634
that all of us have to try our best,

240
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,536
so I'll do my best

241
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,039
to defeat him and advance.

242
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:51,110
<i>This means Ryudai Onikura</i>

243
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:55,714
<i>and Yoshio Itoi will battle</i>
<i>in the second fight.</i>

244
00:16:56,615 --> 00:17:03,022
<i>The first fight is between</i>
<i>Takashi Kurihara and Katsuma Yonemura.</i>

245
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:20,439
Bring it on!

246
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,175
Whoo!

247
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,847
What will Yone's plan be?

248
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,015
I don't know.

249
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:33,519
It's tough to be injured
in a one-on-one battle, obviously.

250
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,654
<i>Attention.</i>

251
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,657
<i>At the sound of the buzzer,</i>
<i>begin the battle.</i>

252
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,803
- Wow.
- I knew he'd be that strong.

253
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,505
Damn.

254
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:56,842
He's at the slope.

255
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,578
- Move to the side.
- He's still on his feet.

256
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,838
Like I said, the slope is an advantage.

257
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,108
If it's drawn out,
it'll be tough for Takashi.

258
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,757
He shifted it. This isn't good.

259
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,129
Oh, just a bit more.

260
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,267
This is great. Seriously.

261
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:14,186
- This is gonna be a long fight.
- It definitely will be.

262
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:23,896
Oh.

263
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,099
That's not good.

264
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,075
It'll be hard to push it
all the way up the slope.

265
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:39,912
Because the slope gives you an advantage.

266
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:41,380
- It does, yeah.
- Yeah.

267
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,297
Yonemura won't give up.

268
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,998
- He's pretty strong.
- Yeah.

269
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:09,875
It's taking a while.

270
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,511
His legs are amazing.

271
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:13,912
Wow.

272
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,616
He's not normal. He's superhuman.

273
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,839
<i>Five minutes have elapsed.</i>

274
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,460
- They can't see what the other is doing.
- You're right.

275
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,569
It looks like he's pushing a little.

276
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:11,470
Yeah.

277
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,877
- They're both in a tough spot.
- It's so hard.

278
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,445
The real match starts here.

279
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,161
- It keeps stopping right there.
- Can't get past the slope.

280
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:31,983
<i>Ten minutes have elapsed.</i>

281
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,953
His legs are amazing.

282
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,955
- What is going on?
- It's incredible, really.

283
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:45,490
Yone is getting tired.

284
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,694
He's so exhausted.

285
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:53,265
<i>Fifteen minutes have elapsed.</i>

286
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:30,235
- You got it!
- You can do it. Let's go!

287
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,336
You got this!

288
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:43,815
That's tough.

289
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,818
Whoa, whoa, he's doing it.

290
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,754
- Let's go!
- You got it!

291
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,023
<i>The winner is Takashi Kurihara.</i>

292
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,626
- That looked so hard.
- What a tough challenge.

293
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,028
Nice fight!

294
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,197
- That's tough.
- Fantastic.

295
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:33,265
Wow.

296
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:36,468
- Must be frustrating.
- Nice fight!

297
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,802
That was incredible.

298
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:47,746
- Great fight.
- Thank you.

299
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:48,980
Great fight.

300
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,215
You're strong.

301
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:51,316
Amazing.

302
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,486
- Whatever it takes to win, Kuri.
- That's right.

303
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,487
Kuri.

304
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:58,823
- I did it. I did my best.
- How are you that strong?

305
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:00,759
Damn!

306
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:05,697
My hands are so sweaty.

307
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,266
- Unbelievable.
- So crazy.

308
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,373
Damn.

309
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,962
I think I was able to…

310
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,568
do my absolute best until the end.

311
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,270
And…

312
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,208
I'm glad that I was able to

313
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,044
give him everything I had.

314
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:55,046
I respect him.

315
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,816
I look up to him like an older brother.

316
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:00,852
Now I can go home proud

317
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:02,988
and say to my daughter,

318
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:05,857
"Daddy did his best."

319
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:14,499
Kuri.

320
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,601
You have to win it all now.

321
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,236
- Great game. Great game.
- You can do it.

322
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,638
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

KATSUMA YONEMURA, 28
FORMER JUDO ATHLETE - ELIMINATED

324
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:28,079
- Great fight.
- Great fight. Amazing stuff.

325
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:39,824
<i>The next match is between</i>
<i>Yoshio Itoi and Ryudai Onikura.</i>

326
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,860
Hey.

327
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:43,228
- Have a great match.
- Same to you.

328
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,067
So Itoi is taller than me,
heavier than me,

329
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,869
and has more power than me.

330
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:53,571
If I push head-on, I'll definitely lose.

331
00:27:57,142 --> 00:28:00,145
I wanna earn
that last remaining finals spot somehow.

332
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:03,448
I'll just have to push
with everything I have, yeah.

333
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:07,352
We don't know
how long Onikura will last against him.

334
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:11,322
<i>At the sound of the buzzer,</i>
<i>begin the battle.</i>

335

00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,330
Good luck!

337
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:34,913
So strong!

338
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,715
That's crazy.

339
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:39,784
- <i>The winner is Yoshio Itoi.</i>
- Damn!

340
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,720
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

341
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,391
I knew it. He's so strong.

342
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:47,992
He's a monster.

343
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,696
- Didn't even get tired.
- Probably a bad strategy.

344
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:53,898
Well…

345
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:57,302
I'm frustrated.

346
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,505
I knew my power wasn't enough to win.

347
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:03,575
So I tried to back up a bit,

348
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,878
and then take him by surprise.

349
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:10,648
But in the end,

350
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,885
I was no match for his strength.

351
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:18,790
RYUDAI ONIKURA, 30
FORMER AMATEUR BOXER - ELIMINATED

352
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,025
- Great fight.
- Thank you.

353
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,194
- Do your best.
- I will.

354
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,234
I'm gonna reach the finals.

355
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:35,340
<i>I thought, "I have to give it my all."</i>

356
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:38,143
<i>"I won't be able to win</i>
<i>if I'm not fully committed."</i>

357
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,546
<i>The last round.</i>

358
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:46,084
<i>Takashi Kurihara and Yoshio Itoi.</i>

359
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:52,190
- Bring it on.
- Bring it on. Let's do this.

360
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,491
- Good luck!
- Good luck.

361
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:02,033
<i>Whoever wins this fight</i>

362
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,136
<i>will proceed to the final stage</i>
<i>of the competition.</i>

363
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:07,005
I'm not even in this, and I'm nervous.

364
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,941
If it gets drawn out,
Takashi might have the edge.

365
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:12,243
That's true, but what about his ankle?

366
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:15,580
I mean,
given the state of my ankle injury,

367
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,115
I'm not in the best condition.

368
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:21,085
But, of course, I still have hope.
I'm still gonna do my best to win.

369
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:44,075
- This is crazy.
- Whoa, that's rough.

370
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,984
- Yes!
- Wow!

371
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,486
- Went right through him.
- He pushed through him.

372
00:30:55,987 --> 00:31:00,024
<i>The third athlete</i>
<i>to advance to the final stage</i>

373
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:02,093
<i>is Yoshio Itoi.</i>

374
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:06,431
Amazing.

375
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,603
- Kuri.
- Wow, you were strong.

376
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:12,604
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

377
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,504
Thank you.

378
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,640
You are so strong.

379
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:21,246
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good. Thanks.

380
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:24,782
Nice fight!

381
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,785
- Impressive, seriously.
- Nice job.

382
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:30,989
To be honest…

383
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,631
Kurihara and I had competed before,

384
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:42,600
so I knew that he was a great athlete,

385
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:46,237
that he had incredible physical abilities.

386
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,407
I had to fight with everything,

387
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,878
and it felt like I awakened the spirit
of the true athlete within me.

388
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,582
Seriously, that's how I feel.

389
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:00,485
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

390
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,022
I think that

391
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:08,159
this experience was so valuable for me.

392
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,395
It was unlike any other.

393
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,030
And in the end,

394
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,933
I didn't achieve my dream
of winning it all,

395
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,168
but I'm fulfilled.

396
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:19,837
And it proves that,

397
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:23,241
even if I don't get everything I want,

398
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:24,742
I can still be happy.

399
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:25,810
I can retire

400
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:29,981
as an athlete,
and I won't have any regrets.

401
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,016
I truly have no regrets.

402
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,419
And ultimately, Itoi, I just…

403
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:36,688
I admire you so much.

404
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:37,789
And so

405
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,526
I was honored to compete with you.

406
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:43,795
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

407
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:46,664
Do your best.
Win it all, whatever it takes. Thank you.

408
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:51,269
Thank you.

409
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:54,072
Sorry to let you down. So close.

410
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,741
- Hey, thank you. Seriously.
- You're great. Thank you.

411
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,811

FORMER AMERICAN FOOTBALL

[somber music playing

415
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,179
It's finally the last day.

416
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:37,982
Looking back,

417
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:40,918
it's been truly great.

418
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:42,220
- Yeah.
- So great.

419
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:46,591
Yeah. The first time we sat here
was after the mountain.

420
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:47,959
After the mountain.

421
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,527
That was so tough.

422
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,763
That might have been
the hardest part of the whole thing.

423
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:52,697
Yeah, it was.

424
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,966
You know, in that moment,

425
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:58,269
I could tell that we were about to have
a tough battle ahead of us.

426
00:33:58,336 --> 00:33:59,170
Absolutely.

427
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:04,075
And in the end, I think it was Shozui
who surprised me the most.

428
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:07,178
How many sit-ups was it? Five hundred?

429
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:08,079
I don't know.

430
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,316
- Come on! Let's go.
- Nice.

431
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:16,087
- Here we go.
- Let's go!

432
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,791
Nice job, Yuya!

433
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:22,226
579 REPS

434
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:23,294
Unbelievable.

435
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,229
We both played professional baseball,

436
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,133
and still, I'm just so impressed
with your physical abilities.

437
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,568
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

438
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:33,504
And that was the first time in ages
that I fought for a team like that.

439
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,006
- It was great.
- It was great.

440
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,975
- Yeah, it was amazing.
- Looking out for each other.

441
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,445
- Come on. Let's go.
- Nice work!

442
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:42,580
Let's go, let's go. Next one.

443
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:43,881
Three, two, one…

444
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,287
- We weren't alone.
- That's right.

445
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:52,256
My sport is about the individual,
so I loved winning as a team.

446
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,158
- That's what you were feeling?
- Yeah.

447
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:55,993
There's a greater sense of accomplishment.

448
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,229
- Yeah.
- And you bond with each other.

449
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:04,102
You can truly support each other,
whether you're winning or you're losing.

450
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:06,537
That's right, yeah.
And we lived together as well,

451
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:07,972
so our bonds became even stronger.

452
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,507
They did, for sure.

453
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:14,178
I mean, Yoshio and I
stayed in a small tent together.

454
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,948
- Grown men in their forties.
- Really!

455
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:19,884
Eating miso soup and rice balls,
freezing, like this.

456
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:30,628
<i>The final competition is the Red Stage.</i>

457
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,197
<i>This final stage</i>

458
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:36,534
<i>will test the strength</i>
<i>of your body and spirit.</i>

459
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:37,802
Our spirits?

460
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:41,139
- Our body <i>and </i>spirit.
- Well, I guess it's fitting for the end.

461
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:42,640
- It is.
- Isn't it?

462
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:45,510
<i>Please proceed to the stage.</i>

463
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,044
- Yes!
- The last one.

464
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:49,447
- Here we go! Yeah!
- Bring it on! Bring it on!

465
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:50,748
Good luck!

466
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:06,797
<i>All I'm thinking about is winning.</i>

467
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,535
<i>I'll make sure</i>
<i>my story has a great ending.</i>

468
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:17,275
<i>I'm gonna show everyone</i>
<i>the willpower I still have</i>

469
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,310
<i>as a former boxing world champion.</i>

470
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,549
<i>I think this is gonna be a great match.</i>

471
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:27,351
<i>I just have to give it</i>
<i>everything I've got.</i>

472
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:34,725
Wow.

473
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:39,564
Whoa!

474
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:42,633
Wow, it's huge.

475
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,870
Wow.

476
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:47,438
Wow, look at this.

477
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,174
- It's huge!
- This is huge.

478
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:51,175
So big.

479
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,743
This is gigantic.

480
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,812
What is this all about?

481
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,749
<i>The Red Stage,</i>
<i>the final challenge of the competition,</i>

482
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:01,219
<i>testing your strength and spirit, is</i>

483
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,521
<i>the Final Crawl.</i>

484
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,556
- What is this?
- It's crazy.

485
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:06,924
<i>In this stage,</i>

486
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:11,529
<i>the three finalists will tie</i>
<i>one end of a rope around their waists.</i>

487
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,898
<i>At the sound of the buzzer,</i>

488
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:17,535
<i>you will run toward your goal marker,</i>
<i>ten meters away.</i>

489
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:20,771
<i>You must reach your goal</i>
<i>and be the first to press the button.</i>

490
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:22,807
I see. I understand.

491
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:25,443
We start here, and all run at once.

492
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:26,711
Yeah, that's it.

493
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,480
<i>You may use your hands and feet</i>

494
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:33,517
<i>to grip the climbing holds</i>
<i>that are scattered on the floor.</i>

495
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,888
<i>One point will be awarded</i>
<i>to the competitor</i>

496
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:39,790
<i>who pushes the goal button first.</i>

497
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:44,528
<i>The first competitor to earn two points</i>
<i>will win the competition.</i>

498
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:48,966
<i>However, when one of the competitors</i>
<i>earns a point,</i>

499
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:53,104
<i>his goal button will be placed</i>
<i>one meter further away</i>

500
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,339
<i>for the remainder of the competition.</i>

501
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,908
- They move the goal?
- That's tough!

502
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,979
<i>Each round will last 30 minutes.</i>

503
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,548
<i>If a round ends without a winner,</i>

504
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:07,952
<i>everyone's buttons will be moved</i>
<i>one meter closer to center.</i>

505
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:08,986
I see.

506
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,957
<i>Demonstrate the power</i>
<i>of your body and spirit.</i>

507
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:16,494
<i>Prove once and for all</i>
<i>that you are an elite athlete.</i>

508
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:18,596
This is gonna be tough.

509
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:23,167
There's a good chance that this challenge
will rely on endurance,

510
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:24,902
with lots of gripping and pulling,

511
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,305
so it'll be hard to win this
with strength alone.

512
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:30,941
<i>It's not just about strength.</i>
<i>It's about stamina as well.</i>

513
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:34,945
<i>I think it's a fitting challenge</i>
<i>for the final stage.</i>

514
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,515
Oh, I see.

515
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:40,017
<i>Boxing training is all about stamina.</i>

516
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:42,019
<i>I'm the best when it comes to stamina.</i>

517
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:44,555
<i>Repetitive movements</i>
<i>are part of my training.</i>

518
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:47,892
<i>It'll come down to endurance.</i>
<i>I'll have to draw out the match to win.</i>

519
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,995
<i>Attention.</i>

520
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,863
