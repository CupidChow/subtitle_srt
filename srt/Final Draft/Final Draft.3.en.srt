My tooth! My tooth fell out!

69
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,874
- What?!
- My tooth fell out.

70
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,143
Oh damn. That's gotta hurt.

71
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,146
- Are you all right?
- It's a crown, so it's fine.

72
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,950
<i>I thought I'd been knocked out,</i>

- Kouzi.
- Better give me back my tooth.

91
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,169
His tooth.

92
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,504
Kaji, we're a team.

93

ELIMINATED

95
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,914
You fought well!

96
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,151
I ran out of energy in the end.

97
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,787
My upper arms were so sore,
they eventually just gave up.

98
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,190
But, you know, I gave it everything I had.

99
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,192
So no regrets.

100
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,827
- Thank you.
- Great job!

101
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,195
- Nice!
- You fought well!

Great job!

103
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,232
I was almost there.
That was so frustrating.

104
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,237
I knew that it was going to be
something I'd struggle with.

105
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,206
But it didn't matter. I had to try.

106
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,408
I wanted to get through
this stage somehow.

107
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,878

Hayasaka's a gymnast,
so I think he'll race through it.

114
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,434
It's going to be tough
competing against a gymnast, for sure.

115
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:11,371
Hayasaka,
I'm not paying attention to him at all.

116
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,408
I just have to do my best
and push myself to the limit.

117
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,711
This is what I'm best at,
so it's my time to shine.

118
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,047

- Shoot!
- Jumped like it was nothing!

<i>I didn't wanna be on that</i>
<i>with anyone else.</i>

132
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,630
<i>So I skipped two rungs</i>
<i>at the first set of bars</i>

133
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:13,065
<i>and tried to be the first one</i>
<i>to reach the circle.</i>

134
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,168
By the time I saw him, it was too late.

135
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:16,736
I underestimated him.

136
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,476

Well, now that I know it's over,

158

I feel like I made it so far

159

177
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,773
I think Yone is probably gonna be
the best at this.

178
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:35,808
Yone is a tough opponent,

179
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,877
but I don't wanna
settle for just finishing.

180
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,178
I'll keep up with him, yeah.

181
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,481
I wanna stand out in this stage,
win first place,

182
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:47,420
and aggressively try to put pressure
on the competitors who are on top.

183
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:51,090
When I saw the lodgings
for the high scorers, I was stunned.

184
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,225
It was like a fancy neighborhood.

185
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:56,362
But, for me,
crawling my way from the bottom to the top

186
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,630
is just how I like it.

187
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,966
I can't imagine
a greater feeling than that.

188
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,602
So I'll reach the top,
no matter what it takes.

189
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,837
Making it to the end already seems hard.

190
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,740
I don't know how fast I'll finish.
It's so hard to predict,

191
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,042
given how difficult the course is,
you know?

192
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,444
There's a chance that

193
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:13,512
this could be the end.

194

195
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,694
Yeah, just as I expected.

196
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:30,596
Super fast.

197
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,667

Not too fast!

213
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,784
- Careful.
- Not yet, one more swing.

214
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,285
Yes!

- Aw, man.

217
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,032

222
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,378
I mean,
everyone else was really good at this.

223
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,214
In the end, I didn't make it,

224
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,451
but this was great. Thank you so much.

225
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:03,823
Oh man, I had fun.

226
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:05,791
It was just bad timing.

227
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:08,694
I couldn't get the middle path,
so I chose the one on the left.

228
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,230
I would've made it
if I'd just given it one more swing.

229
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:16,001
But Koji touched the platform,
and I thought, "Oh, he's gonna make it."

230
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,137
So I took a chance and went for it.

231
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:23,275
If I hadn't done all that training,
I would've been eliminated right away.

232
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,611
I was impressed with my growth.

233
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:29,949
Honestly, this was so rewarding.
I'm glad I was able to compete.

234
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,618
I have no regrets.

<i>Ryosuke Miyaguni.</i>

240
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,566
So one of the competitors
that I'm up against

241
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,168
has a big physical frame.

242
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,103
That means my odds are looking good.

243
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,005
People often call me "the lucky girl."

244
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,941
I just need his arms to get tired
and completely give out,

245
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:59,378
and my arms need to be stronger
than they've ever been before.

246
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,313
I just need a miracle and I'll win.

247
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,415
I feel like this is a crucial stage,

248
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:06,051
so I intend to do
whatever it takes to advance.

249
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,821
Antigravity Masato said this was his forte

250
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,690
and expressed
quite a bit of confidence in himself.

251
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,025
So I just want second.

252
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:16,095
At this point, I'm painfully aware
of how capable everyone is.

253
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,897
This stage is do or die for me.

254
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,331
I wanna end up on top.

00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:04,576
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

350
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,677
Thank you.

351
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,313
<i>I feel the rush of blood</i>
<i>Going over my head</i>

352
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,849
I mean, I kinda knew I wouldn't advance.

353
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,651
I went for broke and ended up broke.

354
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,853
I felt honored to join such a great team,

355
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,157
and while I was afraid of being a burden
to them, a part of me felt like,

356
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:19,658
"Wow, lucky me!" You know?

357
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,428
But I guess trying to win
by relying on others was pretty naive.

358
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:27,432
That being said, they encouraged me
to keep going until the end,

359
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,936
and ultimately
I was able to finish the challenge.

360
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,639
So I feel thankful for their support.

361
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:38,377
<i>Five competitors have been eliminated.</i>

362
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,078
<i>In last place,</i>

363
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,914
<i>with the slowest overall time,</i>

364
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,116
<i>and therefore being eliminated…</i>

365
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,386
<i>is Kouzi.</i>

366
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:48,820
KOUZI, 35
ELIMINATED

367
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,561
<i>Those who have been eliminated,</i>

368
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,829
<i>please say your goodbyes.</i>

369
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,165
Don't laugh, Little Rhino.

370
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:01,767
Okay.

371
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:06,638
Seriously, when this game started,
they made us do some insane stuff,

372
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:10,209
and I didn't know how to work on a team
since I play an individual sport.

373
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:13,512
So I was thinking, "What?
Seriously? I'm not gonna like this."

374
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,081
But it was fun to be able to fight
alongside my teammates

375
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,082
for the first time.

376
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:20,352
I was a bit of a delinquent,
so I didn't even go on school field trips.

377
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,654
I just thought I was way too cool to go.

378
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,024
So this turned out to be
such a great experience for me.

379
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:29,795
I didn't leave my mark as an athlete,
but my tooth left a mark for sure.

380
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,764
So take this front tooth, Little Rhino,
and good luck.

381
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:34,733
Thank you.

382
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,767
Thank you.

383
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,475
Well, I'm definitely gonna carry this
until the end,

384
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,744
win the 30 million,
and buy you a new tooth.

385
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,213
You'll win it all for me?

386
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,849
Yes. If I don't win,
then you'll have to leave that gap.

387
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,352
You're the best. Thank you.

388
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:22,881
<i>Attention. Great work today.</i>

389
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,818
<i>Now you will earn points</i>
<i>based on your times,</i>

390
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:30,455
<i>resulting in new high-</i>
<i>and low-scoring groups.</i>

391
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:36,695
<i>The competitors in first through seventh</i>
<i>will be the high scorers group.</i>

392
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,337
<i>In first, Yuya Shozui.</i>

393
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,973
- Wow, he stayed where he was.
- He's so strong.

394
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,708
- Nice!
- Performing well.

395
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:50,709
Thanks.

396
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:53,779
<i>In second, Katsuma Yonemura.</i>

397
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,047
Yes! I moved up.

398
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:58,083
- You jumped up.
- He jumped a few spots.

399
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,052
- Well, he finished first.
- He was so fast.

400
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:02,821
<i>In third, Atsushi Arai.</i>

401
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,992
I'm stuck here, you know.

402
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,694
- Dang.
- Oh man.

403
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,396
<i>In fourth, Kazuhiro Goya.</i>

404
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:12,431
Yes!

405
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,434
Three more to go.

406
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:18,437
<i>In fifth, Takashi Kurihara.</i>

407
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,772
- Thank you.
- I knew you'd be in that group.

408
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:24,309
<i>In sixth, Ryudai Onikura.</i>

409
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,311
- So just one more left.
- That's great.

410
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:27,579
<i>In seventh,</i>

411
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,848
<i>Masato.</i>

412
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,683
Oh!

413
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,985
- Barely. I'm in.
- The groups are totally different.

414
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:34,886
Finally.

415
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,996
<i>Please, proceed to your tent sites.</i>

416
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:48,700
- Big change.
- Look at how it looks at night.

417
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:50,702
This is pretty crazy.

418
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,205
- Perfect for Insta.
- So glad we could come back.

419
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,308
- We have a newcomer to the group, right?
- Yep.

420
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,410
- Just Masato, I think.
- I'm the only one?

421
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:01,413
- What do you think?
- This is like heaven. Really.

422
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,981
- The room is domed,
- Yeah.

423
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,150
- With a heater.
- The bedding is super soft.

424
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,451
I mean, it's the best.

425
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:09,354
Wow, for real? This is way better.

426
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,189
Damn, this is awesome.

427
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:13,825
I'm just happy to have a real bed.

428
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,728
That sleeping bag,
I couldn't sleep at all.

429
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,397
- We did great today.
- Sure did!

430
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:19,931
We did it. I'm so happy.

431
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:22,534
- We're feeling pretty relieved, right?
- For sure. I'm relieved.

432
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,070
I moved up from, like, seventh to sixth.

433
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,772
- Ah.
- Mm.

434
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,540
- And you moved up.
- Seventeenth.

435
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,976
- From seventeenth to… Seventh.
- To seventh, yeah.

436
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:33,078
- Wait, you moved up ten spots?
- Yeah.

437
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,180
I barely made the higher group.
I'm so lucky.

438
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,316
- I feel that.
- We have to maintain this quality of life.

439
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,385
- It's different.
- It affects us physically.

440
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,320
If you lose this, it'll feel horrible.

441
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,623
- Here we are.
- I'm so bummed.

442
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,391
The tents for the low scorers.

443
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,393
- No way.
- So tiny!

444
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,629
Man, you gotta be kidding me.

445
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:51,596
It's cold!

446
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,568
The bedding is tiny.

447
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,137
How does this work?

448
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:02,474
These conditions are rough.

449
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:08,713
So narrow!

450
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,582
So cold!

451
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:13,318
I can't wait to join
the high-scoring group.

452
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,254
Oh, I see!

453
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:20,492
- Ah! This is so small.
- This is so small.

454
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,160
It's cold.

455
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:26,665
The others lived like this?
And still competed?

456
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,067
This isn't a single. It's a half.

457
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:32,204
This is harsh living for sure.

458
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,007
Here we are again.

459
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,345
But at least we're still in it.

460
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,583
- Right?
- But now we're in 13th and 14th place.

461
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:45,550
True.

462
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,119
Do you think you can move up?

463
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:54,426
I mean, we might just have to
desperately keep up with them.

464
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,862
And then we'll be the guys
that always end up back here.

465
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,498
- Everyone ignores us, but we hang around.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

466
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:03,201
Kinda sad, right?

467
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,606
So sad.

468
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:15,747
<i>Attention. Dinner is ready.</i>
<i>Please meet at the pool.</i>

469
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,483
Compared to what you had yesterday,
this will be a treat.

470
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,852
I can't wait to see what it is.
I'm looking forward to it.

471
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,321
- Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!
- What is it?

472
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:25,423
- Whoa.
- What is it?

473
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,492
- Wow! Sukiyaki?
- It's sukiyaki!

474
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,994
- Seriously?
- Yes!

475
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,896
Sukiyaki! Oh my God!

476
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,798
- This is a big deal!
- I'm so excited.

477
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,734
Hold on a second. This is insane.

478
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,369
- What do you think?
- Hold on.

479
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:39,504
- Looks good?
- It's beef, man. It's beef!

480
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,608
Whoa, this one is huge!

481
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,011
Don't wanna take too much.

482
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,114
- Today, we have Masato.
- Yes.

483
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,016
Joining us in our group.

484
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:53,985
- Yeah.
- Let's keep the same group.

485
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,453
If we're able to.

486
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,155
- Right.
- We'll keep fighting till the end.

487
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,790
- Yes!
- Yes! Let's eat!

488
00:25:58,857 --> 00:25:59,925
Let's eat!

489
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,527
- Dig in.
- Looks good, right?

490
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:04,429
This is the best.

491
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:05,764
I'm digging in.

492
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:11,036
Let's try it without the sauce first.

493
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,243
Delicious.

494
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:23,481
Mmm, so good!

495
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,151
- This tastes way too good.
- Mmm!

496
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,653
I wanted to feast at least once.

497
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,721
It must be devastating

498
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,724
for those who dropped from the higher
to the lower group.

499
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:33,992
It's gotta be tough.

500
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,760
I wonder if Itoi's doing okay.

501
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,662
He's like, "You gotta be kidding me!"

502
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,399
So what do we get to eat?

503
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,501
- Well…
- What do we got?

504
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:46,137
- It looks good.
- A better spread.

505
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:48,206
- I see a bunch of pots.
- What is it?

506
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,875
- Oh, it's curry!
- What? Curry? That sounds great!

507
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,678
- We hit the jackpot!
- "Chicken breast keema curry."

508
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,314
- Itoi, this is great.
- Looks good to me!

509
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,783
- Looks great!
- I'm happy. I like this.

510
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,518
- It's our lucky day.
- We're lucky?

511
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,654
- You're very lucky.
- I'm lucky?

512
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:05,156
- It's my birthday too.
- Oh, right, his birthday.

513
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:06,625
Something to celebrate.

514
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:08,093
It's a birthday curry.

515
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,661
A birthday curry?

516
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:12,464
Never heard of that.
A birthday curry is new to me.

517
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,767
Okay, then. I'll start dishing it up.

518
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:18,036
- We're all experienced at doing this now.
- Yeah!

519
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,039
- Experienced for sure.
- So experienced.

520
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,875
Wait, are you working
as the school lunch server now?

521
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:25,276
Are you the lunch lady?

522
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,212
So good at it, and they volunteered.

523
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:28,546
Hello and welcome.

524
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:29,981
Welcome.

525
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,083
- No, it's fine. I can do it.
- Here you are.

526
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,218
- Okay, here.
- Oh, I see.

527
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:35,754
- I'll be in charge of serving tea.
- We should take turns.

528
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,956
- I'm in charge of plates.
- How many do we have?

529
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:39,691
I can help with plates.
There's seven of us.

530
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,694
- I was in the mood for curry.
- Yeah.

531
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,963
- Okay, everyone, let's say grace.
- Okay.

532
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,065
Let's all move up
to the high scorers group tomorrow.

533
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,134
- Let's eat!
- Let's eat!

534
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:50,468
Let's eat.

535
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,571
Having curry in the cold is the best.

536
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,473
- Wow, it's good!
- This is good!

537
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,242
- What the…
- This is really good.

538
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,878
- Jackpot!
- Wow, this is so good.

539
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:01,279
Mmm!

540
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:04,482
So good, yeah.

541
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,218
But the one who gets eliminated
is the lowest scorer.

542
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:09,120
- The lowest from the low group.
- Yeah.

543
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:12,257
So that means it'll be one of us.
Most likely from our group.

544
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:13,458
Hmm.

545
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,794
Someone from the other group
should be eliminated next.

546
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,962
- Yeah, you're right.
- Kick 'em out.

547
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,065
Hayasaka, what's your birthday resolution?

548
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:22,400
- Birthday resolution?
- As a 29-year-old.

549
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:26,571
- A 29-year-old's resolution?
- My resolution as a 29-year-old…

550
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,074
It's the last year in my twenties, so…

551
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,343
Yeah. I intend to enrich my life,

552
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,479
both work and personal. Seriously.

553
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:37,148
- Nice.
- I've been letting life slip away.

554
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,884
So I wanna be more intentional at 29.
That's it.

555
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:41,953
- You got this!
- A girlfriend!

556
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,622
- You'll find a girlfriend for sure.
- I'll definitely find one.

557
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,325
You've put it out there.

558
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:51,563
You're right.

559
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:57,068
<i>The next stage will be a team competition.</i>

560
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,036
- What?
- What?

561
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,437
Here comes the next challenge.

562
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,039
- Here it comes!
- Seriously?

563
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:02,474
It's finally time.

564
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,543
<i>The current first place contestant,</i>

565
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,712
<i>Yuya Shozui,</i>

566
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:08,980
<i>and second,</i>

567
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:10,715
<i>Katsuma Yonemura,</i>

568
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,684
<i>will become team captains.</i>

569
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:16,020
<i>They will be in charge</i>
<i>of choosing competitors</i>

570
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,522
<i>to join their teams.</i>

571
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:21,359
<i>Select the best athletes</i>
<i>to compete against the other team.</i>

572
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:24,395
First and second place
have different strengths.

573
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:25,730
Seriously?

574
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:28,066
- Depends on what we're competing in.
- True.

575
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,568
- Oh! A chicken fight!
- What?

576
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:33,171
- No way that's happening.
- How would that even work?

577
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,473
Hard to imagine
a seven-man chicken fight team.

578
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:39,144
<i>The number of teams</i>
<i>that can participate is two,</i>

579
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:42,213
<i>with a total of 12 participants.</i>

580
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,414
- What?
- What?!

581
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:47,719
<i>The two contestants</i>
<i>who are not selected will be eliminated.</i>

582
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,720
- What?!
- What?!

583
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,522
I can't make that kind of decision!

584
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,891
- Please don't do this, please.
- That's so cruel.

585
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,726
- What?!
- You can't be serious!

586
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,761
Wait a second. They can't be serious.

587
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,530
Ah, give me a break.

588
00:29:58,596 --> 00:29:59,798
We're the bad guys.

589
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:00,832
What?!

590
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:03,434
- Eliminated for no reason?
- This is outrageous.

591
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,236
That is insane.

592
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,939
Isn't this the most brutal way
to be eliminated?

593
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,107
Is this for real?

594
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:10,842
This is crazy, right?

595
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,311
<i>Tomorrow, at the sound of the bell,</i>

596
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:15,180
<i>we will begin the draft process.</i>

597
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,850
All you have to go on
are the previous competitions, you know?

598
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:21,152
- Base it on past results?
- Yeah.

599
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:25,356
Our personalities and times,
that's all you have to help you decide.

600
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,259
This blows my mind. It's insane.

601
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,396
It's crazy, all the things
they've been putting us through

602
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:32,664
since yesterday.

603
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:35,066
The captains have to pick their teammates

604
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,868
without knowing what we're doing, right?

605
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:40,071
You're right. But odds are
the challenge will be about power.

606
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:41,840
I think so too.

607
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:45,143
Since it's teams, it might be about
how quickly we can move big objects.

608
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,812
Or, like, it could be pushing things.

609
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,982
<i>In an instant, I was filled with anxiety.</i>

610
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:54,018
Kabaddi is an unfamiliar sport,
so that's a disadvantage for me.

611
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:56,888
I imagine it'll be difficult
to choose an athlete for your team

612
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,790
if you're not familiar with their skills.

613
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,792
I'm feeling incredibly nervous.

614
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:06,531
- I don't know what to do.
- This is too ruthless.

615
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:09,601
I mean,
two people are gonna be gone, right?

616
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:11,970
- Yeah. Isn't that so cruel?
- It really is.

617
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,371
They don't compete for it.

618
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:16,107
They just get picked,
and that's it for them.

619
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:17,575
It hurts.

620
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:19,410
Man, this is so hard.

621
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:23,581
Yeah…

622
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,825
I think I tend to put my trust
in people too quickly.

623
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,427
So, when I think about who to pick,

624
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:39,163
all I remember are moments
when they were nice to me.

625
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:43,001
Perhaps I should disregard personality

626
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:46,204
and look strictly at their scores,
you know?

627
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,806
I'm just not so sure
if I can do that though.

628
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,810
I was enjoying a delicious dinner,
but then,

629
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:55,847
all of a sudden, my heart sank.

630
00:31:56,981 --> 00:32:01,085
Everyone has given their all
and fought to stay in this competition.

631
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:04,155
But two will be gone
without even competing.

632
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,658
I can't believe it's really happening.

633
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:23,341
Two of them
will be eliminated based on our decisions.

634
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:24,742
- It hurts. It hurts.
- <i>That's tough</i>.

635
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:25,643
WIFE: HONAMI

636
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,911
Please save me.

637
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,446
<i>Save you?</i>

638
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,648
- <i>That's hard.</i>
- Make me feel better.

639
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:32,150
<i>That'll be hard to do,</i>

640
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:33,851
<i>but I believe that</i>

641
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:37,522
<i>the people you choose</i>
<i>will also know that it's hard.</i>

642
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:41,559
<i>It'll definitely take a toll</i>
<i>on the ones who have to pick,</i>

643
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,827
<i>and they'll know that.</i>

644
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:45,964
<i>So do your best. </i>

645
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:47,899
I appreciate it.

646
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,035
<i>She reminded me</i>
<i>that I wasn't alone in this.</i>

647
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:52,437
<i>I can't afford to lose,</i>

648
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:56,040
<i>so I intend to stay strong</i>
<i>and make a firm choice</i>

649
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:57,308
<i>without compromising.</i>

650
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,479
<i>I can't fall asleep.</i>

651
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,414
<i>I can't stop thinking about it.</i>

652
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,651
<i>Thinking doesn't do any good,</i>
<i>but I can't turn my brain off.</i>

653
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,820
<i>Hi. Can you see me?</i>

654
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:11,456
- <i>We can see you.</i>
- Hey.

655
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:12,690
ELDEST DAUGHTER
SECOND DAUGHTER

656
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:14,158
- How are you?
- <i>Who's that?</i>

657
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:16,160
<i>- Papa.</i>
<i>- Yep, that's Daddy.</i>

658
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,029
I managed to survive.

659
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:21,899
<i>That's amazing. You could be home with us.</i>

660
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:23,868
<i>That's what I was thinking.</i>
<i>But you survived.</i>

661
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,903
<i>Get closer. Get closer to see your daddy.</i>

662
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,140
- Mi.
- <i>Mi!</i>

663
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,009
Is she crying? When I come home,

664
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,544
let's have some play time
and eat delicious food.

665
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:36,280
<i>- Ruka, can you say, "Daddy, do your best"?</i>
- Oh.

666
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:38,049
<i>Ready? Go.</i>

667
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:39,751
- <i>Papa.</i>
- Ah!

668
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:46,858
That's good enough. She tried. I felt it.

669
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:49,460
I felt your energy. Thank you.

670
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,362
Okay, give me some, Mi.

671
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:53,031
<i>Daddy.</i>

672
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:53,931
Yeah?

673
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,768
- <i>Just Daddy.</i>
- Hmm?

674
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:58,336
<i>Just Daddy.</i>

675
00:33:58,403 --> 00:33:59,504
Just me?

676
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,839
What is?

677
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:06,144
- <i>That I love.</i>
- Really?

678
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,782
I love you, too, so much.

679
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,121
<i>While you've been away, Dad,</i>

680
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,924
<i>you've been number one</i>
<i>on her favorite people list.</i>

681
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,859
Are you serious?!

682
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:23,995
I'll do my best.

683
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:27,865
<i>He'll do his best,</i>
<i>because he knows that you love him.</i>

684
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:30,535
- <i>We're rooting for you.</i>
- Thank you.

685
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:35,273
Okay, bye now, Mi, Ruka, Emi. Bye-bye.

686
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,279
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

687
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:43,181
- Great job today.
- You too.

688
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,882
- Okay if I join you?
- Oh, sure. Please.

689
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,884
- Ah, thank you so much.
- Sure.

690
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:49,921
- Great job today.
- You too.

691
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:51,022
It's cold, isn't it?

692
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,991
So do you have, like a vision
or some sort of idea

693
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:56,027
about what your team
is going to look like?

694
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,964
Not really an idea of a team,
more like grouping people by categories.

695
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,632
- Oh, I see.
- Power, speed, or balance.

696
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:02,900
Right, right, right, right.

697
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:06,204
So could you perhaps tell me
where do I excel?

698
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,806
- You're speed, right?
- Do you know about kabaddi?

699
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:10,675
I've only seen it a couple times,
to be honest.

700
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:12,110
Ah, gotcha. I see.

701
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:14,779
It's pretty much team-based martial arts.

702
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,747
- And it's very similar to rugby.
- Right, right.

703
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:18,282
It's a contact sport.

704
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,918
And on top of that,
you have to be quick as hell.

705
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,820
If you're not,
you'll get caught immediately.

706
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:25,857
Yeah.

707
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:27,492
I get that, yeah.

708
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,761
So if I get the opportunity,

709
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:33,097
I'll fight with everything I've got.

710
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:35,133
- Thank you for taking the time.
- Yeah, likewise.

711
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,434
- Let's keep doing our best.
- Yes.

712
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:39,570
<i>I have to think this through</i>
<i>before making up my mind.</i>

713
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,106
<i>I know everyone's here</i>
<i>in search of a life change.</i>

714
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:46,511
<i>The fact is, Shozui and I are</i>
<i>responsible for a very important decision.</i>

715
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:49,413
This is too hard.

716
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:02,293
<i>Good morning. The draft will begin at noon</i>

717
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,195
<i>at the sound of the bell.</i>

718
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:08,566
<i>Until then, low scorers, high scorers,</i>

719
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:10,568
<i>spend your time as you wish.</i>

720
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:15,673
<i>Hmm.</i>
<i>I definitely did not get enough sleep.</i>

721
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,776
<i>I kept waking up, my mind racing</i>
<i>about who we were going to choose.</i>

722
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,679
<i>And then I was like,</i>
<i>"Oh no, go back to sleep."</i>

723
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:31,923
Hey.

724
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,759
What's up? Hey.

725
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:36,761
KAZUHIRO GOYA, 31

726
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:38,396
It's so hot.

727
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:41,799
To be honest, between Yone and you,

728
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,168
and I'm just trusting my gut,

729
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:45,203
if I were picked,

730
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,973
I'd wanna be on your team.
'Cause if we're together,

731
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,775
we can win.

732
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,910
That's how I feel.

733
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,880
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

734
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:57,448
- All right, then.
- Thank you.

735
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:03,821
- Hi there. Hi.
- Oh, hi.

736
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,524
You know, you and I haven't talked much.

737
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:10,761
But I feel like, for the next competition,
team solidarity will be important.

738
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,463
Yeah, I think it's definitely the case.

739
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,498
I totally agree
that's going to be necessary to win.

740
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,467
Right? I know I'm not an obvious choice,

741
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,736
but I've done stuff
like obstacle course racing.

742
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:22,607
- I have skills that others might not have.
- Right.

743
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:25,776
So, if I'm that missing puzzle piece,
I think I can be vital

744
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:26,877
to the team's success.

745
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:29,046
- Mm-hmm.
- Shozui…

746
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:31,182
- Oh, hey.
- Hey there. Don't mind me. I'm just--

747
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,050
- Yes?
- You know I'm about making this fun.

748
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:34,652
- Okay.
- That's all I'm after, really.

749
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,288
- Thank you. Yeah. Thank you.
- Let's do this. Good!

750
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:40,191
- I also came to show you my backflip.
- Okay, yeah, let's see it.

751
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:42,593
That's crazy.

752
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:44,595
- I'm that good.
- Truly a gymnast.

753
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:46,163
- Let's do our best.
- Let's do our best.

754
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,798
- Do your best.
- Do your best.

755
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:50,268
I guess it's my turn
to defy gravity, yeah?

756
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:51,936
Oh, come on. You're all showing off.

757
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:54,138
Okay. Here we go. Yay. Thank you so much.

758
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:55,940
- Wow, amazing!
- Yes.

759
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:56,941
As always.

760
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:58,843
- That's all I got.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

761
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:02,146
- Kabaddi, let's see it.
- Kabbadi, kabbadi, kabbadi, kabbadi.

762
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:04,282
That's what it's like.

763
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,685
I'm ready to give it my all.
My kabaddi spirit will fight till the end.

764
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,720
- Okay.
- Good luck with your kabaddi-cision.

765
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:10,721
Kabaddi-cision!

766
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:17,595
Kabaddi-cision, huh?

767
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:23,167
Our leader!

768
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:26,404
YOSHIO ITOI, 43

769
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,638
Shozui!

770
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,574
Been a while!

771
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:31,842
It's been a while.

772
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:35,279
- It's been so long.
- What the heck did you bring with you?

773
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,816
- These are bats, of course!
- No way. Those things?

774
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:42,753
They're handmade bats!
Can't you tell I've made them myself?

775
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,122
- That's so you.
- Let's practice our swing.

776
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,627
- It feels great, yeah?
- It's the best.

777
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:51,495
- It's the best, right?
- It's the best.

778
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,132
I mean, Hozumi, he was
shadowboxing in the morning.

779
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:57,435
- Okay.
- I was like, "Damn, he's cool!"

780
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:00,004
I felt like doing something, too,
saw some branches,

781
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,872
and thought, "I'll practice my swing."

782
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,343
And then I thought,
"Who should join me? Oh, I know!"

783
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,878
- Since I'm a fielder.
- 'Cause you're a fielder.

784
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:10,414
You swing it beautifully though.

785
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:11,882
Nah, I couldn't hit well.

786
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,619
- Maybe you hit better now.
- Do you think I'd hit better now?

787
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,688
They call it the draft.

788
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:19,623
It's just like baseball.

789
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,624
At this stage,

790
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,893
I didn't expect us to be drafted.

791
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,161
That's for damn sure.

792
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,864
- But choosing sucks too.
- It does.

793
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:29,667
I feel like I'm on the recruiting squad.

794
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:32,570
Right. So I'm gonna practice swings
and leave the rest to heaven.

795
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:35,339
Like this.

796
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:39,343
Man…

797
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:44,682
<i>If it's between us two,</i>
<i>I'm guessing Shozui is more popular.</i>

798
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:48,552
<i>He's bigger than me.</i>

799
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:56,927
Yes?

800
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,631
Pardon me.

801
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,600
- Yeah?
- Hey.

802
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:03,601
Been a minute.

803
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,703
Look how fancy this room is.

804
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,906
- Is this your first time inside?
- Yeah, I've never been in one of these.

805
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,308
- So, speaking for myself…
- Yeah.

806
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,111
The biggest asset I have to offer you
is my brute strength.

807
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:15,913
- Your power, right? Mm-hmm.
- Yes.

808
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,683
The mountain,
the sit-ups, the monkey bars…

809
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,286
- Yeah.
- My strength helped for sure.

810
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:24,355
Hello?

811
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,123
<i>- I can hear you.</i>
- Oh!

812
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,191
FATHER: TAKAFUMI-SAN

813
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,059
What do you think
the next challenge'll be?

814
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:31,328
<i>Let's see. Maybe lifting a giant barrel?</i>

815
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:33,464
I knew it! You think so too, right?!

816
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:34,665
<i>Something like that, I think.</i>

817
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:37,067
You know what?
That's exactly what I was thinking.

818
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:40,371
Man! I knew it.
It's our shared Tsukamoto blood.

819
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,572
I knew you'd get it.

820
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,641
- It'll be the barrel.
- <i>Yeah, the barrel.</i>

821
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:44,975
- <i>It'll definitely be that.</i>
- Yeah.

822
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:48,546
Trust me, I know it's coming.

823
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,414
It'll definitely be
a strength-based challenge.

824
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:53,584
Yeah. Seriously,
I just feel so confused about it.

825
00:40:55,419 --> 00:41:00,524
This isn't about who to choose
and who to eliminate at this point.

826
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:02,793
It's about maximizing strength.

827
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:15,973
Good morning.

828
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,509
- Hey there. What's up?
- Hey there.

829
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:22,146
- Just so you know, I'm a gymnast.
- That's right.

830
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,381
In terms of ability,

831
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:26,116
I feel like I have a lot to offer a team.

832
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:27,017
I'd think so.

833
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:30,321
What kind of stuff did you do throughout
your career? Like, how did you train?

834
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:31,622
You know the rings?

835
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:33,524
- When we hold ourselves up?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

836
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,226
That's the most
physically demanding event.

837
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:38,362
- That looks intense for sure.
- It takes leg strength, arm strength.

838
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,264
The whole body, especially this part…

839
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,799
Feels like you're getting torn apart.

840
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:44,435
When I watch,
I'm worried their arm will get ripped off.

841
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,338
- You're nervous, yeah?
- I'm getting very nervous.

842
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,073
I'm the least likely pick, to be honest.

843
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:50,574
No, no, no, I don't think so.

844
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,845
- <i>How are you doing?</i>
- Yeah, I'm good.

845
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,714
<i>Are you working hard?</i>

846
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,317
Tomorrow's event,
well, it hasn't been announced yet,

847
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:03,754
but the top two contestants
are now captains, and they choose teams.

848
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:04,655
<i>I see.</i>

849
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:07,958
And two people who don't get picked
will be eliminated.

850
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,394
- <i>What?!</i>
- Without even competing, you know?

851
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,329
So I'm nervous.

852
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:14,365
- I might not get picked.
- <i>I'm not surprised.</i>

853
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:16,734
But there's something about you
that's invaluable.

854
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,503
- What's that?
- <i>Your unconditional confidence.</i>

855
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,105
- <i>That's your strength.</i>
- You're right.

856
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:23,340
<i>So just do your best.</i>
<i>There's nothing to lose.</i>

857
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:25,042
<i>Unless it kills you.</i>

858
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,043
<i>Let's go!</i>

859
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,345
- <i>Don't chicken out.</i>
- Gotcha.

860
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,047
- I'll do my best.
- <i>Do your best.</i>

861
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:32,650
- I won't chicken out. I'll give it my all.
- <i>That's good.</i>

862
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:36,086
- Let's win this. Let's win this.
- Yes, let's definitely win this.

863
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:37,688
We have to be fully committed.

864
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:43,093
In the end, we want
all the martial artists to survive, right?

865
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,729
The best way to do that is to win.
That's all we can do.

866
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:48,933
It's possible
that the choices you two make

867
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:52,202
will completely alter
the course of <i>Final Draft</i>.

868
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,738
So you can't just pick randomly, right?

869
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,915
- <i>The time has come.</i>
- It's time.

870
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:07,918
<i>Everyone, the draft will begin shortly.</i>

871
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:10,621
<i>- Please gather in the main area.</i>
- It's time.

872
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:14,124
<i>It'll be</i>
<i>a very difficult decision to make.</i>

873
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:16,393
<i>But I have to be aggressive to win.</i>

874
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:22,232
<i>When I committed to this,</i>
<i>I staked my entire life on winning.</i>

875
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,302
<i>I felt like</i>
<i>I didn't have much of a choice.</i>

876
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:38,082
<i>The draft… will now begin.</i>

877
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:44,555
<i>Team captains will announce</i>
<i>their selections,</i>

878
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,824
<i>starting with their first picks.</i>

879
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:03,741
<i>The two competitors</i>
<i>not chosen will be eliminated.</i>

880
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,685
<i>Round 1.</i>

881
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:17,254
<i>Yuya Shozui has chosen…</i>

882
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,795
<i>…Takashi Kurihara.</i>

883
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:30,601
<i>Katsuma Yonemura has chosen…</i>

884
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,638
<i>Takashi Kurihara.</i>

885
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,074
No way.
