1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,640
What?

2
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:09,776
What's this?

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,111
I'm a little scared.

4
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,179
Wait.

5
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:16,049
KENTA TSUKAMOTO, 29
FORMER BODYBUILDER

6
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:18,218
"You may withdraw from <i>Final Draft</i>

7
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:21,588
and drop out of the game
with a portion of the 30 million yen."

8
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:23,690
"You will leave with three million yen."

9
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:28,495
"However, you may only drop out
if you're the first one in line."

10
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,033
Three million yen.

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,315
"If you quit now,
you'll get three million yen."

12
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,618
"You have until the morning to decide."

13
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:53,453
YOSHIO ITOI, 43

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,322
Seriously?! It's such a tough decision.

15
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:58,391
It's not for me though.

16
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,994
The days have been tough.

17
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:03,363
The battles have been grueling.

18
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,564
I've come this far.

19
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,733
I've survived every challenge.

20
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:11,271
I can't quit at this point,
after coming all this way. I can't.

21
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,142
Mm, I imagine
some people are considering this though.

22
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:18,144
TAKASHI KURIHARA, 37

23
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:20,046
This is so mean.

24
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:23,083
Someone will definitely take this offer.

25
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,617
Someone will leave.

26
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,352
It's three million yen.

27
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,555
Seriously?

28
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,393
Oh man.

29
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:36,896
Well…

30
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:38,731
To be honest, my feeling is,

31
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,234
I'm kind of torn.

32
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:44,971
Of course I want the three million yen.

33
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:46,239
On the other hand,

34
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,273
I've learned…

35
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,508
Cheers!

36
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:51,277
…so much hanging out
with the other athletes.

37
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:52,712
It means a lot to me.

38
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:57,650
If I choose to give up
this learning opportunity for myself,

39
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:01,421
is that really a good decision?

40
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:02,655
That's the question.

41
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:07,293
Everyone here was a professional athlete
at some point.

42
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,428
FATHER: TAKAFUMI-SAN

43
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,164
It's so exciting to live
and connect with them.

44
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:16,102
It reminds me of when I played rugby.
It reminds me of a great time in my life.

45
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:20,206
Honestly, it reminded me
how nice team sports can be.

46
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:25,245
I started playing rugby when I was three,
all the way through college.

47
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,413
I'm very thankful for that experience.

48
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,715
Without that experience,

49
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:33,953
I don't think I would have enjoyed
living together with the other athletes.

50
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:38,158
<i>I feel like you played rugby</i>
<i>because I wanted you to.</i>

51
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,460
<i>I've been wondering</i>
<i>if it was a good thing.</i>

52
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:41,961
<i>I still think about it.</i>

53
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:46,399
<i>So hearing you say all of this right now</i>
<i>makes me happy. I'm very grateful.</i>

54
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,102
I wanna show you what I'm capable of

55
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,605
and express my gratitude
for what you've done for me.

56
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,875
- I'll get 30 million if I win.
- <i>Mm.</i>

57
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:59,712
If I win, I'd like to take you all
on vacation to Hawaii.

58
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,781
<i>That sounds great. That's great, yeah.</i>

59
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,449
You've never been to Hawaii, right?

60
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,751
<i>No. You gotta win.</i>

61
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:09,255
<i>I told him I'd take my family</i>
<i>on vacation to Hawaii.</i>

62
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:13,026
Frankly,
three million yen is enough to do that.

63
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,297
Oh man, seriously?
Are we doing this again?

64
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,198
KATSUMA YONEMURA, 28

65
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:21,301
Three million yen is a lot of money.

66
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,002
It's complicated because

67
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:27,407
I'm working as a barber, cutting hair.

68
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,776
I changed my career.

69
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,245
And so, of course,
money can be a little tight.

70
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:35,348
But if you look at the other athletes,

71
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:38,017
I'm not sure I have what it takes
to beat all of them.

72
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,155
So it's tempting.
I can't deny that I'm thinking about it.

73
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,558
Yeah. I have a beautiful family.

74
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,727
I can't just pretend I don't
and keep going.

75
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:48,895
ELDEST DAUGHTER
WIFE

76
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,797
How are you doing there?

77
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,832
We're doing great, aren't we, honey?

78
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,336
Do you remember when I told you
I'd become a barber?

79
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,205
- Remember when I said that?
- <i>Mm.</i>

80
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,107
How did that make you feel?

81
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:04,310
<i>Honestly, I was like,</i>
<i>"What is he talking about?!"</i>

82
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,280
<i>Where would we live? Where would you work?</i>

83
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:10,149
<i>There were so many things to consider,</i>
<i>things that might change.</i>

84
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:13,119
<i>But now you've become successful at it,</i>

85
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:16,756
<i>and… you seem happy doing it.</i>

86
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,958
<i>So I'm happy that you made that choice.</i>

87
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:22,028
Hmm. But even then, you know,

88
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,498
I need to start earning more
for our family.

89
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:28,234
- We're going to have another child.
- <i>That's right.</i>

90
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,303
I hope you're both doing okay.

91
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,237
<i>Yes.</i>

92
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,273
<i>It'd be truly amazing if you won.</i>

93
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,207
Yeah.

94
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,943
- <i>You could win it all.</i>
- Let's see.

95
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,279
<i>- Daddy, I think--</i>
<i>- I want you to do your best.</i>

96
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,180
<i>- Mommy, I can buy him…</i>
<i>- Yeah?</i>

97
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,283
<i>- A cake to eat.</i>
<i>- You wanna buy a cake?</i>

98
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,951
<i>- Yeah, a cake.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

99
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,820
<i>Say, "Papa, you got this!"</i>

100
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,555
<i>Papa, you got this!</i>

101
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:56,195
Oh man, this is so hard.

102
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,307
You don't use a mat?

103
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,475
Let's go!

104
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,616
RYUDAI ONIKURA, 30
FORMER AMATEUR BOXER

105
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,051
It's so hot.

106
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,154
- You do this much?
- No, not really.

107
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,028
- You see the letter they left?
- I did.

108
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,497
Three million yen is

109
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,366
not easy to get, you know?

110
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,701
- Mm, I get it.
- I feel like,

111
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,670
for guys in your position,
guys like you and Itoi…

112
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:38,738
HOZUMI HASEGAWA, 43

113
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:42,775
…you're much better off in life
compared to how the rest of us are doing.

114
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:46,746
So I imagine guys like you weren't tempted
to take the money like the rest of us.

115
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:50,983
For me, an actor who struggles sometimes,

116
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:55,088
that amount of money gives me
an awful lot to think about. Yeah.

117
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,190
Yeah, I can imagine.

118
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:01,194
I've never had three million yen
just dropped in my lap.

119
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,096
- Ah…
- Yeah.

120
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,965
At least we have until tomorrow morning
to think about it.

121
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,600
I know it must be tempting.

122
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,335
Have you discussed it
with your family yet?

123
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,671
Yeah, I should do that. You're right.

124
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,357
Damn.

125
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,776
Oh my God.

126
00:06:58,284 --> 00:06:59,318
Hmm.

127
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,472
<i>Anyone wishing to drop out,</i>

128
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,208
<i>please proceed</i>
<i>to the entrance of the camp.</i>

129
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,778
<i>Remember, you must be first in line.</i>

130
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:50,403
<i>Attention.</i>

131
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,306
<i>One of you has decided</i>
<i>to leave the competition</i>

132
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,375
<i>and will take home three million yen.</i>

133
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:58,578
<i>Therefore,</i>

134
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:02,648
<i>the final prize is now 27 million yen.</i>

135
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:08,955
<i>All remaining athletes,</i>
<i>make your way to the fire pit.</i>

136
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,603
<i>I'm not leaving, no way.</i>

137
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:30,943
<i>The previous team battle</i>
<i>was honestly such a meaningful experience.</i>

138
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,945
<i>That moment meant so much to me.</i>

139
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,582
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>I don't blame the person that left.</i>

140
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,332
<i>I can't drop out. I just can't do it.</i>

141
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,038
Hey, Itoi. Good morning.

142
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,575
- Morning.
- That was a surprise!

143
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,077
It really was. I knew you would stay.

144
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:06,279
I knew Itoi wouldn't go.

145
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:09,382
I just can't believe our team is now

146
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:11,817
missing one member.

147
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,387
- Somebody has dropped out.
- Someone has left. One person. Yes.

148
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,923
It's kind of sad, you know?

149
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:20,059
- Yeah, I know. It is kind of sad.
- I mean, we were a team.

150
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,695
And we probably won't see them again.

151
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:23,896
- That's right.
- Yeah.

152
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,198
- He's not here anymore.
- You're right.

153
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:29,468
- Didn't even get to say goodbye.
- Didn't have time to for one last chat.

154
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,974
Oh, Oni.

155
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,776
- Morning.
- Oni.

156
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,177
Our boy Oni!

157
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,712
Oni.

158
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:40,947
Hey, guys, what's up?

159
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,351
- Who was it?
- Yeah, that's what we're wondering.

160
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,653
- We have no idea.
- I didn't think anyone would leave.

161
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,721
Me neither.

162
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,389
I have no clue.

163
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,358
How's your body?

164
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,560
I feel like my shoulder is a little sore,
you know?

165
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,430
Soreness may have been a factor too.

166
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,533
If you woke up today
and your body was super sore,

167
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,968
you may have decided to quit.

168
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,904
- Yeah, that's possible.
- It could have been a big factor.

169
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,106
If so, maybe it was Hasegawa.

170
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,375
- Really?
- Maybe not.

171
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,711
Once a champion, always a champion.

172
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,279
He can never quit, you know?

173
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,147
I mean, I wanna believe that he stayed.

174
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,184
Ah, who was it?

175
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,486
Who could it be?

176
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:21,587
Oh!

177
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,759
Here comes the champion.

178
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,461
- I'm relieved.
- Champion!

179
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:29,795
- Good morning.
- Hey.

180
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:30,863
- Hey.
- Morning. Hey.

181
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,932
- Morning.
- Oh, be careful.

182
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,636
- Only two left.
- One of those two.

183
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:39,505
Yeah. It's either Kenta or Yone.

184
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,273
One of them.

185
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,343
To be honest, my feeling is,

186
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,579
I'm kind of torn.

187
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:48,781
So it's tempting.

188
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,852
I can't deny that I'm thinking about it.
Mm.

189
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:55,421
Yone has a family he has to consider.

190
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,324
- He's not just competing for himself.
- True.

191
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,160
<i>You gotta win.</i>

192
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,697
<i>Three million yen is still a lot of money.</i>

193
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,136
It's kind of sad, you know?

194
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,905
One of our teammates will be gone.

195
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:16,909
Oh my God.

196
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,180
Oh my God.

197
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:22,982
Wow!

198
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,618
- That's right.
- Seriously?

199
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,619
Here we go.

200
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,354
That's all of us.

201
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,122
Wow. Look at that!

202
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,828
- There we go.
- Incredible!

203
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,363
- Hey there.
- Welcome.

204
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,698
Thank you. Thank you.

205
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:40,966
Wow, I've got goosebumps.

206
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,370
Oh my God.

207
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,372
It was Kenta.

208
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,008
- Kenta, yeah.
- Kenta, yeah.

209
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,609
Kenta.

210
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:56,615
<i>Far away is the world I’ve dreamed</i>
<i>When I had my time</i>

211
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,787
<i>Now I’m left with the ghost of a life</i>
<i>And I called it mine</i>

212
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:06,692
<i>Faded lights, all the cheers have died</i>

213
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:10,429
<i>I look back, and now I dream another…</i>

214
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,731
<i>Now I’m here…</i>

215
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,966
From the moment this competition started,

216
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,503
I've… been at the bottom.

217
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:22,575
If anything, I've succeeded
'cause everyone else has supported me.

218
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,677
And I realized

219
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,680
I won't make it
to the top of the rankings.

220
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,882
I've always felt that.

221
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:34,820
But… I still wanted to compete with them.

222
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,590
I was truly torn.

223
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,127
Let's all move up
to the high-scorers group tomorrow.

224
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:46,332
<i>Happy birthday, dear Hayasaka! </i>

225
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,334
Win the 30 million,
and buy you a new tooth.

226
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:49,902
You'll win it all for me?

227
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,070
Yes.

228
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,077
I would like to drop out.

229
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,447
<i>If you drop out,</i>

230
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:06,152
<i>we have prepared a case</i>
<i>containing three million yen.</i>

231
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,420
<i>Take it with you.</i>

232
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:12,658
<i>But do not speak to anyone</i>
<i>as you leave the camp and return home.</i>

233
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,164
My father encouraged me to play rugby.

234
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,933
I dreamed that I'd make
Japan's national rugby team,

235
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,235
and I promised him he'd watch me play.

236
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:27,273
But then, one day, out of the blue,
I was diagnosed with a brain condition

237
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,041
and I knew my dream wouldn't come true.

238
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,744
But I still wanted
to express my gratitude.

239
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,846
Now that I have three million yen,

240
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:37,183
we can go on a vacation
with the entire family,

241
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:41,654
so I can at least offer them
a small portion of my gratitude.

242
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,193
This experience showed me
that I'm not a top-tier athlete.

243
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:51,664
And I'm not talking about
muscular strength or physical ability.

244
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,732
I'm saying, as a person…

245
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,507
I still have many hurdles to overcome.

246
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,310
Ultimately, that's what I learned.

247
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,825
He must've thought about
that decision long and hard.

248
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,160
Mm.

249
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:26,098
Maybe it felt unfeasible for him
to climb to the top spot.

250
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,933
- He was always at the bottom.
- Yeah.

251
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,002
Just doing what he could
to avoid being eliminated.

252
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,471
- Yeah.
- It was a safe choice for sure.

253
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,340
He'll be able to add to his savings.

254
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:37,109
- Totally.
- To be honest, I was torn about it too.

255
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,312
For me, my initial thought was, like,

256
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,683
I should go back to be with my family.
I considered it for a moment.

257
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,453
I talked it out for a while with my wife,

258
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,722
and she said, "Don't you dare give up.

259
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:50,956
- "Not cool."
- I see.

260
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:54,493
If my wife had told me to come home,
I would have left.

261
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,029
It's true. It's not just about you.

262
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,332
So does it mean
that the five of us will battle?

263
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,868
- It seems so.
- I think so.

264
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,107
15 HOURS EARLIER

265
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,112
What?

266
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:16,849
<i>You will battle one another</i>
<i>for one remaining spot.</i>

267
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,918
<i>You can consider this a redemption match.</i>

268
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:19,852
<i>Wow.</i>

269
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,888
<i>Your next challenge</i>
<i>will be the Gray Stage.</i>

270
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,356
One spot.

271
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,291
MASAYUKI SHIMOKAWA, 35

272
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,191
Just one spot.

273
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,092
KAZUHIRO GOYA, 31

274
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,394
<i>This stage</i>

275
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,196
<i>will be a true test of power.</i>

276
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,164
Testing our power.

277
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,802
I will say,
it's a true pleasure to compete again.

278
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,804
It feels a little cruel,

279
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:42,541
because it means
we battle against our own teammates.

280
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:47,680
We've just started to figure out
how to work together as a team.

281
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,348
And now, to win this challenge,

282
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,483
we have to fight against each other.

283
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,721
<i>I still want the chance</i>
<i>to compete, to prove myself,</i>

284
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,156
<i>earn my spot at the top,</i>

285
00:15:57,222 --> 00:16:00,259
<i>and win the money.</i>
<i>I'm thrilled to get a second chance.</i>

286
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:06,565
- We have a chance. Let's go.
- We have a chance.

287
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,635
Huh? What?

288
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,370
Are you serious?

289
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,372
- You're kidding.
- I see.

290
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,709
- Really?
- It's pretty simple.

291
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:20,679
<i>In the Gray Stage,</i>
<i>you'll earn the right to keep competing</i>

292
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,983
<i>through an old-fashioned tug of war.</i>

293
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:25,184
Tug of war?

294
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,086
It's simple.

295
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,590
<i>The challenge is structured</i>
<i>as a one-on-one tournament.</i>

296
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:37,162
<i>Pull the rope and drag your opponent</i>
<i>into the sea of flames to win.</i>

297
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:42,201
<i>Sometimes, you must drag a teammate down</i>
<i>for you to move up.</i>

298
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:45,471
<i>Prove you have what it takes</i>
<i>to do what's necessary.</i>

299
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,407
Koji has to be
the strongest guy out of all of us.

300
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,476
No, no.

301
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:53,112
My weight is an advantage.
But you never know.

302
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:54,780
<i>I got this.</i>

303
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,548
I'll finish in first place.

304
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:57,683
KOJI TOKUDA, 36

305
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,686
How can I optimize
my overall physical strength

306
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,021
to win the battle?

307
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,556
That's all I'm thinking about.

308
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:07,026
I have to use
every ounce of strength I have.

309
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,160
RYOSUKE MIYAGUNI (32)

310
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:12,898
<i>You will now decide</i>
<i>who will battle each other</i>

311
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:15,234
<i>for the first round of the tournament.</i>

312
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,168
We decide?

313
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,137
REDEMPTION MATCH

314
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,773
I want a good seed. A good first seed.

315
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:22,975
This is a traditional tournament.

316
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,643
<i>Among the six of you,</i>

317
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,312
<i>the athlete with the highest ranking</i>

318
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,448
<i>is Yuya Shozui.</i>

319
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,751
<i>He'll be in the most favorable block,</i>

320
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,353
<i>which is block A.</i>

321
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:38,724
<i>Choose an opponent to battle</i>
<i>in the first round of the challenge.</i>

322
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,459
Seriously?

323
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,530
- Really?
- No way.

324
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,999
I can't believe it's like this.

325
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,968
Koji is the strongest

326
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:53,305
when it comes to
the best overall combination of weight,

327
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,742
coupled with power.
I was thinking it would be better

328
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,611
to get him out of the way
right from the start.

329
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:03,649
But then I decided I should win one first.

330
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,084
Masayuki.

331
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,589
- Shall we battle?
- Okay.

332
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,793
<i>Out of everyone, I weigh the least.</i>

333
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,463
<i>I honestly expected to be chosen first.</i>

334
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,465
<i>But he'll be surprised.</i>

335
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:22,401
<i>I won't let him win quite so easily.</i>

336
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:25,871
<i>And now</i>
<i>the athlete with the next highest ranking.</i>

337
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,873
<i>Atsushi Arai.</i>

338
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:31,110
<i>Arai will be in the B block.</i>

339
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,447
<i>Select an opponent you would like to fight</i>
<i>in the first round.</i>

340
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:37,950
Okay.

341
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,553
Miyaguni. Let's battle.

342
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,423
From the start of this competition,

343
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,560
I've wanted to defeat players
that come from major sports.

344
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,563
That's the main reason

349

- Exciting.
- Definitely.

358
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,738
- They're so different physically.
- Yeah.

359
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,674
I wonder if body mass
will make a difference, you know?

360
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,912
My opponent has done pretty well
in past events,

361
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,748
always ranked as a top scorer.

362
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,584
In terms of overall physical capability,

363
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:48,086
I think he definitely has the advantage.

364
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:51,490
It feels like a match
between a winner and a survivor.

365
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,625
It'll be a show for sure.

366
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,461
As you saw in the first stage,
climbing the mountain,

367
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,333
I think that I'm pretty strong physically,
and I have that fighting spirit.

368
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,303
I'll defeat my opponent.

370
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,741

371
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:12,945
<i>At the sound of the buzzer, please begin.</i>

372
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,182

373
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,427

Wow, he's stronger.

376
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,811
- Just keep holding on. Keep it up.
- Use the bump.

377
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,646
- Keep it up.
- Keep your feet on it.

378
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,720
- We knew he was gonna be strong.
- So strong.

379
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:32,691
- You good?
- I'm fine.

380
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,460
Their size difference was a factor.

381
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:37,596
Well…

382
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:42,034

00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:31,522
That in the end, we're the strongest.
No matter what,

517
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:35,627
in a competition where they've assembled
the best from every sport,

518
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:37,595
I want baseball to come out on top.

519
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,964
- I want people to recognize it.
- Yeah.

520
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,233
Let's give it everything we have.
Seriously.

521
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,534
Yeah. Everything.

522
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,839
- Both of them are super strong.
- Yeah.

523
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:52,110
It'll be crazy
if Miyaguni wins this battle.

524
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,646
- Yeah, that'd be incredible.
- That'd be wild.

525
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:57,215
- It'd turn the tables.
- It could totally happen.

526
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,618
Good luck to you both.

527
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:04,589
<i>At the sound of the buzzer, please begin.</i>
