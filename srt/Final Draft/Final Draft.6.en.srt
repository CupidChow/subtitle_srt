1
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:09,542
<i>At the sound of the buzzer, please begin.</i>

2
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,168
Who's gonna win?

3
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,254
A little more.

4
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,597
That's not good.

5
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,935
- Bravo.
- Nice work!

6
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:42,902
Yeah!

7
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,540
- So strong.
- Strong. Amazing.

8
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,176
Wow.

9
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:56,382
Well,

10
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,651
of course, I have no regrets.

11
00:01:58,718 --> 00:01:59,652
RYOSUKE MIYAGUNI, 32

12
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,588
Yeah.

13
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:05,758
I hope Shozui does his best
and wins it all.

14
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:07,494
Thank you.

15
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,630
- Great job.
- Yeah, awesome.

16
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:17,403
<i>That's it for me,</i>
<i>but I was up against so many athletes.</i>

17
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,074
<i>In the end, I'm just grateful</i>
<i>that I got to compete against them</i>

18
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,208
<i>and get to know them.</i>

19
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,611
<i>This was such a meaningful experience.</i>

20
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:29,516
<i>I feel very lucky to have been a part</i>
<i>of such an incredible competition.</i>

21
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,686
<i>The athlete who will return</i>
<i>to Final Draft is</i>

22
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,523
<i>Yuya Shozui.</i>

23
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,424
- Nice job!
- Nice!

24
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,297
Uh,

25
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:46,065
I'll represent

26
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,869
everyone who competed today.

27
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:53,873
I'm returning to the competition
with that in mind.

28
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,643
I'm not just competing for myself,

29
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,112
but for all the other athletes here.

30
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:03,016
So, on behalf of everyone here,

31
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,751
I'll win it all.

32
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:06,786
- Thanks so much.
- Okay.

33
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,154
- Go!
- Nice.

34
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:12,358
- Nice. I'm counting on you to win.
- Let's go. You got this.

35
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,662
- Great match.
- Great job.

36
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:18,198
- Great match.
- Everyone is so strong.

37
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,166
- Nice, Shozui.
- Thank you very much.

38
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,135
- Thank you very much. Thanks so much.
- Great job.

39
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,503
- Win it all.
- Thank you.

40
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,904
- Promise me.
- You got it.

41
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:27,640
- For real, you gotta win first place.
- Thank you. Thank you.

42
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,276
You can do it.
Hang in there. You got this.

43
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:43,423
It's so cold.

44
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,025
- It's freezing.
- So cold.

45
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:48,795
It's down to five of us. Kenta bowed out.

46
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,697
It all happened so fast.

47
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,098
- It did.
- Five.

48
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,067
I have to say, I'm so grateful

49
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,536
I got to team up with all of you
in that competition.

50
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,238
- Absolutely.
- That was great.

51
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,573
I'm excited to compete against each other.

52
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,176
Doesn't get better than this.
It's the best.

53
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,411
At this point,
we know so much about each other.

54
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,413
- We do.
- What we're good at.

55
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:08,748
What?

56
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:09,949
No, no, no, no, no.

57
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,185
- Were you at batting practice?
- What's going on?

58
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,921
I'm back!

59
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,522
What do you mean you're back?

60
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,458
- I've made a comeback.
- No way!

61
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,560
As a member of Team Shozui,

62
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:22,495
I'm back.

63
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,031
- Wait, really?
- What do you mean?

64
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,734
- What's going on? Tell me.
- There was a redemption challenge.

65
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,435
Ah, that's what I thought.

66
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,838
I beat everyone
and earned a second chance.

67
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:32,739
Amazing.

68
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,108
- What was the challenge?
- It was a tug of war.

69
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,309
A tug of war, huh?

70
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,811
- Impressive.
- No way.

71
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,280
- Amazing.
- For real?

72
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,849
A fierce competitor has returned.
All right, all right.

73
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,384
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back.

74
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,418
Thank you.

75
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,920
If he won the redemption match,
he belongs here.

76
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,622
I'm confident I still belong here.

77
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,424
- May I ask one thing? Just you?
- Yeah.

78
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,725
- Just me.
- That's good.

79
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,594
Just one person. I see.

80
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,263
- We just lost one of our team members.
- Yeah, Kenta.

81
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,931
- Dropped out.
- He dropped out.

82
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,000
- He dropped out? What?!
- Dropped out.

83
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,369
He went all out
at the barbecue dinner last night.

84
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:06,606
- Then went home.
- Ate all the meat, went home.

85
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,574
It's the six of us.

86
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,110
The six of us are evenly matched.

87
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,812
Exactly.

88
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,347
- The bell.
- What?

89
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,985
<i>Everyone, may we have your attention</i>

90
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,887
<i>for an important announcement?</i>

91
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,322
- Aw, man.
- Jeez!

92
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,791
- I really hate this.
- I truly hate this!

93
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,760
- She said it's important.
- What does that mean?

94
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:32,732
<i>In the next two hours,</i>
<i>everyone will need to prepare</i>

95
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:37,270
<i>a presentation on how you plan</i>
<i>to use the prize money,</i>

96
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:41,374
<i>along with what you expect to accomplish</i>
<i>in your second career.</i>

97
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,109
Presentation?

98
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,210
Presentation?

99
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,413
<i>Your presentation</i>
<i>must be less than five minutes.</i>

100
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:52,585
<i>A guest judge will evaluate</i>
<i>and score your presentations.</i>

101
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:53,486
What?

102
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:56,656
<i>The higher you score,</i>
<i>the greater your advantage</i>

103
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,525
<i>in the semifinal stage</i>
<i>of this competition.</i>

104
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,761
- What?
- Come on, what is that about?

105
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,262
I wasn't expecting that at all.

106
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,967
- We explain how we'll use the prize money?
- Yeah.

107
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,103
That's so difficult.

108
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,839
None of us are confident
about this challenge.

109
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:16,142
- We can't use our bodies.
- Probably why they're making us do this.

110
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,910
- Somebody is coming.
- Who?

111
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,482
- Hello.
- Hello.

112
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,151
- I'm Suzuki from NowDo Inc.
- Yes.

113
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,086
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

114
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:31,357
Most of the time,
I do business with Keisuke Honda,

115
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,925
a professional soccer player.

116
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:37,663
We focus on sports and education
and have taken on other business ventures.

117
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,833
When I was in college,
I sustained an injury,

118
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,769
ending my chances as a pro soccer player.

119
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,638
So I thought about
what else I could do to build a career,

120
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,974
but I couldn't come up with anything.

121
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,676
I know that each of you
were elite athletes,

122
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:54,680
and now you've moved on with your lives
and are building other careers.

123
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,048
If you win the prize money,

124
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:59,285
I'm of the belief
that it's important to have a plan

125
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,020
for how you are going to use it.

126
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,723
I'm looking forward to your presentations.

127
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,025
- Thank you so much.
- Yes, thank you.

128
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,394
Hmm…

129
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,229
<i>What can I talk about?</i>

130
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,933
<i>It's not like I'm running</i>
<i>a whole company right now.</i>

131
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,835
<i>I'm just a normal employee.</i>

132
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,571
<i>I've never had to think about money</i>

133
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,641
<i>with this much intentional planning.</i>

134
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:22,742
Hmm…

135
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:27,680
This is it, I guess.
Oh man, I don't know. Is this good enough?

136
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,584
<i>I kind of have an idea</i>
<i>of how to use the money.</i>

137
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,653
<i>But how should I say this?</i>

138
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:37,690
Considering this current business model…

139
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:40,059
Oh, how should I say this?

140
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,164
This is so challenging.

141
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,668
It feels strange
to talk about only what I want.

142
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,573
I think I have the outline mostly done.

143
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,276
YUYA SHOZUI, 28
FORMER PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL PLAYER

144
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,816
So it's a presentation, right?
I present it.

145
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:04,717
YOSHIO ITOI (43)

146
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:08,321
SPORTS AND WELFARE
TEN YEARS AGO, I MET A BOY IN A WHEELCHAIR

147
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,993
What's another word for "support,"
to support someone?

148
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,567
<i>Attention. You will now present your plan</i>

149
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,469
<i>if you were to win the prize money.</i>

150
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:27,440
<i>You'll also share your expectations</i>
<i>for building your new career.</i>

151
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,412
<i>Each of you will rate</i>
<i>the other presentations</i>

152
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,681
<i>on a point scale, from one to five.</i>

153
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,216
PARTICIPANTS - 25

154
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:40,419
<i>Also, Suzuki,</i>
<i>our specialist in second careers,</i>

155
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:43,456

EVALUATION

157
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:51,898
<i>First presenter,</i>
<i>step forward and begin your presentation.</i>

158
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,739
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

159
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:00,940
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

160
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,876
First of all, at this point in my career,

161
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,511
I'm working as a barber.

162
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:09,115
In the future, my plan is to be on my own

163
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:10,850
and open up my own shop.

164
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,719
If win this competition
and the prize money,

165
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:18,858
I intend to use it to cover the costs
of opening the barber shop.

166
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:24,397
I calculated what it would roughly cost
each month to run the shop.

167
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:25,965
And that number…

168
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:32,338
came out to just under 1.5 million yen.

169
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:37,109
That would be enough
to cover running costs

170
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,812
for a year and a half, more or less.

171
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:43,783
During that time,
I'd make sure to build a customer base.

172
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:44,817
A solid one.

173
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,453
And, in the long run, my goal as a barber

174
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,590
is to open a series of shops
in cities across Japan.

175
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:54,794
And when it comes to how much I can earn
from each customer,

176
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,762
eventually there's gonna be a cap,

177
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,332
so I want to open many shops.

178
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,967
That's all. Thank you.

179
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:02,935
Thank you very much.

180
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,643
- Good, good. Nice work up there.
- Yeah, I don't know.

181
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,745
<i>Attention. The next presenter,</i>

182
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,548
<i>step forward and begin your presentation.</i>

183
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:18,651
Thank you.

184
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:20,386
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

185
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,556
So if I were to win the competition
and the prize money,

186
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,493
my plan is this.
I want to open a sports facility

187
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:31,330
for baseball players,
focusing on body and mind.

188
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,567
During my days as a player,

189
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,168
I struggled mentally,

190
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,804
which made it extremely difficult
to play at times.

191
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:43,476
Now I want to help as many coaches
and athletes as possible if I win.

192
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:47,046
So this is how I will use
the 27 million yen.

193
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,347
My plan is

194
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,883
to start up my business in Osaka.

195
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,519
I wanna use
a warehouse in a suburban area,

196
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,988
which means
I'll have to substantially invest

197
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,390
in designing the interior.

198
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,058
That's my idea.

199
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,795
My goal is to spend
less than 20 million yen on the interior.

200
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,930
With the remaining seven million yen,

201
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:09,402
I'll use it to cover personnel,
maintenance, and bills.

202
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:13,072
That is how I plan to use the money.
After retiring from my career,

203
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,940
I decided I needed more training.

204
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,244
I became certified
as a mental performance coach for sports.

205
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,714
My plan is to keep on learning
and building my skills

206
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,983
so I can help a larger number of people.

207
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,686
And, of course,
I'd make good use of my certification.

208
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:27,620
That's all.

209
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,364
<i>Next presenter, please step forward</i>

210
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,166
<i>and begin your presentation.</i>

211
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,868
HOZUMI HASEGAWA, 43
FORMER BOXING WORLD CHAMPION

212
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,704
- Happy to be here.
- Good luck.

213
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,874
A few years ago,
in 2018, I opened my own boxing gym.

214
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,877
Initially, when we opened,
the idea was to give people

215
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:56,215
who really didn't have
any boxing experience a chance to try it.

216
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,817
We've been open almost six years,

217
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,686
and now the gym is
a place for professionals to train.

218
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,722
I have two plans for the money.

219
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:07,093
First, I want to pass on knowledge
of what helped me in my career.

220
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,627
I wanna share the techniques

221
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:12,164
that I've held onto over the years
with younger fighters.

222
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,265
The second thing,

223
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:17,336
many amateur boxers decide
to move to the Kanto region of Japan

224
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,471
when they go pro.

225
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:23,976
There are way more training opportunities
and higher payouts in Kanto.

226
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,512
I became a world champion in Kobe,

227
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,013
in the Kansai region.

228
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,151
So one of my goals is to train
a strong boxer, a world champion,

229
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,086
who comes from the Kansai region.

230
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,489
To conclude, if I win the prize money,

231
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:40,659
I want to use it to help build
a better training environment for boxers

232
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,996
who have great potential.
That's how I'll use the money.

233
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,297
Thank you so much.

234
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:54,707
<i>And now the next presenter.</i>
<i>Please begin your presentation.</i>

235
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,878
There are two ways
I plan to use the money.

236
00:12:58,944 --> 00:12:59,912
RYUDAI ONIKURA, 30

237
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,114
First of all, I'll help my mother.

238
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:05,117
For as long as I can remember,

239
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,721
my mom raised me on her own.

240
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,222
We didn't have much,

241
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,159
but she never let on
how difficult things were.

242
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:16,362
I'm sure she went through
a lot of tough times.

243
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,597
Once I win the prize money,

244
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:22,802
I think
I would like to give most of it to her.

245
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,772
I'd like to show her
just how… grateful I am.

246
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,210
My other plan is to invest in myself.

247
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,779
Right now, I'm pursuing acting,

248
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,515
but I'm still just starting out.

249
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:40,853
I barely make a living
with what I make as an actor.

250
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,457
I have to work extra hours
at my part-time job to make ends meet.

251
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:49,829
To that end,
I need to develop my skills as an actor,

252
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:54,066
which means taking classes
in performance and vocal technique.

253
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,302
Those are expensive.

254
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,373
Both classes combined
cost around 600,000 yen per year,

255
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,276
which is three million over five years.

256
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,947
During those five years,
I plan to work hard,

257
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,782
improve my skills as an actor,

258
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,984
and book roles in lots of productions.

259
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:12,885
That's it.

260
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:16,789
Thank you.

261
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,426
I was so nervous.

262
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,030
<i>And now the next presenter.</i>
<i>Please begin your presentation.</i>

263
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:30,102
Wow, this is nerve-racking.

264
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,371
This one makes me the most nervous.

265
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,341
Okay, so, actually…

266
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:36,242
YOSHIO ITOI (43)

267
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:40,646
…just a little while after I retired
from playing baseball,

268
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:45,284
I started working
in the area of social services.

269
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,554
And what inspired me to do it was,

270
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,357
I went to see
a game of wheelchair softball

271
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:54,827
while I was still playing pro baseball.

272
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,528
When I was there, I met a young boy.

273
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:59,632
His goal was to become
a pro baseball player.

274
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:02,334
He worked super hard
throughout his years in college.

275
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,036
But one day, on his way to practice,

276
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:08,073
he got into a car accident,
and he was severely injured.

277
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,141
Paralyzed.

278
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:10,943
And that could've been me.

279
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,578
Seriously, if that had happened to me,

280
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,314
I… I would have been
completely devastated,

281
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,750
you know? it would have been unbearable.

282
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:19,318
But that guy,

283
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,787
he was playing wheelchair softball,

284
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,089
and he still had a big smile on his face.

285
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,824
Instead of me inspiring him,

286
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,860
he was the one that inspired me.

287
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:32,298
Wheelchairs designed for sports
are extremely expensive,

288
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:36,802
around 200,000 yen each.
Twenty million yen for a hundred of them.

289
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,437
So if I win the prize money,

290
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,140
instead of using it for my own business,

291
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,778
I want to use it to support these athletes

292
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,780
with what they need to play. That's all.

293
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:56,522
<i>Next presenter,</i>
<i>please begin your presentation.</i>

294
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:58,290
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

295
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,159
Now that I'm retired from football,

296
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:03,062
I'm running my own training program
for athletes.

297
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,064
At my academy, I teach techniques

298
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,466
to help people strengthen their abilities,

299
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,668
no matter what sport they play.

300
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:14,707
The challenge I'm facing is,
I'm doing everything on my own right now.

301
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:19,611
So I feel like I've hit my limit
with how much I can scale the academy.

302
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:23,115
So, in the future,
I want to start by expanding my business.

303
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:27,820
To expand it, I have to recruit members
who can also teach.

304
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:32,291
That way, I can focus all my time,
energy, and abilities elsewhere.

305
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,292
So that's one thing.

306
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:37,963
I've also been hoping to diversify
by developing a training app.

307
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,100
I believe developing
a video streaming application

308
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,702
that allows an athlete
to train on their own,

309
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,439
both physically and mentally,
is something no one in Japan has done yet.

310
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,809
I'm confident I could create
a useful training app.

311
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:54,046
But to develop it, I would need
a tremendous amount of money,

312
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:57,349
and I would be taking on
an incredible amount of risk.

313
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,351
In the end, if I win this prize money,

314
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:02,187
building an app
is something I'm eager to try.

315
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,657
So by taking this kind of initiative,

316
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:09,128
I hope I'm able to energize
the world of sports.

317
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,863
That's all. Thank you very much.

318
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,537
Thank you for your presentations.

319
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:22,574
So I created
a set of three different criteria

320
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,176
to score your presentations.

321
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,477
The first was passion.

322
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:26,812
I have no doubt

323
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,815
that you're all very passionate
about your future goals.

324
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,952
I scored you on how you expressed it.
That was worth the most points.

325
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,622
The second score was for your plan.

326
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,957
Were you able
to clearly explain your intentions

327
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:42,227
for executing your plan
in a specific timeframe.

328
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:45,397
The remaining points
were for your financial plan.

329
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,600
If you receive 27 million yen
without a solid plan,

330
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,169
you could wind up losing it all.

331
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,772
And, if you lose it, you might not be able
to think about what to do next.

332
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,908
So, in the end,
I based my scoring decisions

333
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,143
on those three specific criteria.

334
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:02,281
Okay, now I will announce the total scores

335
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,116
for each of your presentations.

336
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,456
- Starting with Yonemura.
- Okay.

337
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:13,058
Kurihara gave you three points.

338
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,593
Onikura,

339
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,028
three points.

340
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,329
Itoi, five points.

341
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,198
Hasegawa, three.

342
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,699
Shozui, three points.

343
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,769
I gave you 11 points
for a total of 28 points.

344
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,472
- That's so average!
- It's brutal.

345
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,340
28 points. That's rough.

346
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,709
- He's saying what we gave…
- That's harsh.

347
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,211
- Now Kurihara.
- Okay.

348
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,179
Yonemura gave five points.

349
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,548
- Onikura, five points.
- Thanks.

350
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,749
Itoi, five points.

351
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:38,817
Wow, seriously?

352
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:42,488
- Hasegawa, 4.5.
- You gave me 4.5? Thank you.

353
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,089
Shozui, five points.

354
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,225
I gave you 13 points.

355
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,127
That's a total of 37.5.

356
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,596
- Lot of points. A high score.
- Thank you very much.

357
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,766
Onikura, your turn.

358
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,703
- Yeah.
- So Yonemura gave three points.

359
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:00,139
- Kurihara, two points.
- Ugh, sorry.

360
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,573
Itoi, five points.

361
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,209
Hasegawa gave you three points.

362
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:05,377
Shozui, two.

363
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:08,480
I gave 12 points, so you have 27 points.

364
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,017
Sorry.

365
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,952
Seriously. Seriously.

366
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,855
- It was tough, wasn't it?
- No, it's fine. It is what it is.

367
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,391
- I get how you feel.
- It is what it is.

368
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,726
It's a competition.

369
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,828
Itoi's next. Yonemura gave three.

370
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,998
Kurihara, three points.
Onikura, four points.

371
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,299
Hasegawa, three.

Shozui, four points.

373
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,737
I gave ten points. That's a total of 27.

374
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,005
Thank you very much.

375
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,543
Now for Hasegawa.

376
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,112
Yonemura gave three points.

377
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,680
Kurihara, four points.

378
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,082
Onikura, four. Itoi, five.

379
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:47,119
Shozui, four points, and I gave 11 points.

380
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,488
- That's a total of 31.
- Thank you very much.

381
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,692
Okay. Finally, Shozui's points.

382
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,028

And I gave 13,
so that's a total of 32 points.

387
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,776
<i>The higher you're ranked,</i>
<i>the greater your advantage</i>

388
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,244
1. TAKASHI KURIHARA
2. YUYA SHOZUI

389
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,246
<i>…as you all move on</i>
<i>to the semifinal challenge.</i>

390
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,481
Did you give everyone five?

391
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,017
Yeah, of course I did.
They all spoke to me.

392
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,586
- Thank you.
- He's kind.

393
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,454
- I wasn't being lazy.
- Yeah, I know.

394
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,790
I thought a lot about your mom.

395
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,062
<i>Everyone, amazing work.</i>

396
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:34,099
<i>Please ensure to rest up</i>
<i>to prepare for the semifinal.</i>

397
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,372
KATSUMA YONEMURA, 28

398
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,373
HIFUMI ABE, 27

399
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,775
<i>Come on. Look at that.</i>
<i>Got that athlete vibe.</i>

400
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,979
Got that athlete intensity, right?

401
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,381
<i>The two of us met during college</i>

402
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:52,084
<i>and did judo together</i>
<i>throughout our time there.</i>

403
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,785
<i>And then you became a barber.</i>

404
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,655
<i>I think it's really cool</i>
<i>that, after your judo career,</i>

405
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,790
<i>you're still making your dreams come true.</i>

406
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,926
<i>I'm always cheering you on</i>

407
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,328
<i>from behind the scenes.</i>

408
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:05,597
<i>I've always got your back.</i>

409
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:09,034
So you know how I always used to lose
by getting pinned?

410
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,302
- <i>Yeah, you did.</i>
- Right?

411
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:13,005
For me, I feel like all my regrets

412
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,241
or disappointments about judo

413
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,943
are completely in the past.

414
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,014
But sometimes, I have nightmares
about getting pinned.

415
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:26,385
Maybe I'm still not over it after all.

416
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,320
<i>Yeah, sounds like you're not over it yet.</i>

417
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,955
- Crazy, right?
- <i>Come on, let that go.</i>

418
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:31,089
It's pretty crazy.

419
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,325
You know, I want to approach this show

420
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:37,296
with the same mindset that I had in judo

421
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:39,464
and cleanse myself of past regrets.

422
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:42,668
<i>Then, I mean, you gotta win it all.</i>

423
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,670
<i>Finish your journey</i>
<i>as the best athlete there.</i>

424
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:45,737
You're right.

425
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,507
So please pray
I make it all the way to the end.

426
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,142
- <i>Hang in there.</i>
- Thanks.

427
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,411
I know you have my back.

428
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,784
Good evening.

429
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,420
TARO HAYASHIDA
BOXING TEAM COACH

430
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,289
- <i>You're still as handsome as ever.</i>
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, thanks.

431
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,426
Hey, did you know,
when I was young, my original plan

432
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,462
was to quit boxing
right after my third year of high school?

433
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:12,731
- <i>Wow, I didn't know that.</i>
- Oh, you didn't?

434
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,767
I was scouted
by a few different universities.

435
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:19,738
But I chose one where I could be
a big fish in a small pond

436
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,206
and not have to work too hard.

437
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:22,774
I thought I was being clever,

438
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:24,910
but I was wrong.

439
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:27,446
The reason I ended up
at Komazawa University

440
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:30,048
is because my grandmother encouraged me.

441
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,417
You were pretty persistent as well.

442
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:37,789
<i>Yeah, for sure. I think you work harder</i>
<i>when someone's relying on you.</i>

443
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:38,824
Right.

444
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:42,894
<i>I've seen it. It looks like someone else</i>
<i>is making you do the work.</i>

445
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:43,962
<i>That's how it seemed.</i>

446
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:47,566
<i>Now you're working as an actor,</i>
<i>so this is new territory.</i>

447
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,067
- <i>You truly wanna win.</i>
- Yes.

448
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:51,970
<i>You're not doing this</i>
<i>for anyone but yourself.</i>

449
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,539
<i>I've wanted to tell you that</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

450
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:55,674
<i>This is your ship,</i>

451
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,509
<i>and you are the captain of it.</i>

452
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,444
<i>I've been telling you this all along.</i>

453
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,179
<i>I honestly think it's great</i>

454
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,915
<i>you're finally inspired</i>
<i>to give it everything you've got.</i>

455
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:08,453
<i>So I hope you'll do the best you can,</i>
<i>no matter how hard it gets.</i>

456
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,521
Yeah.

457
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,857
- I understand.
- <i>Okay.</i>

458
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,558
Thank you very much.

459
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,431
- Justine.
- <i>Am I on?</i>

460
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:21,800
Now's not the time to be feeding the baby.

461
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,702
Baylee!

462
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,238
Looking super cute, as always!

463
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:28,039
<i>How is it being away from us?</i>

464
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,708
Oh, I feel lonely.

465
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,177
But the thing is,
I haven't lost my determination, you know?

466
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,845
2024
MOVED TO HAWAII AS A FAMILY OF FOUR

467
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,714
<i>Oh, I'm sure you'll win.</i>

468
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:38,984
- <i>It's no good if you don't win.</i>
- That's tough. But you're right.

469
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:41,686
I agree. I have to win.

470
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,022
<i>I mean, I know you're capable of winning.</i>

471
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,524
<i>It's just that, until now,</i>

472
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,527
<i>there hasn't been a place</i>
<i>where you could show your true potential.</i>

473
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,895
Mm.

474
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,696
I swear, I'm gonna win this

475
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:55,000
and show everyone what I'm capable of.

476
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,769
- <i>We're all rooting for you over here.</i>
- Okay.

477
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,439
I'll do my best. Thank you.

478
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,120
- Hey. Morning.
- Morning.

479
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:16,054
Morning.

480
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,924
- Morning. Morning.
- Hey, what's up?

481
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,193
It feels like
the competition is finally real.

482
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,762
- It's serious business now.
- I know, right?

483
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,431
- It all depends on the challenge.
- Yeah, on the sport.

484
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,700
Regardless, you're pretty strong, Takashi.

485
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:29,968
Yeah, that's true.

486
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,670
But it's still anyone's game.

487
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:33,104
You're good at presenting.

488
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,508
The rice balls
they set out for us are pretty small.

489
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,410
First meal as a low scorer.

490
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:41,146
- Give a speech, Shozui.
- Yeah.

491
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:44,316
It's my first meal
in the low scorer group.

492
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,052
- Yeah.
- It's definitely not the same.

493
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,555
But, you know, I'll enjoy this meal.

494
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:53,458
And the top three
are probably getting confident now.

495
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,228
- So let's destroy them.
- Yeah, sounds good.

496
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:59,197
Today, we win and move on
to the finals. The three of us.

497
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:00,365
Okay!

498
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:01,833
Hands together. Thanks.

499
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,168
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

500
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:06,605
I wonder what the challenge is today.

501
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,410
What's today's test?

502
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:20,552
- Wow, there are so few of us left.
- Yeah.

503
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,821
- So true.
- Down to six people.

504
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,856
- One of us will win.
- Twenty-seven million.

505
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,192
- Somebody will.
- That's for sure.

506
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,561
That's right.

507
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,063
Here we go.

508
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:33,999
Here it comes.

509
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:36,134
- What color?
- My heart is pounding.

510
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,870
<i>The next stage is the Purple Stage.</i>

511
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:43,608
<i>You'll be tested on your ability</i>
<i>to push through.</i>

512
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:45,944
- An ability to push through?
- What?

513
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,914
- Like, break a limb and keep going?
- I mean, it can't be that simple.

514
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,848
I mean, maybe.

515
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,783
<i>Please proceed to the stage.</i>

516
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,386
- Here we go!
- Bring it on.

517
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,192
- Wow.
- Here it is.

518
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,995
- Here we go!
- Hold on a sec. This isn't built for me.

519
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:04,963
What?

520
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:15,040
- It's a ring.
- A ring.

521
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,541
A boxing ring.

522
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:19,778
When I saw the boxing ring,
I was like, "There we go."

523
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,647
If we're doing anything resembling boxing,

524
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:26,351
I think I stand a good chance
of advancing, given my skill set.

525
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,720
Look at that. It says "Mystery Fighter."

526
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,388
A mystery fighter?

527
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:33,892
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>Please view the neighboring challenge.</i>

528
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,226
What? There's more?

529
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:37,095
- Two places?
- Over there?

530
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,699
- Another challenge?
- Different sports?

531
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,467
- Hold on.
- What's going on?

532
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,202
- This is crazy.
- What?

533
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,570
Whoa, wait a sec.

534
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:48,974
No, I'm not so sure about this.

535
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,811
This looks incredible.

536
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:54,512
What is this? Huh?

537
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,281
It looks tough. What is it?

538
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:59,851
<i>The Purple Stage will test</i>
<i>your ability to push through.</i>

539
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:02,420
<i>There is Touch Boxing</i>

540
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:04,522
<i>and Chase Tag.</i>

541
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:06,658
<i>For this challenge,</i>

542
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:10,328
<i>you will compete against</i>
<i>each sport's top athletes.</i>

543
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,564
- So a new challenger?
- Oh, I get it.

544
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,435
I'll be facing a new fighter,

545
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:20,538
which fires up my competitive instincts,
you know?

546
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,340
I feel relieved, to be honest,

547
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,843
that we're not competing
against each other.

548
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:28,647
<i>Before we begin,</i>
<i>the person who scored highest</i>

549
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:31,349
<i>on their presentation</i>
<i>in the previous round</i>

550
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:35,553
<i>will be able to choose which sport</i>
<i>they would like to compete in.</i>

551
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,055
Oh, we choose one.

552
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,958
<i>You'll be choosing</i>
<i>Touch Boxing or Chase Tag.</i>

553
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:44,963
<i>The first athlete to win in each sport</i>
<i>will move on to the final stage,</i>

554
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,599
<i>meaning there will be two finalists.</i>

555
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:51,636
So if the first person wins,
then the competition's over right away?

556
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,271
- I see how it works.
- What?

557
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,773
<i>Please note,</i>

558
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:59,177
<i>all of the athletes</i>
<i>will continue to compete</i>

559
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,212
<i>until a winner is decided.</i>

560
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:05,850
<i>And now I will introduce</i>
<i>the fighters for each sport.</i>

561
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:07,085
- Okay.
- Here it comes.

562
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,654
<i>First, for Chase Tag,</i>

563
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,089
<i>the fighter is…</i>

564
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:18,163
- Wow. Super agile.
- Hold on, no way!

565
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:19,964
Impressive.

566
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,333
<i>Yuutarou.</i>

567
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:26,404
<i>He's a member</i>
<i>of Japan's national parkour team</i>

568
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:28,306
<i>and has competed in world competitions.</i>

569
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,075
- Seriously?
- That's crazy.

570
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:32,343
- National team, huh? Come on.
- No way. He's too good.

571
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:36,247
<i>At the buzzer,</i>
<i>the Chase Tag match will begin,</i>

572
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,049
<i>and Yuutarou will chase you.</i>

573
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:41,886
<i>Evade him for 20 seconds</i>
<i>without getting tagged and you'll win.</i>

574
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:46,858
<i>Also, the challenger will choose</i>
<i>where to start the chase.</i>

575
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:51,863
<i>Stay within the court,</i>
<i>and start from any spot you'd like.</i>

576
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:54,399
Dang, that's hard. This is tough.

577
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,901
- I'll get tagged in seconds.
- Yeah, me too.

578
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,972
<i>Next up, the fighter for Touch Boxing is…</i>

579
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:09,481
<i>…Shinsuke Yamanaka.</i>

580
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,884
- It's Yamanaka.
- It's Yamanaka.

581
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:15,186
- Yamanaka's really here. Wow.
- Amazing.

582
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:20,125
<i>Armed with "God's Left Fist," he's</i>
<i>a former WBC Bantamweight Champion</i>

583
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:24,763
<i>who defended his world title,</i>
<i>and won, a total of 12 times.</i>

584
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,800
<i>In round one there's no time limit.</i>

585
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:33,438
<i>To win, you need to touch</i>
<i>two of the four sensors</i>

586
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,974
<i>located on his arms and torso.</i>

587
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:38,543
You have to touch two of them first.

588
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,712
No way you can do this
if you haven't boxed before.

589
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,648
I never imagined a guy
like Shinsuke Yamanaka

590
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:45,617
would participate in this competition.

591
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:50,121
If I choose boxing,
I don't know if I'd win against Yamanaka.

592
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,289
It won't be easy.

593
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,358
I'm sure it'll be a tough fight.

594
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:57,028
<i>To defeat these top-level athletes,</i>

595
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,830
<i>prove your ability to push through</i>

596
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:02,333
<i>by going above and beyond your limits</i>
<i>as a competitor.</i>

597
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,103
This is the best part about sports.

598
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,939
"Technique conquers strength,"
as the saying goes.

599
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:10,642
If I have a good strategy
facing this challenge,

600
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,111
then it all comes down to determination.

601
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:18,116
<i>The first challenger</i>
<i>of this stage is Takashi Kurihara.</i>

602
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:20,885
<i>Please tell us the sport you've chosen.</i>

603
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:22,587
Chase Tag.

604
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:27,492
<i>The challenger</i>
<i>will now proceed to the competition arena.</i>

605
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,195
- How's this gonna go?
- Seriously, I can't wait to see this.

606
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:33,131
I can't imagine how agile he's gonna be.

607
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:36,434
If Kuri gets caught easily,
we're all in trouble.

608
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,003
- Yeah, that's true.
- It's scary.

609
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,806
In terms of overall athleticism,

610
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:44,509
I'm definitely superior
to the parkour champion.

611
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:47,779
My strategy is
to try to use my physical strength

612
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,614
to evade him for 20 seconds.

613
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,516
I got speed, agility.

614
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,651
I'll win it on my first try.

615
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:55,954
<i>Attention.</i>

616
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,057
<i>At the sound of the buzzer,</i>
<i>begin the chase.</i>

617
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,136
So quick.

618
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,205
- What?
- You're kidding me!

619
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,942
- I messed up.
- <i>The winner is the fighter.</i>

620
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:20,812
- He's scary fast.
- That quick?

621
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:22,947
I've never experienced that before.

622
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,515
I come from football,

623
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:28,653
so I'm really good at
those quick changes of direction.

624
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,756
That was unbelievable.
To be honest, his speed scared me.

625
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:34,125
This is so hard.

626
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,093
Damn it.

627
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:37,862
I see you.

628
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:42,200
<i>Yuya Shozui,</i>
<i>please tell us the sport you've chosen.</i>

629
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:44,903
Chase Tag.

630
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,771
FORMER PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL PLAYER

631
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:49,841
Even though I was eliminated,

632
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,377
I came back to represent

633
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,579
and fight for the others.

634
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,750
I wanna be able to tell them
that I fought my way back and won it all.

635
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:00,818
I can't afford to lose now that I'm back.

636
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:05,189
You know, I think starting from that spot
is actually a great strategy.

637
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,258
- Good, right?
- Isn't that in the way?

638
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,460
- He could jump off that box.
- At the bottom?

639
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:10,461
But if it wasn't there,

640
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:12,597
Yuutarou could run through there
no problem.

641
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:13,765
Yeah, I see.

642
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,700
<i>Attention.</i>

643
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,168
<i>At the sound of the buzzer,</i>

644
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,803
<i>begin the chase.</i>

645
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:25,276
Oh, good. Nice fake. Nice fake.

646
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,513
- He's doing good.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

647
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:30,515
Oh, he's out.

648
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,083
Can't go there.

649
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,518
That's out of bounds.

650
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:36,154
- I see.
- Man, this is just so difficult.

651
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,490
<i>The winner is the fighter.</i>

652
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,994
In the beginning,
when Kurihara went first,

653
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:46,331
I thought,
"Okay, he just showed us what not to do."

654
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:49,400
But, to be honest,
now that I've tried it myself,

655
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:53,104
I realized just how challenging
Chase Tag really is.

656
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:54,539
Yeah.

657
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:58,810
<i>Hozumi Hasegawa,</i>
<i>please tell us the sport you've chosen.</i>

658
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:00,345
Touch Boxing, please.

659
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,681
- Can't wait.
- I wanna see this, as a fan.

660
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:06,918
- This will be an incredible match.
- This could end the boxing right here.

661
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,052
I'm so pumped.

662
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:11,022
Yeah, it's possible
that boxing will no longer be an option.

663
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:14,092
For someone like me who's boxed before,
those two are legends.

664
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,361
And they were in the same weight class.

665
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:19,430
Honestly, when it comes to a match
between those two,

666
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,100
I'm just happy to watch the fight.

667
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,370
- Wow, they're in the ring.
- So cool.

668
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:27,972
- Wow, awesome.
- This is incredible.

669
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,173
Amazing.

670
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,009
This is so cool.

671
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,678
We weren't
in the same weight class at the same time,

672
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:37,348
but we boxed during the same era
and even did a training camp together.

673
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,285
A lot of people liked to debate
about who was stronger.

674
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,424
So this is gonna be a good opportunity
to settle it once and for all.

675
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:50,094
I never imagined I'd see them fight here.
You know?

676
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,463
<i>Attention.</i>

677
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,400
<i>At the sound of the buzzer,</i>
<i>begin the match.</i>

678
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:01,739
Box.

679
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:14,685
- This is insane.
- Amazing.

680
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:27,598
- Oh!
- Wow!

681
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:30,334
- Blocked it.
- Incredible.

682
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:43,815
- Great match.
- Got one!

683
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:46,818
He got one.

684
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,388
- Great.
- Oh, he got one!

685
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,684
Challenger.

686
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,887
- Amazing.
- I knew it'd be like this.

687
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,956
- Can't believe it.
- Great work!

688
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,290
Oh man.

689
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:28,392
<i>The winner is the challenger.</i>

690
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,328
I mean, we all knew this was coming.

691
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:31,562
I'm impressed.

692
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,731
This is exactly
what we thought would happen.

693
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,533
- A great match.
- Amazing.

694
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:40,304
<i>The first person to advance</i>
<i>to the final stage</i>

695
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,807
<i>is Hozumi Hasegawa.</i>

696
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:47,311
- That was great!
- What a match.

697
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:50,481
Of course, boxing is what I'm good at,

698
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:56,053
so the fact that it was an option
means I got a little lucky, I guess.

699
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,924
I made it this far
by trying to push myself

700
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,659
and my body to the limit.

701
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:05,329
So in the final round,
I want to push past my limits again

702
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:06,364
and win it all.

703
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:11,169
You all know, of course,
he's a former boxing world champion,

704
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:13,971
so I imagined this might be
the way the match ended.

705
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:16,607
He was the better fighter today.
That's all there is to it.

706
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:17,742
I appreciate you.

707
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,481
- Thank you.
- Good match.

708
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:24,382
Awesome!

709
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:27,118
- Good job.
- Great job.

710
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,186
Amazing.

711
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,590
<i>After the boxing challenge,</i>

712
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:35,059
<i>the first competitor in the finals</i>

713
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:37,728
<i>is Hozumi Hasegawa.</i>

714
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:43,301
<i>Therefore, in order for you to advance</i>
<i>to the final stage,</i>

715
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:46,304
<i>you must win Chase Tag.</i>

716
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,906
That's right.
I'm not allowed to box anymore.

717
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:54,478
<i>Katsuma Yonemura,</i>
<i>please proceed to the Chase Tag arena.</i>

718
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:58,015
I think that it's like an obstacle course,

719
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:01,185
and moving through something like that
is kinda my thing.

720
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:04,989
So I feel confident that this is
where I can shine, in a sense.

721
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,060
Oh, I can slide like this.

722
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:13,631
I'm pretty sure
Katsuma will be hard to catch.

723
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,399
<i>Attention.</i>

724
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:18,135
<i>At the sound of the buzzer,</i>
<i>begin the chase.</i>
