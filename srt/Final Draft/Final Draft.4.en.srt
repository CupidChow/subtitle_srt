1
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:13,446
<i>You chose the same player,</i>
<i>so you'll draw lots to decide.</i>

2
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:18,118
<i>Now, each captain,</i>
<i>take a ball from the drawing box.</i>

3
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:22,355
<i>Whoever draws the ball marked Final Draft</i>
<i>will win and draft their chosen player.</i>

4
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:47,947
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

5
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,164
<i>That moment was so frustrating.</i>

6
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,367
<i>I really think he's the type of athlete</i>
<i>who can come out on top,</i>

7
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:08,902
<i>no matter what the event is.</i>

8
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,171
<i>I mean, I was relieved.</i>

9
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:14,774
<i>In terms of overall balance for a team,</i>

10
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:18,011
<i>Kurihara was someone</i>
<i>I'd hoped to compete with from the start.</i>

11
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:23,616
<i>At this time,</i>
<i>the leader who lost his first choice</i>

12
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,351
<i>must make a new selection.</i>

13
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:32,158
<i>Yuya Shozui's</i>

14
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:35,061
<i>first-round selection is</i>

15
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,199
<i>Atsushi Arai.</i>

16
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,237
Let's do this.

17
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,610
<i>The reason I picked Atsushi first</i>
<i>is because as an athlete,</i>

18
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,780
<i>he has incredible ability</i>
<i>and insane potential.</i>

19
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,682
<i>So I didn't hesitate at all.</i>

20
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:57,283
I thought, "He's not picking Itoi?"

21
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,452
Even in the sauna, Shozui was saying

22
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,321
he wanted to be on the same team as him.

23
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,089
So I was honestly shocked.

24
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,025
<i>Round Two.</i>

25
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,761
<i>Yuya Shozui selects</i>

26
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,565
<i>Kazuhiro Goya.</i>

27
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,770
<i>Katsuma Yonemura selects…</i>

28
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,442
<i>Yoshio Itoi.</i>

29
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:26,679
I did not see that coming at all.

30
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:31,484
<i>I was kind of worried that he might try</i>
<i>to select all of the rugby players first.</i>

31
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,154
<i>So I tried to be proactive</i>
<i>and prevent that.</i>

32
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,188
Welcome.

33
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,624
All right!

34
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:40,693
I was pretty sure
one of us would pick him,

35
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,762
so I thought I should pick him early on.

36
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,366
To be honest,
I'd planned on selecting Itoi for my team.

37
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:49,135
I underestimated the strategy

38
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,204
that went into the order
of our selections.

39
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,173
I was pretty frustrated with myself.

40
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,409
<i>Round Three.</i>

41
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,811
<i>Yuya Shozui selects…</i>

42
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,349
<i>Koji Tokuda.</i>

43
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,452
<i>Katsuma Yonemura selects</i>

44
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,589
<i>Kenta Tsukamoto.</i>

45
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:13,993
Okay.

46
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:16,896
Thank you.

47
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,933
- Welcome.
- Let's do this.

48
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,303
Let's go crazy!

49
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,338
They've got a solid lineup.

50
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,173
No, we'll be fine.

51
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,741
- <i>Round Four.</i>
- We're good.

52
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:32,445
<i>Yuya Shozui selects Ryosuke Miyaguni.</i>

53
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:37,917
<i>Katsuma Yonemura selects Ryudai Onikura.</i>

54
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,652
I swear I won't let you down.

55
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,455
<i>And now Round Five.</i>

56
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,757
<i>I will announce the final two picks.</i>

57
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:50,129
<i>Anyone who is not selected</i>
<i>will be eliminated from the competition.</i>

58
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:56,936
<i>The final picks</i>

59
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,038
<i>for Round Five.</i>

60
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,174
<i>Yuya Shozui selects…</i>

61
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,785
<i>Hozumi Hasegawa.</i>

62

<i>Katsuma Yonemura selects…</i>

63
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,563
<i>Hozumi Hasegawa.</i>

64
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,209
<i>You chose the same player</i>
<i>and will draw lots to decide.</i>

65
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,585
I've got the worst luck.

66
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:50,256
- Thank you. Glad to be here.
- Glad you're on our team. Welcome.

67
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,793
<i>The leader who lost his first pick</i>

68
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,530
<i>will now choose his last teammate</i>
<i>from those remaining.</i>

69
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,441
<i>I didn't expect to struggle so much</i>
<i>with my last pick.</i>

70
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,710
<i>It was hard to write the name down.</i>

71
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,180
NAOTO HAYASAKA

72
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,450
<i>I've been thinking</i>
<i>I'd like to start my own gym for kids.</i>

73
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,520
<i>I wanna inspire kids</i>
<i>to train for the Olympics,</i>

74
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,255
<i>to achieve what I could not.</i>

75
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,792
Let's win it.

76
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,193
Yes, we definitely will.

77
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,162
Let's do everything we can to win.

78
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,064
FORMER STREET WORKOUT ATHLETE

79
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,466
After I retired, I tried a lot of things,

80
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,501
but I couldn't find a good fit.

81
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:38,638
I mean,
not many people even know about the sport,

82
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,674
so I'm hoping I can make an impact here

83
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,776
and maybe find a new path forward.

84
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,578
Careful, it's cold.

85
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,780
- That's crazy No way!
- Whoa, insane.

86
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,882
Cool.

87
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,752
- Antigravity.
- Incredible.

88
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:53,886
No way.

89
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:55,321
That's so awesome.

00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,990
MASAYUKI SHIMOKAWA

91
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,793
<i>I'm entering this competition</i>
<i>as a kabaddi athlete.</i>

92
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:05,398
<i>I want to beat other athletes</i>
<i>who come from more well-known sports.</i>

93
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:09,135
<i>I want the chance to show</i>
<i>how amazing kabaddi players can be.</i>

94
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,839
It has some elements
that are similar to sports like rugby.

95
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:17,043
- I can squat roughly 170 kilos.
- Seriously?

96
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,747
- I did not expect that.
- That's how strong kabaddi players are.

97
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:23,149
<i>And I'm committed to winning</i>
<i>for my family.</i>

98
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:27,153
<i>I don't want to exit </i>Final Draft
<i>this early. I wanna make it to the end.</i>

99
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,022
<i>I want them to see what I'm capable of.</i>

100
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,391
I'll do my best.

NAOTO HAYASAKA, 29
ELIMINATED

106
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,939
ELIMINATED

107
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:22,508
If it were up to me,

108
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:28,080
I would've wanted all 14 of us
to continue fighting together.

109
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:33,453
As fellow athletes
who gave everything to this competition,

110
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,855
I have deep respect for both of you.

111
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:36,923
The rest of us

112
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:41,060
will carry forth your spirits
and give it our all.

113
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,530
This is where we part ways.

114
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,166
If I win, I'll be calling you,

115
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,269
so we can all have some drinks together.

116
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:54,073
No matter who wins,
I promise that we'll all celebrate.

117
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,976
Thank you. Appreciate you both.

118
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,983
I mean, of course,
I'd say I'm pretty frustrated about this.

119
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,586
It's true that we're both eliminated,

120
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:11,057
but I also feel like we can leave
with our heads held high.

121
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:15,561
Being able to make it this far,
alongside elite athletes like yourselves,

122
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:16,829
has been such an honor.

123
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,899
Yeah. Please do your best
until the very end.

124
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,537
<i>The draft is complete.</i>

125
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,272
<i>The two teams will face off</i>

126

<i>in the next challenge of the competition.</i>

127
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,611
<i>Please make your way to the arena.</i>

128
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,317
Wow, coming back here makes me nervous.

129
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,952
- No doubt.
- Here we go.

130
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,688
- The tension, right?
- Everyone's getting tense.

131
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,290
<i>I feel reassured by them.</i>

132
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:19,892
<i>Everyone on my team has a lot of power,</i>

133
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,095
<i>but I'd say this team can handle</i>
<i>speed-based challenges as well.</i>

134
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,211
Wow.

135
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,647
Our team has the strongest competitors.

136
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:42,648
<i>For sure.</i>

137
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,183
<i>We're totally all about power.</i>

138
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,619
<i>We're super strong, yeah. Absolutely.</i>

139
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,354
<i>That's what we've anticipated.</i>

140
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:51,724
No matter what,
the next one's gonna be a power challenge.

141
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,693
That's some wishful thinking,
right, Kenta?

142
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,402
Here it comes.

143
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,505
<i>The next challenge is the Orange Stage.</i>

144
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:07,406
Orange?

145
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,875
<i>This stage will test your unity.</i>

146
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,143
Unity.

147
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,713
- Unity.
- Because we're in teams?

148
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,584
<i>Everyone, proceed to the stage.</i>

149
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:21,087
- It's time. Let's do it.
- Bring it on!

150
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,221
Let's go!

151
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:28,227
Oh!

152
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,196
- So that's what it is.
- Wow!

153
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,297
So this is it.

154
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,265
- Okay.
- Wow!

155
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:34,533
Let's do this.

156
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,404
- Looks good, looks good.
- I get it.

157
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,007
- This is awesome.
- What's happening?

158
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,844
- What the hell is this?
- This all looks really heavy.

159
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:48,347
- Jeez. Yeah, that looks heavy.
- What is this?!

160
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,883
When I saw two big piles of sandbags,

161
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,452
I thought, "Yes! Finally!"

162
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,288
"The time has arrived
to show how strong I am."

163
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,457
Yeah, I mean, that made me nervous.

164
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,359
I was like, "What's gonna happen?"

165
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,363
Whoa, crazy. They look heavy.

166
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,532
- What's that?
- We're stacking and climbing them?

167
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,267
<i>In the Orange Stage,</i>

168
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,237
<i>your unity will be put to the test by</i>

169
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,340
<i>stacking sandbags.</i>

170
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,242
Stacking sandbags?

171
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,944
- Oh, we're building a platform.
- No way!

172
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,580
- This is insane.
- This looks pretty crazy.

173
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:28,521
<i>You will carry sandbags,</i>
<i>each one weighing 45 pounds.</i>

174
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:34,293
<i>You must stack all of the sandbags</i>
<i>in order to climb to the top of the wall.</i>

175
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,696
This is a real game of strength, yeah?

176
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,364
So we have to build a staircase?

177
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,900
We gotta stack a lot of bags.

178
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,002
We'll need to stack them
to reach the highest level.

179
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,504
- Ugh, that looks so hard.
- That's pretty high.

180
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,909
<i>To finish the challenge,</i>
<i>each team will also need to carry</i>

181
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:54,613
<i>a 130-pound black sandbag</i>
<i>up to the highest level.</i>

182
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:58,918
<i>The first team to have all members</i>
<i>hit the buttons together wins.</i>

183
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:03,022
<i>And all six members</i>
<i>of the losing team will be eliminated.</i>

184
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,156
That's brutal!

185
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:08,527
<i>This is the perfect chance</i>
<i>to knock out a bunch of rivals at once.</i>

186
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:11,063
<i>Six people will be eliminated</i>
<i>in this challenge.</i>

187
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,231
<i>It's a huge deal.</i>

188
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,667
<i>I might actually pull this off.</i>

189
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:18,370
I thought my team stood a good chance
of winning this one.

190
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,408
<i>Each team selects two members</i>

191
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,276
<i>who will start the challenge.</i>

192
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,513
<i>After three minutes, two more will join.</i>

193
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:31,283
<i>Three minutes after that,</i>
<i>another two will join.</i>

194
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,220
Ah, so that's how it works.

195
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,489
The guys with more endurance
should go first.

196
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,327
<i>In addition</i>
<i>to your strengths as individual athletes,</i>

197
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:44,363
<i>you must demonstrate unity as a team</i>
<i>to succeed.</i>

198
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,502
I've always played individual sports.

199
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:53,239
Competing as a team
is something I haven't done

200
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:55,374
since I was a kid in middle school.

201
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,344
I'm not quite sure how it'll go.

202
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,982
The opposing team probably thinks
they've already won this one.

203
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:05,484
Overall, the guys on their team
have good mobility.

204
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,253
And the top-ranked guys,

205
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,955
Shozui, Goya, and Arai,

206
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,758
they almost certainly have an advantage.

207
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:17,129
Knowing what we're up against
and seeing the expressions on their faces,

208
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,031
I already know we can win.

209
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,567
I think it's better
if those two start first.

210
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,768
Okay.

211
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,371
Then we'll be lifting the sandbags
to the higher levels.

212
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,840
It's best to carry
as few bags as possible.

213
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,975
And then keep stacking them up there.

214
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,178
That's the best way to do it, yeah?

215
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,180
<i>I think that Koji and I</i>

216
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:37,883
<i>are probably the most strength-focused</i>
<i>members of the team,</i>

217
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,018
<i>so I'm confident.</i>

218
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,620
This is exactly what I was hoping for.

219
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,590
In football,
I was always in a position to offer

220
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,393
a strong foundation
and steady base of support.

221
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,728
This stage will showcase my abilities.

222
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:53,432
It's crucial not to let them fall.
We can't let them fall.

223
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,535
<i>All of our members come from team sports.</i>

224
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:00,439
<i>I think we're gonna be</i>
<i>pretty well-coordinated in that sense.</i>

225
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,576
<i>I believe that we can win this.</i>

226
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,345
So who should we pick
as the first two guys?

227
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,681
Whoever has good stamina
and can lift the most weight.

228
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:11,917
The first two members are going to have
the toughest job for sure.

229
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,753
They're out there the whole time.
Anyone concerned about their stamina

230
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,223
should definitely go last.
Save their turn for the end.

231
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,224
That's right.

232
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,460
Kurihara was the one
who ended up leading our team.

233
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,163
I imagine he's done
some strategizing before.

234
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,998
Kurihara's presence as a leader

235
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:31,403
has been a big help to everyone
on the team, myself included.

236
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,873
So the role of the first two people

237
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:37,910
is just to bring them all over
to the wall.

238
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,179
Then people who have fresh legs
can come in later,

239
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,348
and they can stack them up the walls
like that.

240
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,183
That'll be faster and more efficient.

241
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,019
It's all about figuring out
what your limit will be

242
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,287
for each challenge.

243
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,221
First of all,

244
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:52,157
we'll need a considerable amount
of sandbags,

245
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,792
and a good strategy.

246
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,962
<i>I was one of the first athletes picked</i>

247
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,131
<i>during the first round of the draft.</i>

248
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,402
So I believe my role here
is to ensure that our team wins.

249
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,404
I mean, we're at a huge disadvantage,

250
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:09,074
but ultimately,
the best athletes thrive in adversity.

251
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,912
<i>The next competition will begin shortly.</i>

252
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,280
Bring it on!

253
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,482
<i>Will the first two members of each team</i>

254
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,817
<i>take your positions at the starting line?</i>

255
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:29,762
<i>The Orange Stage</i>
<i>testing each team's unity will now begin.</i>

256
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,435
- Let's do this!
- Go!

257
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,003
Come on. Go, go, go.

258
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,216
Nice job, Shozui!

259
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,298
This is pretty tough.

260
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,040
TAKASHI KURIHARA, 37

261
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:18,143
FORMER JAPANESE
AMERICAN FOOTBALL TEAM MEMBER

262
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:29,121
KOJI TOKUDA, 36
FORMER AMERICAN FOOTBALL PLAYER/COMEDIAN

263
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,659
<i>I knew this was going to be tough.</i>

264
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,761
<i>Ultimately,</i>
<i>it was more about grip strength</i>

265
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,762
<i>than arm strength.</i>

266
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,098
<i>I was like, "How long is this gonna take?"</i>

267
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,533
Looks like
they're bringing them over for now.

268
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,570
<i>First, Oni and I will carry</i>
<i>as much as we can.</i>

269
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,038
<i>Not lining them up.</i>

270
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:49,274
<i>Because we'll waste time</i>
<i>if we don't have enough sandbags.</i>

271
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,356
<i>Our plan is to try and reach the goal</i>

272
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,191
<i>with the least number of bags.</i>

273
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,460
<i>I think that will be the difference maker.</i>

274
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:09,795
Up you go!

275
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,296
You got this!

276
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,432
I'll grab some more.

277
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,971
It's getting tough
to carry two at the same time.

278
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,040
No, no, just one at a time is fine.

279
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:24,343
<i>The first three minutes are almost over.</i>

280
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:27,746
- <i>The second pair is about to start.</i>
- All right, here we go.

281
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,849
- Let's go?
- This is gonna be a long battle.

282
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,557
- It's falling.
- Nice!

283
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,059
Go!

284
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,627
Keep going!

KAZUHIRO GOYA, 31 - FORMER JAPAN

I'm heading up.

287
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,678
<i>Goya's role is to stack</i>
<i>as many sandbags as possible</i>

288
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,380
<i>up onto the second level.</i>

289
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:04,249
<i>The others hadn't brought up any</i>
<i>to the first level yet,</i>

290
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,718
<i>so we thought</i>

00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,114
Go! Don't stop!

294
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,449
<i>The two athletes with the greatest stamina</i>

295
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:38,350
<i>are coming in now.</i>

296
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,787
<i>And their role</i>
<i>is actually the simplest of all.</i>

297
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,957
<i>They just keep carrying bags nonstop</i>
<i>and nothing else.</i>

298
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,992
<i>That's their only role.</i>

299
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,729
<i>I wanna be like a diligent worker ant,</i>

300
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,465
<i>carrying the sandbags</i>
<i>for as long as possible.</i>

301
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,067
Shozui.

302
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:56,935
- This one.
- Okay.

303
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,373
- Ready, lift.
- We got this.

304
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:14,987
<i>Team Shozui has reached</i>
<i>the first level with their black sandbag.</i>

305
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,225
Someone lift them
to the upper level! Lift them up!

306
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,861
- Go, Shozui!
- To the upper level!

307
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,403
- Stack the sandbags for now.
- Okay.

308
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,471
I'm going down.

309
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:51,356
Okay.

310
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,128
Seriously, this feels endless.

311
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,902
- Kuri, how's it going?
- We need one more person here.

312
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,871
- Let me take over.
- Next set.

313
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,640
I was like,
"Oh no, we're gonna lose at this rate."

314
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,943
So I wanted to be our final weapon.

315
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:15,214
I just wanted them to see
that I could be a game changer.

316
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,351
<i>You are nearing the six-minute mark.</i>

317
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:20,886
<i>The third pair is about to start.</i>

318
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,796
- I'm okay. Go, go, go, go, go!
- Yep.

319
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,531
- Try harder!
- Try harder!

320
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:35,000
Oni, I'm gonna lift this up real quick.

321
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:37,803
Can you pull the bag up
the rest of the way?

322
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,738
Okay.

323
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:44,543
<i>Team Yonemura has reached</i>
<i>the first level with their black sandbag.</i>

324

325
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,148
<i>The third wave will be our strongest guys.</i>

326
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:52,618
<i>It'll be Itoi and Kenta.</i>

327
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:55,587
<i>They're just gonna lift all the sandbags</i>
<i>stacked on the first floor</i>

328
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,290
<i>straight up to the next level.</i>
<i>That's the strategy.</i>

329
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:00,993
That's fast.

335

- Itoi, now!
- Kenta, one more push.

336

<i>I mean,</i>
<i>I just wanted to make use of the fact</i>

337

<i>that I was the tallest on the team.</i>

338
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:38,163
<i>So I just focused entirely</i>
<i>on lifting the sandbags up. Yeah.</i>

339
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,600
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Wow, great pace!

340
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,268
Yone, you're doing great. Nice!

341
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:48,707
We might not make it.

342
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:51,610
- Itoi's crushing it!
- That's insane!

343
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,016
Sorry, Shozui.

344
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:00,752
Okay.

345
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,356
Oh man. This one's heavy.

346
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:14,800
<i>This is football strategy.</i>

347
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,301
<i>It's all about roles.</i>

348
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:19,004
<i>You don't worry about anything</i>
<i>outside of your role.</i>

349
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:23,942
- Okay.
- Oni, get up there.

350
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,711
Yes. I'm going up.

351
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:33,118
HOZUMI HASEGAWA, 43
FORMER BOXING WORLD CHAMPION

352
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,855
<i>My role was just to carry</i>
<i>as many sandbags as possible.</i>

353
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:39,858
<i>It was exhausting, but I never stopped.</i>

354
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:45,731
<i>At one point,</i>
<i>they started to pick up the pace,</i>

355
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:47,032
<i>and I panicked.</i>

356
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,905
- No, no, no! Crap.
- This is really bad.

357
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,041
- We need one more up top?
- We need more.

358
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,343
- How we doing?
- No, bring more. Keep going.

359
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,979
- Okay. Thank you.
- I'll head up for now.

360
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,853
- We're good. We're good.
- Okay.

361
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:08,920
Keep it steady.

362
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:10,455
Coming up.

363
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:14,893
- You good?
- Wait a sec.

364
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,328
My back hurts.

365
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:18,196
Should I switch in?

366
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:20,966
You've been doing this the whole time.

367
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,234
But this part's easier.

368
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:25,604
Come here for a sec.

369
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,571
Hold it like this.

370
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:27,773
Ready, lift.

371
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,741
Okay. On three, yeah?

372
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:32,444
One, two, and three! Okay.

373
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,116
Ready, lift.

374
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,319
I'll give it one pull. You climb up there.

375
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:43,155
Here we go. Ready, lift.

376
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,023
Okay!

377
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,093
<i>Team Yonemura has reached level two</i>

Sorry.

384
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,375
Hang in there.

385
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,309
We can't lose.

386
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:06,812
This one's heavy.

387
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,047
Come on, come on.

388
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,382
Never give up.

389
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,384
Kenta.

390
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:16,521
All right!

391
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:17,923
Keep it up!

392
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,459
- Yone, Yone, Yone.
- Yes!

393
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:21,960
- Give him a hand.
- Got it!

394

<i>Shozui and I are different</i>
<i>in terms of physical build,</i>

395

396
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:31,236
<i>might have actually preferred</i>
<i>to be on Shozui's team.</i>

397
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:33,772
<i>That was sort of in the back of my mind.</i>

398
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,574
Hey, are we short on sandbags?

399
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,375
Sandbags? Yeah, we need more.

400
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:39,444
- Need one more person.
- I'm going!

401
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,248
Just like that. Keep going. I got it.

402
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,182
Okay.

403
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:49,321

00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:52,991

00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,827
<i>I'm completely confident</i>

407

00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:00,532
<i>I have to win.</i>
<i>Otherwise, it's meaningless.</i>

409
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,701
Final push, come on!

410
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,369
- We're good, right?
- Let's go!

411
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:08,573
<i>I feel the rush of blood</i>
<i>Going over my head</i>

412
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,242
I'll grab it from here.

413
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:11,910
Thank you.

414
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:17,415
Wait a second.
Should we just drag it for now?

415
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:20,485
<i>There's no more going back</i>
<i>And I'm…</i>

416
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:21,586

417
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,288
- Keep going!
- Not yet!

418
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,489
You've got this!

419
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:27,125
- Everyone, bring them over here.
- Okay!

420
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,427
Going up? Okay.

421
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:30,629
Time to go up!

422
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:33,398
- Almost there.
- Hold on.

423
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,035
- Just a second.
- Okay.

424
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:38,403
Ready, lift.

425
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,975

427
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:45,911
Get up here!

428
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:47,178
No, we got this!

429
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,981
- Come on, lift the black one.
- Now the black one.

430
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,417
Not yet. Still need a base.

431
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:57,856
We just have to climb. Everyone, jump up.

432
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,458
Come on, let's go, let's go!

433
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,362
- We just have to climb!
- Go, go! Let's go! Yes!

434
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:05,363
Come on!

435
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,771
Yes! Yes! Yes!

436
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:13,672
Hell yeah!

437
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,106
- Amazing!
- Easy!

438
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:16,174
This is crazy.

439
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,576
Yes!

440
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:18,643
Yeah!

441
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,211
Yeah!

442
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:21,346
Three, two, one!

443
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,581
Yeah!

444
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:24,950
We did it!

445
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,522
Bring it in everyone. You all crushed it.

446
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,560
Great work, everyone! Amazing!

447
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,963
Very nice!

448
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,000
No way.

449
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,903
- Great teamwork.
- Amazing work, everyone.

450
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,271
You never stopped.

451
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:49,774
You were incredible, Hasegawa.
Sai, amazing, you never let up.

452
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,109
Damn it.

453
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:56,114
I mean, it was the strategy.

454
00:26:57,382 --> 00:27:01,686
I mean, looking back, I think
maybe they had better communication.

455
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:06,157
I mean, they seemed to communicate
what they needed

456
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,226
better than us.

457
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:15,834
Even in my career,

458
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:18,169
I mean,

459
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,573
it's not like I won every time I competed.

460
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:26,344
So this was just another loss for me,
I guess.

461
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,684
Oh man.

462
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,630
<i>All members of Team Shozui</i>
<i>have been eliminated.</i>

463
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:49,100
<i>We'll now hear a few words</i>
<i>from each captain.</i>

464
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:52,637
Well, to put it bluntly, I'm frustrated.

465
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:57,308
Um, I had a lot of confidence
in this team,

466
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,511
and I went into it trusting we could win.

467
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:03,948
I think there are tough battles ahead
in this competition.

468
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,483
But keep fighting,

469
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:09,654
and don't give up. So thank you so much.

470
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:13,191
Everyone's… passion,

471
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:17,262
I've seen so much of it
throughout this competition.

472
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:21,733
And we're honored to bring
that same spirit, that fight,

473
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:25,470
to crown a champion that's undeniable.

474
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,538
Thank you.

475
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:39,617
Oh man.

476
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:41,352
This is so frustrating.

477
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:42,387
It's frustrating.

478
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,724
To know that this is all coming to an end…

479
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,292
It's kind of sad.

480
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,095

- Seriously?
- What does that mean?

484
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:09,481
What's that mean?

485
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:18,790
We lost a lot of competitors, didn't we?

00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:24,829
<i>No points were added.</i>
<i>Today's challenge was a team competition.</i>

- That's awesome.
- A victory celebration.

496

- Good for you, Kenta.
- It's my first time.

- Insane.
- The smell is nice too.

507

Damn, so good.

515
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,634
Seriously, it's amazing.

516
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,070
The best I've had here.

517
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:41,472
- Wow, so tender!
- Yeah, it's tender.

518
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:42,874
- Really tender.
- Delicious.

519
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:47,512
So good!

520
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:50,815
It was all strategy.

521
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,718
- Today's win, I mean.
- Definitely a strategy win.

522
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,086
Strategy was everything.

523
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,755
If there were nationals for that,
we'd do well.

524
00:30:57,822 --> 00:31:00,758
We'd go pretty far, yeah?
Makes you wanna face other teams.

525
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,761
<i>I mean, I feel like our team approach</i>

526
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:05,697
<i>worked out so well in the end.</i>

527
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:08,700
<i>I'd been talking with Hozumi</i>
<i>about it the whole time.</i>

528
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:11,302
<i>We both come from individual sports.</i>

529
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,005
<i>But supporting each other,</i>
<i>contributing as individuals,</i>

530
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:17,375
<i>and winning as a team,</i>
<i>that was just so satisfying.</i>

531
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:20,078
Hozumi tried to climb the wall
with the bag.

532
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:22,780
What an epic story.

533
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:25,316
It'll definitely be worth telling someday.

534
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,819
- So much fun.
- Really fun.

535
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:31,756
I mean, I'm just so grateful.
If I'd given up on that mountain,

536
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:34,359
I would have missed out
on that great experience.

537
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:35,994
You were the last one through?

538
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,528
- Yeah.
- Good for you.

539
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:41,165
I'm so glad I pushed through,
even with my nose running.

540
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:44,736
- Impressive.
- I used to play rugby for a long time.

541
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:47,472
And when I couldn't play anymore,
I switched to bodybuilding.

542
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,974
It was just something I found by chance.

543
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:55,013
But bodybuilding isn't a reliable way
to earn a living, long term at least.

544
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,282
When it comes to displaying your body,

545
00:31:57,348 --> 00:32:01,085
your physique usually tends to peak
when you're in your twenties.

546
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:05,123
Once that peak passes,
when you get into your thirties or beyond,

547
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:06,057
to be honest,

548
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:08,860
it feels like the next stage of your life
is pretty unclear.

549
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,396
You know, I think it's pretty tough
for all athletes

550
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,231
to transition into a second career.

551
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,734
And if you think too much
about what's next

552
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:18,303
during your active career,

553
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,138
you end up neglecting your sport.

554
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:23,574
- Kuri, you have a family too, right?
- Yes, yes.

555
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:27,845
You'll always have a family to be
concerned about, to support and protect.

556
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:30,982
Do you feel like that's a big part
of what you have to worry about?

557
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:34,218
It's a smaller league,
so even if you're playing professionally,

558
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:39,424
you can never earn the kind of money
that athletes earn in the bigger leagues.

559
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,793
The earning potential is limited.

560
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:44,329
No matter how successful you are,
there's a cap.

561
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,631
So, even as I was playing professionally,

562
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:50,401
I had to work a job on the side
in case I had to quit someday.

563
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,070
I had to survive.

564
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:55,773
And then I just kept training
and honing my skills as an athlete,

565
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,576
which ultimately led me to bobsledding.

566
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,079
I'd become a stronger athlete compared to

567
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:04,182
when I played football during college.

568
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:08,386
At that time, I was
in my late twenties to early thirties.

569
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:13,124
That's when I was actually
at my physical peak as an athlete.

570
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:16,694
If I had reached that peak
in my college years,

571
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:17,962
18 to 22,

572
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,999
I think my life would have been different,
and I regret that.

573
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:22,133
I thought, "You know,

574
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:25,470
I don't want young athletes
to have the same experience."

575
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:29,574
So, in order to produce
NFL-caliber Japanese players,

576
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,510
I thought I would provide
a higher level of training

577
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,979
to support the next generation
of players from Japan.

578
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:38,116
That's when I retired
from my active career.

579
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,618
And that's my story.

580
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,788
I went through my own version of that.

581
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,390
When I retired,

582
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,525
I had this strange feeling.

583
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:51,829
I wanted to change
and do something completely different.

584
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:55,566
So now I'm in my second year
at the company.

585
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,869
- Mm.
- Oh! That's amazing.

586
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:00,905
- I mean, my boss is younger than me.
- Wow.

587
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:02,840
In that environment,

588
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:04,609
well, there are

589
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:09,781
lots of moments
when I have to… bite my tongue.

590
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,616
But I have a family too.

591
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,153
You know, I've chosen that path in life,

592
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,756
so I wanna become truly independent
as soon as possible

593
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:20,758
to make life easier for them.

594
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,861
So come in for haircuts.

595
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:25,396
Wow, I wanna go.

596
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:28,800
- I promise I'll go at least once.
- I wanna go! I'm definitely going.

597
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:30,501
I'll go once for sure.

598
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:36,607
In terms of changes, Oni also entered
a totally different… line of work.

599
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:41,145
I mean, I imagine being an actor
is really different from being an athlete.

600
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,780
- That's true.
- Yeah, totally.

601
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:44,982
The reason I got into acting was because,

602
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,552
during my pro-boxing years,

603
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:51,556
I got cast in a boxing movie
that was being shot in China.

604
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,391
The opportunity

605
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,893
felt a little random, to be honest.

606
00:34:56,394 --> 00:35:00,264
I knew I wanted to be independent
and do something like Kuri is doing,

607
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:02,333
become a trainer or something like that.

608
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,303
I thought about
whether I should get certified

609
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:06,537
and look for work,

610
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:10,408
or challenge myself to do
something totally new with my life.

611
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,945
I thought about
what would make my life more interesting

612
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:15,646
and chose a new challenge.

613
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,084
Yeah. You know, I feel like
you've had more experience than me,

614
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:23,354
and listening to you talk about them
makes me think.

615
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:26,290
Right now, there's something I wanna do.

616
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,926
It's something I can make a living doing.

617
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:31,262
But at any point, it could end.

618
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:34,132
And if something comes up,
like it did for you guys,

619
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:35,600
and I wanna do something new,

620
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,169
I'm sure it might make me happy.

621
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:41,973
But the question is whether the new thing
would make me money.

622
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,575
That's a whole different story, you know?

623
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,546
Actually, I think it's rare
to find something you're passionate about.

624
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:50,581
It might sound strange to say it's hard,

625
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,484
but it's not easy
finding something you love to do.

626
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:54,919
- I agree with you
- I mean…

627
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,755
Like, if you just do something
you're good at,

628
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,625
it might eventually become
something you like to do.

629
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:03,461
- Ah. Like, over time?
- Yeah, over time.

630
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:06,063
I feel like that's one way
you could approach thinking about it.

631
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,331
I knew a boxer,

632
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:11,569
he was diagnosed with a brain injury,
and after that, he couldn't box anymore.

633
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:12,670
He had to retire.

634
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:15,640
And it all happened fast.
He didn't know what to do.

635
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:17,275
But a friend of his said

636
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:20,344
maybe he should try
running a rice ball shop,

637
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:23,247
just to give it a shot, you know,
and see if he likes it.

638
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:25,249
And after a while, he started to enjoy it.

639
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:26,150
And within a year,

640
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:30,121
he decided he wanted to make
his rice ball shop the best in Japan.

641
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,822
It became his passion.

642
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:35,526
So, you know, if you just start
with something you're good at,

643
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:39,297
it could turn into your passion,
and that would be really great.

644
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,098
Mm.

645
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:43,601
When I decided to come here and compete,

646
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:44,969
I honestly didn't expect

647
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,371
that this would end up
being so meaningful.

648
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,807
This is a deep conversation.

649
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,475
At first, I was just like,

650
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:55,279
"Of course I wanna win
that 30 million yen prize."

651
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,381
Not anymore?

652
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,417
- No, I mean--
- Yeah, he doesn't want it now.

653
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:00,618
I still want the 30 million.

654
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:04,622
I'm just saying that having
this conversation with you all

655
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:05,823
has been so great.

656
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:07,158
I mean…

657
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,627
Like, maybe today
added another layer for you.

658
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,662
- Yeah.
- Because today was about teamwork.

659
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,863
That's true.

660
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,433
Before today's challenge,
Itoi quietly said,

661
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:19,003
"You know, I think this experience
is gonna be worth way more

662
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,104
than just 30 million yen."

663
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:23,040
Yeah, it should be worth 60 million.

664
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,077
Yeah, double. Double.

665
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,612
Why 60 million though?

666
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:31,148
But seriously, though, when he said that,
that really hit home with me.

667
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,484
Getting to hear that kind of wisdom

668
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:37,121
and just being able to talk to you
as an equal,

669
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:40,258
I think that makes me
incredibly fortunate. Yeah.

670
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,893
Thank you so much, <i>Final Draft</i>!

671
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:47,064
- Way to wrap it up, Sai.
- Come on, Kenta.

672
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:48,933
To the sky! Throwing it to the stars!

673
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,768
We're not done yet, and we're still going.

674
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:53,704
- More to come.
- Thanks so much!

675
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,140
- Let's fight hard tomorrow!
- Thank you.

676
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:58,676
It's so cold again tonight.

677
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,044
Yeah, it's freezing.

678
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:03,814
- Tonight is especially cold, isn't it?
- Yeah, it's gotten colder.

679
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:05,983
- Freezing temps.
- Whoa.

680
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:08,085
- Well then.
- Good night.

681
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:12,857
I have to sleep in a tent again?

682
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:16,727
I mean,
I've only stayed in tents this whole time.

683
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,564
What?

684
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:22,833
What's this?

685
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:27,104
What's this? Creepy.

686
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:28,639
The hell is this?

687
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:29,674
Huh?

688
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:32,310
Wait a sec.

689
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:33,944
What?

690
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,847
What?

691
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,793
Whoa! No way!

692
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,529
Give me a break.

693
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,965
"You may withdraw from <i>Final Draft</i>

694
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:58,736
and drop out of the game
with a portion of the 30 million yen."

695
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,938
"You will leave with three million yen."

696
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,674
"If you wish,
tomorrow morning, when the bell rings,

697
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:06,377
please come to the entrance
of the campsite."

698
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:15,519
Three million yen…

699
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,322
Damn, this is awful!

700
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:23,794
Oh man, that's what this is all about.
I get it now.

701
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:27,765
<i>Faded lights, all the cheers have died</i>

702
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:29,367
<i>I look back </i>

703
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:31,802
<i>And now I dream another</i>

704
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:35,740
<i>Now I’m here, I’m not a shadow no more</i>

705
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:41,545
<i>Chasing echoes</i>
<i>Of a life I used to know</i>

706
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:47,017
<i>I feel the rush of blood</i>
<i>Going over my head</i>

707
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:51,188
<i>There’s no more going back</i>
<i>Ahead I’m led by fire</i>

708
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:56,494
<i>I feel my heart pumping</i>
<i>And I’m filled with dread</i>

709
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,831
<i>There’s no more going back</i>
<i>Ahead I’m led by fire</i>
