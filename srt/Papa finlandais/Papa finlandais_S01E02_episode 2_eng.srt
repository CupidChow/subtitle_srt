1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:10,520

2
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,530

3
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,080

4
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,090

5
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,320
 What is this?

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,360
 This is a Santa parfait.

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,920
 What's that?

8
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,450
 It's a perfect name for it, isn't it?

9
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,370
 Grandmother, you can be very eccentric sometimes.

10
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,210
 Why is it called a Santa parfait when it's not Christmas?

11
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,690
 She's not eccentric; she is creative because she was an actress.

12
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,960
 Wu Hyeon is correct.

13
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,630
 Correct.

14
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,200
 It's delicious.

15
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,540
 The seventh rule:

16
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,560
 even if you are alone, try to find friends to eat together.

17
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,120

18
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,240
I will have this one.

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,340
I will have a Santa parfait and coffee.

20
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,070
Okay.

21
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,400
Wait, did you say Santa parfait?

22
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,010
We have to make this parfait with the recipe that Papa made

23
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,570
because this is the signature menu of our cafe.

24
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,630
Is a Santa parfait a common menu?

25
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,550
Customers love it because it's only available here.

26
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,130
Why do you ask?

27
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,520
My grandmother made it for me sometimes.

28
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,610
Is that so? Is the recipe the same?

29
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,410
It looks similar.

30
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,100
Well, most of the menus can be similar.

31
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,720
The signature menu and stuff are all for the business.

32
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,850
The customer wants to cancel the parfait and order something else.

33
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,870
Is that okay?

34
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,290
I just finished making it.

35
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,990
What can I do? Why don't you try it?

36
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,700
We have to throw it out anyway.

37
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,370
Grandma...

38
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,660
 What is this?

39
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,910
 This is a Santa parfait.

40
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,180
 What's that?

41
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,010
 It's a perfect name for it, isn't it?

42
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,830
 You can be very eccentric sometimes.

43
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,410
 Why is it called a Santa parfait when it's not Christmas?

44
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,050
 She's not eccentric; she is creative because she was an actress.

45
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,800
 Wu Hyeon is correct.

46
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,860
 Correct.

47
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,110
 It's delicious.

48
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,440
 It's so delicious that it makes me sad.

49
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,480
 What?

50
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,400
 Right? Because it disappears when you eat it.

51
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,220
 Exactly.

52
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,540
 Even when I'm not around anymore, you guys should gather like now,

53
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,610
 eat together and live well.

54
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,570
 Grandma, why are you saying stuff like that again?

55
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,160
 Yu Ri will never eat alone.

56
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,090
It's tears.

57
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,510
Kaka, Toto! Yu Ri is about to cry.

58
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,830
We all live with such stories in our hearts

59
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,380
so we talk to each other and give each other comfort.

60
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,110
That's right.

61
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,260
Why don't you tell us about it?

62
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,230
It's a very personal story

63
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,340
so it's a bit awkward to suddenly tell you.

64
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,440
We have rules here.

65
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,180
We have to listen to the story of the person who's about to cry.

66
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:15,640
Because of those stupid rules, our work gets disturbed.

67
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,980
But it's all for the good of us.

68
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,710
It's all for the good, yes.

69
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,430
Okay, let's go ahead and start.

70
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,950
Toto! You have to be sincere.

71
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,990
Wait until she starts.

72
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,900
You are all doing this for the bonus, but why are you acting nice?

73
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,250
Shush! Don't worry about what he said.

74
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,410
Okay, why don't you tell us about your story?

75
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,770
Yes.

76
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,270
My grandmother passed away recently.

77
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,430
She had dementia.

78
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,580
She passed away in a car accident when I wasn't around.

79
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,950
I still have the food that she made in the fridge,

80
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:19,060
and the coffee beans that she used to drink are still left at home.

81
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,990
But I can't believe that she passed away.

82
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,200
As I expected, he's so fast.

83
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,150
I can't beat the speed of someone in their twenties.

84
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,190
Grandmother was like a mom to me.

85
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,690
My dad barely came home,

86
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:57,650
and my grandmother raised me since I was an infant.

87
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,370
What about your mom?

88
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,110
My mom...

89
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,310
I don't know who my mom is.

90
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,420
 Aigo.

91
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,280
 Oh, my...

92
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,880
 Aigo.

93
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,560
 Aigo.

94
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,890
 Aigo.

95
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,610
 An angel came to me.

96
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,520
 I'm sorry, Mom.

97
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,800
 Don't ask me who the mom of the baby is.

98
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,860
 You know what kind of women are around me.

99
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,950
 Look at her!

100
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,800
 She's making eye contact with me.

101
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,670
 Are you really not curious about anything?

102
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,260
 What's important at this point?

103
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,460
 It's good that you came to your grandmother.

104
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,150
 Her eyes are like mine!

105
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,160
 What? It's not.

106
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:30,970
 She does have the resemblance, and her mouth looks exactly like you.

107
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,590
 That's how I met my grandmother.

108
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:40,560
 I came to her on December 24, so she called me her Christmas gift.

109
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,780
 My grandmother only had me,

110
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:48,120
 but I said hurtful things to her.

111
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,060
 All right.

112
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,200
 Let's eat and cheer up.

113
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,310
 Here comes the curry!

114
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,470
 The one who said mean things to you

115
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:09,940
 must be eating well and living fine right now.

116
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:15,720
 If you are like now, it's your loss.

117
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,410
 That person never won in the first place! You don't know anything about it.

118
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,940
 You don't have to listen to what everybody says.

119
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,870
 You only need to say one thing to the people who gossip.

120
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,560
 Look straight into their eyes,

121
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,340
 and say, "So what?"

122
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,490
 If you raise your chin like this,

123
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,350
 you look proud and chic.

124
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,630
 What is that?

125
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:53,590
 It's not worth it to fret about useless things.

126
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,460
 Just do what you have to do now.

127
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,000
 That way, you can be happy.

128
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,120
 And what you have to do right now

129
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,390
 is enjoy this warm curry.

130
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,060
 Grandma.

131
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,560
 Please live a long life with me.

132
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:44,990
 Yes, I should live long.

133
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,290
Please don't make that face.

134
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:07,130
And after what happened to my dad,

135
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,730
my grandmother was very shocked

136
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,540
so she wasn't like her old self.

137
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:18,380

138
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,260
 Why is she not picking up her phone?

139
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,330
 Yes, Yu Ri.

140
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,140
 Grandma, where are you?

141
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,920
 - What? 
 - Did you forget about my graduation ceremony?

142
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,470
 Hello? Are you listening?

143
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,320
 Today?

144
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,680
 How could you forget about it?

145
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,930
 You were picking the shoes to wear to my graduation this morning!

146
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,330
 What's wrong with you?

147
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,250
 Grandma?

148
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,410
 Grandma? Are you there?

149
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:03,060
 Wait...

150
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,940
 Oh my, what should I do?

151
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,540
 I'm out of my mind.

152
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,340
 I must be crazy. What's wrong with me?

153
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,930
 Oh, my...

154
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,750
Let's stop it right here. It's good to do everything in moderation.

155
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,480

156
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:13,270

157
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,810
We'll get many bonuses, right?

158
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,580
I know you are happy about it, too!

159
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,750
 That day was a strange day.

160
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,060
 An ordinary father figure of a regular family.

161
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,560
  It was the view that my grandmother and I wished for so badly.

162
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,000
 What's going on?

163
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,560
 Am I a monkey in the cage?

164
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,030
 What are you looking at?

165
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,280
 Oh, don't be surprised.

166
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,260
 What are you waiting for? Dig in!

167
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:57,590
 This coffee is killing it!

168
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,390
 Is it good?

169
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,420
 It's good.

170
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,110
 How is it?

171
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,540
 It's delicious.

172
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,900
 Right? It's killing it.

173
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,000
 The weather is a killer too!

174
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,120
 Hurry and finish the food. Let's go outside.

175
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,930
 Let's go on a picnic!

176
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:42,920
 What?

177
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,240
 A picnic..?

178
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,700
 Yes! The weather's this nice, so it's a shame to sit inside.

179
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,910
 Let's take out the mat and pack some lunch.

180
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,970
 And put on some makeup, Mom.

181
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,020
 What are you waiting for? Hurry and move!

182
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:11,020
 But I have plans with my friend today.

183
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,480
 Plans?

184
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,100
 Which friend?

185
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:19,400
 Well... It's just my friend.

186
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,580
 Which friend?

187
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:27,100
 It must be Wu Hyeon. He's your only friend.

188
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,620
 You don't know that much about my friends.

189
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,840
 Wu Hyeon has been in and out of our place since he was a baby!

190
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,950
 Let's go all together.

191
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,820
 T-Together?

192
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,010
 Yes. We can all hang out together.

193
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,430
 Well...

194
00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:00,610
 The weather did everything for this year's picnic.

195
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,300
 Right, Yu Ri?

196
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,310
 Yes.

197
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,800
 "This year's picnic?"

198
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,010
 You're saying that as if we are always doing this.

199
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,870
 You could've just let it slide.

200
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,780
 All right, let's eat lunch!

201
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,450
 Wow, there are three different kinds of rice balls!

202
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,180
 Okay, cheers!

203
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,840
 It's killer!

204
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:57,730
 Hey, you should be grateful that you are not like your father.

205
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,520
 You don't even resemble his looks.

206
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,410
 And please don't take after your father's lousy personality, okay?

207
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,920
 Okay.

208
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,300
 - Wu Hyeon. 
 - Yes?

209
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,340
 Isn't my daughter, Yu Ri, pretty?

210
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,690
 Yes.

211
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:24,420
 You know, I only see her once or twice a year.

212
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,400
 So she's my daughter, but I don't know her that well.

213
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,230
 It means I'm a bad father.

214
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,780
 But you see her all the time, so you know well about her, right?

215
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,130
 Yes.

216
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:40,980
 It would be nice if someone who knows Yu Ri well is always by her side.

217
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,030
 That's what I thought.

218
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:55,120
 Unfamiliar happiness made me uneasy,

219
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,930
 and my anxious hunch was always right.

220
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,800
 Jae Hyeok...

221
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,080
 Come here...

222
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,280
 Jae Hyeok...

223
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,690
 Jae Hyeok...

224
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,430
 Jae Hyeok...

225
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,080
 Jae Hyeok...

226
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,170
 Yu Ri, you...

227
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,100
 I like that you don't cry often.

228
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:07,480
 Don't cry in the future as well.

229
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,370
 And please take care of this woman.

230
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:17,690
 This poor woman...

231
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,790
 My mom...

232
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,530
 Jae Hyeok...

233
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,550
Wow, that's intense. I don't know what to say.

234
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:58,710
Hey! It's not the place to say anything.

235
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,380
You went through a lot.

236
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,010
It would've been not easy for you to share that.

237
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:11,560
If you tell a story that's hard to tell, it's ten times the bonus.

238
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:15,320

239
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:21,350
I mean, you would have had a hard time.

240
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,950
Whether it's sad or angry,

241
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:37,240
there are things that you can't tell, even over time.

242
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,220
When my grandmother passed away,

243
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,900
I cried so much.

244
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,570
But in front of my dad's death,

245
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:50,570
I couldn't feel any feelings.

246
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:57,260
I guess I can say this feeling is sad in a way.

247
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,390
Still, he's my father.

248
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,770
I have to be sad.

249
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:25,540

250
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,240

251
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,880

252
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,920

253
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,710
♫  When the night is over,  ♫

254
00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:00,850
♫  As if the morning comes again,  ♫

255
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:05,420

256
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:10,490
♫  Since my love, you are next to me  ♫

257
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:15,910
♫  I'm not afraid of anything in this world  ♫

258
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:23,450
♫  I'm not afraid of anything in this world  ♫

259
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:33,460
