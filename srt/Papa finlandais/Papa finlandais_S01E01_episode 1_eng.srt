1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:11,920

2
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,510

3
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,200

4
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,100

5
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,670
Grandma. Dad.

6
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,090
You two are now reunited.

7
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,990

8
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,960

9
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,360
Are you happy to see your son again?

10
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,710
Grandma...

11
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,760
How should I live now?

12
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,600

13
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,090

14
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,740
I'm home.

15
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,760
 What are you doing?

16
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,300
 The curry is ready.

17
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,410
 Yu Ri?

18
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,460
Grandma?

19
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,980
 Come on out and eat!

20
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,040
 Don't skip any meals.

21
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,500
 I get it, I get it.

22
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,910
 You only ate rice and soups when I was away last time.

23
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,100
 I made a lot of other dishes for you.

24
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,310
 You are only going to Gyeongju.

25
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,790
 What about the aurora? When are you going to see that?

26
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,740
 You are not even flying internationally, why are you so worried about me?

27
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,570
 It's because you don't eat well by yourself.

28
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,230
 Enjoy your vacation.

29
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,180
 And stop worrying about your granddaughter's meals.

30
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,070
 Grandma! I want to have curry, too.

31
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,310
 Hey, Lee Yu Ri. Why did you take this down?

32
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,560
 First, you eat well, even by yourself.

33
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,100
 Second, always keep yourself clean, go to bed early, and wake up early, even by yourself.

34
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,990
 What's the third one? Read it out for yourself.

35
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,430
 Stop it. I memorized everything already.

36
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,840
 Then you tell me.

37
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,930
 Third, always do your homework, even if you are alone.

38
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,940
 And you didn't do your homework today.

39
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,040
 So how can your grandmother go on a trip without worries?

40
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,440
 You should've kept at least one rule well.

41
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,220
 You wrote this on your own when we were in elementary school. I never said I'd keep it.

42
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,570
 It's written in the picture diary that we promised each other to keep it.

43
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,890
 It's so childish! Why are you still talking about that old thing?

44
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:25,410
 Grandma. They are fighting again.

45
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,180
 I was sick. I couldn't do my homework because of it.

46
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,400
 Don't lie to me.

47
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,740
 It's not a lie! I did have a fever until just now.

48
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,510
 Fever? Let me see if you have a fever.

49
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,400
 Put your hands away. I did have a fever.

50
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,950
 Hurry and go home. Why do you always eat at my place?

51
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,630
 What are you doing?

52
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,730
 Seriously...

53
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,670
 Grandma, can I have some curry as well?

54
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,760
 Yu Ri, it's been hectic lately, so can you return to part-time work?

55
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,150
 We know your situation, but we can't wait for you indefinitely.

56
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,770
 We will hire a new person if you don't contact me anytime soon.

57
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,510

58
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,110

59
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,440
 The fourth rule.

60
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,360
 Try to achieve your dream, even if you are by yourself.

61
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,620
Ji Yong Joon.

62
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,380
Yu Ri.

63
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,460
Why did you come to the town when it's not a school vacation?

64
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,450
I'm about to go to the army.

65
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,890
I heard about your grandmother.

66
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,330
Right.

67
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:58,570
It's been about two weeks since she passed away.

68
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:04,470
If you had told me about it, I would've come to the funeral.

69
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,470
I'm sorry.

70
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,300
Why are you sorry?

71
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,300
It's because I haven't talked to any friends these days.

72
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,180
Will you be okay by yourself?

73
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,160
Yes. I will be all right.

74
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,150
I will get going first.

75
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:17,560
 Since my grandma passed away, I've been eating dinner alone for the past two weeks.

76
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,240
 I lied that I was fine being alone.

77
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:10,610
Your place didn't change at all.

78
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,030
Did you not take that down until now?

79
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,760

80
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,810
I got into the Seoul National University because I left it like that.

81
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:30,690
Your mother, who taped that up on your computer so you couldn't play a computer game,

82
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,560
and you, who didn't take that down,

83
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,950
both of you are amazing.

84
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,680
How can you underestimate me?

85
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,940
My secret game console.

86
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,020
Still, the son is ahead of his mother.

87
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,180
To go down memory lane,

88
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,820
shall we look at the yearbook?

89
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,700
I open it sometimes.

90
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,110
Whenever I think of Wu Hyeon, I do.

91
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,630
Baek Wu Hyeon...

92
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,630
 Okay, I'll take the photo.

93
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:03,170
 One, two, three!

94
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,200
 Aigoo, let's have some red bean soup.

95
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,940
 I was starving to death.

96
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,800
 Maybe there's a bum in your stomach. You are always hungry.

97
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,200
 Grandma, I think there are 100 bums in Wu Hyeon's stomach.

98
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,940
 100 bums? Do you want to see it?

99
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,130
 Stop it.

100
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,580
 - I'll show it to you. 
 - I don't want to see it.

101
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,920
 On the winter solstice, you shouldn't walk around outside at night.

102
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,430
 So eat up and go home early tonight.

103
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,000
 What about the winter solstice?

104
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,140
 It's the day with the longest night, so the ghosts go around on that night.

105
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,750
 What?

106
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,820
 Ghosts?

107
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:46,650
 Grandma, the thing Yong Jun is the most scared of is ghosts.

108
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:53,090
 Did you hear about the rumor about the public restroom in the playground?

109
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,940
 What rumor?

110
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,500
 There's a strange cry that comes out from there in the middle of the night.

111
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,970
 Gosh! Stop it!

112
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,610
 Red bean soup is a food that gets rid of those ghosts.

113
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,520
 So eat a lot.

114
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,510
 It's hot.

115
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,570
 Be careful.

116
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,590
 You are always like that whenever you eat hot food.

117
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,810
 I think you only use your brain when you are studying.

118
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,580
 Maybe.

119
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:36,170
 I do feel like my brain goes out of its house when I'm not studying.

120
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,000
 Brain runaway guy!

121
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,030
 How does that sound for Yong Jun's nickname?

122
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,830
 It's lame.

123
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:48,050
 Then you try it. Why are you picking a fight?

124
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,480
 I don't want to.

125
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,920
 You are so annoying!

126
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,770
 Hey, why are you two fighting over my nickname?

127
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,280
 Stop fighting again, guys.

128
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,730
 We are not fighting.

129
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,570
 Wu Hyeon...

130
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,260
 What is it?

131
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,650
 I want to go to the restroom...

132
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,590
 What? Do you want me to come with you?

133
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,720
 Yes.

134
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,090
 Go by yourself!

135
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,340
 No, you are coming with me.

136
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,730
 Hey! Stop pushing me!

137
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,900
 On the winter solstice, it's the day with the longest night,

138
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:35,150
 so many ghosts go around that night.

139
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,520
 It's me, Wu Hyeon.

140
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,010
 Seriously, Baek Wu Hyeon!

141
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,950
 I'm sorry. I didn't know you'd be this surprised.

142
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,650
 You freaked me out!

143
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,600
 I'm sorry.

144
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,400
 Hey, careful!

145
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,410
 Lee Yu Ri.

146
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,100
 Yes?

147
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,890
 Why are you not giving me a nickname?

148
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,210
 What?

149
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,580
 Why don't you give me a nickname like you did to Yong Jun?

150
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:15,890
 Do you think coming up with a nickname is that easy?

151
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:20,000
 Just name me anything like you did to Yong Jun.

152
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,210
 It's cold out. Let's go home.

153
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,790
 Guys, there's something in there!

154
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:39,380
 It was a time full of nothing useful.

155
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,900
 And that's why it was a more beautiful time.

156
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:49,840
Wu Hyeon must be doing great, right?

157
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,410
What is this?

158
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,680
Can I take a look?

159
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,310
What?

160
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:33,250

161
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,350
It's awesome.

162
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,880
Do you want it?

163
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,610
Can I take it?

164
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,030
Yes, you can take it.

165
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,560
Thank you.

166
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:56,130
Your grandmother must be looking at auroras every day in the heavens, right?

167
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,440

168
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:21,860

169
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,690
 What's this?

170
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,400
 Open it.

171
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,040
 I won't be around on Christmas this year.

172
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,050
 So?

173
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:50,130
 So I'm giving you your present early. The twenty-fourth is your birthday.

174
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,630
 You didn't have to give me an early present.

175
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:57,660
 You can miss a birthday once in a while.

176
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,950
 Don't catch a cold again because of your cold feet.

177
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,930
 It's very warm.

178
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,920
 Don't look at me.

179
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,070
 Guys, look at this! It's so cute!

180
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,410
 What is it?

181
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,660
 Merry Christmas!

182
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,510
 Those hats are for the children's story-telling time, so don't destroy them.

183
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,450
 - Yes. 
 - Why are you wearing it like this?

184
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,620
 - Why? 
 - Give me one, too.

185
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,120
 There's nothing for you.

186
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,080
 Give me one, too!

187
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,230
 Oh, really.

188
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,020
 - Hey! 
 - Oh, no!

189
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:59,900
 - Grandma, say something to him! He always hits me! 
 - Are you snitching that?

190
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,020
 - Why are you guys always fighting? 
 - This is how you wear this hat!

191
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,830
 - No, this is right. 
 - This is right.

192
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,000
 - I told you this is right. Let me fix it for you. 
 - Grandma, I wore it better, right?

193
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,460
 - Come here! 
 - Guys, stop it.

194
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,220

195
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,480
You have to eat dinner together...

196
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,570

197
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,900
- Are you not going to work? 
 - I'm working right now.

198
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,380
What kind of work is that?

199
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,410
Reading fortune for the store is part of my job.

200
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,950
Gosh!

201
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,140
Stop fighting each other! It's too noisy for me to sleep.

202
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,290
Seriously! Waiting tables is your job, Dad.

203
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:25,380
Do I have to wait tables while cooking as well?

204
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,650
I worked a lot during the afternoon.

205
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,000
So are you not going to wrap things up?

206
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,160
You must do a better job as a dad.

207
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,640
You don't have a sense of responsibility.

208
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,090
I just fell asleep for a second.

209
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:38,700
Do you have to bring up my sense of responsibility because I dozed off for a second?

210
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,920
Seriously, for f**k's sake...

211
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,500
What? Did you just curse at me?

212
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,080
I can't do this anymore.

213
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,570
Do whatever you want. We will share your paycheck, so it's good for us.

214
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,680
It's good for us.

215
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,590
It's super annoying!

216
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:04,170
I'm sorry to bother you in the middle of the conversation.

217
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,810
I saw the ad that you are hiring a part-timer.

218
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,770
Oh goodness, it's already dinner time.

219
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,620
Really?

220
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,140
Just screw it all up. It's crazy. This isn't right.

221
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,790
I heard everything, Toto! Are you going to keep saying that gibberish?

222
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:19,070
It's none of your business, Fortune-teller Lady.

223
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:23,230
What? Can't you be polite to your mom?

224
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,430
There's a saying that the household fails when the woman's voice is loud, so keep your voice down.

225
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,850
You are the biggest problem.

226
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:31,070
I'm sorry. I'll come at another time for the interview.

227
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,510
Where are you going? Have dinner with us before you go.

228
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:38,880
Yes. Toto might have a foul mouth, but his cooking skill is the best.

229
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,670
You have to try Toto's Omurice.

230
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,450
Bring the plate with you.

231
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:12,270
 Dinner is always together!

232
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:15,400
 Where are they shouting to?

233
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,540
Did you not eat for a few days?

234
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,940
Why do you say it like that? It's good that she's eating well.

235
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,790
That's Dad. Shitty hand skills, shitty manners, and a shitty mouth.

236
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:12,580
I guess it was so delicious that she got stunned.

237
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:16,140
I told you that our Toto's cooking skill is the best.

238
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,490
Stop giving out food!

239
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,250
You feed street cats so much, so there are too many kittens now.

240
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,310
What's wrong with that?

241
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,820
This area becomes the cats' litter box.

242
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,590
You have no heart.

243
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,590
Have some compassion as much as your cooking skills.

244
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:38,540
Why do I have to listen to this?

245
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:41,880
- Where are you going? 
 - If we ate dinner together, today's work is over.

246
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,020
What about the dishes?

247
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,260
We have a part-timer now.

248
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,740
Please go back to eating.

249
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:55,320
When do we do the interview?

250
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,780
We just did it.

251
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,870
We just did it.

252
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,130
Sorry?

253
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,300
Eating dinner together was the interview.

254
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,200
Didn't you know about it?

255
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:09,260
Maybe she's confused because we are so weird.

256
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:16,510
So what name will you be?

257
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,640
Excuse me?

258
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,840
Your name. What did you get it?

259
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,520
My name is Yu Ri.

260
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,470
Yu Ri? You received a pretty name.

261
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:33,690
Yes. My dad named me.

262
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,570
Papa's discriminating.

263
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,580
I think he didn't put enough time into our names.

264
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,220
I know.

265
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:44,680
Anyway, it's nice to meet you.

266
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:49,180
♫  When the night is over,  ♫

267
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:53,090
♫  As if the morning comes again,  ♫

268
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:57,890

269
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:02,930
♫  Since my love, you are next to me  ♫

270
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:08,490
♫  I'm not afraid of anything in this world  ♫

271
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:15,950
♫  I'm not afraid of anything in this world  ♫

272
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:25,620
