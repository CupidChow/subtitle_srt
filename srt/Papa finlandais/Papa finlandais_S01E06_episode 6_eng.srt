1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:10,050

2
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,480

3
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,150

4
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,080

5
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,960

6
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,480
Toto.

7
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,500
Hi.

8
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,300
What brings you here?

9
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,990
Well...

10
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,700
I brought the cat food for the stray cats.

11
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,250
What?

12
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:06,250
You didn't like Ma Ri taking care of the stray cats.

13
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,070
I did.

14
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,310
But when I thought the cats would be starving if the cafe was closed,

15
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,800
I got worried about them.

16
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,510

17
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,150
I knew you would be!

18
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,110
Good morning!

19
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,290
Oh, my!

20
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,930

21
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:41,020
When I thought I couldn't come here anymore when I woke up this morning, I got a bit sad.

22
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:52,770

23
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,830
Can you still not understand Wu Hyeon?

24
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,470
Don't you feel a bit sad for Wu Hyeon?

25
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,820
What about him?

26
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,630
You have people to miss, like your grandma and your dad.

27
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,260
But Wu Hyeon has nobody.

28
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,930
I know it's a bit weird to say this, but if he has one person to miss,

29
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,790
it'll be you.

30
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,030
He doesn't have a place to come back.

31
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,100

32
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,100
I hope this helps you to understand Wu Hyeon.

33
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,210
 I didn't open the cafe to lure you into it on purpose.

34
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,500
 And I didn't do it as a joke, of course.

35
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,510
 But if I opened a cafe like this,

36
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,620
 I might see you one day, I thought.

37
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,460
 After that day of incident,

38
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,140
 I couldn't go back to school anymore.

39
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,600
 I went to see you, but you didn't come out to see me.

40
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,830
 When I was getting drenched in the rain,

41
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,580
 your grandmother came up with an umbrella.

42
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,570
 Wu Hyeon.

43
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,420
 You...

44
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,740
 You should go see the aurora.

45
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,440
 That's my dream.

46
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:26,180
 When I'm exhausted and have lots of worries,

47
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,290
 I think of going to see the aurora.

48
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,850
 Whenever I think about that, it makes me regain my energy.

49
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:47,400
 From now on, don't think about anything related to your father.

50
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,300
 Just focus on going to see the aurora.

51
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,520
 Grandma...

52
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,420
 I'm handing down my dream to you.

53
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:15,220
 I'm giving you the biggest thing in the world.

54
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,990
 After graduating, I went on a long trip.

55
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:34,270
 I went to see the aurora your grandma wanted to see as the first thing.

56
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,980
 Since I inherited her dream,

57
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,180
 I had to make that dream come true.

58
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,220
 No, rather,

59
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:53,450
 I might have wandered around for a while since I had no idea where I should be.

60
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,900
 I never pitied you.

61
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:03,800
 Also, the thought that I could be forgiven for doing something for you

62
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,210
 was a reckless and rude idea.

63
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,580
 If what I did make you suffer,

64
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,890
 I'm truly sorry.

65
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,950
 I keep becoming a person...

66
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,850
 who is sorry to you.

67
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:19,620

68
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,840
Enjoy.

69
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,130
An order of seafood pasta.

70
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,030
 Since we gained energy from Finland Papa,

71
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,900
 we could've gone back to where we are supposed to be.

72
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:48,690
 Maybe finding the way back was a harder quest than finding the way away for us.

73
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,570

74
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,670
 Sometimes, courage becomes wisdom.

75
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,760
Is it good?

76
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,870
 - We are...  
 - Aren't you eating, Oppa?

77
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,700
 - now courageous.  
 - I'm eating.

78
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,250
You and I are the same.

79
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,640
Family is like that.

80
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,000
How is it?

81
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,160
It's very delicious.

82
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,090
 I'm also waiting for someone to come back.

83
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,180
It's hard to cut the cabbage thinly.

84
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,350
Wait, did you dry off the water well before putting that into the bowl?

85
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,470
That's right!

86
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,070
Okay, put this in the bowl. And what do I do next?

87
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,370
I said put a little bit of flour on that.

88
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,860
Right. That way, the ingredients stick together well, right?

89
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,410
And what do I put next?

90
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,530
Do I put some water in it?

91
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:26,090
Why do you keep looking for water? Water goes in for the frying batter.

92
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,040
Do you understand now?

93
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,360
Yes. And what do I do next from here?

94
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,900
So after this, you put an egg in it.

95
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,410
Okay.

96
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,690
- Should I crack this? 
 - Yes.

97
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,110
What are you doing here?

98
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,450
I was teaching him how to cook.

99
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,870
I had no time, so I called Toto for help.

100
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,290
Every day is precious to me.

101
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,880
I'm going to open a food truck, at least.

102
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,440
I will use this kitchen for now and tell Papa about it later.

103
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,170
Are you opening a food truck?

104
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,210
Why am I not included in this?

105
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,500
Ma Ri.

106
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,860
I feel left out.

107
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,960
It's minus fifty points for you.

108
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,320
Toto, what can I do?

109
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:18,180
Yu Ri, are you also going to help me?

110
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,600
Thank you.

111
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,280
We are really a family.

112
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,400
Don't cry. We didn't even start yet.

113
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,660
I'm not crying.

114
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,300
It's a happy tear.

115
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,960
The sugar and salt ratio is the egg sheet's most important thing.

116
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,060
Also, you have to grill it well to make the texture of the cabbage alive.

117
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,590
Okay.

118
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:49,820
Grill it.

119
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,260
Grill what?

120
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,430
Oh, let me do it.

121
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,790
I'll grill it well on my own.

122
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,180
But do we have to make this?

123
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,930
It'll be hard for you to do it if there are too many menus.

124
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,480
But I have to make the fried chicken without the bones.

125
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,090
Because my son loves it.

126
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,600
He's so stubborn.

127
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,080
Just teach him how to do it. He wants to make it.

128
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,050
Do it like this.

129
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,270
Got it?

130
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,450
It's so nice!

131
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,740
But how are we going to eat all this?

132
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,330
So I told one of my friends to come over.

133
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,870
He'll be here soon.

134
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,290
Who's coming?

135
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,920
Is her boyfriend coming?

136
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,840
Yu Ri!

137
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,420
You are here!

138
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,620
Hello, everyone.

139
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,680
Hello.

140
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,880
Welcome.

141
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,550
Please join us.

142
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,320
 Japchae is here.

143
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,120
 Why did you cook so much?

144
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,240
 Food tastes better when it's plenty.

145
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,240
 But still, how are we going to eat all this?

146
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,420
 That's why I'm here!

147
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,150
 It's cold outside. Hello, Grandma.

148
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,860
 Food also tastes better when you eat with a lot of people.

149
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:40,380
 Yu Ri, don't eat alone even when I'm not around anymore.

150
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,890
 You are saying that again.

151
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,360
 Don't worry about it, Grandma.

152
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,190
 Whenever Yu Ri's eating, I'll gather a lot of people.

153
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,110
 How are you going to do that?

154
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,270
 I come here to eat together because I don't want to eat alone.

155
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:57,540
 So I can ask everybody eating alone in the town to come and eat together.

156
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,290
 - Thank you for the food! 
 - Thank you for the food!

157
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,830
 I don't know where to start.

158
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,430
 I'm going to start from Japchae.

159
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,230
 Then I'll start from Japchae, too.

160
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,650
Is it the first snow of the year?

161
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,390
I think so.

162
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,020
Wu Hyeon must be doing well, right?

163
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,520
Shall we have desserts now?

164
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,150
Sounds good!

165
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,620
The best dessert in Finland Papa is...

166
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,420
Santa Parfait!

167
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,430
Yes?

168
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,610
What? Okay.

169
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,640
I'll be right there.

170
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,780
I'm sorry, but excuse me first.

171
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,140

172
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,160
The food's getting cold.

173
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,050
There are not that many customers.

174
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:40,700
We have to get some sales before Kaka comes. It's a problem.

175
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:20,080
She's a great dancer!

176
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,070
Awesome!

177
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,680

178
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,570
- She's such a great dancer! 
 - Right?

179
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,990

180
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,590
Wow!

181
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,600
She's a great dancer.

182
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:50,360
Wow, amazing!

183
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,110

184
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,910
Noona, you are beautiful!

185
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,730

186
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,280
I'll bring the doctor!

187
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,980
Yes, go for it.

188
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,070
Dad...

189
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,140

190
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,530
Enjoy.

191
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,760
Oh? Dad's here.

192
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,080
Dinner is always together!

193
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:21,420
See? My tarot reading was correct.

194
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,990
You are a psychic.

195
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:29,830
Maybe the earnest wish was heard.

196
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,660
You don't have to trust what I'm about to say.

197
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,710
But I went to the cafe almost every day to feed the cats.

198
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:42,590
And when I was there, I prayed for Kaka's son.

199
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,050
Really?

200
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,000
I just wanted to do so.

201
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,480
Like people praying in church, I just went to the cafe.

202
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:56,780
Finland Papa was a comforting place like that to me.

203
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:01,910
Mari, I love you so much!

204
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,700
Look at her! I guess Yu Ri's drunk.

205
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,930
I've never seen her acting like this before.

206
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:12,510
I didn't know Yu Ri could act all cutesy.

207
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,690
I've got nothing but being cute.

208
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,660
Stop it.

209
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,710
I'll get paid for my dancing next time.

210
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,490
Didn't you drink too much?

211
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,040
It's been a while to walk on this road.

212
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,780
I know.

213
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,380
Was it always this steep?

214
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,100

215
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:48,140
This is what happens in the end.

216
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,220
It's a bummer.

217
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,030
But the place is not the important thing.

218
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,420
We can see each other again.

219
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,880
You're right.

220
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,820
It's on me next time.

221
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,570
All right.

222
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,570
Let's go.

223
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,150
Let's go home.

224
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,670
Wu Hyeon.

225
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:48,510
Where are you?

226
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,320
Are you not going to show up forever?

227
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,310
You don't have to feel sorry anymore.

228
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,530
I mean...

229
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,450
Before that...

230
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:14,210
I think I made you a sorry person.

231
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:23,060
I'll always be waiting for you.

232
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,530
So please come back soon.

233
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,030
I'll be waiting for you.

234
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,020
Yu Ri.

235
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,960
Ji Yong Jun!

236
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,720
What's up with you?

237
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,600
Are you going somewhere?

238
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,760
In a few days,

239
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,560
I'm going into the army.

240
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,780
What? Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

241
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,340
It's fine. You don't have to do anything about it.

242
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,050
I'll be busy until I go to the military.

243
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,380
You don't look okay, though.

244
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,730
Are you sure you are okay?

245
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:23,840
Do I look like that?

246
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,100
I'll get going, then. Merry Christmas!

247
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,650
All right.

248
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,060
Today's the 24...

249
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,340
It's your birthday, but I don't think I can throw you a birthday party.

250
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,690
A birthday party? It's fine.

251
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,310
But it's Christmas Eve. Are you going to spend it alone?

252
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,260
You know what I'm saying.

253
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,940
I'm really going now.

254
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,590

255
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,380
Enjoy.

256
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,670
It's 32,000 won.

257
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,560
Do you need a receipt?

258
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,090
Get off work early tonight.

259
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,180
What? Is that okay?

260
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,200
Aren't you jealous of those people?

261
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,050

262
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,270
- But still... 
 - You can go home early.

263
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:39,780
There is no fool like caring for others and not caring for yourself.

264
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,770
On days like today, you have to treat yourself well.

265
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,790

266
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:16,560

267
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:32,710

268
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,830
Yu Ri.

269
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,680
I'm sorry.

270
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,690
I feel like I made you confused.

271
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:58,050
So I couldn't show up...

272
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:01,700
in front of you easily.

273
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,730
It's not our fault.

274
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:17,720
You can put that burden down now.

275
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,680
No, maybe...

276
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,490
I might have given you the hardest burden.

277
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:36,530
I made you a sorry person.

278
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,220
On that rainy day,

279
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:46,130
if I didn't leave you out there alone...

280
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,280
We...

281
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,780
We might not have been like this.

282
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:07,550
I have lost you.

283
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:13,120

Merry Christmas!

290
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,790
Dong Wuk!

291
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:50,770

292
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,940
I missed you.

293
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,330
I missed you a lot.

294
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,790
 When can Grandma go see the aurora?

295
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:03,130
 Please stay healthy, Grandma. I'll take you to see the aurora one day.

296
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:07,660
 We don't have to go anywhere. I'm seeing the aurora right now.

297
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,740
 - Where? 
 - Where?

298
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,680
 Where the star is shining over there,

299
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,540
 can't you see it?

300
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,770
 Am I the only one who can't see it?

301
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,650
 Grandma, please don't tease us.

302
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:23,620
 I'm not lying. There are purple and green auroras dancing.

303
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,890
 Can't you see that?

304
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,670
 What's going on?

305
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:38,400
 What are you guys doing without me?

306
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,480
 Wow.

307
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,760
 Wow, incredible.

308
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:11,200
♫  When the night is over,  ♫

309
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,990
♫  As if the morning comes again,  ♫

310
