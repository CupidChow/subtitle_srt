1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:08,340

2
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,430

3
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,090

4
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:32,100

5
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,880
I'm home.

6
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,840
 Lee Yu Ri! Hurry.

7
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,470
 It's heavy. Let me carry it for you.

8
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,400
 I'll hang those later.

9
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,350
 Why don't you two rest now?

10
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,190
 No, we can finish it. Please stay inside, Grandma.

11
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,800
 Let's go.

12
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,270
 It's not easy to wash blankets for me anymore.

13
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,340
 Grandma, the laundromats do it for you these days! You don't have to do it anymore.

14
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,780
 Those all cost money!

15
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,690
 You can just call me for help.

16
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,500
 I can carry heavy things, too.

17
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,430
 I'm not ready to let my grandmother go yet.

18
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,910
 My goodness!

19
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,890
 Oh, seriously!

20
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,420
Hey, it's leaking all over the floor!

21
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,620
You forgot your brain. Do you even use it, you idiot?

22
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,470
"Stupid, Idiot." You used the forbidden words.

23
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,730
That's another salary cut.

24
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,670
So what now?

25
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,340
Papa will know how annoying you are when he sees you

26
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,010
so no points will be deducted from me!

27
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,130
This is a situation where anybody would be annoyed.

28
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,810
Well, get lost.

29
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,860
What? What did you just say now?

30
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,190
Did I say something?

31
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,420
You just said "Get lost" to me.

32
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,980
When? When did I say that?

33
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,100
I heard everything! You said "Get lost" to me.

34
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,140
I didn't say that.

35
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,590
You did say "Get lost" to me!

36
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,470
Kaka! Why are you so extra sensitive today?

37
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,360
And also, Toto, stop it. It's your fault.

38
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,860
Right?

39
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,940
How can you take Kaka's side when you didn't see anything?

40
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,320
Did you hear me saying, "Get lost?"

41
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,730
Toto, I told you to stop it.

42
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,610
I heard what you said, and you say that often.

43
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,940
That's right.

44
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,270
Why are you always only like this to me?

45
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,670
I just can't have a conversation with you guys.

46
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,870
I can't let this slide, Toto.

47
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,660
- Kaka, no violence. It's minus 100 points, so stop it. 
 - Don't stop me!

48
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,630
Let's just split up, okay?

49
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,260
Let's give it all up!

50
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,160
Okay! Talking about splitting up is minus 10 points.

51
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,900
Seriously, you are such an old stuck-up! I wish I could hit you.

52
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,800
What? An old stuck-up?

53
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,670
Come at me!

54
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,760
I want to see the faces of your parents.

55
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,440
Do you have a right to talk about my parents?

56
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,540
Don't you think my parents will still be better than you?

57
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,910
What did you say?

58
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,130
- Let go of this. 
 - How dare you!

59
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,420
What do you know about me?

60
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,630
Please, guys! It's minus 300 points!

61
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,930
Please don't fight, everyone!

62
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,720
Let go of my hair.

63
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,780
 Sometimes, family can be ruder than strangers,

64
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,000
 and they can force you to understand one-sidedly.

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,150
 Becoming a good family

66
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:05,440
 may take more practice than anything else in the world.

67
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,980
Wait, I'm getting a call.

68
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,050
My phone is ringing!

69
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,790
No, I'm not coming.

70
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,780
What? Try to find me, you punk.

71
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,250
Why should I pay for that?

72
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,110
Are you crazy?

73
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,820
Don't ever call me again, you bastard!

74
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:42,490
 Dinner is always together!

75
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,790
I rarely say this, but this is really delicious.

76
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,070
You have great cooking skills.

77
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,810
It's just a regular curry.

78
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,480
I'm sick of that.

79
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,310
My son, shall we do cheers?

80
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:25,590
To find myself, I dropped everything and left for Hawaii one day.

81
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,020
You mean you dumped your family.

82
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:32,130
I didn't dump my family but escaped from the suffocating household.

83
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,920
It's called avoiding responsibility.

84
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,730
Be quiet.

85
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:42,400
A cold husband and an indifferent child, it's all useless.

86
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,740
I learned the Hula dance while I was there.

87
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,360
The dance and music consoled me.

88
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,150
Still, I'm better than someone who got into gambling.

89
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,770
I got out of it now.

90
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:00,650
What's the point? The family became a total mess.

91
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:05,600
I'm the most pitiful one here for being abandoned by my parents.

92
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,060
I grew up like an orphan staying around relatives' houses.

93
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,890
But still, I grew up fine.

94
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,160
Do you think you grew up fine?

95
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,380
I guess you don't know you have so many issues in your personality.

96
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,380
You're a total nutcase.

97
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,820
Gosh, seriously...

98
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,540
Stop it. Your words are too harsh, Kaka.

99
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,400
You've got minus 10 points.

100
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:37,930
But the scattered family got back together and opened this cafe.

101
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:43,580
You know you don't get along with each other, but you still gather because you are a family.

102
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,610
What? A family?

103
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,400
Did you think we were a real family?

104
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,500
Where did you get that from?

105
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,410
We are a fake family pretending to be a family.

106
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,600
Did you not know about this before coming here?

107
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,710
Didn't you get a resume review by email before you came here?

108
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,190
No, I didn't do anything like that.

109
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,940
I just happened to learn about this place and came by.

110
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,210
Then what about your name?

111
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,280
My name?

112
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,840
When we asked what name you received, you said it was Yu Ri.

113
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:28,380
It's really the name my dad gave me.

114
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:33,990
That's strange. The email from Papa said that a part-timer would come.

115
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,360
So I thought you passed the resume and interview.

116
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,070
Who's Papa?

117
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:46,070
The owner of this cafe, "Finland Papa."

118
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:57,050
It means that Papa knew about her.

119
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,180
It's a mystery.

120
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,330
Then why don't we call the Papa person?

121
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,920
Well...

122
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,930
That won't be possible.

123
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:15,060
Work instructions and communication are only through text and email.

124
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,450
He never showed his face to us.

125
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,920
But Papa's eyes are everywhere.

126
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,280
That's Papa's eyes.

127
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:30,100
Through those surveillance cameras, he watches us work.

128
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,790
If you do well, there's a bonus.

129
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,690
If you don't follow the rules, you get a deduction from your salary.

130
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,180
That's right.

131
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:45,280
And giving a name is for living a new life by having a new name.

132
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,630
But I think it's just to make it easier to call each other.

133
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,960
We are also curious about who Papa is.

134
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,950
We don't know why the business is running in this way.

135
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,580
I'm sure he's an excellent businessman

136
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:05,860
with a strategy to promote the cafe with this unique concept.

137
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,040
I can bear every other thing.

138
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,490
But the "Ten Rules for Family Harmony."

139
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,640
I hate that.

140
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,400
I really hate that.

141
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,390

142
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,880
The first rule is that

143
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,980
dinner is always together.

144
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:33,870
That's why you are all eating together, no matter how much you fight with each other.

145
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,640
Right.

146
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,570
What happens if you don't follow the rules?

147
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,970
You get a cut from your salary as much as your penalty.

148
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,360
And there's a big bonus if you follow the rules well.

149
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,150
Bingo!

150
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:50,910
And all of this is monitored by that surveillance camera.

151
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,580
That's right.

152
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:57,530
When someone in your family sheds tears, you stay with them or listen to their stories.

153
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,790
Those are the number two and three of the rules.

154
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,920

155
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,030

156
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:15,890
Then did you listen to my grandma story because of these rules?

157
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,800
Yes.

158
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:21,960
Why would we listen to others' stories when we are busy?

159
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,110
Toto, that's too harsh.

160
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,670
But Yu Ri's story was very moving.

161
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,210
I didn't know that.

162
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,470
I'm sorry.

163
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:38,560
No, don't be sorry. Thanks to you, we all got benefits.

164
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:48,480
I'll listen to your story again if you need me.

165
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,570
Of course, I get the bonus as well.

166
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,310
But really, because of all the bonus points,

167
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,190
this month's paycheck will be quite thick.

168
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,220
Kaka!

169
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,300
 A strange family,

170
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:13,050
 but I like the first rule that dinners are always together the most.

171
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,960
 Also, that's my reason for coming to this cafe to work.

172
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,800
 You are doing it again.

173
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,530
 If you don't cut it off, I won't make noodles for you guys.

174
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,670
 Read this while I make noodles.

175
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,330

176
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,110

177
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,880
 What's the reason? Why are you angry?

178
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,020
 When was I angry? I'm not.

179
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,990
 Then why did you get sulky and go home first?

180
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,360
 I heard that the boys would all go on a group blind date.

181
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,610
 And I thought you would go with them, so I came home first.

182
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,270
 What?

183
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:03,470
 Are you angry because of that?

184
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,880
 I said I was never angry.

185
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,600
 You said you wouldn't go out on a blind date because it was boring, but I guess you changed your mind.

186
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,310
 You didn't want me to go on a blind date, did you?

187
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,940
 Of course–

188
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:24,600
 What are you saying? You going out on a blind date is none of my business.

189
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,700
 Stop looking at me.

190
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,650
 What did I do?

191
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,960
 Are you laughing at me? Do you think I'm easy?

192
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,040
 No.

193
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,250
 Why are you laughing at me, too, Grandma?

194
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,600
 Stay still for a second.

195
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,450
 Lee Yu Ri.

196
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,330
 I won't go out on a blind date.

197
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,570
 I won't do anything that you don't like.

198
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,060
Hello, Papa.

199
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,090
I mean, Boss.

200
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:55,810
 Are you not going to show up like this?

201
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:59,890
 Do you happen to know me?

202
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:04,580
 I guess that's why you accepted me as a part-timer, right?

203
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:08,390
I really want to meet you in person.

204
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,780
I hope you'll show your face someday.

205
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:27,420
Last time, you hid it in the onion box, and now you are hiding it in the potato box.

206
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,630
Why not hide it in the fridge?

207
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,680
Shall I?

208
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,660
Yes, that sounds good.

209
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,790
No, no. The fridge is too easy to find.

210
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,230
What's so different about the inside of the fridge and the vegetable boxes?

211
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,600
Those guys will find out where I am, no matter what!

212
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,070
I can't let them find this.

213
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:48,580
So bring that to your son! You worked hard for that money.

214
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,430
He's a credit defaulter, so he can't put money in a bank.

215
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,740
If so, the money would get seized immediately.

216
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,840
That's why he's hiding all of his money in cash bundles.

217
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,780
Bring that to your son right now.

218
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,210
I don't have the courage to see my son.

219
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,560
Mister.

220
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,920
You don't have to hold back.

221
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,110
Your son must be missing you a lot.

222
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:22,090
I did nothing for him.

223
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,990
Will he still want to see me?

224
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,510
What you just said now,

225
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:33,970
if I heard that from my dad, I think I would be very sad.

226
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,920
You told me before that

227
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,220
when the feeling of sorry piles up, you run away.

228
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:47,120
 By the way, if the feeling of sorry piles up, then it becomes a debt.

229
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:52,660
 Like people running away from loan sharks,

230
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:58,180
 if the limit of feeling sorry for someone exceeds, you feel like you can't pay back for the rest of your life,

231
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,210
 so you avoid that person.

232
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,130
I think my dad was like that.

233
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:07,200
But do you know that made me feel even sadder?

234
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,900
It's because I also became a sorry person for my dad.

235
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,150

236
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:34,100
 It's braver to go out to be forgiven than forgiving.

237
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,590
 What are you doing here now?

238
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,910
 What do you want to do?

239
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:00,310
 I didn't know he was in that state.

240
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,960
 If I had known about it a bit earlier—

241
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,870
 If you knew about it, then what?

242
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,860
 What can you do for him?

243
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,530
 I would've never contacted you, but Dong Wuk wanted it.

244
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,810
 I guess you are still his dad.

245
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,520
 He was looking for someone like you.

246
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,500
 Here.

247
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,480
 What's this?

248
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,570
 Use it for Dong Wuk's hospital bill.

249
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,420
 Did you gamble again?

250
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,210
 No! I washed my hands of gambling.

251
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,980
 I worked and earned this.

252
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,100
 Are you saying you are working?

253
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,910
 Yes.

254
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:52,420
 I go to work every day and save my salary every month.

255
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,350
 This is driving me crazy...

256
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,450
 You should've lived like this a long time ago.

257
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,520
 Mom?

258
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,970
 Dong Wuk.

259
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,560
 Dad.

260
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,860
 Dong Wuk.

261
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:51,700
Getting a present from Santa on Christmas was my son's wish.

262
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,520
But I never made that wish come true.

263
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,520
He said he's not getting a gift because he's not a good kid.

264
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,440
That's what he told me when he was six.

265
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,690
That little boy told me...

266
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,900
that he would be a better son.

267
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:25,150
You missed many opportunities to become a Santa for your son.

268
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:30,950
Bring him a present. Become a Santa and give him a present.

269
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,660
How?

270
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:39,510
The time that's left for my son... is about two months now.

271
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,860
Will he be able to...

272
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,460
hold out until December?

273
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,100
One second.

274
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,930
All three are lucky Major cards.

275
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,600
It says the Archangel Gabriel will give us good news.

276
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,180
Wheel of Fortune.

277
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,940
Kaka.

278
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:34,430
It's not your son, but it's your work to wait.

279
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:39,130
Not just waiting, but waiting with the hopes up.

280
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:48,090
Did you pay off a little bit of your debt of feeling sorry?

281
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,900
I...

282
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,860
I feel like I didn't pay off anything.

283
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:00,240
 You grew up as a man while I was away.

284
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,700
 You'll grow a beard soon.

285
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,800
 If I'm like you,

286
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,670
 I can also grow a big beard.

287
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:18,930
 It's because even by the evening,

288
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,700
 you'd have stubble on your chin.

289
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:55,730
 With this, please don't feel sorry from now on.

290
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,500
 Next time, confidently visit me, Dad.

291
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,140
 Just with that one hug,

292
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,570
he told me that I paid back all my debt to him.

293
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,410
That little boy...

294
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:15,620
How can he forgive my debt like that?

295
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,670
He's not good with numbers.

296
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,220
With such a sweet heart,

297
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,920
how is he going to live in this harsh world?

298
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:35,600
Your son is probably very happy now.

299
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:42,800
Actually, I never had a chance to hug my dad.

300
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,660
 How can you go without even eating one meal?

301
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,190
 Then why did you come here?

302
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,450
 It's to report that I'm alive.

303
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,710
 I am letting you know that I'm alive.

304
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,700
 Dad.

305
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,500
 Well...

306
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,340
 When will you visit us again?

307
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,190
 I have no idea. I'm heading out!

308
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,710
 He visited us once or twice a year.

309
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:32,050
 And whenever I saw him, I said at his back, "Dad, hug me once before you go."

310
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,760
 I only said that in my head.

311
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,370
I'm home.

312
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:18,300
 Papa, who are you?

313
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,480
Do I look like someone who has that much guts?

314
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,400
Is it really not you?

315
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,930
I said it's not me.

316
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,830
Then who is it?

317
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:35,130
It's definitely someone who knows me well.

318
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:38,680
It keeps bothering me.

319
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,330
I don't know who Papa is.

320
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,190
But I think it was a good idea you went to work there.

321
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:48,430
You look healthy now, chatty and bright.

322
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,500
You look like your old self.

323
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,850
I think you should be thankful to that person.

324
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,250
Seriously, who is it?

325
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,160
♫  When the night is over,  ♫

326
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:11,570
♫  As if the morning comes again,  ♫

327
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:16,280

328
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:20,940
