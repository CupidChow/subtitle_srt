1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:10,070

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,170

3
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,990

4
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,040

5
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,520

6
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,160
 He's a senior from my cooking academy.

7
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,340
 And he chased me after for some time.

8
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,080
What brings you to come to my restaurant?

9
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,640
I want to open my own restaurant like you one day

10
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,820
so I wanted to see how you run it.

11
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,140
Did I come when you are busy?

12
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,320
No, I'm glad you are here.

13
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,360
This is a new menu I made. Can you try and assess it for me?

14
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,910
It's abalone.

15
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,850
Oppa, do you happen to like Finland?

16
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,440
Finland?

17
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,930
Why would I like Finland when I'm an Italian chef?

18
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,760
Right.

19
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,940

20
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,230
I can take these down.

21
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,700

22
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,260

23
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,770
Good morning.

24
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,990
Good morning! Here you go.

25
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,450
Good morning, Bong Gu! Here's your morning coffee.

26
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,650
Thank you.

27
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,970
Good morning.

28
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,940
Yes, here you go.

29
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,700
There's one more box today.

30
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,790
Thanks to you guys, I'll be rich soon.

31
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,040
By the way, Yu Ri.

32
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,130
Do you know which country consumes the most coffee compared to the population?

33
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,700
America?

34
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,690
No, it's Finland!

35
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,370
Oh, really?

36
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,970
Yes. It's cold over there, so people drink coffee a lot.

37
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,870
You know, there's a Finland-style coffee as well.

38
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,910
And also, they consume a lot of sweet cakes with it.

39
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,250
Did you ever go to Finland by any chance?

40
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,500
Of course, I did!

41
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,590
I've been to Finland and Norway.

42
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,120
I love Northern European countries, so I've been there multiple times.

43
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,210

44
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,490
What? Bong Gu?

45
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,230
No, Kim Bong Gu's not the one.

46
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,450
But he said he's been to Finland.

47
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,270
Finland?

48
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,750
Maybe he meant a sauna named Finland.

49
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,940
Bong Gu bluffs a lot.

50
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,180
I heard that Kaka met him at a gambling place.

51
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,430
So he must have lied to you to look like he knows stuff about it.

52
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,430
He's a total player.

53
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,380
Is that so?

54
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,960
How can I help you?

55
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,370
We are not open yet.

56
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,880
Seung Yun.

57
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,770
What is he doing? Hey, stop it!

58
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,240
What are you doing right now?

59
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,080
Hey! What's wrong with you?

60
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,710
Let go of this!

61
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,290
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

62
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,600
How dare you come here?

63
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,350
Seung Yun.

64
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,970
Hey!

65
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,780
I'm sorry we showed up out of the blue.

66
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,930
I called you so many times, but you never picked up, so we decided to come here.

67
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,770
Of course, I didn't pick up because I blocked your number.

68
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,420
We went to pick you up when things got a little better.

69
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,950
But you didn't want to see us at all.

70
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,070
So your mom cried a lot.

71
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,510
We wanted to take you back, no matter what.

72
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,300
But you were feeling lost and dropped out of school at the time.

73
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:54,220
So everyone said it would make things worse if we suddenly appeared in front of you.

74
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,740
We were waiting for the right time.

75
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,290
But that made things too late.

76
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,360
I'm sorry, Seung Yun.

77
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,580
It's been a while to hear my real name.

78
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,170
What's your name, child?

79
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,760
Her name's Hae Yun. Lee Hae Yun.

80
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,480
He's your brother. Say hello to him.

81
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,170
Brother, my foot.

82
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,200
Lucky you.

83
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,890
You have a mom and dad.

84
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,770
Seung Yun.

85
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,700
Let's live together from now on.

86
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,210
It's not too late.

87
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,090
If I join you, your peace will be broken.

88
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,100
Will that be okay with you?

89
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,620
This combination is perfect right now.

90
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,720
It'll be all ruined if I go in there.

91
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,150
Is that okay with you?

92
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,600

93
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,310
Let's just have a happy life separately.

94
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:40,120

95
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,030
 Are you not coming?

96
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,470
 We should still eat dinner together.

97
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,510
I'm really in a bad mood.

98
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,610
I just can't eat dinner together tonight.

99
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,200
I feel like I can throw up while eating.

100
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,010
 You can't get out of the bad mood by yourself.

101
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,760
 Come back.

102
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,190
 Okay?

103
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,050
 It's a present for you.

104
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,940
This is Toto's favorite– Kelp soup with flounder.

105
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,130
His grandmother always made this for him on his birthday.

106
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,270
Also, isn't the bulgogi cooked well today?

107
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,830
Yes.

108
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,660
You're back.

109
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,190
Toto, what you have to do right now

110
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:50,590
is enjoy the food right in front of you.

111
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,470
 Yu Ri, what you have to do right now

112
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:03,290
 is enjoy this food.

113
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,390
Don't fret over things that you can't do anything about it.

114
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,090
It's the first time to see Toto's tear.

115
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,880
I must be crazy. I feel stupid.

116
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,320
My parents had me when they were eighteen.

117
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:37,980
They left me to my grandma and went out to make money.

118
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:43,090
I grew up going around other people's houses.

119
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,840
And then...

120
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,680
the things came to what it is now.

121
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,410
A family worse than strangers.

122
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,600
It would've been easier if we were strangers.

123
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,730
But, Toto,

124
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,890
the start of a family doesn't make sense from the beginning.

125
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:13,110
A man and a woman who were strangers before suddenly gather and live in the same house.

126
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,210
And they suddenly have a child.

127
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:23,270
In a way, people are making new sufferings all the time in the name of family.

128
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:27,150
So many things you would've not experienced if you were alone,

129
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,100
but you go through a ton of it because of the family.

130
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,920
She's right.

131
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,630
It must have been harder because it's a family.

132
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,310
As much as you trust and expect each other,

133
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,980
you feel more betrayed.

134
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,670
In fact, I also...

135
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:49,680
thought a lot about wanting to live with my parents.

136
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,820
But when I see them,

137
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,670
I get angry first.

138
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:03,310
I don't know why I'm like this as well.

139
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:11,350
Still, it's hard for each other if you postpone the time of forgiveness for too long.

140
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:16,480
And maybe it's harder for the one who doesn't forgive.

141
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:47,700

142
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,810
 Are you not going to go out?

143
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,180
 It's not Wu Hyeon's fault.

144
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:47,870
 Even if it's Wu Hyeon's dad's fault, how can I still see Wu Hyeon?

145
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,110
 How is that possible?

146
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:41,560
 It's hard for each other if you postpone the time of forgiveness for too long.

147
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,310
 And maybe it's harder for the one who doesn't forgive.

148
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,010
Hello?

149
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:04,630
 Hello? Yu Ri, did you get the bonus for the consoling?

150
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,230
 A lot came in. How much did you get?

151
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,020
 I'm on the phone. Can you go away for a second?

152
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,400
 Yu Ri.

153
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,360
Yes, I've checked.

154
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,420
 You said you are going to see your dad today, right? Take your time.

155
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,600
Okay, I will.

156
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,070
 Kaka, don't touch that cookie!

157
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,450
 That's for Yu Ri!

158
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,500

159
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:01,730
 Let's bet who blows the biggest bubble with this bubble gum.

160
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:04,460
 I'll give 10,000 won to the winner.

161
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,000
 Okay, let's start!

162
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,480
 Wu Hyeon!

163
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,180
 Do you want to beat Yu Ri that much?

164
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,970
 I didn't know you carried other things around with you besides cigarettes.

165
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,640
 What? Did you already forget about it?

166
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,820
 When Yu Ri was a baby,

167
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,680
 she covered her nose and ran away from me because of the cigarette smell.

168
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,890
 So I always chew this gum when I'm coming home.

169
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,540
 This gum has the strongest scent.

170
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,480
 Was that so?

171
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,930
 Have some interest in your own son, too.

172
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,930
 By the way, you look very beautiful today, Mom.

173
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:04,410
 Why are you saying things that you don't say normally?

174
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,600
 Grandma.

175
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,080
 You are really beautiful.

176
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,800
 Right? There you go.

177
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,690
 He has a good eye.

178
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,560
 You drank too much. Stop it.

179
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:33,280
 "If you chew this gum, we are in a relationship starting today?"

180
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,770
 People do ridiculous things to sell gums.

181
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,600

182
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:56,010
Is it you, Wu Hyeon?

183
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,660

184
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,270
Here's the special menu you ordered, Cookie Choux. Enjoy.

185
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,720
 Did we get attached to each other by imitating a family?

186
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,510
 Sometimes, it felt like we had become a real family.

187
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,890
Good job, guys!

188
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,420
Where are you going?

189
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,260
Excuse me first tonight.

190
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,500
What's that in your hand?

191
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,660
He became a grown man. I thought he might need a razor.

192
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,250
Have a nice time together.

193
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,870
- Good night. 
 - Bye!

194
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,880
Practice the moves!

195
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:47,700
On the Big Island, the stars look as if it's right in front of your eyes.

196
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:53,040
Did you live alone while you were in Hawaii?

197
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,450
Why would I?

198
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,290
Then did you have a lover?

199
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,180
Of course, I had!

200
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,530
How can you live alone in a place like that?

201
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,620
You are really awesome.

202
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,110
You took good revenge on your husband.

203
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,040
Did I?

204
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,780
Do you not see your family anymore?

205
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,970
I did my best, and I don't regret a thing.

206
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,940
I'm going to make money and go back to Hawaii.

207
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,190
I felt so betrayed.

208
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,820
And I suffered a lot from depression.

209
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,850
I was just alive because I couldn't die.

210
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:48,800
And one day, I happened to pass by a travel agency.

211
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,410
And I saw a poster with Hula dancers.

212
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,410
At that moment, I thought, "That's it!"

213
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,460
"I'm going to go to Hawaii and learn the Hula dance."

214
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,890
That thought came up to me.

215
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,670
Hula dance out of nowhere?

216
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,430
Why?

217
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,760
What would've been the reason?

218
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,100
I don't know why I thought of it as well.

219
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,270
Anyway...

220
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,140
Whenever I felt like I wanted to die,

221
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:25,020
I pictured myself doing the Hula dance.

222
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,720
Because of that simple and brash dream,

223
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,700
I might have endured until now.

224
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,560
 You don't need a reason.

225
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,410
 You just dream it.

226
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:52,320
 You are eccentric sometimes.

227
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:57,000
 When I have hard times or struggles,

228
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,200
 I think of going to Finland.

229
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,210
 Just thinking about that makes me feel better.

230
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,510
She's so funny.

231
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,050
 - What about Mom? 
 - She's sleeping on the couch.

232
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,910
 Hey, you are a first-grader.

233
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:34,660
 You should be in bed but are playing with your mom's phone. You are going to get scolded.

234
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,340
 This is all because of Mom.

235
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,810
 She worked all day in a restaurant

236
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:45,220
 but came home and nagged me about my homework and stuff.

237
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,560
 I also have to relieve my stress before going to bed.

238
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,680
 Why are you so good at speech, child?

239
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,930
 Oh! Mom woke up.

240
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,900
 She's trying to take the phone away.

241
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:13,030
 Mom scolded me for going to bed late.

242
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,740
Don't get angry at Hae Yun.

243
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,780
 Seung Yun...

244
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,720
Good night.

245
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,580
Shall we clean up and go home now?

246
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,880
No, I can clean here by myself.

247
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,480
I came to work late today, so I should make that time up.

248
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,830
Are you sure you'll be okay?

249
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,720
Of course, we cleaned up the rest already.

250
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,250
The only thing left is the garden tables.

251
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,840
I knew you would say that.

252
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,560
Thank you for taking care of the rest.

253
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,340
- You got this. 
 - Get home safe.

254
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,860
Can you give me a ride on your motorcycle?

255
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,880
I didn't bring it with me today.

256
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,860
Hey, young lady.

257
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,300
We are closed now.

258
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,640
Lee Yong Beom is here, right?

259
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,220
Yong Beom?

260
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,540
Oh, it's Kaka's name. Yes, he is.

261
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,550
Where is he now?

262
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,730
He's not here at the moment.

263
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,860
Is that so?

264
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:59,070
Who are you? Are you his daughter?

265
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:01,650
I heard this cafe is a family business.

266
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,580
Yes, I'm the daughter.

267
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,300
Oh, really?

268
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,110
Then shall we go inside and have a talk?

269
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,840
Let's go inside.

270
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,310
We are closed tonight.

271
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,470
Lee Yu Ri!

272
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:48,110
♫  When the night is over,  ♫

273
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,680
♫  As if the morning comes again,  ♫

274
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:55,510

275
00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:01,920
♫  Since my love, you are next to me  ♫

276
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:07,350
♫  I'm not afraid of anything in this world  ♫

277
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:14,770
♫  I'm not afraid of anything in this world  ♫

278
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:22,380
