1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:10,540

2
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,640

3
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,090

4
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:32,210

5
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,820
We are closed.

6
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,800
What?

7
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,400
"The store is closed"?

8
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,360
Lee Yu Ri!

9
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,460
Who the heck is he?

10
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,940
Yong Jun, how did you come here?

11
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,640
Isn't the store closed now?

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,520
Yes.

13
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,800
Then we will come back when your dad is around.

14
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,720
We'll see you then.

15
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,870
Are we really just going?

16
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:18,000
Really? Wait for me!

17
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,470
Yong Jun, what brings you here?

18
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,960
What?

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,350
Well, I have something to tell you urgently.

20
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,030
What did you want to say?

21
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,450
Yes, the thing is...

22
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,290
Ji Yong Jun, what did you want to talk about?

23
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,870
Why did you suddenly come to see me?

24
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,160
This is driving me crazy...

25
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,990
What is that face?

26
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:06,160
I know it might sound strange for me to say this out of the blue.

27
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,800
But actually, I loved... I had feelings for you!

28
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,060
What are you talking about right now?

29
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,650
I have no idea as well.

30
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,750
Wow, this is really driving me crazy!

31
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,170
Let's put jokes aside.

32
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,620
Thank you if you take that as a joke.

33
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,770
You don't feel a thing even if I say I had feelings for you, right? Then that's good.

34
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,630
What are you talking about it?

35
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,630
Did you come to see me at this hour to say that?

36
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:38,450
I know. I know!

37
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,530
Why did I do that?

38
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:49,200
It's very late. I'll get going first.

39
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,250
All right.

40
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,270
It's insane!

41
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,580

42
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,160
Hey.

43
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,680
I didn't have a script for it.

44
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,360
A script for it.

45
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,440
I didn't have anything to say, so I dropped a bomb.

46
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,330
I shouldn't have said something like that! This is crazy!

47
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,600
Do I get it back like this?

48
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,730

49
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,910

50
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,660

 "If you chew this gum, we are in a relationship starting today"?

62
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,280
 What's this? I found this in your jacket pocket.

63
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,240
 - It's nothing. 
 - Wait, who are you in a relationship with?

64
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,490
 I said it's not something like that.

65
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,670
 Wait! Are you dating someone?

66
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,150
 I said no!

67
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,580
 It's just gum wrapping.

68
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,120
 Why would you carry gum wrapping around?

69
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,090
 Seriously...

70
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,670
 It's the girl from the academy, right?

71
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,430
 The girl, whom?

72
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,660
 You know, the top student of the Yeongdo Girls' High!

73
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,450
 The one who only lets you look at her notes.

74
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,000
 No!

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,790
 Be honest with me, you punk!

76
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,020
 Seriously, stop it.

77
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,520
 Is there a story that you can't share with me?

78
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,550
 What is it? What's the reason?

79
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,470
 What? No way.

80
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,310
 You are not dating Lee Yu Ri, are you?

81
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,940
 Right?

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,430
 What's going on here?

83
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,030
 Is it...

84
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,080
 Is it me?

85
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,140
 What?

86
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:47,850
 My friend, don't do this! We are just good friends!

87
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,800
 You ruined everything.

88
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,830
 Yu Ri!

89
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:59,080
 Sure, go after her.

90
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,990
 I should let him go.

91
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,850
 Let go of me. What are you guys so funny about?

92
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:06,780
 Yu Ri.

93
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,910
 What kind of girl would like a guy who asks her out like a joke?

94
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,030
 You have no idea how I feel.

95
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,000
 I...

96
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,680
 I have feelings for you.

97
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,290
 I have feelings for you.

98
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,010
 I have feelings for you.

99
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,470
 Grandma, I'm hungry.

100
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,860
 By the way, what were you doing?

101
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,220
 I was praying.

102
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,220
 What? You don't have any religion.

103
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,790
 I was praying for gratitude.

104
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:34,390
 When I receive good energy from others, my heart overflows with gratitude.

105
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:38,300
 Then it makes me naturally pray.

106
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,630
 Thanking for everything.

107
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,310
 What are you so thankful for?

108
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:48,720
 I think I have to win a lottery to be that thankful.

109
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,240
 Is that so?

110
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,900
 I'm thankful every day.

111
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:59,790
 I'm even thankful just by looking at you enjoying the rice cake.

112
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,890
 What?

113
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,560
 Yu Ri.

114
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,980
 If someone gives you a good heart, you must repay for it.

115
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,800
 A good heart?

116
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:21,350
 You know, something that makes you feel heartwarming.

117
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:28,000
 When you feel something like that, it means you have received a good heart from someone.

118
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,780
Yu Ri.

119
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,460
What's this?

120
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,080
Take a look.

121
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,820
I'll get going.

122
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,330
 Yong Jun, I just wanted to make food for you.

123
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,330
 Something about you looks awesome.

124
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:27,690
 I learned from you that hiding and holding back is also courage.

125
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,140
 Thank you, my wonderful friend.

126
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,350

127
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:43,350
 Grandma, I think I'm getting stronger, little by little.

128
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:48,020

129
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,000
 I'm here to register for the advanced class.

130
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,860
Hey, Lee-Ddang! It's been a while.

131
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,120
How did you find me here? Let's go outside and talk.

132
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,060
Don't touch me.

133
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,440
Hey, Lee-Ddang. I heard your nickname comes from swooping everything in two seconds.

134
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,730
But are you trying to play hooky?

135
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:19,220
I mean, if you took the stakes, you got to leave half of it.

136
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,850
But how dare you take it and run away?

137
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,440
- What's going on here? 
 - Don't worry. It's nothing.

138
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,390
Give me the money that you took.

139
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,120
I won that money!

140
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,320
And I don't gamble anymore. Please leave now.

141
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,150
Are you out of your mind?

142
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,610
Do you think all the money you won at the gamble is yours?

143
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,690
Excuse me, Sir. You can't act like this here.

144
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:40,160
Stay out of this, Lady.

145
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,920
Hey, go through all of that, and let's take everything.

146
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,910
Stop it! Get out of my way.

147
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,200
Hey, don't touch it!

148
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,850
- Sir, what are you doing? 
 - I said stop it!

149
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,230
Sir, why don't you stop it now?

150
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,600
Stop it!

151
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,080
Hey!

152
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,100
Get out of here right now!

153
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,710
Really! Get out of here, you bastards!

154
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,120
Lee Yong Beom, I'll be back. Prepare my money.

155
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,400
You have a beautiful daughter! You better protect her well as a father.

156
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,000
Seriously! Put those things down. Let's go.

157
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,720
Wait!

158
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,410
They came by last night as well.

159
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,010
Really?

160
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,800
They think we are a real family.

161
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,450
So I just said I'm your daughter.

162
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,070
I see.

163
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:57,000
I should stop working here.

164
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,130
If I stay here longer, it'll make everyone suffer.

165
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,400
How are we going to run the cafe at this rate?

166
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:19,440
We are getting a day off tomorrow. It says it's a day off tomorrow.

167
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,860
Really?

168
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:29,900
"Thanks to all the family members of Finland Papa, the cafe is running well."

169
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,010
"I'll provide a car, picnic sets, and necessary expenses."

170
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:38,400
"I hope you forget about the worries and rest and recover tomorrow."

171
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,680
It's a day off!

172
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,550
A day off!

173
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,980

174
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,360
That's right. Shall we pack a lunch box tomorrow?

175
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,250
Yes, I think it'll be great to pack lunch and share the food together.

176
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,930
It's a hassle to pack lunch.

177
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:02,780
I know you'll do it.

178
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,050
I live in a tiny room where it doesn't have a kitchen.

179
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,820
Also, you know that I can only make instant ramen.

180
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,020
Is that so?

181
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,370
What if we cook all together right here?

182
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,720
Exactly. Let's pack the lunch together.

183
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,220
Shall we make lots of different dishes?

184
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,280
Yes!

185
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,370

186
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,850

187
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,490

188
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:07,450

189
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,570

190
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,980

191
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,510
Sorry.

192
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,690
This is so easy.

193
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:38,680
Just put oil on low heat and grill it.

194
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,280
You can't grill this!

195
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,460
What is this?

196
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,780
When did you put money in there?

197
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,590
This way, I feel relieved.

198
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:55,190
I still have nightmares where those guys take my money away.

199
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:08,610

200
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,120
It looks so cute!

201
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,520
Actually, this menu is my son's favorite.

202
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,680
But I used to make this without the cheese because I don't like it.

203
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,210
Then he would put the cheese on it himself,

204
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:55,480
heat it up in the microwave and eat it.

205
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,680
The little boy who did that is now in college.

206
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,350
Let's try it.

207
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,430
How is it? Is it good?

208
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,880
It will taste better if you control the temperature when you are frying.

209
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,070
He's right.

210
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:18,280
Then shall I try again and bring it to my son?

211
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,140
Yes, he'll love it!

212
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,270
Ta-da!

213
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,760
When my grandma made sandwiches for me,

214
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,380
I used to cut off the edges and only ate the center part.

215
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,630
Then she would eat the edges that I cut off.

216
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,710
If I asked her why she would eat that, she said it's delicious.

217
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:46,000
I think we all did that when we were young.

218
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,230
We all did.

219
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:52,320
My mom also used to eat things that didn't look tasty to me.

220
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,670
And I thought she was eating because it was actually delicious.

221
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,470
Right.

222
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,770
This is good!

223
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:03,460
If I made it like this, my grandma would've loved it.

224
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,590
It's really good!

225
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,690
I guess Toto's good at cooking

226
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,610
because of his thoughts for his grandmother.

227
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,720
That's unexpected to hear from you.

228
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,790
Isn't this so pretty? Yu Ri made it.

229
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,920
Bibimmyeon with dried pollack?

230
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,060
Yes. I heard it was my dad's favorite.

231
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,660
My grandma raised my dad alone and had to work.

232
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:32,530
So she often made things to eat quickly, like rice balls and bibimmyeon.

233
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:36,640
Then he didn't get tired of it and always ate well.

234
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:41,440
Also, there's a delicious way to eat these rice balls and bibimmyeon.

235
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,100
My grandma taught me this.

236
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,050
Wrap the noodles around the rice ball,

237
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,780
and eat it in one bite.

238
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,640
It's so good.

239
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,700
One, two, three!

240
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,080
Picnic is also always together!

241
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,300

242
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:53,900
 Do you happen to know me?

243
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,630

244
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,790
 Yong Jun, can you go to where Yu Ri is right now?

245
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,850
Don't you need to tell her now?

246
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,740
I need to do so.

247
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,690
But I don't have the courage to say it.

248
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,570
It's not your fault.

249
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:49,380
If your friend's father killed your father,

250
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,110
would you be able to see that friend?

251
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,850
It won't be easy.

252
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,630
But if she finds out later what you hid,

253
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,720
she wouldn't feel okay about it as well.

254
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,590
I didn't do it on purpose.

255
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,730
But it turned out like this.

256
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,010
I wished Yu Ri to have a family.

257
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,680
I started with that intention.

258
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:28,670
Yu Ri might have sensed it a little.

259
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,710
Hey, it's Yu Ri.

260
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,360

261
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:46,760
- Hey. 
 - Why are you drinking beer alone?

262
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,790
Here, have this.

263
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,620
I went on a picnic today.

264
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,290
- Was it fun? 
 - Yes.

265
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:02,370
It was very relaxing. I think my boss is a really good one.

266
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:06,520
Can't I get a part-time job over there as well?

267
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,880
You can't because you don't fit in the concept. You don't have a painful history.

268
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,980
My life is full of pain if you know about it.

269
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,630
Really?

270
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:25,460
Hey, today... I cried because of my dad.

271
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,100
Even when my dad died, or at his funeral,

272
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,540
or when I think about the memories with him, I never cried.

273
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:43,410
I wasn't sad or feeling sorry. I just couldn't tell what my feelings were.

274
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:47,780
My feelings when I think about my dad.

275
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:53,240
But... I finally figured it out today.

276
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,230
I figured out my feelings toward my dad.

277
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,990
What is it?

278
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,870
It's longing.

279
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:12,150
Since I was very young, I always missed my dad so much.

280
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:16,450
But I couldn't see him that often, so I guess I was sad about that.

281
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:22,980
I was sad, so I became awkward with him. So I couldn't say that I missed him,

282
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,820
or I wanted a hug from him.

283
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:33,850
Both my dad and Wu Hyeon couldn't reach out to me

284
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:37,930
because they felt sorry for me.

285
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,510
So if I had approached them first,

286
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:51,190
wouldn't my dad and Wu Hyeon never have left me?

287
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,780
Damn.

288
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,520
Did you find anything?

289
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,930
Are you sure the money is here?

290
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:40,600
Yes, there will be a bundle of cash.

291
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,630
He can't put any money in the bank since he's a credit defaulter.

292
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:48,360
- Let's keep looking for it. 
 - Where would it be?

293
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,620
What's going on here? Where's my money?

294
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,950
My money! Where is it?

295
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:17,900
Where did the money for my son's hospital bill go?

296
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,730
It's right here!

297
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,670
My money!

298
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:38,630
Thank you, my lord!

299
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,180
This is for my son's surgery.

300
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,820
Thank goodness, it's here.

301
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,660
Let's clean up now.

302
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,600

303
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,380
Wu Hyeon, it's you, right?

304
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,250
It's you, isn't it?

305
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:27,540
"We'll close the cafe for the time being?"

306
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,470
Oh my, did we lose our jobs?

307
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,640
I guess it's because the cafe feels unsettled.

308
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,220
He'll call us back.

309
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,960
It's a paid vacation!

310
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,430
Wow, a lot came in.

311
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,140
A paid vacation.

312
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,800
Yu Ri?

313
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,240
It's Wu Hyeon, isn't it?

314
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,900
I have no idea.

315
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,380
Be honest with me.

316
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,770
I said I don't know.

317
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:24,180
Ji Yong Jun! I'm serious right now.

318
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,760
It's Wu Hyeon, right?

319
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,620
Right?

320
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:34,570
It is right.

321
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,950
Why did he...

322
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:43,830
Why did he hide and trick me like that?

323
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,500
Lee Yu Ri.

324
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:52,840
If it were Wu Hyeon, he wouldn't have tricked you.

325
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,680
Then I guess he did it because he pitied that I had become alone.

326
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:01,060
Why do you interpret it like that? Let's say the owner of the cafe is Wu Hyeon.

327
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:05,170
Why can Wu Hyeon then now show himself to you and why is he hiding?

328
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:09,180
Have you ever thought about how Wu Hyeon would feel?

329
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,170
You told me this.

330
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:14,130
That you can't approach someone if you feel too sorry.

331
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,570
Didn't you think about that for him?

332
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,990
 Wu Hyeon understands how you feel.

333
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:29,010
 But you closed up your mind,

334
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:32,310
 so how can Wu Hyeon approach you first?

335
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,580

336
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,460
♫  When the night is over,  ♫

337
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:30,240
♫  As if the morning comes again,  ♫

338
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,100

339
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:40,260
♫  Since my love, you are next to me  ♫

340
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:45,640
♫  I'm not afraid of anything in this world  ♫

341
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:53,270
♫  I'm not afraid of anything in this world  ♫

342
00:29:55,150 --> 00:30:01,520
