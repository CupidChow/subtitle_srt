00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:09,465
*5 years ago

2
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:19,039
Sisi

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,239
Where's Zong Xia?

4
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:23,079
There were good opportunities for advancement back there

5
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:25,160
So of course she went back

6
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:26,440
No way

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,640
Why didn't you tell me she left?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,199
I told you

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,520
She's a very ambitious girl

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,640
You know what I mean?

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,439
No

12
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:47,039
The user you dialed is temporarily unable to connect

13
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:48,840
Please Redial Later

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,079
Zong Xia!

15
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,719
Look at this movie I just sent you

16
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:08,439
It's by a emerging director

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,000
Her previous film "The Summer Solstice Finale"

18
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,599
Is already booked for several awards

19
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,920
But,unfortunately

20
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,680
Her film's budget

21
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:17,000
Just isn't enough for what we need

22
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:20,599
..Yize..

23
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:23,760
She's back?

24
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,239
She's been back for years,actually

25
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,340
Sis.

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,920
Can you help me get an audition?

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:40,879
Miss Zong

28
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,359
You're talented, no doubt

29
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:45,840
But unfortunately

30
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,200
This role... it's not for you

31
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:50,780
Sorry

32
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,840
Aze

33
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:09,379
Aze<

34
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,340
Miss Zong

35
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,800
We're not exactly close, are we?<

36
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:19,699
...Okay

37
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,360
Director

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,840
I just wanted to ask

39
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,759
Was there something wrong with my acting?

40
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,919
You've improved a lot

41
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,879
But the truth is

42
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,120
It lacks sincerity

43
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,560
If a performance isn't sincere

44
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,120
it won't move anyone—no matter how well you act

45
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,159
You're just scared, aren't you?

46
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,120
Because you still have feelings for me

47
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,199
And you're afraid... that you can't keep it professional

48
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,599
Of course I'm scared

49
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,319
People like you disappear

50
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,599
What if it happens again?Middle of a shoot.Then what?

51
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,599
Would you really take responsibility for that?

52
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,360
Why didn't you ever tell her

53
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,680
About Qian SiSi, from back then

54
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,240
Everything she told you

55
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,800
Qian Sisi is her producer

56
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:30,000
If their relationship falls apart now

57
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,400
The whole film might fall through

58
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,319
You're way too kind sometimes

59
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,759
It's okay

60
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,039
I know

61
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,960
She said what? Not professional?

62
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:56,120
How could she just say that..

63
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,240
No shame at all

64
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,479
Me? Not professional?

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,120
Honestly?You turned down the one actor who fit the part

66
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,840
That was kinda unprofessional

67
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,800
She just leaves

68
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,199
And shows up

69
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,360
Whatever she wants

70
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,080
Look

71
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,159
I'm not the one

72
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,680
Who wants her back in your life

73
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,360
But professionally speaking..

74
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,879
You're the director of this film

75
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,800
So do you want to cast her or not

76
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:23,800
NO!

77
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,459
Absolutely not

78
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,319
Cut! Good. Playback!

79
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,399
Move faster, guys!

80
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,839
Do you want another take?

81
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,480
Uh uh... We can..

82
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,480
I—I—

83
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,519
Let's just run through...

84
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,399
The next blocking

85
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,560
Let me check..

86
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,800
The next is....

87
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,680
Is my eyeline a bit too high here?

88
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:32,800
It's... it's fine

89
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,560
Thanks

90
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,680
Thank you for giving me this chance

91
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,399
Well,with your current commercial value

92
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,279
Casting you was a team decision

93
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,120
It's okay

94
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,800
Our film has a long way to go

95
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,800
Time to change costumes

96
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,259
OK

97
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,199
Director, could you come check the props?

98
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:18,579
Sure

99
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,639
Calm down.You're a professional

100
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,480
S-sorry, Director! I..I'm so sorry!

101
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,720
It's fake,don't drink it!

102
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,240
Is there anything I can wear?

103
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,720
I...I didn't know you were here

104
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,160
Got something on my clothes

105
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,480
Gotta change

106
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,680
What do you think?

107
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:17,040
Is this okay for the next scene?

108
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,560
yeah... yeah..

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,600
You...you look great

110
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:24,160
Uh... I..I gotta go

111
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,240
What about makeup?

112
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,399
Will it look

113
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,079
Too heavy on camera?
