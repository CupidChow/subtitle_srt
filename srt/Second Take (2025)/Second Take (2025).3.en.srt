1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,719
What about makeup?

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,880
Will it look

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,759
Too heavy on camera?

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:15,919
No...no...

5
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:17,379
It's...

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:18,640
Pertty good

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,960
I..I'll just..

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,759
Still get scared?

9
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:48,240
It's okay

10
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,439
With you here

11
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,640
I'm not scared

12
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,680
Well...I gotta go..

13
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:37,459
Oh..right

14
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,140
The clothes..

15
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,379
Director!

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,280
This is Professor SunRuoShi

17
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,039
She's guest starring as Dr.Xu

18
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,280
Professor Sun, Nice to meet you

19
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,280
Professor Sun

20
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,680
Let's run through the script

21
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,280
Who is this Sun Ruoshi anyway?

22
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,080
Sisi said she's really popular online

23
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,800
Like...an influencer?

24
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,800
She's not just some influencer

25
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,520
She's a doctor—like,an actual PhD

26
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,639
And she also a college professor

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,680
Gets more popular than most celebs

28
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,000
She actually turned us down at first

29
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,159
But changed her mind a couple days ago

30
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,599
Director, you really know how to pull people in

31
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,159
Now Zong Xia and Sun Ruoshi

32
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:56,680
Both came to us on their own

33
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,240
Our film's totally gonna blow up

34
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,439
Professor Sun didn't show up just by luck

35
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,680
It's all about personal connections

36
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,080
Cause of Zong Xia

37
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,759
Obviously

38
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:07,560
Wha's that supposed to mean?

39
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,759
Sun is not just a medical PhD

40
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,840
Basically the Kristen Stewart of the L

41
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,240
She's had a crush on ZongXia for years

42
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,879
Everyone in the circle knows

43
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:14,759
You didn't hear that?

44
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,159
Let me see

45
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,719
Wow, is that Professor Sun?

46
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,680
Damn, she's hot

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,759
That pic of her and Zong Xia?

48
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,759
Total couple vibes

49
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,560
Don't they look perfect together?

50
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,199
I don't really see it

51
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:31,960
Come on—

52
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,199
She's really hot

53
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,800
Emmm...

54
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,360
What's wrong?

55
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,800
Oh,nothing..I get it

56
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,080
It's just..

57
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,199
No,seriously.You can say it

58
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,080
Look here

59
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,479
Shen Meng says"Stop the bleeding"

60
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,840
But Shen Meng's a resident

61
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,879
As my second assistant

62
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,120
Not something she'd do in surgery

63
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,759
Just prepping the tools

64
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,759
Disinfecting

65
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,800
Things like that

66
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,080
But like I said—

67
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,000
Make sense.

68
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,319
You're an artist

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,040
Not knowing this stuff is fine

70
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,160
Thanks for the suggestion,Professor Sun

71
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,079
Ajing

72
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,920
Tell the screenwriter to change this part

73
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,720
All good now

74
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,079
Lunch, Director?

75
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,000
Zong Xia

76
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,439
Professor Sun

77
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,519
I thought you wouldn’t come

78
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,279
I pushed everything to next month.

79
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,920
When a big star speaks

80
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,079
I can't exactly say no, can I?

81
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:45,920
You're looking thinner

82
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,639
Did you keep taking the vitamins I got you?

83
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,240
Yep.

84
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,680
We're starting soon

85
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,600
Lost a little bit

86
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,800
You're too thin

87
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,720
Break time yet?

88
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,399
Almost

89
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,720
Let's call it a day the

90
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,519
Just these two crew meals?

91
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,040
Leave it!

92
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,879
Let's go out to eat

93
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:13,319
I know a really good place nearby.

94
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:15,600
Sounds good

95
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,560
I'll buy you a meal to say thanks

96
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,079
Join us

97
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:19,959
Director?

98
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,680
No thanks, I'm more used to eating crew meals

99
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,839
Me too

100
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,439
Alright, let's go then.

101
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,519
Fine

102
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:35,360
Watch your step

103
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,079
Thanks

104
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,879
You really shouldn't be working so hard

105
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,959
It's really bad for your health.

106
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:00,560
Every time you're on set, you don't eat properly

107
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:03,000
You really need someone to take care of you

108
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,360
Good thing I'm here

109
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:05,459
Here

110
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,240
Anything you want to eat?

111
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,680
Professor Sun

112
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,519
Thank you for always taking care of me

113
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:21,160
Why the sudden politeness?

114
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,959
I've already given my heart to someone else
