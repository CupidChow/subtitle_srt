1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,439
Minutes of the ninth casting session

2
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:03,960
We've interviewed tons of actors

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,559
no time left, director

4
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:06,919
Nothing feels right

5
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,119
How do you expect me to choose

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,039
Investors want to begin this month,

7
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,359
and if you continue being so harsh

8
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:13,320
we might not even be able to start next year

9
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:14,800
There are areas

10
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,960
where it's better to compromise

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,800
Romance movie...

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,640
Is it too much to ask for

13
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:25,399
a truly captivating protagonist

14
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,760
There are several good ones

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,519
It's not a problem if they're captivating

16
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,960
it's a problem if they're captivating you Director

17
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,520
your criteria are too subjective

18
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,200
All right.Stop splitting hairs

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,799
One last actor will come in later

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,239
and if she's not up to it

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,359
we should not start the project at all

22
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,439
Okay I'll take a look later

23
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,519
Are you waiting for me

24
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:42,680
Miss Zong

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,500
Hello

26
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,319
Haven't seen you for a long time

27
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,400
Miss Zong

28
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,080
Emmm

29
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,039
Hello

30
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,199
It's all ready here

31
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,680
Don't you dare look me in the eye

32
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,479
and tell me this is all a lie.

33
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,159
There's no such thing as a misunderstanding in this world

34
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,439
It's just a sudden lack of love

35
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,920
Didn't you know I was like this

36
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,160
when you first met me

37
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,279
What do you mean by questioning me now

38
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,319
We're all just flirtation

39
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,839
If you take it seriously

40
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,800
you're asking for trouble

41
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,959
Is an actror of ZongXia's caliber

42
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,600
willing to come to our movie

43
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:44,720
I heard that she even asked for it on her own initiative

44
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,879
so it's a sure thing now

45
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:53,920
Miss Zong

46
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,399
You are indeed a outstanding actor

47
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:58,920
but sadly

48
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,199
you're not quite right for this role

49
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,560
Sorry

50
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,000
I've been with her since she was a little girl

51
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,040
I know her best

52
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:23,279
and this relationship is just a pastime for her

53
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,480
A girl in your situation

54
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,279
has a few at every stage

55
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,959
I'm used to it

56
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:30,680
But in the future

57
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,000
whether as a business partner or otherwise,

58
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,000
I will be the one who will always be there for her

59
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,920
I want to hear YiZe tell me by herself

60
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,000
It doesn't matter what she say

61
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,519
it's what she does

62
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,920
If she were serious about you

63
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,920
Why would she apply to stay

64
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,759
She knows clearly

65
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,000
that her family won't let her go into the arts

66
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,360
You probably don't know that yet

67
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,920
do you?

68
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,240
Now that you have decided to go back

69
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,639
I hope you can end this relationship

70
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,519
maturely and decently

71
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,399
and stop causing each other problems

72
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,839
Save yourself some self-respect
