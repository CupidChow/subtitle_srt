00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:08,099
Cheers!

2
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,600
Zong Xia's in a bad mood today.

3
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:21,559
Started drinking nonstop the moment she sat down

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,679
No one could stop her

5
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:23,879
Director!

6
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:25,760
If you've got personal issues

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,879
Deal with them in private

8
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:28,199
Don't bring them into work

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,559
Zong Xia and I agreed to lower our pay for this role

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,960
Aze...

11
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:39,719
You're coming.

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,600
I knew you'd come for me

13
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:44,200
Let's go home

14
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:45,859
Mi-jie

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,759
I'll drive her back.

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,439
Okay.

17
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:08,959
Wait.

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,400
What is it?

19
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,840
Is your stomach acting up again?

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:22,900
I'm fine.

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,280
Just drive.

22
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,959
Stealing kisses on the road isn't safe.

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:29,920
Let's go.

24
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,480
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,200
About earlier today…

26
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:37,480
I wasn't being very mature.

27
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,120
Back then

28
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,400
were you hurting too?

29
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,439
Ready?

30
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:10,800
Director.

31
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,560
Cut! Good!

32
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,520
Good! Good! Good!

33
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,519
Good! Props reset!

34
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,759
You okay, Director?

35
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,399
Y-yeah, I'm fine.

36
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,480
I meant my performance

37
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,319
It was great

38
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:33,040
Very natural, perfect pacing.

39
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,519
Good to hear. I'll prep for the next scene.

40
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,000
Zong Xia.

41
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,720
Ms. Zong Xia.

42
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:43,920
last night

43
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,000
BTW, I got kinda drunk last night

44
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,120
Thanks for taking care of me.

45
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,519
Coffee's on me later.

46
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,079
Aren't you hot?

47
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:03,579
Director?

48
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,680
I'm so hot

49
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:20,040
Last night, I—

50
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,600
You got bitten, right? By mosquitoes?

51
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,040
The ones at our hotel are vicious.

52
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,519
Look what they did to our poor director

53
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,680
Yep..

54
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,199
Can you cover it?

55
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,079
Of course! Let me see.

56
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:32,699
Done.

57
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,540
Wow!

58
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,519
You're really good!

59
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,959
I've covered way too many mosquito bites.

60
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,620
Amazing.

61
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,279
You guys won't believe this—

62
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,399
In the makeup room today...

63
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,800
I was covering Yi Ze’s neck...

64
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,120
Director!

65
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,040
Hello, Director!

66
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,480
I'm done eating, I'll head out first

67
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,399
Xiao Ke, you're done too, right?

68
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,480
You're finished too?

69
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,240
Not yet!

70
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,120
Secrets in the makeup room

71
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,720
Might as well be shouted on set.

72
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:14,639
No difference at all.

73
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,000
Just admit it.

74
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,600
Hey, I never denied anything.

75
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,199
Mm-hmm. Sure you didn't.

76
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,240
Well..

77
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,519
What kind of charming, irresistible, adorable mosquito

78
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,399
Would go for our brilliant Director's neck?

79
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,079
So you didn't forget, huh?

80
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,839
Did you want me to forget?

81
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,800
Uh—I'm full.

82
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,560
Don't fall for it again.

83
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,279
Get a grip.

84
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,800
What if she's really changed?

85
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,920
Should I talk to her?

86
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,379
No.

87
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,079
Absolutely not

88
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,160
Pathetic.

89
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,399
I've decided to step back for now.
