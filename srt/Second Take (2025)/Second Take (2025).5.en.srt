1
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:14,679
Just stay here, okay?

2
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:16,679
I'll let you know when they're gone

3
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:20,600
Don't overthink it

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,440
I just really hate stuff like that, that's all

5
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:26,640
Hey…

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,199
Stay with me for a bit?

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,239
Can you try the scene with me?

8
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:33,560
I still can't get into that emotional scene this afternoon

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,399
But if I'm looking at you…

10
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:37,320
I know I'll find it

11
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:40,880
That's funny

12
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,560
I remember you being real good at faking love

13
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:51,840
Zong Xia

14
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,600
What's going on?

15
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,000
Why are you acting like this all of a sudden?

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,520
Just tell me one thing

17
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,520
Are you planning to go back after graduation?

18
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,359
Sisi said there’s a great internship here

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,959
If I stay and get a year of experience

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,359
it’ll make things easier when I do go back

21
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:11,319
I… we…

22
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,280
Sisi...

23
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:16,359
Are you two planning to work together forever?

24
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,519
She's a great partner...

25
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,680
Wait—are you...

26
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,480
Jealous?

27
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,040
There's nothing between us, I swear

28
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,519
I moved out

29
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,879
Because I didn't want you clinging to me like this

30
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,120
Can't you have some self-respect?

31
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,280
Look at my eyes

32
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,879
Tell me it was all fake

33
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,159
That you don't love me anymore

34
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,519
This is what I hate about you

35
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,040
You act like such a child,always

36
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,319
I..

37
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:05,239
I am an actor

38
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,520
What we had?Just another role to play

39
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,319
As long as there's a part...

40
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
I can play it with anyone

41
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,680
You're a professional actor

42
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,759
It shouldn’t matter who you're acting with

43
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,280
Director

44
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,840
Boss Li got everyone coffee

45
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,120
I brought some to share

46
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,340
Okay.

47
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,719
Zong Xia?

48
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,639
I'll take it to her

49
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,960
Zong Xia!

50
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,240
Zong Xia!

51
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:12,639
Director, do you want one?

52
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,280
She can't have cold drinks these days

53
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,520
I'm a bit tired

54
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,120
Okay, let's go.

55
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,240
She even knows that?

56
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,759
Of course—you're like this with everyone.

57
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,120
Was it necessary to change this scene?

58
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:57,639
I just think

59
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,120
this way

60
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,879
It really shows how heartless she can be

61
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,960
And for you—

62
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,120
This one shouldn't be hard at all

63
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:12,780
Sure.

64
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,040
I moved out because I didn't want you

65
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,879
clinging to me like this anymore

66
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,439
Can't you have some self-respect?

67
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,600
Cut! Not enough emotion.

68
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,399
Again!

69
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,319
Can't you have some self-respect?

70
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,160
Cut! Again!

71
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,079
I moved out because I didn't want you

72
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:51,879
Clinging to me like this.

73
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,600
Can't you have some self-respect?

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Cut. One more.

75
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,040
I moved out

76
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:08,040
because I didn't want you clinging to me like this anymore.

77
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,399
Can't you have some self-respect?

78
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,160
Wrap!

79
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,540
Director

80
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,439
Zong Xia just left

81
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,439
Who said I was looking for her?

82
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,839
I'm here for Xiao Ke

83
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,240
Xiao Ke left with her

84
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,519
Sisi dragged them off to have drinks with Boss Li

85
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:55,959
Boss Li?

86
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,680
Hey, sweetheart

87
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,040
Come have a drink with us

88
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,959
Don't be shy!

89
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,360
Hope we can work together again next time

90
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,160
Cheers!

91
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,600
Director...?

92
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:31,879
Have a seat

93
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:32,800
Sit, sit.

94
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:37,279
Directo's just dropping by to say hi

95
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:37,779
Right?

96
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:43,759
Go ahead, keep drinking

97
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,519
Don’t mind us

98
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,920
Come on, no need to be shy

99
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,480
I just heard from someone

100
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,759
said she was brought here for dinner.

101
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,560
Do I look like someone

102
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,879
who'd make cast members drink with investors?

103
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,079
just asked her to swing by and say hi

104
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,199
Gave her an excuse to leave right after

105
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,519
Wait, but what about you?

106
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
You've been drinking too, haven't you?

107
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,279
I'm fine, I'm fine.

108
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:25,560
I slipped her off to the place next door

109
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:28,920
Yize.

110
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,399
I promised your parents I'd look after you

111
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,240
But ever since Zong Xia joined the crew

112
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,240
I've never seen you this careless—

113
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,639
professionally speaking

114
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,480
I have to remind you

115
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,759
Think hard about what you're doing

116
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,480
Is it really worth it?

117
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,759
And—

118
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,240
as the producer of this project

119
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,160
I don‘t want to see

120
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,439
Anything like this afternoon's

121
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,560
unexplained shutdown happen again

122
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,120
Got it?

123
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,319
Got it.

124
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,279
Go on.

125
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,240
Boss Li—

126
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,879
sorry about that

127
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:19,959
Cheers!

128
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,399
Zong Xia's in a bad mood today.

129
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,360
Started drinking nonstop the moment she sat down

130
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,360
No one could stop her

131
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,679
Director!

132
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,200
If you've got personal issues

133
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,360
Deal with them in private

134
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,720
Don't bring them into work

135
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,000
Zong Xia and I agreed to lower our pay for this role

136
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,080
Aze...

137
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,919
I knew you'd come for me

138
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,840
Let’s go home.
