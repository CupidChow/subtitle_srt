1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,480
Anything you want to eat?

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,919
Professor Sun

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,760
Thank you for always taking care of me

4
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:22,359
Why the sudden politeness?

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,039
I've already given my heart to someone else

6
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:27,960
I see

7
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:30,039
You've reminded me many times

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,600
I'll hold back a little

9
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,399
Sorry

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,240
Don't apologize, you did nothing wrong

11
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:39,840
OK

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,759
Let's order

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,000
We have to get back to the set soon

14
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:57,399
In my opinion

15
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:58,399
the relationship between Dr.Sun and Miss Zong seems unusual

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,799
When she joined the group

17
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:02,119
She also bought a large bouquet of flowers for Miss Zong

18
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:02,799
An actor

19
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:03,479
A doctor

20
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:05,519
This is straight out of a romantic comedy drama!

21
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:07,760
I really think they're the perfect couple!

22
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,719
Director, what do you think？

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,920
In my view

24
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:17,560
You can focus more on your work

25
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,040
Stop gossiping

26
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,379
Understand？

27
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:26,079
This light will be…

28
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,680
OK, that's about it

29
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,560
Almost done

30
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,519
You can go and do your business first

31
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,019
OK

32
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,560
Director Yi Ze

33
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,519
Professor Sun, is there anything wrong?

34
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,840
I know what happened to you and Zong Xia

35
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,840
That happened a long time ago

36
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,120
I can feel that Zong Xia still has feelings for you

37
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,760
But I really like Zong Xia

38
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,840
If you're not interested in her romantically

39
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,359
I will take back what I said.

40
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,200
Certainly

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,879
If you want to compete fairly

42
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,280
I'll accept it completely, too

43
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,920
Professor Sun

44
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,280
I think you can write scripts in your spare time

45
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,400
You're pretty good at making up stories

46
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,639
Director, are you here to find me

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,479
Yes

48
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,879
I come here for reminding you not to be late in the afternoon

49
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,199
Wait a moment

50
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,280
I bought your favorite dessert

51
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,159
See you in the afternoon

52
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:40,979
Thanks

53
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,240
Director, the actor is here

54
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:57,759
Director

55
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,079
The actor is here

56
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,319
Oops

57
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,240
Lights, camera, action!

58
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,519
Cut, pass

59
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,439
Pass, check the playback

60
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,519
Director, they haven't finished yet

61
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,399
I think it's enough

62
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,319
Shipping them like crazy

63
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,360
They look like they belong together

64
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,720
Let's develop a romantic subplot featuring them, director

65
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,600
You want to see it, right?

66
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,680
Come here, set, take the director's chair

67
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,199
Mr. Li, please

68
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,800
This is our actor

69
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,000
No need to introduce

70
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,319
Of course I know Miss Zong

71
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,079
Miss Zong

72
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,120
I'm your huge fan!

73
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,560
Initially, I had no intention of investing in this production

74
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,600
I heard you're coming to participate

75
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,920
I paid immediately!

76
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,600
Miss Zong is so beautiful

77
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,360
Director Yi Ze，what‘s wrong？

78
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:14,240
I'm looking for Miss Zong

79
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
I need to talk to her about the next scene

80
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,079
Sorry

81
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,199
Let's go

82
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,160
Goodbye Mr. Zong
