16

Xiachan, are you alright?

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,120
(Why is it him?)

18
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,570
She already knows.

19
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,910
Until we find out what happened,

20
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,450
I want to stand on my father's side first.

21
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,160
What do we do now?

22
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,950
There's still one person left.

23
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,120
Chen Yuan.

24
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,450
Help!

25
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,790
Help!

26
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,540
Help! Help!

27
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,450
Xiaoren! Xiaoren!

28
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,160
Xiaoren, save me!

29
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,160
- Xiaoren!
- Go to hell!

30
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,750
- Xiaoren!
- Are you alright?

31
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,120
Xiaoren, he suddenly barged in

32
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,000
and was about to kill me.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,840
Are you alright?

34
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,950
I'm fine.

35
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,620
Thank goodness you came in time.

36
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,090
Impossible.

37
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,370
You're still alive?

38
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,950
It was you who poisoned me.

39
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,080
Indeed, I poisoned you.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,700
His Majesty treated me with great kindness.

41
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,620
As a prince,

42
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,620
you want to kill the Emperor and rebel.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You deserve death.

44
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,410
Why didn't you go kill me

45
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,620
instead of coming here to kill her?

46
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,580
I saw you

47
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,910
drink the poisoned wine.

48
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,000
Though you're still holding on now,

49
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,950
you won't last seven days.

50
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,620
You're certain to die.

51
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,160
Why would I go kill you?

52
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,870
It was her.

53
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,450
She's unlucky.

54
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,330
She saw me bring the wine

55
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,410
into your room.

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,290
If she's asked about it later,

57
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,160
she will definitely report me.

58
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,260
So,

59
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,290
she had to die.

60
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,500
Hand him over to Mo Wei.

61
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,790
You said you work

62
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,370
for His Majesty.

63
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,640
Mr. Mo has been kind to me,

64
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,250
but the world

65
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,180
belongs to His Majesty.

66
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,510
It's only natural for me

67
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,100
to do things for His Majesty.

68
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,300
I'm sorry to Mr. Mo.

69
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,800
I've already let you go

70
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,680
and retire.

71
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,500
Why did you risk

72
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,720
going to kill someone?

73
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,760
Retire?

74
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,720
Easy for you to say.

75
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,450
My whole family's lives

76
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,580
are in His Majesty's hands.

77
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,970
How could I dare to betray His Majesty?

78
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,050
Lock him up first.

79
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,930
I'll interrogate him.

80
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,180
Mr. Mo,

81
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,960
there's something I need to ask.

82
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,890
Speak.

83
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,260
Don't make things hard for my descendants.

84
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,180
Okay.

85
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,580
I will

86
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,390
leave first.

87
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,130
Mr. Fu!

88
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,630
Mr. Fu!

89
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,180
Mr. Fu!

90
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,860
Rest assured.

91
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,460
I won't make things hard for your descendants.

92
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,820
I'll take good care of them.

93
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,020
There's poison

94
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,740
in his mouth.

95
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,540
Someone must be giving him orders.

96
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,220
Jun Mo!

97
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,260
He's inside. Please.

98
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,420
- This way, please.
- What are you doing?

99
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,900
This is Physician Liu from Herbs Mountain.

100
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,700
I had someone bring him here by fast horse.

101
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,410
- Quick!
- Hold on.

102
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,340
If you dare harm him,

103
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,740
I'll kill you immediately.

104
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,100
Let me check his pulse.

105
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,300
Quick!

106
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,140
Mr. Liu, how is he?

107
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,100
The poison has penetrated too deeply.

108
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,700
I'm afraid he won't last three days.

109
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,420
What nonsense are you talking about?

110
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,340
He promised me

111
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,580
nothing would happen.

112
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,020
Jun Mo.

113
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,860
Mother! Mother!

114
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,300
Just got word.

115
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,980
Jun Mo has finally died.

116
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,340
Shut up.

117
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,300
What are you afraid of, Mother?

118
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,500
Haven't you already deafened them

119
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,620
by piercing their eardrums?

120
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,340
Be careful with everything.

121
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,500
Have you got his body?

122
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,460
Not yet.

123
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,660
But the news says

124
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,220
he already drank your poisoned wine.

125
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,420
He must be dying.

126
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,060
He's mastered the Tuluo martial arts.

127
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,140
It's not so easy to kill him.

128
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,580
That's your special position.

129
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,260
No martial arts can protect him from it.

130
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,300
It's indeed not so easy to detoxify.

131
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,820
Mother,

132
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,140
I heard

133
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,780
that father's health isn't very good.

134
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,980
Am I going to ascend the throne soon?

135
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,140
Go back to your mansion.

136
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,460
If you dare come out,

137
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,460
I'll abolish you.

138
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,400
Little pendants!

139
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,370
Take a look! Candied haws!

140
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,730
Antiques! Calligraphy! Paintings! Take a look.

141
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,920
Alright. Take it.

142
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,370
Goodbye.

143
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,820
What are you two

144
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,060
following me for?

145
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,580
Why didn't you tell us

146
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,420
before leaving?

147
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,540
You're usually

148
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,660
very sweet.

149
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,740
I...

150
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,060
I just don't want

151
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,460
to stay in the villa anymore.

152
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,460
Come back with us.

153
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,420
Careful. She's skilled in martial arts.

154
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,260
Your kung fu is good.

155
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,500
Almost got me.

156
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,420
How did you know I knew martial arts?

157
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,860
A fox can hide its tail,

158
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,740
but the smell can't be hidden.

159
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,380
When Zhu Dabao chased after you,

160
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,500
I tested his strength.

161
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,420
It's strong

162
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,620
from training since childhood,

163
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,940
but your wrist turned and broke free.

164
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,340
It proves that your kung fu isn't weak.

165
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,820
Who let him entangle me?

166
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,820
I'm upset.

167
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,460
You don't need to kill him.

168
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,540
So what if I killed him?

169
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,340
I'll kill you two.

170
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,020
Two against one.

171
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,620
Let's see who dies first.

172
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
Is it two against one?

173
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,620
Or is it us against you two?

174
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,820
Looks like Xiaoren was right.

175
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,420
This woman

176
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,140
is either really naive

177
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,900
or she's got a snake's heart.

178
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,140
She must be the latter.

179
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,380
Still chattering away.

180
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,660
Kill her.

181
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,020
If we don't act now, we'll all die.

182
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,580
Zhao Xiaoren.

183
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,420
That's right.

184
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,660
This is "praying mantis stalks the cicada,

185
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,300
unaware of the oriole behind."

186
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,900
Aren't you close to death?

187
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,060
Thank you for your worries.

188
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,980
A mere poison

189
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,060
won't kill me in a short while.

190
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,100
How did you figure it out?

191
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,020
There was your rouge

192
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,700
on Zhu Dabao's body.

193
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,100
Kill me.

194
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,020
Want to die?

195
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,460
It's not so easy.

196
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,350
I'm not afraid of death.

197
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,950
I won't say anything.

198
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,120
Are you hungry?

199
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,080
Do you want something to eat?

200
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,140
Zhao Xiaoren,

201
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,500
you're the silliest among them all.

202
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,060
Save your crocodile tears.

203
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,180
What's the point?

204
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,140
Why look at me?

205
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,900
She's asking you

206
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,500
if you've had enough food

207
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,020
from working for the Empress.

208
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,020
I'm not working for the Empress.

209
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,300
You asked Mr. Fu to confess

210
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,660
he was working for Father intentionally

211
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,580
to clear the Empress's suspicion.

212
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,220
Don't act smart.

213
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,340
An assassin

214
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,900
confessed his master so soon.

215
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,380
Don't you find that irrational?

216
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,260
Even scripts wouldn't have such a plot.
