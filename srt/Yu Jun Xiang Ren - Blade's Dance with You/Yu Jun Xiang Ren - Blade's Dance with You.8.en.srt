I...

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,590
I don't understand what you're talking about.

18
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,630
If you tell me

19
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,830
how you got the jade pendant,

20
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,080
I'll make sure

21
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,040
we leave immediately.

22
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,040
You want to leave?

23
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,800
If you tell me,

24
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,080
I'll leave right now.

25
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,550
It's stuffy in here.

26
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:30,950
I want to go for a walk.

27
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,400
(Should I reveal my identity to him?)

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,200
Miss Chen.

29
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,040
Miss Chen, Miss Chen.

30
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,740
It's so late.

31
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,940
Mr. Zhu, please behave.

32
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,140
Miss Chen, I truly want to marry you.

33
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,100
Mr. Zhu,

34
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,020
today is the first day we've met.

35
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,860
Don't you think you're being too abrupt?

36
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,060
Miss Chen, I really like you.

37
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,460
My family runs a security agency.

38
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,780
My father, Zhu Hong, is well-known

39
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,860
in the martial world.

40
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,140
If you marry me,

41
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,780
you'll enjoy endless wealth and honor.

42
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,220
Mr. Zhu,

43
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,820
if you keep this up, I won't be polite.

44
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,460
What are you doing?

45
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,740
Xiachan, he's trying to harass me.

46
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,380
I'm not. Don't talk nonsense.

47
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,460
I truly want to marry you.

48
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,740
Isn't that a good thing?

49
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,740
Xiachan, what are you saying?

50
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,220
Though I'm alone and helpless,

51
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,020
I'm not at anyone's mercy.

52
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,620
Alone and helpless?

53
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,420
If Zhao Xiaoren

54
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,780
heard that,

55
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,660
she'd be heartbroken.

56
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,380
- I
- Besides,

57
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,260
if you're alone and helpless,

58
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,780
marrying Mr. Zhu

59
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,580
would give you support.

60
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,740
Mr. Zhu, don't you think I'm right?

61
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,460
Yes. You're right.

62
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,500
If you marry me,

63
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,060
I'll obey you

64
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,100
and never have second thoughts.

65
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,580
I'm not talking to you anymore.

66
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,060
I'll go talk to Xiaoren.

67
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,340
Miss Chen.

68
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,740
Move aside.

69
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,380
Miss Chen.

70
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,820
What strength!

71
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,740
There's only one cup.

72
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,340
I won't be polite then.

73
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,380
Always so aggressive.

74
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,940
Are you really happy?

75
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,140
What?

76
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,520
Do you want me

77
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,180
to tell you

78
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,660
my little secret?

79
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,220
What is Flash Sect?

80
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,820
It was you

81
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,820
on the roof.

82
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,060
If you don't say,

83
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,340
I can still find out.

84
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,260
Flash Sect isn't a sect

85
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,660
in the martial world.

86
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,980
And you

87
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,620
live a secluded life,

88
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,220
so it's not surprising you don't know.

89
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,300
Flash Sect is the world's

90
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,940
most powerful and secretive

91
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,180
assassin organization.

92
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,940
If Flash Sect wants someone dead,

93
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,380
not even the King of Hell can save them,

94
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,300
including you.

95
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,780
It's secretive
because it can't face the public.

96
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,620
It's powerful

97
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,540
because it hasn't met a real opponent.

98
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,540
Do you know

99
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,620
Zhao Xiaoren and Li Wei

100
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,020
are in love?

101
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,580
Both of them are from Flash Sect.

102
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,420
You do like her,

103
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,660
Zuo Xiachan.

104
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,540
Here comes your wife.

105
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,100
We didn't do anything.

106
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,260
Do you know this woman is a scorpion?

107
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,740
One sting and you're dead.

108
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,660
Thank you.

109
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,820
Why did you thank her?

110
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,700
Let's go.

111
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,380
What should I do?

112
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,020
I'm really

113
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,260
getting interested.

114
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,740
Let go of me.

115
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,500
Let go.

116
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,220
Zuo Xiachan is

00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,550
a famous black widow in the martial world.

118
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,820
Stay away from her.

119
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,900
Did you hear

120
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,180
what I just said?

121
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,420
I don't care who she is.

122
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,220

What nonsense are you talking about?

125
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,740
Are you looking for death?

126
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:48,860
I'm not talking nonsense.

127
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,180
Really.

128
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,420
I only care about you.

129
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,260

160
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,820
Jasmine Villa isn't a place

162
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,700

Don't let him get close.

167
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:42,900
Move.

168
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,420
(Yao,)

169
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,580
(I owe you and Master this life.)

170
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,900
(Maybe dying by your hand)

171
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,180
(is my best fate.)

172
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,540

00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,660
Are you crazy?

174
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,340
Why did you stop?

175
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,500
If you don't kill him,

176
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,940

If you can't kill him,

182
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,700
then leave here quickly.

183
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,060

Jun Mo!

187
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,340
Leave me alone.

188
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,540
Miss Chen left. I couldn't stop her.

189
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,900
What happened?

190
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,540
If someone wants to leave,

191
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,020
how can you stop them?

192
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,340
So what? I have to stop her.

193
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,580
I like her.

194
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,660
You just met her today.

195
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,460
So what?

196
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,220
One day, one year, a lifetime.

197
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,780
I just like her.

198
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,020
Time won't make a difference.

199
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,340
I'm not giving up.

200
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,860
I have to win her back.

201
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,780
Did you ask if she likes you?

202
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,460
I did.

203
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,980
She doesn't seem to like me.

204
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,300
And you're still going after her?

205
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,340
Of course, I have to.

206
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,690
She's not married.

207
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,700
I have to win her back.

208
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,900
Otherwise, I'll regret it for life.

209
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,260
(Regret it for life.)

210
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,140
I'm the one chasing her.

211
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,380
Why did you run ahead?

212
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,620
Jun Mo!

213
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,700
Candied hawthorn!

214
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,540
Xiaoren, I'll buy you

215
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,590
your favorite candied hawthorn.

216
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,260
I don't want it.

217
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,140
Candied hawthorn!

218
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,740
Wait, I want one.

219
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,620
Give me another.

220
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,140
Xiaoren,

221
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,220
I think

222
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,020
he wants to die by your hand.

223
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,470
I know.

224
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,100
Why is he doing this?

225
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,860
What did you say?

226
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,340
I said, why is he doing this?

227
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,390
Why?

228
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,170
Okay.

229
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,820
Sir, we'll take this.

230
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,940
(Why is he doing this?)

231
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,300
Before I die,

232
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,460
no one can take it from me.

233
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,860
In Chunhua Pavilion,

234
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,100
you were there to kill me.

235
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,620
You posed as Lu Zuo's daughter

236
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,020
to kill me.

237
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,140
What made you change your mind?

238
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,140
Because...

239
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,060
Because I...

240
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,900
Do you recognize this jade pendant?

241
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,100
(This silhouette)

242
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,580
(seems familiar.)

243
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,020
I'll hold you,

244
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,900
so your sadness will be shared with me.

245
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,620
I don't care who she is.

246
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,140
I only care

247
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,460
who you are.

248
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,540
What nonsense are you talking about?

249
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,780
Are you looking for death?

250
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,060
I'm not talking nonsense.

251
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,460
Really.

252
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,420
I only care about you.

253
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,740
You've had too much to drink.

254
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,460
Wake up.

255
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,950
He's Ran.

256
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,620
He's Ran.

257
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,280
