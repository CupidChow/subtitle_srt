Li Wei, come out!

18
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,090
Xiaoren,

19
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:10,750
what's wrong?

20
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,000
Hand it over.

21
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,660
Hand over what?

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,660
You must have stolen it.

23
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,000
Only you have the skills.

24
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,590
- Xiaoren.
- Xiaoren.

25
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,370
Xiaoren,

26
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,750
what are you looking for?

27
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,250
My father's notebook.

28
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,790
If you don't hand it over,

29
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,910
this won't end.

30
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,830
(Good thing she can't read.)

31
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,370
If a woman

32
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,950
doesn't like you,

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,950
the more you do,

34
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,450
the more she despises you.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,160
Let's leave this place.

36
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,000
Leave?

37
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,000
Have you forgotten the injustice

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,950
against the Twelve Generals?

39
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,250
Don't you want to clear your father's name?

40
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,370
I even forgot what he looks like.

41
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,380
Idiot.

42
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,950
A woman can turn you

43
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,040
into what you are now.

44
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,950
I regret saving you.

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,450
So what if you saved me?

46
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,450
You brought me into Flash Sect,

47
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,290
making me do dirty work.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,840
Alright.

49
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,620
After all these years, you finally

50
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,870
speak your mind.

51
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,620
From today on,

52
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,450
our sibling bond is over.

53
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,290
Xiachan.

54
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,750
If you have any conscience,

55
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,250
help me find the truth.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,840
Mo Wei,

57
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,660
I said if we meet again,

58
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,330
there's only one possibility.

59
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,370
Either you die,

60
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,160
or I die.

61
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,290
Yes.

62
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,660
Then die here.

63
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,620
The moment I finish speaking,

64
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,620
you can kill me,

65
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,250
Your Majesty.

66
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:49,790
Alright.

67
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,500
I want to hear

68
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,080
what you have to say.

69
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,620
It's about the Seventh Prince.

70
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,900
The Seventh Prince

71
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,340
wants to rebel.

72
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,340
So what?

73
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,900
I clipped his wings

74
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,740
when he was young.

75
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,220
Does he still want to fly?

76
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,380
Do you know

77
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,820
the Seventh Prince

78
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,300
has mastered

79
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,300
the Tuluo martial arts?

80
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,420
Where did he learn that?

81
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,540
Zhao Li left it for him.

82
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,660
You knew it all along,

83
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,300
hiding it from me.

84
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,460
Yes.

85
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,820
Not only did I know,

86
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,100
I personally guided him.

87
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,420
The Seventh Prince is no longer

88
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,300
a fish in the pond,

89
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,660
ready to be slaughtered.

90
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,500
He can become

91
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,220
a dragon

92
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,340
whenever he wants.

93
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,180
One person's martial arts

94
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,900
can't stand against thousands

95
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,260
of soldiers and arrows.

96
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,420
Your Majesty, how do you know

97
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,020
if I have

98
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,180
prepared an army

99
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,420
for him?

100
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,100
How dare you!

101
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,300
Your Majesty,

102
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,420
you know me.

103
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,380
I am

104
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,180
stubborn.

105
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,940
For sixteen years,

106
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,420
I did one thing.

107
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,220
Your Majesty,

108
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,580
please guess

109
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,980
if I succeeded this time.

110
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,860
Xiaoren,

111
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,420
are we not leaving?

112
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,820
You left me on the street.

113
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,420
I didn't know where to go,

114
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,460
so I came back.

115
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,060
I forgot about you.

116
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,060
Xiaoren,

117
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,820
I thought you had left me.

118
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,140
Sorry.

119
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,980
It's complicated.

120
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,420
I'll explain later.

121
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,500
Where's Zhu Dabao?

122
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,420
Wasn't he with you?

123
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,020
My Lordy, you jest.

124
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,460
How could he be with me?

125
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,820
Dabao is a good man

126
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,180
with a good family.

127
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,780
It's rare he likes you.

128
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,100
My Lord,

129
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,540
for this life,

130
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,620
being with my sister

131
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,700
is enough for me.

132
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,580
I don't seek

133
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,860
romance.

134
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,020
I don't like it.

135
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,660
Alright. I'll take you back.

136
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,020
We'll talk later.

137
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,540
Mo Wei.

138
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,460
You'll help me

139
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,540
kill Jun Mo, right?

140
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,260
Your Majesty.

141
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,860
General Mo.

142
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,740
Your Majesty.

143
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,140
You...

144
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,660
General Mo.

145
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,580
You are

146
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,020
my only support now.

147
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,540
I dare not.

148
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,260
General Mo,

149
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,020
can you bear to let me die

150
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,860
at Zhao Li's hands?

151
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,980
I will

152
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,900
do anything for you.

153
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,340
I'll sweep away

154
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,540
all obstacles

155
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,860
for you.

156
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,260
Yes.

157
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,020
If this succeeds,

158
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,340
you can spend your life with me.

159
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,140
I'm honored

160
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,700
to be in your service again.

161
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,900
This is worth dying for.

162
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,300
Xiaoren, are you and Mr. Jun Mo...?

163
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,550
Shh.

164
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,860
We've known each other for a long time.

165
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,420
He is the Seventh Prince,

166
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,460
just kept under house arrest here.

167
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,500
He is the Seventh Prince?

168
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,700
Then who are you?

169
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,780
My father used to be an official.

170
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,500
He was neglected as a child

171
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,060
and apprenticed under my father.

172
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,260
We grew up together.

173
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,940
Then Jun Mo must not be killed.

174
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,420
Of course not.

175
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,860
Now,

176
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,660
we just wait for Mo Wei to return.

177
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,380
After I avenge my father's death,

178
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,300
I'll leave.

179
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,940
Will Mr. Jun Mo

180
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,260
come with us?

181
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,020
After all, he is the Seventh Prince.

182
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,700
Even if he is neglected,

183
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,300
he wouldn't wander the martial world

184
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,420
with us.

185
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,180
(That's right.)

186
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,980
(He is the Seventh Prince.)

187
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,300
(And I)

188
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,220
(am just an assassin,)

189
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,460
(a daughter of a criminal in their eyes.)

190
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,500
Yao,

191
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,700
you're back.

192
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,900
What's wrong?

193
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,220
Nothing.

194
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,740
Will Mo Wei really come back?

195
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,540
I've already sent a message to him.

196
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,980
You were there back then.

197
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,740
You saw him kill my father.

198
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,060
Why are you with him now?

199
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,740
You finally asked.

200
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,820
Tell me.

201
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,460
I know he killed Master.

202
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,220
But I stayed with him

203
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,780
because

204
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,380
I wanted to find you

205
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,380
and kill him in front of you.

206
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,180
And now?

207
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,380
Now you don't want to kill him?

208
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,660
No.

209
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,860
Yao, let me explain.

210
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,380
I don't need your explanation.

211
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,180
You are a prince.

212
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,060
I am the daughter of a criminal.

213
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,460
Mo Wei must die by my hands.

214
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,540
If you stop me,

215
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,340
one of us

216
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,380
must die.
