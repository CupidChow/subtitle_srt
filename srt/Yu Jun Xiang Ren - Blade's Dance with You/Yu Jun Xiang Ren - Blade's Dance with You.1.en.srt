Master.

18
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,100
Master, please stop.

19
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,420
If you continue,

20
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,820
many people will die.

21
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,820
Father,

22
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,060
I will definitely avenge you.

23
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:16,900
Master.

24
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,380
Don't come over.

Yao died

(General Chain from Twelve Generals)

00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,900
(Zhao Xiaoren, Earth Killer from Flash Sect)

32
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,380
Where are the other two people?

33
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,340
I won't say anything.

34
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,580
Then don't speak.

35
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,300
(Father,)

36
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,460
(I will soon send these two down)

37
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,660
(to see you.)

38
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,020
So cute.

39
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,620
What a pity.

40
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,540
Come here. Come.

41
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,220
(Serene)

42
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,340
The winding path, misty marshes.

43
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,400
Step by step ascending gracefully.

44
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,460
In dreams, there should be

45
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,420
smiles as radiant as flowers.

46
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,220
Bright eyes and beautiful brows.

47
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,060
Good.

48
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,340
Bring another pot.

49
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,820
You're still in the mood to recite poetry.

50
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,620
Aren't you going

51
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,980
to marry the ugliest woman

52
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,820
in the entire capital city

53
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,050
and spend your wedding night with her?

54
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,780
If it were me, I definitely couldn't stand it.

55
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,980
But it doesn't matter.

56
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,420
Today, I specially brought

57
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,420
the top courtesan Fuxiang to serve you

58
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,580
to please you before your marriage.

59
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,500
My Lord,

60
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,180
how can such a joyful day

61
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,980
be celebrated with a cup?

62
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,020
Let's use a pot instead.

63
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,020
You can't.

64
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,650
You just arrived here.

65
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,820
If you finish a whole pot now,

66
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,300
I'll have to carry you home.

67
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,140
Let go.

68
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,260
No.

69
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,100
No.

70
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,980
Bravo.

71
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,300
Impressive.

72
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,980
Great.

73
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,900
Great.

74
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,340
What's going on here?

75
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,660
Someone's been killed.

76
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,300
Someone's been killed.

77
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,860
(Aside from Flash Sect,)

78
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,060
(someone else wants to kill him.)

79
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,900
(How many bad things has he done?)

80
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,580
What's this all about?

81
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,660
They were just decoys.

82
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,780
You're the real killer.

83
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,780
They're not worthy of teaming up with me.

84
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,980
Still defiant.

85
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,460
Let me see who you are.

86
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,620
This way,

87
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,260
you can't use hidden weapons anymore.

88
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,220
Shameless.

89
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,900
Surviving

90
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,580
isn't shameful.

91
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,460
Then don't blame me.

92
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,060
- What are you doing?
- Let me go!

93
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,590
Or I'll bite your ear off.

94
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,700
How dare you?

95
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,820
Try me.

96
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:52,990
Count to three. Let's let go together.

97
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,100
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

98
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,220
(Father's jade pendant.)

99
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,020
Why didn't you

100
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,060
catch her?

101
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,180
Let's go home.

102
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,700
Why is your ear so red?

103
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,300
Wait for me.

104
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,140
(Jasmine Villa)

105
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,340
(Three days later)

106
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,580
All the guests have left.

107
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,980
Stop standing here.

108
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,160
It's time to enter the bridal chamber.

109
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,460
Right.

110
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,500
Whether

111
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,520
the bride

112
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,460
is beautiful or ugly,

113
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,110
just

114
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,420
put this on.

115
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,660
Get lost.

116
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,060
Yes, My Lord.

117
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,100
It's getting late.

118
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,300
You should rest.

119
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,220
You can't

120
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,420
stand here all night.

121
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,500
I'm waiting for someone.

122
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,500
It's so late.

123
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,340
No one will come.

124
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,420
He's already arrived.

125
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,780
Jun Mo.

126
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,620
Congratulations.

127
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,660
On this auspicious day,

128
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,020
let me join the celebration.

129
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,620
Thank you.

130
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,460
Where's the bride?

131
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,820
Let me see her.

132
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,300
Your Highness,

133
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,300
today is Mr. Jun Mo's big day.

134
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,580
Disturbing the bride

135
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,860
would be against the etiquette.

136
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,420
Who are you to stop me?

137
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,780
Get lost.

138
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,700
It's okay.

139
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,660
This ceremony

140
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,180
was all prepared by my brother.

141
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,460
You're reasonable.

142
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,460
Did you hear?

143
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,980
Lu Zuo's daughter

144
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,300
is naturally extremely ugly.

145
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,220
She's over twenty years old now

146
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,620
and no one dares to propose to her.

147
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,020
Unexpectedly,

148
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,380
you're in luck.

149
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,460
My dad said,

150
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,900
"An ugly wife is a treasure at home."

151
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,380
My mom is ugly.

152
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,340
What's your name?

153
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,460
Zhu Dabao.

154
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,660
Zhu Dabao?

155
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,420
Indeed a pig.

156
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,420
Want to get promoted and rich?

157
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,620
- Yes.
- Yes?

158
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,460
Guards,

159
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,580
castrate this fat pig

160
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,740
and send him to the palace to serve me.

161
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,700
- Jun Mo.
- Your Highness.

162
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,380
Didn't you want to see the bride?

163
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,420
Let's go.

164
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,100
Consider yourself spared this time.

165
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,220
Next time you dare to interrupt,

166
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,220
I'll castrate your entire family.

167
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,060
(Happy)

168
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,540
Jun Mo,

169
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,500
she's a criminal's daughter.

170
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,980
Now that you've married her,

171
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,460
behave yourself

172
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,020
and stay here for the rest of your life.

173
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,900
It should be so.

174
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,460
You've always been like this.

175
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,020
I can't tell if you're angry or happy.

176
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,660
Good.

177
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,500
Then look at her.

178
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,220
