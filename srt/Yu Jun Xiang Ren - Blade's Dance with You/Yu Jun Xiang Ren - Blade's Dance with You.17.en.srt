You're the Poison Queen?

18
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,460
Why? Do you look down on me?

19
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,270
She didn't mean it like that.

20
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,080
She's just a little startled

21
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,960
by your youth and beauty.

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,610
Indeed friends of Li Wei.

23
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,120
Why did you put insect repellent powder

24
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,050
on your face?

25
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,390
Right.

26
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,760
I'm his sister.

27
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,900
She's Zhao Xiaoren.

28
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,610
You're Zhao Xiaoren?

29
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,480
You know me?

30
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,120
Don't know. Leave now.

31
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,050
Wait!

32
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,510
Poison Queen,

33
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,510
my husband has been poisoned
by the Seven Deadly.

34
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,150
Please help him.

35
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,180
(Have you become her husband?)

36
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,360
The Seven Deadly is colorless and odorless.

37
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,370
He'll die at the seventh 15 minutes
after the seventh step.

38
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,210
There's no antidote.

39
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,680
Impossible!

40
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,550
He's been poisoned for two days

41
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,570
and hasn't died yet.

42
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,210
Two days?

43
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,770
Impossible.

44
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,570
He should have died already.

45
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,720
He practiced martial arts from Tuluo Sect

46
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,570
and used cold water to drive away the poison.

47
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,550
What Tuluo Sect?

48
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,650
Never heard of it.

49
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,570
But he's not detoxing now.

50
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,270
He's using the cold qi of ice

51
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,070
to force the poison to a place.

52
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,680
If I were there,

53
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,120
within 15 minutes after being poisoned,

54
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,290
I could still help him.

55
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:37,910
Now,

56
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,150
he can only wait for the poison to kill him.

57
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,820
At most, not more than seven days.

58
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,820
No.

59
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,570
You're lying to me.

60
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,370
Don't worry.

61
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,010
You'll die before him.

62
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,930
You touched my clothes.

63
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,480
Go wait for Li Wei at death's door.

64
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,560
Consider it my gift to him.

65
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,910
Kill her if you want.

66
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,290
Why poison Li Wei?

67
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,910
Isn't he her husband?

68
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,420
Her husband is Jun Mo.

69
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,110
Isn't she Zhao Xiaoren?

70
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,510
Li Wei's favorite woman.

71
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,960
Li Wei does like her.

72
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,460
But she married Jun Mo.

73
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,010
Oh.

74
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,370
Give this to her.

75
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,430
Follow me.

76
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,300
Will I get poisoned if I touch her?

77
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,210
No.

78
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,320
Didn't expect

79
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,370
the Poison Queen's place to be so nice.

80
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,370
Using this on your face will heal you faster.

81
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,520
On my face?

82
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,460
See for yourself.

83
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,460
Please save my husband.

84
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,770
There is a way,

85
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,620
but you have to die.

86
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,680
As long as it can save him,

87
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,980
I can die.

88
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,260
Really?

89
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,680
Yes.

90
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,520
Good.

91
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,920
I'm sure you know

92
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,280
the Chief has a Dragon Pill

93
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,370
in the Forbidden Area.

94
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,160
Li Wei told me

95
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,230
only you know

96
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,740
how to enter the Forbidden Area.

97
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,580
So I came to ask you.

98
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,420
Wait.

99
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,640
The Forbidden Area is surrounded

100
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,440
by poison gas

101
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,980
that can seep through the skin

102
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,170
and cause hallucinations.

103
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,650
Within less than fifteen minutes,

104
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,820
the person will decay and die.

105
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,160
This pill

106
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,480
can keep you alive.

107
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,400
But

108
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,260
if you leave the poison gas area,

109
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,300
you'll die even worse.

110
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,370
So, you have to think it over.

111
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,420
Where's the pill?

112
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,540
She ate it.

113
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,200
I said so much

114
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
to make you think it over

115
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,580
and then give up.

116
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,980
No need to think.

117
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,050
Let's go.

118
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,450
Okay.

119
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,820
Wait here for me.

120
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,920
Do you want to reconsider?

121
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,920
I've taken the pill already.

122
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,050
What else is there to consider?

123
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,890
Has she gone in?

124
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,880
Three meters away.

125
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,820
Scared?

126
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,720
What are you afraid of?

127
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,210
I won't poison you.

128
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,470
You two.

129
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,790
One kills from three meters away.

130
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,110
The other from within three meters.

131
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,260
You're both monsters.

132
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,230
She's a monster with feelings.

133
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,210
I'm not.

134
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,650
Be careful.

135
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,860
Father.

136
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,490
Jun Mo.

137
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,210
Jun Mo.

138
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,110
In Chunhua Pavilion,

139
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,610
were you there to kill me?

140
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,230
You posed as Lu Zuo's daughter

141
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,490
to kill me.

142
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,930
Jun Mo.

143
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,880
What made you change your mind?

144
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,720
Say it.

145
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:58,860
Say it.

146
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,610
Jun Mo.

147
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,300
Jun Mo.

148
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,070
This is an illusion.

149
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,450
I'm already poisoned.

150
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,120
If I can't get out,

151
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,580
I'll die here.

152
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,300
"Our union doth shine brighter than gold;

153
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,650
our bond shall endure 'til the end of days."

154
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,080
Yao.

155
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,500
Ran.

156
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,810
Don't leave me again.

157
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,180
Is she dead inside?

158
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,810
My pill can only keep her body safe.

159
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,380
If she can't get out of the illusion,

160
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,890
she'll be trapped forever.

161
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,420
(Almost fell into it.)

162
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,620
