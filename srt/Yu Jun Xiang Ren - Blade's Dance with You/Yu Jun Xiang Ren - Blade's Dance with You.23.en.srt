16
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,300
Poison Queen, we've arrived.

17
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,370
No visitors today.

18
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,830
Step on my territory

19
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:11,670
and die.

20
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:15,800
Let me.

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,470
I'm here too.

22
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,790
Li Wei, you're here too.

23
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,640
Poison Queen, let us in.

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,910
Come, come.

25
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:31,750
Sit quickly.

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,180
Sit down.

27
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,460
Is there something between you two?

28
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,430
Of course, there is.

29
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,800
In the Underground Palace,

30
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,750
she is my best friend.

31
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,010
Aren't I your best friend?

32
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,970
You're my sister.

33
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,210
Poison Queen,

34
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,390
look what I brought you.

35
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,600
Delicious food. It must be delicious.

36
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,970
Roast chicken from Tianxiang Tower.

37
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,960
Roast chicken?

38
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,760
Trotters from Juyuan House.

39
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,510
Smells good.

40
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,100
And smoked fish from Zhenwei Restaurant.

41
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,580
Wow.

42
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,660
When did you get

43
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,120
all these delicacies?

44
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,410
Knowing I was coming to see you,

45
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,080
I lined up before dawn.

46
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,550
Li Wei, you are so good to me.

47
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,970
It's nothing.

48
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,510
And

49
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,680
this.

50
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,710
Liquor from Maoxian Town.

51
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,950
Great.

52
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,870
Give it to me.

53
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,890
Where did you pull that out from?

54
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,590
Get lost.

55
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,600
So delicious.

56
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,280
Poison Queen,

57
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,340
I'm here to find my wife.

58
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,260
Zhao Xiaoren, right?

59
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,600
Exactly.

60
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,750
She has poor taste.

61
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,430
How could she fancy you?

62
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,080
Poison Queen,

63
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,600
if he's not good enough,

64
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,510
then who is?

65
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,080
Isn't it obvious?

66
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,160
I think Li Wei is much better than him.

67
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,600
That's because you like him.

68
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,080
Don't waste food.

69
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,010
Oh.

70
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,040
Where exactly is Zhao Xiaoren?

71
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,410
How would I know?

72
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,680
The Underground Palace is huge.

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,050
What about the Empress?

74
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,040
What Empress?

75
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,830
Shouldn't the Empress be in the Palace?

76
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,670
Poison Queen,

77
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,300
the Empress is actually the Chief.

78
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,550
She's here with me.

79
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,870
What are you doing?

80
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,080
Planning to kill someone here?

81
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,370
We're not here to kill anyone.

82
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,660
She's here to kill us.

83
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,910
She won't. She's been detoxifying.

84
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,680
She can't use her inner strength
for three days.

85
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,100
Then where is she now?

86
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,800
Poison Queen,

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,040
where is she?

88
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,000
Come on. I'll take you.

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,890
- Wait.
- Okay.

90
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,330
Ask

91
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,640
about my wife too.

92
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,640
Where is Zhao Xiaoren?

93
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,080
Well,

94
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,510
I truly don't know.

95
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,970
So hungry.

96
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,010
They're here to rescue you.

97
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,200
The secret passage below

98
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,600
has been sealed.

99
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,800
To get in,

100
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,600
they must pass through the poison mist.

101
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,710
You've been here so long.

102
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,040
Aren't you bored?

103
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,830
I'll stay here with you,

104
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,100
until you die.

105
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,380
Or,

106
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,620
until the Empress orders me

107
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,640
to release you.

108
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,330
You'll get through the poison mist

109
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,260
alone.

110
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,600
What about you?

111
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,760
I'll die here.

112
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,600
Poison Queen, you broke your promise.

113
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,760
No, I didn't.

114
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,370
You promised

115
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,750
to keep me safe.

116
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,800
Yes, they won't harm you.

117
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,910
I just want to take Yao.

118
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,160
I don't care about your life.

119
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,050
Where is she?

120
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,600
Jun Mo, you disappoint me.

121
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,870
I didn't expect you to value love so much.

122
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,540
You should've killed me without hesitation

123
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,410
and gone back to be a good Emperor.

124
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,220
That's what you should've done.

125
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,200
Your so-called grand principles

126
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,460
don't work on me.

127
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,870
I've respected you all these years

128
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,290
because my mother once told me

129
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,460
you saved her.

130
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,600
But don't touch Yao.

131
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,680
Then let me tell you.

132
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,460
Zhao Xiaoren is somewhere

133
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,500
with no food

134
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,640
or water.

135
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,950
Only I can release her.

136
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,180
What will you do?

137
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,620
I will do whatever you want.

138
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,010
Including killing them?

139
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,890
Dream on.

140
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,390
Jun Mo won't kill the innocent.

141
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,850
Shall I kill him first?

142
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,470
How dare you.

143
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,220
I started to kill at nine years old,

144
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,430
and it was my father's wife.

145
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,040
If you make him kill Li Wei,

146
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,580
I guarantee no one in the Underground Palace

147
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,890
will survive,

148
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,680
including you.

149
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,510
So the man you want is him?

150
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,710
Don't reveal my secret,

151
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,050
or I'll poison you mute.

152
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,430
You like me?

153
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,410
No, no.

154
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,510
Don't listen to her nonsense.

155
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,790
Jun Mo,

156
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,790
you're not as righteous

157
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,430
as you claim.

158
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,830
If you can't kill Li Wei,

159
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,600
kill that annoying woman.

160
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,140
Jun Mo,

161
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,220
you won't kill me, right?

162
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,470
I will,

163
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,460
but before killing you,

164
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,750
I'll kill him first.

165
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,260
Why kill me?

166
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,370
You can make me do anything I don't want to,

167
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,350
but first,

168
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,210
I'll kill Li Wei.

169
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,100
Jun Mo,

170
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,960
what did I do to offend you?

171
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,080
Smart move.

172
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,850
Understanding the balance of power.

173
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,090
Rest assured,

174
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,660
Jun Mo won't kill us.

175
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,460
He's using your relationship
with the Poison Queen

176
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,510
to balance against the Empress.

177
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,760
She's already in her sixties.

178
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,120
I need your help

179
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,640
to ascend the throne.

180
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,180
Alright.

181
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,080
But I have one condition.

182
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,600
To kill me first, right?

183
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,300
Release Yao first.

184
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,300
Alright.

185
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,970
I agree.

186
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,640
How did you meet the Empress?

187
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,700
Why willingly be her puppet

188
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,680
and help her kill?

189
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,300
I won't leave anyway,

190
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,050
so I'll show you who I am.

191
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,100
General Archer?

192
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,800
Yes.

193
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,050
It's me.

194
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,850
Why unconditionally help the Empress kill?

195
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,850
Once some things are done,

196
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,800
there's no turning back.

197
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,850
Moreover, she kept her promise.

198
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,760
What did she promise you?

199
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,750
She promised to make the Liang State strong,

200
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,850
so the border people are no longer

201
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,710
harassed by invaders.

202
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,680
She did it.

203
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,470
She did it?

204
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,000
Jun Mo,

205
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,760
stop moving forward.

206
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,910
Sanmu, release her.

207
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,220
She really wants me to release you.

208
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,290
How do you know it's the Empress,

209
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,550
and not someone else?

210
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,130
Only she

211
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,890
knows I'm called Sanmu.

212
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,300
Yao.

213
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,430
Jun Mo.

214
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,540
Come here.

215
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,380
Yao.

216
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,050
Jun Mo.

217
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:22,980
Yao.

218
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,640
Are you even human?

219
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,290
To trap me,

220
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,000
you let someone who followed you
for over ten years

221
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,430
starve to death there.

222
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,430
Jun Mo,

223
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,260
it's time to fulfill your promise.

224
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,220
What did you promise her?

225
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,890
I promised her

226
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,510
to help her ascend the throne.

227
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,800
