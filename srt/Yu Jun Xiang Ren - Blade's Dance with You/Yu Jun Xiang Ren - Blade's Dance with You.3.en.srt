16
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,660
Why did I sleep so soundly?

17
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:30,750
Who are you?

18
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,950
My Lord, let me help you change clothes.

19
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,700
If you don't speak, I'll take action.

20
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,000
My Lord, you're hurting me.

21
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,830
I'm your wife's sister.

22
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,750
I underestimated her.

23
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,200
My sister does morning exercises.

24
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,000
She should be back soon.

25
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,950
Look, she's back now.

26
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,990
Did you bring her here?

27
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,570
Forgot to tell you.

28
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,070
She's my cousin, Chen Yuan.

29
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,650
You're a fake.

30
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,740
Even brought a fake cousin.

31
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,660
Want to die?

32
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:14,860
You...

33
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,070
He hurt me just now.

34
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,530
Why are you so rude?

35
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,320
I rescued her on the way.

36
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,120
Get out.

37
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,860
What are you doing?

38
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,950
What am I doing?

39
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,320
Looks like you forgot our agreement

40
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,360
from yesterday.

41
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,400
I didn't forget.

42
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,580
You didn't?

43
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,110
I said

44
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,150
don't go out at will.

45
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,490
I didn't go out at will.

46
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,650
I just brought someone

47
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,570
back.

48
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,170
If you do it again,

49
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,200
I'll kick you out of the villa.

50
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,400
Don't intimidate me.

51
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,110
Don't forget my identity.

52
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,530
If you continue to disrespect me,

53
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,110
I might spread rumors about you.

54
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,820
Yesterday, you begged me

55
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,070
to let you stay in the villa.

56
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,740
Rest assured.

57
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,200
She knows nothing about us.

58
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,040
That's right.

59
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,530
I was too naive,

60
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,450
thinking about setting three rules with you.

61
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,820
Even if there are three hundred rules,

62
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,150
you wouldn't follow even one.

63
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,450
Don't push it

64
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,490
and ruin my reputation.

65
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,070
Go ask around in the martial world.

66
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,570
Zhao Xiaoren has always been decisive.

67
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,950
You're Zhao Xiaoren?

68
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,790
What's wrong?

69
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,740
- Heard of my reputation?
- No.

70
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,990
Then why are you surprised?

71
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,280
I'm just curious

72
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,450
what kind of father

73
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,490
would give his daughter

74
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,650
such an offensive name.

75
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,280
Don't speak ill of my father.

76
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,740
I chose this name myself.

77
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,030
It means the blade for avenging enemies.

78
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,070
Who are you seeking revenge on?

79
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,570
Why should I tell you?

80
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,490
Truly uncultured.

81
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,900
Say that again.

82
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,070
I'm stating facts.

83
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,020
Whose daughter acts like you?

84
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,070
Shut up!

85
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,400
I'll bite you to death.

86
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,650
- Still saying it?
- Let go!

87
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,800
Xiaoren!

88
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,280
Xiaoren, what's going on?

89
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,280
We're playing around.

90
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,040
Xiaoren, you bit him!

91
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,950
This is wrong of you.

92
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,620
He is your husband after all.

93
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,290
You should always respect and love him.

94
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,130
What are you looking at?

95
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,400
Stop it or I'll gouge your eyes out.

96
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,200
Let's not argue today.

97
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,290
It's late.

98
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,410
Let's meet Mr. Mo, the owner here.

99
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,720
What about me?

100
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,040
Stay in the room. Don't come out.

101
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,620
(Steady and Sustained)

102
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,740
Master, Mr. and Mrs. Jun are here.

103
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:03,970
Let them in.

104
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,300
My Lord.

105
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,820
My Lady.

106
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,060
Father!

107
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,940
Zhao Xiaoren!

108
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,660
Zhao Xiaoren!

109
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,780
Zhao Xiaoren!

110
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,380
My Lord, this is...

111
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,220
Fetch a Doctor.

112
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,580
Xiaoren.

113
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,300
Didn't I tell you not to wander?

114
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,380
What's wrong with her?

115
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,460
She's overwhelmed by her emotions.

116
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,620
She needs rest.

117
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,500
She just went to see the master

118
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,580
with you.

119
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,500
How did it turn out like this?

120
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,860
Zhao Xiaoren!

121
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,940
(Why did she act like this)

122
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,780
(after seeing Mo Wei?)

123
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,380
I'll leave for a while.

124
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,340
Stay here.

125
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,180
Master,

126
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,220
we've found out.

127
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,420
Tell me.

128
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,060
Mr. Jun Mo's wife

129
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,700
is indeed not Lu Zuo's daughter.

130
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,940
As I expected.

131
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,220
What's the relationship

132
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,060
between Mr. Jun Mo and Zhao Xiaoren?

133
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,180
We need to continue investigating.

134
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,580
Investigate thoroughly.

135
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,180
- Go.
- Yes.

136
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,420
Your Highness.

137
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,660
Do you have a grudge against Zhao Xiaoren?

138
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,580
You also know she's not Lu Zuo's daughter.

139
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,180
I was just told

140
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,180
Lu Zuo's daughter had been replaced.

141
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,220
Why do you think I kept her?

142
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,220
I don't know.

143
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,500
Because she belongs to Father,

144
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,380
holding

145
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,860
his personal token.

146
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,540
It's His Majesty.

147
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,060
He wants you dead.

148
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,540
Your Highness,

149
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,980
you can't back down now.

150
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,100
I've known your tricks long ago.

151
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,540
So have Father and the Queen.

152
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,940
I've always been loyal to you, Your Highness.

153
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,580
I couldn't have hidden anything from you.

154
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,020
You've taken care of me for ten years,

155
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,940
but it doesn't mean you can do as you please.

156
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,580
You being alive

157
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,100
isn't out of my mercy.

158
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,380
I'll let Yao watch me kill you

159
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,740
after I find her

160
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,900
to avenge Master.

161
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,580
I deserve it.

162
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,620
I will die for my crimes,

163
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,460
but I must

164
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,700
help you ascend the throne

165
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,940
to atone for the heinous crimes

166
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,580
I committed back then.

167
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,500
You already know

168
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,740
my stance.

169
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,540
Take care of yourself.

170
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,300
My Lord.

171
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,220
Go back now.

172
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,720
I'm not tired.

173
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,460
I'm very tired,

174
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,700
so don't make me

175
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,340
say it again.

176
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,500
Father!

177
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,620
Father!

178
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,540
Father!

179
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,420
Father, don't leave me.

180
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,220
(Indeed.)

181
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,220
(She wants to avenge her dad.)

182
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,660
(Is Mo Wei)

183
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,540
(her enemy?)

184
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,020
Father.

185
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,180
I don't have a daughter like you.

186
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,660
Why is it you?

187
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,380
Who else could it be?

188
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,820
What are you here for?

189
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,220
The doctor said your liver fire is excessive.

190
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,900
This is a specially made calming soup.

191
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,340
Drink it and you'll feel better tomorrow.

192
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,780
Are you really this kind-hearted?

193
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,300
Your father

194
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,260
was killed by Mo Wei?

195
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,900
(How much has he figured out?)

196
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,580
But you can't kill him.

197
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,020
You won't be able to kill him.

198
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,340
I don't even know him.

199
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,140
I spat blood earlier

200
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,020
because of an internal injury.

201
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,540
I couldn't hold it in.

202
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,700
I see.

203
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,340
I guess I was overthinking.

204
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,340
I was even considering

205
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,820
sending Mo Wei away

206
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,860
from the villa.

207
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,940
There's no need for that.

208
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,980
Tomorrow, I will explain everything

209
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,900
to Mr. Mo.

210
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,060
If that's the case,

211
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,900
drink the medicine now.

212
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,620
(Is he poisoning me?)

213
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,660
(Could he be trying to kill me with poison?)

214
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,500
(What is she looking at?)

215
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,780
(Is she waiting for me to feed her?)

216
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,460
(Should I drink it or not?)

217
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,580
(Does she think it's poisoned?)

218
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,700
(I'll drink it.)

219
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,540
(Even if it's poison, I must drink it.)

220
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,660
(She's really waiting)

221
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,860
(for me to feed her.)

222
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,500
(Come on.)

223
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,340
Wait.

224
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,220
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

225
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,860
It's too hot. I couldn't hold it.

226
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,820
Drink it yourself.

227
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,380
(Zhao Li,)

228
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,220
(you never expected)

229
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,020
(that I would be the one)

230
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,020
(to fulfill)

231
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,460
(your last wish.)

232
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,060
So bitter.

233
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,620
(Yao was also afraid of bitterness as a child.)

234
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,300
Open your mouth.

235
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,340
Let go.

236
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:06,900
How dare you bite me?

237
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,060
Let go.

238
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,420
Just joking.

239
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,620
So dirty.

240
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,260
You should go wash up.

241
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,220
I just spat all over you.

242
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,460
Smells terrible.

243
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,980
I was planning to do that.

244
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,100
Go, quickly.

245
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,460
Don't mind me. Go.

246
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,460
Xiaoren,

247
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,580
why are you here?

248
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,700
Where are my things?

249
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,660
They're all here.

250
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,780
Xiaoren, what are you going to do?

251
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,180
To kill someone.

252
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,180
Your murderous intent

253
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,220
