16
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,500
Then look at her.

17
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,700
See if you can smile or not.

18
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,410
(Who is she?)

19
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,370
Who are you?

20
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,540
You're not Lu Zuo's daughter.

21
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,750
Don't worry. I'm here to save you.

22
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,700
Please help me.

23
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,500
I don't want to marry that person.

24
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,700
I already have someone else.

25
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,580
Your beloved must love you very much.

26
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,370
Let me help you elope with him.

27
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,540
What are you doing?

28
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,710
Get lost.

29
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,830
Lu Zuo's daughter is extremely ugly.

30
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,700
She is not Lu Zuo's daughter.

31
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,000
Lu Zuo is handsome

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,120
and tall.

33
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,410
How could his daughter be an ugly freak?

34
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,080
Rumors are all unreliable.

35
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,660
Then why has Lu Zuo never

36
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,790
denied the rumors?

37
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,040
Only she can answer that.

38
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,870
In fact, I didn't want to marry

39
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,160
so my father

40
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,450
made up this rumor for me.

41
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,540
Why?

42
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,750
Because

43
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,790
I've been weak and sickly since childhood

44
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,200
and won't survive another year or two.

45
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,450
This beauty's origin is suspicious.

46
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,580
I'll take her back first

47
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,700
and interrogate her.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,160
- Let's go.
- Your Highness.

49
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:23,630
Let go.

50
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,700
Do you want everyone to know

51
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,450
that you took my wife

52
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,750
on our wedding night?

53
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,590
Lower your voice.

54
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,420
Let go.

55
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,200
Do you think I care about it?

56
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,750
Am I wrong?

57
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,210
Fine.

58
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,700
I'll let you off today.

59
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,290
Looks like

60
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,160
the Crown Prince lost this round.

61
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,120
Why impersonate Lu Zuo's daughter?

62
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,290
Because I want your life.

63
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,330
(I can't beat him.)

64
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,540
You're not good enough.

65
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,950
So, it's you.

66
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,450
You recognized me so quickly.

67
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,370
Who sent you?

68
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,660
I won't tell you.

69
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,000
Just kill me.

70
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,370
Kill you?

71
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,330
That'd be too easy on you.

72
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,370
What do you want?

73
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,080
I'll do whatever I want.

74
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,920
What do you want?

75
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,330
Before impersonating the bride,

76
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,250
you should have expected

77
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,200
ten thousand possibilities.

78
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,500
Stop it.

79
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,290
Can't take this anymore?

80
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,250
If you don't kill me today,

81
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,160
I'll kill you in the future.

82
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,830
I've seen many killers

83
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,200
but a chaste woman like you,

84
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,660
this is the first time.

85
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,500
Tell me.

86
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,910
Who sent you?

87
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,620
I won't tell you.

88
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,590
(It's Father.)

89
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,620
(Li Wei gave me his token.)

90
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,790
Seeing the token is like seeing the Leader.

91
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,250
Leader?

92
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,700
This is handed to me by the Leader.

93
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,330
I am the special envoy of the Leader.

94
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,410
Now do you know who I am?

95
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,410
Why don't you let me go?

96
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,620
What are you doing?

97
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,410
You've brought so many items

98
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,290
as your dowry.

99
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,750
Still want to deceive me?

100
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,500
The token is here.

101
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,950
How can I deceive you?

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,370
Are you saying

103
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,330
Lu Zuo's daughter

104
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,000
is not an ugly freak,

105
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,700
but actually quite beautiful?

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,330
Not just beautiful,

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,700
even somewhat charming.

108
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,040
Something's fishy about this.

109
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,450
Dare to play tricks

110
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,580
right under my nose?

111
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,290
Jun Mo is getting

112
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,580
brazen.

113
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,540
Exactly.

114
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,700
Mother, how about...

115
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,200
They just made you like a fool.

116
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,540
Isn't that embarrassing enough?

117
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,660
- Mother, I
- Go back to your mansion.

118
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,870
Without my order,

119
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,330
you're not allowed to provoke him.

120
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,960
Yes.

121
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,910
Investigate Jun Mo's bride.

122
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,500
Yes.

123
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,000
Jun Mo,

124
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,080
if you don't die,

125
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,750
there will always be a thorn

126
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,290
in my heart.

127
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,120
He sent you to kill me?

128
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,700
So what?

129
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,790
(Li Wei didn't lie to me.)

130
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,290
(There really is a leader
in the martial world.)

131
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,370
If it's really him,

132
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,870
then go ahead.

133
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,080
(Why does he have Father's jade pendant?)

134
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,200
(Is he related to Father's death?)

135
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,000
I advise you to return it to me.

136
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,290
Why so nervous?

137
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,040
Just a jade pendant.

138
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,540
Before I die,

139
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,080
no one can take it from me.

140
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,410
The Leader doesn't necessarily

141
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,500
have to kill you.

142
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,540
Just wants to see

143
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,620
if you have any second thoughts

144
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,330
and if you follow his instructions.

145
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,330
I've been exiled to this villa

146
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,830
for life.

147
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,120
What else do you want from me?

148
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,870
Does he really want me dead?

149
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,250
You don't have to die,

150
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,450
but you were disrespectful to me

151
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,500
and should be punished.

152
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,410
Why didn't you

153
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,500
clarify your identity earlier?

154
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,200
I'm a secret envoy.

155
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,700
Would I still be secret if I told you?

156
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,450
What exactly do you want?

157
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,330
I want one of your hands.

158
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,290
This one.

159
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,450
Okay.

160
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,450
(If I chop down,)

161
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,750
(it might be me who dies.)

162
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,130
Chop.

163
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,290
Why would I be so bold?

164
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,450
I knew you wouldn't dare.

165
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,500
What are you looking at?

166
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,040
A slap is not enough?

167
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,540
Seeking death.

168
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,750
Laifu.

169
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,450
Laifu, Laifu.

170
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,450
I can't breathe.

171
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,290
Your Highness.

172
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,500
Get up.

173
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,210
Get up.

174
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,500
Your Highness, be careful of your health.

175
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,750
Look up.

176
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,620
You're an eunuch.

177
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,750
How dare you plead with me?

178
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,250
For his sake,

179
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,330
I'll spare your life.

180
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,910
Get out now.

181
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,870
The mission is not complete.

182
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,750
I can't leave.

183
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,910
What else do you want?

184
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,830
I was exposed as soon as I arrived.

185
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,790
How can I report back to the Leader now?

186
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,370
He'll kill me.

187
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,410
What's it to me?

188
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,910
But come to think of it,

189
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,950
now you need me.

190
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,120
Are you threatening me?

191
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,250
Forget it.

192
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,870
Consider me begging you.

193
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,910
Let me stay here a few more days,

194
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,500
and when I go back,

195
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,750
I'll speak well of you to the Leader.

196
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,380
No need.

197
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,160
In this world,

198
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,450
he's the only one who has the right

199
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,620
to let us die.

200
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,080
(Why is this guy so conservative?)

201
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,200
Don't waste this good wine and food.

202
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,100
Wait.

203
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,980
Where's Lu Zuo's daughter?

204
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,420
Rest assured.

205
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,580
Your wife is already eloping

206
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,540
with her lover.

207
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,620
For the next few days, I'll be your wife.

208
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,820
Don't give yourself away.

209
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,780
(Her behavior is so strange.)

210
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,580
(Not like those around Father.)

211
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,820
(But why is she carrying Father's)

212
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,260
(personal token?)

213
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,820
Want to join me?

214
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,980
You can stay,

215
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,260
but I have rules.

216
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,460
What rules?

217
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,780
First,

218
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,380
you must act like a lady.

219
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,500
No lady eats like you do.

220
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,700
How am I not like a lady?

221
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,620
Second, no leaving the house at will,

222
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,220
and don't let anyone see you.

223
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,220
Isn't that like being in prison?

224
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:35,900
Third.

225
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,940
What's the third rule?

226
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,300
From now on, every night,

227
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,180
you'll sleep in the same room as me.

228
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,380
What do you want?

229
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,540
You just said it yourself.

230
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,860
Your current status

231
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,580
is my wife.

232
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,780
Okay.

233
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,060
I can sleep

234
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,300
with one eye open.

235
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,380
Let's sleep.

236
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,020
Let me down.

237
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,750
Why?

238
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,380
Who let you sleep in the bed?

239
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,260
Are you a man?

240
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,740
I'm a man,

241
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,340
but I don't treat you as a woman.

242
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,420
Can you at least give me a pillow?

243
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,420
Your Majesty, we've investigated thoroughly.

244
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,540
She's a fake bride.

245
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,980
And we found this.

246
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,660
