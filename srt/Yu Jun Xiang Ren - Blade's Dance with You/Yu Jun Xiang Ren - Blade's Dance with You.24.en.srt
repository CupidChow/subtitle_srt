18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,220
I'll come to see you.

19
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,550
It's this answer again.

20
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,420
My Lady,

21
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,540
please teach me

22
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,460
how to stay young

23
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,920
forever.

24
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,880
Zuo Xiachan, what are you doing?

25
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,500
Poison Queen

26
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,200
is already 68 years old.

27
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,960
Master, please accept me.

28
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,440
Do you think I did wrong?

29
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,920
If it was for me,

30
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,800
then it's a big mistake.

31
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,000
If not,

32
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,500
then you're foolish enough to believe

33
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,760
that a person who stops at nothing

34
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,000
to achieve their goals

35
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,200
can ensure peace for the people.

36
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,680
I think she can.

37
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,390
A blood-stained bun

38
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,440
can indeed fill the stomach,

39
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,500
but would you eat a bun stained

40
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,320
with your parents' blood?

41
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,340
Zhao Li.

42
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,700
After my death,

43
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,720
did the border wars cease?

44
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,260
Yes, yes. They ceased.

45
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,720
Then I can rest in peace.

46
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,320
Your Majesty, you had another nightmare.

47
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,420
Are you a human or a ghost?

48
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,360
Do you wish for my death so badly?

49
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,120
Jun Mo, are you alright?

50
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,240
Crown Princess, are you unharmed?

51
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,700
Acted all your life,

52
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,800
you can't stop acting now.

53
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,680
Ministry of Rites.

54
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,980
Here.

55
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,180
I want a decree drafted

56
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,680
to pass the throne to Crown Prince Jun Mo.

57
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:33,820
Yes.

58
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,670
Father,

59
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,490
you're not passing the throne to me

60
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,960
but to the Empress.

61
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,560
Impossible, absolutely impossible.

62
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,320
Letting you draft the decree

63
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,300
is to give you a chance to survive.

64
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,780
Otherwise, you'd be dead now.

65
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,420
I...

66
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,570
I've been weak and useless all my life,

67
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,520
always controlled by others.

68
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,680
At this point,

69
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,720
I will never pass the throne

70
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,360
to a woman.

71
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,430
How can I face

72
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,960
my ancestors?

73
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,500
- Jun Mo, protect me.
- Your Majesty.

74
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,120
I'll pass the throne to you.

75
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,800
Enough.

76
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,400
You want to go back on your word?

77
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,880
I'll help you fulfill that wish.

78
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,520
Put on this royal robe,

79
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,960
and you'll be the new ruler of this world.

80
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:14,100
(Funing Hall)

81
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,120
The weather is so nice today.

82
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,440
What did the Poison Queen give you?

83
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,600
Why is it more effective than mine?

84
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,460
I didn't use anything

85
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,760
from the Poison Queen.

86
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,380
I'm going to buy a roast suckling pig.

87
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,700
Going to see the Poison Queen,

88
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,540
I'm leaving now.

89
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,360
Looks like I need to find a partner too.

90
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,860
Wait. I'll go with you.

91
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,720
I want to get something from the Poison Queen.

92
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,020
The Empress seems foolish.

93
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,120
Not using inner strength
means she wouldn't die.

94
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,020
Did you know earlier

95
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,520
the Empress didn't want to live?

96
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,660
From the moment she said

97
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,080
she wanted me to help her ascend the throne,

98
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,720
I knew.

99
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,160
Why?

100
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,880
The Empress values power the most.

101
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,700
What keeps her going

102
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,080
is power.

103
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,520
But all her close relatives are dead.

104
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,160
So she knows

105
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,160
even if she can secretly control the court,

106
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,720
she can never sit on the throne.

107
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,900
So,

108
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,260
the Empress was asking you

109
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,120
to help fulfill her final wish.

110
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,020
Now that the Empress is dead,

111
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,520
what do you plan to do?

112
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,880
You know the answer.

113
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,360
Am I to become the new Empress?

114
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,620
Being the Empress isn't that easy.

115
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,200
It'll be easy for me.

116
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,600
Why?

117
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,180
Because I'll be the only one

118
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,520
in the harem.

119
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,980
If you dare marry again,

120
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,000
I'll kill them all.

121
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,840
Then I have to reconsider

122
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,420
being the Emperor.

123
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,520

124
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,560
