16
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,260
Zhao Xiaoren,

17
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,700
Flash Sect has issued a kill order against you.

18
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,620
Didn't expect you

19
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,260
to come here on your own.

20
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,220
Less talk.

21
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,820
I want to the Dragon Pill.

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,540
Let's see if you're capable.

23
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,540
Half the potency

24
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,940
is not enough to save his life.

25
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,290
You're out.

26
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,940
I only got half the pill.

27
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,020
Can it save Jun Mo's life?

28
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,740
I think so.

29
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,380
Go back to the Forbidden Area.
I'll find a way to save you.

30
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,020
No need.

31
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,700
I want to see him.

32
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,500
Zhao Xiaoren!

33
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,940
- Zhao Xiaoren!
- Zhao Xiaoren!

34
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,220
Zhao Xiaoren!

35
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,060
Zhao Xiaoren!

36
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,140
So many poisonous insects here.

37
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,820
How do you live here?

38
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,700
All the poisonous insects here are my sons.

39
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,260
Stepping on one will cost you your life.

40
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,100
No.

41
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,340
I haven't stepped on any.

42
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,040
What kind of snake bit her?

43
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,020
What snake could it be in that poisonous mist?

44
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,380
It must be a venomous snake.

45
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,180
Right.

46
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,540
Everything has its enemy.

47
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,340
There must be an antidote within seven steps.

48
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,980
I need to find a way to catch one

49
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,340
and study it.

50
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,360
Catching one?

51
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,740
There are already enough venomous snakes

52
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,060
in your room.

53
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,940
Humph.

54
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,580
Looks like she's found a blessing in disguise.

55
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,700
The venomous snake saved her.

56
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,780
Otherwise, she would have died long ago

57
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,060
as she'd been out of the mist for so long.

58
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,820
No time to lose.

59
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,620
We need to hurry back.

60
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,340
Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?

61
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,900
Like stomach ache,

62
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,940
headache, or hand ache?

63
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,860
Just a bit dizzy.

64
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,700
I've been training for so long

65
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,190
but couldn't make myself immune to all poisons.

66
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,940
You did it all at once.

67
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,900
What?

68
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,460
Don't want to talk to you anymore.

69
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,380
Just get lost.

70
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,740
The Dragon Pill is ready for you.

71
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,820
Though it can't completely detoxify him,

72
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,740
it can keep him alive

73
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,980
for several more decades.

74
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,940
His health may be a bit worse.

75
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,860
Tell me.

76
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,140
Where is the Main Altar of Flash Sect?

77
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,780
I really can't tell you.

78
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,940
Xiaoren trusted me.

79
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,420
If I tell you,

80
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,420
she'll never talk to me again.

81
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,700
Li Wei, get it straight.

82
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,620
Yao is my wife.

83
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,460
Whether you tell me or not,

84
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,660
I won't allow you to see her again.

85
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,860
You're seeking personal revenge.

86
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,460
It's all personal. Why can't I do that?

87
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,540
Tell me.

88
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,140
Jun Mo.

89
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,140
Xiaoren, you're finally here.

90
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,260
He wants to kill me.

91
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,380
What happened?

92
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,540
Who let you go to such a dangerous place?

93
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,060
I...

94
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,380
Don't disturb their reunion.

95
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,540
Are you injured?

96
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,090
Right.

97
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,580
The Dragon Pill.

98
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,140
This is quite a treasure.

99
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,940
To get it,

100
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,100
I had to eat poison,

101
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,460
went into the poison mist,

102
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,980

What's wrong?

131
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,660
Just received news

132
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,780
of unusual movements in the Palace.

133
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,960
Something might go wrong.

134
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,940
Looks like they started it.

135
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,420
I'll immediately gather the troops

136
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,260
and enter the city.

137
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,700
Wait.

138
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,270
I'll go back and take a look.

139
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,550
What?

140
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,860
You want to go back alone?

141
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,980
Your Highness, absolutely not.

00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,180

Let me.

145
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,860
See it?

146
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,860
This is the Emperor's token.

147
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,100
I'm the Emperor's secret envoy.

148
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,300
How dare you address His Majesty directly.

149
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,380
It's a capital crime!

150
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,500
Why isn't it working?

151
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,380
You have to say His Majesty.

152
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,820
Look again.

153
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,060
This is His Majesty's token.

I'm His Majesty's secret envoy.

155
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,020
His Majesty has decreed

156
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,620
that anyone holding this token

157
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,860
shall be executed without mercy.

158
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:12,970
Wait!

159
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,380
I am the Seventh Prince, Jun Mo.

160
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,820
Ask your leader to see me.

161
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,740
You're impressive.

162
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,580
Why do you still have

163
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,580
this token?

164
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,300
I...

165
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,020
I just felt

166
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,660
it might come in handy today,

167
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,120
so I brought it out again.

168
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,260
Looks like you have some lingering feelings.

169
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,460
What lingering feelings?

170
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,180
Nonsense.

171
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,620
It's best not to.

172
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,460
There never was.

173
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,980

00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,600

are under the control of the Crown Prince.

181
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,700
I can't do anything about it.

182
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,140
Are you saying

183
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,300
I need the Crown Prince's permission

184
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,020
to get back home?

185
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,700
