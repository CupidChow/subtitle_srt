=Episode 21=

16
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,220
Mo Wei, what are you doing?

17
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,000
Can't you see?

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,330
He is my servant.

19
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,680
Of course, he must kneel to me.

20
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,130
Mo Wei,

21
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,600
what are you doing?

22
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,120
I am doing what I should do.

23
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,510
I'll kill you.

24
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,500
He is my servant.

25
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,080
Only I can kill him.

26
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,390
Thank you, Your Majesty.

27
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,930
I almost forgot

28
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,760
you also know Meihua Blade.

29
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,870
I was the one who sent you to Flash Sect.

30
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,010
I taught you Meihua Blade.

31
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,660
Do you remember

32
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,290
how you practiced?

33
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,470
I remember.

34
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,470
When you taught me Meihua Blade,

35
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,430
it was just like today.

36
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,690
I don't understand.

37
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,640
I really don't understand.

38
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,130
Mo Wei,

39
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,680
tell her before she dies.

40
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,930
Zuo Feng indeed

41
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,160
framed Zhao Li back then,

42
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,290
but it was all

43
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,510
on the Empress's orders.

44
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,410
Actually,

45
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,180
Zhao Li escaped.

46
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,000
It was also on the Empress's orders

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,390
that I led the Twelve Generals

48
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,600
to hunt him down.

49
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,120
So it was all your doing.

50
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,160
Teaching you Meihua Blade

51
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,890
was to show you

52
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,580
that once something is released,

53
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,800
taking it back will cause bloodshed.

54
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,010
Isn't this the way to Fengyi Palace?

55
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,430
Bend over.

56
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,760
Bend over.

57
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
Which eunuch

58
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,240
walks as straight as you?

59
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,060
- Like this?
- Yes.

60
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,460
- Bend more.
- Okay, okay.

61
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,460
Right. What did you say earlier?

62
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,540
I asked.

63
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,080
Is this the way to Fengyi Palace?

64
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,870
Yes. Didn't I tell you?

65
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,010
I'm taking you to see Jun Mo.

66
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,600
What is he doing in Fengyi Palace?

67
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,140
He's fighting with your wife.

68
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,930
Where are you going?

69
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,540
Let's go.

70
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,120
Bend over.

71
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,360
Some wounds, even if they heal,

72
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,160
will leave scars.

73
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,890
Stop being cryptic.

74
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,620
Why did you save me back then

75
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,970
and teach me martial arts?

76
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,700
Because Zhao Li

77
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,970
was very important to me.

78
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,580
When I first entered the Palace,

79
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,430
I was just a concubine,

80
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,010
never fighting, never arguing,

81
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,970
until one year,

82
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,700
I gave birth to the first prince

83
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,100
before the Empress.

84
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,950
At that time,

85
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,780
Empress Xiao's family was powerful.

86
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,250
Even the Emperor's ascent to the throne

87
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,290
relied on her father.

88
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,200
Since then, I've become

89
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,760
a thorn in her side.

90
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,910
Even a maid

91
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,970
could beat and scold me at will.

92
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,160
Until I met

93
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,600
General Zhao.

94
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,800
Ling, you're here.

95
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,550
I saved a fruit for you.

96
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,590
Eat.

97
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,040
Can you come earlier next time?

98
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,390
The food is always cold.

99
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,750
Other concubines give us gold and silver,

100
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,260
but you always give me rotten fruits.

101
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,680
It's my fault.

102
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,570
Here.

103
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,390
Take this.

104
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,950
I can't accept it.

105
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,830
If the Empress finds out, she'll kill me.

106
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,960
I won't tell. No one will know.

107
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,600
Are you trying to kill me?

108
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,430
Stop it.

109
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,430
General Zhao.

110
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,220
A maid dares to be so bold.

111
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,120
I won't dare anymore.

112
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,500
Please forgive me.

113
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
I won't dare anymore.

114
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,830
It was General Zhao who gave me

115
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,460
the courage to live.

116
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,260
Stop talking nonsense.

117
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,710
If my father saved you,

118
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,290
why did you kill him?

119
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,970
He was kind to me,

120
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,410
taught me Tu Luo martial arts

121
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,510
to protect myself.

122
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,330
But he ignored

123
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,760
my love for him.

124
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,010
Years later, after a victory,

125
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,080
he collected evidence against me.

126
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,800
How could he treat me like this?

127
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,500
Master saw your ambition,

128
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,540
so he stayed away from you.

129
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,500
How many people have you killed for power?

130
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,180
Why are you so obsessed?

131
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,620
Shut up.

132
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,540
Jun Mo.

133
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,020
I spared you

134
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,540
for your father's sake.

135
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,790
Teaching you Meihua Blade,

136
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,940
instead of other martial arts,

137
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,980
was to prevent today.

138
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,140
If you don't kill us all today,

139
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,900
your scandals will be known to the world.

140
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,740
Then I will kill everyone.

141
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,020
Why are you still standing there?

142
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,580
Your Majesty.

143
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,500
Can I

144
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,270
still trust you?

145
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,420
Of course.

146
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,460
You won't keep your promise.

147
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,580
You'll abandon me cruelly

148
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,580
like sixteen years ago.

149
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,220
How dare you betray me!

150
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,140
I've never betrayed you.

151
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,380
I only betrayed

152
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,060
my own conscience.

153
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,180
Your Majesty, do you know

154
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,900
how I've spent

155
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,540
these sixteen years?

156
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,180
I haven't slept a single peaceful night.

157
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,700
I often asked myself.

158
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,380
Was this right or wrong?

159
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,660
In this world,

160
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,740
there is no real right or wrong.

161
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,820
Just like you.

162
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,820
For your so-called power and desires,

163
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,420
you can kill everyone.

164
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,380
And I?

165
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,560
I am

166
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,160
just your pawn.

167
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,020
Or rather,

168
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,540
your abandoned pawn.

169
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,420
Today,

170
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,980
I am here to atone.

171
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,460
For those

172
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,620
who died

173
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,700
for this struggle and desire.

174
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,860
Because

175
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,580
I want you to die with me.

176
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,940
Are you alright?

177
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,740
Still trying to run?

178
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,540
Do you know who I am?

179
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,660
I am the Crown Prince.

180
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,650
I know.

181
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,520
Do you really think you can kill me?

182
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,700
If you want your son to live,

183
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,020
Surrender now.

184
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,780
Mother, save me.

185
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,020
Shut up.

186
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,740
Is he really your son?

187
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,020
You're not her biological son?

188
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,940
Nonsense.

189
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,740
Every son is born from his mother.

190
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,740
Do you have anything else to say?

191
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,860
You always thought

192
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,420
Zhao Li betrayed you,

193
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,380
But haven't you betrayed me as well?

194
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,420
For you,

195
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,500
I killed everyone.

196
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,580
I killed Zhao Li,

197
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,460
killed the princes,

198
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,740
and cleared all obstacles

199
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,940
for you.

200
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,340
Why?

201
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,380
Why?

202
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,340
Why can't I ever

203
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,140
get a shred

204
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,500
of your love?

205
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,940
We're separated by mountains and seas.

206
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,640
Mountains and seas cannot be leveled.

207
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,460
You insisted on being this pathetic person,

208
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,220
but I'm different.

209
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,140
I will destroy

210
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,380
what I can't get.

211
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,420
Sixteen years ago,

212
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,740
I needed your martial arts

213
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,900
and power.

214
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,820
Now I have great power

215
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,980
and unmatched strength.

216
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,340
Do you think I don't know

217
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,500
your tricks?

218
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,220
Pervert.

219
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,580
You are Zuo Xiachan,

220
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,140
Zuofeng's daughter?

221
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,740
Yes.

222
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,220
I heard you were sold

223
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,380
to a brothel as a child,

224
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,180
and then joined Flash Sect.

225
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,980
How do you know?

226
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,020
You are not young anymore.

227
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,100
You should know some things

228
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,980
about your family back then.

229
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,020
I give you a chance.

230
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,740
Release the Crown Prince and surrender to me,

231
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,420
I'll ensure you a life of wealth and glory.

232
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,940
So you like him.

233
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,580
Alright.

234
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,340
I'll deprive him of his martial arts

235
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,460
and give him to you.

236
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,420
Not everyone will make deals
with you for money.

237
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,860
Actually, I can do it.
