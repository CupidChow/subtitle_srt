Mr. Leader.

17
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,620
The Crown Prince is a prince.

18
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,220
The Seventh Prince is also a prince.

19
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,330
If they have a conflict,

20
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,290
it's like the tongue hitting the teeth.

21
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,100
But you are different.

22
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,120
Offending the Seventh Prince,

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,970
what good will it do you?

24
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,950
- This...
- Enough.

25
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,470
Why are you still hesitating?

26
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,410
Where

27
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,870
does your family live?

28
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,080
When I have time,

29
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,200
I will personally visit

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,760
to thank you.

31
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,300
Enough.

32
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,640
Let's go.

33
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,430
We also

34
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,640
should go.

35
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,760
Your Highness.

36
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,050
Your Highness, don't!

37
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,510
Jun Mo,

38
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,600
I was just about to look for you,

39
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,760
and here you are.

40
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,220
Did you hear?

41
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,790
- Father has already drafted a decree
- Who is he?

42
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:22,950
to abdicate in my favor.

43
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,800
The Crown Prince.

44
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,760
You heard this

45
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,970
and came to congratulate me, right?

46
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,220
I want to see Father.

47
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,510
What right do you have?

48
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,790
I am also Father's child.

49
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:44,890
Are you?

50
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,950
Then why was your mother

51
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,330
confined to the Cold Palace

52
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,890
and ordered to die?

53
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,260
So, when you're angry,

54
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,050
you're like this.

55
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,550
I was joking with you.

56
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,160
You look so much like Father.

57
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,010
How could you not be his son?

58
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,100
You are here too.

59
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,260
I just want to see Father.

60
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,640
Don't push me.

61
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,760
What if I do?

62
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,850
Haven't seen you for a few days.

63
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,470
You've become quite haggard.

64
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,290
It seems my younger brother

65
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,430
hasn't treated you well.

66
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,850
You're seeking death.

67
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,510
Try me.

68
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,010
Jun Mo,

69
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,010
it seems the poison in you

70
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,010
still hasn't healed.

71
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,300
The Crown Prince is so mighty.

72
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,550
Who are you?

73
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,510
I am your admirer.

74
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,970
Your tone

75
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,640
is just like those women in brothels.

76
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,100
What did you say?

77
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,290
Too old to hear clearly,

78
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,800
and still trying to seduce me.

79
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,370
Who are you calling old? You are old.

80
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,300
Guards,

81
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,160
take them all away.

82
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,100
Yes.

83
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,090
Jun Mo,

84
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,970
you should really be here,

85
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,500
so you can see

86
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,510
what I'll do to your woman.

87
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,800
Where is Jun Mo?

88
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,100
Where else could he be?

89
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,970
Of course, with my mother.

90
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,120
It seems your mother likes him

91
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,100
more than you.

92
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,600
So what?

93
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,970
I am her son.

94
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,220
Does bullying me fulfill your ulterior desire?

95
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,660
Mother,

96
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,850
I dare not do it again.

97
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,160
If there is a next time,

98
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,330
you will lose your position

99
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,390
as the Crown Prince.

100
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,260
Let me see Father.

101
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,600
My son, you have been wronged.

102
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,380
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

103
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,830
Let's sit down

104
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,850
and chat.

105
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,260
Sit.

106
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,600
No need.

107
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,080
She can't hear.

108
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,710
She's also a poor soul.

109
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,300
She'll leave after you take it.

110
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,060
Lately,

111
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,140
how have you been at the villa?

112
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,740
Not good before.

113
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,220
Recently, I've been very well.

114
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,860
I just remembered

115
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,100
you got married.

116
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,380
You must like that girl a lot.

117
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,420
Yes.

118
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,860
The guards said

119
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,700
she was taken to the Crown Prince's Mansion.

120
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,980
Guard.

121
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,420
Your Majesty.

122
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,460
Go to the Crown Prince's Mansion

123
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,700
and bring the Crown Prince here.

124
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,580
Yes.

125
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,740
It's said

126
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,420
that this codfish bird's nest

127
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,140
can keep one youthful forever.

128
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,820
I drink it often,

129
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,180
but it doesn't seem to work.

130
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,580
Rumors are not reliable.

131
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,820
Is that so?

132
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,500
There are also rumors

133
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,260
that you are courting court officials

134
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,540
with the intention of rebellion.

135
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,060
Is it true?

136
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,900
There are also rumors

137
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,060
that you colluded with Flash Sect

138
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,500
sixteen years ago

139
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,700
to frame loyal officials.

140
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,700
Is it true?

141
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,060
If my son

142
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,060
had your courage and strategy,

143
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,620
how wonderful it would be.

144
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,060
Your Majesty.

145
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,460
Can't you call me

146
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,420
Mother?

147
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,740
You are not my mother.

148
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,500
How can I call you Mother?

149
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,160
I liked you since you were a child.

150
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,540
If you want,

151
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,460
I can help you become the Crown Prince,

152
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,620
even the future Emperor.

153
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,540
But you always act this way,

154
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,500
saying the most heartless words

155
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,300
with the most obedient demeanor.

156
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,100
Obedience is because I want to live.

157
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,420
Not following your orders

158
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,460
is because I want to live

159
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,460
as a human.

160
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,980
You are still the same.

161
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,940
I am too disappointed.

162
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,300
Is the Crown Prince really
going to give her to us?

163
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,420
Really. How dare I lie to you about this?

164
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,540
Let's go. That little girl is so enchanting.

165
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,380
Let's go.

166
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,980
Let's go. We can do it together.

167
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,060
Are you

168
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,940
here to save me?

169
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,740
Yes, we are here to save you.

170
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,220
Great.

171
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,340
How should I repay you?

172
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,340
Repay with your body.

173
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,340
Aren't you coming in?

174
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,500
Then I'll come in.

175
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,580
Once you're in,

176
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,460
don't go out.

177
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,660
Go.

178
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,020
So you want to anger me

179
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,540
and control me like my mother,

180
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,820
