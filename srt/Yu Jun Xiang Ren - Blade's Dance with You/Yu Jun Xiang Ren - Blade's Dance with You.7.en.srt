She's also Xiaoren's cousin.

Do you know each other?

18
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,250
No, they don't.

19
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,610
She's my distant cousin.

20
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,000
Distant cousin?

21
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,080
Jun Mo!

22
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,020
(Good Times)

23
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,520
So many people here.

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,220
This is a specialty from the border

25
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,750
that my father brought back.

26
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:40,790
Zhu Dabao,

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,950
I told you not to come to the villa

28
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,290
unless necessary.

29
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,340
Miss,

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,080
may I join you?

31
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,370
This is my sister-in-law, right?

32
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,920
Good eye.

33
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,250
Shut up.

34
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,790
So this is my sister-in-law?

35
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,130
Eat.

36
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,660
If you say another word,

37
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,870
I'll throw you out.

38
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,600
Eat.

39
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,950
Why tell him to shut up?

40
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,370
Am I embarrassing you?

41
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,880
I'm not eating anymore.

42
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,370
Then I'm full too.

43
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,620
Let's eat. Let's eat.

44
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,750
Come on, eat.

45
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,920
Eat.

46
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,220
Xiaoren.

47
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,220
Why are you here?

48
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,620
It's all because of you.

49
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,540
Because of me?

50
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,580
Your task is to kill Jun Mo.

51
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,100
Why did you marry him?

52
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,900
I have my reasons.

53
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,740
What reasons?

54
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,940
You wouldn't understand.

55
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,420
It's my own business.

56
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,220
I don't care what you say,

57
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,860
the Chief has ordered it.

58
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,860
Both you and Jun Mo must die.

59
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,380
There will be assassins arriving in a few days.

60
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,020
The scenery here is quite nice.

61
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,380
It seems your specialty isn't the whip.

62
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,380
You've seen through

63
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,100
my little trick.

64
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,340
Want to know their relationship?

65
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,940
You whipped her last night.

66
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,660
I noted it down for her.

67
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,260
Li Wei,

68
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,060
are you weak?

69
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,420
Back so soon?

70
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,380
What are you talking about, Xiachan?

71
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,120
Zuo Xiachan,

72
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,760
I haven't settled the score
with you from yesterday.

73
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,460
If you don't use hidden weapons,

74
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,460
I can surely take you.

75
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,260
Are you admitting

76
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,340
I'm better?

77
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,420
Stop arguing.

78
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,940
Let's discuss

79
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,380
how to help Xiaoren.

80
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,340
Help with what?

81
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,020
The Flash Sect has issued a kill order.

82
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,900
Who can help her?

83
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,260
We can.

84
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,740
We?

85
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,340
You're useless now.

86
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,060
You still need me.

87
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,180
If you don't want to help, fine.

88
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,540
You can leave tomorrow.

89
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,380
Now you're getting upset?

90
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,660
Let me tell you, Zhao Xiaoren.

91
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,860
We've already helped you

92
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,020
block several waves of assassins.

93
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,940
Xiaoren,

94
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,100
Xiachan didn't mean

95
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,380
to whip you.

96
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,020
And

97
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,180
these past few days,

98
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,420
she's really blocked several waves

99
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,540
of the Flash Sect for you.

100
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,740
Thanks.

101
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,740
Are you and Jun Mo really married?

102
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,300
Of course not.

103
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,660
I knew it was fake.

104
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,860
It's good then.

105
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,820
I knew Jun Mo's taste

106
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,980
wouldn't be so bad.

107
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,260
What do you mean?

108
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,220
Isn't it obvious?

109
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,540
Your looks

110
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,540
are just okay.

111
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,740
Your figure

112
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,220
is not a match for him at all.

113
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,300
Only I am a perfect match for him.

114
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,940
What are you implying?

115
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,740
Who has a bad figure?

116
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,700
You tell me.

117
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,460
Look in the mirror when you have time.

118
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,540
Look at me carefully.

119
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,700
Who has a bad figure?

120
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,060
- Stop arguing.
- Who has a bad figure?

121
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,100
Enough.

122
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,060
We're now targets

123
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,380
of the Flash Sect's kill order too.

124
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,540
We need to stick together now.

125
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,700
What do you mean?

126
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,460
The kill order?

127
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,540
Is it because of me?

128
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,740
This fool insisted on blocking for you.

129
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,380
He's useless now,

130
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,900
so I had to step in.

131
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,460
Useless?

132
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,900
You...

133
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,420
What do you mean by "useless"?

134
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,420
Ask him.

135
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,420
Li Wei.

136
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,620
You...

137
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,820
What does she mean?

138
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,660
What does she mean by "useless"?

139
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,780
I'm fine.

140
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,300
Don't listen to her nonsense.

141
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,820
You come here.

142
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,180
Tell me.

143
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,300
What do you mean by "useless"?

144
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,500
Why are you shouting?

145
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,580
I've never seen someone so ungrateful.

146
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,300
I...

147
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,500
He liked you for so many years

148
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
and did so much for you,

149
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
but you ran here to marry someone else.

150
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,940
I said it's fake.

151
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,580
Didn't you sleep in the same room?

152
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,420
Stop it.

153
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,780
I believe her.

154
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,700
You're such a fool.

155
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,070
You stole the Emperor's token for her.

156
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,620
Did she marry you?

157
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,380
She married her target.

158
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,060
What did you just say?

159
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,300
The Emperor's token?

160
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,180
Xiaoren,

161
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,780
didn't you say

162
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,420
if I could get something

163
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,260
to command the world,

164
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,020
you'd marry me?

165
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,900
So I went to steal it.

166
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,340
Are you saying

167
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,580
this is the Emperor's token?

168
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,980
I almost forgot.

169
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,260
You can't read.

170
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,180
Because of this,

171
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,780
Li Wei almost died,

172
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,780
and you had no idea.

173
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,140
Look.

174
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:35,910
Li Wei,

175
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,540
how can you be so foolish?

176
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,260
Xiaoren,

177
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,620
I'm fine.

178
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,700
I'm just a bit injured,

179
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,020
and my martial arts are a bit weaker now.

180
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,660
You won't despise me, will you?

181
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,420
How can you be so foolish?

182
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,940
I'm really fine.

183
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,100
You can't do

184
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,220
such dangerous things again.

185
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,380
Do you understand?

186
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,540
Sure.

187
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,900
Someone's here.

188
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,660
What have you done?

189
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,220
You got the master killed

190
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,980
and Yao buried alive.

191
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,700
When you finally found her,

192
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,060
you treated her

193
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,780
so shamelessly.

194
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,220
No.

195
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,980
She mustn't recognize you.

196
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,980
She must hate you now.

197
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,020
That person is good to Yao.

198
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,900
If Yao likes him,

199
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,260
you must let her be.

200
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,220
Jun Mo,

201
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,580
what are you thinking?

202
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,820
Why do you still have

203
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,900
improper thoughts about Yao?

204
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,220
She doesn't like you at all.

205
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,220
- She hates you.
- What are you doing?

206
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,700
Cleaning the dust.

207
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,460
It's dirty.

208
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,180
Done talking?

209
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,380
So, it was you on the roof.

210
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,620
I...

211
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,940
I don't understand what you're talking about.

212
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,900
If you tell me

213
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,980
how you got the jade pendant,

214
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,180
I'll make sure

215
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,180
we leave immediately.

216
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,260
You want to leave?

217
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,900
If you tell me,

218
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,380
I'll leave right now.
