16
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,000
Your murderous intent

17
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,870
is too strong.

18
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,080
Mo Wei, die!

19
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,450
So, you were deceiving me.

20
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,160
Since you're here,

21
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,700
you'll die with him.

22
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,340
Stand down.

23
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,120
You can't kill him.

24
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,700
Then you go down first

25
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,660
to pave the way for him.

26
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,080
(If Yao were alive,)

27
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,410
(she'd be at your age.)

28
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,540
Awake?

29
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,040
Why didn't you kill me?

30
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,830
What's your father's name?

31
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,120
You don't deserve to know.

32
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,410
If you don't tell me, I can't help you.

33
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,040
Mo Wei has killed many.

34
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,750
(He's just fishing for information.)

35
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,000
(I must not fall for it.)

36
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,370
It's not me who wants to kill him.

37
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,590
It's the Leader.

38
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,160
I see.

39
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,620
So, he knows.

40
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,750
Go back and tell him.

41
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,540
Mo Wei's life is mine.

42
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,540
When the time comes, I will kill him myself.

43
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,200
(What is he talking about?)

44
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,790
(I can't ask yet.)

45
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,120
(Asking would give me away.)

46
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,880
Fine.

47
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,120
I will convey your words

48
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,000
exactly to the Leader.

49
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,500
Stay here.

50
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,080
What have you been doing behind my back?

51
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,250
Please forgive me.

52
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,830
I only did

53
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,120
what you should have done.

54
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,410
Stop speaking in riddles,

55
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,830
or I'll raze Jasmine Villa

56
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,950
to the ground.

57
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,660
My Lord, please calm down.

58
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,450
This villa is Mr. Mo's hard work.

59
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,830
It can't be destroyed.

60
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,670
Shut up.

61
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,540
This is none of your business.

62
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,370
I have secretly recalled

63
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,500
the border military commanders

64
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,160
and tens of thousands of soldiers.

65
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,410
We're just waiting for your command

66
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,250
to help you clear out the court.

67
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,450
Things have come to this point.

68
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,250
My Lord, you can kill me.

69
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,040
I have no other intention.

70
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,120
But this matter involves

71
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,500
the lives of tens of thousands of soldiers.

72
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,540
My death is insignificant,

73
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,750
but please reconsider.

74
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,200
So, you did this

75
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,580
all alone.

76
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,250
No wonder Father wants to kill you.

77
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,040
You have talents for governance,

78
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,830
yet you were exiled to Jasmine Villa,

79
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,540
letting that mother and son

80
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,580
wreak havoc in the court.

81
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,620
I couldn't stand it.

82
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,410
- Shut up.
- No, I must speak.

83
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,370
You are impudent.

84
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,040
My Lord, please calm down.

85
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,880
My Lord.

86
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,040
If I didn't agree,

87
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,040
who could exile me?

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,330
I just don't want to fight

89
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,580
and see more bloodshed.

90
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,950
I just want a peaceful life.

91
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,290
Is that too much to ask?

92
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,830
If you think this way,

93
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,120
it's not tolerance,

94
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,120
but constant retreat.

95
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,410
This is too selfish.

96
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,910
Should the people suffer

97
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,950
because you want

98
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,000
a peaceful life?

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,840
Enough.

100
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,780
I know what I have to say

101
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,860
and what I must do.

102
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,300
I have planned this

103
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,420
for years.

104
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,380
It's not for myself

105
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,980
but to help you

106
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,620
ascend the throne,

107
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,500
so the people can live prosperous lives.

108
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,260
This is

109
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,780
my only motivation to live.

110
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,420
As the seventh prince,

111
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,780
you were born into royalty.

112
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,180
You should bear your responsibilities,

113
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,700
rather than retreat.

114
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,540
The people

115
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,380
shed blood for you.

116
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,100
Can you bear to watch?

117
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,700
This is not a reason for your rebellion.

118
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,820
If the Emperor wants the minister dead,

119
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,580
the minister must obey.

120
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,740
I'm not your Emperor.

121
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,220
When it's time to kill you,

122
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,950
I'll do it myself.

123
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,940
I'm warning you.

124
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,420
Don't act rashly.

125
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,420
In the south of the city,
spring has come again.

126
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,260
Only plum blossoms can be seen.

127
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,620
Humans may suffer thousands of diseases.

128
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,700
Only longing

129
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,460
is incurable.

130
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,380
You came so soon.

131
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,260
Order from our master.

132
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,580
If you step out of Jasmine Villa,

133
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,420
we'll kill you.

134
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,140
(Jasmine Villa)

135
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,020
Your Highness,

136
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,900
I have thoroughly investigated.

137
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,860
Those assassins

138
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,900
were sent by the Crown Prince.

139
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,380
I know.

140
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,780
Your Highness, don't you understand yet?

141
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,380
The Crown Prince and the Empress Dowager

142
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,220
will not spare you.

143
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,700
This is my business.

144
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,820
Your Highness.

145
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,380
Leave the villa tonight.

146
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,180
I can't leave.

147
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,300
If I leave,

148
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,300
who will protect you?

149
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,180
No more discussion.

150
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,420
Don't forget your mission.

151
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,940
Even if you search the ends of the earth,

152
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,100
dig through the snowy mountains,

153
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,980
you must find Yao.

154
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,420
Understood.

155
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,060
I will see to it immediately.

156
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,020
Come back after Zhao Xiaoren leaves

157
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,540
in a few days.

158
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,780
Your Highness, you mustn't.

159
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,740
The best thing to do

160
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
is kill her.

161
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,340
Haven't you killed enough?

162
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,260
I know she works for His Majesty,

163
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,500
but

164
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,220
if you find Lu Zuo's daughter

165
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,380
and deny ever meeting her,

166
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,620
even His Majesty can't do anything.

167
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,820
Do you want to repeat your mistakes?

168
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,580
Your errors from the past

169
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,460
are enough for me to tear you to pieces.

170
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,980
I have you searching for Yao

171
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,940
to let you atone for your sins.

172
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,140
Understood.

173
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,780
I can die for that,

174
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,380
but

175
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,460
if Zhao Xiaoren remains alive,

176
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,580
too many will die.

177
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,540
I understand your thoughts.

178
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,220
If that's the case,

179
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,540
I have another plan.

180
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,900
Make Zhao Xiaoren

181
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,180
truly become yours.

182
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,660
What do you mean?

183
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,020
With your appearance,

184
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,700
not just ordinary women,

185
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,820
even many men would praise

186
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,400
your looks

187
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,580
after meeting you.

188
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,220
Nonsense.

189
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,500
This is not nonsense.

190
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,460
Your Highness,

191
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,220
if you show Zhao Xiaoren

192
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,700
more care

193
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,540
and affection,

194
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,380
she will fall for you

195
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,820
and be unable to extricate herself.

196
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,220
Where have you been?

197
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,700
I...

198
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,460
made you some glutinous rice balls.

199
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,220
Nonsense.

200
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,300
You went to find Mo Wei.

201
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,980
I did go to find him,

202
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,340
but he had already left.

203
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,340
(He really let Mo Wei go.)

204
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,060
(But why is he smiling at me?)

205
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,260
(What's his scheme?)

206
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,300
Why are you just standing there?

207
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,460
Do you want me to feed you?

208
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,420
Don't come closer.

209
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,020
What are you afraid of?

210
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,740
They're just glutinous rice balls.

211
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,820
I made them myself.

212
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,180
Are you insane?

213
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,460
Strange. Don't follow me.

214
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,860
(Steady and Sustained)

215
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,420
I told you not to follow me.

216
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,260
Glutinous rice balls.

217
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,500
What are you doing?

218
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,420
Eat.

219
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:46,660
(Didn't Mo Wei say)

220
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,380
(if I'm gentle and considerate,)

221
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,100
(she'll fall for me?)

222
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,180
(Why does she seem like I'm driving her mad?)

223
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,580
You poisoned these, didn't you?

224
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,820
I'll eat them, okay?

225
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,260
Be careful. It's hot.

226
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,500
Zhao Xiaoren!

227
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,900
I never want to see you again.

228
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,100
I must kill Mo Wei.

229
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,500
Tell me where he is.

230
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,220
Go back and tell His Majesty

231
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,520
I'll handle

232
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,260
Mo Wei.

233
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,420
His Majesty?

234
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,660
What are you talking about?

235
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,780
Don't you know His Majesty?

236
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,660
Of course, I know His Majesty.

237
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,540
He's the Emperor.

238
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,900
(Why did he suddenly mention the Emperor?)

239
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,300
I warn you.

240
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,380
The Leader ordered me to bring Mo Wei back.

241
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,260
You'd better tell me

242
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,460
where he is.

243
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,900
(She's lying.)

244
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,420
(Who is she really?)

245
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,380
Mo Wei will return in a few days.

246
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,460
Stay in the villa

247
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,220
and wait for him.

248
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,300
(If I kill him, I won't see Mo Wei.)

249
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,420
(What should I do?)

250
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,500
(The Chief's time is running out.)

251
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,620
I'll say it again.

252
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,620
Don't wander around.

253
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,660
Don't waste it.

254
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,900
(Steady and Sustained)

255
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,580
What's going on?

256
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,820
Your Highness,

257
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,660
they were guarding outside Jasmine Villa.

258
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,940
They were found dead in the bamboo forest
outside the city this morning.

259
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,180
Useless.

260
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,780
Clean it up.

261
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,980
Send more men

262
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,340
to watch Jasmine Villa closely.

263
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,460
- Yes.
- Wait.

264
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,500
Mother, why are you here?

265
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,740
Have you forgotten

266
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,340
what I told you?

267
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,580
What did you say?

268
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,180
I told you to stay in the mansion

269
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,820
and do nothing.

270
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,020
If you want to secure the throne,

271
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,940
you must get there legitimately.

272
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,540
If you cause a commotion

273
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,820
and can't handle the result,

274
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,540
when your father finds out,

275
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,100
even I can't help you.

276
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,840
I understand, Mother.

277
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,100
But these three

278
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,380
acted on their own.

279
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,620
You can't blame me, Mother.

280
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,740
Again with the slapping.

281
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,420
I told you

282
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,980
to stay put.

283
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,300
I will handle him.

284
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,660
How will you do that?

285
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,020
It's been years.

286
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,380
Everyone else is dead,

287
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,740
but he's still alive.

288
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,820
They heard too much.

289
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,780
They can't live.

290
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,260
If you kill them,

291
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,260
who will help me kill Jun Mo?

292
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,220
He won't live long either.

293
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,620
Wait for me.

294
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,100
Didn't I tell you to stay in the villa?

295
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,340
Why are you following me?

296
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,740
Following you to find Mo Wei.

297
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,500
Your target should be me, right?

298
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,060
Since you're here,

299
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,620
let's have a good talk.

300
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,700
In Chunhua Pavilion,

301
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,300
you were there to kill me.

302
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,540
You posed as Lu Zuo's daughter

303
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,980
to kill me.

304
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,780
What made you change your mind?

305
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,100
(He's too powerful.)

306
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,780
(I'm no match for him.)

307
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,940
Because...

308
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,460
Because I...

309
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,380
Do you recognize this jade pendant?

310
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,340
Of course not.

311
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,460
Because I...

312
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,300
You know Zhao Li.

313
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,340
I don't know what you're talking about.

314
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,540
Seems like you forgot your last lesson.

315
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,380
What are you going to do?

316
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,300
What I should have done long ago.

317
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,060
The Leader won't spare you.

318
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,940
Still so stubborn.

319
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,670
