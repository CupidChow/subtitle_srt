16
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,580
So you want to anger me

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,500
and control me like my mother,

18
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,380
right?

19
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,940
You women are all the same.

20
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,340
All like to control others.

21
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,500
I don't want to control you.

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,860
You are Jun Mo's woman,

23
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,420
worse than other women

24
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,660
and more detestable.

25
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,540
Who are you?

26
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,620
It seems you've been tormented

27
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,940
by your mother.

28
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,540
Don't remember me?

29
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,620
I am Jun Mo's wife,

30
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,180
your sister-in-law.

31
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,140
Absolutely impossible.

32
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,020
Luzuo's daughter cannot know martial arts.

33
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,180
Who are you really?

34
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,140
I am not Luzuo's daughter.

35
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,020
I am Zhao Xiaoren.

36
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,180
What Zhao Xiaoren? Zhao Daren?

37
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,660
Then let me test your skills.

38
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,740
Is that all you've got?

39
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,740
Don't scream.

40
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,580
If you dare scream,

41
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,580
I guarantee I'll kill you

42
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,660
before the guards come in.

43
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,140
Okay, okay, I won't scream.

44
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,540
What do you really want?

45
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,620
You'll find out soon.

46
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,100
Your Highness.

47
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,940
What?

48
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,620
What's the matter?

49
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,260
The Empress wants you to go to the Fengyi Hall.

50
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,980
Got it.

51
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,420
I'll go right away.

52
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,340
What are you looking at? Get out!

53
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,180
Yes.

54
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,580
Your Majesty.

55
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,820
What is it?

56
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,340
Your Majesty,

57
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,060
the Empress is unwell.

58
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,860
She wants you to come over.

59
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,660
Who are you?

60
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,980
I am new here,

61
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,540
serving the Empress.

62
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,820
Don't try to fool me.

63
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,660
She only has maids,

64
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,180
no eunuchs.

65
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,540
And those maids

66
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,620
are all deaf and mute.

67
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,940
(Oh, no, I've been exposed.)

68
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,450
Your Majesty,

69
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,420
the Crown Prince said he'll come
after changing his clothes.

70
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,180
Is there someone in his room?

71
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,300
A woman.

72
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,780
What are they doing?

73
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,380
The Crown Prince is standing in the hall.

74
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,820
The woman is standing behind him.

75
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,660
You may leave.

76
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,500
Yes.

77
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,340
You came prepared.

78
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,780
Your Majesty, you just praised

79
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,420
my courage.

80
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,420
You think using his life to threaten me

81
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,020
will make me comply?

82
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,140
You refuse?

83
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,900
Your Majesty,

84
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,340
I am here to save you.

85
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,580
Keep your voice down.

86
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,260
The guards outside

87
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,020
are all the Empress's men.

88
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,780
Your Majesty, I know.

89
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,180
Who is your master?

90
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,580
After I am saved,

91
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,700
I will promote you

92
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,020
and your master.

93
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,380
What position can you give?

94
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,180
What is your position now?

95
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,340
I...

96
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,860
I have no position.

97
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,950
I understand.

98
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,540
Then I appoint you

99
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,220
as the Grand Manager of the Imperial Palace.

100
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,060
Grand Manager?

101
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:53,860
Is that a high position?

102
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,220
Yes.

103
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,150
You will manage all the eunuchs

104
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,860
and maids in the palace.

105
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,820
Wait.

106
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,140
Why are all my subordinates eunuchs and maids?

107
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,540
Aren't you a eunuch?

108
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,940
I am not a eunuch.

109
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,740
Tell me quickly.

110
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,660
Who is your master?

111
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,460
I will reward him.

112
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,540
I have no master.

113
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,900
Jun Mo sent me.

114
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,220
Jun Mo?

115
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,980
Jun Mo.

116
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,800
What's wrong with you?

117
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,860
Then let's guess.

118
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,260
Whose body will be brought in next?

119
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,500
It seems I guessed wrong.

120
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,580
You love no one

121
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,980
but yourself.

122
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,660
Your mother was a very good person,

123
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,980
kind to everyone,

124
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,140
never fought or argued.

125
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,700
But what happened to her?

126
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,780
You are not worthy to mention her.

127
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,860
So your weak spot is here.

128
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,820
Then let me tell you.

129
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,340
It was because she never fought

130
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,860
that she was framed by Empress Xiao.

131
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,900
If I were like her,

132
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,020
I would die even more miserably.

133
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,980
Empress Xiao is already dead.

134
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,130
Yes.

135
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,620
She somehow died

136
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,220
in her own palace,

137
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,500
giving me the chance to become the Empress.

138
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,220
She got what she deserved.

139
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,220
When Empress Xiao was at her peak,

140
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,860
she forced your mother to death.

141
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,580
You were only nine that year.

142
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,900
Did you kill Empress Xiao?

143
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,020
How did you do it?

144
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,900
Walk faster.

145
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,100
You're a man. Don't dawdle.

146
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,260
Do you think you can survive?

147
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,220
Shut up.

148
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,980
I bet you won't kill me.

149
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,820
If you wanted to kill me,

150
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,780
you would have done it in the room.

151
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,380
Try me.

152
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,260
You want to use my life

153
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,140
in exchange for Jun Mo's life.

154
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,660
If you kill me, he will die too.

155
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,460
Why do you talk so much?

156
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,820
Walk faster.

157
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,980
Kill her. Quickly.

158
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,580
You are quite calm.

159
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,700
I saw you long ago.

160
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,500
Why is he here?

161
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,420
Don't ask.

162
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,060
I almost got harmed.

163
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,260
He saved me.

164
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,500
It's dark. We're ready to leave.

165
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,460
There are so many people outside.

166
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,620
How can we leave?

167
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,020
They just changed the guards.

168
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,820
I gave them some snacks

169
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,100
with sleeping drugs.

170
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,460
They are eating now.

171
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,020
Where do you want to take me?

172
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,460
To see Jun Mo.

173
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,820
Jun Mo.

174
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,100
Right.

175
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,060
Change into this.

176
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,180
Or we won't be able to leave.

177
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,700
Isn't this a eunuch's outfit?

178
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,700
At this point,

179
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,140
who cares if it's a eunuch's outfit?

180
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,820
Do you want to have more sons?

181
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,660
Well...

182
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,060
Come on, change quickly.

183
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,660
If we don't go now, it will be too late.

184
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,060
Fine, I'll change.

185
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,620
I didn't expect the person
who saved me was you.

186
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,980
I almost don't want to kill you.

187
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,460
Why do you have to kill me?

188
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,980
Because you are a prince.

189
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,700
Is that reason enough?

190
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,020
But I have already been exiled

191
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,220
to Jasmine Villa.

192
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,950
I never interfered

193
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,220
in court affairs.

194
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,900
So what?

195
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,020
You are still a prince

196
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,820
and can inherit the throne.

197
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,660
After my mother passed away,

198
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,260
all I wanted was to find Yao.

199
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,300
If I could find her,

200
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,740
I just wanted

201
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,260
to live a peaceful life with her.

202
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,500
But even like this,

203
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,140
you still won't let me go.

204
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,660
Because I don't trust you.

205
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,580
I only trust myself.

206
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,580
Everything that will happen today

207
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,100
is because of what you did.

208
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,860
The Crown Prince has arrived.

209
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,100
The Crown Prince is here.

210
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,500
Your wife must've been dead.

211
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,840
Mother.

212
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,780
You...

213
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,980
Xiaoren.

214
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,060
You are the Empress?

215
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,220
Yes, it's me.

216
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,180
- Yao.
- No.

217
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,180
Impossible.

218
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,860
Yao, what's wrong?

219
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,100
I always imagined you

220
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,660
as my mother.

221
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,620
Why did you deceive me?

222
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,300
All these years,

223
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,380
I indeed treated you

224
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,260
like my daughter.

225
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,420
Whether I'm your mother is up to you.

226
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,020
Your Majesty,

227
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,500
here I am.

228
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,900
