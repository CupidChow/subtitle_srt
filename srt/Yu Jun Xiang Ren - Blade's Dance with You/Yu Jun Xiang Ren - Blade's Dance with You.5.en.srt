83
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,940
reminds me of my mother.

85
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,740
Speaking of which,

86
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,980
you really like spitting

87
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,060
on people's faces.

88
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,660
When I did that before,

89
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,660
my mother would laugh and run away.

90
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,860
But why don't you run?

91
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,500
Because I don't want to be like your mother.

92
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,380
I'm teasing you.

93
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,580

96
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,020
What happened today?

97
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,580
Why is your hair so messy?

98
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,620
Nothing. Just went to the back mountain.

99
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,780
Got messed up accidentally.

100
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,180

Xiaoren,

102
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,380
don't tell me you like him.

103
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,740
Nonsense.

104
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,260
Even if all the men in the world died,

105
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,500
I wouldn't like him.

106
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,740
That's good.

107
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,740
Xiaoren, don't forget

108
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,060
he's the master of your father's killer.

109
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,060
Master?

110
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,860
How can he be Mo Wei's master?

111
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,120
Xiaoren,

112
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,660
this is Jasmine Villa.

113
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,100
Mo Wei is the Villa Master.

114
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,380
Who do you think can order

115
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,660
the Villa Master around?

116
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,180
But he promised me

117
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,260
that Mo Wei would return.

118
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,020
If what he said is true,

119
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,700
that means

120
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,580
he sent Mo Wei out on a mission.

121
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,940
So, they are in cahoots.

122
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,660
And he's Mo Wei's master.

123
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,140
(He bathes every day.)

124
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,060
(Definitely up to no good.)

125
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,940
(This is such a good opportunity.)

126
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,300
Where is he?

127
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:25,900
What?

128
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,820
Already here to kill me?

129
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,380
Seems like a lot of people

130
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,380
want you dead.

131
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,380
Even when bathing,

132
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,660
you're so cautious.

133
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,860
We're even now.

134
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,100
You saw me too.

135
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,660
Shameless.

136
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,260
You peeked at me bathing.

137
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,420
Am I the shameless one?

138
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,020
Who wants to peek at you?

139
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,660
Let go of me.

140
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,020
Let go of me.

141
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,540
Let go!

142
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,700
Let...!

143
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,660
Now,

144
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,380
you can't kill me at all.

145
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,660
Because you're so despicable.

146
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,300
You and Mo Wei

147
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,500
are both jerks.

148
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,180
You want me dead so badly?

149
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,620
Don't you deserve to die?

150
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,900
Master, please stop.

151
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,260
If you continue, many people will die.

Keep fighting,

164
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,860
I'll enjoy myself.

165
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,540
Since you're here,

166
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,420
why are you hiding?

167
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,580
Such a handsome face.

168
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,700
Just you?

169
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,340
To fight the two of you,

170
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,700
one is enough.

171
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,060
You're too confident.

172
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,660
Move!

173
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,100
It's been a long time

174
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,660

175
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,700
