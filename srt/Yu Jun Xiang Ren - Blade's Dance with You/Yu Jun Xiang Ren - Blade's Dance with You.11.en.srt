You are a prince.

I am the daughter of a criminal.

18
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,160
Mo Wei must die by my hands.

19
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,290
If you stop me,

20
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,040
one of us

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,250
must die.

22
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,910
Xiaoren, what's wrong?

23
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,330
You are right.

24
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,450
He's different from me.

25
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,410
Did something happen?

26
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,370
If you change your mind

27
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,500
because of something I said,

28
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,910
I can't bear that responsibility.

29
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,950
Tomorrow, we will kill Mo Wei

30
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,790
and leave.

31
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,910
But he

32
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,080
will definitely protect his own people.

33
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,370
Bring Mo Wei out.

34
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,620
Today,

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,120
I want an explanation

36
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,250
for my son's death.

37
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,710
Stop.

38
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
Mr. Jun Mo.

39
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:32,950
Who did it?

40
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,200
If I knew who did it,

41
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,660
why would I come here?

42
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,540
My son was foolish

43
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,450
and had only you as a friend.

44
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,290
He stayed overnight at the villa

45
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,950
and was found dead

46
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,750
on the street today.

47
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,660
Shouldn't I ask you

48
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,370
for an explanation?

49
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,130
You should.

50
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,910
But I was also attacked yesterday,

51
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,410
right on the Qianshi Street.

52
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,290
At that time,

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,250
Dabao wasn't with me.

54
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,420
So,

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,290
you mean to say

56
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,410
my son's death

57
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,750
has nothing

58
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,660
to do with you?

59
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,630
Of course not.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,840
Servant.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,840
Yes?

62
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,790
Bring Miss Chen here.

63
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,630
Yes.

64
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,410
What happened?

65
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,910
Mr. Zhu.

66
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,750
She is Miss Chen.

67
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,120
She is the killer?

68
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,450
The last person with Dabao yesterday

69
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:24,750
was her.

70
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,660
Mr. Zhu likes me so much.

71
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,040
I'm just a weak woman.

72
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,580
How could I kill him?

73
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,370
Many assassins appeared
on the street yesterday.

74
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,700
We were also attacked.

75
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,000
It might have been an accident.

76
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,290
Who are you?

77
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,040
Mr. Jun Mo is speaking.

78
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,540
How dare you

79
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,380
interrupt?

80
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,500
I am...

81
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,340
She is my wife.

82
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,210
Alright.

83
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,950
I won't make things difficult for you.

84
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,200
But I must

85
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,500
take this woman away.

86
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,830
Xiaoren.

87
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,120
With me here,

88
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,500
no one can touch her.

89
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,620
Mr. Jun Mo,

90
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,910
I respect you

91
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,620
because of Mr. Mo.

92
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,950
But I must

93
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,660
take this woman away.

94
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,290
She is indeed suspicious.

95
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,670
How dare you.

96
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,250
It seems

97
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,540
you do not know

98
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,500
the status of my Longwei Security

99
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,160
in the martial world.

100
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,580
Even Mo Wei

101
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,450
has to show me respect.

102
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,290
Guards!

103
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,040
Mr. Zhu,

104
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,290
she's in my villa.

105
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,790
You can only take her away

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,950
with my permission.

107
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,540
Without it,

108
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,250
you can't take

109
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,290
even a leaf.

110
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,040
When did this villa

111
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,950
become yours?

112
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,790
This villa is his.

113
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,580
My life

114
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,700
is also his.

115
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,290
Mo Wei.

116
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,420
Mr. Mo,

117
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,080
you finally came.

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,410
I have no time for nonsense.

119
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,660
I'll give you one piece of advice.

120
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,700
Leave immediately.

121
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,540
Mo Wei,

122
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,120
he killed my only son.

123
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,960
So what?

124
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,830
Compared to the world,

125
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,790
can't you tell which is more important?

126
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,200
What does his life count for?

127
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,040
Fine.

128
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,580
Then it will be a fight to the death.

129
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,370
Who are you?

130
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,370
You don't deserve to ask.

131
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,200
I warned you but you didn't listen.

132
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,660
Take Dabao

133
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,500
and leave.

134
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:42,790
Let's go.

135
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,630
Mo Wei,

136
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,660
do you recognize me?

137
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,290
No.

138
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,580
I am Zhao Li's daughter.

139
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,450
You are Yao.

140
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,540
Yao, you are still alive.

141
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,660
My Lord, she is alive.

142
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,250
This is great.

143
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,540
This is great.

144
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,500
Today, I will

145
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,580
avenge my father.

146
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,420
Stop.

147
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,450
Don't kill him yet.

148
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,790
Even you want to stop me?

149
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,580
Yao, give him a chance to explain.

150
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,450
Yao.

151
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,790
Yao.

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,200
You can kill me

153
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,080
but don't ruin

154
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,000
Mr. Jun Mo's future.

155
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,080
You two are indeed in cahoots.

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,500
Yao, let me explain.

157
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,080
I just returned from the Snowy Mountains.

158
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,040
Zhao Li's body

159
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,120
has been found.

160
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,660
Don't you want to see it?

161
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,370
What did you say?

162
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,500
For sixteen years,

163
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,080
I've been searching

164
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,370
for Zhao Li's body.

165
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,330
It's been frozen in the mountains,

166
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,080
while you are right by my side.

167
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,250
Father.

168
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,630
Father.

169
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,090
Father.

170
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,040
Father,

171
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,950
I will avenge you.

172
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,080
Master.

173
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,040
Stay back.

174
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,540
Yao.

175
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,790
I told you to stay back.

176
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,700
Let me pay my respects to Master.

177
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,830
You don't deserve it.

178
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,500
Yao.

179
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,590
Enough.

180
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,450
Yao died

181
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,500
sixteen years ago.

182
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,540
Sorry.

183
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,580
If you take one more step,

184
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,830
I'll kill you.

185
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,250
Let me explain.

186
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,830
What's there to explain?

187
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,450
It's all your fault my father died.

188
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,660
Master.

189
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,330
I caused Master's death.

190
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,790
I caused Master's death.

191
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,910
I'll kill you!
