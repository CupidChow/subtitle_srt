16
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,420
All the people in the villa are unreliable now.

17
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,800
Dismiss them all.

18
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,180
Yes.

19
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,880
I'll handle it right away.

20
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,080
Wait.

21
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,300
After this,

22
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,840
take some money

23
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,460
and go home

24
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,320
to enjoy your old age.

25
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,960
Mr. Mo.

26
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,800
Thank you

27
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,560
for all these years.

28
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,920
Go ahead.

29
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,340
Thank you

30
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,560
for your care all these years.

31
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,460
The villa guards are being replaced.

32
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,300
So what?

33
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,840
We're leaving today anyway.

34
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,860
Where's Xiaoren?

35
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,250
Last night, she said she wanted to say goodbye
to Jun Mo and didn't come back.

36
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,440
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

37
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,980
Isn't it normal?

38
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,980
They like each other.

39
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,680
Maybe they've reconciled by now.

40
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,400
Impossible.

41
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,500
She said she'd leave this time.

42
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,000
Don't be silly.

43
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,940
When a woman really loves a man,

44
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,560
it's hard to let go.

45
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,640
No matter what you do,

46
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,560
she won't feel it.

47
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,860
But

48
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,360
she promised.

49
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,520
The three of us

50
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,840
would travel the world
and fight injustice together.

51
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,760
Actually,

52
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,300
I have to part with you too.

53
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,140
Why?

54
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,520
Because she

55
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,040
did something against you.

56
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,560
Mo Wei.

57
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,620
Zhao Xiaoren spared you,

58
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,260
but we won't be nice to you.

59
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,160
Really?

60
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,660
Did you tell Zhao Xiaoren

61
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,600
that your father

62
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,160
is Zuo Feng?

63
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,320
Xiachan,

64
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,360
what does he mean?

65
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,760
So you found out.

66
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,420
Your father

67
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,380
framed Zhao Xiaoren's father.

68
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,900
How did my father frame him?

69
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,380
They're all dead.

70
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,660
Who knows if Zhao Li

71
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,540
colluded with the enemy?

72
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,640
I know.

73
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,900
I know everything.

74
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,520
Then tell us the truth.

75
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,020
Alright.

76
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,680
But first, tell me

77
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:41,900
the real reason

78
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,120
the Empress sent you here.

79
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,260
Nonsense.

80
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,800
We weren't sent by the Empress.

81
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,680
Getting old.

82
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,260
My movements

83
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,760
are slow now.

84
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,360
You're awake.

85
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,120
You're here.

86
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,600
Hungry?

87
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,000
I made you glutinous rice balls.

88
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:36,960
Silly.

89
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,660
How could you give me

90
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,680
your meager inner strength?

91
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,780
Do you know

92
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,860
you almost died?

93
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,520
I won't die.

94
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,460
From now on, I want to eat

95
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,700
these delicious rice balls every day.

96
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,740
I'll find out

97
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,420
what happened to Master

98
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,600
and clear his name.

99
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,880
But

100
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,460
that means

101
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,940
you'll face the Emperor,

102
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,840
Empress, and Crown Prince.

103
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,160
I didn't fight

104
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,020
before because I didn't want

105
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,600
to involve more innocent people.

106
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,460
I know the pain

107
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,840
of losing family.

108
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,680
Besides, Master left me,

109
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,480
and you weren't by my side.

110
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,840
My only reason to live

111
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,160
was to find you.

112
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,600
What about now?

113
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,820
Now,

114
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,420
I understand

115
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,720
only by taking the initiative

116
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,400
can more people live in peace.

117
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,080
And...

118
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,080
What else?

119
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,680
Now I live for you.

120
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,660
Alright.

121
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,780
Then from now on,

122
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,440
I live for you too.

123
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,620
Now eat.

124
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,700
Rest well after you finish.

125
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,800
I need to go out for a bit.

126
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,560
You can't go.

127
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,780
Wherever you go,

128
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,040
take me with you.

129
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,960
I need to interrogate Zuo Xiachan and Li Wei.

130
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,100
Do you think

131
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,680
they poisoned you?

132
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,680
They are the least suspicious,

133
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,720
but I need to confirm their identities.

134
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,960
Identities?

135
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,560
What do you mean?

136
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,040
Tell me.

137
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,760
Zuo Xiachan's father is Zuo Feng.

138
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,020
Li Wei's father

139
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,920
also died 16 years ago.

140
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,040
Zuo Xiachan.

141
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,400
Zuo Feng.

142
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,440
Yao,

143
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,300
I don't want you to go.

144
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,300
No.

145
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,560
I must go.

146
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,120
Zuo Xiachan,

147
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,700
stop pretending.

148
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,840
The needle is still in your mouth, right?

149
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,760
I didn't expect it to be you

150
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,120
to come here.

151
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,980
I didn't expect you

152
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,740
to be Zuo Feng's daughter.

153
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,520
Want to avenge your father?

154
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,000
Then kill me.

155
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,000
Spit it out.

156
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,200
Spit it out.

157
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,160
Come on, kill me.

158
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,300
Jun Mo said

159
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,940
you work for the Emperor

160
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,580
or the Empress.

161
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,520
Nonsense!

162
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,580
Zhao Xiaoren,

163
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,780
don't let Jun Mo

164
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,440
frame me.

165
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,620
Kill me if you want,

166
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,920
but don't insult me.

167
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,560
Don't overthink it.

168
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,660
It's because you and Li Wei

169
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,080
stole my father's notes.

170
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,000
I stole them.

171
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,560
It has nothing to do with Li Wei.

172
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,200
Who ordered you?

173
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,880
The Chief.

174
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,200
So, you said

175
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,300
you came to rescue me

176
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,880
and killed for me.

177
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,520
Was it all fake?

178
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,360
No.

179
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,880
If Li Wei wasn't injured,

180
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,800
it would have been his mission.

181
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,680
I found Li Wei after I got the mission

182
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,040
and asked him for help.

183
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,720
In return,

184
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,040
I had to protect you from the assassins.

185
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,580
I feel like you're lying to me.

186
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,880
Why would I lie?

187
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,600
After my father was killed,

188
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,560
my mother drowned herself,

189
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,720
and I was sold to a brothel.

190
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,480
Do you know what that place is like?

191
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,640
Your Highness,

192
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,540
all the guards in the villa

193
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,660
have been replaced

194
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,160
with soldiers from the border.

195
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,520
From now on,

196
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,560
there won't be any problems.

197
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,000
A few pages are missing from here.

198
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,900
It's alright.

199
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,040
I've seen it.

200
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,220
Those pages

201
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,220
recorded Zuo Feng's

202
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,480
corruption.

203
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,520
Zuo Xiachan probably

204
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,840
tore them out

205
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,060
to hide her identity.

206
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,880
Do you think they poisoned me?

207
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,960
It's hard to say.

208
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,340
The guards in the villa

209
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,180
didn't react

210
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,840
to the assassination attempt.

211
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,780
There might be drugs

212
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,880
in their food.

213
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,260
The assassins

214
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,480
were long-time servants in the villa.

215
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,100
They

216
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,100
must have been planted

217
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,300
years ago

218
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,260
by the Empress

219
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,000
or the Crown Prince.

220
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,580
Their actions

221
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,840
were coordinated,

222
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,360
so someone was directing them.

223
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,840
This is over now.

224
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,220
In the future,

225
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,700
if you want,

226
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,020
the army will enter the city.

227
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,260
Half of the officials

228
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,180
in the court

229
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,640
support you.

230
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,680
Don't act rashly.

231
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,760
I don't want a river of blood

232
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,020
unless absolutely necessary.

233
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,900
Seize the moment, Your Highness.

234
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,040
Enough.

235
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,100
Got it.

236
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,960
I mentioned the brothel

237
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,040
and you felt sorry for me.

238
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,400
What if I'm lying?

239
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,780
Jun Mo said

240
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,740
if you had no reaction

241
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,620
when I mentioned him,

242
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,440
then you aren't the one who poisoned him.

243
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,800
He's poisoned?

244
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,120
When?

245
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,520
None of your concerns.

246
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,920
He's my husband.

247
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,160
Such a possessive dog.

248
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,380
That's because this bone

249
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,440
is too tempting.

250
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,020
Some vixen

251
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,220
won't leave him alone.

252
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,060
Come on.

253
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,880
Where's Li Wei?

254
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,700
I was about to see him.

255
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,920
Do you want to come?

256
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,140
He's not working

257
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,320
for the Empress or the Emperor.

258
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,880
He's too naive.

259
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,780
With a friend like you,

260
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,960
he can still be like this.

261
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,600
It's really not easy.

262
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,740
Mo Wei's martial arts are very good.

263
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,640
I'm no match for him at all.

264
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,200
You must be careful of him.

265
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,460
Though he only killed my father under orders,

266
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,360
I will never forgive him.

267
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,560
After this is over,

268
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,520
I will seek him out for a life-and-death duel.
