My father wanted Jun Mo to be the Emperor.

17
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:04,630
Exactly.

18
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,040
I can feel it.

19
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,200
Master favored me a bit.

20
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,290
But he never mentioned

21
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,620
making me the Emperor.

22
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,620
He only taught me martial arts

23
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,250
and how to conduct myself.

24
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,420
And he always

25
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,450
told me to yield to the Crown Prince.

26
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,540
So,

27
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,000
your benevolence

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,790
won over many officials.

29
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,580
Even Zhao Li's old subordinates

30
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,750
lean towards you.

31
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:28,750
Think about it.

32
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,910
How can the Empress and Crown Prince,

33
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:31,750
even the Emperor,

34
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,120
be at ease in the court?

35
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,750
And I

36
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,120
am just a pawn.

37
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,830
I wasn't the one

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,330
who truly killed Zhao Li.

39
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,040
My father died unjustly.

40
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,910
If you want to avenge your father,

41
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,330
go to the Palace

42
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,040
and find the Emperor and Empress.

43
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,830
But they are high above.

44
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,410
I can hardly see them.

45
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,000
How can I take my revenge?

46
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,700
Actually, that's not the case.

47
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,540
The Crown Prince and the Empress

48
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,370
are just ordinary people.

49
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:07,910
Didn't you see

50
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,750
the Crown Prince a few days ago?

51
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,370
On your wedding night,

52
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,120
you saw his frivolous behavior.

53
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,040
How can he govern the country well

54
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,580
and be a good king?

55
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,870
Then look at her.

56
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,160
See if you can smile or not.

57
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,750
It's him.

58
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,120
Yes, it's him.

59
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,000
So,

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,040
the Emperor,

61
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,500
Empress, and Crown Prince

62
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,540
are all just ordinary people.

63
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,830
According to what you said,

64
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,460
more innocent people

65
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,500
will die for us.

66
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,250
Haven't enough people died for you already?

67
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,120
Back then, Zhao Li died for you.

68
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,000
Just now,

69
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,200
Zhu Dabao also died for you.

70
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,080
You are the prince.

71
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,250
Only you can change this world.

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,540
Only you can avenge us.

73
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,250
Your Highness, I'm willing to follow you

74
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,460
to restore order in the court
and rid the Emperor of improper advice.

75
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,380
I am willing

76
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,620
to die to atone for my sins.

77
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,450
Your wound just healed.

78
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,490
No drinking.

79
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,370
Just one or two cups. It's fine.

80
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,620
Do you really not want to be the Emperor?

81
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
If I wanted to,

82
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,000
I wouldn't be here.

83
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,660
What if

84
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,870
I want you to be?

85
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,090
Jun Mo!

86
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,330
I'll fetch the doctor.

87
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,460
Don't.

88
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,410
There's poison in the wine.

89
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,910
The one who poisoned it is among us.

90
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,290
Prepare a bath.

91
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,160
I need to detox.

92
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,750
Alright.

93
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,210
Yao,

94
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,160
go out first.

95
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,170
What?

96
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,040
I need to take off my clothes.

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,160
I'll help you.

98
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,290
Jun Mo, don't leave.

99
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,700
I'll always help you undress from now on.

100
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,200
I won't leave, okay?

101
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,630
Okay.

102
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,830
Don't worry.

103
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,500

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,330

106
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,380

108
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,910
