with you for money.

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,260
Actually, I can do it.

19
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,160
Zuo Xiachan,

20
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,800
do you know what you're saying?

21
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,080
Easy for you to say.

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,120
You!

23
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,260
Actually, I don't care about money.

24
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,910
It's just

25
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,600
I quite like him.

26
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,760
Did you forget what she just said?

27
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,250
What's the use

28
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,390
of getting my body?

29
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,290
Mountains can be climbed.

30
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,480
Seas can be crossed.

31
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,330
Mountains and seas can be leveled.

32
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,620
Shut up.

33
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,180
You can make everything sensible.

34
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
Mountains can be broken. Seas can be leveled.

35
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,640
What about the human heart?

36
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,220
You killed my master,

37
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,160
but you didn't get his heart.

38
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,960
Actually, I don't care about the heart.

39
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,050
Having the mountain is enough.

40
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,290
Mountains come in thousands.

41
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,750
Trees come in billions.

42
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,370
Every mountain is different.

43
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,910
Every tree's heart is hard to guess.

44
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,390
Jun Mo, you've lost.

45
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,760
You're the one who lost.

46
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,220
Mother,

47
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,430
hit more accurately.

48
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,180
The Emperor has arrived.

49
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,500
Li Wei, you've come.

50
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,180
Xiaoren, I've gone to get help.

51
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,800
Now you can stand up straight.

52
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,180
Your Majesty.

53
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,600
What I say matters less and less.

54
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,600
Empress, stop.

55
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,040
You are jealous and incompetent.

56
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,910
You don't know how to rule.

57
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,640
Why can you hold power?

58
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,660
You killed Zhao Li.

59
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,500
Guards.

60
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,640
Silence her.

61
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,620
Do you think

62
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,910
I relied on Flash Sect

63
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,290
to eliminate my opponents?

64
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,750
Flash Sect was founded by me.

65
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,830
The current Chief

66
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,760
is just a puppet.

67
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,220
Jun Mo.

68
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,300
What does she mean?

69
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,280
Who did she eliminate?

70
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,870
Sixteen years ago,

71
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,540
she framed Zhao Li

72
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,700
and had Mo Wei

73
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,410
and the Twelve Generals kill my father.

74
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,410
What?

75
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,870
She framed General Zhao?

76
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,260
Stop pretending.

77
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,450
Zhao Li was innocent.

78
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,960
Did you not know?

79
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,160
You just used me

80
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,700
to get rid of him.

81
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,640
You're lying.

82
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,050
I truly didn't know

83
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,100
General Zhao was innocent.

84
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,300
Jun Mo.

85
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,660
Though Empress Xiao

86
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,870
killed your mother,

87
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,750
he permitted

88
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,760
and tolerated it.

89
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,850
Who do you think deserves to die more?

90
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,800
Both deserve to die.

91
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,800
Jun Mo.

92
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,410
My son,

93
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,550
I also grieved

94
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,390
your mother's death.

95
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,750
At that time,

96
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,050
I was threatened by Empress Xiao.

97
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,180
I had to listen to her.

98
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,370
I thought after her death,

99
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,080
the palace would be peaceful.

100
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,430
But this woman

101
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,680
is much more vicious than Empress Xiao.

102
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,180
Father,

103
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,680
stop talking.

104
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,970
Empress Xiao

105
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,010
was killed by me.

106
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,600
What did you say?

107
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,760
Your Majesty, did you hear that?

108
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,890
A nine-year-old child

109
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,960
could kill.

110
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,290
Is there anything wrong

111
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,600
with avenging his mother?

112
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,600
What does age have to do with it?

113
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,040
Zhao Xiaoren,

114
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,600
you poisoned me.

115
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,640
A few days ago, I returned to Flash Sect.

116
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,080
I first took the most poisonous poison

117
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,660
from the Poison Queen,

118
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,390
then entered the poison miasma,

119
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,800
and finally,

120
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,120
got bitten

121
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,500
by an unknown

122
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,640
venomous snake.

123
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,760
So now my blood

124
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,600
is all poison.

125
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,830
You're done for.

126
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,960
The Poison Queen said

127
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,470
her blood is more poisonous than Seven Deadly.

128
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,640
Mother, save me.

129
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,910
Don't call me Mother.

130
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,830
My son has long been dead.

131
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,850
You're just a substitute.

132
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,020
No wonder

133
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,620
you always

134
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,340
beat me.

135
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,740
You really aren't her biological child.

136
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,780
So dramatic.

137
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,460
Yao!

138
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,960
Yao!

139
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,140
Yao!

140
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:04,950
Yao!

141
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,300
She must have taken her back to Flash Sect.

142
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,540
That's the only place she can go.

143
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,540
She's looking for the Poison Queen
to cure the poison.

144
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,020
Then we will level Flash Sect.

145
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,620
Zhao Xiaoren

146
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,980
has truly made me lucky.

147
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,930
She helped me find such good poison.

148
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,780
Poison Queen.

149
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,660
You haven't returned for years.

150
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,820
I'm poisoned.

151
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,180
Cure me.

152
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,500
Let me see.

153
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,220
Injured by Zhao Xiaoren?

154
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,580
Yes.

155
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,820
Can you cure it?

156
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,380
Not before today.

157
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,380
What do you mean?

158
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,420
Because today

159
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,380
I captured this one.

160
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,300
Finally scared you.

161
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,300
My inner strength can't hold on.

162
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,460
I can only keep you alive

163
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,660
For at least three days,

164
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,940
do not use your inner strength.

165
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,780
What if I insist on using it?

166
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,180
Then you'll only live for three days.

167
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,820
Alright.

168
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,180
I'll listen to you.

169
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,420
I'll stay here for three days.

170
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,180
Guard me for three days,

171
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,500
and I'll give you anything you want.

172
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,340
Really?

173
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,420
I won't go back on my word.

174
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,780
I want a man.

175
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,100
We might die.

176
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,260
If we survive,

177
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,260
can I be

178
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,540
your second wife?

179
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,780
No.

180
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,300
Can I be

181
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,620
Xiaoren's second husband?

182
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,700
No.

183
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,940
No, no.

184
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,780
Are all Flash Sect people

185
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,180
unafraid of anything?

186
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,180
We're used to it.
