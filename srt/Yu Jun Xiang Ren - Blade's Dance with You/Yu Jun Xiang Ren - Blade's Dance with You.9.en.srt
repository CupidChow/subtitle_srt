26
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,740
there are things I must clarify.

00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,180
Xiaoren.

28
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,100
I wondered why I couldn't find you.

29
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,420
Turns out you are all here.

30
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,340
Xiachan,

31
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,460
please help me convince her

32
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,620
to come with us

33
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,580
and wander the martial world.

34
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,860
Why?

35
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,980
It's clear she doesn't like you.

36
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,380
If you ask me,

37
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,220
you should kill her and take the credit.

38
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,420
Xiachan.

39
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,100
She won't survive.

40
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,020
Even if she killed Jun Mo now,

41
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,300
Flash Sect won't let her go.

42
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,220
That's the rule.

43
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,180
But we can run away.

44
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,820
I won't go with you.

45

I didn't dare.

99
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,900
Why?

100
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,220

102
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,540

and Mo Wei conspiring

Don't look. It's all evidence.

00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,860
Let me see.

159
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,940
Why are some pages missing?

160
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,580
I don't know.

161
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,300
It was like this when I got it.

162
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,260
As a child, I was curious

163
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,580
why you always threw stones into the water.

164
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,380
Because of my mother.

165
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,060
Your mother?

166
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,580
My mother had a gentle nature.

167
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,700
Whenever she was upset,

168
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,500
she would go to the river to skip stones.

169
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,940
Later, she took me with her.

170
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,500
Skip stones?

171
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,900
But I remember

172
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,300
you always just threw stones

173
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,580
into the river.

174
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,380
Because I couldn't do it right.

175
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,860
I could never get the strength right.

176
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,420
My mother would laugh at me

177
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,660
when she saw it.

178
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,060
So,

179
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,460
you always failed

180
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,860
to make your mother happy.

181
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,260
These years,

182
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,900
I've been searching for Master's body

183
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,860
and looking for you.

184
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,380
But there was no news.

185
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,100
I was saved

186
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,220
and later joined Flash Sect.

187
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,780
I thought

188
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,580
you were dead too.

189
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,500
This is Master's jade pendant.

190
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,940
I found it

191
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,500
after the avalanche.

192
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,620
Father.

193
