=Episode 16=

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,300
An assassin

17
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,010
confessed his master so soon.

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,370
Don't you find that irrational?

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,290
Even scripts wouldn't have such a plot.

20
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,410
You're still alive?

21
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,010
It was you who poisoned me.

22
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,580
Indeed, I poisoned you.

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,180
His Majesty treated me with great kindness.

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,320
As a prince,

25
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,010
you want to kill the Emperor and rebel.

26
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,370
You deserve death.

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,260
Maybe he's just old and confused.

28
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,860
He is indeed old

29
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,470
and has no martial arts skills.

30
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,180
Your performance was also too clumsy.

31
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,680
Mr. Fu said he saw me

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,970
drink the poisoned wine.

33
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,690
That's true. I drank it,

34
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,800
but

35
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,100
given his age, if he peeks at me,

36
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,760
I would have noticed.

37
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,080
So it can be inferred

38
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,770
the person peeking at me was you.

39
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,440
Now that you know everything,

40
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,820
why are you still asking me?

41
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,820
Why did you approach me?

42
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,100
You'll have to ask her.

43
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,690
Her?

44
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,650
Who is she?

45
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,860
You're not worthy of knowing her.

46
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,180
She's the most perfect person in this world.

47
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,370
Do you know what this is?

48
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,030
No.

49
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,560
It's a promise.

50
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,770
An empty promise for you.

51
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,260
The person you mentioned

52
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,150
only gave you an empty promise,

53
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,010
and she'll never fulfill it.

54
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,040
You don't understand her at all.

55
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,150
Only I do.

56
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,100
You understand nothing.

57
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,680
Someone who doesn't like you

58
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,280
won't feel anything

59
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,370
no matter how hard you try.

60
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,620
The idiot's enlightened.

61
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,040
You're talking nonsense.

62
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,980
That's enough.

63
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,060
No need to explain further.

64
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,770
You need to pay the price

65
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,510
for what you've done.

66
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,490
The price?

67
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,620
Then kill me.

68
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,260
Death

69
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,650
is not so easy.

70
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,900
Mr. Zhu.

71
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,210
Thanks, Mr. Jun Mo,

72
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,720
for finding the killer

73
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,370
who killed my son.

74
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,210
That's right.

75
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,420
I killed that pig.

76
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,910
You hurry and kill me

77
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,120
to avenge him.

78
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,370
Dream on.

79
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,440
My son took a liking to you.

80
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,900
It's your blessing.

81
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,780
I'm going to let you lie beside my son

82
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,210
to accompany him.

83
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,280
What are you saying?

84
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,560
You must marry him

85
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,770
and accompany him.

86
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,370
You can't do this.

87
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,010
Zhao Xiaoren,

88
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,510
let me go.

89
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,260
Let me go. I'll tell you.

90
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,820
Dragon Pill, right?

91
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,070
I know where to get it.

92
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,650
Don't worry about it.

93
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,430
Take her away.

94
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,680
Let go of me.

95
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,610
Move.

96
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,890
I'm not going.

97
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,210
- Let go.
- Behave yourself.

98
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,370
You're awake.

99
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,320
This is the medicine given by Physician Liu.

100
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,700
Drink it.

101
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,370
Okay.

102
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,300
So bitter.

103
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,980
Candied fruit.

104
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,980
How dare you bite me?

105
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,510
So majestic outside,

106
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,100
you're acting like a child at home.

107
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,170
Last time when I fed you medicine,

108
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,510
you bit me.

109
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,680
Do you still remember?

110
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,980
You dare say that to me?

111
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,870
I'll bite you again.

112
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,590
Okay.

113
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,680
I'll bite you if you don't.

114
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,610
How dare you?

115
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,610
Try me.

116
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,020
"Our union doth shine brighter than gold;

117
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,210
our bond shall endure 'til the end of days."

118
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,420
What does that mean?

119
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,650
It means I want to be with you.

120
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,980
I'm going to go back to Flash Sect

121
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,980
and steal the Dragon Pill.

122
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,820
No, it's too dangerous.

123
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,700
Don't worry. I'm fine now.

124
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,510
I just coughed up blood to make Chen Yuan

125
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,890
relax her vigilance.

126
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,420
She should have sent the message
back to Flash Sect.

127
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,960
Flash Sect won't act in the near future.

128
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,100
I'll have more time

129
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,650
to prepare other things.

130
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,720
How about

131
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,840
trying ice water detoxification again?

132
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,980
Let Mo Wei give you inner strength.

133
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,610
No need.

134
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,170
The inner strength you gave me just now

135
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,100
is already enough.

136
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,280
What nonsense are you talking about?

137
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,750
Do you believe I'll bite you?

138
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,700
I don't believe it.

139
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,100
Try me.

140
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,510
Are all the things ready?

141
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,450
Xiaoren,

142
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,280
I've tampered with this rope.

143
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,510
As long as you exert a little force,

144
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,580
you can break free.

145
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,200
And take this.

146
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,980
Use the method I taught you.

147
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,300
Just mention me when you see her.

148
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,610
Okay.

149
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,370
What are you two talking about?

150
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,760
Nothing.

151
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,600
Let's go.

152
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,880
Earth Killer Zuo Xiachan

153
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,580
brought Zhao Xiaoren back.

154
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,820
Let me see if she's real.

155
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,280
Ms. Qiu,

156
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,480
you're just a gatekeeper.

157
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,420
Not qualified to check.

158
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,200
A few days ago,

159
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,170
my old man died by her hands.

160
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,770
Why can't I check?

161
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,280
You two have been pretending for twenty years.

162
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,860
He died, and you probably woke up
laughing in your dreams.

163
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,400
You do understand me.

164
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,910
The Chief gave me three hundred taels of silver

165
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,070
to bury him properly.

166
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,010
Disgusting!

167
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,750
Stop talking and open the door.

168
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,570
We're here to see the Chief for a reward.

169
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,810
The Chief has ordered

170
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,420
Zhao Xiaoren must be verified before entering.

171
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,420
When was this order issued?

172
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,010
The day before yesterday.

173
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,210
Fine. Verify her.

174
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,770
Take a good look.

175
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,620
It's her, right?

176
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,010
This is the Main Altar.

177
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,550
Only Celestial Killers

178
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,420
are allowed to enter.

179
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,200
Even Celestial Killers

180
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,770
cannot move around freely.

181
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,000
Be careful.

182
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,980
I'm not familiar with many places here either.

183
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,250
Where are we going now?

184
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,300
To find the Poison Queen.

185
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,280
Aren't we looking for the Dragon Pill?

186
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,670
Why find the Poison Queen?

187
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,480
Anyone who uses poison can also detoxify it.

188
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,150
Otherwise, they could easily poison themselves.

189
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,030
Are you saying

190
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,180
the Dragon Pill was refined
by the Poison Queen?

191
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,510
Less talk. Let's go.

192
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,180
The Poison Queen should be awake by now.

193
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:13,960
A scorpion.

194
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,810
We're almost there.

195
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,600
What are you doing?

196
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,360
The Poison Queen is surrounded
by poisonous insects.

197
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,280
This was given to me by Li Wei.

198
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,210
Insect repellent powder.

199
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,280
Why didn't he give it to me?

200
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,500
Stop spreading it and save some for me.

201
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,570
What are you doing?

202
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,350
A woman's face is very important.

203
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,650
I don't want to get bitten.

204
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,400
Zhao Xiaoren,

205
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,570
why does my face feel itchy?

206
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,910
Stop scratching.

207
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,570
You look super beautiful now.

208
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,000
Really?

209
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,550
Then I'm relieved.

210
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,570
Who dares to enter my territory?

211
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,240
We're friends of Li Wei

212
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,770
here to ask the Poison Queen for help.

213
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,180
You...

214
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,060
