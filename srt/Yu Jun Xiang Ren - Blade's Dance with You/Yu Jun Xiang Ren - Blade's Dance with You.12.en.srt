Ran!

18
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,000
Ran!

19
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,870
I really didn't

20
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,620
conspire with Mo Wei

21
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,540
to frame Master.

22
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,620
I believe you. I believe you.

23
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,540
Ran, don't die.

24
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,500
Don't die.

25
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,540
Ran...

26
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,960
Don't cry.

27
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,700
Sixteen years ago,

28
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,500
I couldn't save Master.

29
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,620
Now,

30
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,200
I can finally save you.

31
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,660
Stop talking.

32
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,950
Stop talking.

33
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,700
Ran... Ran...

34
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,450
Ran...

35
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,790
How could this happen?

36
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,390
Ran...

37
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,630
Wake up.

38
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,250
Jun Mo.

39
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,960
Jun Mo.

40
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,580
You're awake.

41
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,870
Am I dead?

42
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,880
No.

43
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,450
How could you be dead?

44
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,500
Yao,

45
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,830
I will get to the bottom

46
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,330
of Master's case.

47
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,370
Why did you kill my father?

48
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,120
By order of His Majesty.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,040
Zhao Li committed treason,

50
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,080
intending to rebel.

51
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,290
The evidence was conclusive.

52
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,630
Nonsense.

53
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,450
My father would never committed treason.

54
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,950
Where did the evidence

55
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,450
of Master's treason come from?

56
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,080
From Zuo Feng,

57
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,590
a Censor.

58
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,290
Where is he now?

59
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,870
He died

60
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,950
sixteen years ago.

61
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,750
So there's no evidence left.

62
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,450
I saw you kill my father.

63
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,250
What more can you say?

64
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,790
I'm old now.

65
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,410
I can't kneel any longer.

66
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,700
I've knelt my whole life.

67
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,410
Now, I can finally

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,660
stand up straight

69
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,540
and speak

70
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,160
my mind.

71
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,950
You deserve to die on your knees.

72
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,420
Yao.

73
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,660
Let's hear what else he has to say.

74
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,260
Yao,

75
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,580
actually,

76
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,620
I've watched you grow up.

77
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,860
Today, you can listen to me

78
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,980
tell the story of the past.

79
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,500
Back then, in the Imperial City,

80
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,020
there were Twelve Generals.

81
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,540
Your father, Zhao Li,

82
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,980
was their leader.

83
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,380
After Zhao Li

84
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,060
quelled the rebellion in the northwest,

85
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,500
he was highly revered.

86
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,900
Many court officials

87
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,500
would kneel to him.

88
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,700
(Taiji Hall)

89
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,580
Welcome back with victory, General.

90
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:10,420
Welcome back with victory, General.

91
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,100
General,

92
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,700
you must not do this.

93
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,100
I kneel to you, General.

94
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,540
We can't be without you.

95
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,900
Please think it over, General.

96
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,460
Zhao Li knew

97
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,740
his merit had exceeded the Emperor's,

98
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,100
so he retired and returned to the countryside,

99
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,460
handing over his military power.

100
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,220
Your Majesty,

101
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,300
I, Zhao Li, have fulfilled my mission

102
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,540
and quelled the northwest rebellion.

103
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,020
This can guarantee the stability

104
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,820
of our Kingdom for a hundred years.

105
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,820
Good.

106
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,980
How would you like me

107
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,660
to reward you?

108
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,820
Please give me a good land of a hundred mu,

109
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,580
so I can retire

110
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,060
and enjoy family life with my daughter.

111
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,900
General, you are in your prime.

112
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,420
Why not continue to serve me?

113
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,300
Your Majesty, I am just a sword

114
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,220
in your hand.

115
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,460
Now that the world is at peace

116
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,620
and the people live in safety.

117
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,420
Your Majesty, you can

118
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,340
put the sword away now.

119
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,060
If one day,

120
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,860
there is an external threat again,

121
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,230
I will

122
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,420
fight to the death.

123
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,260
Good.

124
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,900
Then I will make you Grand Tutor,

125
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,580
grant you a good land of a thousand mu,

126
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,980
and allow you free access to the Palace.

127
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,540
Thank you, Your Majesty.

128
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,420
But no one expected

129
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,860
that just two years later,

130
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,220
the northwest rebelled again.

131
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,260
Rumors spread in the Palace,

132
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,300
and His Majesty received a secret report

133
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,500
from Censor Zuo Feng,

134
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,820
detailing evidence

135
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,420
of Zhao Li's treason and intent to rebel.

136
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,340
Zhao Li conspired with enemy states to rebel.

137
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,500
Zhao Li conspired with enemy states to rebel.

138
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,620
Zhao Li conspired with enemy states to rebel.

139
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,660
Outrageous!

140
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,580
Master.

141
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,500
Master, please stop.

142
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,300
If you continue, many people will die.

143
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,100
The Seventh Prince came willingly

144
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,460
to persuade you to surrender.

145
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,540
Ran, come here quickly.

146
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,940
- Master!
- Father!

147
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,580
Zhao Li,

148
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,260
you conspired with foreign tribes

149
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,840
to rebel against the state.

150
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,380
This is a capital crime.

151
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,660
Nonsense.

152
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,700
If my father wanted to rebel,

153
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,300
why would he hand over his military power?

154
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,420
If even you can think of this,

155
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,260
don't you think

156
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,340
the Emperor also considered it?

157
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,420
If His Majesty knew,

158
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,820
why did he still want to kill my father?

159
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,260
If a sword is too sharp,

160
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,060
it might cut its owner.

161
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,620
If Zhao Li were

162
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,660
to regain military power

163
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,420
and achieve military success,

164
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,380
not only the common people,

165
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,780
but even court officials

166
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,060
would support him.

167
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,980
At that time,

168
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,380
whether Zhao Li wanted it or not,

169
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,740
someone would elevate him

170
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,380
and even

171
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,500
make him the Emperor.

172
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,620
Nonsense.

173
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,780
These are Zhao Li's two-year notes,

174
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,210
detailing evidence
of the Empress eliminating dissidents

175
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,580
to secure the Crown Prince's position.

176
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:12,860
Xiachan.

177
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,580
You stole my father's notebook.

178
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,980
This

179
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,300
is the last straw

180
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,740
that broke the camel's back.

181
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,380
If His Majesty didn't fear Zhao Li,

182
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,500
who

183
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,300
could've shaken Zhao Li's position?

184
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,180
Then

185
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,700
were the deaths of officials recorded in it

186
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,780
sanctioned by the Emperor?

187
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
Of course not.

188
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,500
The court's internal strife

189
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,490
was no less brutal than the battlefield.

190
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,210
The officials who were killed

191
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,940
were not the Crown Prince's supporters.

192
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,300
So,

193
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,380
they died because they

194
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,660
backed the wrong side?

195
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,860
Now, all the royal sons,

196
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,820
except for the Crown Prince
and the Seventh Prince,

197
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,460
have mysteriously died.

198
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,300
For the past ten years,

199
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,660
no concubine

200
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,860
dared to give birth to a son,

201
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,060
fearing it would bring death.

202
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,540
And now,

203
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,740
the only true royal sons

204
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,620
are the Crown Prince

205
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,020
and the Seventh Prince.

206
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,860
The throne

207
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,300
means nothing to me.

208
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,500
If it weren't for you,

209
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,220
Zhao Li wouldn't have died.

210
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,340
Those who wanted to make you the Emperor

211
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,540
wouldn't have died either.

212
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,940
Father.

213
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,980
My father wanted Jun Mo to be the Emperor.

214
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,180
