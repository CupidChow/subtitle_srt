00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,619
(This is a work of fiction. All characters, places, incidents,)

2
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,051
(and organizations portrayed in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:19,561
I...

4
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:22,661
did something wrong.

5
00:00:24,131 --> 00:00:27,329
The savings bank corruption scandal 15 years ago.

6
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,940
The investigation was led by Choi Tae Guk.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,709
The person who introduced...

8
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,140
the illegal loan broker to the CEO of the savings bank.

9
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:37,140
That was me.

10
00:00:37,581 --> 00:00:40,210
The broker paid me in return.

11
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:42,450
When the investigation began,

12
00:00:42,451 --> 00:00:44,389
I went to see Choi Tae Guk and got down on my knees.

13
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,820
I begged him for help.

14
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,491
I begged him on my knees like a pathetic loser.

15
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:51,890
Don't tell me that was the reason...

16
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:56,831
you did nothing when you knew they should be investigated as suspects.

17
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,470
For all those years,

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,140
you kept your silence as if you were dead?

19
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,140
I needed money.

20
00:01:08,241 --> 00:01:10,310
I wanted to buy a house so Eun Seo and her mother...

21
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:13,081
could live there together.

22
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:17,221
Now, you're telling me all this and listing ridiculous excuses.

23
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,691
And what? We should catch them together?

24
00:01:24,021 --> 00:01:26,661
Someone was already framed for it once.

25
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:30,200
You think we can catch them when there's no evidence?

26
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,771
Help me.

27
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,710
You're on your knees again?

28
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,650
You are pathetic.

29
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,350
Clearly, you can do this whenever you need to.

30
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,191
The next time you kneel down, who will it be for?

31
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,420
Catching those scumbags is all I care about.

32
00:01:53,421 --> 00:01:56,559
I'll get down on my knees a hundred times...

33
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,230
if we can catch those jerks.

34
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:00,760
Han Dong O, Lee Si Hyuk,

35
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,460
and Choi Ju Wan.

36
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:12,141
We must get them.

37
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:14,141
Together, we can catch them!

38
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,351
Soo Jae!

39
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,630
That's why I bought that house.

40
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,370
That day, they must have left some traces behind.

41
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,801
I will find it, no matter what.

42
00:02:41,571 --> 00:02:42,601
Traces.

43
00:02:48,611 --> 00:02:50,939
- That part-timer was... - Are you okay?

44
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,149
- Kim Dong Gu's younger sister. - Can I borrow your cell phone?

45
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,779
She was Jeon Na Jung.

46
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,421
My cell phone? Okay.

47
00:02:58,821 --> 00:03:00,220
Wait here.

48
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,160
Hey! Where is this wench?

49
00:03:04,491 --> 00:03:06,861
Han Dong O, Lee Si Hyuk, Choi Ju Wan.

50
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,660
They kidnapped Eun Seo,

51
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,370
but she ended up in an accident.

52
00:03:14,071 --> 00:03:17,241
And Jeon Na Jung witnessed everything.

53
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,271
So they couldn't just let her go.

54
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:22,210
Who's that girl? She saw everything.

55
00:03:22,581 --> 00:03:24,081
Hey, get her!

56
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,051
Knowing their fathers...

57
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,590
Especially Choi Tae Guk, who was a chief prosecutor back then,

58
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:39,460
wouldn't have had any problem framing...

59
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,801
Kim Dong Gu for the crime his son and his son's friends committed.

60
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,071
Wait for me there.

61
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll follow you as soon as I wrap things up here.

62
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,220
I can't believe I fell for such a scumbag.

63
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:09,291
(Episode 13)

64
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,870
(Choi Yoon Sang)

65
00:04:28,411 --> 00:04:30,711
Soo Jae, I need to talk to you. It's about Chan.

66
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:31,880
Pick up.

67
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,791
Yoon Sang, what are you doing?

68
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:42,461
Kim Dong Gu.

69
00:04:44,361 --> 00:04:45,991
You deceived Soo Jae.

70
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:48,901
And Soo Jae gave up on you.

71
00:04:50,361 --> 00:04:52,370
(Choi Yoon Sang)

72
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:54,101
Soo Jae...

73
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,171
gave up on you.

74
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,040
You still don't see it?

75
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,410
(Soo Jae)

76
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:02,010
Soo Jae gave up on you during that trial!

77
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,911
Because it was a complete defeat for her,

78
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,320
she was able to join TK Law Firm and work under my father.

79
00:05:08,481 --> 00:05:09,721
What?

80
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,820
What are you talking about?

81
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,861
What is this about? Tell me everything you know.

82
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,059
Her mother and brothers were arrested at that time.

83
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,330
And she was offered a deal.

84
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,560
Through her mentor, Director Baek,

85
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:28,341
she was told not to waste her effort on Kim Dong Gu's trial.

86
00:05:29,101 --> 00:05:31,200
Then her family would be released.

87
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:33,310
Don't give me this nonsense...

88
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,180
unless you can be responsible for it.

89
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,580
This is why...

90
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:44,151
you and Soo Jae can't work out.

91
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:46,721
You deceived Soo Jae.

92
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:49,861
And she gave up on you.

93
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,401
I don't care.

94
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,531
I don't care.

95
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,671
If she had to give up on me to save her family,

96
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:05,041
she made the right decision. She should have done that...

97
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:07,911
because I would've done the same.

98
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:09,810
Stop lying to yourself.

99
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,351
Do you think using that logic to justify her decision...

100
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,020
would make everything go away?

101
00:06:16,721 --> 00:06:17,721
You think I'm lying?

102
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:20,890
The whole world deemed me the culprit.

103
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:23,221
And even my own father didn't believe me.

104
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,630
Do you know how miserable that makes you feel?

105
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:29,860
Professor Oh was the only person who believed me...

106
00:06:29,861 --> 00:06:30,861
when I was in misery.

107
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,231
You probably don't know that feeling.

108
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,901
Hearing how someone believed me...

109
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,911
helped me breathe and keep living.

110
00:06:40,411 --> 00:06:42,010
You can't even imagine that.

111
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,111
You got framed because you let people walk all over you.

112
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:48,580
People use you because you let people walk all over you!

113
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,950
So what?

114
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:52,921
Someone believed me.

115
00:06:53,921 --> 00:06:55,291
That's all I need.

116
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,921
I don't care if she gave up on me...

117
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,291
at the trial.

118
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:02,200
You're crazy.

119
00:07:19,611 --> 00:07:21,079
(Oh Soo Jae, argued for my innocence, but lost)

120
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,520
(A lawyer at TK Law Firm)

121
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,890
(The one who believed me to the end)

122
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:33,560
You don't care?

123
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,861
You don't care, no matter what anybody does to you?

124
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:40,301
What about now? You still don't care?

125
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,041
(Soo Jae)

126
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,241
What did you do? What did you just do to Professor Oh?

127
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,080
Even now, you're worried about her?

128
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:53,351
I told you that she had betrayed you.

129
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:56,580
This...

130
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,620
really irks me.

131
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,869
(We're closed. Thank you.)

132
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,140
To tell you the truth,

133
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,450
I wondered if Professor Oh lost the trial...

134
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,221
because she gave up.

135
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,180
What? When?

136
00:08:30,781 --> 00:08:31,921
During the trial?

137
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,351
No, I had too much on my mind back then.

138
00:08:36,091 --> 00:08:37,561
When I was preparing for law school,

139
00:08:39,331 --> 00:08:42,760
I suddenly became curious and wanted to check my court records.

140
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:46,630
So you checked? Did you find anything strange?

141
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,500
The witnesses she brought in...

142
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,841
were discredited.

143
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,140
I tried to remember what happened at the trial.

144
00:08:55,341 --> 00:08:56,880
And I think...

145
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,780
she could tell at some point...

146
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,321
that she'd lose...

147
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,491
no matter what.

148
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:07,821
She knew she'd lose the trial.

149
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:10,321
So she did stab you in the back.

150
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,029
She ditched you.

151
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,331
If you're going to sit here and upset Chan, just go upstairs.

152
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,369
Hey, my blood is boiling right now.

153
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,799
I mean, are you okay with this? You must be angry too.

154
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,841
Hey! You little...

155
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,920
My life is...

156
00:09:46,361 --> 00:09:48,201
so pathetic, Jun Hee.

157
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:51,101
It's not your fault.

158
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,071
You did nothing wrong, so don't think like that.

159
00:09:57,201 --> 00:09:58,910
No, it is my fault.

160
00:10:01,711 --> 00:10:02,981
My decision...

161
00:10:03,941 --> 00:10:06,510
put Kim Dong Gu in pure torment.

162
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,280
And my choice...

163
00:10:11,451 --> 00:10:14,591
made me end up in the gutter.

164
00:10:17,861 --> 00:10:19,931
Yet I had no idea.

165
00:10:23,461 --> 00:10:25,300
I thought it'd lead me to a good place.

166
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,471
I'm so humiliated.

167
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,981
I sorely regret my decision.

168
00:10:45,221 --> 00:10:47,221
I'm really embarrassed.

169
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,211
Gosh.

170
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:09,741
Hey, Chan.

171
00:11:11,081 --> 00:11:13,311
You said Professor Oh heard...

172
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,420
your entire conversation with Yoon Sang earlier.

173
00:11:18,081 --> 00:11:20,550
Even if you tell her that it doesn't matter,

174
00:11:21,351 --> 00:11:23,321
she won't be able to face you.

175
00:11:25,961 --> 00:11:28,060
Of course not. How could she?

176
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:29,530
If I were her, I'd run away.

177
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,601
I wouldn't want to run into you ever again.

178
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:37,441
Everyone makes mistakes.

179
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:42,241
But once you get to know the person...

180
00:11:43,481 --> 00:11:47,611
Kim Dong Gu? What a mess.

181
00:11:49,081 --> 00:11:52,491
But I believe you.

182
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,920
Since I know that she's a good person,

183
00:11:58,831 --> 00:12:00,961
learning about her past mistakes...

184
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:04,931
won't change how I feel about her.

185
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,341
I already know what she's like.

186
00:12:09,201 --> 00:12:11,071
Of course, I won't change my mind easily.

187
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:12,841
That's how it is with us too, you know.

188
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:16,341
Even if we have wronged each other, it's okay.

189
00:12:17,841 --> 00:12:19,851
It's okay, indeed.

190
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:23,821
A little mistake is no big deal.

191
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:29,361
That's true. It doesn't matter.

192
00:12:44,841 --> 00:12:46,510
You didn't have to walk me out.

193
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:49,741
My goodness. You're smiling now?

194
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:57,920
Everyone has regrets.

195
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,851
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

196
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:04,660
You know there are jerks who should really be embarrassed.

197
00:13:04,821 --> 00:13:07,461
Make them experience the kind of humiliation they deserve.

198
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,400
Make them pay for what they did, no matter what.

199
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:13,530
That's what Oh Soo Jae would do, you know?

200
00:13:14,701 --> 00:13:16,370
That's what my friend, Oh Soo Jae, will do.

201
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,941
Oh, gosh.

202
00:13:31,481 --> 00:13:34,491
Professor Oh, you were right.

203
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:38,191
Mr. Ha's movements certainly overlap with yours.

204
00:13:39,091 --> 00:13:42,461
I managed to obtain some security footage. I'll send it to you now.

205
00:13:52,471 --> 00:13:54,340
He stood outside and listened to your entire lecture.

206
00:13:54,341 --> 00:13:56,410
When your students came out, he hid in the back.

207
00:13:58,341 --> 00:14:00,951
When he left the law school, he went straight to TK.

208
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:03,380
And since then, nothing suspicious yet.

209
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,390
Please continue to keep a close watch on him.

210
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:28,111
(Gong Chan)

211
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:34,280
What's up, at this hour?

212
00:14:34,681 --> 00:14:37,550
Let's just call it even.

213
00:14:39,721 --> 00:14:43,591
I didn't tell you that I was Kim Dong Gu.

214
00:14:43,861 --> 00:14:45,561
I wronged you too,

215
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:50,101
so let's call it even.

216
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,930
What?

217
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:54,300
I know Yoon Sang made you listen to our conversation last night.

218
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,870
You can't just let it go like that.

219
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,670
What I did to you was...

220
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:07,311
Just leave.

221
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,020
I don't care!

222
00:15:12,721 --> 00:15:16,491
I know what kind of person you are. So I don't care.

223
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,410
(Professor Oh Soo Jae)

224
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:44,221
You can come in.

225
00:15:45,221 --> 00:15:46,591
Let's talk inside.

226
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,170
I betrayed you.

227
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,510
You hid from me that you were Kim Dong Gu, but that's nothing.

228
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,340
What I did to you was...

229
00:16:09,341 --> 00:16:11,140
Director Baek told me everything.

230
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,780
I know who the real suspects are and who orchestrated everything.

231
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,221
Let's get them together.

232
00:16:21,221 --> 00:16:22,991
The scumbags who destroyed my life...

233
00:16:24,221 --> 00:16:26,530
and turned your life upside down.

234
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,561
Let's catch them together.

235
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,971
You should leave.

236
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,821
(Jeon Na Jung's clothes! That night!)

237
00:17:00,691 --> 00:17:03,331
(Suicide?)

238
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,470
(Someone deliberately framed Kim Dong Gu.)

239
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:10,599
(Choi Tae Guk, Seo Jun Myeong)

240
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,700
(Why did TK hire me after I lost Dong Gu's trial?)

241
00:17:11,701 --> 00:17:12,711
(Discredited all evidence and witnesses)

242
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,741
(Chairman Han's house in Samjung-dong? Traces?)

243
00:17:20,951 --> 00:17:22,381
I just scribbled some...

244
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,280
What is this?

245
00:17:26,151 --> 00:17:27,421
What is all this?

246
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:32,860
I heard Na Jung helped Director Baek's daughter...

247
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:35,131
that night.

248
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:40,270
What is his daughter's name?

249
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,070
Kang Eun Seo.

250
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,809
(Yoon Se Pil)

251
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,181
They have different surnames, but she is his daughter.

252
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,349
Kang Eun Seo got into a car accident that night.

253
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,221
She was brought into the hospital where Jun Hee worked as a resident,

254
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,550
wearing a convenience store uniform...

255
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:03,921
with a name tag that said "Jeon Na Jung".

256
00:18:06,231 --> 00:18:10,260
Jun Hee said it looked like something else...

257
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,901
had happened to Kang Eun Seo before the car accident occurred.

258
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,040
Then that was also...

259
00:18:18,401 --> 00:18:19,509
(Choi Ju Wan, Han Dong O, Lee Si Hyuk)

260
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,741
These scumbags...

261
00:18:22,181 --> 00:18:24,981
They did that to my sister, Na Jung.

262
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:31,921
(Jeon Na Jung, September 4, 2012)

263
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,830
She was a good girl.

264
00:18:51,641 --> 00:18:53,610
But I was never good to her.

265
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,381
I'm...

266
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:06,050
sorry.

267
00:19:09,221 --> 00:19:12,891
Whenever I thought of you, I felt so guilty.

268
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,070
But I tried to ignore it.

269
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,901
I thought that was the right thing to do...

270
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,010
because I was afraid I'd regret my decision.

271
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,350
I'm...

272
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:37,121
so...

273
00:19:38,451 --> 00:19:39,850
sorry.

274
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,790
Director Baek, I have a favour to ask.

275
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:27,401
I brought you all the info I've gathered on the incident.

276
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,770
Are we...

277
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,681
on the same side now?

278
00:20:36,981 --> 00:20:39,850
Not possible. We share the same goal, but that's it.

279
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,749
Let Director Baek know...

280
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,221
that he'll have to pay for being such a coward in the past.

281
00:20:47,221 --> 00:20:48,750
That's my condition.

282
00:21:01,371 --> 00:21:02,901
(Ungju Stepsister Murder Case)

283
00:21:04,871 --> 00:21:07,840
Are you serious? The prime suspects...

284
00:21:09,411 --> 00:21:11,711
were these three... I mean,

285
00:21:12,681 --> 00:21:14,451
these three scumbags?

286
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,250
We must find solid evidence,

287
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:21,520
although it won't be easy as a lot of time has passed.

288
00:21:22,151 --> 00:21:23,590
We must find it.

289
00:21:25,691 --> 00:21:26,860
One more thing.

290
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,789
The three of them aren't capable enough...

291
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,100
to handle anything on their own.

292
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,300
They were probably less capable ten years ago.

293
00:21:35,371 --> 00:21:37,500
And such people want to become the chairmen of a law firm...

294
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,441
and the chairmen of a conglomerate...

295
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,471
and the president of this country.

296
00:21:42,711 --> 00:21:45,110
And they messed up an innocent man's life...

297
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:47,881
and yours as well.

298
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,151
Are you all right?

299
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,621
No.

300
00:22:01,731 --> 00:22:04,701
(Lee In Soo will make our country fair and new.)

301
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,701
Yes. His approval ratings went up by seven percent over the weekend.

302
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,000
I have five interviews scheduled today.

303
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:14,539
That's amazing! You're wearing a nice outfit, right?

304
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,141
Go to a hair salon. Get your hair done too.

305
00:22:18,181 --> 00:22:19,681
I already did, of course.

306
00:22:20,211 --> 00:22:21,350
How are things with you?

307
00:22:21,481 --> 00:22:23,121
Is everything good in Yeongpyeong District?

308
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,990
Did the problem with the skeleton get sorted out?

309
00:22:26,991 --> 00:22:29,190
I just came back from the scene.

310
00:22:29,191 --> 00:22:30,721
Everything is going perfectly.

311
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,660
We're trying to identify the skeleton.

312
00:22:32,661 --> 00:22:34,589
The victim's family will probably show up.

313
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,201
I have nothing to worry about.

314
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,701
Oh, right.

315
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,830
When will Director Baek Jin Ki resign from the university?

316
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,070
Today is his last day.

317
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:46,871
He can just quietly resign on his last day.

318
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:49,480
But he's doing some kind of event today.

319
00:22:49,481 --> 00:22:50,539
(Wrongful imprisonment, confinement charge on the prosecutor...)

320
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,610
(who abused authority and framed the defendant)

321
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,651
(Victim, Kim)

322
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,549
- You're the victim. - You're the detective.

323
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,750
Nice. Great.

324
00:23:10,161 --> 00:23:13,170
The victim, Kim, suspected his wife to be unfaithful...

325
00:23:13,171 --> 00:23:15,401
and was arrested for murdering his wife with a hammer.

326
00:23:15,741 --> 00:23:17,999
The prosecutor in charge of the case, Han,

327
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,010
questioned the victim.

328
00:23:19,371 --> 00:23:21,211
And Kim was sentenced to a death penalty in court...

329
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:25,850
because all the evidence pointed Kim as the culprit.

330
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,981
Kim was wrongfully imprisoned.

331
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,451
But three years later,

332
00:23:30,651 --> 00:23:33,290
Choi who was serving time for aggravated robbery...

333
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,090
confessed to the crime, and Kim was acquitted of his crime.

334
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,961
And Kim sued Prosecutor Han who framed him as the culprit.

335
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:43,701
Defendant.

336
00:23:44,661 --> 00:23:48,500
How do you feel about Kim who was wrongfully imprisoned?

337
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,540
You'll think of the victim, Kim, as yourself.

338
00:23:51,741 --> 00:23:55,471
That's why you asked me that question.

339
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,410
That's right.

340
00:23:57,411 --> 00:24:01,411
You're just like Prosecutor Seo who framed me as the culprit.

341
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,151
It's unfortunate what happened to him.

342
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,790
Do you want to apologize to him?

343
00:24:09,221 --> 00:24:11,260
Not at all.

344
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:16,200
The survey confirmed that Candidate Lee's approval ratings...

345
00:24:16,201 --> 00:24:19,770
from the voters in their 20s and 30s increased over eight percent.

346
00:24:19,971 --> 00:24:22,099
His innovative housing policy which will target to benefit...

347
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,740
- the younger generation... - Policies for young people...

348
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:26,269
As the hearing is around the corner,

349
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,470
Director Baek Jin Ki, the nominee of the Minister of Justice position,

350
00:24:28,471 --> 00:24:30,279
will officially resign as the director...

351
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,510
of Seojung University Law School.

352
00:24:32,651 --> 00:24:33,980
As soon as Nominee Baek...

353
00:24:33,981 --> 00:24:36,221
resigns from Seojung University Law School...

354
00:24:39,221 --> 00:24:40,951
- Sir. - Yes?

355
00:24:41,491 --> 00:24:44,191
I got a call from Chief Legal Officer Han Gi Taek.

356
00:24:45,621 --> 00:24:46,690
(Recording, Han Gi Taek)

357
00:24:46,691 --> 00:24:48,760
The promise he made me before putting me here...

358
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,530
hasn't been fulfilled at all.

359
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:55,941
I'm not doing volunteer work here.

360
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
If he keeps this up,

361
00:24:57,801 --> 00:25:00,070
I don't know how much longer I can stay quiet.

362
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,411
Okay?

363
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,451
And do you think you won't be affected by this?

364
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,881
I could start talking at any minute.

365
00:25:11,921 --> 00:25:14,750
Relay this message to him. Got it?

366
00:25:15,391 --> 00:25:17,461
Gosh. That money-grubber.

367
00:25:18,221 --> 00:25:19,830
Tell him to wait quietly.

368
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:24,631
He's going to get his money when time is right.

369
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,971
Yes, sir.

370
00:25:28,631 --> 00:25:31,299
The victim's investigation and custody...

371
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,040
were carried out by legally sound processes.

372
00:25:34,941 --> 00:25:37,381
I would like to ask the witness who was considered the suspect.

373
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,509
During the questioning, was the prosecutor violent to you...

374
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:43,421
or did he coerce you to make a confession?

375
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,349
No.

376
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,049
During the trial,

377
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:50,421
did you feel that you were getting unfair treatment?

378
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,731
No one listened to my claim...

379
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,460
that I was innocent.

380
00:25:55,461 --> 00:25:58,260
No one believed me.

381
00:25:59,171 --> 00:26:00,871
No one believed me.

382
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,840
Of course. You kept changing your statement.

383
00:26:04,901 --> 00:26:06,570
You recanted your testimony.

384
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:10,211
Your recanted testimony drove you into the swamp.

385
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,141
But Professor Oh believed me.

386
00:26:14,481 --> 00:26:16,079
Right after the incident,

387
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,720
the victim was shocked from seeing his wife who was brutally murdered.

388
00:26:18,721 --> 00:26:20,590
So he was mentally unfit.

389
00:26:20,651 --> 00:26:23,590
He was arrested when he was mentally unfit.

390
00:26:23,921 --> 00:26:26,330
So the victim's mental state became more unstable.

391
00:26:26,731 --> 00:26:28,590
He suffered from visual and auditory hallucinations.

392
00:26:28,691 --> 00:26:32,231
So he made a false confession that he killed his wife.

393
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,430
Your Honour.

394
00:26:35,431 --> 00:26:36,700
The victim's mental state was examined...

395
00:26:36,701 --> 00:26:37,999
as per the victim's request.

396
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,440
But the medical expert cleared him as mentally sound.

397
00:26:40,441 --> 00:26:42,141
(Judge)

398
00:26:46,181 --> 00:26:47,710
(Student Mock Trial)

399
00:26:47,711 --> 00:26:50,221
(Judge)

400
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:58,520
It looks like we're interrupting your trial.

401
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,830
I apologize, Your Honour.

402
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,731
Gosh, no. It's all right, sir.

403
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:08,030
I thought about my parting gift to you.

404
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,799
And then inviting Mr. Choi Tae Guk, the chairman of the law firm,

405
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,211
the number one law firm you want to join, crossed my mind.

406
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:19,651
So I made a last-minute request, but he accepted my request.

407
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:33,290
Thank you for your warm welcome to this uninvited guest.

408
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:36,259
Then I think it's more fitting...

409
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,730
for Chairman Choi to take my seat.

410
00:27:38,731 --> 00:27:40,200
- Nice. - What do you think?

411
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:42,000
- Sounds good! - Yes!

412
00:27:51,641 --> 00:27:53,509
(Judge)

413
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,681
Prosecution.

414
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,721
You may question the witness.

415
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:01,019
Witness, when you were investigating the case,

416
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,590
you found the victim's car. What did you do then?

417
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,731
When a wife is murdered, the first suspect is the husband.

418
00:28:06,991 --> 00:28:09,560
I deemed it as a vehicle of the suspect, so I searched it.

419
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:11,631
I found a hammer in the trunk.

420
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,329
As you know, the deceased victim's blood...

421
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,270
and her husband's DNA were found on the hammer.

422
00:28:16,471 --> 00:28:18,640
That was enough to close the case. It was the perfect evidence.

423
00:28:18,641 --> 00:28:22,210
Witness, it wasn't perfect. That's why you're here.

424
00:28:22,211 --> 00:28:23,980
Do you still believe that?

425
00:28:23,981 --> 00:28:27,211
It was the perfect evidence during the investigation.

426
00:28:28,151 --> 00:28:30,050
He's the defendant now.

427
00:28:30,421 --> 00:28:34,350
But the then-prosecutor trusted the result of our investigation.

428
00:28:35,221 --> 00:28:36,721
(Judge)

429
00:28:38,621 --> 00:28:39,630
(Court in session)

430
00:28:39,631 --> 00:28:41,029
According to the analysis report from the NFS,

431
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:43,960
the hammer contained the deceased victim, Sim's blood,

432
00:28:43,961 --> 00:28:46,901
the victim, Kim's fingerprints and DNA,

433
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:50,201
and unidentified fingerprints.

434
00:28:50,971 --> 00:28:54,140
The defendant, the then-prosecutor, probably knew this fact.

435
00:28:54,141 --> 00:28:57,339
But to frame the victim as the culprit,

436
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:00,650
he didn't even check to whom the fingerprints belonged...

437
00:29:00,651 --> 00:29:03,221
and excluded the fingerprints from the investigation.

438
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,849
That's not true, Your Honour.

439
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,220
It was revealed that the unidentified fingerprints...

440
00:29:07,221 --> 00:29:09,019
belonged to the cop who found the hammer at the scene.

441
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,391
So there was no need to look into the fingerprints.

442
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,891
Objection, Your Honour.

443
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,631
There were more than one unidentified fingerprint.

444
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,329
Go ahead.

445
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:21,269
There was one more unidentified fingerprint...

446
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,599
other than the police officer's.

447
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,141
The fingerprint should have been identified.

448
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,671
But the prosecutor omitted it.

449
00:29:27,411 --> 00:29:30,911
So the innocent man, Kim, served miserable three years...

450
00:29:32,211 --> 00:29:34,881
in that cold prison cell.

451
00:29:37,481 --> 00:29:39,491
You guys covered up the unidentified fingerprint...

452
00:29:39,651 --> 00:29:41,421
from the knife.

453
00:29:42,121 --> 00:29:43,221
Defendant.

454
00:29:43,391 --> 00:29:47,090
Why did you omit the unidentified fingerprint from the investigation?

455
00:29:47,731 --> 00:29:49,431
Because it wasn't important.

456
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,661
The victim confessed to the crime during the questioning.

457
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,299
And the hammer had the victim's fingerprint.

458
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,540
Therefore, I requested an arrest warrant for the victim...

459
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,141
and demanded a death penalty in court.

460
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:04,040
I followed the law to proceed with the trial.

461
00:30:07,381 --> 00:30:10,320
How was it that the unidentified fingerprint wasn't important?

462
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,819
As a prosecutor,

463
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,350
you must identify all the fingerprints found on the weapon.

464
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,520
Did you not omit this important step to frame the victim as the culprit?

465
00:30:18,621 --> 00:30:20,461
That's slandering.

466
00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:22,089
I didn't do such a thing.

467
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,730
You should have identified to whom the fingerprint belonged.

468
00:30:24,731 --> 00:30:26,430
Why did you omit that?

469
00:30:26,431 --> 00:30:29,540
Because it wasn't important once the victim confessed!

470
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,839
Why are you making us repeat ourselves?

471
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,941
That's not what's happening here.

472
00:30:36,141 --> 00:30:38,381
Quiet.

473
00:30:41,151 --> 00:30:42,151
(Wrongful imprisonment, confinement charge on the prosecutor...)

474
00:30:42,151 --> 00:30:43,151
(who abused authority and framed the defendant)

475
00:30:43,152 --> 00:30:46,390
All right. What's your argument, Prosecution?

476
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:47,950
(Judge)

477
00:30:47,951 --> 00:30:51,320
What was improper about the investigation and the trial?

478
00:30:52,661 --> 00:30:54,559
The investigation wasn't proper.

479
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,360
In what ways was it not proper?

480
00:30:57,431 --> 00:30:59,130
The defendant fabricated an investigation report...

481
00:30:59,131 --> 00:31:01,829
to make it look like only the victim's fingerprint...

482
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,799
was found on the murder weapon.

483
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,000
He also wrote a false report that...

484
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,411
the police officer's fingerprint was found on the weapon.

485
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:10,340
He abused his authority and imprisoned the victim.

486
00:31:11,381 --> 00:31:13,881
This is a violation of Article 124.1 of of the Criminal Code.

487
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,981
Abuse of authority and confinement charge.

488
00:31:17,221 --> 00:31:18,320
Defendant.

489
00:31:19,181 --> 00:31:20,920
Is it true that you fabricated...

490
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,651
the investigation reports and statements?

491
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,921
No.

492
00:31:24,691 --> 00:31:27,759
The police officer accidentally touched the murder weapon...

493
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,000
and was worried that I might find his fingerprint on it.

494
00:31:30,631 --> 00:31:32,631
And I was worried that might become a problem,

495
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,730
so I received a statement from him to remove possible problems.

496
00:31:35,731 --> 00:31:38,600
That's why when unidentified fingerprints were found,

497
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,539
he thought they belonged to the police officer...

498
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,340
and didn't dig deeper.

499
00:31:42,671 --> 00:31:45,039
He didn't cover it up or tried to hide it.

500
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,380
Not digging deeper is the problem!

501
00:31:48,381 --> 00:31:49,819
I don't understand...

502
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,520
why you're arguing that it was a problem.

503
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,950
The murder weapon, the hammer,

504
00:31:53,951 --> 00:31:56,421
was found in the vehicle of the suspect who confessed.

505
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,491
And the suspect's fingerprint was found.

506
00:31:58,961 --> 00:32:00,190
That was enough evidence to confirm his confession...

507
00:32:00,191 --> 00:32:01,961
and prove that he was guilty of the crime.

508
00:32:03,661 --> 00:32:04,961
Don't you all agree?

509
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,471
What more would you need to see?

510
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,310
If you have obtained sufficient evidence,

511
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,310
the number of other fingerprints that were found...

512
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,981
doesn't matter, and you wouldn't even need to look into it.

513
00:32:33,631 --> 00:32:35,060
(Judge)

514
00:32:35,461 --> 00:32:37,231
I'll announce my ruling.

515
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:41,570
In conclusion, the suspect was innocent.

516
00:32:41,971 --> 00:32:45,000
The real culprit was someone else.

517
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:50,080
However, this was revealed through the culprit's confession.

518
00:32:50,881 --> 00:32:53,050
There's no evidence that indicates the defendant...

519
00:32:53,651 --> 00:32:56,620
abused his authority and arrested the suspect,

520
00:32:56,621 --> 00:32:57,980
knowing he was innocent.

521
00:32:57,981 --> 00:32:59,349
(Prosecution)

522
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,749
The law holds that it is better to have ten guilty persons escape...

523
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,621
than to have one innocent person suffer.

524
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,191
That is the principle the Criminal Procedure Act was built upon.

525
00:33:07,431 --> 00:33:11,100
Even if the suspect was initially found guilty...

526
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,530
but was exonerated later on as in this case,

527
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,371
we cannot hold the prosecution accountable...

528
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,411
and accuse them of abuse of authority...

529
00:33:21,671 --> 00:33:23,510
when there is no sufficient evidence...

530
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:27,450
for it will discourage the law enforcement agencies...

531
00:33:27,451 --> 00:33:29,721
from fully executing their rights and duties.

532
00:33:30,221 --> 00:33:34,289
Then, when they're not 100 percent sure,

533
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:37,221
they'll be hesitant to apprehend or charge suspects.

534
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,990
And in the long term, it will lead to social unrest...

535
00:33:40,991 --> 00:33:43,000
and cause more chaos.

536
00:33:44,901 --> 00:33:46,530
Most importantly, it seems that...

537
00:33:47,171 --> 00:33:50,599
the defendant did his best while investigating the case.

538
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,401
And I understand...

539
00:33:52,671 --> 00:33:56,711
why he decided not to investigate the unidentified fingerprints...

540
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,651
found on the murder weapon.

541
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:04,819
In addition, there is no evidence that the defendant...

542
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,390
deliberately tried to arrest the suspect,

543
00:34:07,391 --> 00:34:09,491
knowing that he was innocent.

544
00:34:10,691 --> 00:34:12,121
Ergo,

545
00:34:13,161 --> 00:34:15,291
the court finds the defendant not guilty.

546
00:34:15,391 --> 00:34:16,430
(Defence Counsel, Defendant)

547
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:17,530
(Prosecution)

548
00:34:21,831 --> 00:34:26,710
All right. Let's thank the presiding judge of the day,

549
00:34:26,741 --> 00:34:31,380
Mr. Choi Tae Guk of TK Law Firm, with a big round of applause.

550
00:34:31,581 --> 00:34:33,950
(Wrongful imprisonment, confinement charge on the prosecutor...)

551
00:34:33,951 --> 00:34:36,320
(who abused authority and framed the defendant)

552
00:34:54,331 --> 00:34:56,440
Don't worry about your confirmation hearing.

553
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:59,911
I'm counting on you, Chairman Choi.

554
00:35:01,311 --> 00:35:04,411
Thanks to you, I learned a lot and had a great time today.

555
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,730
You learned a lot?

556
00:35:45,081 --> 00:35:46,690
The trial is over.

557
00:35:46,951 --> 00:35:48,150
The case from ten years ago.

558
00:35:49,221 --> 00:35:52,320
The Ungju Stepsister Murder, also known as the Kim Dong Gu case.

559
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,859
Mr. Choi Tae Guk, you were the chief prosecutor...

560
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,900
of the prosecutors' office that handled the case.

561
00:35:57,161 --> 00:35:58,161
I have a question for you.

562
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,001
It was similar to the case we discussed at the mock trial.

563
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:05,771
Don't you already know what my answer will be?

564
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,669
From what I remember, Kim Dong Gu confessed to the crime,

565
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,581
and there was nothing wrong...

566
00:36:12,081 --> 00:36:13,811
with the investigation and the trial as well.

567
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,980
How did No Byung Chul end up becoming the culprit?

568
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,791
Who made him the culprit? And why did he die?

569
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,090
Why, just before his early release on parole?

570
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,291
Why are you asking me? You're barking up the wrong tree.

571
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:28,360
Someone framed Kim Dong Gu.

572
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,561
And as if that wasn't enough,

573
00:36:31,001 --> 00:36:34,101
No Byung Chul was also framed. Was it Prosecutor Seo Jun Myeong?

574
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,771
Or...

575
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:38,601
is there someone else behind him?

576
00:36:40,141 --> 00:36:41,210
Kim Dong Gu.

577
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,380
You see, if you were Kim Dong Gu...

578
00:36:46,811 --> 00:36:49,080
Ten years have passed, and No Byung Chul's guilt...

579
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:51,280
drove him to suicide.

580
00:36:52,721 --> 00:36:54,021
So now,

581
00:36:54,721 --> 00:36:56,860
what would you do if you were Kim Dong Gu?

582
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,460
I think he will find the culprit.

583
00:36:59,521 --> 00:37:01,360
The person who framed Kim Dong Gu.

584
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,629
The real culprit who framed No Byung Chul...

585
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,501
and got him killed.

586
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,471
He will be sure to find the real culprit.

587
00:37:09,201 --> 00:37:11,471
You think Kim Dong Gu would do that?

588
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:14,741
How foolish. That's such a shame.

589
00:37:15,771 --> 00:37:19,181
Foolishness always leads to tragedy.

590
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,851
If you ever meet Kim Dong Gu,

591
00:37:24,021 --> 00:37:25,521
make sure to tell him.

592
00:37:25,621 --> 00:37:27,791
If you happen to know who the culprit is, let him know...

593
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,291
that he will pay for messing with other people's lives.

594
00:37:41,601 --> 00:37:44,800
That brazen brat. How dare he stop my car?

595
00:37:45,741 --> 00:37:47,070
My apologies, sir.

596
00:37:47,971 --> 00:37:50,509
This time, I'll take care of him without a single mistake.

597
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,410
Leave him be. Let's see how cheeky he can get.

598
00:37:52,411 --> 00:37:54,210
It'll be fun to watch.

599
00:37:56,181 --> 00:37:58,751
If that punk acts up, so will Soo Jae.

600
00:37:59,851 --> 00:38:01,420
If I trample all over Soo Jae,

601
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,061
he'll lose that enthusiasm.

602
00:38:05,121 --> 00:38:07,360
It'll be entertaining to watch how it all unfolds.

603
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,161
(Director Baek Jin Ki)

604
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,501
Come in.

605
00:38:20,271 --> 00:38:21,411
Choi Yoon Sang.

606
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,741
You did a great job today.

607
00:38:25,181 --> 00:38:27,581
Chairman Choi was very satisfied with your argument.

608
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,420
Why did you organize such an event?

609
00:38:32,121 --> 00:38:33,851
With such designated roles.

610
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,391
I have a favour to ask.

611
00:38:38,661 --> 00:38:40,061
Chairman Choi Tae Guk.

612
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:42,931
I'd like to meet him.

613
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,799
Oh, that. I wanted to organize a mock trial as my parting gift,

614
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,800
instead of a useless resignation ceremony.

615
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:51,201
Exactly.

616
00:38:52,101 --> 00:38:53,940
Why did you pick a case like that...

617
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,010
and such roles for me and Chan?

618
00:38:58,911 --> 00:39:00,411
Is that what you're curious about?

619
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,210
Do you have an idea as to why I did such a thing?

620
00:39:05,951 --> 00:39:09,320
You really take after Chairman Choi.

621
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,161
But you're also quite different from him.

622
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,630
Because of that, I always felt bad for you.

623
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,830
You won't choose the easy way even though it's right before you.

624
00:39:17,831 --> 00:39:19,900
And you'll always be lonely.

625
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,501
I'm not quite following, sir.

626
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:27,440
When I heard you decided to leave the Legal Clinic Center...

627
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:30,640
to go intern at TK,

628
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:32,210
I was a little worried about you.

629
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:35,081
I wondered, "Why is he doing this?"

630
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,851
"Does he have a hidden agenda?"

631
00:39:39,581 --> 00:39:42,621
Of course, I had to make that choice as Chairman Choi Tae Guk's son.

632
00:39:57,501 --> 00:39:59,601
I hope it helps you find the answer you're looking for.

633
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:10,420
Darn it. I wanted to wear the prosecutor's robe too.

634
00:40:13,181 --> 00:40:16,021
My gosh. Kang Ja, you look so charismatic.

635
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,891
You too. Everyone would think you're a real lawyer.

636
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,630
What's going on here? What's wrong?

637
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,130
Don't tell me...

638
00:40:27,431 --> 00:40:28,669
you're upset over the mock trial.

639
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,370
Yes, I am.

640
00:40:30,371 --> 00:40:33,200
Hey, I'm really upset because I lost.

641
00:40:33,201 --> 00:40:34,439
At least you won.

642
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,741
I know I won the trial, but I don't agree with the decision.

643
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,379
How could he be not guilty?

644
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,009
The victim was wrongfully imprisoned for three years.

645
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:43,780
How could the prosecutor who put him behind bars be deemed not guilty?

646
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,649
Fine. If everyone in such a case gets a guilty verdict,

647
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:49,721
it will discourage the law enforcement agencies.

648
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,220
"Then when they're not 100 percent sure,"

649
00:40:52,221 --> 00:40:54,430
"they'll be hesitant to apprehend or charge suspects."

650
00:40:54,431 --> 00:40:56,490
"And in the long term, it will lead to social unrest..."

651
00:40:56,491 --> 00:40:58,501
"and cause more chaos"!

652
00:40:59,831 --> 00:41:01,101
That is all true,

653
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,300
but the prosecutor should at least be fined, don't you think?

654
00:41:05,771 --> 00:41:07,510
Yes, exactly!

655
00:41:09,471 --> 00:41:12,980
My, what a beautiful sight.

656
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,350
Who knew the prosecutor and the defence counsel...

657
00:41:14,351 --> 00:41:16,510
could be in complete agreement like this?

658
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,661
We're meeting on the second floor of Professor Oh's building in an hour.

659
00:41:26,891 --> 00:41:28,690
- Professor Oh's building? - All of a sudden?

660
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:29,831
What's going on?

661
00:41:30,061 --> 00:41:33,200
Excuse me. My gosh.

662
00:41:33,201 --> 00:41:35,270
Maybe we should've brought a gift or something.

663
00:41:35,271 --> 00:41:37,040
I know. We came empty-handed.

664
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:39,201
Well, Professor Oh is rich.

665
00:41:39,271 --> 00:41:40,840
My gosh, her place is so nice.

666
00:41:43,681 --> 00:41:45,041
This is Chan's handwriting.

667
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,210
You wrote this, right?

668
00:41:47,811 --> 00:41:50,621
- Yes. - This is Professor Oh's writing.

669
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,920
It looks like Professor Oh added things to Chan's notes.

670
00:41:54,391 --> 00:41:55,820
What is this, Chan?

671
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,860
- I have a favour to ask of you. - What is it?

672
00:41:59,891 --> 00:42:02,391
I'm officially reaching out to the Legal Clinic Center for help.

673
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,260
I want to catch the real culprit in Na Jung's case.

674

Let's catch the culprit. Let's do this, guys.

675

- Okay. - I'm in too!

676

Everyone is here.

677

- Hello. - Oh, you're here.

(What kind of deal was Han Gi Taek offered?)

679
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:34,190
It is important to uncover the truth and catch the culprit,

680
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:37,360
but you should be very careful at all times.

681

When will the sell-off be finalized?

684
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:52,110
We will draw up the final agreement by the end of this week.

685

How's Soo Jae doing?

686
00:42:54,851 --> 00:42:56,920
Nothing out of the ordinary.

687
00:42:57,181 --> 00:42:58,880
Is something going on between you and her?

688
00:43:00,891 --> 00:43:02,149
What about Seung Yeon?

689
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,661
She's at my in-laws' house in Ulsan with Jae Yi for a few days.

690
00:43:06,561 --> 00:43:07,760
Your in-laws?

691
00:43:08,891 --> 00:43:10,090
They aren't my in-laws anymore.

692
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:12,299
She wanted to visit them one last time...

693
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,501
before going to the US.

694
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,300
I should let her do that.

695
00:43:21,271 --> 00:43:23,141
Keep checking up on her.

696
00:43:23,371 --> 00:43:24,411
Okay.

Well, Father.

698
00:43:29,081 --> 00:43:30,721
Do you know...

699
00:43:31,251 --> 00:43:32,880
who bought Chairman Han's house in Samjung-dong?

700
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:36,020
According to Dong O, an American corporation bought it.

701
00:43:36,021 --> 00:43:37,621
Why are you worried about that?

702
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,630
Father, that house doesn't worry you?

703
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:45,960
Why would it?

704
00:43:47,701 --> 00:43:48,730
Why are you worried?

705
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,340
Sir.

706
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,081
You need to watch this.

707
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,509
It's been confirmed that the skeleton found...

708
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:03,149
at the construction site in Yeongpyeong District...

709
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:06,319
belonged to the victim, Jeon, of the step sibling murder case...

710
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,291
in Ungju ten years ago.

711
00:44:08,491 --> 00:44:11,790
Back then, her stepbrother, Kim, was arrested as the culprit.

712
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:15,190
Not being able to find the body broke everyone's heart.

713
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,229
However, when Kim was imprisoned,

714
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:20,060
No who was arrested and questioned for another crime,

715
00:44:20,061 --> 00:44:21,529
turned out to be the culprit.

716
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:23,900
And this discovery shocked the country again.

717
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,440
Father.

718
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,681
I thought you took care of this, Mr. Ha.

719
00:44:37,451 --> 00:44:38,581
I'm sorry.

720
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:39,951
So you knew.

721
00:44:41,291 --> 00:44:43,320
You knew it the moment you saw the skeleton, right?

722
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,920
Because you dumped her there.

723
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,230
That's why...

724
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,070
my father yelled at you.

725
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:58,340
because you failed to take care of that.

726
00:44:59,101 --> 00:45:01,140
You failed to do one job!

727

You punk!

728
00:45:32,471 --> 00:45:33,939
The skeleton that was found...

729
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,669
at the scene of collapse in Yeongpyeong District...

730
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:37,641
was found along with a sack.

731
00:45:38,141 --> 00:45:39,209
Right after the skeleton was found,

732
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:41,709
the police believed it to be connected to a violent crime.

733
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:44,351
And they were trying to identify the skeleton.

734
00:45:44,851 --> 00:45:47,149
And No who was serving time as the real culprit...

735
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:49,620
committed suicide right before his release on parole.

736
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:52,491
Some people speculated that there was a reason behind it.

737
00:45:52,661 --> 00:45:54,759
Then are you implying that...

738
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,130
No's death has something to do with the skeleton?

739
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:58,601
That's right.

740
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:01,200
If you look at the time of No's death,

741
00:46:01,201 --> 00:46:03,030
it was right after the skeleton was found.

742
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:05,270
When he heard that the skeleton was found,

743
00:46:05,271 --> 00:46:06,899
it must have affected his mental state.

744
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,209
And that could have pushed him...

745

to end his life based on the timeline.

What? Shouldn't you keep this under wraps? Not expose him?

these nonsense articles from your young reporters.

823
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,910
What do you mean there was preferential treatment...

824
00:51:40,911 --> 00:51:42,170
Hello?

825
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:44,710
That darn director.

826
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:56,120
This contains some files...

827
00:51:56,121 --> 00:51:57,561
on their preferential treatment in Yeongpyeong District.

828
00:51:58,221 --> 00:51:59,661
Why are you giving me this?

829
00:52:00,621 --> 00:52:02,460
I don't think we're exactly on friendly terms.

830
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:05,931
If you were that harsh toward me,

831
00:52:06,001 --> 00:52:08,800
you would take it all the way whatever it may be.

832
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:13,741
Their preferential treatment in Yeongpyeong District.

833
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:16,610
You were the one who exposed them which I expected.

834
00:52:17,041 --> 00:52:19,480
Because I have all the confidential files.

835
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:23,210
I'm sure they will know what you're up to.

836
00:52:24,221 --> 00:52:25,650
I'm going to make my move first.

837
00:52:26,581 --> 00:52:29,090
I'll tell people the real culprit of the incident ten years ago...

838
00:52:30,221 --> 00:52:34,021
and there was another victim other than Jeon Na Jung.

839
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:39,960
We don't have any concrete evidence. If you act prematurely,

840
00:52:40,771 --> 00:52:42,271
you might get hurt.

841
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:45,201
How much longer will you stay as a coward?

842
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:49,041
Chairman Choi Tae Guk...

843
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:52,280
already figured out Gong Chan is Kim Dong Gu.

844
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,581
It jeopardizes Gong Chan's safety.

845
00:52:59,721 --> 00:53:01,150
I can't put him...

846
00:53:02,251 --> 00:53:03,820
in danger again.

847
00:53:11,831 --> 00:53:13,130
How did it go?

848
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,799
The funeral is over.

849
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,001
And I dropped off Ms. Ji at her house.

850
00:53:18,871 --> 00:53:21,741
And Chan was standing at the memorial park...

851
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:26,880
where people couldn't see him.

852
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:36,391
(The late Jeon Na Jung)

853
00:53:39,991 --> 00:53:41,230
Na Jung.

854
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,161
What took you so long?

855
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:49,270
(Green Junk Shop)

856
00:53:49,271 --> 00:53:51,799
Darn it. Just wait until I catch you.

857
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,741
I'll tell your mom about your part-time job.

858
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:57,541
I said I would catch you.

859
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:01,480
Is that why it took this long?

860
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:04,320
Is that why?

861
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:14,260
I'm sorry.

862
00:54:16,661 --> 00:54:18,561
I should have gotten there sooner.

863
00:54:23,471 --> 00:54:24,570
I'm sorry.

864
00:54:25,541 --> 00:54:32,780
(The late Jeon Na Jung)

865
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,451
Is that you, Dong Gu?

866
00:54:47,121 --> 00:54:50,931
I wondered who would leave food at my house from time to time.

867
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,570
I wondered if it was your dad.

868
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:57,400
He was a loving person despite everything.

869
00:54:57,971 --> 00:54:59,271
That's what I thought.

870
00:55:00,641 --> 00:55:03,311
But at one point, I found milk.

871
00:55:04,581 --> 00:55:05,811
Because...

872
00:55:06,811 --> 00:55:08,581
you always gave me milk.

873
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:13,221
Ms. Song told me that you had been there...

874
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:18,360
throughout Na Jung's send-off ceremony.

875
00:55:23,161 --> 00:55:24,460
Thank you.

876
00:55:27,871 --> 00:55:28,971
Ms. Ji.

877
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:32,271
I'm going to find the real culprit no matter what.

878
00:55:32,601 --> 00:55:35,311
So take care of your health.

879
00:55:35,371 --> 00:55:36,610
Dong Gu.

880
00:55:37,741 --> 00:55:39,710
I know that you didn't do it.

881
00:55:41,851 --> 00:55:43,880
At first, I really thought you did it.

882
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:47,920
I had to curse you out, so I could go on with my life.

883
00:55:49,121 --> 00:55:51,360
When I found out that you didn't do it,

884
00:55:52,061 --> 00:55:53,121
I...

885
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:00,431
I hated myself for it, so I hated you.

886
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:15,980
Dong Gu. I'm sorry.

887
00:56:19,221 --> 00:56:20,721
I'm sorry.

888
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:32,331
Just wait a bit.

889
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,670
I...

890
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:39,340
Na Jung is back now.

891
00:56:40,141 --> 00:56:42,541
You should stop coming here too.

892
00:57:38,601 --> 00:57:42,101
(Chairman Han Sung Bum, Assemblyman Lee In Soo)

893
00:57:47,101 --> 00:57:48,210
Come in.

894
00:57:58,621 --> 00:58:00,021
I need to talk to you.

895
00:58:03,121 --> 00:58:04,351
Go ahead.

896
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:09,190
You must have had your reason for not returning any of my calls.

897
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:18,641
Ten years ago,

898
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:21,510
on September 4, 2012.

899
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,141
That was the day Jeon Na Jung...

900
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,480
whose skeleton was found in Yeongpyeong District was murdered.

901
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,480
That day,

902
00:58:33,951 --> 00:58:36,220
a woman in her 20s was transported to the hospital...

903
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,491
in the middle of the night after a car accident.

904
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,291
Before the accident,

905
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:45,161
she was taken someplace else by three men from a club in Seoul.

906
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,831
I'm sure they drugged her drink...

907
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:50,330
because there was footage of her,

908
00:58:50,331 --> 00:58:52,141
unable to move when she was moved somewhere else.

909
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:10,021
What are you getting at?

910
00:59:10,121 --> 00:59:13,760
The men took the woman to a house in Seoul and raped her.

911
00:59:15,061 --> 00:59:18,460
And the woman escaped frantically and ran away from the house.

912
00:59:19,101 --> 00:59:22,300
Then she ran into a part-timer, Jeon Na Jung, at a convenience store

913
00:59:22,771 --> 00:59:25,041
When Jeon Na Jung tried to help the woman,

914
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:26,840
the men caught up.

915
00:59:27,201 --> 00:59:28,971
The woman started to run again.

916
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:32,041
Then she got hit by a car and was transported to the hospital.

917
00:59:33,681 --> 00:59:36,380
The men were worried that their crime would be exposed.

918
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:39,920
So they took Jeon Na Jung who witnessed everything...

919
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:42,391
and killed her.

920
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:50,460
Chairman Choi doesn't know about Eun Seo.

921
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,760
They didn't tell him about her.

922
00:59:55,701 --> 00:59:58,271
The 3 suspects raped a woman in her 20s...

923
00:59:58,371 --> 01:00:01,371
and murdered Jeon Na Jung.

924
01:00:02,371 --> 01:00:03,840
Han Dong O,

925
01:00:04,371 --> 01:00:05,581
Lee Si Hyuk,

926
01:00:06,181 --> 01:00:08,280
and Choi Ju Wan.

927
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:13,380
What do you think, sir?

928
01:00:16,021 --> 01:00:17,621
That's nonsense.

929
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:22,230
The stepbrother of Jeon Na Jung is Kim Dong Gu.

930
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:28,230
I'm sure you already figured out Gong Chan is Kim Dong Gu.

931
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:33,840
What's your point?

932
01:00:34,501 --> 01:00:36,110
Why are you beating around the bush?

933
01:00:36,311 --> 01:00:38,540
The moment I made the wrong decision...

934
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:41,510
to save my mother and brothers.

935
01:00:44,181 --> 01:00:46,250
I was afraid of regretting that moment,

936
01:00:46,251 --> 01:00:47,480
so I had been neglecting it.

937
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:51,491
But now, I would like to regret it.

938
01:00:54,491 --> 01:00:56,230
My foolish decision...

939
01:00:56,431 --> 01:00:58,960
caused an innocent man, Kim Dong Gu, to be found guilty.

940
01:01:00,601 --> 01:01:03,630
But the three suspects have been living such good lives.

941
01:01:04,701 --> 01:01:06,871
One of them is the son of a presidential candidate.

942
01:01:07,001 --> 01:01:09,241
And the other one is the successor to Hansu Group.

943
01:01:09,871 --> 01:01:11,110
And the last one...

944
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:14,951
is the successor to TK Law Firm.

945
01:01:34,201 --> 01:01:37,170
Soo Jae, I don't know where you heard this nonsense.

946
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,800
Let's say that what you're telling me is true.

947
01:01:41,811 --> 01:01:43,911
But you won't be able to catch them.

948
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:47,880
Especially Ju Wan.

949
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:51,681
You will never be able to catch him.

950
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:01,991
Jae Yi.

951
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,331
She's your daughter.

952
01:02:23,751 --> 01:02:26,820
(Why Her?)

953
01:02:46,871 --> 01:02:48,170
Let's talk about Jae Yi later.

954
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:50,510
Shut it.

955
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:52,440
Did you come because you wanted to see me?

956
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:54,880
Why couldn't I recognize you?

957
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:56,779
How could anyone do something like that?

958
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:59,320
Father did everything! It was him!

959
01:02:59,451 --> 01:03:01,220
Don't pretend you're any different.

960
01:03:01,221 --> 01:03:04,220
Father has you and me in the palm of his hand.

961
01:03:04,221 --> 01:03:06,819
Stop trying to be smart. Tell me the truth.

962
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:08,560
I don't know!

963
01:03:08,561 --> 01:03:10,530
If I go down, the party will go down too!

964
01:03:10,831 --> 01:03:11,831
Darn it.

965
01:03:11,832 --> 01:03:14,700
You crazy punk! Who else was there?

966
01:03:14,701 --> 01:03:16,900
Can Ms. Oh bring down Chairman Choi?

967
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:19,500
You're using your daughter to cut a deal with me.

968
01:03:19,501 --> 01:03:21,770
I'm going to raise her well as my daughter.

969
01:03:21,771 --> 01:03:25,009
I'll give you the 70 million dollars you want. Isn't that enough?

970
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:26,680
Yes. Give it to me.

971
01:03:26,681 --> 01:03:28,580
Give me the 70 million dollars and sign the document.

972
01:03:28,581 --> 01:03:29,581
Give me everything I want.

973
01:03:29,582 --> 01:03:31,779
Do you think I didn't find evidence?

974
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:32,819
You...

975
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:34,850
I'll give you two hours to sign the document.

976
01:03:34,851 --> 01:03:36,950
I'm not offering a deal. It's an order.

977
01:03:36,951 --> 01:03:39,720
Since I made my move, Chairman Choi will make his too.

978
01:03:39,721 --> 01:03:41,090
Tell everyone to be careful.

979
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,630
Jae Yi is gone.

980
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:45,101
Give me the address now. Where are you?

981
01:03:45,201 --> 01:03:46,331
What do I do?
