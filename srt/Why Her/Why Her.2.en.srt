(and organizations portrayed in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:24,461 --> 00:00:25,461
Okay.

4
00:01:16,852 --> 00:01:18,322
She didn't recognize me.

5
00:01:20,482 --> 00:01:21,822
I'm glad.

(Episode 2)

7
00:01:28,262 --> 00:01:30,331
Remember your first day at the Research and Training Institute?

8
00:01:32,602 --> 00:01:34,331
I could tell right away.

(Never let my client end up in prison.)

10
00:01:42,872 --> 00:01:44,881
Never let your client end up in prison.

(Slammer)

12
00:01:57,391 --> 00:02:00,221
I thought, "Oh Soo Jae will be the troublemaker in this batch."

13
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:04,232
I was naive back then.

14
00:02:04,432 --> 00:02:06,202
I didn't know I'd become this jaded.

15
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:09,171
(Launch of Legal Clinic Center)

16
00:02:09,172 --> 00:02:11,842
I believe the director position is vacant.

17
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:13,501
I'll do it.

18
00:02:13,502 --> 00:02:16,341
Well, the position itself isn't that great.

19
00:02:16,442 --> 00:02:19,211
You'll have many nuisances to deal with.

20
00:02:19,311 --> 00:02:21,252
People say I drove Park So Young to suicide.

21
00:02:22,412 --> 00:02:25,252
I was unfairly pushed out of my job due to such public opinion.

22
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:28,021
I must win the public over so I can return quickly.

23
00:02:28,452 --> 00:02:30,091
I need to build favourable public opinion.

24
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:33,322
Favourable public opinion?

25
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:38,032
Then the Legal Clinic Center could help you.

26
00:02:39,431 --> 00:02:42,831
But that position has been spoken for. I'm sorry.

27
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:39,261
The person you're trying to reach...

28
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:41,361
Where did she go?

29
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:53,202
Excuse me.

30
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:56,111
Do you really not know where Na Jung is?

31
00:03:57,811 --> 00:03:59,640
I told you. She wasn't here when I got here.

32
00:03:59,641 --> 00:04:02,252
What if my boss finds out? Darn you...

33
00:04:02,882 --> 00:04:06,081
What? Did you just swear at me?

34
00:04:07,722 --> 00:04:09,952
If Na Jung shows up, tell her to call me right away.

35
00:04:10,491 --> 00:04:11,561
Okay?

36
00:04:12,091 --> 00:04:13,922
Who are you?

37
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:16,431
- I'm her brother. - Her real brother?

38
00:04:18,232 --> 00:04:19,460
Are you her real brother?

39
00:04:19,461 --> 00:04:22,602
Yes, what else? Do you think I'm her fake brother?

40
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:24,272
Get your act together.

41
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:29,611

42
00:04:33,582 --> 00:04:34,681

Na Jung!

44

The person you're trying to reach...

45
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:50,630
Darn it. Just wait until I catch you.

46
00:04:50,631 --> 00:04:52,761
I'll tell your mom about your part-time job.

Na Jung. Hey, wake up.

00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,152
Na Jung! Wake up!

55
00:05:46,022 --> 00:05:48,691
Hello? Can someone help us?

56
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:51,121
Hey, wake up.

57
00:05:52,462 --> 00:05:54,222
Hello? Help...

58
00:06:16,152 --> 00:06:18,521
- Thank you. Bye. - Bye!

59
00:06:18,522 --> 00:06:20,652
- Best of luck. Take care! - Everything was delicious!

60
00:06:21,082 --> 00:06:22,450
- Come often. - Okay!

61
00:06:22,451 --> 00:06:24,690
- I'll give you lots of freebies. - My gosh! Thank you.

62
00:06:24,691 --> 00:06:25,791
Bye.

(Sorry, we're closed. Please come again.)

64
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:29,631
Will Chan be home late again?

65
00:06:30,662 --> 00:06:32,031
I guess he has a lot to study.

66
00:06:32,032 --> 00:06:36,201
Hey, today is that day. You know...

67
00:06:36,602 --> 00:06:38,402
Hey, Chan is here.

68
00:06:38,902 --> 00:06:41,311
Just pretend not to know anything, okay?

69
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:43,412
Hey, whenever I see him like that,

70
00:06:43,741 --> 00:06:45,342
I feel so bad for him that I get angry.

71
00:06:46,381 --> 00:06:48,352
Hey, law student!

72
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:55,950
They'll sell Hansu Bio...

73
00:06:55,951 --> 00:06:58,821
to fund Assemblyman Lee In Soo's presidential campaign.

74
00:06:59,092 --> 00:07:03,131
Director Han Ki Taek will launder the money.

75
00:07:04,832 --> 00:07:07,261
And these boxes must contain all the evidence.

76
00:07:07,732 --> 00:07:10,402
But it won't be easy to find evidence.

77
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:12,570
Our job was to hide such evidence,

78
00:07:12,571 --> 00:07:15,071
and we did a pretty meticulous job of concealing everything.

79
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:18,411
Besides, I heard Chairman Han's personal assets...

80
00:07:18,412 --> 00:07:21,550
were managed by Chairman Choi Tae Guk.

81
00:07:21,551 --> 00:07:24,782
Chairman Choi manages Chairman Han's slush fund?

82
00:07:24,881 --> 00:07:27,251
Create a list of everything the two of you hid.

83
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:30,251
One more thing.

84
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:33,162
I need you to find something you don't even know about.

85
00:07:34,222 --> 00:07:37,131
That information includes something beyond your imagination.

86
00:07:38,261 --> 00:07:39,462
Make sure to find it.

87
00:07:40,032 --> 00:07:41,631
Something beyond your imagination.

88
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:45,402
Find it, no matter what.

89
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,611
(Congratulations, Managing Partner Choi Ju Wan.)

90
00:08:03,491 --> 00:08:06,022
I apologize. You cannot enter, Ms. Oh.

91
00:08:06,722 --> 00:08:07,990
What do you mean?

92
00:08:07,991 --> 00:08:09,760
It says you're on vacation at the moment.

93
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:11,190
As you know, you cannot enter the building...

94
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,832
when you're taking time away from work.

95
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:16,272
I'm on vacation, and I don't even know about it?

96
00:08:17,272 --> 00:08:18,272
I apologize.

97
00:08:19,472 --> 00:08:21,102
You should rest up and enjoy your vacation.

98
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:24,172
What brings you by, Soo Jae?

99
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:29,781
I saw that you moved the documents on Hansu Bio.

100
00:08:29,782 --> 00:08:31,051
Are you here to do a handover?

101
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:36,622
I can't enter the office because of my vacation I never even requested,

102
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:40,422
and the man who stole my position from me is talking about a handover.

103
00:08:41,292 --> 00:08:42,632
This keeps getting more interesting.

104
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:45,100
You may let her in.

105
00:08:45,101 --> 00:08:47,101
- Yes, sir. - See you around.

106
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:54,071
- Congratulations, Mr. Choi! - Thank you.

107
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:56,471
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

108
00:08:56,571 --> 00:08:58,111
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

109
00:08:58,112 --> 00:09:01,311
- Congratulations, Mr. Choi. - Congratulations.

110
00:09:01,811 --> 00:09:05,152
Thank you. I'll do my best for the continued success of TK Law Firm.

111
00:09:05,351 --> 00:09:07,152
Let's welcome Mr. Choi with a big round of applause!

112
00:09:29,142 --> 00:09:31,512
I want to pee!

113
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:34,681
I need to pee!

114
00:09:35,811 --> 00:09:37,481
I'm so sorry, Ms. Oh.

115
00:09:37,551 --> 00:09:39,421
Who brings their kid to work?

116
00:09:39,422 --> 00:09:41,022
I need to pee!

117
00:09:50,061 --> 00:09:51,091
But Soo Jae.

118
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:53,431
Do you think I would let all my hard work benefit someone else?

119
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:55,800
If that's the case, I would just quit.

120
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:57,700
I saw that you moved the documents on Hansu Bio.

121
00:09:57,701 --> 00:09:58,801
Are you here to do a handover?

122
00:10:14,422 --> 00:10:17,551
- Grandpa! - My sweet pumpkin!

123
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:19,991
My gosh, where were you?

124
00:10:19,992 --> 00:10:22,961
- I was in the restroom. - Oh, I see.

125
00:10:24,262 --> 00:10:26,600
Look who's here. Say hello.

126
00:10:26,601 --> 00:10:29,532
Her name is Oh Soo Jae. Lawyer Oh Soo Jae.

127
00:10:29,731 --> 00:10:31,641
Hello, ma'am.

128
00:10:31,642 --> 00:10:33,600
My name is Choi Jae Yi.

129
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:37,112
I'm entering elementary school. I even ordered my school uniform.

130
00:10:37,612 --> 00:10:39,681
Jae Yi, where have you been?

131
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:43,782
Hand all the documents over to Ju Wan.

132
00:10:44,282 --> 00:10:45,581
Ju Wan will do a good job too.

133
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:48,652
Let's go.

134
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:52,262
So you ordered your school uniform, Jae Yi?

135
00:10:52,691 --> 00:10:54,321
You're a big girl now.

136
00:10:58,731 --> 00:10:59,801
Yes.

137
00:11:00,132 --> 00:11:02,701
Professor, this is your TA. What should I do?

138
00:11:03,272 --> 00:11:04,701
It looks like your class will get cancelled.

139
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:07,601
Everyone's refusing to take your class.

140
00:11:15,912 --> 00:11:17,152
Why didn't you switch out?

141
00:11:19,551 --> 00:11:21,622
I like Professor Oh.

142
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:24,351
Is this class going to get cancelled?

143
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,262
Classes with less than five students get cancelled.

144
00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:28,662
It's Oh Soo Jae.

145
00:11:29,831 --> 00:11:32,032
You see, I know the legal world quite well.

146
00:11:32,362 --> 00:11:35,831
She will never let that happen.

147
00:11:38,502 --> 00:11:40,402
Here's an announcement from Professor Oh Soo Jae.

148
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,372
Nice, amazing!

149
00:11:42,512 --> 00:11:46,112
Among the students who are taking Basics of Fieldwork for Lawyers,

150
00:11:46,211 --> 00:11:48,550
the one who gets the highest mark this semester will get to intern...

151
00:11:48,551 --> 00:11:50,911
at TK and receive 20,000 dollars to put toward tuition fees,

152
00:11:50,912 --> 00:11:53,152
out of Professor Oh's out pocket.

153
00:11:54,351 --> 00:11:58,022
When you're collecting and submitting facts and evidence,

154
00:11:58,191 --> 00:11:59,321
you need to...

155
00:12:00,022 --> 00:12:01,392
What's going on?

156
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:03,561
Guys. My goodness.

157
00:12:22,051 --> 00:12:23,112
My gosh.

158
00:12:35,632 --> 00:12:38,191
I've compiled verdicts of the major cases from the past five years.

159
00:12:38,262 --> 00:12:41,032
You will submit your own analysis before the end of the semester.

160
00:12:41,402 --> 00:12:43,031
My lecture will take place once in a while.

161
00:12:43,032 --> 00:12:44,471
You'll be graded on...

162
00:12:44,971 --> 00:12:47,402
Your analysis is worth 50 percent, and so is the exam.

163
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:49,941
Your lecture will take place once in a while?

164
00:12:50,941 --> 00:12:53,841
Then could you tell us how you'd like us to analyse the verdicts?

165
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,652
Suit yourselves.

166
00:12:57,012 --> 00:12:58,981
- What? What was that? - My gosh.

167
00:12:59,882 --> 00:13:01,792
- What's her deal? - What was that about?

168
00:13:03,752 --> 00:13:06,591
All right. Before I give these out,

169
00:13:06,721 --> 00:13:08,862
I'll tell you who your supervisors are.

170
00:13:09,362 --> 00:13:11,361
Group one, Professor Jung Hee Young.

171
00:13:11,362 --> 00:13:14,161
Group 2, Professor Seo Jun Myung. Group 3, Professor Hong Ki Pyo.

172
00:13:14,162 --> 00:13:15,930
Group four, Professor Jang Jae Soon.

173
00:13:15,931 --> 00:13:17,700
Group five, Professor Park Sang Jin.

174
00:13:17,701 --> 00:13:19,171
Group six, Professor Yang Ji Won.

175
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:20,800
Group seven, Professor Lee Jang Hyuk.

176
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:21,941
Group eight.

177
00:13:22,971 --> 00:13:24,172
Professor Oh Soo Jae.

178
00:13:25,282 --> 00:13:27,181
You'll sit with your supervisor at the upcoming event,

179
00:13:27,512 --> 00:13:29,211
Seojung University Law School Night.

180
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:33,152
This is nuts. How come nothing's going my way?

181
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:35,292
I was told this was my lucky year.

182
00:13:37,022 --> 00:13:39,221
I'm already liking this year much better than last year.

183
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:41,591
Aren't you in your first year?

184
00:13:41,762 --> 00:13:44,330
No? You're not?

185
00:13:44,331 --> 00:13:46,261
Me? This is my second year.

186
00:13:46,262 --> 00:13:47,532
I got straight F's, so I'm retaking everything.

187
00:13:49,831 --> 00:13:51,372
We're all in the same group, right?

188
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:55,172
Oh, right?

189
00:13:56,372 --> 00:13:59,612
Don't hang out with me. Your grades will drop to my level.

190
00:14:06,981 --> 00:14:09,220
Mr. Lee, what's next on your official schedule?

191
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:11,591
Why did you choose the National Cemetery as your first stop?

192
00:14:12,961 --> 00:14:16,032
I will live up to the people's expectations of me.

193
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:19,561
Assemblyman Lee In Soo!

194
00:14:20,731 --> 00:14:22,172
It's okay. Let him.

195
00:14:43,892 --> 00:14:45,091
- Hello, sir. - Hi.

196
00:14:46,392 --> 00:14:48,091
My gosh, everyone is working so hard.

197
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:53,402
You didn't have to wait outside.

198
00:14:53,831 --> 00:14:55,172
Let's go inside.

199
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:57,301
- Sir. - What is it?

200
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:01,701
(Hansu Bio Financial Statements)

201
00:15:07,412 --> 00:15:08,481
Darn it!

202
00:15:28,331 --> 00:15:29,431
Sir.

203
00:15:30,002 --> 00:15:31,301
Open this, Ms. Song.

204
00:15:32,272 --> 00:15:34,301
- Pardon me? - What are you waiting for? Open it.

205
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:37,070
Without Ms. Oh's permission, I can't...

206
00:15:37,071 --> 00:15:39,012
Do you not know that Ms. Oh also works for me?

207
00:15:39,282 --> 00:15:41,811
Don't just stand around. Open it at once!

208
00:15:59,002 --> 00:16:00,132
My gosh.

209
00:16:05,101 --> 00:16:07,441
She took all the documents and put in a comic book?

210
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:10,940
I'm getting goosebumps all over. She sure has a lot of nerve.

211
00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:12,012
I give her that.

212
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:16,752
Soo Jae, that cheeky brat.

213
00:16:18,382 --> 00:16:20,221
Ms. Oh!

214
00:16:20,882 --> 00:16:23,551
My gosh. You should've at least given me a heads-up.

215
00:16:24,152 --> 00:16:26,262
I almost peed my pants!

216
00:16:26,422 --> 00:16:28,162
You like comic books.

217
00:16:28,561 --> 00:16:29,661
I got it for you.

218
00:16:29,662 --> 00:16:31,791
Chairman Choi was fuming mad.

219
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:33,502
I thought he was going to kill me.

220
00:16:34,331 --> 00:16:36,402
(2022 Seojung University Law School Night)

221
00:16:36,601 --> 00:16:38,541
(Law Professional of the Year, Choi Tae Guk of TK Law Firm)

222
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:40,502
Is this world a just place?

223
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:44,711
Unfortunately, the world we live in is not a just place.

224
00:16:45,642 --> 00:16:48,951
Then is it a fair place? No, never.

225
00:16:49,181 --> 00:16:52,481
Such injustice and unfairness will continue to prevail.

226
00:16:52,652 --> 00:16:56,091
Things may even get worse.

227
00:16:56,652 --> 00:17:00,761
However, we have the law, our last bastion of hope.

228
00:17:00,762 --> 00:17:05,731
In this world, which is never fair or just,

229
00:17:06,132 --> 00:17:09,000
the law must be applied equally to everyone,

230
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:12,541
and you must dutifully carry out your responsibilities.

231
00:17:12,842 --> 00:17:15,540
Law professionals who defend justice by making sure the law...

232
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,311
won't falter before money and power.

233
00:17:17,312 --> 00:17:18,582
That is the path that I...

234
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,912
and my fellow Seojung law professionals have chosen.

235
00:17:21,511 --> 00:17:25,551
I truly hope that all of you here will do the same.

236
00:17:25,552 --> 00:17:27,281
I will help you in every way I can.

237
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:28,892
Use me all you want.

238
00:17:28,991 --> 00:17:32,721
I will gladly be used for the sake of your bright futures.

239
00:17:33,422 --> 00:17:36,562
Thank you very much for choosing Seojung University Law School.

240
00:17:51,142 --> 00:17:52,980
Two special guests...

241
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:55,781
took time out of their busy schedules to join us today.

242
00:17:56,751 --> 00:17:59,020
Chairman Han Sung Bum, who always gives us...

243
00:17:59,021 --> 00:18:00,882
all the support we need.

244
00:18:01,251 --> 00:18:04,891
And Assemblyman Lee In Soo, the Seojung graduate we're so proud of.

245
00:18:04,892 --> 00:18:06,362
Please welcome them with a big round of applause.

246
00:18:32,822 --> 00:18:36,352
Congratulations, sir. I should've brought you some flowers.

247
00:18:37,352 --> 00:18:38,422
Why did you do that?

248
00:18:41,392 --> 00:18:43,592
Why did you have to provoke the two of them like that?

249
00:18:53,441 --> 00:18:56,041
Let's be honest. Chairman Choi has ditched you.

250
00:18:56,271 --> 00:18:57,372
Am I wrong?

251
00:18:57,612 --> 00:19:00,842
Just return all the documents and take good care of the sell-off.

252
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:04,781
Then I'll help you so that you can open a nice law firm of your own.

253
00:19:05,281 --> 00:19:07,721
You know that I helped Chairman Choi get to where he is today.

254
00:19:10,552 --> 00:19:13,220
Hand over the documents to me,

255
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:15,691
and I'll create a nice position for you.

256
00:19:17,191 --> 00:19:20,431
I always thought that you had too much to offer...

257
00:19:20,562 --> 00:19:22,572
to just keep working under Chairman Choi.

258
00:19:23,632 --> 00:19:26,071
Once my campaign office is set up, you can be my spokesperson.

259
00:19:26,072 --> 00:19:27,771
If you'd like, you can join me in the Blue House too.

260
00:19:28,142 --> 00:19:29,412
One step at a time.

261
00:19:37,751 --> 00:19:41,552
What are you thinking? What on earth are you cooking up?

262
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:44,322
What are you thinking, sir?

263
00:19:45,662 --> 00:19:48,392
Do you really not know why I sent people to Hansu Group...

264
00:19:48,691 --> 00:19:51,231
to get all those documents?

265
00:19:51,362 --> 00:19:52,431
Right.

266
00:19:53,832 --> 00:19:55,201
To secure the managing partner position...

267
00:19:56,431 --> 00:19:58,030
and spearhead the sale of Hansu Bio,

268
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,871
you made sure to get your hands on the documents.

269
00:19:59,872 --> 00:20:02,612
But you lost both, so I understand why you're angry.

270
00:20:02,812 --> 00:20:04,142
However, Soo Jae...

271
00:20:06,882 --> 00:20:09,912
I'm having my son take care of it. My own son.

272
00:20:11,481 --> 00:20:13,180
It's a two billion dollar deal.

273
00:20:13,181 --> 00:20:15,321
The commission alone will be 70 million dollars.

274
00:20:15,322 --> 00:20:16,791
It's a huge undertaking.

275
00:20:17,822 --> 00:20:20,721
Do you really think Mr. Choi Ju Wan can handle it?

276
00:20:21,862 --> 00:20:23,632
What is it that you want?

277
00:20:23,862 --> 00:20:25,631
Getting back the managing partner position?

278
00:20:25,632 --> 00:20:28,971
No, that'd be too embarrassing.

279
00:20:29,172 --> 00:20:31,000
Everyone in the industry knows that I was ousted...

280
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:32,741
and have been exiled to the law school.

281
00:20:32,971 --> 00:20:34,541
I'll find my way back.

282
00:20:35,842 --> 00:20:38,812
However, the sale of Hansu Bio.

283
00:20:40,842 --> 00:20:42,612
Let me be the one in charge.

284
00:20:43,582 --> 00:20:45,582
I won't get in Mr. Choi's way.

285
00:20:46,021 --> 00:20:49,122
Managing Partner Choi Ju Wan, the son of Chairman Choi Tae Guk.

286
00:20:49,251 --> 00:20:50,991
Everyone knows who he is.

287
00:20:52,261 --> 00:20:54,290
Taking me by surprise with the comic book,

288
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,392
and once again with those documents.

289
00:20:58,902 --> 00:21:01,162
Making my son stay to be the face of the firm.

290
00:21:03,072 --> 00:21:04,632
You really have grown a lot.

291
00:21:05,402 --> 00:21:07,342
I learned from the best.

292
00:21:09,271 --> 00:21:11,912
I'm always grateful for everything you've done for me, sir.

293
00:21:12,882 --> 00:21:14,082
Thanks.

294
00:21:26,191 --> 00:21:27,392
Ms. Oh!

295
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,431
Should I call you Professor Oh now?

296
00:21:30,691 --> 00:21:32,562
You look amazing.

297
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:36,201
What do you do for your skin? You look like you're still in your 20s.

298
00:21:38,302 --> 00:21:40,271
I see that you still haven't quit this habit.

299
00:21:40,372 --> 00:21:41,802
Grow up.

300
00:21:42,241 --> 00:21:44,311
Why should I?

301
00:21:44,312 --> 00:21:46,041
You should always stay young at heart.

302
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:47,741
Come on. Let's go!

303
00:21:48,582 --> 00:21:51,251
- Let's grab a drink together. - Do you want to end up in jail?

304
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,520
Get off of me.

305
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:56,091
Come on! Don't be so sensitive.

306
00:21:56,092 --> 00:21:58,892
People would think I groped you or something.

307
00:22:00,592 --> 00:22:03,592
Don't be like this. You're putting me on the spot.

308
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,031
I'm just so happy to see you.

309
00:22:11,802 --> 00:22:14,500
- Are you all right? - Hey, who are you?

310
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,112
Professor Oh, are you okay?

311
00:22:16,241 --> 00:22:18,511
You little punk. Who are you?

312
00:22:19,142 --> 00:22:21,341
I am Gong Chan in 1L year, Professor Seo Jun Myung.

313
00:22:21,342 --> 00:22:24,382
You're in your first year? How dare you...

314
00:22:24,481 --> 00:22:25,852
Should I call the police?

315
00:22:26,582 --> 00:22:27,652
Or...

316
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:31,122
Shall we watch that together?

317
00:22:35,662 --> 00:22:38,460
You must be out of your mind. Hey!

318
00:22:38,461 --> 00:22:39,731
Just leave.

319
00:22:40,731 --> 00:22:43,102
I do not want this to turn into a commotion, so leave quietly.

320
00:22:45,602 --> 00:22:47,441
I can't believe this.

321
00:22:49,011 --> 00:22:50,341
Apologize to her before you leave.

322
00:22:50,342 --> 00:22:52,072
How dare you stop me?

323
00:22:58,112 --> 00:23:00,251
You'd better stay out of my sight.

324
00:23:00,382 --> 00:23:03,622
If you're in my class, drop it. You got that?

325
00:23:11,191 --> 00:23:13,430
- Why would you let him walk away? - What?

326
00:23:13,431 --> 00:23:16,501
You need to make him apologize so he'd know what he did wrong.

327
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:20,501
Why aren't you asking me to apologize?

328
00:23:21,471 --> 00:23:22,541
Sorry?

329
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:24,271
I...

330
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:27,211
slapped you in the face, twice.

331
00:23:30,281 --> 00:23:31,352
Oh, that.

332
00:23:32,781 --> 00:23:34,122
Because I was fine.

333
00:23:37,622 --> 00:23:39,461
You seemed to be under a lot of stress that day,

334
00:23:40,122 --> 00:23:41,862
so I just thought,

335
00:23:42,862 --> 00:23:46,031
"It's fine if that helped her feel better."

336
00:23:52,372 --> 00:23:53,802
Even so, I should apologize.

337
00:23:55,342 --> 00:23:57,142
I shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry.

338
00:23:59,781 --> 00:24:03,251
And about today, could you pretend you didn't see it?

339
00:24:04,812 --> 00:24:05,852
Sure.

340
00:24:11,592 --> 00:24:12,662
Oh, right.

341
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:14,862
One more thing.

342
00:24:16,531 --> 00:24:19,231
Don't meddle in my business again, whatever it may be.

343
00:24:20,402 --> 00:24:23,572
I don't like it when others stick their nose in my business.

344
00:24:35,882 --> 00:24:37,082
Oh, just a moment.

345
00:24:38,552 --> 00:24:39,681
Choi Yoon Sang!

346
00:24:44,491 --> 00:24:46,491
Must I run into you like this?

347
00:24:47,162 --> 00:24:49,230
You should've come home on your mother's death anniversary.

348
00:24:49,231 --> 00:24:51,791
If only you'd been that good to her when she was alive.

349
00:24:52,961 --> 00:24:54,460
Ju Wan is the firm's managing partner now.

350
00:24:54,461 --> 00:24:56,102
You should join TK soon too.

351
00:24:58,201 --> 00:25:00,072
Do you really think Ju Wan can handle it?

352
00:25:01,142 --> 00:25:02,510
You should've kept Soo Jae in the position...

353
00:25:02,511 --> 00:25:04,072
had you wanted the firm to do well.

354
00:25:04,572 --> 00:25:06,541
How could you give it to her and take it back?

355
00:25:06,941 --> 00:25:10,451
Ju Wan can do it. Don't belittle your brother.

356
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:13,450
To me, Choi Ju Wan is just a piece of trash.

357
00:25:13,451 --> 00:25:14,781
He's your brother. How dare you...

358
00:25:15,852 --> 00:25:16,991
I'm off, Dad.

359
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:36,572
Soo Jae.

360
00:25:37,741 --> 00:25:39,941
- Hey! - What?

361
00:25:40,511 --> 00:25:43,251
I can't believe you have to retake 1L-year classes.

362
00:25:43,612 --> 00:25:44,981
You even retook the CSAT.

363
00:25:45,951 --> 00:25:48,751
There's one thing I'm grateful to my dad for.

364
00:25:49,852 --> 00:25:51,021
Hiring this amazing tutor for me...

365
00:25:52,521 --> 00:25:55,392
when I was studying to retake the CSAT.

366
00:25:57,162 --> 00:26:00,602
I think I can totally focus on my studies this year, thanks to you.

367
00:26:01,162 --> 00:26:03,271
School is so much fun all of a sudden.

368
00:26:03,632 --> 00:26:05,802
Do not call me by my first name at school.

369
00:26:05,902 --> 00:26:07,302
Not even as a mistake.

370
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:10,511
Make a mistake, and I will kill you.

371
00:26:10,842 --> 00:26:12,142
You'll come to the after-party, right?

372
00:26:13,011 --> 00:26:14,211
Are you leaving?

373
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,281
Soo Jae!

374
00:26:21,352 --> 00:26:22,791
Cranky as ever.

375
00:26:24,991 --> 00:26:27,592
(Karaoke)

376
00:27:10,632 --> 00:27:12,801
- This is nuts. - I can't believe this.

377
00:27:12,802 --> 00:27:15,101
- How could he do such a thing? - It's horrible.

378
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:18,072
- Shouldn't he be reprimanded? - Is this for real?

379
00:27:21,011 --> 00:27:23,950
Professor Seo Jun Myung sexually assaulted me.

380
00:27:23,951 --> 00:27:27,081
I am Na Se Ryeon, a proud 1L law student at Seojung University.

381
00:27:27,082 --> 00:27:29,351
At Seojung University Law School Night's after-party,

382
00:27:29,352 --> 00:27:31,791
Professor Seo Jun Myung sexually assaulted me.

383
00:27:31,892 --> 00:27:34,990
He touched and kissed me,

384
00:27:34,991 --> 00:27:36,691
and I felt humiliated.

385
00:27:36,761 --> 00:27:38,461
You touched me!

386
00:27:38,632 --> 00:27:41,530
What are you talking about? I just brushed against you.

387
00:27:41,531 --> 00:27:43,631
It's not like I molested you or something.

388
00:27:43,632 --> 00:27:46,571
You did. You touched my breasts,

389
00:27:46,572 --> 00:27:48,001
my waist,

390
00:27:48,471 --> 00:27:50,841
and even my butt.

391
00:27:50,842 --> 00:27:53,641
Me? Hey, Na Se Ryeon.

392
00:27:53,642 --> 00:27:55,950
You got the wrong idea.

393
00:27:55,951 --> 00:27:58,551
Wrong idea? Don't give me that nonsense.

394
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:02,652
Hey, Nam Chun Poong. You tell us.

395
00:28:02,721 --> 00:28:04,152
You saw it too.

396
00:28:04,322 --> 00:28:06,892
What? Yes.

397
00:28:08,691 --> 00:28:11,662
You idiot. How long has this been up here?

398
00:28:12,431 --> 00:28:14,461
When was this put up here?

399
00:28:15,132 --> 00:28:16,832
What are you doing? Take it down!

400
00:28:16,971 --> 00:28:18,102
Yes, sir.

401
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:24,541
She took all that time to write such gibberish?

402
00:28:25,511 --> 00:28:27,241
What a lunatic.

403
00:28:30,582 --> 00:28:33,152
Don't be nervous. Relax and tell us what happened.

404
00:28:33,882 --> 00:28:35,552
We took down your post.

405
00:28:36,352 --> 00:28:38,020
It could ruin the school's reputation,

406
00:28:38,021 --> 00:28:41,221
and you could actually be sued for defamation.

407
00:28:42,062 --> 00:28:44,991
Professor Seo always gets high ratings from his students.

408
00:28:45,231 --> 00:28:46,661
His lectures are great,

409
00:28:46,662 --> 00:28:48,901
and he always helps his students land good jobs upon graduation.

410
00:28:48,902 --> 00:28:51,831
You know he was a senior prosecutor before joining the school.

411
00:28:51,832 --> 00:28:53,142
So what?

412
00:28:54,001 --> 00:28:56,141
What does that have to do with me?

413
00:28:56,142 --> 00:28:59,481
We spoke with him to check the facts before we called you here.

414
00:28:59,882 --> 00:29:01,681
The karaoke room was dark.

415
00:29:02,511 --> 00:29:04,052
And I admit that I was drunk.

416
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,352
I think I wobbled a little because I was tipsy.

417
00:29:07,352 --> 00:29:10,052
I remember falling toward Na Se Ryeon.

418
00:29:10,392 --> 00:29:13,491
I guess I brushed against her or something. I don't remember.

419
00:29:14,392 --> 00:29:15,592
I'm telling you the facts.

420
00:29:15,691 --> 00:29:18,632
Right, Nam Chun Poong was there too.

421
00:29:19,662 --> 00:29:21,031
You can ask him.

422
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:25,132
Professor Seo said that was what happened. Is it true?

423
00:29:26,142 --> 00:29:27,872
Think carefully before you answer.

424
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:30,671
Think carefully?

425
00:29:30,672 --> 00:29:34,011
Professor Seo could sue you both,

426
00:29:34,812 --> 00:29:36,652
and you could also be expelled from school.

427
00:29:46,521 --> 00:29:49,162
Yes, it's true.

428
00:29:49,461 --> 00:29:52,731
Chun Poong said that?

429
00:29:52,802 --> 00:29:55,201
So just admit that you got the wrong idea...

430
00:29:55,531 --> 00:29:57,102
and apologize to Professor Seo.

431
00:29:58,031 --> 00:29:59,072
My gosh.

432
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:02,501
This is beyond ridiculous.

433
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:04,671
- What? - Na Se Ryeon.

434
00:30:04,672 --> 00:30:07,342
- We're trying to help you. - As if!

435
00:30:09,312 --> 00:30:11,552
Forget it.

436
00:30:12,582 --> 00:30:14,822
Just stay out of it, okay?

437
00:30:17,521 --> 00:30:18,721
Hey, Na Se Ryeon.

438
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:20,362
Na Se Ryeon!

439
00:30:30,971 --> 00:30:32,271
Na Se Ryeon.

440
00:30:33,672 --> 00:30:35,672
Why did you do something like that?

441
00:30:36,771 --> 00:30:38,971
How did you misunderstand so badly?

442
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:43,151
I'm so shocked and angry,

443
00:30:43,152 --> 00:30:45,711
but I decided to forgive you...

444
00:30:46,751 --> 00:30:48,251
since you're a clueless 1L student.

445
00:30:49,152 --> 00:30:51,291
So post a public apology...

446
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:54,822
and don't make a mistake like that again. Do you understand?

447
00:30:55,162 --> 00:30:57,132
You should be the one to apologize, Professor.

448
00:30:58,191 --> 00:31:00,461
You should post a public apology!

449
00:31:03,302 --> 00:31:05,031
You haven't gotten your thoughts in order yet, I see.

450
00:31:05,971 --> 00:31:07,440
It's okay. I can understand.

451
00:31:07,441 --> 00:31:09,612
But it's a fact that you misunderstood.

452
00:31:09,872 --> 00:31:11,312
Don't deny that.

453
00:31:13,981 --> 00:31:16,312
Get going, all of you.

454
00:31:16,882 --> 00:31:19,211
Your staring is going to make Se Ryeon feel worse.

455
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:27,422
You really don't know how this world works.

456
00:31:27,991 --> 00:31:31,092
People really can't escape their lowly origins, I suppose.

457
00:31:33,501 --> 00:31:36,971
Maybe they have lower intelligence or dirty blood.

458
00:31:38,872 --> 00:31:40,271
You dirty punk.

459
00:31:41,142 --> 00:31:42,372
You killed her.

460
00:31:43,241 --> 00:31:45,112
You raped your stepsister,

461
00:31:46,711 --> 00:31:49,912
killed her, and threw her body in the ocean.

462
00:31:51,882 --> 00:31:54,721
Look. I said look, you punk.

463
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:59,892
It's not true. I'm not the culprit.

464
00:32:00,592 --> 00:32:02,592
I really didn't do it.

465
00:32:02,761 --> 00:32:05,431
Look. You dirty punk.

466
00:32:05,961 --> 00:32:08,102
You lowlife.

467
00:32:08,402 --> 00:32:10,371
Dirty blood.

468
00:32:10,372 --> 00:32:13,102
Look! Look, you punk!

469
00:32:14,241 --> 00:32:15,572
Be smart.

470
00:32:22,142 --> 00:32:23,651
What do you think you're doing, punk?

471
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:27,351
A person like you shouldn't be here.

472
00:32:27,352 --> 00:32:28,422
What?

473
00:32:29,451 --> 00:32:30,592
Like me?

474
00:32:31,092 --> 00:32:32,592
What? Like me?

475
00:32:33,362 --> 00:32:34,622
You lowlife.

476
00:32:35,322 --> 00:32:37,332
I told you to stay out of my sight.

477
00:32:38,092 --> 00:32:39,662
Why you little...

478
00:32:39,931 --> 00:32:41,132
You little punk.

479
00:32:41,902 --> 00:32:43,970
Come here, you punk. Who are you?

480
00:32:43,971 --> 00:32:45,301
Please stop, Professor.

481
00:32:45,302 --> 00:32:47,341
Who are you, punk? Who do you think you are?

482
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:49,301
- Professor. Stop. - Get over here.

483
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:51,040
Come here, punk.

484
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:52,980
- I said come here! - Please stop!

485
00:32:52,981 --> 00:32:55,740
- Come here, punk. Let go! - Please calm down, sir.

486
00:32:55,741 --> 00:32:58,111
Get over here, punk!

487
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:00,152
- Come here! - You stop too.

488
00:33:01,221 --> 00:33:03,451
Who is it? Tell me.

489
00:33:03,822 --> 00:33:05,351
Tell me who did this!

490
00:33:05,352 --> 00:33:06,960
Tell me his name right now.

491
00:33:06,961 --> 00:33:10,031
We're going to get all of our friends together to kill him.

492
00:33:10,431 --> 00:33:12,961
Are you a gangster? In what area?

493
00:33:13,062 --> 00:33:15,731
I know most of the gangsters in and around Seoul.

494
00:33:17,471 --> 00:33:19,431
She used to be a police detective.

495
00:33:20,771 --> 00:33:22,072
Hey, Kang Ja.

496
00:33:23,112 --> 00:33:25,642
We're not gangsters. Right, Jo Gab?

497
00:33:26,642 --> 00:33:28,210
- Jo Gab? - Oh, what?

498
00:33:28,211 --> 00:33:29,710
We're really nice, right?

499
00:33:29,711 --> 00:33:30,951
Of course, we're nice.

500
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:34,152
Let's be nice and bring some yummy food.

501
00:33:35,882 --> 00:33:37,422
What do you like?

502
00:33:38,991 --> 00:33:40,721
- All of it. - Of course.

503
00:33:43,261 --> 00:33:45,191
Gosh. She wants to eat everything.

504
00:33:45,892 --> 00:33:47,062
Save me...

505
00:33:47,562 --> 00:33:50,771
I hate getting in the middle of other people's business.

506
00:33:51,201 --> 00:33:53,971
But let me ask one question. Did you see or didn't you?

507
00:33:54,302 --> 00:33:55,342
What?

508
00:33:55,672 --> 00:33:58,210
Professor Seo had a similar incident last year.

509
00:33:58,211 --> 00:34:00,141
It ended with the girl leaving the school.

510
00:34:00,142 --> 00:34:02,381
That's right. It's a habit.

511
00:34:02,382 --> 00:34:04,481
They don't just suddenly start.

512
00:34:05,312 --> 00:34:07,481
Hey. Look me in the eyes.

513
00:34:09,122 --> 00:34:10,352
Look me straight in the eyes.

514
00:34:10,422 --> 00:34:13,322
Did you see Professor Seo do something or not?

515
00:34:17,191 --> 00:34:19,031
It's true that Se Ryeon misunderstood,

516
00:34:19,032 --> 00:34:22,001
and Professor Seo isn't a molester. That's a fact.

517
00:34:23,632 --> 00:34:27,041
And I no longer want to be involved in this.

518
00:34:27,402 --> 00:34:29,771
I can't let this mess up my life.

519
00:34:43,422 --> 00:34:44,952
These kids are so scary.

520
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,560
You can tell what kind of people they are by looking at their family.

521
00:34:47,561 --> 00:34:50,230
Seriously. What is she thinking, making up lies...

522
00:34:50,231 --> 00:34:51,761
and framing Professor Seo?

523
00:34:51,762 --> 00:34:55,302
She wrote that she'll seek legal action. How cute.

524
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:57,131
What did Director Baek say?

525
00:34:57,132 --> 00:34:58,770
He didn't say much.

526
00:34:58,771 --> 00:35:00,940
You know he doesn't like messy things.

527
00:35:00,941 --> 00:35:03,041
He dislikes getting his hands dirty even more.

528
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:05,640
We can wrap things up ourselves.

529
00:35:05,641 --> 00:35:09,210
Let's go back to limiting candidates from certain schools next year.

530
00:35:09,211 --> 00:35:10,411
Yes, let's.

531
00:35:10,682 --> 00:35:13,182
That's how she stayed there until the end.

532
00:35:13,682 --> 00:35:17,052
I hated seeing how desperate she was.

533
00:35:17,322 --> 00:35:19,661
Na Se Ryeon is in Group Eight, right?

534
00:35:20,422 --> 00:35:22,561
The dregs of the entire class that we dumped on Oh Soo Jae.

535
00:35:24,592 --> 00:35:27,031
Please don't be late for meetings.

536
00:35:27,032 --> 00:35:29,560
Is my group the dregs of the class?

537
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:30,971
Na Se Ryeon.

538
00:35:30,972 --> 00:35:34,501
You're her supervisor. Make sure she apologizes to Professor Seo.

539
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:37,171
- Why should I? - She keeps making things up...

540
00:35:37,172 --> 00:35:39,370
and making trouble for Professor Seo.

541
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:41,041
Professor Jung,

542
00:35:41,441 --> 00:35:44,152
it's easy to forget you used to be a judge.

543
00:35:44,552 --> 00:35:45,611
What?

544
00:35:45,612 --> 00:35:48,751
Okay. About Na Se Ryeon. If there's no other way,

545
00:35:49,052 --> 00:35:51,620
let's suspend her or have her drop out.

546
00:35:51,621 --> 00:35:54,190
I mean, if you went to that kind of place with your professor,

547
00:35:54,191 --> 00:35:57,531
you should lift the mood and shake the tambourine at least.

548
00:35:57,532 --> 00:36:00,101
She's making this mess when she went there voluntarily?

549
00:36:07,601 --> 00:36:11,141
I thought my colleagues were dirty, but professors are no joke either.

550
00:36:11,941 --> 00:36:14,810
But I guess everyone is basically the same...

551
00:36:14,811 --> 00:36:18,251
since our community is so small. Don't you think?

552
00:36:21,422 --> 00:36:23,691
- That... - Goodness.

553
00:36:24,492 --> 00:36:26,052
Pathetic losers.

554
00:36:26,691 --> 00:36:28,321
(Seojung University)

555
00:36:28,322 --> 00:36:29,492
Professor.

556
00:36:32,092 --> 00:36:33,331
Help me.

557
00:36:34,101 --> 00:36:36,501
I want an apology from Professor Seo.

558
00:36:38,472 --> 00:36:39,742
That's not going to happen for you.

559
00:36:44,972 --> 00:36:46,271
Last spring...

560
00:36:47,411 --> 00:36:49,480
You're the girl from General Affairs who got fired...

561
00:36:49,481 --> 00:36:50,551
after reporting to management...

562
00:36:50,552 --> 00:36:51,981
that she was sexually harassed by an intern lawyer.

563
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:54,121
That's you, right?

564
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:59,251
You should've learned from experience.

565
00:36:59,452 --> 00:37:00,761
You let it happen again?

566
00:37:00,762 --> 00:37:02,362
And you want me to help you?

567
00:37:04,132 --> 00:37:05,661
In Korea,

568
00:37:06,061 --> 00:37:09,100
the law isn't on the woman's side when she gets sexually assaulted.

569
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,601
Do you think school is going to be any different?

570
00:37:11,932 --> 00:37:14,540
You should be the one to apologize to Professor Seo...

571
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:17,310
for putting up a poster and posting the audio file.

572
00:37:17,311 --> 00:37:18,371
Beg.

573
00:37:19,981 --> 00:37:22,981
Get him to forgive you no matter what. That's the answer.

574
00:37:23,351 --> 00:37:26,251
You could be sued for defamation and get expelled.

575
00:37:26,952 --> 00:37:29,350
You didn't come to law school just for that to happen.

576
00:37:29,351 --> 00:37:31,592
Just focus...

577
00:37:33,862 --> 00:37:35,121
on why you came here.

578
00:37:45,702 --> 00:37:46,802
Professor.

579
00:37:50,211 --> 00:37:54,041
Se Ryeon didn't do anything wrong. Why did you tell her to apologize?

580
00:37:55,742 --> 00:37:57,981
You know Professor Seo. That day, you also...

581
00:38:02,521 --> 00:38:03,652
I thought I told you...

582
00:38:04,452 --> 00:38:06,021
to forget what you saw that day...

583
00:38:07,992 --> 00:38:10,061
and to stay out of my business.

584
00:38:11,731 --> 00:38:13,901
I told you I don't like people getting in my business.

585
00:38:13,902 --> 00:38:15,432
I don't like you, Professor.

586
00:38:18,972 --> 00:38:21,242
I don't know what you have done for TK Law Firm.

587
00:38:21,941 --> 00:38:24,041
I don't know how you've lived your life.

588
00:38:25,141 --> 00:38:27,441
But asking Se Ryeon to apologize to someone like Professor Seo...

589
00:38:28,481 --> 00:38:29,911
That's so not cool.

590
00:38:31,652 --> 00:38:33,481
That's not who you really are.

591
00:38:36,691 --> 00:38:37,750
Who I really am?

592
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:40,922
If we let this go, Professor Seo will do this again.

593
00:38:41,161 --> 00:38:44,661
Then it won't be Professor Seo's fault. It'll be ours.

594
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:46,961
Do you want that to happen?

595
00:38:47,802 --> 00:38:49,132
That's really not cool.

596
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:52,500
Se Ryeon doesn't have any power, so when she gets angry,

597
00:38:52,501 --> 00:38:54,572
nobody listens and she only gets attacked.

598
00:38:55,902 --> 00:38:57,742
But you have power, Professor.

599
00:38:58,742 --> 00:39:00,282
Use your power to get angry.

600
00:39:00,682 --> 00:39:03,652
Professor, you used to be a cool person.

601
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:06,182
You.

602
00:39:10,992 --> 00:39:12,791
Do you like Na Se Ryeon?

603
00:39:14,661 --> 00:39:16,861
Do you like Na Se Ryeon? Is that why you're saying this?

604
00:39:16,862 --> 00:39:18,190
No. It's not that...

605
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:21,161
If you want to do something for the girl you like,

606
00:39:22,202 --> 00:39:24,032
you need something undeniable.

607
00:39:24,831 --> 00:39:28,101
If you want to beat Professor Seo, find undeniable evidence.

608
00:39:28,371 --> 00:39:30,710
What good is a poster or an audio file?

609
00:39:30,711 --> 00:39:33,282
If I bring something undeniable for the girl I like,

610
00:39:33,911 --> 00:39:35,282
are you going to help?

611
00:39:53,661 --> 00:39:57,101
I really didn't want to get involved.

612
00:39:57,501 --> 00:39:58,632
Ms. Oh.

613
00:39:59,572 --> 00:40:03,612
Things are so tough for my son-in-law.

614
00:40:06,941 --> 00:40:08,612
What do I do, Mom?

615
00:40:08,941 --> 00:40:10,152
Goodness.

616
00:40:14,981 --> 00:40:18,291
My daughter hasn't been able to eat for days.

617
00:40:20,362 --> 00:40:24,431
My husband is the sweetest dad to my daughters.

618
00:40:24,432 --> 00:40:27,600
My daughters are so shocked that they can't even go to school...

619
00:40:27,601 --> 00:40:29,061
and have stopped eating.

620
00:40:30,132 --> 00:40:32,770
I gave Director Baek Jin Ki a call...

621
00:40:32,771 --> 00:40:35,141
to set up a meeting to sort things out.

622
00:40:36,441 --> 00:40:38,512
We can really use your help, Ms. Oh.

623
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:41,210
And you will handsomely be repaid for your effort.

624
00:40:41,211 --> 00:40:43,111
Don't you know that...

625
00:40:43,112 --> 00:40:45,512
my company is about to renew the contract with TK?

626
00:40:45,581 --> 00:40:46,922
Yes, ma'am.

627
00:40:49,452 --> 00:40:52,290
He said he was a law professor and used to be a prosecutor.

628
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:54,290
He acted like a complete snob.

629
00:40:54,291 --> 00:40:56,861
He demanded I hand it over or delete the footage.

630
00:40:56,862 --> 00:40:59,460
So I pretended to delete everything...

631
00:40:59,461 --> 00:41:01,000
and put aside the footage.

632
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:03,000
I knew you would help us.

633
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:06,202
You were super quick at catching on to things in prison too.

634
00:41:06,532 --> 00:41:09,302
You just saved a law student's life.

635
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:12,841
Chan, the universe is really on our side this time.

636
00:41:12,842 --> 00:41:15,012
Who knew he was the owner of this establishment?

637
00:41:15,411 --> 00:41:17,111
Thank you, sir.

638
00:41:17,112 --> 00:41:20,282
Use that to put away that snobbish jerk for good.

639
00:41:20,452 --> 00:41:21,621
Will do.

640
00:41:40,141 --> 00:41:42,841
You. Look me in the eyes.

641
00:41:42,842 --> 00:41:45,072
Look me in the eyes and say it again. Be honest.

642
00:41:48,081 --> 00:41:50,512
I'm sorry. I'll do anything you ask.

643
00:41:51,211 --> 00:41:53,351
Watching Se Ryeon has been torture.

644
00:41:54,722 --> 00:41:56,351
Go ahead and just kill me.

645
00:41:57,992 --> 00:41:59,250
That hurts! Wait.

646
00:41:59,251 --> 00:42:02,191
Hey, Kang Ja. My hair is starting to thin out!

647
00:42:03,191 --> 00:42:05,391
Hey, I have a boil on my butt.

648
00:42:05,762 --> 00:42:07,362
You're unbelievable!

649
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,132
Why did you do it?

650
00:42:12,271 --> 00:42:14,141
You knew Se Ryeon was going through this all alone.

651
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:18,141
Well,

652
00:42:19,342 --> 00:42:21,911
as soon as I debuted as an idol singer at 17, it flopped.

653
00:42:22,242 --> 00:42:24,611
Ever since I was a teenager, my life was royally messed up.

654
00:42:24,612 --> 00:42:26,512
Nothing went my way, and I did my best to survive.

655
00:42:27,922 --> 00:42:29,682
And it took a lot of hard work to get to where I am now.

656
00:42:31,322 --> 00:42:32,822
Kang Ja. Yoon Sang.

657
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:35,821
Do you know why I came to law school?

658
00:42:35,822 --> 00:42:37,061
- Why? - Why?

659
00:42:38,191 --> 00:42:39,931
- The President. - What a nut job.

660
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,362
I'm serious!

661
00:42:42,932 --> 00:42:45,201
I barely got into law school.

662
00:42:45,202 --> 00:42:46,330
The student council president said...

663
00:42:46,331 --> 00:42:47,802
I could get expelled if I said the wrong thing.

664
00:42:47,972 --> 00:42:49,572
And things started to snowball.

665
00:42:50,371 --> 00:42:52,211
I didn't want my life to get messed up again.

666
00:42:53,411 --> 00:42:54,512
Gosh.

667
00:42:59,581 --> 00:43:00,722
Se Ryeon.

668
00:43:01,722 --> 00:43:03,790
My husband is a fool for our daughters.

669
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:06,322
He would never sexually harass anyone.

670
00:43:06,521 --> 00:43:09,661
And I'm a judge. I swear on my career...

671
00:43:31,211 --> 00:43:34,121
What are you doing? You can't interrupt our meeting.

672
00:43:34,581 --> 00:43:36,051
What's going on?

673
00:43:36,052 --> 00:43:37,521
We have something to show you.

674
00:43:50,101 --> 00:43:51,632
What is that?

675
00:44:08,422 --> 00:44:12,091
Have you gone mad? How dare you bring this garbage in?

676
00:44:12,092 --> 00:44:14,121
I don't think you can call this garbage.

677
00:44:14,691 --> 00:44:15,722
What?

678
00:44:17,932 --> 00:44:21,000
Evidence that wasn't obtained through the proper channel...

679
00:44:21,001 --> 00:44:22,501
can't be admissible.

680
00:44:23,331 --> 00:44:24,901
I'm sure you know that much.

681
00:44:24,902 --> 00:44:27,101
We're not in court. We're at school, sir.

682
00:44:28,302 --> 00:44:30,842
School should be different.

683
00:44:34,512 --> 00:44:37,151
Professor, you were once caught with a prostitute...

684
00:44:37,152 --> 00:44:38,612
when you were a prosecutor.

685
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:41,381
What? Where did you hear that nonsense?

686
00:44:41,382 --> 00:44:42,851
Nonsense?

687
00:44:43,751 --> 00:44:46,251
One of my junior cops was in the vice squad.

688
00:44:46,751 --> 00:44:49,061
And he still remembers you clearly.

689
00:44:50,731 --> 00:44:53,230
At the time, Prosecutor Seo was caught red-handed...

690
00:44:53,231 --> 00:44:55,331
when they raided the scene.

691
00:44:56,001 --> 00:44:58,471
- And your last name is Seo. - Are you out of your mind?

692
00:44:58,472 --> 00:45:00,100
You should have behaved yourself once you became a law professor...

693
00:45:00,101 --> 00:45:01,742
after resigning from your office.

694
00:45:02,141 --> 00:45:03,612
In March 2019,

695
00:45:03,641 --> 00:45:05,641
you sexually assaulted a TA in the school's research center.

696
00:45:05,811 --> 00:45:07,182
In June 2020, you sexually harassed a student.

697
00:45:07,242 --> 00:45:09,641
"You're pretty. Let's go for a drive."

698
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:11,512
In May 2021, you forced yourself...

699
00:45:11,612 --> 00:45:13,822
on a female student against her will at the student orientation.

700
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:16,882
- And there's plenty more. - Don't listen to them, honey.

701
00:45:17,922 --> 00:45:20,291
They are talking nonsense. They are making stuff up.

702
00:45:21,621 --> 00:45:24,261
Since these students aren't here to testify in person,

703
00:45:24,262 --> 00:45:25,890
they can't be used as evidence.

704
00:45:25,891 --> 00:45:28,761
And you collected the footage at the karaoke improperly.

705
00:45:28,762 --> 00:45:30,802
You want to use that to prove my husband guilty?

706
00:45:30,932 --> 00:45:32,500
In the footage,

707
00:45:32,501 --> 00:45:33,741
Na Se Ryeon emerged from the room...

708
00:45:33,742 --> 00:45:35,672
where my husband came out while clutching onto her clothes.

709
00:45:36,202 --> 00:45:37,271
That's all you have.

710
00:45:37,371 --> 00:45:38,841
That's right, Director.

711
00:45:38,842 --> 00:45:42,141
This footage won't be enough to prove that he's guilty.

712
00:45:42,382 --> 00:45:44,411
This won't even be acknowledged in court.

713
00:45:45,152 --> 00:45:46,311
Ms. Oh.

714
00:45:48,251 --> 00:45:49,652
What do you think?

715
00:45:53,862 --> 00:45:55,762
I would like to discuss this...

716
00:45:56,691 --> 00:45:58,291
in private.

717
00:46:01,961 --> 00:46:03,461
I want to discuss this openly.

718
00:46:04,632 --> 00:46:06,032
That will be better.

719
00:46:06,271 --> 00:46:07,672
If you insist.

720
00:46:26,791 --> 00:46:30,390
My goodness. What is this? What am I seeing?

721
00:46:30,391 --> 00:46:32,762
Wait. Professor Seo just...

722
00:46:36,061 --> 00:46:38,501
On the day of the Seojung University Law School Night,

723
00:46:39,132 --> 00:46:42,040
Professor Seo sexually harassed me in the hotel hallway.

724
00:46:42,041 --> 00:46:45,511
I, the victim of this harassment, asked the hotel for cooperation.

725
00:46:45,512 --> 00:46:47,512
I collected the evidence legally.

726
00:46:53,052 --> 00:46:54,121
What do you think?

727
00:46:54,722 --> 00:46:58,691
Do you think this evidence is enough to find him guilty?

728
00:47:01,021 --> 00:47:03,691
No. I was just grabbing her, so we could have a drink.

729
00:47:06,661 --> 00:47:09,501
Professor Seo, I can't look the other way anymore.

730
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:11,972
Everyone is overreacting about what I did.

731
00:47:12,771 --> 00:47:15,341
When guys get drunk, they make mistakes and so on.

732
00:47:15,342 --> 00:47:17,001
Hey, was that so bad?

733
00:47:17,242 --> 00:47:19,071
I just wanted to get a drink with you.

734
00:47:19,072 --> 00:47:21,911
And my hand happened to be there. Should I cut off my hand?

735
00:47:22,981 --> 00:47:24,751
Fine. Yes. I touched you a bit.

736
00:47:24,952 --> 00:47:27,221
But you were the one who flirted with me first.

737
00:47:27,222 --> 00:47:29,382
You weren't acting very modest, so I touched you. So what?

738
00:47:29,751 --> 00:47:32,120
- Professor! - Professor Seo.

739
00:47:32,121 --> 00:47:34,521
- What's wrong with him? - Gosh.

740
00:47:36,621 --> 00:47:39,391
You just confessed that you sexually harassed Na Se Ryeon.

741
00:47:42,331 --> 00:47:45,101
- You did, didn't you? - Look at this jerk. Unbelievable.

742
00:47:45,231 --> 00:47:47,141
That's enough, Professor Seo.

743
00:47:47,672 --> 00:47:49,802
I'll tell the chair of the board that you had to resign...

744
00:47:49,871 --> 00:47:52,111
for a personal matter and that I accepted your resignation.

745
00:47:52,112 --> 00:47:53,112
And that's final.

746
00:48:04,251 --> 00:48:05,722
Director Baek!

747
00:48:08,222 --> 00:48:09,661
Gosh.

748
00:48:33,682 --> 00:48:34,922
That lunatic.

749
00:48:37,391 --> 00:48:38,451
When you were a public defender,

750
00:48:38,452 --> 00:48:39,821
Seo Jun Myung wiped the floor with you...

751
00:48:39,822 --> 00:48:40,891
for the Kim Dong Gu case, right?

752
00:48:42,092 --> 00:48:43,862
Did that traumatize you for the rest of your life?

753
00:48:44,561 --> 00:48:46,132
Is this your revenge?

754
00:48:47,532 --> 00:48:49,160
You were humiliated with that case,

755
00:48:49,161 --> 00:48:51,402
but you were hired by TK which was so random.

756
00:48:53,072 --> 00:48:54,802
There were rumours, you know?

757
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:58,112
"How did an under-qualified lowlife get a job there?"

758
00:48:58,711 --> 00:49:00,541
"Did she sleep with Choi Tae Guk?"

759
00:49:01,742 --> 00:49:03,341
What? Is that why you have a soft spot...

760
00:49:03,342 --> 00:49:04,351
for girls like Na Se Ryeon?

761
00:49:15,722 --> 00:49:18,391
Get your husband in order, so he doesn't do anything stupid.

762
00:49:18,932 --> 00:49:20,391
If you fail,

763
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:23,702
you'll see these photos on the courthouse website.

764
00:49:24,472 --> 00:49:26,472
I'm not going to sit back and let you do this.

765
00:49:26,702 --> 00:49:28,672
I'll file an official complaint.

766
00:49:47,391 --> 00:49:50,161
We haven't been able to find victim Jeon Na Jung's body yet.

767
00:49:50,762 --> 00:49:53,661
Considering the blood at the scene where Kim Dong Gu was arrested...

768
00:49:53,902 --> 00:49:57,230
and the victim's blood on her ripped clothes, underwear,

769
00:49:57,231 --> 00:49:58,270
and the weapon at the scene,

770
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,771
the total amount of blood she lost...

771
00:50:00,101 --> 00:50:01,871
is somewhere around 1,500cc.

772
00:50:02,742 --> 00:50:05,011
And we found Kim Dong Gu's DNA and the victim's blood...

773
00:50:05,012 --> 00:50:08,541
from the knife Kim Dong Gu was holding.

774
00:50:09,112 --> 00:50:12,811
And his DNA was found on the victim's underwear as well.

775
00:50:13,211 --> 00:50:15,451
The evidence gives us a highly likely chance...

776
00:50:15,452 --> 00:50:17,021
that he ripped the victim's clothes and raped her...

777
00:50:17,052 --> 00:50:19,621
or he at least attempted to rape her although he failed...

778
00:50:19,751 --> 00:50:23,521
and murdered the victim with the weapon.

779
00:50:23,661 --> 00:50:25,531
And right before the victim died,

780
00:50:25,532 --> 00:50:28,061
the last person she talked to on the phone was Kim Dong Gu.

781
00:50:28,501 --> 00:50:31,132
More importantly, Kim Dong Gu and the victim, Jeon Na Jung,

782
00:50:31,501 --> 00:50:33,001
weren't siblings by birth.

783
00:50:33,802 --> 00:50:36,271
They were step-siblings.

784
00:50:39,512 --> 00:50:41,941
No, Dad. I really didn't do it!

785
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:46,282
Ma'am, I didn't do it. Why would I kill Na Jung?

786
00:50:46,481 --> 00:50:48,951
It really wasn't me! I went to pick her up!

787
00:50:48,952 --> 00:50:50,521
And I saw...

788
00:50:53,152 --> 00:50:54,391
Scumbag.

789
00:50:56,422 --> 00:50:57,492
Die.

790
00:50:59,862 --> 00:51:01,362
Burn in a pit of fire.

791
00:51:09,601 --> 00:51:11,041
You crazy jerk.

792
00:51:32,691 --> 00:51:35,531
Get up! I told you to get up, you jerk!

793
00:51:35,532 --> 00:51:36,901
- Get up. - Gosh.

794
00:51:36,902 --> 00:51:38,972
- You crazy jerk! - You.

795
00:51:39,072 --> 00:51:42,242
So you raped your stepsister and killed her?

796
00:51:42,572 --> 00:51:43,902
You scumbag!

797
00:51:44,342 --> 00:51:46,841
You're not even human, you jerk!

798
00:51:46,842 --> 00:51:50,141
- Come here. - We don't need trash like you here.

799
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:52,811
Right. I did it.

800
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:54,722
I killed her.

801
00:51:55,882 --> 00:51:58,722
Fine! I killed her!

802
00:51:59,222 --> 00:52:01,262
I killed her and dumped her in the ocean. So what?

803
00:52:02,061 --> 00:52:04,031
- Get off me! - You jerk.

804
00:52:04,032 --> 00:52:05,460
- Come here. - Come on.

805
00:52:05,461 --> 00:52:07,831
Come here, you jerk.

806
00:52:08,302 --> 00:52:09,601
- You scumbag. - Jerk.

807
00:52:11,271 --> 00:52:12,730
Hold on.

808
00:52:12,731 --> 00:52:15,801
If you keep this up, you're going to kill him.

809
00:52:15,802 --> 00:52:18,071
- Yong Chul, stop beating him up. - Darn it.

810
00:52:18,072 --> 00:52:21,241
All right. Let's go back to playing cards. Come on.

811
00:52:21,242 --> 00:52:23,682
- Darn you. - Let's play cards.

812
00:52:24,012 --> 00:52:25,981
Yong Chul. Come here.

813
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,851
Darn it.

814
00:53:01,782 --> 00:53:03,021
Why did you do it?

815
00:53:04,592 --> 00:53:05,952
The security footage.

816
00:53:07,152 --> 00:53:08,922
You didn't have to go that far.

817
00:53:11,632 --> 00:53:13,331
I didn't want to be "not cool".

818
00:53:20,902 --> 00:53:22,302
You were really cool.

819
00:53:24,811 --> 00:53:26,572
Do you want to eat with me?

820
00:53:28,981 --> 00:53:30,012
What?

821
00:53:30,581 --> 00:53:33,112
Well, that would be inappropriate, right?

822
00:53:34,351 --> 00:53:35,682
I guess you don't like that.

823
00:54:01,342 --> 00:54:03,382
I didn't do it because I liked Se Ryeon.

00:54:07,751 --> 00:54:09,222
I like you, Professor.

00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:52,822

So we don't get lost.

I kept my promise.

834
00:56:35,101 --> 00:56:37,000
A year ago, the murder of a middle school girl...

835
00:56:37,001 --> 00:56:38,471
shocked the nation.

836
00:56:38,472 --> 00:56:40,031
And the real culprit of the case was caught recently.

837
00:56:40,032 --> 00:56:43,040
The culprit wasn't her stepbrother. He wasn't even on the suspect list.

838
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:44,411
He wasn't even questioned.

839
00:56:44,572 --> 00:56:46,770
The real culprit was arrested after a year...

840
00:56:46,771 --> 00:56:48,980
The real culprit, No Byung Chul, was apprehended.

841
00:56:48,981 --> 00:56:51,710
- The wrongfully prosecuted... - But the prosecution claimed...

842
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:53,410
their investigation and the trial were conducted properly.

843
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:56,421
After the arrest, Kim Dong Gu was able to prove his innocence...

844
00:56:56,422 --> 00:56:58,520
from the rape and murder charge of his stepsister...

845
00:56:58,521 --> 00:57:00,290
- and clear his felony record. - There he is.

846
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,891
- Congratulations on getting out! - Congratulations.

847
00:57:03,121 --> 00:57:04,660
- Over here. - Here.

848
00:57:04,661 --> 00:57:06,191
Tell us how you feel.

849
00:57:07,032 --> 00:57:08,761
What do you plan to do next?

850
00:57:08,762 --> 00:57:10,801
How does it feel to be released with the acquittal?

851
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:12,871
- Kim Dong Gu! - Tell us how you feel.

852
00:57:15,172 --> 00:57:16,600
How dare you come out?

853
00:57:16,601 --> 00:57:19,241
I still haven't found my daughter. Why are you out here?

854
00:57:19,242 --> 00:57:21,640
Why are you here? How dare you come out?

855
00:57:21,641 --> 00:57:24,911
Why are you out here? Bring my daughter back!

856
00:57:25,081 --> 00:57:28,580
Bring her back!

857
00:57:28,581 --> 00:57:31,552
Why... Why are you...

Hello.

861
00:58:06,351 --> 00:58:08,791
I told you not to read while you're walking.

862
00:58:10,161 --> 00:58:11,161
All right.

Why do you want to come to law school?

There is...

870

someone I must find.

What are you still doing here?

876
00:59:59,601 --> 01:00:00,730
To kill myself.

877
01:00:00,731 --> 01:00:03,241
Because of you, people think I'm a gold digger.

I've been wronged, so I'm going to kill myself here.

Now that you looked into it, what do you think?

Did Park So Young die because of me?
