(and organizations portrayed in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:21,846
If you don't know where you are, tell me what you see.

4
00:00:22,745 --> 00:00:25,376
I can find you. Just tell me what you see.

5
00:01:01,085 --> 00:01:02,115
Hi, Chan.

6
00:01:02,216 --> 00:01:04,356
It's about Professor Oh. Do you know where she is?

7
00:01:04,585 --> 00:01:06,256
Where is Professor Oh now?

8
00:01:06,655 --> 00:01:08,625
Why? Did something happen?

9
00:01:08,686 --> 00:01:11,226
I heard something explode while on the phone with her. I must hurry.

10
00:01:11,295 --> 00:01:12,625
She's in danger now.

11
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:14,254
Seokpo Fishing Spot.

12
00:01:14,255 --> 00:01:17,095
She went to Seokpo Fishing Spot to meet Hong Seok Pal.

13
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:16,125
I'm calling from Seokpo Fishing Spot.

14
00:02:17,086 --> 00:02:19,195
A car just exploded and caught fire.

15
00:02:19,695 --> 00:02:22,026
Someone's been hurt. There's a chance that he's dead.

16
00:02:50,486 --> 00:02:52,996
(Episode 7)

17
00:02:56,796 --> 00:02:59,095
Hong Seok Pal's car just exploded at Seokpo Fishing Spot.

18
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:02,236
It's highly likely that he's dead. Look into it.

19
00:03:02,635 --> 00:03:03,736
What is this?

20
00:03:05,336 --> 00:03:06,336
Let's go there and find out.

21
00:03:09,776 --> 00:03:11,875
(For now, Hong Seok Pal is the prime suspect.)

22
00:03:14,646 --> 00:03:16,216
It looks like a fire broke out over there.

23
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:30,466
Please make a U-turn.

24
00:03:30,665 --> 00:03:33,266
- What? - I must follow that car.

25
00:03:33,396 --> 00:03:34,766
Hurry. Make a U-turn now.

26
00:03:35,105 --> 00:03:36,605
Gosh, what is going on?

27
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:11,905
I'll drive. Get out of the car.

28
00:04:12,505 --> 00:04:13,806
How did you find me here?

29
00:04:15,746 --> 00:04:17,475
You look like you're about to faint.

30
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:19,046
Come on. Get out.

31
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:21,515
Hey! Do you think you own this road?

32
00:04:31,426 --> 00:04:33,455
Are you not hurt? Are you all right?

33
00:04:38,996 --> 00:04:41,666
My gosh, Ms. Oh. Why didn't you pick up earlier?

34
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,635
I'm headed to the fishing spot now too.

35
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:47,505
Anyway, why did Hong Seok Pal's car suddenly explode?

36
00:04:48,406 --> 00:04:49,906
But before that, are you all right?

37
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:51,546
Yes, I'm okay.

38
00:04:53,116 --> 00:04:55,846
No. I'm on my way home now.

39
00:04:57,856 --> 00:05:01,116
Yes. He contacted me first, asking to meet up.

40
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,726
That's why I went there, but his car suddenly exploded.

41
00:05:06,596 --> 00:05:08,565
How are we going to put together a list of suspects?

42
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:10,596
Is there anyone in particular that you suspect?

43
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:12,536
Hong Seok Pal.

44
00:05:13,866 --> 00:05:16,036
Who's Hong Seok Pal?

45
00:05:17,065 --> 00:05:19,305
The owner of the hostess bar Park So Young worked at.

46
00:05:19,306 --> 00:05:20,605
What? Really?

47
00:05:20,606 --> 00:05:23,676
I watched all the videos that people took at the scene that day.

48
00:05:34,656 --> 00:05:36,686
Don't you remember seeing him elsewhere?

49
00:05:37,356 --> 00:05:39,096
Oh, he's that guy!

50
00:05:51,406 --> 00:05:52,406
My gosh.

51
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:55,046
So he broke into Professor Oh's building...

52
00:05:55,306 --> 00:05:57,005
and stole Park So Young's phone?

53
00:05:57,246 --> 00:06:00,346
He owns the hostess bar where Park So Young worked...

54
00:06:00,746 --> 00:06:04,145
and had something to do with her death.

55
00:06:04,546 --> 00:06:06,884
That's why he stole her phone.

56
00:06:06,885 --> 00:06:09,986
Okay. He must've stolen Park So Young's phone...

57
00:06:10,325 --> 00:06:12,894
because something on that phone could put him at a disadvantage.

58
00:06:12,895 --> 00:06:16,195
But why did that man, Hong Seok Pal, break into Professor Oh's building?

59
00:06:17,226 --> 00:06:19,365
He's not connected to Professor Oh in any way.

60
00:06:19,366 --> 00:06:21,166
I bet it was because of that USB flash drive.

61
00:06:21,406 --> 00:06:23,835
It contains Hansu Group's top-secret files.

62
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:26,375
Rumour has it that Hong Seok Pal has been working...

63
00:06:26,476 --> 00:06:29,976
for Chairman Han as his henchman who does his dirty work.

64
00:06:30,106 --> 00:06:34,214
I see. Hansu must've ordered him to bring it to them.

65
00:06:34,215 --> 00:06:36,215
That would be the most logical guess,

66
00:06:36,445 --> 00:06:40,315
but he's working for TK Law Firm, not Hansu.

67
00:06:41,385 --> 00:06:42,425
What?

68
00:06:42,426 --> 00:06:45,556
Choi Ju Wan, TK's managing partner.

69
00:06:45,726 --> 00:06:49,495
What? So these people were all involved in it?

70
00:06:49,496 --> 00:06:51,835
Darn, I can't believe he is the managing partner of the firm.

71
00:06:52,236 --> 00:06:54,465
That crazy scumbag.

72
00:06:56,465 --> 00:06:59,705
We'll deal with the breaking and entering case later.

73
00:06:59,906 --> 00:07:01,805
Let's identify the murder suspect first.

74
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:03,106
That's more urgent.

75
00:07:03,645 --> 00:07:07,546
If Hong Seok Pal indeed killed Park So Young...

76
00:07:08,546 --> 00:07:10,985
You know, that thing. The prenatal paternity test.

77
00:07:10,986 --> 00:07:12,786
It might have had something to do with it.

78
00:07:13,056 --> 00:07:14,925
The fact that she got a prenatal paternity test done...

79
00:07:14,926 --> 00:07:17,485
means the man denied being the father of her baby,

80
00:07:17,486 --> 00:07:21,426
which tells us that the pregnancy made him very uncomfortable.

81
00:07:21,796 --> 00:07:22,796
Bingo.

82
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:26,366
And it tells us that there's a high chance that he was...

83
00:07:26,436 --> 00:07:30,465
one of her customers at the bar or her sugar daddy.

84
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:36,275
Someone who would take a big hit if word got out.

85
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:38,145
For example,

86
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,546
the VVIPs at the hostess bar.

87
00:07:41,715 --> 00:07:43,686
You know everything, don't you?

88
00:07:44,786 --> 00:07:46,856
Anyway, who are the VVIPs?

89
00:07:51,895 --> 00:07:54,695
Han Sung Bum, the chairman of Hansu Group.

90
00:07:55,265 --> 00:07:57,596
"Together for Our Future". Assemblyman Lee In Soo.

91
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:00,536
And the last one is...

92
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:03,505
Choi Tae Guk, the chairman of TK Law Firm.

93
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:11,715
But that's too much of a stretch, don't you think?

94
00:08:12,846 --> 00:08:13,975
The head of a conglomerate,

95
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:15,645
a law firm chairman, and a presidential candidate...

96
00:08:16,015 --> 00:08:18,454
ordered a hostess bar owner...

97
00:08:18,455 --> 00:08:20,015
to kill a girl who worked there?

98
00:08:20,755 --> 00:08:22,056
Okay, let's say that's true.

99
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:24,856
But they chose to do it in TK's rooftop garden?

100
00:08:26,356 --> 00:08:28,565
Don't you think this theory is a little too far-fetched?

101
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,866
Exactly. Why there, of all places?

102
00:08:32,036 --> 00:08:33,564
I mean, it'd make them uncomfortable.

103
00:08:33,565 --> 00:08:37,136
Hong Seok Pal had the means to track her down in real time.

104
00:08:38,006 --> 00:08:41,305
He must've followed her, knowing that she was headed to TK.

105
00:08:41,306 --> 00:08:43,646
So he followed her all the way there.

106
00:08:44,105 --> 00:08:46,245
Then for some reason...

107
00:08:46,845 --> 00:08:47,945
He ended up pushing her?

108
00:08:49,016 --> 00:08:50,516
Well, it's not impossible.

109
00:08:51,485 --> 00:08:52,955
Maybe it was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

110
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,526
Or maybe they got into a fight.

111
00:08:55,585 --> 00:08:57,855
We should keep an open mind to all possibilities.

112
00:08:58,126 --> 00:09:01,026
Hong Seok Pal and the VVIPs at the hostess bar.

113
00:09:01,095 --> 00:09:03,126
You may find this information helpful.

114
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:08,235
Rumour has it that Park So Young and Chairman Han were quite close.

115
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,365
People in that industry say so.

116
00:09:12,506 --> 00:09:14,176
That's gross.

117
00:09:15,406 --> 00:09:17,574
But I'll start at the clinic where Park So Young used to go.

118
00:09:17,575 --> 00:09:19,714
- My belly is getting so big. - I'm sure...

119
00:09:19,715 --> 00:09:21,984
she mentioned something about the father of the baby.

120
00:09:21,985 --> 00:09:23,785
Jin Myung, do you like iced vanilla lattes?

121
00:09:23,786 --> 00:09:25,584
I'll find out what Chairman Han was up to...

122
00:09:25,585 --> 00:09:27,756
the night Park So Young died.

123
00:09:27,855 --> 00:09:29,556
I still have my sources.

124
00:09:31,056 --> 00:09:32,525
Who ordered fried chicken?

125
00:09:32,526 --> 00:09:34,256
- Did you order this? - We didn't order fried chicken.

126
00:09:34,355 --> 00:09:37,026
Then Chun Poong and I will look into Hong Seok Pal.

127
00:09:37,896 --> 00:09:39,465
I'm a good actor, you know.

128
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:40,995
You can totally count on me, Chan.

129
00:09:41,835 --> 00:09:43,835
(Seokpo Fishing Spot)

130
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:49,844
(Legal Clinic Center)

131
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:52,915
I heard it from the coordinator at Park So Young's OB-GYN clinic.

132
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:55,886
She said the father of the baby was super rich.

133
00:09:56,046 --> 00:09:58,614
Park So Young took a cab in front of the hostess bar.

134
00:09:58,615 --> 00:10:00,255
And I confirmed that...

135
00:10:00,256 --> 00:10:01,854
Hong Seok Pal took his car to follow her soon after.

136
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,825
For now, Hong Seok Pal is the prime suspect.

137
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,725
It was Hong Seok Pal.

138
00:10:06,995 --> 00:10:10,495
The person who broke into your building and hurt you.

139
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:13,495
The one who stole Park So Young's phone at her sister's place.

140
00:10:14,436 --> 00:10:15,735
It was all him.

141
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,365
I know.

142
00:10:18,475 --> 00:10:20,536
He visited the firm a few days ago.

143
00:10:21,306 --> 00:10:23,605
He said he had something to say about Park So Young.

144
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:27,015
He caused a scene and insisted that he must meet with Chairman Choi,

145
00:10:27,016 --> 00:10:28,485
but he was forced to leave.

146
00:10:28,585 --> 00:10:30,046
Something about Park So Young?

147
00:10:30,115 --> 00:10:32,656
I gave him my business card when I ran into him,

148
00:10:33,756 --> 00:10:37,656
implying that he could call me if he had anything to say about her.

149
00:10:39,296 --> 00:10:40,955
Then he called me.

150
00:10:43,695 --> 00:10:46,595
"Park So Young. What if I killed her?"

151
00:10:47,465 --> 00:10:48,465
"What?"

152
00:10:49,906 --> 00:10:52,506
When I got there, I saw Hong Seok Pal...

153
00:10:53,176 --> 00:10:54,876
sitting in the driver's seat.

154
00:10:55,445 --> 00:10:58,845
As I was walking toward him, he suddenly collapsed to the side.

155
00:11:00,646 --> 00:11:02,245
It was so sudden that I couldn't do anything.

156
00:11:02,386 --> 00:11:04,245
Does it mean he took his own life?

157
00:11:06,115 --> 00:11:08,886
Because he felt a pang of guilt about killing Park So Young?

158
00:11:09,156 --> 00:11:10,186
I'm not sure.

159
00:11:11,995 --> 00:11:14,855
Why? Did what I just said get your attention now?

160
00:11:15,095 --> 00:11:18,064
I get it. You're partially responsible...

161
00:11:18,065 --> 00:11:19,595
for the way she died.

162
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:21,135
What are you talking about?

163
00:11:21,136 --> 00:11:24,006
Come find me at Seokpo Fishing Spot now.

164
00:11:26,136 --> 00:11:28,945
Does it make sense that he said this when he was planning his suicide?

165
00:11:29,306 --> 00:11:31,046
He said you were partially responsible.

166
00:11:31,876 --> 00:11:34,146
So maybe, he was trying to deliberately put you in danger too?

167
00:11:35,786 --> 00:11:37,215
I'm talking about the car explosion.

168
00:11:38,146 --> 00:11:39,916
You could've gotten hurt too.

169
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:44,955
What if he didn't kill himself?

170
00:11:46,896 --> 00:11:48,526
Just like Park So Young,

171
00:11:49,195 --> 00:11:51,426
what if it's murder disguised as suicide?

172
00:12:02,546 --> 00:12:04,845
You should get going. It's getting late.

173
00:12:32,006 --> 00:12:34,806
My housekeeper put it there, but I don't have a green thumb.

174
00:12:36,676 --> 00:12:39,046
You should really get going now. I'm fine.

175
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,585
You have a big couch.

176
00:12:48,825 --> 00:12:49,825
What?

177
00:12:53,426 --> 00:12:54,756
What are you doing here?

178
00:12:56,195 --> 00:12:57,365
I need to get some sleep.

179
00:12:59,296 --> 00:13:00,334
What?

180
00:13:00,335 --> 00:13:03,036
I'm tired. I need to sleep.

181
00:13:03,105 --> 00:13:06,675
What? If you're doing this because you're worried about me,

182
00:13:06,676 --> 00:13:08,345
you can just go home. I'm really okay now.

183
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:14,215
One moment.

184
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,786
What's he doing?

185
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,666
She has such a nice bed. Why would she be cold in this room?

186
00:13:39,536 --> 00:13:42,445
Let me borrow this blanket. I'm cold.

187
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:50,786
Hey, I'm really fine. You can go home.

188
00:14:17,705 --> 00:14:18,916
If he indeed took his own life,

189
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:21,916
he probably blew up his own car to hurt Professor Oh too.

190
00:14:23,345 --> 00:14:25,115
But if it's murder disguised as suicide...

191
00:14:25,985 --> 00:14:28,215
Who did it? And why?

192
00:14:29,256 --> 00:14:31,126
Why deliberately endanger Professor Oh?

193
00:14:40,936 --> 00:14:42,036
No!

194
00:14:49,345 --> 00:14:50,445
Why won't this open?

195
00:15:01,825 --> 00:15:02,985
Who are you?

196
00:15:10,595 --> 00:15:12,436
Professor Oh.

197
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:16,536
Are you all right?

198
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:19,335
Professor Oh.

199
00:15:20,636 --> 00:15:21,705
It was a dream.

200
00:16:01,615 --> 00:16:02,715
Who could it be?

201
00:16:05,016 --> 00:16:06,556
Who? And why?

202
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:10,325
Why me?

203
00:16:12,325 --> 00:16:15,595
Why? Just why?

204
00:17:00,676 --> 00:17:03,245
Why hide just to cry? It's lame.

205
00:17:06,445 --> 00:17:08,445
Why are you sitting next to me if you think I'm lame?

206
00:17:09,015 --> 00:17:10,646
Because I know that you're cool.

207
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:14,255
You just said I was lame.

208
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:19,596
We all have...

209
00:17:20,856 --> 00:17:22,866
more than one side.

210
00:17:24,396 --> 00:17:27,465
There could be dozens... No, hundreds.

211
00:17:29,606 --> 00:17:32,836
So having a couple of lame sides really isn't a big deal.

212
00:17:34,406 --> 00:17:36,176
You're still cool.

213
00:17:37,876 --> 00:17:39,715
Cool, my foot.

214
00:17:40,545 --> 00:17:41,676
So...

215
00:17:43,715 --> 00:17:45,816
just bawl your eyes out when you want to cry...

216
00:17:46,656 --> 00:17:48,555
and say that you're not okay when you're stressed.

217
00:17:51,126 --> 00:17:53,126
Even if you do that, it won't change how cool you are.

218
00:17:58,936 --> 00:18:01,166
When I barely manage to get over a hurdle,

219
00:18:01,765 --> 00:18:03,106
there's another one waiting for me.

220
00:18:04,265 --> 00:18:05,535
And another one.

221
00:18:10,545 --> 00:18:11,846
It makes me angry.

222
00:18:14,715 --> 00:18:16,816
I'm so angry at my life.

223
00:18:20,386 --> 00:18:21,955
How could this happen?

224
00:18:23,725 --> 00:18:26,096
How could this be?

225
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,096
I'm scared too.

226
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:33,965
I'm scared and exhausted too.

227
00:19:10,336 --> 00:19:14,376
(Hyundae Snack Bar, Recreational Boats)

228
00:19:14,406 --> 00:19:17,376
(Police)

229
00:19:24,785 --> 00:19:26,615
- I'm going in. - Kang Ja!

230
00:19:26,616 --> 00:19:27,686
Detective Do.

231
00:19:30,455 --> 00:19:31,626
Have you found anything?

232
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:34,995
Everything is scorched. We'll keep investigating.

233
00:19:37,495 --> 00:19:38,795
(Butane)

234
00:19:50,376 --> 00:19:51,846
I don't want you to be part of this.

235
00:19:52,146 --> 00:19:55,985
Why? I guess someone I know is on your list of suspects?

236
00:19:57,545 --> 00:20:01,356
He's working for TK Law Firm, not Hansu.

237
00:20:01,686 --> 00:20:02,985
Choi Ju Wan, TK's managing partner.

238
00:20:05,225 --> 00:20:07,396
For example, the VVIPs at the hostess bar.

239
00:20:07,955 --> 00:20:09,495
The chairman of TK Law Firm.

240
00:20:10,566 --> 00:20:11,826
Choi Tae Guk.

241
00:21:08,255 --> 00:21:10,525
Eat and sleep well.

242
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:13,096
And don't get hurt no matter what happens.

243
00:21:14,326 --> 00:21:16,326
Both physically and emotionally.

244
00:21:22,436 --> 00:21:23,606
Don't get hurt.

245
00:21:24,035 --> 00:21:27,336
Whatever happens, you have me by your side.

246
00:21:30,945 --> 00:21:32,075
Next news.

247
00:21:32,076 --> 00:21:34,715
Hong, known as the king of hostess bars in Gangnam,

248
00:21:34,846 --> 00:21:38,146
died in a car explosion at an abandoned fishing spot.

249
00:21:38,785 --> 00:21:40,554
Hong operated...

250
00:21:40,555 --> 00:21:42,985
several hostess bars all over Gangnam.

251
00:21:45,025 --> 00:21:47,025
What was Soo Jae doing there?

252
00:21:47,455 --> 00:21:48,964
Ms. Oh's vehicle heading to the fishing spot...

253
00:21:48,965 --> 00:21:51,525
was caught on a security camera nearby.

254
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:55,294
And after the explosion, her vehicle was spotted leaving too.

255
00:21:55,295 --> 00:21:57,965
Maybe, she took the same road. It could be a coincidence.

256
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,235
Right.

257
00:21:59,676 --> 00:22:02,075
I found it odd that Ms. Oh was there when he committed suicide,

258
00:22:02,076 --> 00:22:03,176
so I looked into this.

259
00:22:03,846 --> 00:22:06,775
And the last person Hong Seok Pal talked on the phone with was Ms. Oh.

260
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,445
Who called whom?

261
00:22:09,785 --> 00:22:10,985
Did you check that?

262
00:22:11,686 --> 00:22:12,916
It was Hong Seok Pal.

263
00:22:13,816 --> 00:22:16,224
They could have arranged a meeting at the fishing spot.

264
00:22:16,225 --> 00:22:18,426
I believe Ms. Oh knew something when she headed there.

265
00:22:19,995 --> 00:22:22,666
Anyway, Hong Seok Pal is dead.

266
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:24,565
And we will have to...

267
00:22:24,566 --> 00:22:27,265
interview Ms. Oh for a statement.

268
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:29,566
You should if you need to.

269
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:34,505
- By the way, Chief Kang, - Yes?

270
00:22:34,735 --> 00:22:36,805
try not to look too happy.

271
00:22:38,545 --> 00:22:41,646
Hong Seok Pal took great care of you.

272
00:22:41,676 --> 00:22:43,715
Everyone in your industry knows that.

273
00:22:44,285 --> 00:22:46,816
And I can tell you're happy that it will never come out.

274
00:22:47,086 --> 00:22:49,826
Gosh, no. That's not true.

275
00:22:50,326 --> 00:22:51,826
He never did no such thing for me.

276
00:22:52,156 --> 00:22:55,356
I just thought that Ms. Oh might be questioned by the police.

277
00:22:55,455 --> 00:22:56,895
So I wanted to give you a heads-up.

278
00:22:56,896 --> 00:22:59,764
Okay. Let's stop here today. I have a meeting.

279
00:22:59,765 --> 00:23:02,096
I see. Yes, sir.

280
00:23:24,785 --> 00:23:26,426
How come you didn't answer my calls?

281
00:23:30,695 --> 00:23:31,866
(Gong Chan)

282
00:23:32,465 --> 00:23:36,166
Were you with Soo Jae all night?

283
00:23:37,936 --> 00:23:40,606
I checked the group chatroom. They all went to the fishing spot.

284
00:23:41,436 --> 00:23:43,805
You were quiet, and I couldn't reach her either.

285
00:23:45,646 --> 00:23:47,275
Were you with her?

286
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:49,445
Yes.

287
00:23:50,445 --> 00:23:51,745
How is she?

288
00:23:58,055 --> 00:23:59,156
She's not okay.

289
00:24:01,926 --> 00:24:03,224
How could she be?

290
00:24:03,225 --> 00:24:06,765
I'm the one who should be angry. Why do you sound mad?

291
00:24:06,896 --> 00:24:08,795
- Why should you be angry? - Do you have to ask?

292
00:24:09,805 --> 00:24:11,605
Do you think you're the only one who's worried about her?

293
00:24:11,606 --> 00:24:12,676
You know,

294
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:16,505
it infuriates me that she was all alone during the explosion.

295
00:24:16,775 --> 00:24:18,305
You must know since you heard the recording.

296
00:24:19,475 --> 00:24:22,646
So it makes me so angry that she was all alone there.

297
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,014
Then why are you so angry?

298
00:24:25,015 --> 00:24:26,055
Don't tell me...

299
00:24:27,156 --> 00:24:29,485
you're angry because she was with me the whole night.

300
00:24:30,025 --> 00:24:31,554
Is that why you're angry?

301
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:32,555
Yes.

302
00:24:34,525 --> 00:24:36,165
It infuriates me that...

303
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,826
she called you instead of me when she was in danger.

304
00:24:39,035 --> 00:24:41,666
And I told her not to do that, but she still...

305
00:24:43,336 --> 00:24:45,406
called you again.

306
00:24:46,676 --> 00:24:48,436
It's driving me mad.

307
00:24:51,606 --> 00:24:53,916
And let me make this very clear.

308
00:24:54,316 --> 00:24:56,346
You'd better not suspect my father...

309
00:24:57,715 --> 00:24:59,555
and my brother without proof.

310
00:25:01,455 --> 00:25:02,484
I might hate them,

311
00:25:02,485 --> 00:25:04,156
but I won't let you accuse them falsely.

312
00:25:08,295 --> 00:25:11,396
You're suspecting them too. Aren't you?

313
00:25:14,265 --> 00:25:17,705
You're trying your best to prove that they are innocent, right?

314
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:20,705
I never suspected them.

315
00:25:21,876 --> 00:25:24,245
I'm not trying to prove their innocence.

316
00:25:32,455 --> 00:25:34,785
That sad suspect list.

317
00:25:36,525 --> 00:25:39,025
You should drop it before you get humiliated.

318
00:25:39,525 --> 00:25:41,396
There's nothing you can do now.

319
00:25:41,795 --> 00:25:44,125
Hong Seok Pal said he killed Park So Young.

320
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,295
I'll look into it.

321
00:25:46,366 --> 00:25:48,566
Hong Seok Pal said he pushed Park So Young,

322
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:51,005
but I must check if that was true.

323
00:25:51,606 --> 00:25:53,075
Then I'll check if it was his decision...

324
00:25:53,076 --> 00:25:54,376
or if someone ordered him to do so.

325
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:57,376
I'll find out if Hong Seok Pal really killed himself.

326
00:25:58,606 --> 00:26:01,775
I'll check if Park So Young's killer murdered him too.

327
00:26:02,485 --> 00:26:04,145
I'll check if those people on my sad suspect list...

328
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:05,544
are relevant to this case.

329
00:26:05,545 --> 00:26:07,316
I told you to stop!

330
00:26:15,025 --> 00:26:18,426
Fine. Suit yourself.

331
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:21,735
Suspect my father...

332
00:26:23,005 --> 00:26:25,166
and my brother without any proof.

333
00:26:26,775 --> 00:26:28,005
Do it all the way.

334
00:26:28,235 --> 00:26:29,305
I plan on it.

335
00:26:30,305 --> 00:26:32,075
When I take it all the way,

336
00:26:32,076 --> 00:26:33,846
I will cross paths with you at one point.

337
00:26:35,646 --> 00:26:38,086
It's obvious that you're worried about this.

338
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:56,136
"Don't suspect my father and my brother without proof"?

339
00:26:56,205 --> 00:26:57,936
Who are his father and brother?

340
00:26:58,765 --> 00:27:01,576
Do we know them? Who are they?

341
00:27:03,805 --> 00:27:05,305
Oh, my gosh.

342
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:07,475
Choi Yoon Sang.

343
00:27:07,745 --> 00:27:10,346
Choi Ju Wan. Choi Tae Guk.

344
00:27:11,485 --> 00:27:12,916
Is he Choi Tae Guk's son?

345
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:18,886
- No way. - No wonder!

346
00:27:19,225 --> 00:27:22,525
When we were talking the other day, he was a bit off.

347
00:27:23,826 --> 00:27:25,295
Right.

348
00:27:26,596 --> 00:27:30,035
That explains it. Gosh.

349
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,836
How am I going to face him now?

350
00:27:33,275 --> 00:27:35,505
Nothing's going to change. We'll treat him the same.

351
00:27:35,876 --> 00:27:38,945
But where were you last night? You didn't even answer your phone.

352
00:27:39,045 --> 00:27:41,375
I was on the phone with Professor Oh right after the explosion.

353
00:27:41,376 --> 00:27:43,045
So I went to the fishing spot.

354
00:27:44,886 --> 00:27:47,284
We met around the fishing spot, and I drove her home.

355
00:27:47,285 --> 00:27:50,785
What did she say? Why did Hong Seok Pal want to meet?

356
00:27:54,555 --> 00:27:55,926
She doesn't know that either.

357
00:27:57,465 --> 00:27:59,764
He called Professor Oh out of the blue.

358
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:02,166
And he confessed that he killed Park So Young.

359
00:28:02,396 --> 00:28:04,136
After setting up a meeting with her,

360
00:28:04,936 --> 00:28:07,076
he died in the car explosion.

361
00:28:07,636 --> 00:28:10,804
Something doesn't add up.

362
00:28:10,805 --> 00:28:12,275
Something's off.

363
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:16,285
He might not have committed suicide.

364
00:28:55,886 --> 00:28:58,225
Sir, the lawyer you talked about is here.

365
00:28:58,285 --> 00:28:59,656
And she looks really scary.

366
00:29:02,426 --> 00:29:03,765
Let's have some tea.

367
00:29:04,695 --> 00:29:07,136
So based on what you told us,

368
00:29:07,936 --> 00:29:10,235
Hong Seok Pal must have lied on the phone.

369
00:29:10,836 --> 00:29:12,435
Why would he do that?

370
00:29:12,436 --> 00:29:13,606
We should find out...

371
00:29:14,576 --> 00:29:16,075
if he was telling the truth or not.

372
00:29:16,076 --> 00:29:18,445
And if Hong Seok Pal is indeed Park So Young's killer.

373
00:29:18,705 --> 00:29:21,015
And if Professor Oh is responsible for her death.

374
00:29:21,076 --> 00:29:23,445
She must have a dashcam in her car. Right?

375
00:29:24,416 --> 00:29:26,255
This is the memory card for my dashcam.

376
00:29:26,485 --> 00:29:30,285
It has the sudden explosion and fire after my arrival.

377
00:29:30,356 --> 00:29:32,355
Someone could have installed a bomb.

378
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:33,626
A bomb?

379
00:29:33,896 --> 00:29:36,765
You might be able to find out if you tap into your network.

380
00:29:37,096 --> 00:29:40,366
Did someone install it to kill Hong Seok Pal?

381
00:29:40,666 --> 00:29:44,836
Or did Hong Seok Pal install it on his own to kill himself?

382
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,774
Gosh. But how did you find me here?

383
00:29:47,775 --> 00:29:50,005
I went off the grid, so no one could find me here.

384
00:29:51,305 --> 00:29:53,616
You talked about this place once.

385
00:29:53,715 --> 00:29:55,545
You said this was your hometown for your soul.

386
00:29:56,086 --> 00:30:00,215
Gosh. I should blame my big mouth.

387
00:30:00,515 --> 00:30:02,386
I should have called you.

388
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:08,055
But after Mr. Ha came by, I had a lot on my mind.

389
00:30:08,525 --> 00:30:11,725
Ms. Oh, now that I'm getting older,

390
00:30:11,995 --> 00:30:14,765
I easily get scared and have become a coward.

391
00:30:16,265 --> 00:30:17,406
I'm sorry.

392
00:30:21,136 --> 00:30:23,205
Are you really sorry?

393
00:30:23,376 --> 00:30:26,215
What? Yes. I'm really sorry.

394
00:30:26,346 --> 00:30:28,014
I'm very sorry.

395
00:30:28,015 --> 00:30:30,245
Then use that feeling to do a thorough job.

396
00:30:32,386 --> 00:30:35,485
Okay. I will.

397
00:30:36,156 --> 00:30:38,686
I think something bad is going to happen to me soon.

398
00:30:42,426 --> 00:30:44,166
How much progress did the police make?

399
00:30:44,566 --> 00:30:46,794
They raided Hong Seok Pal's bar and his house.

400
00:30:46,795 --> 00:30:48,836
It looks like they're considering it to be a suicide case.

401
00:30:48,896 --> 00:30:51,265
Did you hear if they found anything during the search?

402
00:30:51,505 --> 00:30:54,435
I asked a reporter. And the police put an embargo on it.

403
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:55,775
I do think there's something.

404
00:30:55,975 --> 00:30:56,975
Okay.

405
00:31:00,715 --> 00:31:03,146
There can't be anything.

406
00:31:05,485 --> 00:31:07,356
Spare me two minutes.

407
00:31:07,515 --> 00:31:09,014
I'm sorry, sir.

408
00:31:09,015 --> 00:31:11,386
It's fine. Let's continue this later.

409
00:31:17,965 --> 00:31:19,495
What's this about?

410
00:31:22,035 --> 00:31:23,636
(Hong Seok Pal died last night. Oh Soo Jae was at the scene.)

411
00:31:28,305 --> 00:31:30,475
(Hong Seok Pal died last night. Oh Soo Jae was at the scene.)

412
00:31:31,076 --> 00:31:32,406
That's why I'm here.

413
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:35,676
Something bad is going to happen to me soon.

416
00:32:03,205 --> 00:32:04,376
I'm here.

00:32:20,255 --> 00:32:21,596
Let me wrap this around you.

420
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:24,765
What's wrong?

421
00:32:26,096 --> 00:32:27,636
No, Eun Seo. It's okay.

422
00:32:27,965 --> 00:32:31,336
Anybody around? We need some help over here. Help!

423
00:32:32,975 --> 00:32:35,805
- Eun Seo, it's okay. - Are you all right, Eun Seo?

424
00:32:36,035 --> 00:32:37,305
We'll take you inside.

425
00:32:39,576 --> 00:32:41,745
It's okay. Take a deep breath.

426
00:32:51,055 --> 00:32:52,356
I forgot for a moment.

427
00:32:55,156 --> 00:32:56,626
I guess Eun Seo still needs more time.

428
00:32:57,695 --> 00:32:59,535
Let's just be thankful that she's alive.

And she started painting again.

The high-impact car accident...

431
00:33:09,505 --> 00:33:11,175
caused severe bleeding in the cerebrum.

432
00:33:11,176 --> 00:33:12,974
We've drained the haemorrhage,

433
00:33:12,975 --> 00:33:14,616
but she could experience neurological problems.

434
00:33:16,215 --> 00:33:20,686
Also, we suspect that she was sexually assaulted as well.

435
00:33:27,596 --> 00:33:28,755
I must make them pay.

436
00:33:29,525 --> 00:33:32,366
For everything they did, but one thing at a time.

437
00:33:34,735 --> 00:33:35,965
They'll get it all back.

I'll take great care of you, sir.

441
00:33:51,646 --> 00:33:56,156
You see, there are fools who think that they own what I gave them.

442
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:59,386
They don't know that it'll all be gone the moment they lose me.

443
00:34:00,025 --> 00:34:02,356
Those morons.

444
00:34:04,265 --> 00:34:06,535
They think they're important now.

445
00:34:06,896 --> 00:34:09,936
I know. This world is filled with such fools.

Hey, take a seat.

448
00:34:32,925 --> 00:34:34,756
It's very fresh today. Try it.

449
00:34:36,725 --> 00:34:38,595
It's even fresher than the last time.

450
00:34:38,725 --> 00:34:39,765
Thank you, sir.

451
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:41,795
Shall I put on some music, sir?

452
00:34:41,796 --> 00:34:45,535
No need. Today is such a happy day, even without music.

453
00:34:46,635 --> 00:34:48,175
It's a happy day for you.

454
00:34:48,975 --> 00:34:50,844
That nuisance, Hong Seok Pal, is now dead.

455
00:34:50,845 --> 00:34:52,305
I bet you're especially happy about that.

456
00:34:53,416 --> 00:34:55,475
What was the thing I had last time?

457
00:34:55,845 --> 00:34:58,845
Right. Grilled snapper head. It was really good.

I'll prepare it for you, sir.

459
00:35:04,856 --> 00:35:08,356
He died because of you.

460
00:35:11,296 --> 00:35:14,066
Because you've been running around cleaning up the mess.

461
00:35:16,236 --> 00:35:19,166
You know that he died because of you.

462

How much do you think you can protect yourself?

He is using Hong Seok Pal as bait...

465

I am the one protecting you.

466
00:35:34,356 --> 00:35:36,115
I saved you.

467
00:35:36,486 --> 00:35:38,925
Because he wants to hurt me.

468
00:35:39,225 --> 00:35:40,925
Hong Seok Pal died because of you,

469
00:35:42,396 --> 00:35:44,896
and you ordered him to kill Park So Young.

470
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:50,135
Chief Kang said the police would have to investigate you.

But technically, I was the one who founded the forum.

475
00:36:03,816 --> 00:36:08,086
It was founded two years ago. You suddenly want me to join?

476
00:36:09,725 --> 00:36:12,586
Is this what I get for demanding 70 million dollars?

477

Don't you know what kind of people are attending the forum?

to join the most powerful bunch in my inner circle.

480

Once you join them, no one can mess with you.

That includes Chief Kang, of course.

I'm suggesting this for your own sake.

What is the funnest ocean fish to catch? Do you know?

484
00:36:40,816 --> 00:36:44,825
When I was little, I went fishing with my dad often.

485
00:36:45,225 --> 00:36:47,796
In my experience, the black porgy was the best one.

486
00:36:48,155 --> 00:36:50,025
The moment you feel the bite,

487
00:36:50,026 --> 00:36:51,865
it starts pulling, and it's incredibly strong.

488
00:36:52,495 --> 00:36:55,166
It's so strong that even your fishing rod gets dragged away.

489
00:36:56,736 --> 00:36:59,365
I lost my fishing rod in a flash, so I was upset about it.

490
00:37:00,175 --> 00:37:01,876
But that moment, the boat captain said this.

491
00:37:03,075 --> 00:37:04,446
"The one who throws bait..."

492
00:37:05,405 --> 00:37:07,745
"doesn't necessarily have the upper hand."

493
00:37:09,376 --> 00:37:11,745
"It even took your fishing rod away from you,"

494
00:37:14,155 --> 00:37:16,114
"so it beat you."

495
00:37:16,115 --> 00:37:19,925
The fish beat you because it took the bait and the fishing rod too?

496
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:26,635
That is not true, Soo Jae. How long do you think the fish held out?

497
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:29,765
A day at the most.

498
00:37:31,265 --> 00:37:33,174
When you think you've bitten the bait,

499
00:37:33,175 --> 00:37:35,376
you should let the fisherman reel you in, so you won't be hurt.

500
00:37:36,575 --> 00:37:38,605
If you try to wriggle your way out,

501
00:37:38,606 --> 00:37:42,216
the hook will rip your mouth, and you'll be hurt.

502
00:37:45,716 --> 00:37:47,055
Make sure you attend the event.

503
00:37:47,716 --> 00:37:49,555
It'll lead you to better things.

504
00:37:52,526 --> 00:37:53,955
I politely decline.

505
00:37:57,296 --> 00:37:58,725
You see, that bait...

506
00:37:59,765 --> 00:38:01,265
I won't bite it.

507
00:38:46,106 --> 00:38:47,975
(Gong Chan)

508
00:38:51,745 --> 00:38:52,816
Hey.

509
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:54,916
Check out the waxing gibbous moon.

510
00:38:56,356 --> 00:38:57,385
What?

511
00:38:58,155 --> 00:39:00,155
And next to it, I see Jupiter too.

512
00:39:00,526 --> 00:39:01,655
Jupiter?

513
00:39:11,035 --> 00:39:13,106
Where is Jupiter?

514
00:39:13,705 --> 00:39:15,606
The small sparkling star next to the moon.

515
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,506
That's Jupiter. You didn't know?

516
00:39:19,075 --> 00:39:20,475
How ignorant.

517
00:39:21,245 --> 00:39:23,515
I've never been called ignorant before.

518
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:28,086
Anyway, where are you now?

519
00:39:28,385 --> 00:39:30,225
I'm delivering something while admiring Jupiter.

520
00:39:31,225 --> 00:39:32,256
Delivering what?

521
00:39:33,425 --> 00:39:35,256
A healthy dinner.

522
00:39:38,466 --> 00:39:39,865
I left it in front of your door.

523
00:39:41,666 --> 00:39:43,864
You're here now? Are you in the lobby?

524
00:39:43,865 --> 00:39:46,305
I wanted to see you and give it to you in person,

525
00:39:46,836 --> 00:39:50,075
but you should go to bed, so I'm just leaving.

526
00:39:51,075 --> 00:39:52,146
Bye.

527
00:40:24,546 --> 00:40:25,606
(Gong Chan)

528
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,816
Make sure you eat all of it before you wash up.

529
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,686
Don't worry about anything. Just sleep well.

530
00:40:34,256 --> 00:40:36,486
See you tomorrow at school, with smiles on our faces.

531
00:40:58,546 --> 00:40:59,945
The detectives are here.

532
00:40:59,946 --> 00:41:02,075
They came here because they couldn't reach you.

533
00:41:05,416 --> 00:41:09,384
I get that you couldn't reach her, but you can't just barge in here.

534
00:41:09,385 --> 00:41:11,324
You know that you're overreacting, right?

535
00:41:11,325 --> 00:41:14,595
Gosh, seriously. It's not like I wanted to come here.

536
00:41:14,955 --> 00:41:16,555
Are you here to see me?

537
00:41:19,466 --> 00:41:21,435
Detective Do Jin Myung, Jungang Police Station.

538
00:41:21,436 --> 00:41:23,665
Why didn't you answer your phone?

539
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:26,606
We came all the way here because you didn't pick up.

540
00:41:27,305 --> 00:41:29,436
You'll have to come with us for a witness interview.

541
00:41:30,345 --> 00:41:33,146
You're probably here because of Hong Seok Pal's death.

542
00:41:33,376 --> 00:41:35,975
If you're suspecting me because I was at the scene, I can explain it.

543
00:41:36,515 --> 00:41:39,815
He wanted to meet, so I went there. But his car suddenly exploded,

544
00:41:39,816 --> 00:41:42,686
so I called 911 and left.

545
00:41:47,555 --> 00:41:49,325
I'm sure you already checked his call log...

546
00:41:49,626 --> 00:41:52,566
as well as the recording of the call between me and 911.

547
00:41:52,765 --> 00:41:56,595
Yet you came here in such a rush just to interview a witness?

548
00:41:57,736 --> 00:41:59,364
It's a little over the top, don't you think?

549
00:41:59,365 --> 00:42:02,005
Like you said, you spoke with him just before he died.

550
00:42:02,006 --> 00:42:04,975
You were at the scene, and you called 911.

551
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:08,345
We found Hong Seok Pal's phone in his office.

552
00:42:09,146 --> 00:42:13,416
We found a recording of the last phone call he made.

553
00:42:13,586 --> 00:42:16,416
Park So Young. What if I killed her?

554
00:42:16,925 --> 00:42:19,154
- What? - Why? Did what I just said...

555
00:42:19,155 --> 00:42:20,555
get your attention now?

556
00:42:20,756 --> 00:42:23,625
I get it. You're partially responsible...

557
00:42:23,626 --> 00:42:25,126
for the way she died.

558
00:42:25,365 --> 00:42:28,166
You clearly had something to do with Hong Seok Pal's death...

559
00:42:28,236 --> 00:42:31,506
and Park So Young's death too. We have many questions for you,

560
00:42:32,506 --> 00:42:34,074
so you'll have to come with us.

561
00:42:34,075 --> 00:42:35,836
You're asking her to go to the station with you?

562
00:42:36,776 --> 00:42:40,216
You don't have an arrest warrant. She's a witness, not a suspect.

563
00:42:40,316 --> 00:42:42,514
You can't take her to the station without her permission.

564
00:42:42,515 --> 00:42:43,515
Kid.

565
00:42:44,046 --> 00:42:46,344
We'll decide if she's a witness or a suspect.

566
00:42:46,345 --> 00:42:48,485
Hold on. A suspect?

567
00:42:48,486 --> 00:42:50,526
Did you just call our professor a suspect?

568
00:42:51,256 --> 00:42:53,796
Will you take responsibility for what you just said?

569
00:42:54,495 --> 00:42:56,455
I'm going to start recording now. Okay?

570
00:42:56,626 --> 00:42:58,594
Right. We're going to film you now.

571
00:42:58,595 --> 00:43:00,025
You'd better take responsibility for this later.

572
00:43:00,026 --> 00:43:01,236
Calm down.

573
00:43:01,936 --> 00:43:03,705
Hong Seok Pal died because of you.

574
00:43:03,966 --> 00:43:06,876
Chief Kang said the police would have to investigate you.

575
00:43:07,276 --> 00:43:08,336
So...

576
00:43:09,535 --> 00:43:12,305
did your chief order you to bring me in?

577
00:43:19,946 --> 00:43:21,015
Yes, chief.

578
00:43:23,526 --> 00:43:25,455
Yes. Okay.

579
00:43:29,155 --> 00:43:32,526
Ms. Oh, you're under arrest.

580
00:43:33,026 --> 00:43:35,094
What? You have no grounds to arrest her.

581
00:43:35,095 --> 00:43:37,465
She's a law professor. Why are you arresting her?

582
00:43:37,466 --> 00:43:38,935
This is an abuse of authority.

583
00:43:38,936 --> 00:43:40,534
Article 213 of the Criminal Code.

584
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,134
Abuse of authority and hindrance to the exercise of rights.

585
00:43:42,135 --> 00:43:44,375
Article 214. Abuse of authority and unlawful arrest!

586
00:43:44,376 --> 00:43:46,344
Ms. Oh, you're under arrest...

587
00:43:46,345 --> 00:43:47,815
for instigating to murder Park So Young...

588
00:43:47,816 --> 00:43:50,585
and aiding and abetting Hong Seok Pal's suicide. Understood?

589
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,215
What nonsense is that?

590
00:43:52,216 --> 00:43:54,014
Detective Do, what is this?

591
00:43:54,015 --> 00:43:57,025
You have the right to an attorney. You have the right to remain silent.

592
00:43:57,026 --> 00:44:01,155
Anything you say can be used against you in court.

593
00:44:01,296 --> 00:44:03,055
I'm sure you all know that.

594
00:44:07,566 --> 00:44:08,566
Professor Oh.

595
00:44:12,006 --> 00:44:14,034
When you think you've bitten the bait,

596
00:44:14,035 --> 00:44:16,336
you should let the fisherman reel you in, so you won't be hurt.

597
00:44:16,606 --> 00:44:18,145
If you try to wriggle your way out,

598
00:44:18,146 --> 00:44:21,345
the hook will rip your mouth, and you'll be hurt.

599
00:44:22,146 --> 00:44:24,115
He was more impatient than I thought.

600
00:44:26,146 --> 00:44:27,216
Right?

601
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,026
So you're arresting me without a warrant.

602
00:44:31,356 --> 00:44:33,025
You're sure you'll meet the conditions...

603
00:44:33,026 --> 00:44:34,325
to grant you a lawful arrest?

604
00:44:34,555 --> 00:44:37,395
You must think that we don't follow any protocol.

605
00:44:37,396 --> 00:44:39,094
We have probable cause...

606
00:44:39,095 --> 00:44:41,095
A warrantless arrest.

607
00:44:42,095 --> 00:44:43,565
There's a risk of getting evaluated...

608
00:44:43,566 --> 00:44:45,506
if your arrest was lawful or not afterwards.

609
00:44:46,336 --> 00:44:48,305
So you will face the consequences, right?

610
00:44:48,675 --> 00:44:49,836
With your job on the line.

611
00:44:50,075 --> 00:44:54,115
My gosh. Arresting a lawyer is such a hassle.

612
00:44:54,876 --> 00:44:56,916
Why don't we go quietly?

613
00:44:57,285 --> 00:44:59,085
- Detective Shin. Detective Do! - You can't... Professor Oh!

614
00:44:59,086 --> 00:45:01,086
- Hold on. - Song Mi Rim.

615
00:45:03,856 --> 00:45:05,256
I want you to represent me.

616
00:45:05,486 --> 00:45:09,225
Yes. I'll do it. I'll be your lawyer.

617
00:45:09,555 --> 00:45:10,765
I don't want...

618
00:45:12,365 --> 00:45:13,936
any of you to leave school.

619
00:45:16,495 --> 00:45:18,006
At least remove the handcuffs.

620
00:45:18,905 --> 00:45:21,475
It's not like she's going to flee. And this is our school.

621
00:45:22,535 --> 00:45:24,146
At least show her some respect.

622
00:45:25,106 --> 00:45:26,175
Let's go.

623
00:45:26,606 --> 00:45:27,646
Wait.

624
00:45:33,955 --> 00:45:35,454
Do you have a warrant?

625
00:45:35,455 --> 00:45:37,126
Are you sure it meets the conditions for a warrantless arrest?

626
00:45:37,756 --> 00:45:39,486
How could you put handcuffs on her at school?

627
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:43,425
- Have you lost your mind? - Let's go.

628
00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:45,296
Wait.

629
00:46:19,495 --> 00:46:22,666
Water my plant.

630
00:46:26,865 --> 00:46:28,236
Move out of the way. Let's go.

631
00:46:48,026 --> 00:46:51,995
(Jungang Police Station)

632
00:47:09,046 --> 00:47:10,514
- Do you admit instigating murder? - Do you admit...

633
00:47:10,515 --> 00:47:11,985
aiding and abetting Hong Seok Pal's suicide?

634
00:47:11,986 --> 00:47:13,114
Why did you have her killed?

635
00:47:13,115 --> 00:47:15,615
Is it true you told Hong Seok Pal to kill Park So Young?

636
00:47:15,686 --> 00:47:19,225
You showed no sense of remorse when Park So Young died.

637
00:47:19,555 --> 00:47:20,696
How do you feel now?

638
00:47:20,896 --> 00:47:22,825
You still feel no remorse?

639
00:47:26,126 --> 00:47:27,166
Not at all.

640
00:47:27,765 --> 00:47:29,995
- What? - Step out of the way.

641
00:47:30,336 --> 00:47:31,506
Next news.

642
00:47:31,635 --> 00:47:33,435
Lawyer Oh Soo Jae of TK Law Firm...

643
00:47:33,436 --> 00:47:36,174
was in the limelight when Park So Young died.

644
00:47:36,175 --> 00:47:39,204
And she was arrested for instigating to murder Park So Young...

645
00:47:39,205 --> 00:47:41,145
and aiding and abetting Hong Seok Pal's suicide...

646
00:47:41,146 --> 00:47:42,674
without a warrant.

647
00:47:42,675 --> 00:47:45,415
- What? What nonsense is that? - Lawyer Oh Soo Jae...

648
00:47:45,416 --> 00:47:48,916
was considered to be a managing partner at TK Law Firm.

649
00:47:49,055 --> 00:47:51,085
She was a star lawyer at TK Law Firm.

650
00:47:51,086 --> 00:47:53,485
- What is this? - It's been disclosed that...

651
00:47:53,486 --> 00:47:55,924
she had instigated Hong Seok Pal to murder Park So Young...

652
00:47:55,925 --> 00:47:58,065
by pushing her off the TK building.

653
00:47:58,066 --> 00:47:59,566
And this discovery sent shock waves to the public.

654
00:48:11,345 --> 00:48:12,405
Father.

655
00:48:13,205 --> 00:48:14,675
You knew about this, right?

656
00:48:15,416 --> 00:48:17,816
You knew about Soo Jae's arrest, right?

657
00:48:19,316 --> 00:48:20,916
Get her out right now.

658
00:48:21,555 --> 00:48:23,356
Tell them to release her now!

659
00:48:35,936 --> 00:48:37,035
Why did you do it?

660
00:48:38,106 --> 00:48:40,805
- I was bored. - What did she tell you to find?

661
00:48:40,936 --> 00:48:42,776
You must have hidden something there.

662
00:48:43,876 --> 00:48:45,276
Behind that weird button.

663
00:48:55,785 --> 00:48:58,385
Nice. Getting paper-slapped made me come to my senses.

664
00:48:59,026 --> 00:49:00,955
Stop beating people up.

665
00:49:01,925 --> 00:49:03,695
What if you end up killing them?

666
00:49:03,696 --> 00:49:05,725
You're lucky that you're my son.

667
00:49:05,966 --> 00:49:07,166
If you weren't,

668
00:49:07,865 --> 00:49:09,494
you wouldn't be standing here.

669
00:49:09,495 --> 00:49:12,205
Father. There had never been a moment...

670
00:49:12,336 --> 00:49:15,475
I felt lucky that you were my father in my entire life!

671
00:49:17,345 --> 00:49:18,745
Father, why is Soo Jae...

672
00:49:22,776 --> 00:49:24,345
But there must have been a moment...

673
00:49:25,446 --> 00:49:27,356
when you felt lucky to be his son.

674
00:49:27,885 --> 00:49:29,416
When I was a high school senior,

675
00:49:30,155 --> 00:49:32,955
Mom collapsed because of that big mess you made!

676
00:49:34,225 --> 00:49:36,655
I remember how Father cleaned up all that mess for you.

677
00:49:38,365 --> 00:49:39,724
What are you talking about?

678
00:49:39,725 --> 00:49:41,966
Mom passed away five days after her collapse.

679
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:45,265
So I wasn't even interested in the mess you created.

680
00:49:46,836 --> 00:49:49,404
Did you feel lucky to be his son?

681
00:49:49,405 --> 00:49:50,775
- You jerk. - Choi Yoon Sang!

682
00:49:50,776 --> 00:49:53,146
Yes! I'm leaving.

683
00:49:53,805 --> 00:49:55,776
I'll go and get her out no matter what.

684
00:49:57,316 --> 00:49:59,546
You're only allowed to do two things when you leave this office.

685
00:50:03,716 --> 00:50:06,285
Stay out of Soo Jae's case completely.

686
00:50:07,595 --> 00:50:08,896
And come back home.

687
00:50:18,836 --> 00:50:20,134
They are worried that...

688
00:50:20,135 --> 00:50:22,276
the sell-off might not go through because of Soo Jae.

689
00:50:22,506 --> 00:50:24,204
Chief Legal Officer Han has been calling me too.

690
00:50:24,205 --> 00:50:25,245
You.

691
00:50:26,146 --> 00:50:28,416
Don't miss this chance in her absence.

692
00:50:29,646 --> 00:50:31,285
Take back what's ours.

693
00:50:31,385 --> 00:50:32,615
Father, is that why...

694
00:50:34,256 --> 00:50:37,825
Is that why you didn't stop them from arresting Soo Jae?

695
00:51:12,385 --> 00:51:13,626
You're not going to question her?

696
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:17,126
The chief wanted to question her, so he told us to wait.

697
00:51:17,495 --> 00:51:20,126
Is she that important? Even the chief is coming down?

698
00:51:23,736 --> 00:51:26,705
Gosh. Did she hear us or what? Why is she smiling at us?

699
00:51:27,436 --> 00:51:30,336
Seriously. Is she really crazy or something?

700
00:51:36,916 --> 00:51:40,655
Gosh. The passcode. I should have asked her that.

701
00:51:40,916 --> 00:51:43,256
- What do we do? - Should we ask her friend?

702
00:51:43,756 --> 00:51:45,955
- Dr. Chae Jun Hee. - Right.

703
00:51:50,865 --> 00:51:53,925
Ms. Song, I wanted to call you. Soo Jae is not answering her phone.

704
00:51:54,365 --> 00:51:56,835
Jun Hee, I'm in a hurry.

705
00:51:56,836 --> 00:51:59,205
Do you know Ms. Oh's passcode to her house?

706
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:02,635
I see.

707
00:52:19,756 --> 00:52:21,825
Why would she pick such an easy passcode?

708
00:52:24,696 --> 00:52:25,765
Chan.

709
00:52:31,066 --> 00:52:32,404
My housekeeper put it there,

710
00:52:32,405 --> 00:52:33,865
but I don't have a green thumb.

711
00:52:38,776 --> 00:52:40,074
The house is under the company's name.

712
00:52:40,075 --> 00:52:41,146
And I'm the one who gave her the keys.

713
00:52:48,515 --> 00:52:50,985
Ms. Song. Where are you?

714
00:52:50,986 --> 00:52:53,486
Jun Hee, I'm right here.

715
00:52:54,626 --> 00:52:56,424
- Is she okay? - Yes, she's okay.

716
00:52:56,425 --> 00:52:57,796
My goodness.

717
00:52:58,865 --> 00:53:00,126
Mr. Choi?

718
00:53:05,205 --> 00:53:07,235
People said TK Law Firm was an incredible law firm...

719
00:53:07,236 --> 00:53:08,836
where everyone dreamed of working.

720
00:53:09,175 --> 00:53:10,506
So I had high hopes.

721
00:53:10,805 --> 00:53:12,046
And it makes me concerned...

722
00:53:12,405 --> 00:53:14,215
about my professor's mental well-being...

723
00:53:14,216 --> 00:53:15,416
for having to put up with a jerk like you.

724
00:53:15,615 --> 00:53:16,915
A jerk like me?

725
00:53:16,916 --> 00:53:19,216
Yes. You heard me.

726
00:53:20,686 --> 00:53:23,515
Come to think of it, this doesn't make sense.

727
00:53:24,455 --> 00:53:26,724
You could have gotten Ms. Song to do it. But you came here...

728
00:53:26,725 --> 00:53:28,495
with a locksmith.

729
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:30,765
- Really? - Yes.

730
00:53:31,066 --> 00:53:33,325
People might think that you're here to steal things.

731
00:53:34,436 --> 00:53:36,836
Do I need to explain my actions to you?

732
00:53:37,436 --> 00:53:39,134
And didn't you know...

733
00:53:39,135 --> 00:53:41,534
that the company provided housing for her?

734
00:53:41,535 --> 00:53:44,245
Does it mean you can just pick the lock and barge in here?

735
00:53:44,345 --> 00:53:46,646
I guess that's normal for TK Law Firm.

736
00:53:46,705 --> 00:53:48,344
Since you're providing housing for her,

737
00:53:48,345 --> 00:53:50,416
you can come in here whenever you want? Is that it?

738
00:53:53,416 --> 00:53:54,916
Where is her room?

739
00:53:59,626 --> 00:54:01,454
Can you go and watch him?

740
00:54:01,455 --> 00:54:03,155
- Okay. - Okay.

741
00:54:23,916 --> 00:54:25,916
Did you find it? Are you leaving now?

742
00:54:42,466 --> 00:54:43,595
Ms. Oh.

743
00:54:43,666 --> 00:54:46,566
I refuse to answer any questions until my lawyer gets here.

744
00:54:46,705 --> 00:54:50,236
When will your lawyer get here?

745
00:54:54,475 --> 00:54:55,745
Sorry.

746
00:54:57,015 --> 00:54:58,416
Sorry.

747
00:54:59,446 --> 00:55:01,055
I had to water the plant.

748
00:55:04,325 --> 00:55:05,586
Let's begin.

749
00:55:10,626 --> 00:55:11,666
I...

750
00:55:13,066 --> 00:55:16,035
killed Park So Young...

751
00:55:17,035 --> 00:55:18,836
for Oh Soo Jae from TK Law Firm.

752
00:55:20,305 --> 00:55:22,375
The person who pushed Park So Young...

753
00:55:22,376 --> 00:55:23,836
off the rooftop of the TK building...

754
00:55:24,575 --> 00:55:25,675
was me.

755
00:55:27,506 --> 00:55:28,845
Hong Seok Pal.

756
00:55:36,555 --> 00:55:37,586
Hey.

757
00:55:38,356 --> 00:55:42,196
Who do you think you are? You think you can boss me around?

758
00:55:42,626 --> 00:55:45,364
Park So Young won't get away with this.

759
00:55:45,365 --> 00:55:47,095
Do you really want to end up in prison?

760
00:55:48,966 --> 00:55:51,335
You have several hostess bars in Gangnam.

761
00:55:51,336 --> 00:55:53,566
I can make sure all of them go under.

762
00:55:54,405 --> 00:55:55,775
Do your kids know...

763
00:55:55,776 --> 00:55:59,304
how their father is coming up with their tuition abroad?

764
00:55:59,305 --> 00:56:02,675
Hey, you'd better leave my kids out of this.

765
00:56:04,046 --> 00:56:05,946
If you get my kids involved in this,

766
00:56:07,015 --> 00:56:10,385
I'm going to kill you! Got that?

767
00:56:10,615 --> 00:56:12,586
So think carefully about...

768
00:56:12,825 --> 00:56:15,296
how you're going to get rid of Park So Young.

769
00:56:15,396 --> 00:56:17,195
Get rid of her?

770
00:56:17,196 --> 00:56:19,595
Why would I do that?

771
00:56:20,526 --> 00:56:22,896
Do what you guys are good at.

772
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:26,265
You can bury people without leaving a trace.

773
00:56:27,106 --> 00:56:30,236
Oh Soo Jae blackmailed me...

774
00:56:31,175 --> 00:56:33,106
because of Assemblyman An Kang Won.

775
00:56:33,946 --> 00:56:35,975
She was seeing him.

776
00:56:36,446 --> 00:56:38,316
But he was also involved with Park So Young.

777
00:56:39,845 --> 00:56:42,615
And this scandal made Oh Soo Jae livid.

778
00:56:43,256 --> 00:56:46,555
So she told me to kill Park So Young.

779
00:56:46,955 --> 00:56:49,196
She said if I didn't kill her,

780
00:56:50,225 --> 00:56:52,896
she would make sure all of my businesses go under,

781
00:56:53,166 --> 00:56:54,365
and she would torture...

782
00:56:55,696 --> 00:56:57,666
my kids.

783
00:56:59,836 --> 00:57:02,475
Do you admit that you ordered Hong Seok Pal to kill Park So Young?

784
00:57:05,606 --> 00:57:06,705
Ms. Oh.

785
00:57:08,115 --> 00:57:09,916
Let's finish the video.

786
00:57:14,515 --> 00:57:17,216
That's how Oh Soo Jae blackmailed me.

787
00:57:17,955 --> 00:57:19,356
So I had no choice...

788
00:57:20,586 --> 00:57:22,225
but to kill Park So Young.

789
00:57:25,166 --> 00:57:28,166
(Detective Cho: I got Hong Seok Pal's confession video.)

790
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:31,305
I had nightmares every night.

791
00:57:32,006 --> 00:57:34,675
And I felt so guilty that I couldn't go on with my life.

792
00:57:34,936 --> 00:57:37,205
So Young. I'm really sorry.

793
00:57:37,506 --> 00:57:40,074
And I would like to offer my sincere apology...

794
00:57:40,075 --> 00:57:41,975
to the bereaved family.

795
00:57:42,975 --> 00:57:44,115
I'm sorry.

796
00:57:45,646 --> 00:57:47,515
I'm really sorry.

797
00:57:50,385 --> 00:57:51,526
Darn it.

798
00:57:53,526 --> 00:57:54,925
I will meet with Oh Soo Jae...

799
00:57:56,325 --> 00:57:57,796
one last time.

800
00:57:58,466 --> 00:57:59,995
And I will commit...

801
00:58:01,095 --> 00:58:02,265
suicide...

802
00:58:03,466 --> 00:58:04,765
in front of her.

803
00:58:14,345 --> 00:58:17,075
We got it. It's over.

804
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:35,166
That lowlife, Hong Seok Pal, came here...

805
00:58:35,365 --> 00:58:37,296
and talked about Park So Young?

806
00:58:37,936 --> 00:58:39,566
Get him in here right now.

807
00:58:39,966 --> 00:58:43,405
We have cleaners who take care of dirt bags like him.

808
00:58:43,475 --> 00:58:46,675
Right. Oh Soo Jae can deal with him.

809
00:58:46,805 --> 00:58:48,945
Tell her to crush him.

810
00:58:48,946 --> 00:58:50,316
She will destroy him,

811
00:58:51,316 --> 00:58:52,946
and we should get rid of the cleaner too.

812
00:58:53,046 --> 00:58:55,985
Why? The sell-off hasn't been finalized yet.

813
00:58:55,986 --> 00:58:58,955
Besides, she's nothing like that lowlife, Hong Seok Pal.

814
00:58:59,425 --> 00:59:00,955
Whenever I stand here,

815
00:59:01,425 --> 00:59:03,525
I always think...

816
00:59:03,526 --> 00:59:05,396
Chairman Choi couldn't have picked a better seat.

817
00:59:05,925 --> 00:59:06,995
But...

818
00:59:07,325 --> 00:59:10,736
Oh Soo Jae has the files on the cruise.

819
00:59:12,535 --> 00:59:13,965
So I don't know...

820
00:59:13,966 --> 00:59:16,475
if we have a bright future ahead of us or a bleak one.

821
00:59:21,515 --> 00:59:24,015
We must unite when there's work to get done.

822
00:59:24,816 --> 00:59:27,315
That way, I can appoint you to be the Minister of Justice...

823
00:59:27,316 --> 00:59:29,686
when my administration takes over.

824
00:59:32,425 --> 00:59:35,325
Your desire to make me the President.

825
00:59:36,655 --> 00:59:39,295
And your desire to be my stepping stone.

826
00:59:39,296 --> 00:59:41,566
That hasn't changed, right?

827
00:59:45,365 --> 00:59:46,804
Hold on.

828
00:59:46,805 --> 00:59:50,236
Why is this talk getting so serious?

829
00:59:52,446 --> 00:59:53,574
Of course, not.

830
00:59:53,575 --> 00:59:55,975
You meant it when you said...

831
00:59:56,876 --> 00:59:59,015
you would do anything...

832
00:59:59,646 --> 01:00:01,655
to make me the President, right?

833
01:00:01,986 --> 01:00:04,885
Of course. When have I not been honest with you?

834
01:00:05,955 --> 01:00:08,125
Gosh. People might think...

835
01:00:08,126 --> 01:00:10,955
you're professing love to each other.

836
01:00:12,466 --> 01:00:13,696
Goodness.

837
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:17,696
This feels weird.

838
01:00:24,575 --> 01:00:26,575
All this for a mere position?

839
01:00:30,146 --> 01:00:33,216
That fool. He thinks I'm his stepping stone?

840
01:00:34,146 --> 01:00:36,555
He doesn't even know what his role is.

841
01:00:41,155 --> 01:00:42,724
(Autopsy Report, Hong Seok Pal)

842
01:00:42,725 --> 01:00:44,025
(The deceased died in a car explosion.)

843
01:00:44,026 --> 01:00:45,824
I don't see any signs of foul play.

844
01:00:45,825 --> 01:00:47,666
I think he was addicted to drugs.

845
01:00:47,995 --> 01:00:50,635
But it doesn't have a direct tie to his death.

846
01:00:50,836 --> 01:00:53,134
The causes of death were asphyxiation from carbon monoxide...

847
01:00:53,135 --> 01:00:54,635
and burning.

848
01:00:55,035 --> 01:00:57,436
My opinion is that he committed suicide.

849
01:01:20,296 --> 01:01:22,035
(Establish law and order)

850
01:01:22,166 --> 01:01:26,966
(Corrections)

851
01:01:32,546 --> 01:01:36,716
(Establish law and order)

852
01:02:11,316 --> 01:02:14,146
(Live to repent)

853
01:02:45,716 --> 01:02:48,655
(Why Her?)

854
01:03:09,305 --> 01:03:11,445
- What a mess. - Those darn reporters.

855
01:03:11,446 --> 01:03:12,474
This is just the beginning.

856
01:03:12,475 --> 01:03:14,974
Harsher words will become the truth, and they'll think she's the culprit.

857
01:03:14,975 --> 01:03:18,614
The police began searching Oh Soo Jae's office and house.

858
01:03:18,615 --> 01:03:20,145
- It's gone. - Yes.

859
01:03:20,146 --> 01:03:22,915
TK Law Firm has nothing to do with the case in question.

860
01:03:22,916 --> 01:03:24,985
We must find evidence that Professor Oh is innocent.

861
01:03:24,986 --> 01:03:26,355
You jerks!

862
01:03:26,356 --> 01:03:27,985
Why are you doing this so fast?

863
01:03:27,986 --> 01:03:29,355
You don't know if this is real or fake.

864
01:03:29,356 --> 01:03:30,525
This could be real.

865
01:03:30,526 --> 01:03:32,065
She wouldn't say stuff like that.

866
01:03:32,066 --> 01:03:34,895
I'm sure she's a few moves ahead even in prison.

867
01:03:34,896 --> 01:03:37,764
Someone who can bring in Hong Seok Pal to get me involved.

868
01:03:37,765 --> 01:03:39,506
What would you do if you were in my shoes?

869
01:03:39,905 --> 01:03:41,066
I would detain her.
