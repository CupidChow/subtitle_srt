(This is a work of fiction. All characters, places, incidents,)

3
00:00:14,374 --> 00:00:16,743
(Episode 4)

4
00:00:18,774 --> 00:00:20,044
It must be Professor Oh.

5
00:00:20,143 --> 00:00:22,884
Professor Oh told the police. I'm sure of it.

6
00:00:23,184 --> 00:00:26,083
For real? Are you sure? Professor Oh?

7
00:00:26,414 --> 00:00:27,954
Yes, 100 percent.

8
00:00:28,384 --> 00:00:31,594
Do you think so too? It may not be the case.

9
00:00:32,423 --> 00:00:35,293
I asked a friend of mine when I heard Park Ji Young got arrested.

10
00:00:35,294 --> 00:00:36,964
Apparently, the police received a sudden tip-off.

11
00:00:43,504 --> 00:00:45,974
And it's all stuff we talked about.

12
00:00:46,074 --> 00:00:47,604
So it has to be her.

13
00:00:47,703 --> 00:00:50,273
Hey, what are you thinking about?

14
00:00:50,504 --> 00:00:51,574
What?

15
00:00:53,144 --> 00:00:56,184
Professor Oh, seriously? This is wrong, don't you think?

16
00:01:31,913 --> 00:01:33,583
About Park Ji Young.

17
00:01:34,154 --> 00:01:37,284
Why don't you take on her case as the Legal Clinic's first case?

18
00:01:37,553 --> 00:01:40,293
Based on what I saw, I believe she needs help.

19
00:01:40,693 --> 00:01:42,723
She came here to see you and posted that video.

20
00:01:42,724 --> 00:01:44,124
I'm sure she did it for a reason.

21
00:01:44,594 --> 00:01:47,534
There are things you just know when you get to my age.

22
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:49,663
She did not kill her sister.

23
00:01:50,963 --> 00:01:52,803
Then who do you think killed her?

24
00:01:55,103 --> 00:01:56,644
You see,

25
00:01:57,543 --> 00:01:59,644
what I'm more curious about is...

26
00:02:00,674 --> 00:02:02,713
why she died there.

27
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:06,154
I mean, why there...

28
00:02:06,383 --> 00:02:07,383
of all places?

29
00:02:25,804 --> 00:02:27,673
This man owns the hostess bar where Park So Young worked.

30
00:02:27,874 --> 00:02:29,143
His name is Hong Seok Pal.

31
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:33,814
He was notorious for his ruthless ways in the demolition industry.

32
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:36,942
Then he met Chairman Han and started working for Hansu Construction,

33
00:02:36,943 --> 00:02:38,684
and the hostess bar became a huge success too.

34
00:02:38,953 --> 00:02:40,113
He's known as...

35
00:02:40,154 --> 00:02:42,524
Chairman Han's henchman who does all his dirty work.

36
00:02:43,554 --> 00:02:47,494
On the top floor of the building, there's a room for VIPs.

37
00:02:47,923 --> 00:02:49,893
Do you know who the A-list VIPs are?

38
00:02:50,763 --> 00:02:53,064
- Hello, sir. - Mr. Hong.

39
00:02:53,263 --> 00:02:55,132
- Chairman Han Sung Bum. - You look great.

40
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,834
- Assemblyman Lee. - Hello, sir.

41
00:02:56,964 --> 00:02:58,274
Assemblyman Lee In Soo.

42
00:02:58,974 --> 00:03:00,004
And...

43
00:03:01,073 --> 00:03:02,203
Don't be surprised.

44
00:03:04,913 --> 00:03:06,073
Chairman Choi.

45
00:03:07,013 --> 00:03:10,314
Gosh, all men are the same.

46
00:03:11,254 --> 00:03:12,853
(Mr. Ko, Incoming Call)

47
00:03:16,584 --> 00:03:17,624
Yes.

48
00:03:17,953 --> 00:03:20,624
Ms. Oh, I found out something. I'll head over there now.

49
00:03:21,224 --> 00:03:22,792
(Reproductive Endocrinology Clinic)

50
00:03:22,793 --> 00:03:26,094
What was Park So Young doing at an ob-gyn clinic?

51
00:03:26,763 --> 00:03:28,663
I went through hoops to get my hands on this.

52
00:03:32,804 --> 00:03:34,702
(Park So Young, 4 weeks pregnant)

53
00:03:34,703 --> 00:03:35,904
She was pregnant?

54
00:03:36,404 --> 00:03:38,143
Ms. Oh, did you know about this?

55
00:03:38,814 --> 00:03:40,714
I suspected it.

56
00:03:40,774 --> 00:03:42,983
But the autopsy report said nothing about that.

57
00:03:43,344 --> 00:03:44,883
The medical examiner who conducted it...

58
00:03:45,613 --> 00:03:48,684
The director got mad at me for doing something I wasn't told to do...

59
00:03:48,923 --> 00:03:50,724
and ordered me to just hand it over.

60
00:03:51,594 --> 00:03:55,123
His boss told him not to complicate things...

61
00:03:55,124 --> 00:03:56,763
because it'd be concluded as suicide anyway.

62
00:03:57,263 --> 00:03:59,733
He said he was only following orders.

63
00:04:00,793 --> 00:04:02,404
That's nuts. How could he...

64
00:04:07,603 --> 00:04:09,904
But she died like that.

65
00:04:11,004 --> 00:04:12,714
Even though she knew there was a baby in her womb.

66
00:04:14,513 --> 00:04:15,844
She was a mother-to-be.

67
00:04:18,314 --> 00:04:19,453
A mother...

68
00:04:24,454 --> 00:04:26,993
And here, Ms. Oh.

69
00:04:28,464 --> 00:04:33,062
My boys pulled a few all-nighters and finally got it open...

70
00:04:33,063 --> 00:04:34,763
only to find out...

71
00:04:34,764 --> 00:04:37,034
that every file is double, triple-protected with passwords.

72
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,634
What is this?

73
00:04:38,873 --> 00:04:40,733
We found it amongst Hansu Bio's documents.

74
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:44,503
Fingerprint identification and every file is password-protected?

75
00:04:45,514 --> 00:04:47,543
There's something fishy going on.

76
00:04:49,113 --> 00:04:51,482
We managed to open one of the files,

77
00:04:51,483 --> 00:04:53,784
and it's surely interesting, to say the least.

78
00:05:02,264 --> 00:05:05,194
With our best wishes for the success of Yeongpyeong District,

79
00:05:05,534 --> 00:05:07,293
we will now kick off the construction.

80
00:05:07,464 --> 00:05:08,503
One.

81
00:05:10,334 --> 00:05:11,433
Two.

82
00:05:13,173 --> 00:05:14,204
Three!

(Yeongpyeong District Public Information Center)

85
00:05:23,284 --> 00:05:24,413
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

86
00:05:25,913 --> 00:05:29,324
My gosh. I know you were under a lot of stress for the past few years,

87
00:05:29,884 --> 00:05:31,824
but you did it at last.

88
00:05:31,923 --> 00:05:34,324
I would not have been able to make this happen on my own.

89
00:05:34,724 --> 00:05:36,694
It's all thanks to your hard work, Assemblyman Lee.

90
00:05:37,724 --> 00:05:41,194
You too, Chairman Choi. You helped me out so much.

91
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,663
We made this happen together.

92
00:05:44,603 --> 00:05:46,273
Chairman Choi, I think...

93
00:05:46,274 --> 00:05:48,643
I should delay the sell-off as you had suggested.

94
00:05:48,644 --> 00:05:51,003
- Pardon? - I asked Master Kim about it,

95
00:05:51,714 --> 00:05:53,913
and he said I should take a pause to cool off a little.

96
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,743
He thinks it's a good thing that I'm touching soil these days.

97
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,052
Really?

98
00:05:59,053 --> 00:06:01,622
Touching moist soil helps remove excessive fire elements,

99
00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:03,024
so it's good for me.

100
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:06,454
And do you know what they found at the other site?

101
00:06:06,954 --> 00:06:09,024
Guess what? They found a groundwater vein.

102
00:06:09,123 --> 00:06:11,693
My gosh, his advice is always on point.

103
00:06:11,694 --> 00:06:12,933
Yes, indeed.

104
00:06:13,163 --> 00:06:17,134
Well, he called me a future president.

105
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:19,933
- He's really good. - I know.

106
00:06:20,503 --> 00:06:22,743
He's always so accurate that he scares me sometimes.

107
00:06:29,183 --> 00:06:30,243
Well...

108
00:06:31,144 --> 00:06:34,784
It seems that the odds are in your favor, sir.

109
00:06:36,154 --> 00:06:40,524
Chairman Han has too much fire in his birth chart.

110
00:06:40,623 --> 00:06:44,394
He should touch moist soil to remove the excessive fire element...

111
00:06:44,964 --> 00:06:46,264
before the sell-off,

112
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:49,264
so the excessive fire won't melt the metal.

113
00:06:50,003 --> 00:06:51,774
I will let him know.

114
00:06:59,913 --> 00:07:01,412
You made the right decision, sir.

115
00:07:01,413 --> 00:07:03,013
While I'm trying to cool things off,

116
00:07:03,014 --> 00:07:05,182
why don't I meet with the director of the FSS?

117
00:07:05,183 --> 00:07:06,612
Actually, I already called him.

118
00:07:06,613 --> 00:07:08,753
He's very fond of you, sir.

119
00:07:11,553 --> 00:07:12,594
Excuse me for a moment.

120
00:07:14,353 --> 00:07:16,422
Have you heard?

121
00:07:16,423 --> 00:07:18,792
Park So Young's sister has been arrested.

122
00:07:18,793 --> 00:07:19,894
Is that so?

123
00:07:20,493 --> 00:07:22,764
That will cause a big headache for you, Chairman Choi.

124
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:25,173
A headache is bound to go away,

125
00:07:27,303 --> 00:07:29,974
but you must be heartbroken, sir.

126
00:07:30,543 --> 00:07:33,373
I know that you were quite fond of So Young.

127
00:07:35,014 --> 00:07:36,014
Fond of her?

128
00:07:37,944 --> 00:07:38,954
Me?

129
00:07:44,683 --> 00:07:45,724
I was fond of her?

130
00:07:47,853 --> 00:07:48,894
Start the car!

131
00:07:57,063 --> 00:07:59,274
Hey. It's you, right?

132
00:08:00,173 --> 00:08:01,603
The high school girl who killed her sister.

133
00:08:02,344 --> 00:08:03,404
It's you, isn't it?

134
00:08:03,474 --> 00:08:05,714
What? What's your problem?

135
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:08,983
How dare you glare at me?

136
00:08:13,214 --> 00:08:15,482
You have no problem eating or sleeping...

137
00:08:15,483 --> 00:08:18,024
after killing your own sister. How could you eat?

138
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:19,893
How could you actually sleep?

139
00:08:19,894 --> 00:08:21,593
Yes, I can eat and sleep! So what?

140
00:08:21,594 --> 00:08:24,264
Hey! You little... Hey!

141
00:08:24,464 --> 00:08:25,493
Hey!

142
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:28,502
- Let her go! - What are you doing? Hey!

143
00:08:28,503 --> 00:08:30,003
Hey!

144
00:08:30,404 --> 00:08:31,802
- Let go! - Break it up!

(Holding Cell 2, Holding Cell 3)

146
00:08:33,904 --> 00:08:35,704
- Stop pulling my hair out! - Hey!

147
00:08:36,704 --> 00:08:38,174
- Stay put! - Darn you...

148
00:08:38,273 --> 00:08:41,214
Even after causing such a ruckus, she won't talk.

149
00:08:41,714 --> 00:08:42,982
When I was putting her...

150
00:08:42,983 --> 00:08:45,513
in solitary confinement, I asked her what I could do to make her talk.

151
00:08:45,714 --> 00:08:48,123
- Lawyer Oh Soo Jae. - What?

152
00:08:50,023 --> 00:08:51,283
Lawyer Oh Soo Jae.

153
00:08:51,623 --> 00:08:53,352
That was all she said.

154
00:08:53,353 --> 00:08:55,924
Lawyer Oh Soo Jae.

155
00:08:56,064 --> 00:08:57,723
All eyes are on this case at the moment,

156
00:08:57,724 --> 00:09:00,363
so the higher-ups are hounding us to announce the results quickly.

157
00:09:00,694 --> 00:09:02,164
But she won't even talk.

158
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,402
Seeing how spiteful she is,

159
00:09:04,403 --> 00:09:06,273
I wouldn't be surprised if she killed her sister.

160
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:10,074
I can take issue with what you said just now, right?

161
00:09:10,403 --> 00:09:11,444
Sorry?

162
00:09:12,574 --> 00:09:15,543
You investigated Park So Young's death with the conclusion in mind.

163
00:09:15,544 --> 00:09:17,413
"Close the case as suicide, no matter what."

164
00:09:17,414 --> 00:09:19,553
What are you talking about?

165
00:09:19,554 --> 00:09:21,283
It's so unfair that we have to take the heat.

166
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:24,453
Those who initially handled the case have been transferred elsewhere.

167
00:09:24,454 --> 00:09:27,194
They just dumped this on my team.

168
00:09:33,664 --> 00:09:35,403
If only they had taken a careful look at this.

169
00:09:37,934 --> 00:09:39,033
Take a look.

170
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:41,544
It's Park Ji Young's diary.

171
00:09:41,773 --> 00:09:44,373
She must've really hated her sister.

172
00:09:44,503 --> 00:09:47,043
Every day, she wrote, "I want my sister dead."

173
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,313
"I want to kill her."

174
00:09:48,314 --> 00:09:50,883
No one in their right mind would write stuff like that.

175
00:09:51,184 --> 00:09:53,653
(Security footage from TK Law Firm Building)

176
00:09:53,814 --> 00:09:57,483
If I show you this, you have to make Park Ji Young talk.

177
00:09:57,824 --> 00:10:00,424
Keep your promise, or else we'll have a problem.

178
00:10:01,694 --> 00:10:03,993
Are you asking me for a favor? Or is that a threat?

179
00:10:04,564 --> 00:10:07,233
Sorry, it's just that my higher-ups are on my case about it.

180
00:10:07,464 --> 00:10:08,603
Look.

181
00:10:09,103 --> 00:10:11,633
You see her walking up the emergency stairs, right?

182
00:10:11,704 --> 00:10:14,204
Then exactly 18 minutes later,

183
00:10:14,403 --> 00:10:16,574
you see her running down the stairs.

184
00:10:16,844 --> 00:10:18,044
And here.

185
00:10:18,674 --> 00:10:20,713
This footage is from the camera installed in front of the building.

186
00:10:20,714 --> 00:10:23,043
Park Ji Young exited the building and saw this...

187
00:10:23,044 --> 00:10:25,083
six minutes after Park So Young fell.

188
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:27,252
We could assume that it took her about 27 to 30 minutes...

189
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:29,723
to go up to the rooftop garden and come back down.

190
00:10:29,724 --> 00:10:32,392
So maybe, she ran up the stairs as fast as she could,

191
00:10:32,393 --> 00:10:34,492
pushed her sister, and ran back down.

192
00:10:34,493 --> 00:10:36,663
I mean, it's not impossible.

193
00:10:36,664 --> 00:10:38,694
And most importantly,

194
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:41,733
she was tracking the location of her sister's phone.

195
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:45,633
That's how she knew her sister was here.

196
00:10:46,503 --> 00:10:49,403
I'm telling you. This girl meticulously planned everything.

197
00:10:57,243 --> 00:10:58,753
Why did you call me here?

198
00:10:58,983 --> 00:11:00,483
So I can get out.

199
00:11:00,814 --> 00:11:03,283
What a rude way to ask someone for a favor.

200
00:11:05,294 --> 00:11:07,892
Is this police station cursed or something?

201
00:11:07,893 --> 00:11:09,424
What's with everyone?

202
00:11:11,294 --> 00:11:13,393
Goodness.

203
00:11:13,694 --> 00:11:15,633
It's your fault that my sister died.

204
00:11:16,003 --> 00:11:17,863
Because of you, I'm in this mess now.

205
00:11:18,273 --> 00:11:19,773
So you have to take responsibility.

206
00:11:23,373 --> 00:11:24,674
Tell me everything.

207
00:11:25,373 --> 00:11:28,483
Why did you want to kill your sister, and how did you kill her?

208
00:11:28,544 --> 00:11:29,643
Tell me everything.

209
00:11:30,883 --> 00:11:32,714
Only then can I help you.

210
00:11:37,824 --> 00:11:40,424
Yes, talk already.

211
00:11:43,464 --> 00:11:44,623
It wasn't me.

212
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:46,992
I didn't do it.

213
00:11:46,993 --> 00:11:48,334
Darn it.

214
00:11:49,564 --> 00:11:51,164
Do you expect me to believe that?

215
00:11:51,363 --> 00:11:55,143
Yes. If you want to help me, you have to believe me.

216
00:11:55,344 --> 00:11:57,142
Are you offering help when you don't even believe me?

217
00:11:57,143 --> 00:11:59,574
I must believe in myself, not you.

218
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:03,183
Whether or not you admit to your charges,

219
00:12:03,184 --> 00:12:05,314
I must believe that you're innocent.

220
00:12:06,513 --> 00:12:08,954
Only then can I defend you.

221
00:12:09,283 --> 00:12:10,724
That's what lawyers do, you see.

222
00:12:31,273 --> 00:12:33,814
What are they doing? Darn it.

223
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:41,353
What is that?

224
00:12:42,153 --> 00:12:43,282
A representation agreement.

225
00:12:43,283 --> 00:12:46,324
It states that Park Ji Young has agreed to hire me...

226
00:12:46,623 --> 00:12:47,724
as her attorney.

227
00:12:48,993 --> 00:12:50,393
I need to have a look.

228
00:12:52,094 --> 00:12:54,032
I am not obligated...

229
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:56,934
to show you my attorney-client agreement,

230
00:12:57,834 --> 00:12:59,974
nor can the police force me to disclose it to them.

231
00:13:05,974 --> 00:13:08,444
Eat and sleep well.

232
00:13:09,184 --> 00:13:10,543
Don't get into fights.

233
00:13:10,544 --> 00:13:12,783
I'm in solitary confinement. Who am I going to fight with?

234
00:13:14,554 --> 00:13:15,924
I like that attitude.

235
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:21,454
Ms. Oh, I understand that it's your representation agreement, but...

236
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:30,834
Hi, I'm leaving now.

237
00:13:31,564 --> 00:13:33,372
You know, those accountants.

238
00:13:33,373 --> 00:13:35,474
They've joined hands with Yoon Se Pil of SP Partners.

239
00:13:35,873 --> 00:13:38,714
I just got a text message. They're both meeting with Yoon.

240
00:13:39,044 --> 00:13:41,273
Darn it. What should we do with these traitors?

241
00:13:51,483 --> 00:13:53,493
Yes, I'm telling you.

242
00:13:54,253 --> 00:13:56,464
Wait, hold on.

243
00:14:05,503 --> 00:14:07,074
The Presidential Suite?

244
00:14:17,883 --> 00:14:19,054
The Presidential Suite?

245
00:14:19,414 --> 00:14:21,482
She went straight there?

246
00:14:21,483 --> 00:14:22,954
Yes, I'm telling you.

247
00:14:23,084 --> 00:14:24,554
I saw it with my own eyes.

248
00:14:24,623 --> 00:14:27,653
A hotel suite in broad daylight? Is she out of her mind?

249
00:14:28,664 --> 00:14:32,594
I wonder how much the suite costs for one night.

250
00:14:32,763 --> 00:14:34,293
What are you talking about?

251
00:14:34,294 --> 00:14:36,464
Right, who cares how much it costs?

252
00:14:36,704 --> 00:14:39,803
Honey, wait right there.

253
00:14:39,804 --> 00:14:42,003
And when Soo Jae comes out, take pictures.

254
00:14:42,074 --> 00:14:44,643
Who knows? You might see her leave with a married man.

255
00:14:44,873 --> 00:14:48,372
Yes, totally. That's solid evidence.

256
00:14:48,373 --> 00:14:51,853
That's right. We'll use that to take her down.

257
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:54,513
The Legal Clinic Center will become mine again,

258
00:14:54,714 --> 00:14:57,282
and you can stomp all over her. Okay?

259
00:14:57,283 --> 00:14:58,383
Sounds like a plan.

260
00:14:58,794 --> 00:15:00,594
I'm excited for a change.

261
00:15:02,594 --> 00:15:05,732
Well, they said they signed an NDA...

262
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:08,392
as soon as they started working with you,

263
00:15:08,393 --> 00:15:10,863
so I don't think you have anything to worry about.

264
00:15:11,263 --> 00:15:14,033
I can assure you that I won't try to pry intel out of them.

265
00:15:15,804 --> 00:15:17,603
Don't resent them too much.

266
00:15:18,003 --> 00:15:20,344
We can't spend the rest of our lives digging up dirt on Hansu.

267
00:15:21,444 --> 00:15:22,444
We're sorry.

268
00:15:22,684 --> 00:15:26,814
I had forgotten this saying. "Once a traitor, always a traitor."

269
00:15:35,094 --> 00:15:37,094
Ms. Oh, please take a seat.

270
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,403
Ta-da. Have some with me.

271
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:47,603
It's my favorite.

272
00:15:48,204 --> 00:15:50,403
I got you one too.

273
00:15:54,113 --> 00:15:56,883
You see, this burger is my ultimate comfort food.

274
00:15:57,113 --> 00:15:58,652
When I returned to Korea,

275
00:15:58,653 --> 00:16:01,454
I went straight to this burger joint from the airport.

276
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:04,824
I'm sure you have your own go-to comfort food.

277
00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:09,294
- I'm not sure if I do. - Oh, hold on.

278
00:16:13,993 --> 00:16:17,103
(Yeongpyeong District Development Project Now in Full Swing)

279
00:16:19,174 --> 00:16:20,704
He's certainly an interesting man, isn't he?

280
00:16:22,074 --> 00:16:24,204
Inadequately competent but overly greedy.

281
00:16:25,873 --> 00:16:29,283
Without Chairman Choi's brain, he wouldn't be where he is today.

282
00:16:29,814 --> 00:16:32,253
Of course, Chairman Han Sung Bum's money played a big role too.

283
00:16:33,084 --> 00:16:35,424
"Never give power to the greedy."

284
00:16:35,653 --> 00:16:37,954
"Never give money to the ignorant."

285
00:16:38,153 --> 00:16:39,853
"And never hand the knife over to the crazy."

286
00:16:40,853 --> 00:16:43,323
But the three of them are rolling together,

287
00:16:43,324 --> 00:16:44,694
so they sure can't be stopped.

288
00:16:48,704 --> 00:16:49,903
Do you know what my goal is?

289
00:16:51,464 --> 00:16:53,204
Taking down the three of them.

290
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:56,603
I want to see them fall hard at the same time.

291
00:17:00,143 --> 00:17:02,483
You think I'm being ridiculous, don't you? I get it.

292
00:17:03,513 --> 00:17:06,084
But you see, I'm being dead serious right now.

293
00:17:06,653 --> 00:17:08,954
Why are you telling me all this?

294
00:17:09,823 --> 00:17:11,124
Oh, I wonder why too.

295
00:17:11,654 --> 00:17:15,664
Why is it that I want to be honest with you?

296
00:17:16,523 --> 00:17:19,763
"If you want to kill someone, sit by the riverside and wait,"

297
00:17:21,134 --> 00:17:23,303
"for you will see his dead body floating down the river."

298
00:17:24,533 --> 00:17:26,503
Even if I want to take down someone,

299
00:17:26,934 --> 00:17:28,874
I don't need to do it myself.

300
00:17:30,073 --> 00:17:31,944
Why should I dirty my own hands?

301
00:17:33,444 --> 00:17:35,214
Besides, I wouldn't want to destroy my opponent...

302
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,583
under any circumstances.

303
00:17:39,454 --> 00:17:41,753
Even if it's my sworn enemy.

304
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:47,253
I want to take over while keeping it pristine.

305
00:17:48,124 --> 00:17:49,164
That's great.

306
00:17:49,964 --> 00:17:51,263
Since you put me in a good mood,

307
00:17:52,164 --> 00:17:54,033
I'd like to provide you with some intel.

308
00:17:55,434 --> 00:17:57,203
Hansu Group will announce...

309
00:17:57,204 --> 00:17:59,073
that they've decided to defer the sell-off of Hansu Bio.

310
00:17:59,634 --> 00:18:01,904
But don't worry. They're just trying to buy some time.

311
00:18:02,674 --> 00:18:03,773
And here.

312
00:18:05,444 --> 00:18:08,474
I figured they'd be useful to you.

313
00:18:13,684 --> 00:18:16,354
I'm aware of your involvement in the case.

314
00:18:17,023 --> 00:18:18,483
I hope you can make use of them.

315
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:21,792
You seem to know an awful lot.

316
00:18:21,793 --> 00:18:23,293
When you're in a position like mine,

317
00:18:23,523 --> 00:18:26,964
you hear all sorts of things just sitting at your desk.

318
00:18:27,293 --> 00:18:28,904
You'd better keep an eye on those accountants.

319
00:18:29,803 --> 00:18:31,464
If anything gets out,

320
00:18:32,674 --> 00:18:35,134
I'll take you to court.

321
00:18:46,454 --> 00:18:47,653
Who is he?

322
00:18:47,654 --> 00:18:52,194
Who was she in the suite with in broad daylight?

323
00:18:56,493 --> 00:19:00,134
Yes, she just left. I think I can work with her.

324
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:03,063
I can't believe this.

325
00:19:03,803 --> 00:19:05,063
CEO Yoon Se Pil?

326
00:19:05,303 --> 00:19:07,374
Yoon Se Pil of SP Partners?

327
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:09,273
The one who wants to acquire Hansu Bio?

328
00:19:09,343 --> 00:19:10,802
Yes, that Yoon Se Pil.

329
00:19:10,803 --> 00:19:13,414
The one with a net worth of seven billion dollars!

330
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:15,614
What? Seven billion dollars?

331
00:19:16,384 --> 00:19:17,742
But why her?

332
00:19:17,743 --> 00:19:19,883
What is a multibillionaire doing with Oh Soo Jae?

333
00:19:19,884 --> 00:19:21,313
Is she that pretty?

334
00:19:21,414 --> 00:19:23,323
What's this gibberish now? I have to go!

335
00:19:23,983 --> 00:19:25,593
I'm so annoyed.

336
00:19:25,954 --> 00:19:28,153
She is a nobody. Why would a multibillionaire...

337
00:19:28,154 --> 00:19:29,724
My gosh, seven billion dollars!

338
00:19:30,093 --> 00:19:32,733
She's so annoying. I can't stand her!

339
00:19:32,894 --> 00:19:34,894
That sly fox.

340
00:19:47,114 --> 00:19:49,644
Ms. Oh would like everyone to gather in an hour.

341
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:51,012
See you all soon.

342
00:19:51,013 --> 00:19:53,283
(Lawyer Song Mi Rim)

343
00:19:56,523 --> 00:19:58,792
We'll take on Park Ji Young's case...

344
00:19:58,793 --> 00:20:00,154
for the Legal Clinic's first case.

345
00:20:00,323 --> 00:20:02,293
Here's the case file for your reference.

346
00:20:02,964 --> 00:20:04,063
Professor Oh.

347
00:20:04,924 --> 00:20:07,434
The things we found out. Did you hand them over to the police?

348
00:20:08,904 --> 00:20:10,803
Did the police arrest Park Ji Young...

349
00:20:11,134 --> 00:20:13,803
because of the evidence we found?

350
00:20:14,704 --> 00:20:15,704
Yes, that's right.

351
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:21,013
She got arrested because of you. But now, you want to help her?

352
00:20:21,374 --> 00:20:23,083
Could you tell us your reasoning behind all this?

353
00:20:23,884 --> 00:20:25,614
Find out on your own...

354
00:20:25,714 --> 00:20:27,954
why I did what I did and why I'm doing this now.

355
00:20:30,184 --> 00:20:32,793
Do you believe that Park Ji Young is innocent?

356
00:20:33,793 --> 00:20:35,563
I never believe my clients.

357
00:20:36,063 --> 00:20:37,894
I believe in my ability to defend my clients.

358
00:20:39,964 --> 00:20:41,194
Your clients...

359
00:20:42,904 --> 00:20:45,874
You never believe your clients?

360
00:20:46,073 --> 00:20:48,133
Whether I believe them or not isn't important.

361
00:20:48,134 --> 00:20:50,104
Proving them not guilty.

362
00:20:50,644 --> 00:20:51,944
That is my job as a lawyer.

363
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:57,313
So find evidence to prove that Park Ji Young is not guilty.

364
00:20:58,184 --> 00:20:59,654
Focus on the possibility...

365
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:02,224
of the real culprit being someone else.

366
00:21:16,164 --> 00:21:18,733
Ms. Oh and Ji Young exchanged these notes in the interview room.

367
00:21:19,104 --> 00:21:20,934
Where is the phone?

368
00:21:27,013 --> 00:21:29,444
Someone stole it the day after I posted the video.

369
00:21:31,644 --> 00:21:34,512
The police had closed the case as suicide, so she doesn't trust them.

370
00:21:34,513 --> 00:21:35,553
That's what this tells me.

371
00:21:37,224 --> 00:21:40,093
Is there someone Ms. Oh suspects as the culprit?

372
00:21:40,624 --> 00:21:43,893
I'm not sure. I think she wants us to find out on our own.

373
00:21:43,894 --> 00:21:45,933
Then give us some pointers.

374
00:21:45,934 --> 00:21:47,194
If I were you,

375
00:21:47,394 --> 00:21:50,303
I'd look for Park So Young's phone, which Park Ji Young lost.

376
00:21:50,664 --> 00:21:51,933
Based on the notes, I'd say...

377
00:21:51,934 --> 00:21:55,333
the most likely culprit is probably the person who stole the phone.

378
00:21:55,674 --> 00:21:57,003
I see.

379
00:21:57,503 --> 00:22:01,072
Also, it seems like you guys can't fully trust Ms. Oh...

380
00:22:01,073 --> 00:22:03,313
because Park Ji Young suddenly got arrested,

381
00:22:03,843 --> 00:22:07,454
but Ms. Oh is a lot more thoughtful and warmhearted than you think.

382
00:22:08,654 --> 00:22:10,154
Trust me on this.

383
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:12,894
All right, then. You can do it!

384
00:22:14,053 --> 00:22:16,493
- "Warmhearted"? - We shall trust you.

385
00:22:16,924 --> 00:22:19,193
Her loyalty to her boss is commendable.

386
00:22:19,194 --> 00:22:21,894
I think Ms. Song is cool.

387
00:22:23,104 --> 00:22:24,134
Right?

388
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:26,773
Yes.

389
00:22:36,513 --> 00:22:38,013
I never believe my clients.

390
00:22:38,543 --> 00:22:40,414
I believe in my ability to defend my clients.

391
00:22:43,823 --> 00:22:45,184
I believe you.

392
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:53,934
Make sure you call a designated driver!

393
00:22:59,874 --> 00:23:02,444
Someone is oozing loneliness.

394
00:23:03,343 --> 00:23:06,144
Oh Soo Jae, the loneliest woman in the entire universe!

395
00:23:06,273 --> 00:23:09,713
No, I am not lonely.

396
00:23:09,714 --> 00:23:11,243
Sure, whatever.

397
00:23:11,944 --> 00:23:12,983
Cheers!

398
00:23:19,424 --> 00:23:23,723
My gosh. This tastes extra spicy and delicious today.

399
00:23:23,724 --> 00:23:27,763
Hey, why are you drinking nonstop? Have some food!

400
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,634
I ordered your favorite dish.

401
00:23:30,634 --> 00:23:32,772
- Have you ever kissed a guy first? - Auntie!

402
00:23:32,773 --> 00:23:35,032
We want our rolled omelet with pollack roe!

403
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:36,302
Okay, it's coming!

404
00:23:36,303 --> 00:23:39,714
Great, it's coming. You can eat that.

405
00:23:39,843 --> 00:23:43,343
Why won't she give us our food? It's so annoying...

406
00:23:43,684 --> 00:23:45,213
What's the point of telling you?

407
00:23:45,214 --> 00:23:47,654
You never listen, you quack.

408
00:23:53,694 --> 00:23:55,553
No one can cook eel like you do.

409
00:23:56,194 --> 00:23:58,224
What those guys make never tastes this good.

410
00:23:59,434 --> 00:24:02,164
So, how's law school? Have you got a girlfriend?

411
00:24:03,563 --> 00:24:04,563
No.

412
00:24:04,564 --> 00:24:07,974
What's wrong with you? You're a healthy, young man.

413
00:24:08,303 --> 00:24:10,644
Hey, maybe you should go see a doctor or something.

414
00:24:11,073 --> 00:24:13,914
Auntie, I'm totally fine.

415
00:24:14,273 --> 00:24:15,443
I'm full of vim and vigor.

416
00:24:15,444 --> 00:24:16,783
Goodness gracious.

417
00:24:18,283 --> 00:24:21,414
Hey, have you ever been in a relationship?

418
00:24:21,684 --> 00:24:23,383
There's someone I have a crush on.

419
00:24:23,384 --> 00:24:26,153
Really? Who is she? Is she pretty?

420
00:24:26,154 --> 00:24:27,394
Is she your classmate?

421
00:24:27,793 --> 00:24:28,854
She is pretty.

422
00:24:29,964 --> 00:24:31,864
She's cool and amazing.

423
00:24:35,733 --> 00:24:39,104
But today, my heart ached for her.

424
00:24:39,803 --> 00:24:40,904
Why?

425
00:24:41,404 --> 00:24:43,974
Because she can't see that you have feelings for her?

426
00:24:44,374 --> 00:24:45,503
My goodness.

427
00:24:47,743 --> 00:24:50,644
It must've been so hard to get to where she is now.

428
00:24:52,753 --> 00:24:54,253
I'm sure there were times...

429
00:24:55,513 --> 00:24:57,523
when she had to be mean to people...

430
00:24:58,523 --> 00:25:00,454
and say nasty things.

431
00:25:01,593 --> 00:25:02,624
Auntie.

432
00:25:03,664 --> 00:25:05,124
You know,

433
00:25:07,194 --> 00:25:10,904
even if you're the sweetest person in the whole wide world,

434
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,333
there are times...

435
00:25:15,404 --> 00:25:17,243
when you have to act mean to beat others.

436
00:25:21,644 --> 00:25:23,113
That's true.

437
00:25:23,114 --> 00:25:26,783
Otherwise, people would think you're a joke and stomp all over you.

438
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:30,383
Hey, that's why...

439
00:25:30,384 --> 00:25:33,752
you have to be all prickly like an angry hedgehog...

440
00:25:33,753 --> 00:25:35,492
and say mean things at times...

441
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:37,993
to survive and win in life.

442
00:25:39,394 --> 00:25:40,394
Exactly.

443
00:25:41,563 --> 00:25:42,604
That's why...

444
00:25:43,904 --> 00:25:45,063
That is exactly why...

445
00:25:46,273 --> 00:25:48,674
I felt bad for her...

446
00:25:49,644 --> 00:25:50,644
earlier today.

447
00:25:51,444 --> 00:25:53,874
She's such a beautiful, inspiring, and wonderful person,

448
00:25:56,283 --> 00:25:58,384
but I don't think she knows that about herself.

449
00:26:01,283 --> 00:26:03,924
And I feel like bad things keep happening to her...

450
00:26:05,154 --> 00:26:07,293
as if she's just surrounded by people who want her to suffer.

451
00:26:11,023 --> 00:26:12,093
I think that's why...

452
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,263
she always sounds so cold.

453
00:26:19,233 --> 00:26:21,003
I want to get her out of the rut.

454
00:26:22,134 --> 00:26:23,374
Anyway, that's how I feel.

455
00:26:24,904 --> 00:26:27,444
It sounds like you're head over heels for this girl.

456
00:26:27,743 --> 00:26:32,482
You see, that's what happens when you really like someone.

457
00:26:32,483 --> 00:26:35,253
Your heart goes out to her for no reason,

458
00:26:35,414 --> 00:26:37,553
and you want to do whatever it takes to make her happy.

459
00:26:38,154 --> 00:26:41,454
Hey, see that fool over there?

460
00:26:41,894 --> 00:26:45,224
I just couldn't stop worrying about him for no reason...

461
00:26:45,323 --> 00:26:48,063
and felt like he'd die without me.

462
00:26:50,934 --> 00:26:52,434
I can't believe I'm laughing about this now.

463
00:26:54,803 --> 00:26:55,833
But the thing is,

464
00:26:58,343 --> 00:26:59,974
I think she has a boyfriend.

465
00:27:00,374 --> 00:27:03,313
What? She's seeing someone?

466
00:27:03,543 --> 00:27:05,013
I happened to overhear...

467
00:27:05,483 --> 00:27:08,153
that she's dating a guy whose net worth is seven billion dollars.

468
00:27:08,154 --> 00:27:10,154
Seven billion? What do you mean?

469
00:27:10,553 --> 00:27:12,052
"Billion" as in, after 100 million dollars.

470
00:27:12,053 --> 00:27:14,354
You know, like 1 million, 2 million, and so on.

471
00:27:14,654 --> 00:27:18,523
My goodness. What are you going to do, then?

472
00:27:18,593 --> 00:27:20,763
You can't beat a guy who has seven billion dollars.

473
00:27:21,993 --> 00:27:23,664
Why can't I beat him?

474
00:27:24,634 --> 00:27:26,733
My heart is worth 70 billion dollars.

475
00:27:27,003 --> 00:27:31,003
I see that you're getting tipsy after half a bottle.

476
00:27:31,674 --> 00:27:34,613
Sure, your heart is worth 70 billion dollars.

477
00:27:34,614 --> 00:27:36,843
Good for you.

478
00:27:44,553 --> 00:27:47,654
Auntie, can I borrow your umbrella?

479
00:27:47,753 --> 00:27:49,293
What? Are you leaving?

480
00:27:57,503 --> 00:28:00,473
Hey, this is too much.

481
00:28:00,474 --> 00:28:02,532
Why did you drink so much?

482
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:04,503
You're too drunk to even do simple math.

483
00:28:04,704 --> 00:28:07,174
I told you. My heart is worth 70 billion dollars.

484
00:28:12,043 --> 00:28:15,384
Yes! Seven billion dollars is no biggie.

485
00:28:16,224 --> 00:28:17,483
Just ask her out.

486
00:28:18,283 --> 00:28:19,354
Wish me luck.

487
00:28:19,993 --> 00:28:21,023
You can do it!

488
00:28:43,983 --> 00:28:48,114
I think Ms. Oh is having an affair with Yoon Se Pil.

489
00:28:48,384 --> 00:28:50,252
I bet that's why she took Hansu Bio's records...

490
00:28:50,253 --> 00:28:52,354

00:37:43,354 --> 00:37:45,183
- Move? - Right?

654
00:37:45,184 --> 00:37:47,894
Of course. Six thousand is nothing.

655
00:37:48,394 --> 00:37:51,823
You could get about 60,000 in no time.

656
00:37:53,734 --> 00:37:54,794
Sixty...

657
00:37:55,693 --> 00:37:57,763
You know I'm working on the legal clinic with Soo Jae, right?

658
00:37:59,504 --> 00:38:03,104
Why did that woman, Park So Young, fall from that building?

659
00:38:03,544 --> 00:38:06,374
We thought that she committed suicide because of Ms. Oh,

660
00:38:06,673 --> 00:38:09,243
but her younger sister got arrested as a murder suspect.

661
00:38:10,184 --> 00:38:12,484
We'll find out when the results of the investigation are announced.

662
00:38:14,484 --> 00:38:15,713
Is Father or Ju Wan...

663
00:38:17,423 --> 00:38:19,383
involved with that case?

664
00:38:20,794 --> 00:38:21,954
No, they're not.

665
00:38:23,124 --> 00:38:25,423
- Are you sure? - That question is very insulting...

666
00:38:26,164 --> 00:38:28,394
to the two of them.

667
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:32,334
That's a relief.

668
00:38:33,033 --> 00:38:36,673
Gosh. Why do I still feel worried even after you've told me that?

669
00:38:48,113 --> 00:38:50,883
I got him extremely drunk as you asked.

670
00:38:51,184 --> 00:38:53,693
He'll answer any questions you have.

671
00:38:54,193 --> 00:38:55,623
I didn't come here today.

672
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,423
Don't worry, sir.

673
00:38:57,564 --> 00:39:01,394
I'll delete the security camera footage so there's no trace at all.

674
00:39:08,403 --> 00:39:09,474
Gosh.

675
00:39:10,204 --> 00:39:12,274
My uncle, Han Sung Bum, took everything from my dad...

676
00:39:12,604 --> 00:39:15,314
and didn't even give him a cent.

677
00:39:16,443 --> 00:39:19,414
My cousin, Han Dong O, looks down on me like I'm some dog.

678
00:39:20,814 --> 00:39:22,254
It's not fair.

679
00:39:23,084 --> 00:39:25,024
It's so not fair.

680
00:39:25,124 --> 00:39:28,024
You're right. I know how loyal you were.

681
00:39:28,254 --> 00:39:31,092
They never gave you the respect you deserve. I know.

682
00:39:31,093 --> 00:39:34,064
Thanks for buying me a drink.

683
00:39:37,533 --> 00:39:40,504
I'm only telling you this,

684
00:39:42,033 --> 00:39:45,303
I have the files Soo Jae took. Every single one of them.

685
00:39:46,104 --> 00:39:48,742
Really? Every single one of them?

686
00:39:48,743 --> 00:39:49,743
Yes.

687
00:39:50,113 --> 00:39:52,943
Then you have the files? So...

688
00:39:53,044 --> 00:39:55,083
Gosh. There are just so many files.

689
00:39:55,084 --> 00:39:56,854
And going over them sounds like a hassle.

690
00:39:58,084 --> 00:40:00,724
I thought about just returning them to you.

691
00:40:05,064 --> 00:40:06,663
Is there anything you want to get back?

692
00:40:06,664 --> 00:40:08,893
If I tell you, will you really give it to me?

693
00:40:08,894 --> 00:40:10,033
Will you?

694
00:40:16,274 --> 00:40:17,903
The black USB flash drive.

695
00:40:18,274 --> 00:40:20,474
We custom-ordered them to celebrate our company's anniversary.

696
00:40:20,613 --> 00:40:22,173
I just need that back.

697
00:40:23,743 --> 00:40:26,184
I see. That?

698
00:40:31,153 --> 00:40:33,854
Gosh. Ki Taek.

699
00:40:34,954 --> 00:40:36,024
Hello?

700
00:40:37,463 --> 00:40:38,763
How effective.

701
00:40:48,704 --> 00:40:49,974
Gosh. Thank you.

702
00:40:51,544 --> 00:40:53,473
He'll wake up tomorrow afternoon.

703
00:40:53,474 --> 00:40:56,544
When he wakes up, he won't remember what he did the night before.

704
00:40:56,713 --> 00:41:00,053
He will have no memories of this. And he'll only have a headache.

705
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:04,684
The elders said that you were quite useful for many projects.

706
00:41:04,783 --> 00:41:06,224
Right.

707
00:41:06,653 --> 00:41:08,723
Thanks to Chairman Han,

708
00:41:08,724 --> 00:41:11,294
I had a chance to work for Assemblyman Lee and Chairman Choi.

709
00:41:11,423 --> 00:41:14,163
And when Chairman Choi gives me tasks,

710
00:41:14,164 --> 00:41:15,493
I handle them myself, not my subordinates.

711
00:41:15,763 --> 00:41:17,862
He likes to keep things clean.

712
00:41:17,863 --> 00:41:19,633
He hates it when other people handle his business.

713
00:41:22,734 --> 00:41:27,172
If there are things you need to resolve quietly,

714
00:41:27,173 --> 00:41:29,672
I'll treat them like tasks from your father...

715
00:41:29,673 --> 00:41:32,513
and see them through all the way to make you happy, sir.

716
00:41:34,354 --> 00:41:35,454
Nice.

717
00:41:36,053 --> 00:41:37,053
Thank you.

718
00:41:46,724 --> 00:41:48,993
Dad, are you watching me?

719
00:41:49,164 --> 00:41:50,503
What about me?

720
00:41:50,504 --> 00:41:53,504
- You guys are great. Go play now. - See you.

721
00:41:58,874 --> 00:42:00,513
Your kids are cute.

722
00:42:02,173 --> 00:42:04,144
Ms. Oh.

723
00:42:04,613 --> 00:42:05,984
Do you exercise here?

724
00:42:08,184 --> 00:42:10,382
I saw the file for the 27-million-dollar slush fund.

725
00:42:10,383 --> 00:42:12,684
But there were many locked files.

726
00:42:14,524 --> 00:42:16,763
Ms. Oh. Could you...

727
00:42:18,863 --> 00:42:20,293
Why don't you just kill me instead?

728
00:42:20,294 --> 00:42:23,863
"Why did he hide all the files in the USB flash drive?"

729
00:42:25,204 --> 00:42:27,073
I've given it some thought.

730
00:42:27,704 --> 00:42:28,734
Insurance.

731
00:42:31,374 --> 00:42:34,113
It was your insurance in case you ended up in a crisis.

732
00:42:36,243 --> 00:42:38,913
Chairman Han. Assemblyman Lee. Chairman Choi.

733
00:42:38,914 --> 00:42:42,254
It was like a ledger that could bring down all of them in one go.

734
00:42:43,053 --> 00:42:45,353
Of course, you would be ruined too.

735
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,354
But you wouldn't be going down alone.

736
00:42:47,823 --> 00:42:50,993
Insurance that clearly showed your intention.

737
00:42:55,193 --> 00:42:57,204
Should I pretend I didn't find this?

738
00:43:02,073 --> 00:43:03,172
What's your condition?

739
00:43:03,173 --> 00:43:04,903
I need your answers to three of my questions.

740
00:43:06,974 --> 00:43:08,044
What are they?

741
00:43:08,474 --> 00:43:09,474
My first question.

742
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:12,484
The relationship between Park So Young and the trio.

743
00:43:13,243 --> 00:43:16,783
I got a tip that Park So Young was quite cozy with Chairman Han.

744
00:43:17,124 --> 00:43:18,754
But I think it's more than that.

745
00:43:19,124 --> 00:43:22,294
I wonder if she was only cozy with Chairman Han.

746
00:43:23,454 --> 00:43:24,463
My second question.

747
00:43:24,963 --> 00:43:26,592
Who helped you...

748
00:43:26,593 --> 00:43:29,564
pocket 27 million dollars behind your uncle's back?

749
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:34,633
I've been watching you for about ten years.

750
00:43:35,533 --> 00:43:38,443
And I know that you don't have the guts to pocket that much money.

751
00:43:39,604 --> 00:43:42,073
My third question. The sale of Hansu Bio.

752
00:43:42,573 --> 00:43:43,984
I want it to resume right away.

753
00:43:45,843 --> 00:43:47,753
I can picture what Chairman Han did.

754
00:43:47,754 --> 00:43:50,283
I bet he told you to postpone the sale out of the blue. Right?

755
00:43:51,984 --> 00:43:54,724
Find out who's behind this nonsense.

756
00:43:54,954 --> 00:43:56,294
And make it resume.

757
00:44:01,734 --> 00:44:03,564
Your kids are adorable.

758
00:44:06,734 --> 00:44:08,204
They must take after their mother.

759
00:44:10,843 --> 00:44:11,974
Hello.

760
00:44:19,443 --> 00:44:21,814
(Good Ads: CEO Han Ki Taek, Jeongja-dong, Bundang-gu, Seongnam)

761
00:44:34,334 --> 00:44:36,063
I heard the arrest warrant was issued,

762
00:44:36,064 --> 00:44:37,633
so she was moved to the detention center.

763
00:44:37,763 --> 00:44:39,104
Do you think there's a way?

764
00:44:40,033 --> 00:44:42,974
I have a meeting with the team. We'll find a way.

765
00:44:43,403 --> 00:44:45,303
I met with Chairman Choi yesterday.

766
00:44:50,544 --> 00:44:53,713
Tell me if there's anything you need for the Legal Clinic.

767
00:44:55,613 --> 00:44:57,684
It's not because my son is in it.

768
00:45:01,894 --> 00:45:03,624
But I do have one concern.

769
00:45:04,593 --> 00:45:06,724
Please keep the lines clear.

770
00:45:12,004 --> 00:45:13,974
I'm not trying to pressure you.

771
00:45:14,434 --> 00:45:16,704
The Legal Clinic can take on any case.

772
00:45:17,044 --> 00:45:19,104
And that decision belongs to you as the director.

773
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:23,274
I just don't want you to worry the people around you.

774
00:45:24,113 --> 00:45:25,783
You never know what can happen.

775
00:45:26,984 --> 00:45:29,383
Letting nature take its course is the best.

776
00:45:30,624 --> 00:45:32,153
Chairman Choi's opinion...

777
00:45:33,693 --> 00:45:35,553
matters a lot to you.

778
00:45:39,524 --> 00:45:42,334
Even before you brought it up, the Legal Clinic took on...

779
00:45:42,434 --> 00:45:44,863
Park Ji Young's case and has been investigating the case.

780
00:45:46,164 --> 00:45:47,803
I already made the decision.

781
00:45:48,573 --> 00:45:50,673
And I will take responsibility for the concerns people have.

782
00:45:52,144 --> 00:45:53,943
I'm not sure if that's letting nature take its course.

783
00:45:55,113 --> 00:45:57,544
Well, does that matter?

784
00:46:02,184 --> 00:46:04,382
The day Park Ji Young's house got burgled,

785
00:46:04,383 --> 00:46:05,782
a suspicious man was captured...

786
00:46:05,783 --> 00:46:07,624
on the security camera in front of her house.

787
00:46:17,564 --> 00:46:19,533
I tried to zoom into the footage,

788
00:46:19,734 --> 00:46:23,204
but I couldn't get the license plate number or the man's face.

789
00:46:24,443 --> 00:46:25,903
His gait is unusual, right?

790
00:46:27,113 --> 00:46:28,414
You're right.

791
00:46:30,213 --> 00:46:33,084
Nice, Detective Cho. You got us a lead.

792
00:46:34,283 --> 00:46:36,383
Checking the gait of people...

793
00:46:36,553 --> 00:46:38,584
who could have broken into the house could be helpful.

794
00:46:38,984 --> 00:46:40,024
Professor Oh.

795
00:46:42,653 --> 00:46:46,193
I think Park So Young was pregnant when she passed away.

796
00:46:46,693 --> 00:46:47,794
Pregnant?

797
00:46:50,664 --> 00:46:52,203
Did you know about this?

798
00:46:52,204 --> 00:46:54,173
Yes. I knew.

799
00:46:55,303 --> 00:46:58,243
But I thought it had nothing to do with her death.

800
00:46:59,004 --> 00:47:00,274
So I didn't tell you.

801
00:47:00,414 --> 00:47:03,273
If you look at the file, you'll see Park So Young requested...

802
00:47:03,274 --> 00:47:04,913
a paternity test for the baby.

803
00:47:04,914 --> 00:47:08,084
That's against the law. She ran a paternity test?

804
00:47:08,584 --> 00:47:10,153
That's why she requested it to an agency abroad.

805
00:47:10,783 --> 00:47:13,184
And the report arrived after she had died.

806
00:47:14,024 --> 00:47:16,553
Park Ji Young kept the report in her school locker.

807
00:47:17,363 --> 00:47:18,462
Her school locker?

808
00:47:18,463 --> 00:47:21,132
I get it. Because her house was burgled?

809
00:47:21,133 --> 00:47:23,334
So she got rid of the name tag on her locker.

810
00:47:23,664 --> 00:47:26,503
Then it's highly likely that the man Park So Young was seeing...

811
00:47:26,504 --> 00:47:28,033
is the real culprit.

812
00:47:34,173 --> 00:47:36,743
(Prosecutor Bae Sun Wook)

813
00:47:47,923 --> 00:47:49,724
You can't show up without an appointment.

814
00:47:51,624 --> 00:47:53,064
Check this before you judge.

815
00:47:55,993 --> 00:47:57,164
Fine.

816
00:47:57,664 --> 00:47:59,633
The Legal Clinic Center or whatever that is...

817
00:47:59,863 --> 00:48:01,773
is in the limelight with the press coverage.

818
00:48:01,774 --> 00:48:03,633
So I understand that you're impatient.

819
00:48:04,443 --> 00:48:07,143
But if you're here to cut a deal for a plea bargain,

820
00:48:07,144 --> 00:48:08,713
you can take it back.

821
00:48:09,774 --> 00:48:12,213
If you leave now, I'll pretend this never happened.

822
00:48:12,943 --> 00:48:15,484
Don't think about cutting a deal with me.

823
00:48:16,484 --> 00:48:17,653
Please leave quietly.

824
00:48:19,984 --> 00:48:21,923
Gosh. Seriously.

825
00:48:26,363 --> 00:48:29,193
Those of you who like spicy food will go crazy with this.

826
00:48:29,934 --> 00:48:32,363
- Gosh. - Who is this clown?

827
00:48:33,204 --> 00:48:35,504
Yeonnam definitely has the best chicken feet.

828
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,004
The one in Yeonnam-dong.

829
00:48:39,403 --> 00:48:40,814
This has a lot of collagen.

830
00:48:41,743 --> 00:48:43,374
So this is good for your skin.

831
00:48:44,743 --> 00:48:45,783
Gosh, it's spicy.

832
00:48:48,184 --> 00:48:50,684
- What? Where is this? - But I won't drink water.

The rooftop garden of TK Law Firm.

834
00:49:03,463 --> 00:49:05,234
We don't have to take this to court.

835
00:49:06,434 --> 00:49:07,834
Let Park Ji Young go.

836
00:49:11,803 --> 00:49:13,743
Park Ji Young is getting released today.

837
00:49:13,843 --> 00:49:16,613
Really? That's great. Good work, Ms. Oh.

838
00:49:16,914 --> 00:49:18,484
I can tell the team, right?

839
00:49:18,513 --> 00:49:19,544
Sure.

840
00:49:19,684 --> 00:49:22,052
Right. I just got what you asked me to get.

841
00:49:22,053 --> 00:49:23,113
I'll put it on your desk.

844
00:49:35,633 --> 00:49:36,933
About the DNA report...

845
00:49:36,934 --> 00:49:39,203
It only confirmed the paternal relationship...

846
00:49:39,204 --> 00:49:40,734
between the subject and the fetus. So we must find out...

847
00:49:42,204 --> 00:49:43,903
who the father is.

848
00:49:44,104 --> 00:49:45,673

Yes.

I hear that Park Ji Young is getting out.

853
00:50:04,524 --> 00:50:05,724
Good work.

854
00:50:06,024 --> 00:50:07,263
Thank you.

855
00:50:07,294 --> 00:50:08,893
You handled it nicely without going to court.

856
00:50:08,894 --> 00:50:10,394

Chief Prosecutor Choi Tae Guk...

860
00:50:25,613 --> 00:50:27,954
will retire as soon as he wraps up this case.

861
00:50:28,084 --> 00:50:30,113
And once he retires, he will set up a law firm.

862
00:50:30,454 --> 00:50:33,323
Let nature take its course, and join his law firm.

863

865

He's very worried about you.

Hey.

Eun Seo. Don't you like these?

879
00:52:23,633 --> 00:52:26,762
You'll get arrested soon...

880
00:52:26,763 --> 00:52:28,334
for the murder of Park So Young.

881
00:52:29,173 --> 00:52:31,172
- What? - Stay in there for a bit.

882
00:52:31,173 --> 00:52:32,604
I'll get you out.

Have you gone mad? You must be out of your mind.

884

The medical bills are overdue.

885
00:52:41,613 --> 00:52:43,354
And you're behind on rent too.

886
00:52:43,854 --> 00:52:45,584
That's all because of you.

887

My sister died because of you!

00:52:47,754 --> 00:52:49,124
Stop lying to yourself!

889
00:52:51,263 --> 00:52:52,894
You also know it wasn't me.

890
00:52:53,093 --> 00:52:54,564
Tell me what you really want.

891
00:52:58,334 --> 00:52:59,403
Reinvestigation.

892
00:53:03,274 --> 00:53:04,544
I want the police to reinvestigate.

893

Once you get arrested,

894

Your sister left.

It will still haunt you.

906

But live your own life. You must.

907
00:53:55,653 --> 00:53:57,423
And keep your guard up.

908
00:53:58,923 --> 00:54:00,763
Don't let anyone tell you what to do.

909

- Hey. - I wanted to apologize.

913
00:54:30,354 --> 00:54:31,394
For what?

914
00:54:31,763 --> 00:54:35,294
I got the wrong idea that you handed over Park Ji Young to the police.

915
00:54:36,493 --> 00:54:38,133
But you said you still trusted me.

916
00:54:38,363 --> 00:54:41,874
I did, but still. It's true that I got the wrong idea.

917
00:54:42,604 --> 00:54:43,633
Like a fool.

918
00:54:45,544 --> 00:54:48,073
I won't do that again. Never.

919
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,544
I can promise you.

920
00:54:51,283 --> 00:54:52,414
Good work...

921
00:54:53,883 --> 00:54:55,113
to you too.

922
00:54:55,883 --> 00:54:58,354
I know you worked hard, and you did a good job.

923
00:54:59,854 --> 00:55:01,894
- No. - Jo Gab.

924
00:55:02,653 --> 00:55:04,093
He's talking to a girl.

925
00:55:05,923 --> 00:55:08,993
And there is one more misunderstanding.

926
00:55:11,033 --> 00:55:12,033
Pardon?

927
00:55:12,034 --> 00:55:14,274
The seven-billion-dollar guy isn't my boyfriend.

928
00:55:15,104 --> 00:55:16,133
What?

929
00:55:23,673 --> 00:55:25,484
I must be out of my mind.

930
00:55:36,653 --> 00:55:38,863
Seven billion dollars is no biggie.

931
00:55:42,394 --> 00:55:45,204
Gosh. Come on!

932
00:55:49,533 --> 00:55:52,204
She must have dumped him when he asked her out.

933
00:55:53,144 --> 00:55:54,743
I shouldn't have drunk alcohol.

Professor Oh?

937
00:57:37,374 --> 00:57:39,683
Hey, it's me. You're almost here?

938
00:57:39,684 --> 00:57:41,282
Right. It's the building across from school.

939
00:57:41,283 --> 00:57:42,783
It's 23 Yulseo-ro 2-gil.

940
00:57:42,854 --> 00:57:44,584
Come to the second floor.

941
00:57:54,834 --> 00:57:56,192
Hey, if you go after her when she dumped you,

942
00:57:56,193 --> 00:57:57,433
she'll hate you!

943
00:57:57,434 --> 00:57:58,604
Don't go to her!

944
00:58:09,874 --> 00:58:12,383
What are you doing? Who are you?

945
00:58:32,434 --> 00:58:35,403
(Why Her?)

946
00:58:53,454 --> 00:58:55,753
We received an incident report last night.

947
00:58:55,754 --> 00:58:57,623
There was a burglary report from the building.

948
00:58:57,624 --> 00:58:59,563
And it was Ms. Oh Soo Jae's building.

949
00:58:59,564 --> 00:59:00,862
I ought to check...

950
00:59:00,863 --> 00:59:03,862
the face he makes when he sees me after doing something like that.

951
00:59:03,863 --> 00:59:05,664
You fool!

952
00:59:06,504 --> 00:59:08,032
If you try to steal something...

953
00:59:08,033 --> 00:59:09,933
or hurt someone...

954
00:59:09,934 --> 00:59:11,742
Are you trying to find him? You shouldn't.

955
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:13,873
You might be in danger again. Don't do anything.

956
00:59:13,874 --> 00:59:15,473
Soo Jae must be looking for the flash drive.

957
00:59:15,474 --> 00:59:17,172
It might be better if she doesn't know until we open it...

958
00:59:17,173 --> 00:59:18,584
and check what's inside.

959
00:59:18,684 --> 00:59:21,454
An entree must be served after the appetizer.

960
00:59:23,454 --> 00:59:24,783
Tell your chairman to come.
