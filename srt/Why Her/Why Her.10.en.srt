1
00:00:09,057 --> 00:00:11,455
(This is a work of fiction. All characters, places, incidents,)

2
00:00:11,456 --> 00:00:13,996
(and organizations portrayed in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:16,697
(Episode 10)

4
00:00:22,537 --> 00:00:24,436
(Cup Noodles, Coffee, Green Tea, Ginseng Tea, Yuzu Tea)

5
00:00:26,877 --> 00:00:28,107
They all seem happy.

6
00:00:31,017 --> 00:00:33,346
But when you take a closer look at their lives, you'll see...

7
00:00:34,287 --> 00:00:35,916
that they all have their own problems.

8
00:00:36,717 --> 00:00:38,686
They get angry and fight too.

9
00:00:39,116 --> 00:00:40,316
They may yell and fight.

10
00:00:40,317 --> 00:00:42,586
But when mealtime rolls around, they eat together.

11
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,796
And after that, they're back on good terms.

12
00:00:45,696 --> 00:00:49,266
Then they laugh and work together. That's probably how it goes,

13
00:00:50,126 --> 00:00:52,796
which is very different from the world where I live in.

14
00:00:59,777 --> 00:01:01,046
Later on...

15
00:01:02,546 --> 00:01:05,817
Maybe I should move to a place like this many years later.

16
00:01:08,046 --> 00:01:09,987
Would these people not welcome me?

17
00:01:10,216 --> 00:01:11,586
I'm sure they'll welcome you.

18
00:01:12,187 --> 00:01:13,816
You can be their legal advisor.

19
00:01:13,817 --> 00:01:17,157
Instead of money, they'll pay you with dried seaweed...

20
00:01:17,657 --> 00:01:19,025
and fresh fish.

21
00:01:19,026 --> 00:01:21,866
Then I can make spicy fish stew and side dishes with them.

22
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:26,866
That'd be so nice. I'm getting excited even just thinking about it.

23
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:29,736
I make such a delicious spicy fish stew.

24
00:01:29,737 --> 00:01:31,036
You do all the cooking.

25
00:01:31,037 --> 00:01:33,275
I'll hang out here as soon as I'm done providing consultations.

26
00:01:33,276 --> 00:01:34,377
Okay.

27
00:01:39,276 --> 00:01:40,446
I find this so fascinating.

28
00:01:40,946 --> 00:01:44,416
I was always determined to do more,

29
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:47,356
go further, and soar higher...

30
00:01:48,127 --> 00:01:50,386
than everyone else.

31
00:01:54,256 --> 00:01:55,996
Who knew I'd begin to think this way?

32
00:02:09,106 --> 00:02:10,407
Should I turn on the radio?

33
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:33,297
I didn't doze off.

34
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:36,436
I was just engrossed in thought.

35
00:02:37,737 --> 00:02:38,737
I know.

36
00:02:39,336 --> 00:02:40,536
Don't laugh.

37
00:02:42,947 --> 00:02:44,077
Of course, I won't.

38
00:03:00,827 --> 00:03:02,126
But you know what, Chan?

39
00:03:02,526 --> 00:03:03,766
If you like someone,

40
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,096
you shouldn't deceive them for a long time.

41
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:15,846
- Father. - Yes.

42
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:18,916
I agreed to move back in on the condition...

43
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:22,116
that you wouldn't touch Soo Jae, Chan, and everyone else...

44
00:03:23,616 --> 00:03:25,816
at the Legal Clinic Center. You remember that, right?

45
00:03:26,487 --> 00:03:29,586
I'm your son, so I am quite patient, just like you.

46
00:03:29,727 --> 00:03:32,496
But I take after Mom too, so I am emotionally sensitive.

47
00:03:35,626 --> 00:03:38,137
When someone comes after people I care about,

48
00:03:40,267 --> 00:03:41,607
I go crazy.

49
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:44,637
You take after me more.

50
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,607
Ju Wan.

51
00:03:47,137 --> 00:03:49,477
You don't believe that Hong Seok Pal actually took his own life, right?

52
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:56,387
Stop talking nonsense and just eat your breakfast.

53
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:58,257
Hey, come on.

54
00:03:59,556 --> 00:04:00,987
You must be curious too.

55
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,797
- Just get to the point. - Leave them alone, Father.

56
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:09,927
Asking for a favour? Watch your attitude.

57
00:04:12,496 --> 00:04:13,697
I'm not asking for a favour.

58
00:04:16,107 --> 00:04:17,667
I am your son after all.

59
00:04:18,336 --> 00:04:22,046
I can be as ruthless as you... No. Perhaps, I can do worse things,

60
00:04:23,707 --> 00:04:25,947
since you're saying I'm more like you than Mom.

61
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:33,557
(Chairman Han Sung Bum)

62
00:04:37,356 --> 00:04:39,057
Hello, Chairman Han. What's up?

63
00:04:39,356 --> 00:04:42,295
Hey, I gave them the go-ahead to publish some articles.

64
00:04:42,296 --> 00:04:43,496
(Yeongpyeong District, Hansu Construction)

65
00:04:43,497 --> 00:04:46,036
Yoon Se Pil, that slimy loach.

66
00:04:46,137 --> 00:04:48,807
I figured we should sprinkle some salt to make him move.

67
00:04:49,106 --> 00:04:51,207
They suddenly put it on pause.

68
00:04:51,507 --> 00:04:53,936
Then they told the media that we were uncooperative...

69
00:04:53,937 --> 00:04:56,577
during the due diligence process.

70
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:01,387
Did those idiots actually think that I'd just sit back and do nothing?

71
00:05:01,716 --> 00:05:03,516
Honestly, I just wanted to go ahead...

72
00:05:03,517 --> 00:05:06,786
and cancel their preferred bidder status,

73
00:05:07,017 --> 00:05:10,187
but Oh Soo Jae will make a move. So let's wait and see.

74
00:05:10,286 --> 00:05:13,627
She recommended Min Young Bae for Gi Taek's position.

75
00:05:13,757 --> 00:05:17,426
That tells me that Soo Jae will now get actively involved.

76
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:20,036
It just means that there's another pawn on the chess board now.

77
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:21,966
It'll be fun to watch.

78
00:05:24,577 --> 00:05:25,637
Chairman Choi.

79
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:28,476
Do you know why I think Oh Soo Jae is cute?

80
00:05:28,707 --> 00:05:31,377
She has no idea that she's nothing but a pawn.

81
00:05:32,617 --> 00:05:34,947
How adorable. She's so cute.

82
00:05:36,617 --> 00:05:38,817
That's why pawns are so limited in what they can do.

83
00:05:39,457 --> 00:05:42,586
All right, let's play some chess. It's been so long.

84
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,827
Okay.

85
00:05:46,957 --> 00:05:48,397
How cute.

86
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:49,567
Hold on.

87
00:05:50,827 --> 00:05:51,966
What's that?

88
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:54,196
- Oh, this is... - What's leaking here?

89
00:05:54,197 --> 00:05:57,835
We've recently had a few underground water leaks.

90
00:05:57,836 --> 00:06:00,336
- Another in-depth inspection... - You little...

91
00:06:00,476 --> 00:06:02,806
Oh, that won't be necessary.

92
00:06:02,807 --> 00:06:04,946
We have had a few underground water leaks...

93
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,416
and other minor issues,

94
00:06:06,447 --> 00:06:07,915
but it's nothing to worry about, sir.

95
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,345
It's very common.

96
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:10,546
You're sure, right?

97
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:12,856
Hey, Mr. Park. Sit down.

98
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:16,925
I like you, but you need to stop worrying about small things.

99
00:06:16,926 --> 00:06:18,626
Go big, or go home.

100
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:19,697
Yes, sir.

101
00:06:19,997 --> 00:06:23,166
This is a big site. A few leaks and small collapses...

102
00:06:23,426 --> 00:06:25,396
are to be expected. Don't you all agree?

103
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:26,796
- Yes, sir. - Absolutely, sir.

104
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,535
According to Hansu Group,

105
00:06:28,536 --> 00:06:31,405
Hansu Bio proactively cooperated during the due diligence process...

106
00:06:31,406 --> 00:06:33,306
despite the pressure imposed on the management,

107
00:06:33,307 --> 00:06:35,306
but SP Partners made a unilateral decision to hit pause.

108
00:06:35,307 --> 00:06:38,215
The company spokesperson emphasized it's unfortunate that SP Partners...

109
00:06:38,216 --> 00:06:40,447
suddenly made such a decision to buy time.

110
00:06:40,877 --> 00:06:43,116
Regarding the sell-off of Hansu Bio, Hansu Group also...

111
00:06:43,117 --> 00:06:45,956
I'd like to meet with the Hansu Bio acquisition task force now.

112
00:06:45,957 --> 00:06:47,585
After being selected as the preferred bidder...

113
00:06:47,586 --> 00:06:50,386
(Hansu Group Calls SP Partners' Decision "Unfortunate")

114
00:06:50,387 --> 00:06:53,356
(SP Partners' Preferred Bidder Status Likely to Be Cancelled)

115
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:54,766
Yes.

116
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:56,526
Hello, Ms. Oh. It's me, Yoon Se Pil.

117
00:06:57,026 --> 00:06:58,767
Let's resume, today.

118
00:06:59,697 --> 00:07:01,197
They're propelling us to make a move,

119
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:04,207
so we should take action.

120
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:06,006
You know that Min Young Bae...

121
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:08,546
is now Hansu Group's chief legal officer, right?

122
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,517
He'll attend the meeting as a member of Hansu's retinue.

123
00:07:14,947 --> 00:07:16,617
Yes, all right.

124
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,187
Is something wrong?

125
00:07:22,057 --> 00:07:24,426
Oh, no. It's all good.

126
00:07:25,226 --> 00:07:27,057
- Are you heading out now? - Yes.

127
00:07:28,226 --> 00:07:29,296
I was wondering...

128
00:07:31,226 --> 00:07:34,267
Can we meet on the rooftop tonight?

129
00:07:35,307 --> 00:07:36,367
Sure.

130
00:07:37,536 --> 00:07:38,606
Let's go.

131
00:07:47,377 --> 00:07:48,845
- Hey. - Hi.

132
00:07:48,846 --> 00:07:50,845
Professor Oh, did everything go well?

133
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:53,256
Yes. I'm sorry. You couldn't use your car because of me.

134
00:07:53,257 --> 00:07:56,025
No, don't worry about it. Have you eaten yet? Eat with us.

135
00:07:56,026 --> 00:07:59,356
We're good. We had cup noodles on the beach.

136
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:02,497
- Cup noodles? - On the beach?

137
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:05,666
While watching the clouds pass by? Love's in the air.

138
00:08:05,867 --> 00:08:07,136
Hey, cut it out.

139
00:08:07,137 --> 00:08:09,937
Well, I'm running late. I have to go.

140
00:08:13,307 --> 00:08:15,747
I have to go to school too. See you.

141
00:08:18,216 --> 00:08:20,376
While having the cup noodles on the beach,

142
00:08:20,377 --> 00:08:22,285
your heart must've fluttered.

143
00:08:22,286 --> 00:08:24,386
While watching the fleecy clouds pass by...

144
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:25,617
While listening to the seagulls...

145
00:08:25,817 --> 00:08:28,025
- Squawk. - Squawk.

146
00:08:28,026 --> 00:08:29,887
Hey, cut it out!

147
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:31,627
- I have to go. - Squawk.

148
00:08:31,997 --> 00:08:33,655
(Tasanjiseok)

149
00:08:33,656 --> 00:08:34,897
I'm so jealous.

150
00:08:35,466 --> 00:08:37,597
Good for you, Chan!

151
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:39,936
You'll only be there for a little while.

152
00:08:40,637 --> 00:08:43,967
I'm letting Chairman Han borrow you because he urgently needs your help.

153
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:46,107
You belong...

154
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,446
to me and TK.

155
00:08:50,546 --> 00:08:51,877
Thank you, sir.

156
00:08:53,517 --> 00:08:56,516
- Help Chairman Han out. - Yes, sir.

157
00:08:56,517 --> 00:08:58,785
You'll have to visit us often anyway,

158
00:08:58,786 --> 00:09:00,915
- Right. - so I'll see you soon.

159
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,026
Yes, sir.

160
00:09:08,426 --> 00:09:11,296
"You belong to me." My, that gave me goosebumps.

161
00:09:12,796 --> 00:09:15,906
- Hello, sir! - Hey, you.

162
00:09:16,107 --> 00:09:19,736
My gosh. Our new chief legal officer is still here.

163
00:09:19,737 --> 00:09:21,545
Is Chairman Choi refusing to let you go?

164
00:09:21,546 --> 00:09:23,545
No, sir. I was just in his office to say my goodbyes.

165
00:09:23,546 --> 00:09:25,815
And the meeting for the sell-off is taking place here later today.

166
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:28,916
- Is that right? - Yes, I'll let you know right away.

167
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:30,347
Okay, sounds good.

168
00:09:39,857 --> 00:09:42,967
Professor Jung, thank you for all your hard work.

169
00:09:43,026 --> 00:09:44,896
I'm so happy for you.

170
00:09:44,897 --> 00:09:48,467
But if things go really well, Professor Jung may go on...

171
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:50,606
to become the presidential spokesperson.

172
00:09:50,607 --> 00:09:53,477
My gosh! Don't get my hopes up.

173
00:09:53,706 --> 00:09:55,747
Presidential spokesperson? Please!

174
00:09:55,977 --> 00:09:58,346
I heard your husband recently got a new job as well...

175
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,746
and that Professor Oh recommended him for the position.

176
00:10:00,747 --> 00:10:02,117
That's right.

177
00:10:02,316 --> 00:10:05,387
Soo Jae is always looking out for me and my husband.

178
00:10:06,217 --> 00:10:08,986
- I see. - She has a heart of gold.

179
00:10:08,987 --> 00:10:10,056
What?

180
00:10:10,956 --> 00:10:13,756
Well, that's true. Anyone who helps you is a good friend.

181
00:10:13,757 --> 00:10:16,065
- That's right. - Yes. Let's drink.

182
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:18,666
- All right. Congratulations. - Thank you.

183
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,925
(Senior Presidential Secretary for Personnel Affairs)

184
00:10:42,926 --> 00:10:44,627
Yes, the Senior Presidential Secretary for Personnel Affairs.

185
00:10:44,956 --> 00:10:47,456
What's going on? Why is he with Director Baek?

186
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:53,035
Soo Jae, I haven't told anyone else yet.

187
00:10:53,036 --> 00:10:54,466
I saw Director Baek...

188
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:56,406
with the Senior Presidential Secretary for Personnel Affairs.

189
00:10:57,107 --> 00:10:59,106
Justice Minister Hwang Sang Gyu announced on the 23rd...

190
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:01,075
that he had decided to resign.

191
00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:02,705
Regarding the presidential race, he said...

192
00:11:02,706 --> 00:11:05,876
he needed more time to think and that it'd be a difficult decision,

193
00:11:05,877 --> 00:11:07,116
but according to his inner circle...

194
00:11:07,117 --> 00:11:08,847
- See you soon. - Yes, take care.

195
00:11:13,117 --> 00:11:17,227
I told Director Baek that it was solely the President's decision.

196
00:11:18,227 --> 00:11:19,426
Yes, that's great.

197
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:22,796
Director Baek must be excited about the offer.

198
00:11:23,026 --> 00:11:25,737
The administration is nearing its end, but still. It's huge.

199
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,696
There will be a confirmation hearing,

200
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:30,035
but nothing will be brought up against him.

201
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:31,267
I guarantee you that.

202
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,477
Yes, sounds good.

203
00:11:38,076 --> 00:11:39,276
Well...

204
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,987
Once Director Baek is appointed Minister of Justice,

205
00:11:43,147 --> 00:11:45,617
let's work on getting Gi Taek out as soon as possible.

206
00:11:45,786 --> 00:11:48,987
He's never around when I need him. Look, he's behind bars now.

207
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:53,757
I know.

208
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:59,396
He's just like his father. What an idiot.

209
00:11:59,397 --> 00:12:01,367
I was going to make him...

210
00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:03,966
cough up my money that he had embezzled...

211
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,376
and fire him once the sell-off was completed.

212
00:12:06,377 --> 00:12:08,275
Who knew he'd end up in jail...

213
00:12:08,276 --> 00:12:09,847
for getting himself involved in Seok Pal's death?

214
00:12:10,377 --> 00:12:12,147
Good grief. What a mess.

215
00:12:14,546 --> 00:12:16,486
We'll get him out at an opportune time...

216
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:18,757
- so he can wrap up the cruise. - Yes.

217
00:12:21,257 --> 00:12:22,757
Ms. Oh...

218
00:12:23,987 --> 00:12:25,857
sent Min Young Bae to me...

219
00:12:26,326 --> 00:12:28,997
and sent his wife to Assemblyman Lee.

220
00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:31,565
What a sly fox.

221
00:12:31,566 --> 00:12:34,737
She really is cute.

222
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:36,637
Chairman Choi.

223
00:12:38,576 --> 00:12:40,206
You lost all your key pieces.

224
00:12:51,587 --> 00:12:53,416
The sell-off commission of 70 million dollars.

225
00:12:54,686 --> 00:12:57,785
After we help fund Assemblyman Lee's campaign,

226
00:12:57,786 --> 00:12:59,256
send some to the Bahamas,

227
00:12:59,257 --> 00:13:01,597
and pay off Hansu Construction's debts,

228
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:05,535
how much do you think will end up in your hands?

229
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:08,165
I'd say about 25 percent.

230
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:11,267
My goodness. You did all the work.

231
00:13:11,607 --> 00:13:14,107
I feel bad that you can't even take half of it.

232
00:13:17,107 --> 00:13:19,746
You should've moved the horse.

233
00:13:19,747 --> 00:13:23,387
But you moved the pawn just so I could capture another one.

234
00:13:23,816 --> 00:13:26,487
I got involved in this knowing that was how it'd be,

235
00:13:26,816 --> 00:13:27,986
so it's fine, sir.

236
00:13:27,987 --> 00:13:29,526
No, don't say that.

237
00:13:30,286 --> 00:13:34,056
To stay motivated, you need something to look forward to.

238
00:13:34,156 --> 00:13:35,397
This is not good.

239
00:13:37,796 --> 00:13:40,036
I'll pay you out of my own pocket if I need to.

240
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:45,576
I'll make sure you can take 50 percent.

241
00:13:45,837 --> 00:13:47,877
So listen, Chairman Choi. Hong Seok Pal's videos...

242
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:50,206
that show my face.

243
00:13:50,306 --> 00:13:54,076
Destroy them in front of me, right now.

244
00:13:54,776 --> 00:13:57,716
You know that they're safe in my possession.

245
00:13:57,717 --> 00:13:59,716
Yes, I know that.

246
00:13:59,717 --> 00:14:03,127
But what if a rat steals them and disseminates them?

247
00:14:03,257 --> 00:14:05,056
You must remember the scandal from a year ago.

248
00:14:05,357 --> 00:14:07,097
Chairman Sung of Sungmyeong Group.

249
00:14:07,357 --> 00:14:10,396
He fooled around with girls at his safe house.

250
00:14:10,397 --> 00:14:12,065
But that was all caught on a hidden camera.

251
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:14,196
It was beyond embarrassing.

252
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:16,206
And the company's stock price plummeted.

253
00:14:16,936 --> 00:14:18,977
Right. He ended up stepping down.

254
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:20,806
After I saw that,

255
00:14:21,406 --> 00:14:25,647
I listed my houses in Samjung-dong and Hannam-dong for sale.

256
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,776
No one showed interest in them until recently.

257
00:14:27,847 --> 00:14:32,686
Finally, there's someone who wants to buy them.

258
00:14:33,316 --> 00:14:35,426
Anyway, listen.

259
00:14:35,487 --> 00:14:38,696
You'll never see me step down.

260
00:14:40,627 --> 00:14:41,867
I'd rather die...

261
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:46,867
than step down. It simply won't happen.

262
00:14:47,796 --> 00:14:50,206
No matter what happens. Never.

263
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:22,007
(Chairman Han Sung Bum)

264
00:15:23,137 --> 00:15:25,237
(Assemblyman Lee In Soo)

265
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,617
(Chairman Han Sung Bum)

266
00:15:50,597 --> 00:15:52,137
(Chairman Han Sung Bum)

267
00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:57,837
You don't need to give me that money, sir.

268
00:16:01,276 --> 00:16:02,306
Chairman Choi.

269
00:16:03,107 --> 00:16:05,147
What do you want?

270
00:16:06,076 --> 00:16:08,617
Tell me, whatever it is. I'll give you anything you want.

271
00:16:10,487 --> 00:16:11,546
I can trust you, right?

272
00:16:15,117 --> 00:16:17,186
The situation has changed quite a bit.

273
00:16:17,656 --> 00:16:19,726
Due diligence revealed that the company was poorly managed.

274
00:16:19,727 --> 00:16:21,256
The subsidiaries' lawsuits.

275
00:16:21,257 --> 00:16:23,226
Risky clinical trials for the new drug.

276
00:16:23,227 --> 00:16:26,137
On top of that, Chief Legal Officer Han Gi Taek has committed a crime.

277
00:16:26,436 --> 00:16:29,935
We're anxious and concerned as problems keep popping up.

278
00:16:29,936 --> 00:16:32,637
No conglomerate with multiple subsidiaries...

279
00:16:32,776 --> 00:16:34,607
is problem-free.

280
00:16:35,806 --> 00:16:36,946
"Poorly managed"?

281
00:16:38,046 --> 00:16:41,016
I know exactly how you acquired other companies...

282
00:16:41,017 --> 00:16:43,316
to grow SP Partners to what it is today.

283
00:16:44,217 --> 00:16:46,056
But with us, that simply won't fly.

284
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:49,127
All right. Let's all calm down.

285
00:16:49,387 --> 00:16:51,285
The buyer wants the seller to hand over all the information,

286
00:16:51,286 --> 00:16:53,127
but the seller refuses.

287
00:16:53,357 --> 00:16:55,196
You see it all the time in M and A deals.

288
00:16:55,967 --> 00:16:58,397
Both sides should make concessions and find the middle ground.

289
00:16:59,296 --> 00:17:00,296
Ms. Oh.

290
00:17:00,397 --> 00:17:02,905
It is true that the conditions SP Partners demanded...

291
00:17:02,906 --> 00:17:05,036
were excessive, to say the least.

292
00:17:05,507 --> 00:17:07,436
Phase-three clinical trial with proven results.

293
00:17:07,637 --> 00:17:09,946
A partnership agreement with Bache, the German pharma company.

294
00:17:10,107 --> 00:17:11,916
Pay back the convertible note for 50 million dollars.

295
00:17:12,446 --> 00:17:14,016
And the stock price must reach 120 dollars.

296
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:19,616
Hansu Bio did their best to meet the terms.

297
00:17:19,617 --> 00:17:20,656
You do agree with that, right?

298
00:17:20,817 --> 00:17:21,986
Well, that's...

299
00:17:23,956 --> 00:17:26,496
You can't deny that Hansu made a lot of effort.

300
00:17:26,597 --> 00:17:30,226
You need to reciprocate for this to work out,

301
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,337
but you keep demanding things with such haste.

302
00:17:32,897 --> 00:17:34,436
I suggest you pace yourself.

303
00:17:34,766 --> 00:17:36,266
We never rushed Hansu Bio.

304
00:17:37,637 --> 00:17:40,736
You went ahead and interviewed Hansu Bio's employees...

305
00:17:41,137 --> 00:17:43,976
to hear their opinions on the company's overall situation.

306
00:17:44,107 --> 00:17:45,206
However,

307
00:17:45,516 --> 00:17:48,117
you sussed them out hoping they'd leak confidential info.

308
00:17:48,716 --> 00:17:50,787
Doing such interviews...

309
00:17:51,117 --> 00:17:53,516
will only ruin the trust between the two companies.

310
00:17:53,716 --> 00:17:57,057
Well, you could think that.

311
00:17:57,156 --> 00:17:59,456
- But in our position... - Exactly.

312
00:17:59,726 --> 00:18:01,195
We're having problems...

313
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:03,026
because the two companies' positions are too different.

314
00:18:03,027 --> 00:18:04,566
To get things sorted out,

315
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:06,936
Hansu hired a new chief legal officer.

316
00:18:08,766 --> 00:18:11,765
Right. Mr. Min, I look forward to working with you.

317
00:18:11,766 --> 00:18:12,807
Thank you.

318
00:18:13,206 --> 00:18:15,476
You say that our requests are excessive.

319
00:18:15,607 --> 00:18:18,175
But Hansu's debts drastically increased after we made our offer,

320
00:18:18,176 --> 00:18:20,277
And the additional gains we never agreed upon.

321
00:18:20,547 --> 00:18:22,446
There are certain things that we must check.

322
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,685
The issues with the new drug make us anxious too.

323
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,416
Why are you so anxious and doubtful?

324
00:18:27,587 --> 00:18:29,986
You're nitpicking everything now,

325
00:18:30,087 --> 00:18:32,057
so you can back out of the deal later. Am I wrong?

326
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:37,866
Director Han, would you spare me a moment?

327
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,137
- Right now... - Director Han.

328
00:18:51,906 --> 00:18:55,546
You must all know that Director Han has a short fuse.

329
00:18:55,547 --> 00:18:57,617
So don't take it to heart.

330
00:18:57,817 --> 00:19:00,985
You have to conduct due diligence again. We'll actively collaborate.

331
00:19:00,986 --> 00:19:02,755
Let's please wrap it up in two weeks.

332
00:19:02,756 --> 00:19:04,356
Two weeks won't be enough time.

333
00:19:04,357 --> 00:19:07,357
He said they'd actively collaborate, so let's do that.

334
00:19:07,926 --> 00:19:09,067
What do you say?

335
00:19:12,397 --> 00:19:13,567
All right.

336
00:19:13,797 --> 00:19:16,266
But you said you'd actively collaborate.

337
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:18,367
You must keep your word.

338
00:19:20,736 --> 00:19:22,777
Yoon Se Pil, that arrogant weasel.

339
00:19:23,107 --> 00:19:25,277
I understand he wants to buy Hansu Bio.

340
00:19:26,547 --> 00:19:27,675
But how dare he think...

341
00:19:27,676 --> 00:19:30,446
he can criticize my management style just because he's buying Hansu Bio?

342
00:19:31,216 --> 00:19:33,617
Hey, don't get so worked up at these meetings.

343
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,426
Why give them something to complain about?

344
00:19:36,186 --> 00:19:38,326
KG Air's M and A deal fell through...

345
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:39,626
because of their uncooperative attitude.

346
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:41,756
The company almost went bust. You saw all that.

347
00:19:41,956 --> 00:19:43,866
Hansu Bio should be careful too.

348
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:45,496
- If not... - Hey, Choi Ju Wan.

349
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:47,736
I'll up your commission.

350
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:52,307
I'll make sure you can walk away with 300,000 dollars more.

351
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:57,547
Actually, no. I'll pay you out of my own pocket if I must.

352
00:19:58,446 --> 00:20:00,317
I'll make sure you can get 500,000 dollars more.

353
00:20:00,676 --> 00:20:02,317
So what I'm saying is...

354
00:20:03,647 --> 00:20:06,087
Just keep your mouth shut and listen to me.

355
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,156
Listen to what I say and take my side.

356
00:20:08,617 --> 00:20:10,156
That's your job after all.

357
00:20:10,357 --> 00:20:12,996
Just do that, and I'll pay you. Okay?

358
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:17,397
Don't raise your voice.

359
00:20:18,837 --> 00:20:21,936
You're not at Hansu Group. You're at TK Law Firm.

360
00:20:23,206 --> 00:20:24,337
TK?

361
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,307
Hey,

362
00:20:27,176 --> 00:20:29,647
how do you think TK Law Firm started?

363
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:31,776
Without my father's help,

364
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:33,347
there wouldn't have been TK Law Firm.

365
00:20:36,847 --> 00:20:38,047
What's he doing?

366
00:20:40,617 --> 00:20:42,786
This was his 28th volunteer activity to deliver...

367
00:20:42,787 --> 00:20:44,755
That's hilarious.

368
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:47,725
Chairman Lee Si Hyuk, Candidate Lee In Soo's son,

369
00:20:47,726 --> 00:20:50,725
- delivered 1,900 briquettes... - That's ridiculous.

370
00:20:50,726 --> 00:20:53,096
with other volunteers from the truck...

371
00:20:53,097 --> 00:20:54,736
and shared neighbourly love.

372
00:20:55,137 --> 00:20:58,005
- Hey, go easy on the briquette act. - This volunteer work...

373
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,837
It's cracking me up, you fool.

374
00:21:01,137 --> 00:21:02,577
I got it.

375
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:07,277
I'm with Ju Wan right now. Come out. I'll buy you a drink.

376
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,117
You two go ahead. I'm not drinking.

377
00:21:11,516 --> 00:21:13,716
Okay. Ju Wan is coming too.

378
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:22,527
I want to buy Han Sung Bum's safe house in Samjung-dong.

379
00:21:22,726 --> 00:21:24,527
What's your take on it?

380
00:21:24,897 --> 00:21:27,297
I'm not an expert on real estate.

381
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:29,536
The house has been vacant for ten years.

382
00:21:29,537 --> 00:21:32,376
And the house came out on the market a year ago.

383
00:21:32,377 --> 00:21:35,175
It's such a big property, so no one bought it.

384
00:21:35,176 --> 00:21:37,807
I happened to find out recently. I wish I had known before.

385
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:41,746
Why are you interested in that house?

386
00:21:42,516 --> 00:21:44,746
You know, there are times...

387
00:21:45,117 --> 00:21:47,616
you want something without any good reasons...

388
00:21:47,617 --> 00:21:49,887
regardless of the price.

389
00:21:50,287 --> 00:21:51,387
Go on.

390
00:21:51,557 --> 00:21:52,656
It crossed my mind...

391
00:21:53,226 --> 00:21:56,797
that if I bought it, it would be useful someday.

392
00:21:58,627 --> 00:22:02,307
It sounds like you're giving me information, not seeking advice.

393
00:22:03,107 --> 00:22:06,077
"I'll buy that house. It will be useful."

394
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,986
I made up my mind thanks to you.

395
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:27,926
This house is in the best location in Samjung-dong.

396
00:22:28,996 --> 00:22:32,337
The chairman was very interested in feng shui.

397
00:22:32,466 --> 00:22:35,297
He said everything worked out well after building this house.

398
00:22:36,436 --> 00:22:39,676
This house is 27 years old.

399
00:22:39,837 --> 00:22:41,636
About 10 or 9 years ago,

400
00:22:41,637 --> 00:22:44,446
he renovated the entire house.

401
00:22:45,147 --> 00:22:48,647
It's been vacant for a long time, but it's well-maintained.

402
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,416
- This way, please. - Sure.

403
00:22:56,357 --> 00:22:58,486
Chairman Han's house in Samjung-dong?

404
00:22:58,956 --> 00:23:01,597
Find out about the house quietly. I think there's a reason behind it.

405
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:04,367
Is it possible...

406
00:23:05,266 --> 00:23:06,867
that Mr. Yoon...

407
00:23:07,736 --> 00:23:09,466
likes you?

408
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:13,607
- What? - You know, men do that.

409
00:23:14,107 --> 00:23:16,277
When my friend was dating her husband,

410
00:23:16,377 --> 00:23:18,175
he suddenly showed an apartment unit to her...

411
00:23:18,176 --> 00:23:19,215
and said he was going to buy it.

412
00:23:19,216 --> 00:23:21,515
He proposed to her by bringing up the house.

413
00:23:21,516 --> 00:23:22,587
Stop it.

414
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:24,816
Find out about the house...

415
00:23:24,817 --> 00:23:26,486
and what's between Chairman Han and Mr. Yoon.

416
00:23:28,216 --> 00:23:31,057
I'm sure there's something even if it's small. Go find it.

417
00:23:45,537 --> 00:23:48,607
I bought this house.

418
00:24:37,027 --> 00:24:38,887
Hey! Stop!

419
00:24:42,527 --> 00:24:43,726
I'll find it.

420
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:48,297
I'll tear down the wallpaper, remove the flooring,

421
00:24:49,337 --> 00:24:50,966
and check every gap between the tiles.

422
00:24:52,377 --> 00:24:54,337
I'm sure there's something left behind.

423
00:25:38,087 --> 00:25:39,357
When are you coming home?

424
00:25:40,057 --> 00:25:41,156
I'll be there soon.

425
00:26:09,117 --> 00:26:10,186
Yoon Sang.

426
00:26:11,016 --> 00:26:12,246
Soo Jae isn't here?

427
00:26:13,117 --> 00:26:14,416
I'm home.

428
00:26:15,256 --> 00:26:16,726
You're here, right?

429
00:26:29,837 --> 00:26:31,037
What are these?

430
00:26:31,706 --> 00:26:33,807
- Why do you have... - I told you.

431
00:26:35,406 --> 00:26:37,706
I told you to be careful because Chan is on my father's radar.

432
00:26:38,047 --> 00:26:40,777
But you ignored what I said and are still staying here.

433
00:26:41,047 --> 00:26:43,986
Are you telling me your father had someone take these photos?

434
00:26:45,317 --> 00:26:46,857
But why do you have them?

435
00:26:47,087 --> 00:26:48,656
Because I took them from him.

436
00:27:27,357 --> 00:27:28,627
Give me the camera.

437
00:27:28,656 --> 00:27:30,096
What?

438
00:27:30,097 --> 00:27:32,126
I'll pay you three times more than what you were supposed to get.

439
00:27:32,127 --> 00:27:33,367
Give it to me.

440
00:27:37,337 --> 00:27:39,777
Getting photographed isn't a big deal.

441
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:41,777
Why did you do such a useless thing?

442
00:27:42,807 --> 00:27:44,107
Useless?

443
00:27:46,246 --> 00:27:49,016
This is it. I'm here to tell you that.

444
00:27:49,887 --> 00:27:51,716
I'm going to be his son now.

445
00:27:52,656 --> 00:27:56,226
So the first thing I'm studying is Hansu Bio's sell-off.

446
00:27:56,726 --> 00:27:58,557
The contract was ridiculous.

447
00:27:59,057 --> 00:28:01,057
How did you get them to agree to that deal?

448
00:28:10,706 --> 00:28:12,067
Tell your father...

449
00:28:13,206 --> 00:28:15,236
- if he does this again... - What can you do?

450
00:28:16,777 --> 00:28:19,817
Do you think you can do anything? Against my father?

451
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:23,216
Right.

452
00:28:24,147 --> 00:28:26,117
Do your best to protect Soo Jae.

453
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:29,827
But you will have to do better than me...

454
00:28:30,887 --> 00:28:32,387
because you have less power than me.

455
00:28:37,627 --> 00:28:38,797
No, Yoon Sang.

456
00:28:44,706 --> 00:28:46,877
You have conflicts of interest.

457
00:28:47,637 --> 00:28:49,377
So you'll stop here. But not me.

458
00:28:50,377 --> 00:28:51,706
I'll risk everything I have to protect her.

459
00:28:52,406 --> 00:28:55,746
So you have a nice life as Chairman Choi Tae Guk's son.

I'm sorry too.

No.

467
00:30:33,976 --> 00:30:35,347
I'm more sorry.

00:30:48,027 --> 00:30:49,766

Why don't you just give me Jae Yi?

00:32:29,127 --> 00:32:31,695
You can't even put up with it once? Why are you so angry?

491
00:32:31,696 --> 00:32:33,765
If you wish to get what you want out of this divorce,

492
00:32:33,766 --> 00:32:35,466
tell me what you gave to Soo Jae.

493
00:32:35,696 --> 00:32:37,666
Father, if you want to know that,

494
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:41,475
you'll first have to tell me who Jae Yi's biological mother is.

495
00:32:41,476 --> 00:32:43,606
Why do you want to know that after all this time?

496
00:32:43,607 --> 00:32:45,676
It doesn't even matter, and nothing good will come out of it.

497
00:32:45,777 --> 00:32:47,547
It may not matter to you,

498
00:32:48,547 --> 00:32:51,246
but it's been haunting me for the past eight years.

499
00:32:53,986 --> 00:32:55,357
I want to check.

500
00:33:00,656 --> 00:33:03,466
She said, "I want to check," not "I want to know."

501
00:33:06,337 --> 00:33:10,006
As for Ms. Oh and Gong Chan, nothing out of the ordinary yet.

502
00:33:10,506 --> 00:33:12,107
I'll keep checking, sir.

503
00:33:12,307 --> 00:33:13,377
Okay.

504
00:33:16,406 --> 00:33:17,906
Let's go to Seojung Law School.

505
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:19,976
Yes, sir.

506
00:33:22,246 --> 00:33:23,787
Hello, it's me.

507
00:33:25,547 --> 00:33:27,056
Honestly,

508
00:33:27,057 --> 00:33:30,425
I never once imagined I'd end up in such a position.

509
00:33:30,426 --> 00:33:32,426
That's all the more reason why you should do it.

510
00:33:32,587 --> 00:33:36,867
Minister Hwang suddenly resigned to run for President.

511
00:33:37,367 --> 00:33:40,067
But you've devoted your life's work to protecting the law.

512
00:33:40,567 --> 00:33:43,107
An incorruptible man like you surely deserves the position.

513
00:33:45,206 --> 00:33:47,807
In fact, I think it should've happened sooner.

514
00:33:47,877 --> 00:33:49,337
You should've been appointed long ago.

515
00:33:49,807 --> 00:33:54,346
My goodness. Stop flattering me. I don't even know what to say.

516
00:33:54,347 --> 00:33:55,617
About the confirmation hearing,

517
00:33:55,847 --> 00:33:59,887
I'll help you, so we can make sure it goes smoothly.

518
00:34:00,287 --> 00:34:02,087
Gosh, I don't know what to say.

519
00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:05,827
I'll be off, then.

520
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:10,726
I'll be in touch.

521
00:34:21,377 --> 00:34:22,706
I'll call you.

522
00:34:30,817 --> 00:34:33,257
Gosh, where is it?

523
00:34:33,556 --> 00:34:35,987
- Where is it? - Are you looking for something?

524
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:39,157
Yes. What was it called? Legal...

525
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:41,126
We're looking for some kind of center.

526
00:34:41,127 --> 00:34:44,325
It had "clinic" in the name.

527
00:34:44,326 --> 00:34:45,765
The Legal Clinic Center?

528
00:34:45,766 --> 00:34:47,196
- Yes! - Yes, that's it.

529
00:34:47,197 --> 00:34:48,567
Hello, sir.

530
00:34:49,067 --> 00:34:50,636
Perfect timing.

531
00:34:50,806 --> 00:34:52,406
You can follow her.

532
00:34:52,407 --> 00:34:54,305
They're looking for the Legal Clinic Center.

533
00:34:54,306 --> 00:34:56,706
I see. You can come with me.

534
00:34:57,607 --> 00:34:59,206
- Thank you. - Have a good day.

535
00:35:00,277 --> 00:35:03,246
Professor Oh will be there today. You picked the right day.

536
00:35:03,817 --> 00:35:05,886
- It's this way. - Thank you.

537
00:35:11,857 --> 00:35:14,156
These ladies were scammed.

538
00:35:14,157 --> 00:35:16,766
- My gosh. - That beauty company is horrible.

539
00:35:16,967 --> 00:35:18,697
- Come on in. - You can sit here.

540
00:35:26,476 --> 00:35:28,737
Soon Ok can't see well.

541
00:35:28,806 --> 00:35:31,276
Really? I had no idea.

542
00:35:31,277 --> 00:35:34,816
I'm sorry. Did I make you uncomfortable?

543
00:35:34,817 --> 00:35:38,987
No, not at all. I really appreciate your help.

544
00:35:39,116 --> 00:35:42,615
She can see shapes. People and cars. Stuff like that.

545
00:35:42,616 --> 00:35:43,927
Right, Soon Ok?

546
00:35:44,686 --> 00:35:46,185
Thank you for coming all the way here.

547
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:48,427
Drink this and tell us what happened.

548
00:35:50,866 --> 00:35:54,435
- We work at the same factory. - I see.

549
00:35:54,436 --> 00:35:56,265
One day, we got a call from a skincare company.

550
00:35:56,266 --> 00:35:59,676
They said they'd send samples, so we told them to go ahead.

551
00:35:59,677 --> 00:36:01,876
Then they sent us tons of samples,

552
00:36:01,877 --> 00:36:03,846
so we were all excited to try them.

553
00:36:04,047 --> 00:36:05,845
But they suddenly told us that we had to pay.

554
00:36:05,846 --> 00:36:08,376
Seven hundred dollars per person!

555
00:36:08,377 --> 00:36:11,286
Please write down your contact information. We'll help you.

556
00:36:11,817 --> 00:36:14,185
Professor Jung Hee Young is resigning.

557
00:36:14,186 --> 00:36:16,286
Really? We have new clients here.

558
00:36:18,726 --> 00:36:20,356
Are they here for a consultation?

559
00:36:20,357 --> 00:36:22,726
Yes. I ran into them, so I brought them here.

560
00:36:22,797 --> 00:36:26,326
Nice to meet you. Make yourselves at home and tell us what happened.

Kim Dong Gu.

563
00:36:40,647 --> 00:36:41,717
Right?

564
00:36:43,016 --> 00:36:44,217
Kim Dong Gu?

565
00:36:45,016 --> 00:36:46,346
Who is Kim Dong Gu?

566
00:36:48,056 --> 00:36:49,386
You are Dong Gu.

567
00:36:51,326 --> 00:36:53,096
Kim Dong Gu.

568
00:36:53,257 --> 00:36:56,967
- No... - No, ma'am. His name is Gong Chan.

569
00:36:59,366 --> 00:37:03,036
She can't see well. She probably mistook you for someone else.

570
00:37:03,536 --> 00:37:06,636
Kim Dong Gu!

571
00:37:07,237 --> 00:37:10,377
No. That young man is not Kim Dong Gu.

572
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:20,757
Kim Dong Gu!

573
00:37:21,817 --> 00:37:25,586
- Ma'am, he's not Kim Dong Gu. - Kim Dong Gu!

574
00:37:25,587 --> 00:37:28,495
Please! Calm down, ma'am.

575
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,896
- Kim Dong Gu! - Get out of here, quick.

576
00:37:30,897 --> 00:37:33,336
- Please calm down. - You'll faint at this rate.

577
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:35,995
Kim Dong Gu!

578
00:37:35,996 --> 00:37:39,066
Where did you go? Kim Dong Gu!

579
00:37:39,067 --> 00:37:41,036
- Ma'am, calm down. - Please calm down.

She can't see well. She probably mistook you for someone else.

Her eyes...

585
00:38:30,826 --> 00:38:32,027
Because of what happened back then...

586
00:38:35,456 --> 00:38:36,496
Why?

587
00:38:38,427 --> 00:38:39,467
Why...

588
00:38:41,237 --> 00:38:43,366
She even lost her eyesight? Why...

589
00:39:04,927 --> 00:39:06,527
Ma'am, are you all right?

Please make sure she gets home safely.

We've got a problem, Soo Jae.

599
00:39:49,496 --> 00:39:51,536
There's been a collapse in Yeongpyeong District.

601
00:39:53,507 --> 00:39:55,436
is bawling right now!

602
00:39:59,306 --> 00:40:01,246
Go to the construction site. Once you get there...

603
00:40:03,047 --> 00:40:04,686
Why should I go there now?

604
00:40:05,147 --> 00:40:07,156
Go there and find out exactly what's going on.

605
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:08,455
What are you talking about?

606
00:40:08,456 --> 00:40:11,385
If this doesn't get sorted out, the sell-off will fall through.

607

I need you there.

608
00:40:12,857 --> 00:40:14,426
Hurry up and meet me there, okay?

609
00:40:14,427 --> 00:40:15,427

Hey. Can you make that accident in Yeongpyeong District...

613
00:40:35,177 --> 00:40:37,547
go away quickly?

614
00:40:38,116 --> 00:40:39,817
So it doesn't affect the sell-off.

615
00:40:39,886 --> 00:40:41,257
Yes, sir.

616
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,527
- I have to tell you something. - In Yeongpyeong District...

617
00:40:49,857 --> 00:40:52,127
No. Something urgent came up. I must get going now.

618
00:40:54,636 --> 00:40:57,107
I just need 5 minutes. No, 3 minutes.

I'm sorry. Let's talk at home.

00:41:11,947 --> 00:41:14,717
I heard. I'm on my way to the site.

Brief me while I drive.

623
00:41:22,056 --> 00:41:25,026
By developing the reclaimed land in Yeongpyeong District,

624
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:26,765
they planned to make a smart city of 8,000 houses...

625
00:41:26,766 --> 00:41:29,296
with bustling tourism by attracting a lot of funds from overseas.

626
00:41:29,297 --> 00:41:31,805
The construction kicked off with high hopes for everyone.

627
00:41:31,806 --> 00:41:33,706
But there has been a collapse at the construction site.

628
00:41:33,837 --> 00:41:34,935
I'm sorry, sir.

629
00:41:34,936 --> 00:41:37,506
Why are you telling me that now, you jerk!

630
00:41:37,507 --> 00:41:40,616
Someone died? How could you let that happen?

631
00:41:40,817 --> 00:41:43,915
I told you to pay attention to safety!

632
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:45,116
- I'm sorry, sir. - Come on.

633
00:41:46,116 --> 00:41:48,685
It's been confirmed that nine workers have been buried...

634
00:41:48,686 --> 00:41:51,825
with heavy equipment and other engineering equipment.

635
00:41:51,826 --> 00:41:54,225
How are you handling the press?

636
00:41:54,226 --> 00:41:56,296
A survivor was moved to a hospital.

637
00:41:56,297 --> 00:41:58,866
- As for the rest of the workers... - What are you doing?

638
00:41:59,197 --> 00:42:01,535
Send out a press release now...

639
00:42:01,536 --> 00:42:02,897
that I have nothing to do with Yeongpyeong District!

640
00:42:03,297 --> 00:42:06,106
What are you doing? Get a grip, you jerks!

00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,176
There's an obstruction that's difficult to remove.

When developing the reclaimed land,

643
00:42:09,737 --> 00:42:12,406
coal ash wastes were used to reclaim the mudflat,

644
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:14,817
so rescuing the workers won't be easy.

645
00:42:15,277 --> 00:42:18,015
They are doing everything they can...

646
00:42:18,016 --> 00:42:21,717
to locate the missing workers and rescue them.

647
00:42:23,217 --> 00:42:24,325
It was mentioned several times...

648
00:42:24,326 --> 00:42:25,856
that the underground water could have ruptured...

649
00:42:25,857 --> 00:42:27,697
when they began the construction.

650
00:42:27,726 --> 00:42:29,456
And there were several small sink holes too.

651
00:42:29,757 --> 00:42:31,297

Most of them are from subcontractors...

or sub-subcontractors.

as much equipment and resources as possible at the earliest.

was rescued after seven hours of the collapse...

"Yes, free samples."

And they give their address without questioning.

887
00:53:49,036 --> 00:53:52,845
And then they receive a huge box for their samples.

888
00:53:52,846 --> 00:53:54,745
So they sent the products with the samples.

889
00:53:54,746 --> 00:53:56,376
Why would they send the products?

890
00:53:56,377 --> 00:53:57,486
They pretend that it's a mistake.
