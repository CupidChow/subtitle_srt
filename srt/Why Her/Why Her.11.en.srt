What about you, sir? What brings you here?

It's cold. Here, cover yourself with this.

but I found out only after she'd died such a tragic death.

No.

Forget everything and put it all behind you now.

168
00:12:45,656 --> 00:12:48,386
Don't tell people that you were Kim Dong Gu.

169
00:12:49,225 --> 00:12:52,925
And if you ever fall in love with someone, do not tell her.

170
00:12:52,926 --> 00:12:54,126
Just move on and live like that.

171
00:12:54,495 --> 00:12:55,725
How can I do that?

172
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,095
How...

173
00:13:00,266 --> 00:13:01,465
How can I do that?

174
00:13:14,046 --> 00:13:16,445
Hey, we need to get out of here. Run!

175
00:13:54,056 --> 00:13:55,786
(Doctor's Note)

176
00:13:57,355 --> 00:14:00,695
I took care of everything so it'd appear as Mr. Han Dong O...

177
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:02,295
underwent treatment for panic disorder...

178
00:14:02,296 --> 00:14:04,724
and that the accident was caused by his medication's side effects,

179
00:14:04,725 --> 00:14:05,734
not by alcohol.

180
00:14:05,735 --> 00:14:07,364
(Jongno Police Station)

181
00:14:07,365 --> 00:14:09,406
They're coming out. There he is!

182
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,834
- Are you sure it wasn't a DUI case? - What caused the accident?

183
00:14:12,835 --> 00:14:14,305
Do you really suffer from panic disorder?

184
00:14:14,306 --> 00:14:15,604
- Tell us! - Just a comment, please!

185
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:18,516
I am sorry for causing you concern.

186
00:14:18,646 --> 00:14:21,215
- Do you admit that you're at fault? - Just a comment, please!

187
00:14:22,215 --> 00:14:23,445
I see.

188
00:14:23,786 --> 00:14:25,016
What about the skeleton?

189
00:14:25,286 --> 00:14:27,385
It'll take about a month for them to run the sample...

190
00:14:27,386 --> 00:14:29,585
through the National Police Agency's DNA database.

191
00:14:30,225 --> 00:14:32,026
I'll be sure to get it sorted out until then,

192
00:14:32,095 --> 00:14:34,725
as quietly and quickly as possible.

193
00:14:34,825 --> 00:14:38,436
Oh, dear. I've seen...

194
00:14:38,865 --> 00:14:40,964
coffins and bones...

195
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:42,865
turning up at numerous construction sites.

196
00:14:44,235 --> 00:14:46,276
But this time, it was in a gunnysack.

197
00:14:46,605 --> 00:14:47,936
It really creeps me out.

198
00:14:47,975 --> 00:14:49,905
I already told the Police Commissioner.

199
00:14:49,906 --> 00:14:51,646
Chief Kang will take care of it.

200
00:14:55,945 --> 00:14:57,585
All right, thanks.

201
00:15:00,156 --> 00:15:02,926
Gosh, the gunnysack. Oh, boy.

202
00:15:05,455 --> 00:15:06,625
- Hi. - My gosh.

203
00:15:06,626 --> 00:15:08,595
I know how busy you are. Thank you for coming.

204
00:15:11,426 --> 00:15:12,666
Please take a seat.

205
00:15:14,766 --> 00:15:17,405
Every time there's an election, the power of Myungmoon Daily...

206
00:15:17,406 --> 00:15:19,105
influences the decisions of voters.

207
00:15:20,676 --> 00:15:22,704
And the citizens who have nothing to rely on...

208
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:25,475
firmly trust Seoul Research's opinion polls.

209
00:15:25,615 --> 00:15:29,646
The power of Myungmoon can get the President impeached...

210
00:15:29,886 --> 00:15:31,855
and get a new President elected as well.

211
00:15:33,156 --> 00:15:34,685
So you're saying...

212
00:15:34,686 --> 00:15:37,355
Mr. Lee In Soo aims to only serve two years once elected.

213
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:40,255
A parliamentary system will be installed...

214
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:41,495
immediately after the 2024 general election.

215
00:15:42,026 --> 00:15:44,695
Then the Prime Minister will handle all the governmental affairs.

216
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,166
It's a sensational idea.

217
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:49,705
I'm sure Mr. Lee's ratings will soar.

218
00:15:52,136 --> 00:15:54,936
I must say, you're incredibly clever.

219
00:15:57,176 --> 00:15:58,245

Hey, your face...

223
00:17:18,025 --> 00:17:20,596
- I... - I'll go first.

224
00:17:23,096 --> 00:17:24,926
I don't want to hear anything.

225
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,566
Until I tell you that you can talk to me,

226
00:17:31,975 --> 00:17:33,805
don't you say a thing to me.

227
00:17:35,406 --> 00:17:36,475
She knows.

228
00:17:38,646 --> 00:17:39,775
Don't say anything.

229
00:17:47,015 --> 00:17:48,255
And here.

230
00:17:56,096 --> 00:17:57,265
I'm returning it to you.

231
00:17:59,896 --> 00:18:01,035
But why...

232
00:18:23,626 --> 00:18:24,826
She knows...

233
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:27,396
who I am.

234
00:18:49,945 --> 00:18:52,416
Had I told her from the get-go that I was Kim Dong Gu,

235
00:18:53,686 --> 00:18:54,985
what would've happened?

236
00:19:09,336 --> 00:19:11,836
Sir.

237
00:19:14,176 --> 00:19:17,045
Yes. Are we there already?

238
00:19:18,876 --> 00:19:20,816
I'd like to talk to you about something.

239
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,285
What are you talking about?

240
00:19:30,156 --> 00:19:31,426
What a mess.

241
00:19:32,295 --> 00:19:34,255
Are you kidding me right now?

242
00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:35,794
My apologies, sir.

243
00:19:35,795 --> 00:19:38,195
- Hey, what are you doing? - You take care of it. You got that?

244
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:40,366
Why are you eavesdropping like a rat?

245
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,406
I was just wondering why Father was smashing things.

246
00:19:47,876 --> 00:19:48,975
That punk...

247
00:19:55,515 --> 00:19:56,785

251
00:20:21,035 --> 00:20:22,576
Here.

252
00:20:24,945 --> 00:20:28,346
Where did Chan go so early?

253
00:20:28,886 --> 00:20:30,985
I didn't see him leave the house.

254

Professor Oh, it looked like you got home late last night.

255

Were you busy yesterday?

256

Thank you for this. But my stomach is upset, so I can't eat now.

Hey, I'm getting a bad feeling.

259
00:21:01,215 --> 00:21:03,146
I bet she saw all those things in the rooftop room.

260
00:21:04,745 --> 00:21:07,215
Anyway, when did Chan get home and go out again?

I don't know.

I didn't even know that he came home.

263
00:21:11,586 --> 00:21:14,095
- Should I try calling him? - He's not picking up.

264
00:21:14,096 --> 00:21:15,525
I already called him ten times.

265

Gosh. That poor thing.

266
00:21:19,396 --> 00:21:21,166

00:21:45,826 --> 00:21:48,495
What? Did you miss me?

272

Gosh. You didn't believe me...

274
00:21:54,465 --> 00:21:57,305
and insisted that I didn't kill her.

275

Yes.

277
00:22:02,176 --> 00:22:03,575
You did kill her.

00:22:03,576 --> 00:22:04,846
Too bad.

00:22:12,856 --> 00:22:15,316
What? Does that infuriate you?

281
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:17,626
I bet you want to kill me.

282
00:22:18,856 --> 00:22:21,626
Hey, there's no point fighting me.

283
00:22:22,525 --> 00:22:25,225
The government is going to forgive me.

284
00:22:25,896 --> 00:22:28,366
Our dear government will.

285
00:22:31,265 --> 00:22:32,876
Why did you kill my sister?

286
00:22:36,775 --> 00:22:37,876
Just because...

287
00:22:38,745 --> 00:22:40,275
Just because I was bored.

288
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:47,656
Why did you dump her body...

289
00:22:49,025 --> 00:22:50,186
in the ocean?

290
00:22:51,755 --> 00:22:53,555
You see, when you dump bodies,

291
00:22:54,455 --> 00:22:56,326
the ocean is the perfect place.

292
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:59,136
And the ocean I chose...

293
00:22:59,265 --> 00:23:01,035
had crazy tidal currents.

294
00:23:01,765 --> 00:23:04,505
The currents will take the body far away from the shores.

295
00:23:05,005 --> 00:23:06,336
When you dump bodies into the ocean,

296
00:23:06,406 --> 00:23:08,606
you don't have to hang heavy stuff on them...

297
00:23:08,705 --> 00:23:10,545
or put them in bags.

298
00:23:10,646 --> 00:23:11,805
So...

299
00:23:13,245 --> 00:23:15,076
did you just dump my sister in the ocean?

300
00:23:17,086 --> 00:23:18,586
You didn't hang stuff on her...

301
00:23:19,285 --> 00:23:21,086
or put her in a bag. You just threw her away?

302
00:23:22,426 --> 00:23:23,725
Of course.

303
00:23:25,055 --> 00:23:28,455
The ocean was going to push her away and get rid of her on its own.

304
00:23:38,235 --> 00:23:39,576
I knew it. You didn't do it.

305
00:23:45,775 --> 00:23:47,346
I hope you do come out on parole.

306

Thank you.

315
00:24:20,275 --> 00:24:21,545
Ms. Ji is looking for you.

316
00:24:21,745 --> 00:24:23,285
She wants to apologize for what she did before.

317
00:24:24,945 --> 00:24:28,014
Ms. Ji, Chan is on his way right now.

318
00:24:28,015 --> 00:24:29,285
You just have to wait a bit.

319
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,785
Hurry. Okay?

320
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:34,024
- This is good. - It's delicious.

321
00:24:34,025 --> 00:24:37,095
By the way, the police suddenly want to help us.

322
00:24:37,096 --> 00:24:38,565
How can they change so quickly?

323
00:24:38,566 --> 00:24:42,435
Oh, that? We have a lawyer named Ms. Song Mi Rim.

324
00:24:42,436 --> 00:24:44,336
She really worked hard for your case.

325
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:46,336
Seriously. She's the best.

326
00:24:47,275 --> 00:24:50,576
So will the CEO of the cosmetic company return your money?

327
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,146
That's the most important point.

328
00:24:52,305 --> 00:24:55,616
The police promised they will get our money back.

329
00:24:55,676 --> 00:24:57,345
They will make that their first priority.

330
00:24:57,346 --> 00:24:58,985
That's great to hear.

331
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:00,916
It's not much.

332
00:25:02,656 --> 00:25:05,925
- But we made these socks at work. - Goodness.

333
00:25:05,926 --> 00:25:09,224
- Oh, my. - I brought them for you guys.

334
00:25:09,225 --> 00:25:10,525
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

335
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:15,395
And I really want to apologize to that student too.

336
00:25:15,396 --> 00:25:17,535
I feel awful. And I'm grateful at the same time.

337
00:25:18,735 --> 00:25:20,975
Chan is coming. Don't worry.

338
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,445
Okay.

339
00:25:25,606 --> 00:25:28,115
Soo Jae, this is a big mess.

340
00:25:28,116 --> 00:25:29,984
The bereaved families and families of injured workers...

341
00:25:29,985 --> 00:25:32,415
are writing posts on social media and doing interviews with reporters.

342
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,485
They are even doing a protest outside the hospital.

343
00:25:34,856 --> 00:25:37,555
Where are you? You need to come over here now.

344
00:25:37,686 --> 00:25:39,156
I'm almost there. I'm hanging up.

345
00:25:50,235 --> 00:25:51,535
(Seojung University Hospital)

346
00:25:51,735 --> 00:25:53,705
- Bring them back! - Bring them back!

347
00:25:53,805 --> 00:25:56,845
Murderer Han Sung Bum must apologize!

348
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:58,876
- Apologize! - Apologize!

349
00:25:59,376 --> 00:26:00,376
He's the representative...

350
00:26:00,377 --> 00:26:03,145
- of the victims. - Bring back my family!

351
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:05,145
- Bring them back! - Bring them back!

352
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,086
(Murderer Han Sung Bum must apologize immediately!)

353
00:26:18,025 --> 00:26:19,136
What are you doing here?

354
00:26:19,336 --> 00:26:22,535
The chairman instructed me to assist you.

355
00:26:22,836 --> 00:26:25,005
That's my role as the intern of TK Law Firm.

356
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:27,376
What about school? Shouldn't you be studying?

357
00:26:27,475 --> 00:26:29,274
Thanks to the internship certificate,

358
00:26:29,275 --> 00:26:32,775
I can replace my attendance with reports. So I'll be fine.

359
00:26:40,816 --> 00:26:43,426
(Condolences to the victims from the collapse)

360
00:26:43,586 --> 00:26:45,126
(Im Chul Ho, Kim Gil Su, Park Eui)

361
00:26:52,326 --> 00:26:54,435
- Get out. - You need to get out.

362
00:26:54,436 --> 00:26:56,665
- Get out of here. - How dare you show up here?

363
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:58,635
- Get out! - Get out!

364
00:26:58,636 --> 00:27:01,075
You didn't even show up for the past two days.

365
00:27:01,076 --> 00:27:03,845
You want to put on an act now? Get out of here!

366
00:27:03,846 --> 00:27:06,015
- Get out of here now. - Get out!

367
00:27:06,116 --> 00:27:08,445
I'm Oh Soo Jae. I represent Hansu Construction.

368
00:27:09,745 --> 00:27:13,515
We reached out to meet with you, but you turned it down.

369
00:27:13,856 --> 00:27:16,356
But I believed it would be unethical to put it off any longer.

370
00:27:16,686 --> 00:27:19,254
I wanted to talk to the families, so I decided to come here.

371
00:27:19,255 --> 00:27:21,626
"Unethical"? "Talk to the families"?

372
00:27:21,926 --> 00:27:25,295
After the company killed them and caused injuries. Seriously?

373
00:27:25,396 --> 00:27:27,234
And the company put them in a coma!

374
00:27:27,235 --> 00:27:29,234
- Get out. - We don't need to talk to you!

375
00:27:29,235 --> 00:27:30,764
- Get out. - Sir!

376
00:27:30,765 --> 00:27:32,435
Don't use violence. We should calmly talk this out.

377
00:27:32,436 --> 00:27:33,635
- Who are you? - Who are you?

378
00:27:33,636 --> 00:27:36,175
Who do you think you are, telling us what to do?

379
00:27:36,176 --> 00:27:37,774
You should at least show some manners!

380
00:27:37,775 --> 00:27:38,876
Choi Yoon Sang!

381
00:27:40,745 --> 00:27:42,015
Hello, sir.

382
00:27:59,495 --> 00:28:02,765
(Condolences to the victims from the collapse)

383
00:28:07,376 --> 00:28:09,244
I can't imagine the pain of your loss.

384
00:28:09,245 --> 00:28:11,076
Sir. They are the families.

385
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,715
I can't imagine the pain of your loss.

386
00:28:17,945 --> 00:28:20,686
We will wait until your pain subsides.

387
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:24,755
We will try our best to bring you comfort...

388
00:28:25,326 --> 00:28:27,396
in any way we can.

389
00:28:27,596 --> 00:28:29,426
- Hey! - I'm sorry.

390
00:28:29,695 --> 00:28:31,965
Hey. You.

391
00:28:32,195 --> 00:28:33,895
- What are you doing? - Hey.

392
00:28:33,896 --> 00:28:36,335
- What are you doing? - What are you doing?

393
00:28:36,336 --> 00:28:39,375
- You! - What do you think you're doing?

394
00:28:39,376 --> 00:28:41,504
- What is this? - Bring him back!

395
00:28:41,505 --> 00:28:43,405
- What's going on? - Stop that.

396
00:28:43,406 --> 00:28:45,145
- What are you doing? - Get your hands off him.

397
00:28:45,146 --> 00:28:46,846
- Goodness. - Oh, my.

398
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:49,685
- Stop that! - What is she doing?

399
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,685
- Please calm down. - What are you doing?

400
00:28:51,686 --> 00:28:53,454
- Sir! - What are you doing?

401
00:28:53,455 --> 00:28:55,615
- I told you to let go of him. - Get your hands off him.

402
00:28:55,616 --> 00:28:58,155
- Stop that. - Hey, that hurts!

403
00:28:58,156 --> 00:29:00,454
- Please stop it. - Get your hands off him.

404
00:29:00,455 --> 00:29:03,465
- Get off him! - Hey, calm down.

405
00:29:13,876 --> 00:29:15,336
What are you doing?

406
00:29:15,436 --> 00:29:16,945
Soo Jae, they were being rude...

407
00:29:18,346 --> 00:29:20,274
They crossed the line, Ms. Oh.

408
00:29:20,275 --> 00:29:22,715
You think Mi Rim didn't do anything because she didn't see that?

409
00:29:24,316 --> 00:29:25,645
It's a rule...

410
00:29:25,646 --> 00:29:28,086
that you don't try to protect her in a situation like that.

411
00:29:28,386 --> 00:29:29,985
I thought you would get hurt.

412
00:29:31,326 --> 00:29:32,695
That's why I did it.

413
00:29:34,995 --> 00:29:36,325
Go to the police station...

414
00:29:36,326 --> 00:29:38,965
and check how the investigation is going in Yeongpyeong District.

415
00:29:40,735 --> 00:29:42,166
And take this fool with you.

416
00:30:04,755 --> 00:30:06,895
Yes. It was delicious.

417
00:30:06,896 --> 00:30:09,255
- Really? - Yes. Thank you.

418
00:30:10,326 --> 00:30:12,566
Thank you for enjoying them.

419
00:30:12,965 --> 00:30:15,636
- Kang Ja. - Hey, Chan.

420
00:30:16,035 --> 00:30:18,005
Ma'am, Chan is here.

421
00:30:18,106 --> 00:30:20,005
I see. Chan.

422
00:30:20,475 --> 00:30:23,846
I mistook your voice for someone else's voice before.

423
00:30:24,076 --> 00:30:25,475
I'm sorry about that.

424
00:30:27,676 --> 00:30:30,415
Kang Ja, I want to talk to her.

425
00:30:30,416 --> 00:30:31,515
Sure.

426
00:30:31,886 --> 00:30:33,285
- Bye. - Bye.

427
00:30:34,755 --> 00:30:36,155
I'm sorry once again.

428
00:30:36,156 --> 00:30:38,125
When I hear a similar voice,

429
00:30:38,126 --> 00:30:39,655
I often mistake them for someone else.

430
00:30:39,656 --> 00:30:41,656
I often get that wrong.

431
00:30:46,025 --> 00:30:47,136
Ms. Ji.

432
00:30:53,205 --> 00:30:55,906
I think they found Na Jung.

433
00:30:57,945 --> 00:30:59,646
Na Jung's skeleton was found.

434
00:31:00,215 --> 00:31:01,616
Come to the police station with me.

435
00:31:02,515 --> 00:31:05,146
The skeleton?

436
00:31:08,515 --> 00:31:09,826
What do you mean?

437
00:31:11,326 --> 00:31:14,555
Let's go to the police station. You have to get tested.

438
00:31:15,225 --> 00:31:16,426
What's wrong with you?

439
00:31:17,866 --> 00:31:20,366
You're not Kim Dong Gu.

440
00:31:22,495 --> 00:31:24,636
You're not Kim Dong Gu.

441
00:31:27,705 --> 00:31:29,406
I'm Kim Dong Gu, Ms. Ji.

442
00:31:31,376 --> 00:31:32,406
I'm...

443
00:31:33,945 --> 00:31:35,215
Kim Dong Gu.

444
00:31:35,376 --> 00:31:36,515
No.

445
00:31:40,156 --> 00:31:42,116
My daughter is alive.

446
00:31:44,455 --> 00:31:47,325
- No. - Ma'am.

447
00:31:47,326 --> 00:31:49,764
- Ma'am. - That's not her.

448
00:31:49,765 --> 00:31:51,326
- No! - What's going on?

449
00:31:51,465 --> 00:31:53,635
- My gosh. - It's not her!

450
00:31:53,636 --> 00:31:56,735
My daughter is alive!

451
00:32:00,205 --> 00:32:02,804
No, it's not her!

452
00:32:02,805 --> 00:32:04,146
- No! - Please calm down.

453
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:09,745
- Ma'am. - She's alive!

454
00:32:53,826 --> 00:32:55,426
Maybe Ms. Ji Soon Ok...

455
00:32:55,955 --> 00:32:58,926
is mentally unstable.

456
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:01,165
She said that she wanted to apologize to Chan,

457
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:02,535
but she lashed out at him again.

458
00:33:03,906 --> 00:33:06,735
I know. She loses her wits every time she meets Chan.

459
00:33:09,676 --> 00:33:11,245
I'm Kim Dong Gu, Ms. Ji.

460
00:33:12,846 --> 00:33:13,916
I'm...

461
00:33:15,146 --> 00:33:16,445
Kim Dong Gu.

462
00:33:17,215 --> 00:33:19,346
What if Chan is Kim Dong Gu?

463
00:33:20,255 --> 00:33:22,755
- What? - That's an implausible hypothesis.

464
00:33:23,426 --> 00:33:25,326
"What if Na Se Ryeon is Cho Kang Ja?"

465
00:33:25,626 --> 00:33:27,055
Isn't it just like that?

466
00:33:27,656 --> 00:33:29,294
It makes no sense.

467
00:33:29,295 --> 00:33:30,566
No, it could make sense.

468
00:33:30,826 --> 00:33:33,366
It's possible that Kim Dong Gu changed his name to Gong Chan.

469
00:33:34,066 --> 00:33:35,136
He changed his name?

470
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:26,855
Chairman Han Sung Bum of Hansu Group was attacked...

471
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,856
by the bereaved families of the collapse victims...

472
00:34:28,986 --> 00:34:31,154
at the group memorial altar in Yeongpyeong District.

473
00:34:31,155 --> 00:34:32,225
He is hospitalized at the moment.

474
00:34:32,325 --> 00:34:34,824
The bereaved got riled up and suddenly attacked him.

475
00:34:34,825 --> 00:34:36,525
He is recovering from the shock...

476
00:34:36,526 --> 00:34:37,626
and is undergoing an in-depth examination.

477
00:34:37,925 --> 00:34:40,365
The bereaved grabbed Chairman Han by the collar and...

478
00:34:41,595 --> 00:34:44,034
I apologize, sir. I should have protected you.

479
00:34:44,035 --> 00:34:45,565
Because of my herniated disk in the neck...

480
00:34:45,566 --> 00:34:46,776
I'm sorry, sir.

481
00:34:47,035 --> 00:34:50,745
I didn't think those people would be so aggressive.

482
00:34:55,515 --> 00:34:57,046
You fools.

483
00:34:57,446 --> 00:34:58,945
I went there...

484
00:34:58,946 --> 00:35:01,785
hoping someone would grab me by the collar.

485
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:06,555
And that woman did just that, you know?

486
00:35:08,026 --> 00:35:09,425
Ms. Oh, you never let me down.

487
00:35:10,466 --> 00:35:13,066
You sure can paint the big picture. You rock.

488
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:15,094
Awesome, Soo Jae!

489
00:35:15,095 --> 00:35:18,364
Both you and Hansu Construction could win some pity points...

490
00:35:18,365 --> 00:35:20,006
because of today's incident in the short term.

491
00:35:20,236 --> 00:35:22,875
But the moment you decline the bereaved families' requests,

492
00:35:22,876 --> 00:35:24,146
it'll all backfire on you.

493
00:35:24,446 --> 00:35:26,716
Of course, it'll negatively affect the sell-off of Hansu Bio.

494
00:35:27,675 --> 00:35:29,375
"Hansu Group feels responsible for the incident."

495
00:35:29,376 --> 00:35:31,045
"Maximum compensation is guaranteed."

496
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:34,055
These are the key points. I'll wrap it up like that.

497
00:35:34,155 --> 00:35:37,486
Sure, I don't care how much we spend to compensate them.

498
00:35:37,555 --> 00:35:40,696
Give them what they want and shut them up.

499
00:35:42,825 --> 00:35:43,825
Sorry.

500
00:35:45,425 --> 00:35:46,436
- It's Chairman Choi. - Yes, sir.

501
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:53,905
Hi, Chairman Choi. Yes.

502
00:35:55,675 --> 00:35:56,876
Did you watch the news?

503
00:35:57,106 --> 00:35:58,904
(Agreement)

504
00:35:58,905 --> 00:36:02,575
They want me to sign this and keep my mouth shut, right?

505
00:36:03,186 --> 00:36:05,745
Read it over first. The terms are pretty good.

506
00:36:06,086 --> 00:36:08,615
The others have already signed it.

507
00:36:09,555 --> 00:36:10,756
I won't sign it.

508
00:36:10,885 --> 00:36:12,454
Just for this chump change...

509
00:36:12,455 --> 00:36:15,825
My son is still in a coma. How could I read this?

510
00:36:16,126 --> 00:36:18,165
(Agreement)

511
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:20,936
Read it. Look at the amount.

512
00:36:21,635 --> 00:36:23,265
(Compensation of 300,000 dollars)

513
00:36:23,405 --> 00:36:25,966
Can you still call it "chump change"?

514
00:36:27,336 --> 00:36:30,605
You'd never touch this kind of money even if you worked your whole life.

515
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:31,705
Hey!

516
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:34,946
Your son, Oh Pil Seung,

517
00:36:35,475 --> 00:36:37,515
ate and slept at the construction site to work there.

518
00:36:37,845 --> 00:36:40,155
He practically lived there to get the overtime pay.

519
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:43,626
The best thing you can do for your son right now...

520
00:36:43,756 --> 00:36:46,225
is to accept this money and get through this.

521
00:36:48,595 --> 00:36:50,495
Sign the agreement and accept the money.

522
00:36:51,696 --> 00:36:53,995
It was the maximum amount I could get for you.

523
00:36:56,606 --> 00:36:58,135
I really hate this.

524
00:36:59,305 --> 00:37:00,905
I hate this so much.

525
00:37:02,936 --> 00:37:06,376
Money disgusts me.

526
00:37:07,276 --> 00:37:08,776
You must accept it even if it disgusts you.

527
00:37:09,816 --> 00:37:11,216
Take the money even if you hate it.

528
00:37:13,385 --> 00:37:15,316
You went through so much while raising your son alone.

529
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:20,626
How did you know?

530
00:37:21,995 --> 00:37:23,966
Oh Soo Jung's son, Oh Pil Seung.

531
00:37:26,595 --> 00:37:27,966
It's a good name.

532
00:37:29,336 --> 00:37:30,405
It's very cool.

533
00:37:38,345 --> 00:37:39,376
Gosh...

534
00:37:46,655 --> 00:37:48,186
My dear Pil Seung...

535
00:37:49,256 --> 00:37:51,155
He will wake up, right?

536
00:37:54,325 --> 00:37:55,425
Of course, he will.

537
00:37:56,095 --> 00:37:59,225
His mom, who grabbed Chairman Han by the collar, is waiting for him.

538
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:01,466
He has to wake up.

539
00:38:02,736 --> 00:38:05,305
I can't stand you, Oh Annoying.

Get in the car, Soo Jae.

546
00:39:16,675 --> 00:39:19,175
Together for Our Future's presidential candidate, Lee In Soo,

547
00:39:19,305 --> 00:39:21,646
has announced his pledge to switch to a parliamentary system.

548
00:39:21,975 --> 00:39:25,046
Assemblyman Lee In Soo and the Together for Our Future Party...

549
00:39:25,385 --> 00:39:27,086
wish to install a parliamentary system...

550
00:39:27,186 --> 00:39:29,115
after his two-year term once elected.

551
00:39:29,216 --> 00:39:31,884
He will push for constitutional reform once he takes office...

552
00:39:31,885 --> 00:39:33,324
to redistribute the enormous power...

553
00:39:33,325 --> 00:39:35,126
concentrated in the office of the President.

554
00:39:35,396 --> 00:39:37,864
The opinion polls revealed that his approval rating...

555
00:39:37,865 --> 00:39:40,435
which had plateaued suddenly rose over eight percent points.

556
00:39:40,436 --> 00:39:41,864
It seems that his unconventional pledge...

557
00:39:41,865 --> 00:39:44,364
has made him the most likely winner.

558
00:39:44,365 --> 00:39:46,436
Yes, Assemblyman Lee. Congratulations.

559
00:39:46,506 --> 00:39:48,836
Your rating finally snapped out of the limbo and...

560
00:39:51,205 --> 00:39:53,975
I had to keep it confidential due to its unconventional nature.

561
00:39:54,216 --> 00:39:56,114
I told you...

562
00:39:56,115 --> 00:39:57,985
that I'd make you the next President no matter what.

563
00:39:57,986 --> 00:39:59,316
Look, Chairman Choi.

564
00:39:59,646 --> 00:40:02,586
This is your plan, not mine.

565
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:05,586
My pledge I didn't even know about has been announced.

566
00:40:06,325 --> 00:40:08,126
And immediately following that,

567
00:40:08,856 --> 00:40:11,865
opinion poll results have also been announced.

568
00:40:12,666 --> 00:40:14,135
Look, Chairman Choi.

569
00:40:14,436 --> 00:40:16,836
You really are crossing the line here, don't you think?

570
00:40:17,336 --> 00:40:19,836
Do you think I gave you all the power...

571
00:40:20,175 --> 00:40:22,175
and supported the Yeongpyeong District project...

572
00:40:22,635 --> 00:40:25,305
just so I could serve two years as President?

573
00:40:25,475 --> 00:40:27,876
Right. Due to the incident in Yeongpyeong District,

574
00:40:28,615 --> 00:40:31,115
the police have launched an investigation.

575
00:40:32,015 --> 00:40:34,686
However, the dividend your family will receive...

576
00:40:34,785 --> 00:40:37,925
will be kept strictly confidential, so you can put your worries to rest.

577
00:40:38,825 --> 00:40:40,296
Listen, Chairman Choi.

578
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:43,865
If Chairman Han finds out about this, he will...

579
00:40:48,265 --> 00:40:49,365
What do you mean?

580
00:40:51,966 --> 00:40:53,135
So you're saying...

581
00:40:54,006 --> 00:40:57,705
Chairman Han knew about it too? Is that it?

582
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:01,475
Sir, you should get going now.

583
00:41:02,015 --> 00:41:03,986
Your rating will continue to rise...

584
00:41:04,515 --> 00:41:06,646
because I've got your back.

585
00:41:08,055 --> 00:41:09,416

After all, you want Assemblyman Lee to become President...

597
00:41:44,785 --> 00:41:47,126
for your own gain.

598
00:41:47,696 --> 00:41:49,756
That's right. You know,

599
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:53,325
nothing I've done was for his sake.

600
00:41:54,035 --> 00:41:55,436
It was all for my own benefit.

601
00:41:56,066 --> 00:41:57,966
And now, you have Chairman Han's support too.

602

I suppose you'll realize your grand dreams at last.

Putting my needs before yours...

607
00:42:18,186 --> 00:42:19,986
will be the best thing you can do for yourself.

608
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,425
So I suggest you become my person.

609
00:42:23,055 --> 00:42:25,526
There are a lot of things I can do for you.

610

You can count on that.

611
00:42:59,296 --> 00:43:00,865
Let me be very clear.

612
00:43:01,836 --> 00:43:05,436
Unfortunately, I have no respect for your son.

613
00:43:06,905 --> 00:43:11,376
And just like you, I had never done something for someone else's gain.

I only do things for myself.

to the DNA of the hair?

623

- His sister? - Is she your sister or not?

He said there was a scene when Ms. Ji visited.

650

651

that he was Kim Dong Gu.

652
00:46:41,356 --> 00:46:43,285
Ms. Ji was upset when he told her that.

653
00:46:43,385 --> 00:46:46,755
She said he wasn't Kim Dong Gu and Na Jung wasn't dead.

654

That's what she said when she left.

655
00:46:48,425 --> 00:46:50,865
So at first, I didn't understand this either.

But at the police station, Chan told the detective...

657
00:46:54,535 --> 00:46:56,594
that the skeleton in Yeongpyeong District...

658
00:46:56,595 --> 00:46:58,506
was his sister, Jeon Na Jung.

659
00:47:10,216 --> 00:47:11,946
There is something I haven't told you yet either.

660
00:47:13,785 --> 00:47:17,325
I don't want you to find out, but I have to tell you.

661
00:47:18,455 --> 00:47:20,285
I know that I have to tell you,

662
00:47:21,256 --> 00:47:22,896
but I still hesitate to tell you.

663
00:47:24,265 --> 00:47:25,825
I will tell you everything.

664
00:47:28,265 --> 00:47:29,896
And you will hate me for sure.

665
00:47:30,865 --> 00:47:32,336
Even if you do, stay by my side.

666
00:47:33,635 --> 00:47:35,236
You can hate me.

667
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:37,805
So don't go anywhere else.

668

(Professor Oh Soo Jae)

669
00:48:12,575 --> 00:48:13,606
Yes.

670
00:48:25,785 --> 00:48:28,055
I'm here. I'll cross over to you.

671
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,455
You can listen to me there.

672
00:48:33,325 --> 00:48:34,836
I heard from Mi Rim.

673
00:48:35,236 --> 00:48:37,405
The skeleton that was found in Yeongpyeong District...

674
00:48:38,006 --> 00:48:39,836
Do you think that's Jeon Na Jung's skeleton?

675
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:42,635
I want to apologize...

676
00:48:44,805 --> 00:48:46,376
for not telling you sooner...

677
00:48:47,646 --> 00:48:49,216
that I was Kim Dong Gu.

678
00:48:51,046 --> 00:48:52,745
I should have told you,

679
00:48:54,385 --> 00:48:56,155
but I liked that you didn't recognize me...

680
00:48:57,425 --> 00:48:58,955
because you treated me as Gong Chan,

681
00:49:00,155 --> 00:49:01,455
not Kim Dong Gu.

682
00:49:02,796 --> 00:49:04,796
I was happy that you treated me as Gong Chan.

683
00:49:05,825 --> 00:49:08,095
What makes you think the skeleton is Jeon Na Jung?

684
00:49:09,396 --> 00:49:12,336
How much does Ms. Ji know about this?

685
00:49:13,365 --> 00:49:16,535
You're not going to listen to me?

686
00:49:18,946 --> 00:49:20,916
How would it have been if I had told you from the get-go?

687
00:49:21,916 --> 00:49:23,885
I regret it, and I feel awful about what I did.

688
00:49:25,486 --> 00:49:27,416
But I wasn't trying to deceive you.

689
00:49:27,686 --> 00:49:29,686
- I wasn't deceiving you. - You were.

690
00:49:31,285 --> 00:49:32,385
You...

691
00:49:34,055 --> 00:49:35,856
deceived me, Kim Dong Gu.

692
00:49:42,995 --> 00:49:45,106
If you think the skeleton is your sister,

693
00:49:45,765 --> 00:49:47,836
bring Ms. Ji to the police station as soon as possible.

694
00:49:49,006 --> 00:49:51,245
If that's difficult, report that to the police.

695
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:53,646
Don't let your impatience show in your action.

696
00:49:55,716 --> 00:49:57,285
The incident from ten years ago.

697
00:49:58,316 --> 00:49:59,986
I can't compare my experience to yours.

698
00:50:01,015 --> 00:50:02,716
But it's a case I want to forget too.

699
00:50:03,785 --> 00:50:06,655
A case you want to forget?

700
00:50:06,825 --> 00:50:09,095
It was the most humiliating loss...

701
00:50:09,155 --> 00:50:11,595
in my entire career as a lawyer.

702
00:50:11,796 --> 00:50:13,796
You believed that I wasn't the culprit.

703
00:50:15,035 --> 00:50:17,736
That's why you argued for my innocence. We lost the trial,

704
00:50:19,865 --> 00:50:22,106
but it was revealed that I was innocent later.

705
00:50:22,736 --> 00:50:23,776
You think...

706
00:50:25,046 --> 00:50:27,615
the culprit in prison isn't the real culprit.

707
00:50:29,515 --> 00:50:31,245
What's the point of changing your name?

708
00:50:31,586 --> 00:50:34,615
You're still stuck in the case from ten years ago.

709
00:50:35,285 --> 00:50:37,256
And you're deceiving everyone around you.

710
00:50:38,586 --> 00:50:42,155
On top of that, you don't think No Byung Chul is the real culprit.

711
00:50:44,225 --> 00:50:47,436
No Byung Chul isn't the real culprit.

712
00:50:47,666 --> 00:50:48,966
On what grounds?

713
00:50:50,066 --> 00:50:53,365
Do you have evidence? Is your evidence solid?

714
00:50:53,535 --> 00:50:55,936
I heard it. I know what I heard...

715
00:50:56,106 --> 00:50:57,276
about No Byung Chul.

716
00:50:58,705 --> 00:51:01,145
- That's not evidence. - But...

717
00:51:01,146 --> 00:51:03,245
You changed even your name to get a fresh start.

718
00:51:03,446 --> 00:51:05,285
Then free yourself from the case.

719
00:51:07,615 --> 00:51:09,586
But you are still in that swamp.

720
00:51:10,626 --> 00:51:12,686
Had I known you were Kim Dong Gu,

721
00:51:15,555 --> 00:51:18,126
I wouldn't have been mistaken to believe that I liked you.

722
00:51:19,696 --> 00:51:21,936
- Mistaken? - Yes.

723
00:51:24,236 --> 00:51:25,765
I was briefly mistaken...

724
00:51:27,705 --> 00:51:29,905
to believe I liked someone I didn't know at all.

725
00:51:33,405 --> 00:51:35,515
So it turned out it was nothing.

726
00:51:36,716 --> 00:51:37,946
Wait.

727
00:51:43,385 --> 00:51:47,256
I wanted to live my life as a decent person.

728
00:51:48,256 --> 00:51:49,856
I was acquitted.

729
00:51:51,765 --> 00:51:53,296
But people still pointed fingers at me.

730
00:51:55,166 --> 00:51:58,805
I didn't want my past following me for the rest of my life.

731
00:52:03,175 --> 00:52:04,845
So I changed my name.

732
00:52:07,175 --> 00:52:08,276
You're right.

733
00:52:09,546 --> 00:52:13,285
Had I told you that I was Kim Dong Gu,

734
00:52:16,055 --> 00:52:17,955
we wouldn't have come this far.

735
00:52:20,455 --> 00:52:21,756
That's true.

736
00:52:23,425 --> 00:52:24,526
See?

737
00:52:26,466 --> 00:52:28,066
This is what it means...

738
00:52:29,265 --> 00:52:30,535
to live as Kim Dong Gu.

739
00:52:31,836 --> 00:52:33,705
Having feelings for you...

740
00:52:34,436 --> 00:52:36,106
is allowed for Gong Chan.

741
00:52:37,205 --> 00:52:40,546
But not for Kim Dong Gu. That's what it means to be him.

742
00:52:42,716 --> 00:52:44,416
So I didn't want to tell you.

743
00:52:45,285 --> 00:52:46,844
I wanted to tell you at the last possible moment.

744
00:52:46,845 --> 00:52:48,756
If I could, I wanted to keep it from you.

745
00:52:52,256 --> 00:52:53,856
Not telling you the whole story...

746
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:57,425
made me feel...

747
00:53:03,765 --> 00:53:05,405
guilty from time to time.

748
00:53:11,876 --> 00:53:13,205
But not anymore.

749
00:53:14,745 --> 00:53:16,876
You just proved my point.

750
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,515
Right.

751
00:53:22,015 --> 00:53:23,455
I told you...

752
00:53:25,655 --> 00:53:27,825
that you would hate me at some point.

753
00:53:28,555 --> 00:53:30,425
- And I asked you not to... - No.

754
00:53:35,865 --> 00:53:37,196
Stop.

755
00:53:41,106 --> 00:53:42,376
Stop here.

756
00:53:43,506 --> 00:53:44,805
Don't get close.

So it turned out it was nothing.

774
00:55:32,216 --> 00:55:34,256
When I woke up, I was at the seaside.

775
00:55:35,155 --> 00:55:38,425
I saw the knife and Na Jung's clothes around me.

And the blood on her clothes.

I don't know why I was there.

778
00:55:46,196 --> 00:55:47,965
When I found Na Jung...

779
00:55:47,966 --> 00:55:49,336
from the alley in Samjung-dong around the construction site,

780

Na Jung!

00:55:53,535 --> 00:55:55,376
Over here! Please help...

783
00:55:57,436 --> 00:55:59,305
I only remember getting hit in the head.

784
00:56:05,716 --> 00:56:08,015
The blood on Na Jung's clothes...

785
00:56:08,356 --> 00:56:10,586
is enough to cause death.

786
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:13,155
This will be the prosecutor's argument.

787
00:56:14,756 --> 00:56:16,696
That you killed Na Jung...

788
00:56:18,225 --> 00:56:19,365
and...

789
00:56:20,595 --> 00:56:21,936
you abandoned her body too.

790
00:56:22,035 --> 00:56:23,236
She wasn't dead.

791
00:56:24,066 --> 00:56:27,506
When she was in my arms, she was definitely alive.

792
00:56:28,175 --> 00:56:30,946
Na Jung's body was warm, and I could hear her breathing.

793
00:56:31,475 --> 00:56:34,575
I have to find her. I need to find her now!

794
00:56:35,276 --> 00:56:38,086
The report from the NFS is pointing Kim Dong Gu as the culprit.

795
00:56:38,345 --> 00:56:39,545
What more do you need?

796
00:56:39,546 --> 00:56:41,114
It says two fingerprints...

797
00:56:41,115 --> 00:56:43,155
were found on the knife other than Kim Dong Gu's.

798
00:56:43,716 --> 00:56:47,285
Oh, that? One of them belongs to the cop who was at the scene.

799
00:56:47,425 --> 00:56:50,054
And the other one belonged to the civilian...

800
00:56:50,055 --> 00:56:52,296
who found the crime scene and called the police. Right?

801
00:56:52,466 --> 00:56:54,696
Yes. Right. That was the civilian's.

802
00:57:00,265 --> 00:57:01,876
I did call the police.

803
00:57:02,205 --> 00:57:05,146
Gosh. I was so scared.

804
00:57:05,475 --> 00:57:08,515
Did you see the knife that was found at the crime scene?

805
00:57:08,975 --> 00:57:11,646
The knife? How could I have seen that?

806
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:14,555
I thought I was going to lose my mind when I saw that.

807
00:57:14,785 --> 00:57:18,455
I saw it on the news that they found a knife...

808
00:57:18,655 --> 00:57:21,796
and bloodstained clothes. That's how I found out.

809
00:57:22,725 --> 00:57:23,896
Thank you.

810
00:57:26,365 --> 00:57:28,066
It's possible that he's innocent.

811
00:57:28,135 --> 00:57:30,635
I can prove that the evidence that was found on the weapon...

812
00:57:31,166 --> 00:57:33,466
at the crime scene doesn't make sense.

813
00:57:34,305 --> 00:57:37,705
Kim Dong Gu is not guilty. Is that the correct answer?

814
00:57:39,646 --> 00:57:41,816
Is it worth it?

815
00:57:43,745 --> 00:57:45,515

00:57:54,756 --> 00:57:56,896
wrap up this case, and go work at his law firm.

821
00:57:58,495 --> 00:58:02,836
So are you telling me to give up on my client?

822
00:58:05,236 --> 00:58:06,865
Are you telling me to give up on arguing for his innocence...

823
00:58:06,966 --> 00:58:09,106
and to just pretend to defend him?

824
00:58:09,675 --> 00:58:11,175
Pretend to defend him?

825
00:58:12,646 --> 00:58:15,845
Do you think I would ask my student to pretend to do her job?

826
00:58:16,515 --> 00:58:19,216
It's clear that Kim Dong Gu is the culprit.

827
00:58:19,316 --> 00:58:21,256
All the evidence and circumstantial evidence...

828
00:58:21,486 --> 00:58:23,816
are pointing him as the culprit.

829
00:58:24,526 --> 00:58:26,655
Why rock the boat?

830
00:58:26,885 --> 00:58:28,526
Is that what you learned from me?

831
00:58:28,955 --> 00:58:31,425
"Never let my client end up in prison."

832
00:58:31,725 --> 00:58:33,896
That's what you taught me in your first class.

833
00:58:34,566 --> 00:58:36,494
There's a possibility that Kim Dong Gu is innocent.

834
00:58:36,495 --> 00:58:38,666
Are you asking me to ignore that?

835
00:58:43,705 --> 00:58:46,376
Your older brothers and mother were brought in...

836
00:58:47,646 --> 00:58:50,046
for fraud again. Did you know about that?

837
00:58:52,486 --> 00:58:55,086
There's less than 0.1 percent chance that he's innocent.

838
00:58:56,356 --> 00:59:00,325
Don't waste your life on a worthless possibility.

839
00:59:03,225 --> 00:59:04,865
Just go with the flow.

840
00:59:10,736 --> 00:59:11,936
Your Honour.

841
00:59:12,236 --> 00:59:14,936
Three fingerprints were found on the knife.

842
00:59:15,175 --> 00:59:17,875
Even if the defendant's fingerprint was found,

843
00:59:17,876 --> 00:59:19,375
we must examine the other two...

844
00:59:19,376 --> 00:59:22,375
Your Honour. One of the fingerprints belonged to...

845
00:59:22,376 --> 00:59:25,245
a police officer who was dispatched to the scene.

846
00:59:25,285 --> 00:59:27,445
And the other fingerprint belonged to the witness...

847
00:59:27,446 --> 00:59:28,784
who found Kim Dong Gu at the scene.

848
00:59:28,785 --> 00:59:31,055
We have a statement that the witness grabbed the knife.

849
00:59:31,325 --> 00:59:34,455
It's only a statement. It wasn't thoroughly investigated.

850
00:59:34,595 --> 00:59:37,595
Your Honour, we need to check...

851
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:41,094
if the unidentified fingerprint belongs to the witness.

852
00:59:41,095 --> 00:59:44,506
Counsel, I don't think that's important.

853
00:59:44,635 --> 00:59:45,665
What's important is that...

854
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:48,606
the defendant's fingerprint was found on the knife.

855
00:59:48,675 --> 00:59:50,005
That's right, Your Honour.

856
00:59:50,006 --> 00:59:52,005
The defendant confessed,

857
00:59:52,006 --> 00:59:54,745
and the defendant's fingerprint and DNA were found on the knife.

858
00:59:55,046 --> 00:59:57,276
The other fingerprints on the knife don't matter in this case.

859
00:59:57,646 --> 00:59:58,815
So it doesn't matter...

860
00:59:58,816 --> 01:00:01,416
if the unidentified fingerprint belongs to the witness or not.

861
01:00:01,555 --> 01:00:02,586
If I may be bold,

862
01:00:03,256 --> 01:00:05,256
even if the knife had my fingerprint,

863
01:00:06,155 --> 01:00:07,785
your fingerprint,

864
01:00:08,155 --> 01:00:10,325
or the judge's fingerprint,

865
01:00:10,425 --> 01:00:12,665
it's not important in this case.

866
01:00:12,666 --> 01:00:13,896
(Judge)

867
01:00:30,946 --> 01:00:32,615
Why are you here again?

868
01:00:32,916 --> 01:00:34,486
No, Soo Jae.

869
01:00:35,086 --> 01:00:37,256
I didn't con anyone.

870
01:00:37,586 --> 01:00:39,026
I didn't do it.

871
01:00:39,186 --> 01:00:41,825
Right, Soo Jae. We really didn't do it.

872
01:00:42,095 --> 01:00:44,155
We were conned.

873
01:00:44,896 --> 01:00:48,166
You'll get us out of here, right?

874
01:00:48,535 --> 01:00:50,135
You'll get us out, right?

875
01:00:55,475 --> 01:00:56,535
Counsel.

876
01:00:58,175 --> 01:01:00,475
Is there anything else you want to say or submit as evidence?

877
01:01:06,615 --> 01:01:07,916
Your Honour.

878
01:01:08,455 --> 01:01:12,955
It is my opinion that she's trying to delay the trial.

879
01:01:13,356 --> 01:01:14,654
(Judge)

880
01:01:14,655 --> 01:01:15,696
Counsel.

881
01:01:26,305 --> 01:01:27,436
No, Your Honour.

882
01:01:41,115 --> 01:01:42,614
(The witness changed his statement. Possibility of perjury)

883
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:43,985
(Possibility of filing an appeal, possible)

884
01:01:43,986 --> 01:01:45,385
(Important: Confirming the fingerprint of the witness)

885
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:00,066
I...

886
01:02:02,075 --> 01:02:03,376
gave up on...

887
01:02:05,345 --> 01:02:06,575
Kim Dong Gu.

888
01:02:14,115 --> 01:02:15,316
I...

889
01:02:17,816 --> 01:02:19,055
gave up on you.

890
01:02:19,686 --> 01:02:22,696
(Why Her?)

891
01:02:43,015 --> 01:02:45,445
I'll find evidence that No Byung Chul isn't the culprit.

892
01:02:45,446 --> 01:02:47,416
I'm not interested. And don't get close.

893
01:02:47,486 --> 01:02:49,154
You deceived Soo Jae!

894
01:02:49,155 --> 01:02:50,586
And she gave up on you.

895
01:02:51,115 --> 01:02:54,224
Tell me everything you know and you think you know.

896
01:02:54,225 --> 01:02:56,494
Bring me Seo Jun Myeong!

897
01:02:56,495 --> 01:02:58,065
Why didn't you answer my call?

898
01:02:58,066 --> 01:02:59,264
Have you been well?

899
01:02:59,265 --> 01:03:01,965
I was curious about the stepsister murder case in Ungju...

900
01:03:01,966 --> 01:03:02,994
ten years ago.

901
01:03:02,995 --> 01:03:05,665
You framed an innocent man, Kim Dong Gu, for the murder.

902
01:03:05,666 --> 01:03:07,804
And you even made No Byung Chul to take the fall for the murder.

903
01:03:07,805 --> 01:03:09,336
I'm sure there's someone behind you.

904
01:03:09,506 --> 01:03:11,005
I'll make sure to take care of this.

905
01:03:11,006 --> 01:03:12,006
Right here!

906
01:03:12,007 --> 01:03:14,375
Going after them without any concrete evidence...

907
01:03:14,376 --> 01:03:15,415
Shut it.

908
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:18,146
I trusted you to take care of something that my life depends on.

909
01:03:18,285 --> 01:03:19,384
This is what you bring back?

910
01:03:19,385 --> 01:03:21,385
The culprit realized it for sure...

911
01:03:21,555 --> 01:03:23,686
that what he did has been exposed.
