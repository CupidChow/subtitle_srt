So think carefully about...

4
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,828
how you're going to get rid of Park So Young.

5
00:00:19,928 --> 00:00:21,599
Get rid of her?

6
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:24,128
Why would I do that?

7
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:27,369
Do what you guys are good at.

8
00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:30,768
You can bury people without leaving a trace.

9
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:40,949
Jin Myung, Chief is looking for you.

10
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:52,589
First, I'll try to come up with a strategy.

11
00:00:53,459 --> 00:00:55,998
To make sure they can't issue an arrest warrant, I will...

12
00:00:57,798 --> 00:00:59,068
I mean,

13
00:01:01,568 --> 00:01:04,709
you have to tell me everything honestly, so I can...

14
00:01:09,809 --> 00:01:11,078
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:11,878 --> 00:01:13,848
I'm so shocked by Hong Seok Pal's video.

16
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:16,649
I apologize, Ms. Oh.

17

18
00:01:27,358 --> 00:01:28,429
Ms. Oh.

19
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:31,229
To tell you the truth, I'm very confused right now.

20
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:34,498
I know I shouldn't suspect you,

21
00:01:35,098 --> 00:01:38,708
but you did tell Hong Seok Pal to get rid of Park So Young.

22
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:40,809
Right?

23
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:46,208
I can recognize your voice even when I'm fast asleep.

24
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:50,348
That recording. It was your voice, right?

25
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:53,718
You told him to bury Park So Young.

26
00:01:53,889 --> 00:01:57,488
Good. Her devoted sidekick is now beginning to doubt her.

27
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:01,358
It was you who said those words, right?

28
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:06,069
Yes, admit it already.

29

30
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:14,909
Hey, what are they doing? Go check!

31
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:24,718
What's going on here? What did you tell her?

32
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,648
I dropped it, so I bent down to pick it up.

33
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,988
What did you say to her?

34
00:02:29,558 --> 00:02:32,229
She told me to get lost. What's your problem?

35
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:33,828
What did she say?

36
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:36,298
What did she whisper to you about?

37
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:39,298
Who is the one that is swayed by whispers?

38
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,069
What are you saying?

39
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,208

You know that we're still investigating the case.

46

And you know that we're investigating...

47
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:28,017
Park So Young's death because the police made a grave mistake...

48
00:03:28,018 --> 00:03:31,949
of concluding that she killed herself when she was murdered.

49
00:03:32,048 --> 00:03:34,388
This has nothing to do with that!

50
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:35,759
What are you talking about?

51
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,229
Hong Seok Pal left a confession video admitting that he killed her.

52
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:43,898
The two cases should be merged as one.

53
00:03:44,028 --> 00:03:46,498
And of course, we'll let you know...

There!

70
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,338
Oh, I saw her on the news.

71
00:05:04,549 --> 00:05:07,879
Lawyer Oh Soo Jae! You are Oh Soo Jae, right?

72
00:05:09,148 --> 00:05:12,049
Oh, boy. We have a real feisty newbie.

73

Goodness.

74
00:05:14,288 --> 00:05:15,689
Here.

75
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,059
So it wasn't her?

76
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:23,429
That really wasn't Professor Oh's voice?

77
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:24,968
Telling him to bury Park So Young.

78
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:28,439
That's right. She clearly told me that it wasn't her.

79
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:33,838
The last sentence. I didn't say it.

80
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:37,278
That's not my voice. You need to prove it.

81
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,348
What about everything else?

82
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:40,577
"Think carefully about..."

83
00:05:40,578 --> 00:05:42,549
"how you're going to get rid of Park So Young." That one.

84
00:05:43,549 --> 00:05:44,749
That was Professor Oh.

85
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:47,287
She did say it to Hong Seok Pal on the phone a while back.

86
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:49,888
So the beginning of the recording is real,

87
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:51,118
but the last sentence is fake?

88
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:53,228
But why? Why just that sentence?

89
00:05:53,528 --> 00:05:54,727
To make a fake recording like that,

90
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:56,957
you'd need hours' worth of voice data,

91
00:05:56,958 --> 00:06:00,398
and you'd have to hire someone to make it. It's such a hassle.

92
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:02,239
To get her charged with instigating a murder.

93
00:06:05,609 --> 00:06:07,407
"Get rid of her" is vague, so...

94
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,038
So they needed the word, "bury".

95
00:06:09,908 --> 00:06:11,508
Because it proves that she wanted her dead.

96
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:14,577
Goodness. Even after deciding to take his own life,

97
00:06:14,578 --> 00:06:17,848
he tried to get away with what he did. What a scumbag.

98
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:22,389
Hong Seok Pal actually visited TK once.

99
00:06:23,288 --> 00:06:25,227
He had something to say about Park So Young...

100
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:26,788
and wanted to meet with Chairman Choi.

101
00:06:27,489 --> 00:06:28,898
Hong Seok Pal? Why?

102
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:30,858
But he couldn't meet with Chairman Choi that day.

103
00:06:30,859 --> 00:06:33,228
He briefly met with Mr. Ha and left.

104
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:35,898
It was a week before he died.

105
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:40,167
Then let's retrace Hong's steps during that one week.

106
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:41,908
Getting that fake recording made...

107
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:43,978
and preparing for that explosion.

108
00:06:44,749 --> 00:06:45,808
He must've been busy.

109
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:48,879
By the way, why didn't you tell the police...

110
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:51,619
that it wasn't Professor Oh's voice?

111
00:06:52,489 --> 00:06:53,918
Was it intentional or not?

112
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:58,088
She told me in secret,

113
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:01,929
which means that she doesn't trust anyone,

114
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:05,929
including the police, the prosecution, and TK too.

115
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:08,168

at the office and home of lawyer Oh Soo Jae,

149
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:44,027
He is offended that he's getting roped into Park So Young's death.

150

He also said he'd never even heard of Hong Seok Pal's name.

00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:35,249
from her office and home.

166
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:37,849
There wasn't really anything suspicious...

167
00:09:37,979 --> 00:09:40,288
except for the ones that I left with Mr. Ha.

168
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:43,459
Maybe Ms. Oh was pregnant in the past.

169
00:09:43,558 --> 00:09:46,028
Anyway, I thought you should have a look.

170
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:47,928
Okay, I will.

171
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:02,278

174
00:10:33,668 --> 00:10:35,209
What's with that look on your face?

175
00:10:36,739 --> 00:10:40,009
Have you eaten? I hope you have.

176
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:44,219
Did you sleep well?

177
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:46,288
It wasn't bad.

178
00:10:49,719 --> 00:10:52,629
The warrant review has been scheduled for tomorrow afternoon.

179
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:03,839
And...

180
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:11,749
It's gone, isn't it?

181
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:14,778
Yes.

The footage shows Chairman Han, Assemblyman Lee,

188
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:48,438
and you...

189
00:12:48,908 --> 00:12:52,408
having a good time at my bar.

190
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:56,177
I guarantee you that there is no copy.

191
00:12:56,178 --> 00:12:59,119
I can swear on my life. Please believe me.

192
00:12:59,318 --> 00:13:03,259
And please forgive me for all the trouble I've caused you.

193
00:13:04,018 --> 00:13:07,959
I sent the videos to you, Chairman Han, and Assemblyman Lee...

194
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:10,128
because I was hurt that I was excluded...

195
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:11,328
from the Yeongpyeong District project.

196
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:14,767
All I did was stay loyal to the three of you...

197
00:13:14,768 --> 00:13:16,438
while risking my own life.

198
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,138
I was so upset and hurt.

199
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:20,667
Did you think there'd be no consequences...

200
00:13:20,668 --> 00:13:22,009
for all the trouble you caused?

201
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:24,038
I apologize, sir.

202
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:26,548
I really am terribly sorry, sir.

203
00:13:26,648 --> 00:13:30,278
Assemblyman Lee is livid. He told me to take care of you.

204
00:13:31,688 --> 00:13:34,219
And Chairman Han is in agreement with him.

205
00:13:37,058 --> 00:13:38,629
But I don't want to do that...

206
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,198
because I like you.

207
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:45,428
Thank you, sir. Thank you!

208
00:13:45,768 --> 00:13:47,369
Mr. Ha will tell you what to do.

209
00:13:48,739 --> 00:13:50,267
Do exactly as he says.

210
00:13:50,268 --> 00:13:52,267
Yes, sir. I will never forget your kindness.

211
00:13:52,268 --> 00:13:55,537
And I pledge my unbending loyalty to you, sir.

212
00:13:55,538 --> 00:13:56,678
I give you my loyalty, sir!

(Footage from the villa)

Don't try so hard. You've done enough.

215
00:14:39,489 --> 00:14:40,818
I will keep trying.

216
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:42,918
I won't stop until I can get you out.

217
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:45,927
Chan asked me to tell you not to worry...

218
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,629
and that he'll get you out no matter what.

219
00:14:48,528 --> 00:14:50,759
So just date him when you're released.

220
00:14:51,428 --> 00:14:54,099
I can totally tell that he has a crush on you.

221
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:06,048
We'll save you, Ms. Oh.

222
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:31,468
Forensics conducted an in-depth investigation...

223
00:15:31,469 --> 00:15:34,109
but found nothing as everything was scorched.

224
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:37,579
The charcoal briquettes in the trunk probably started the fire.

225
00:15:37,908 --> 00:15:41,609
Then it caused the explosion due to the oil and butane gas.

226
00:15:41,849 --> 00:15:43,619
Any trace or residue of explosive devices?

227
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:45,348
Explosive devices? Come on.

228
00:15:45,349 --> 00:15:47,488
I told you the charcoal briquettes were what started the fire.

229
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,917
He lit the briquettes himself.

230
00:15:49,918 --> 00:15:51,488
He killed himself. I'm sure of it.

231
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:53,829
Even so, I can't believe you already sent it off to a junkyard.

232
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:55,927
Forensics is done inspecting the vehicle,

233
00:15:55,928 --> 00:15:59,129
and Chief Kang told me to get it out of his sight at once.

234
00:16:03,798 --> 00:16:06,037
Oh, no! What do we do now?

235
00:16:06,038 --> 00:16:07,339
Darn it!

236
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:10,209
My gosh.

237
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:15,079
Do what you guys are good at.

238
00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:18,489
You can bury people without leaving a trace.

239
00:16:18,648 --> 00:16:19,948
Have you tried the voice operation?

240
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:21,688
I have, but...

241
00:16:22,058 --> 00:16:23,359
Why? Is it not going well?

242
00:16:24,558 --> 00:16:26,989
The thing is, there's too much noise.

243
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:29,729
Let me show you. This, right here.

244
00:16:30,099 --> 00:16:32,599
It's background noise interfering with the voice.

245
00:16:32,729 --> 00:16:36,198
And he played the audio file on his phone while recording the video.

246
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:37,898
It's hard to work off of stuff like this.

247
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:41,009
- Thanks. Keep it up. - Sure.

248
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:43,537
What is going on? You told me you could totally do it.

249
00:16:43,538 --> 00:16:45,349
I didn't know what I was getting myself into.

250
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:48,619
I have to say, the recording gives me the heebie-jeebies.

251
00:16:48,818 --> 00:16:50,619
Why? It's a fake.

252
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:52,447
You don't know if this is real or fake.

253
00:16:52,448 --> 00:16:53,647
This could be real.

254
00:16:53,648 --> 00:16:56,989
She wouldn't say stuff like that. Watch what you say.

255
00:16:57,489 --> 00:17:00,959
I just think you should keep an open mind to all possibilities.

256
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:02,459
Are there no other ways?

257
00:17:05,469 --> 00:17:06,969
There is something else we can try.

258
00:17:07,398 --> 00:17:09,968
- What is it? - Bring me the original file.

259
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:12,738
The original of the fake voice file.

260
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,678
Hello!

261
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:24,278
You know, explosives in cars...

262
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:26,389
What is this nonsense about?

263
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:28,858
- Hello. - Yes, hello.

264
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:31,789
I'm sorry, but can you set up explosives in a car?

265
00:17:31,988 --> 00:17:33,828
- I beg your pardon? - Setting up explosives.

266
00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:36,197
Everyone told me to stop talking nonsense.

267
00:17:36,198 --> 00:17:38,329
They all treated me like an idiot.

268
00:17:38,428 --> 00:17:40,629
Gosh, this is nuts.

269
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:42,738
- This place is huge. - My gosh.

270
00:17:42,898 --> 00:17:44,468
How are we going to find the car here?

271
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:48,779
Darn it. We wasted so much time because we lost them.

272
00:17:49,008 --> 00:17:50,707
What if they already scrapped it?

273
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:51,908
No way.

274
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:54,779
- I'll go this way. - Okay.

275
00:18:02,158 --> 00:18:03,789
Ms. Song, it's over there!

276
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:05,258
What?

277
00:18:13,698 --> 00:18:15,698
You jerks!

278
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:20,569
Already? Why are you doing this so fast?

279
00:18:20,738 --> 00:18:23,139
Darn! What do we do now?

280
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:25,809
I feel trapped.

281
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:28,079
We don't have time.

282
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:31,849
Seriously, this is nuts!

283
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:39,458
We regret that one of TK's lawyers, namely Ms. Oh Soo Jae,

284
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:42,598
has been accused of instigating murder...

285
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,198
and aiding and abetting suicide.

286
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:46,428
I'd like to make these three things clear.

287
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,829
First,

288
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:51,498
TK Law Firm had no involvement in this case whatsoever.

289
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:52,908
Second,

290
00:18:53,468 --> 00:18:56,109
TK and the firm's lawyers...

291
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:58,507
will not get involved in the investigation...

292
00:18:58,508 --> 00:19:00,049
or any trials concerning this case.

293
00:19:00,448 --> 00:19:01,549
Third,

294
00:19:01,678 --> 00:19:05,049
we truly hope that the truth comes to light soon.

295
00:19:05,718 --> 00:19:07,619
As soon as the investigation results are announced,

296
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:10,688
we will make our decision on Ms. Oh Soo Jae accordingly.

297
00:19:11,188 --> 00:19:12,188
That'd be all.

298
00:19:12,189 --> 00:19:15,828
TK has officially announced that the firm won't get involved in any way.

299
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:18,628
All eyes are now on what TK will decide to do...

300
00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:19,967
with Ms. Oh Soo Jae.

301
00:19:19,968 --> 00:19:21,069
Next news.

302
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:24,098
SP Partners' plan to acquire Hansu Bio...

303
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:25,569
has been brought to a complete halt.

304
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:27,937
SP Partners is putting a halt to the plan altogether,

305
00:19:27,938 --> 00:19:30,408
claiming that Hansu Group...

306
00:19:30,508 --> 00:19:34,349
has been uncooperative in the due diligence process.

307
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:35,819
They're calling a halt?

308
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,079
What do you mean? What are you talking about?

309
00:19:38,248 --> 00:19:39,988
Yoon Se Pil made a unilateral decision.

310
00:19:41,188 --> 00:19:42,758
We found out just now because of the news.

311
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:47,528
Hansu Group hasn't released an official statement yet.

312
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:51,058
SP Partners' decision will depend on whether Hansu Group...

313
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:52,868
- Darn it. - will be willing to cooperate...

314
00:19:52,869 --> 00:19:54,697
We were uncooperative in the due diligence process?

315
00:19:54,698 --> 00:19:56,099
What is this about?

316
00:19:56,698 --> 00:19:58,198
That's just an excuse, Father.

317
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:00,238
They're doing this...

318
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:01,967
because of Oh Soo Jae.

319
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:04,039
- What? - The thing is...

320
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:07,309
There's a special clause that says the sell-off must be handled by her.

321
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:12,888
So you didn't object to this clause and put it in the contract?

322
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:15,147
Wait. I had reported this to you before...

323
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:17,188
You stupid jerk. Are you serious?

324
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,359
- Get out. - I'm sorry.

325
00:20:20,758 --> 00:20:23,059
Get out before I hit you with the bone!

326
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:28,329
Darn it.

327
00:20:29,168 --> 00:20:30,539
I bet it's a mess.

328
00:20:32,109 --> 00:20:33,507
Chief Legal Officer Han Gi Taek...

329
00:20:33,508 --> 00:20:35,339
is probably getting tortured and taking all the blame.

330
00:20:36,008 --> 00:20:38,678
When Soo Jae added that clause in,

331
00:20:39,978 --> 00:20:41,978
she was a few moves ahead.

332
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,148
I'm sure she's a few moves ahead even in the detention center.

333
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:01,198
Someone who might have a connection with Park So Young.

334
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:06,238
(Choi Tae Guk)

335
00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:12,079
(Han Sung Bum)

336
00:21:13,478 --> 00:21:15,978
(Lee In Soo)

337
00:21:17,718 --> 00:21:20,248
(Hong Seok Pal)

338
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:24,819
Someone who could find out...

339
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:30,599
Park So Young was going to TK Law Firm the night she died.

340
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:34,099
(Han Sung Bum, Lee In Soo)

341
00:21:35,998 --> 00:21:38,599
(Choi Tae Guk)

342
00:21:39,408 --> 00:21:41,569
Someone who knew...

343
00:21:43,938 --> 00:21:46,478
I was meeting Hong Seok Pal the night he died...

344
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:51,118
and was able to bring in Hong Seok Pal to get me involved.

345
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:52,988
(Choi Tae Guk)

346
00:21:55,859 --> 00:22:00,629
(Choi Tae Guk)

347
00:22:02,258 --> 00:22:03,758
I heard they dropped you.

348
00:22:06,498 --> 00:22:08,498
The company you were loyal to.

349
00:22:09,639 --> 00:22:10,937
What a fool.

350
00:22:10,938 --> 00:22:13,309
The company you worked for abandoned you.

351
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:14,869
Good going for you.

352
00:22:15,408 --> 00:22:17,737
You know what? You should go down for this.

353
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:19,278
You should hit rock bottom.

354
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,108
Come on. Be quiet.

355
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:22,978
You be quiet.

356
00:22:35,758 --> 00:22:37,998
Come on, everyone. Lighten up.

357
00:22:38,258 --> 00:22:41,428
All right. Please enjoy your food.

358
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:45,339
That way, it will activate your brain.

359
00:22:46,668 --> 00:22:47,668
Right?

360
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:54,678
Look at this table of smart people. Why are you so worried?

361
00:22:55,008 --> 00:22:56,178
You'll find a way.

362
00:22:58,178 --> 00:22:59,418
You should eat first.

363
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,519
You guys are the best.

364
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:05,928
- Thank you for the food. - Right.

365
00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:09,198
I watched the video with Hyung Chil.

366
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:12,369
We noticed something odd.

367
00:23:12,998 --> 00:23:14,427
- The video? - Yes.

368
00:23:14,428 --> 00:23:16,569
The video where Hong Seok Pal said he would kill himself.

369
00:23:16,968 --> 00:23:18,069
What about that?

370
00:23:18,968 --> 00:23:20,109
Well,

371
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:23,109
when I looked at Hong Seok Pal's fingers,

372
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:25,238
I noticed something there.

373
00:23:25,748 --> 00:23:26,848
His fingers?

374
00:23:26,849 --> 00:23:29,848
You can't see it clearly when you watch the video.

375
00:23:29,849 --> 00:23:32,888
But when you zoom in the screenshot of the video...

376
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:34,849
Look at his fingers.

377
00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:42,898
- Hey. - What was that?

378
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:46,198
All right. This time, only pay attention...

379
00:23:46,398 --> 00:23:48,228
to his fingers in the video.

380
00:23:53,109 --> 00:23:54,908
He's repeating a movement.

381
00:23:55,139 --> 00:23:56,379
Is that a signal?

382
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,178
Right. Auctions.

383
00:23:59,748 --> 00:24:01,379
Right? You can see that, right?

384
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:02,878
- Auctions? - Yes.

385
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:07,019
That's the signal people use at auctions at fish markets.

386
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,418
- I see. - I see.

387
00:24:09,918 --> 00:24:12,559
One. Nine.

388
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:15,129
One. Nine.

389
00:24:16,398 --> 00:24:17,498
One and nine?

390
00:24:19,569 --> 00:24:21,728
What is it? What do the numbers mean?

391
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,938
- Ha Il Gu. - Ha Il Gu?

392
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:29,539
Mr. Ha?

393
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:34,278
Hong Seok Pal collected files on us to use them against us.

394
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:35,849
And I have all of them now.

395
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:41,418
Gosh, of course. I have the USB flash drive too.

396
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,119
Yes.

397
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:45,688
Gosh. Lower your voice, Chairman Han.

398
00:24:46,658 --> 00:24:48,998
We can easily adjust the sell-off date.

399
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:52,128
The lawyer in charge of the sell-off is Choi Ju Wan,

400
00:24:52,129 --> 00:24:53,498
not Oh Soo Jae.

401
00:24:54,728 --> 00:24:57,269
That minor clause isn't that important.

402
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,069
That greenhorn, Yoon Se Pil.

403
00:25:00,508 --> 00:25:02,438
It all depends on how I handle him.

404
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:04,238
Okay.

405
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:10,119
(Assemblyman Lee In Soo)

406
00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:15,519
Yes, Assemblyman Lee. Of course, I have it.

407
00:25:15,758 --> 00:25:17,789
I'll either get rid of it or hand it over to you.

408
00:25:18,688 --> 00:25:20,289
But I'll handle this.

409
00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:21,529
The presidential election is around the corner.

410
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,859
Why waste your energy on this?

411
00:25:25,228 --> 00:25:27,629
Of course. That's the right attitude.

412
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:29,398
Bye.

413
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:37,738
They had their fun bossing me around, hadn't they?

414
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:50,059
So, where were you...

415
00:25:50,218 --> 00:25:52,258
the night that Park So Young died?

416
00:25:52,589 --> 00:25:54,789
I drove Chairman Choi home,

417
00:25:55,258 --> 00:25:57,099
and then I came back to the office because I had some work left.

418
00:25:57,258 --> 00:26:00,968
The maintenance team called me while I was working in the office,

419
00:26:01,099 --> 00:26:02,569
saying that a woman fell...

420
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:05,168
and that it seemed like she fell from the rooftop garden.

421
00:26:06,139 --> 00:26:08,309
So I went straight to the rooftop garden...

422
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:09,978
And?

423
00:26:10,379 --> 00:26:11,839
There was nothing there.

424
00:26:18,148 --> 00:26:21,119
Mr. Ha will never act on his own.

425
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:27,758
Mr. Ha...

426
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,799
and the man who can do anything he wants through Mr. Ha.

427
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:30,859
Darn it.

428
00:27:32,158 --> 00:27:33,658
(Establish law and order)

429
00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:40,898
(Keep quiet)

430
00:27:49,738 --> 00:27:51,279
Oh Soo Jung.

431
00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:53,408
We were in the same class when we were seniors.

432
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:55,549
Your number was 27. And mine was 28.

433
00:27:56,948 --> 00:27:59,148
Is that your son in the photo?

434
00:28:01,748 --> 00:28:03,918
It's surprising that you actually remember me.

435
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:06,059
How could I not?

436
00:28:06,958 --> 00:28:10,099
I was ranked first in our school, and you were ranked last.

437
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:13,728
Gosh. How annoying.

438
00:28:14,168 --> 00:28:16,168
You are still as annoying as ever.

439
00:28:17,398 --> 00:28:18,467
What are you in for?

440
00:28:18,468 --> 00:28:20,109
Mind your own business.

441
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:22,879
You don't get to judge me.

442
00:28:23,639 --> 00:28:26,678
You instigated murder and made a man commit suicide.

443
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:29,079
I didn't do it. Someone else did it.

444
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,579
Right. I'm sure there is.

445
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:34,889
Everyone in here says the same thing.

446
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:37,417
"I didn't do it. I'm innocent."

447
00:28:37,418 --> 00:28:39,529
But I don't say that.

448
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:41,427
I can admit it.

449
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,228
I committed a crime, so I'm being punished for it.

450
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,059
The only unfair part is that...

451
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:47,928
my sentence is too harsh for the crime I committed.

452
00:28:49,069 --> 00:28:50,539
That's all.

453
00:28:55,539 --> 00:28:58,407
- I'm getting out today. - What?

454
00:28:58,408 --> 00:29:00,849
They will evaluate if the arrest was lawful or not.

455
00:29:01,678 --> 00:29:02,848
There's a 50-50 chance.

456
00:29:02,849 --> 00:29:04,519
But if it gets dismissed, I'll get out.

457
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:08,619
You only have a few hours left...

458
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:11,389
to talk to a successful lawyer.

459
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:16,028
I guess smart people can recognize people's faces well too.

460
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:17,099
So annoying.

461
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:21,299
Did you know your nickname was Oh Annoying?

462
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:24,299
How could I not? You started the nickname.

463
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:46,488
(Ministry of Justice)

464
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:06,678
Let's go.

465
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:17,958
(Defendant)

466
00:30:28,228 --> 00:30:30,539
(Prosecutor)

467
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:34,508
(Defendant)

468
00:30:42,718 --> 00:30:44,078
When you were a public defender,

469
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,348
Seo Jun Myung wiped the floor with you...

470
00:30:45,349 --> 00:30:46,418
for the Kim Dong Gu case, right?

471
00:30:46,648 --> 00:30:48,488
Did that traumatize you for the rest of your life?

472
00:30:49,188 --> 00:30:50,859
Is this your revenge?

473
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:55,089
Get your husband in order, so he doesn't do anything stupid.

474
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,529
If you fail,

475
00:30:57,329 --> 00:30:59,998
you'll see these photos on the courthouse website.

476
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:08,208
Ms. Oh Soo Jae.

477
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:11,878
Do you not have an attorney?

478
00:31:11,879 --> 00:31:13,978
(Defence Counsel)

479
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,558
Your Honour.

480
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:28,487
To avoid delays in trial proceedings,

481
00:31:28,488 --> 00:31:30,859
I suggest you appoint a public defender for Ms. Oh.

482
00:31:31,529 --> 00:31:34,098
Your Honour. This warrant review is being held...

483
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:37,539
to determine whether a warrant should be issued for my arrest.

484
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:40,109
I can defend myself.

485
00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:44,309
Ms. Oh, this warrant review can't be held without your attorney present.

486
00:31:48,748 --> 00:31:50,948
Your Honour, I'm here!

487
00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:55,119
I had to check something. My apologies.

488
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:07,398
Prosecutor, you may begin.

489
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:11,069
That's how Oh Soo Jae blackmailed me.

490
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:13,139
So I had no choice...

491
00:32:14,238 --> 00:32:15,869
but to kill Park So Young.

492
00:32:17,008 --> 00:32:18,508
Ms. Oh Soo Jae...

493
00:32:18,908 --> 00:32:21,549
ordered Hong Seok Pal to murder Park So Young.

494
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:24,619
Ms. Oh told him to "bury" Park So Young,

495
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:27,289
which clearly meant that Ms. Oh wanted him to kill her.

496
00:32:27,948 --> 00:32:31,258
She threatened to reveal his weakness if he didn't do it.

497
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:34,289
Hong Seok Pal was blackmailed into killing Park So Young.

498
00:32:34,428 --> 00:32:36,498
Then the guilt drove him to suicide.

499
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:39,629
None of it would've happened had she never instigated him.

500
00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:43,898
Ms. Oh, please state whether or not you admit to this.

501
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:46,438
Your Honour.

502
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:49,677
It is extremely unfair that the prosecution wishes to charge her...

503
00:32:49,678 --> 00:32:52,539
with instigating murder and aiding and abetting suicide.

504
00:32:53,879 --> 00:32:55,948
So you object to all the charges?

505
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,848
I object.

506
00:32:57,849 --> 00:33:01,448
Ms. Oh, you can't try to take over when your attorney is doing her job.

507
00:33:01,889 --> 00:33:04,819
Your Honour, there is something I must tell you.

508
00:33:05,158 --> 00:33:07,187
There's evidence to negate the National Forensic Service's report.

509
00:33:07,188 --> 00:33:09,457
The definitive cause of the explosion...

510
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:11,398
was something else.

511
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:12,869
Your Honour.

512
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:16,268
What Counsel is saying now should be discussed...

513
00:33:16,269 --> 00:33:18,299
during Ms. Oh's trial at the criminal court, not here.

514
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:21,167
We're here to determine whether she should remain in detention,

515
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:23,109
not whether or not she should be deemed guilty.

516
00:33:23,579 --> 00:33:25,707
Ms. Oh is a partner at TK Law Firm.

517
00:33:25,708 --> 00:33:27,108
She is skilled at concealing evidence...

518
00:33:27,109 --> 00:33:29,079
and can defend herself extremely well.

519
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,379
Ergo, she must remain in detention while being tried.

520
00:33:32,248 --> 00:33:34,889
Please kindly remind Counsel that we are here to discuss...

521
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:37,519
whether her arrest warrant should be approved.

522
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:39,119
Counsel.

523
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:42,828
You can bring up these things once the trial commences.

524
00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:45,727
Your Honour. I'm trying to inform you that there is a problem...

525
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,529
with the crucial evidence that brought Ms. Oh here.

526
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:52,599
We've found evidence that her voice in the video was manipulated.

527
00:33:56,309 --> 00:33:58,477
There is evidence that shows her voice was manipulated?

528
00:33:58,478 --> 00:34:01,309
Yes, Your Honour. I confirmed it myself.

529
00:34:01,849 --> 00:34:03,119
What is this evidence?

530
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:05,779
Is it on the list of evidence that was submitted today?

531
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:08,488
It's on its way here now.

532
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:10,859
I confirmed it over the phone.

533
00:34:11,059 --> 00:34:13,458
The person delivering it will arrive any minute now.

534
00:34:13,459 --> 00:34:16,128
Counsel, what are you doing now?

535
00:34:16,158 --> 00:34:19,899
Your Honour. Counsel is showing disrespect to the court.

536
00:34:31,178 --> 00:34:33,677
Your Honour, this is an important piece of evidence.

537
00:34:33,678 --> 00:34:35,649
Please allow us to submit this.

538
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:37,348
Our apologies, Your Honour.

539
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:39,277
He barged in before we could ask him why he was here.

540
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:40,488
Come on. You must leave.

541
00:34:43,689 --> 00:34:47,128
Counsel, what is this all about?

542
00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:50,729
Your Honour. Counsel is intentionally causing a disturbance.

543
00:34:50,928 --> 00:34:53,127
I do not know what it is that he brought,

544
00:34:53,128 --> 00:34:56,228
but Ms. Oh is more than capable of destroying evidence,

545
00:34:56,229 --> 00:34:57,769
and she poses a large flight risk.

546
00:34:58,568 --> 00:35:01,638
The police tried contacting her numerous times...

547
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:03,138
but couldn't reach her,

548
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:05,479
so they had no choice but to arrest her without a warrant.

549
00:35:07,108 --> 00:35:08,749
Investigator Do Jin Myung.

550
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:12,079
Yes, Your Honour. I am Do Jin Myung from Jungang Police Station.

551
00:35:13,419 --> 00:35:14,548
It is true.

552
00:35:14,889 --> 00:35:18,487
Your Honour, I ask you to make a wise decision,

553
00:35:18,488 --> 00:35:20,228
so we can ensure a fair investigation and trial.

554
00:35:20,229 --> 00:35:21,559
Your Honour. However,

555
00:35:22,658 --> 00:35:24,197
the arrest warrant application states that...

556
00:35:24,198 --> 00:35:25,598
Hong's video was a huge factor...

557
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,098
in the police's decision to arrest her without a warrant.

558
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:30,869
Ergo, the video must be examined if it was manipulated in any way.

559
00:35:31,068 --> 00:35:32,398
Also, if there is evidence that...

560
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:33,907
someone else was involved in the explosion,

561
00:35:33,908 --> 00:35:36,168
it means Hong's death should be ruled a homicide, not suicide.

562
00:35:36,169 --> 00:35:38,479
And it must be examined in this courtroom today.

563
00:35:38,709 --> 00:35:40,578
Any evidence that was not submitted in advance...

564
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:41,749
Your Honour.

565
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:46,588
Sorry to interrupt, but I must see it as the detective in charge.

566
00:35:46,988 --> 00:35:48,648
Counsel would like to present this evidence to you.

567
00:35:48,649 --> 00:35:50,818
If you make your decision without even seeing it...

568
00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:53,028
That is preposterous.

569
00:35:53,088 --> 00:35:54,088
Mr. Do.

570
00:35:54,089 --> 00:35:56,628
You took the case from us. So it's your job to investigate properly...

571
00:35:56,729 --> 00:35:58,458
and ask us for additional information,

572
00:35:58,459 --> 00:35:59,459
but you didn't even do that.

573
00:35:59,698 --> 00:36:01,668
When I asked if it was okay to scrap the vehicle so soon...

574
00:36:01,669 --> 00:36:04,738
and whether you had put in a request for digital forensics on the video,

575
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:06,907
you said there was no need.

576
00:36:06,908 --> 00:36:08,468
Why are you bringing this up now?

577
00:36:09,068 --> 00:36:11,638
Your Honour, this is not necessary for...

578
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:12,738
Let's see it.

579
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:17,518
I beg your pardon? Your Honour, we're here to...

580
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:20,149
I know exactly what we're here to do.

581
00:36:23,459 --> 00:36:26,088
Show me only if you're confident that you can turn the tables.

582
00:36:26,689 --> 00:36:29,828
The offences she's been accused of deserve severe punishment.

583
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:32,357
I also believe she's highly likely to destroy evidence.

584
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:35,269
She never once answered when the detective called her,

585
00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:37,939
so her flight risk is considered high.

586
00:36:39,499 --> 00:36:40,608
Ms. Oh.

587
00:36:41,508 --> 00:36:42,508
Yes, Your Honour.

588
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:45,408
What would you do if you were in my shoes?

589
00:36:47,778 --> 00:36:49,178
I would detain the defendant.

590
00:37:14,769 --> 00:37:16,778
So think carefully about...

591
00:37:16,908 --> 00:37:19,238
how you're going to get rid of Park So Young.

592
00:37:19,878 --> 00:37:22,248
Your Honour. If you look at the screen,

593
00:37:22,249 --> 00:37:25,818
you can see that the frequency exhibits the same pattern.

594
00:37:26,048 --> 00:37:28,649
This is Ms. Oh Soo Jae's voice.

595
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:31,689
But the second voice is different.

596
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:35,358
Do what you guys are good at.

597
00:37:35,729 --> 00:37:38,229
You can bury people without leaving a trace.

598
00:37:38,758 --> 00:37:42,769
Your Honour. Look, right there. If you look at the screen,

599
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:47,738
you see that the frequency of this voice is all broken up.

600
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:49,878
What does that mean?

601
00:37:50,139 --> 00:37:54,248
This was created by manipulating Ms. Oh's voice dataset.

602
00:37:54,249 --> 00:37:56,249
In other words, it's fake.

603
00:37:57,548 --> 00:37:58,649
Thank you.

604
00:38:03,088 --> 00:38:04,518
The next piece of evidence...

605
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:07,459
shows you that someone had installed an explosive device in the car.

606
00:38:09,189 --> 00:38:10,229
An explosive device?

607
00:38:12,158 --> 00:38:14,229
In a car? Why do you need this?

608
00:38:14,399 --> 00:38:16,428
I told you. We're shooting a movie, an action film.

609
00:38:17,198 --> 00:38:19,669
You know, the kind where cars blow up and fly away.

610
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:22,408
My goodness. I've never gotten a request like this before.

611
00:38:23,608 --> 00:38:25,738
But this will be a tricky job.

612
00:38:25,878 --> 00:38:28,278
I'll pay you well.

613
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:32,547
This man brought Hong Seok Pal's car...

614
00:38:32,548 --> 00:38:35,818
and asked them to install an explosive device, which he brought.

615
00:38:36,019 --> 00:38:39,158
It's possible that Hong Seok Pal hired someone...

616
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:42,728
to get the device installed so he could take his own life.

617
00:38:42,729 --> 00:38:44,728
Who'd hire someone to go and get an explosive device...

618
00:38:44,729 --> 00:38:47,598
installed in their car, so they could commit suicide?

619
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,329
You can't say no one would ever do that.

620
00:38:49,669 --> 00:38:50,939
That's enough.

621
00:38:51,769 --> 00:38:52,838
Your Honour.

622
00:38:58,608 --> 00:39:00,149
(Prosecutor)

623
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:13,559
Put it on.

624
00:39:14,858 --> 00:39:16,527
Chief Legal Officer Han Gi Taek of Hansu Group has confessed...

625
00:39:16,528 --> 00:39:18,257
that he helped Mr. Hong Seok Pal...

626
00:39:18,258 --> 00:39:20,399
install an explosive device in his car...

627
00:39:20,528 --> 00:39:23,297
and that he was also involved in manipulating...

628
00:39:23,298 --> 00:39:24,638
Ms. Oh Soo Jae's voice in the video.

629
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:26,668
- Han Gi Taek? - Mr. Han has stated...

630
00:39:26,669 --> 00:39:28,837
that Mr. Hong was tormenting himself...

631
00:39:28,838 --> 00:39:31,808
about the failure of his business and killing Ms. Park So Young.

632
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:33,478
He made the decision to assist Mr. Hong...

633
00:39:33,479 --> 00:39:36,078
with his suicide as he was in utter despair.

634
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:39,547
The police plan to request an arrest warrant for Mr. Han...

635
00:39:39,548 --> 00:39:41,749
in order to find out exactly what he did...

636
00:39:41,889 --> 00:39:45,289
to assist with Mr. Hong's suicide.

637
00:39:45,459 --> 00:39:47,229
What was your relationship with Hong Seok Pal?

638
00:39:47,389 --> 00:39:49,658
Is it true that you assisted him with his suicide?

639
00:39:51,798 --> 00:39:52,899
Yes, it is true.

640
00:39:57,338 --> 00:39:59,697
I'm telling you. Hey, look.

641
00:39:59,698 --> 00:40:00,809
Here.

642
00:40:02,439 --> 00:40:03,439
Gosh.

643
00:40:23,858 --> 00:40:26,298
(Shack)

644
00:40:29,169 --> 00:40:30,638
He asked me to install a bomb in his car,

645
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:32,099
so it would end him for good.

646
00:40:33,238 --> 00:40:35,669
I said no. I told him to hang in there.

647
00:40:36,678 --> 00:40:39,278
But he couldn't stop thinking about killing her, so he was in agony.

648
00:40:40,709 --> 00:40:42,777
And he couldn't work for Hansu Construction...

649
00:40:42,778 --> 00:40:44,249
because of Oh Soo Jae.

650
00:40:47,419 --> 00:40:50,088
You want me to say that I will kill myself in a video?

651
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:56,128
Then do you have a body to replace me?

652
00:40:56,628 --> 00:40:58,197
You think we would have a problem with that?

653
00:40:58,198 --> 00:41:01,099
So when the fire starts,

654
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:04,269
I have to sneak out of the car?

655
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:06,468
And you'll put in a corpse then, right?

656
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:07,908
Right.

657
00:41:08,309 --> 00:41:09,439
Gosh.

658
00:41:12,709 --> 00:41:16,008
Il Gu. I'll go to China...

659
00:41:16,178 --> 00:41:19,619
and get a whole new face. I'll even get a new name.

660
00:41:19,678 --> 00:41:22,649
Then I'll come back after two years.

661
00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:25,959
And you promised me to look after my businesses until then.

662
00:41:26,289 --> 00:41:27,858
You have to keep your promise.

663
00:41:28,858 --> 00:41:30,027
Okay.

664
00:41:30,028 --> 00:41:33,158
Il Gu. I really can't die.

665
00:41:34,169 --> 00:41:37,698
My kids and my wife... You know they all depend on me.

666
00:41:38,968 --> 00:41:40,309
Exactly.

667
00:41:41,468 --> 00:41:43,269
You should trust Chairman Choi Tae Guk.

668
00:41:43,778 --> 00:41:47,178
Assemblyman Lee and Chairman Han both wanted to get rid of you.

669
00:41:47,709 --> 00:41:50,979
But only Chairman Choi is trying to save you.

670
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,119
Hey.

671
00:41:58,119 --> 00:41:59,218
I...

672
00:42:00,128 --> 00:42:02,928
killed Park So Young...

673
00:42:04,758 --> 00:42:06,729
for Oh Soo Jae from TK Law Firm.

674
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:10,269
The person who pushed Park So Young...

675
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:12,838
off the rooftop of the TK building...

676
00:42:21,508 --> 00:42:23,008
I will meet with Oh Soo Jae...

677
00:42:23,948 --> 00:42:25,378
one last time.

678
00:42:27,189 --> 00:42:28,548
And I will commit...

679
00:42:29,818 --> 00:42:32,189
suicide in front of her.

680
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:44,099
I installed the bomb like you asked me, sir.

681
00:42:44,568 --> 00:42:46,099
But do you have to kill him?

682
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:49,407
Gosh. You can just send him abroad.

683
00:42:49,408 --> 00:42:51,338
The video from Hong Seok Pal's hostess bar.

684
00:42:52,209 --> 00:42:55,079
How would you feel if your family watched that video?

685
00:42:57,178 --> 00:43:00,548
I doubt you want to lose your family on top of 27 million dollars.

686
00:43:01,488 --> 00:43:03,249
(Chairman Choi Tae Guk)

687
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:25,508
(Hyundae Snack Bar, Recreational Boats)

688
00:43:48,528 --> 00:43:49,528
Hong Seok Pal said he was resentful that...

689
00:43:49,529 --> 00:43:51,698
his businesses weren't going well because of Ms. Oh Soo Jae.

690
00:43:52,198 --> 00:43:54,209
So he wanted to get revenge on her before he died.

691
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:58,878
So he lied that Ms. Oh Soo Jae ordered him to kill Park So Young.

692
00:44:00,309 --> 00:44:02,178
Hong Seok Pal killed Park So Young.

693
00:44:03,209 --> 00:44:06,419
I would like to apologize to Ms. Oh Soo Jae.

694
00:44:07,488 --> 00:44:09,689
- Can you answer one more question? - One more comment!

695
00:44:09,789 --> 00:44:11,919
That crazy jerk, Han Gi Taek.

696
00:44:12,419 --> 00:44:15,628
How could he help Hong Seok Pal commit suicide?

697
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:18,499
This fool is just like his father.

698
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:21,297
Goodness. I can't believe I trusted him.

699
00:44:21,298 --> 00:44:23,369
I gave that fool a chance.

700
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,599
Right.

701
00:44:26,198 --> 00:44:28,237
I was so shocked. I can't even imagine how you...

702
00:44:28,238 --> 00:44:30,378
I have a lot of stuff to get done regarding Hansu Bio...

703
00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:32,837
and Yeongpyeong District.

704
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:34,108
Right.

705
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,277
Try to calm down.

706
00:44:37,278 --> 00:44:38,619
I'm hanging up!

707
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:46,928
Father, I really don't get it.

708
00:44:47,088 --> 00:44:49,758
Why would Gi Taek get mixed up with someone like Hong Seok Pal?

709
00:44:51,698 --> 00:44:54,399
Hong Seok Pal probably had something on him.

710
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:56,329
Pathetic.

711
00:44:56,468 --> 00:44:58,468
It must have been really bad.

712
00:44:59,568 --> 00:45:01,639
Helping a suicidal man is beyond me.

713
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:04,108
Any news from SP Partners?

714
00:45:04,238 --> 00:45:06,608
I'm meeting with Mr. Yoon Se Pil tomorrow.

715
00:45:06,908 --> 00:45:09,579
He brought up the clause that...

716
00:45:09,608 --> 00:45:12,677
Soo Jae must execute the sell-off and unilaterally paused the process.

717
00:45:12,678 --> 00:45:13,947
Unbelievable.

718
00:45:13,948 --> 00:45:15,217
Han Gi Taek turned himself in.

719
00:45:15,218 --> 00:45:16,817
And Soo Jae will get acquitted and get released today.

720
00:45:16,818 --> 00:45:18,019
Things will change.

721
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:20,487
Right. Since they stopped the process unilaterally,

722
00:45:20,488 --> 00:45:22,428
I'll tell them to move things along twice as fast.

723
00:45:35,169 --> 00:45:36,338
Gosh, that punk.

724
00:45:37,709 --> 00:45:39,709
- Give us the room. - Okay.

725
00:45:51,658 --> 00:45:54,189
- Ha Il Gu. - Ha Il Gu?

726
00:45:54,829 --> 00:45:55,988
Mr. Ha?

727
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,499
(Mr. Ko)

728
00:46:04,838 --> 00:46:06,068
Mr. Ko?

729
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:07,669
Yes.

730
00:46:08,169 --> 00:46:10,108
Ms. Oh asked you to do that?

731
00:46:10,678 --> 00:46:13,008
Yes. I'll head over there now.

732
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:16,007
He found evidence that...

733
00:46:16,008 --> 00:46:18,579
someone brought Hong Seok Pal's car and asked to install a bomb.

734
00:46:18,649 --> 00:46:20,078
- I'll call you. - Okay.

735
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,749
Ms. Song. Let me come with you!

736
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:27,459
So the bomb in the car has been handled.

737
00:46:29,389 --> 00:46:31,028
Who is this Ha Il Gu person?

738
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:34,869
Mr. Ha?

739
00:46:36,269 --> 00:46:38,439
Are you talking about the chairman's executive secretary?

740
00:46:39,568 --> 00:46:41,209
Chan, come with me.

741
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:44,708
We should check where he is right now.

742
00:46:44,709 --> 00:46:48,008
Who cares where he is? I'll make him give them to me.

743
00:46:48,579 --> 00:46:49,648
The confession video...

744
00:46:49,649 --> 00:46:51,348
and the original file of the fabricated recording.

745
00:46:51,349 --> 00:46:52,818
I'll make him give them to me.

746
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:55,518
Let's think about it first. We need to come up with a plan.

747
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:58,189
That comes first. Okay?

748
00:47:06,399 --> 00:47:07,468
Mr. Ha.

749
00:47:14,908 --> 00:47:17,278
What's this about? Why can't you just spit it out?

750
00:47:18,479 --> 00:47:23,008
Besides, stop asking me to meet you outside like this.

751
00:48:35,318 --> 00:48:36,548
Darn it.

752
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:44,399
(Choi Yoon Sang)

753
00:48:46,428 --> 00:48:47,468
Mr. Ha.

754
00:48:47,899 --> 00:48:51,499
I took the voice files of Soo Jae and the fabricated recording file.

755
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:53,238
Go tell my dad.

756
00:48:53,838 --> 00:48:56,869
If he promises me not to come after my teammates...

757
00:48:57,108 --> 00:48:59,639
from the security cameras,

758
00:48:59,939 --> 00:49:01,508
tell him I'll go see him.

759
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:03,919
Sorry, Mr. Ha.

760
00:49:39,948 --> 00:49:41,419
You're my son.

761
00:49:42,789 --> 00:49:45,119
My son cannot defy me.

762
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:48,628
Okay?

763
00:49:53,158 --> 00:49:54,269
Father.

764
00:49:55,099 --> 00:49:56,829
Make me Soo Jae's intern.

765
00:49:58,669 --> 00:50:00,908
I don't like the way you treat her.

766
00:50:01,169 --> 00:50:03,139
And you want to know what she's up to.

767
00:50:04,378 --> 00:50:06,678
I can help you and Soo Jae in the middle.

768
00:50:07,408 --> 00:50:09,108
I'm determined to be a double agent.

769
00:50:10,408 --> 00:50:12,178
And if you think I'm doing a good job,

770
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:16,718
let me have TK Law Firm.

771
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:18,689
I might be better than Ju Wan.

772
00:50:19,588 --> 00:50:20,689
I'm sure you know...

773
00:50:21,028 --> 00:50:22,729
I always had better grades than him.

774
00:50:41,548 --> 00:50:42,849
Aiding and abetting.

775
00:50:43,948 --> 00:50:45,649
At Max, you'll get a year.

776
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:48,519
I'll help you get out on probation.

777
00:50:49,889 --> 00:50:51,119
Turn yourself in.

778
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:54,689
And plead the Fifth.

779
00:50:55,358 --> 00:50:57,258
The day you get released on probation,

780
00:50:58,358 --> 00:51:00,729
your 27 million dollars will be 40 million dollars.

781
00:51:13,238 --> 00:51:14,448
Forty million dollars.

782
00:51:19,919 --> 00:51:21,088
Forty million dollars.

783
00:51:24,389 --> 00:51:25,559
Forty million dollars.

784
00:51:31,999 --> 00:51:35,729
I will dismiss the defendant, Oh Soo Jae's arrest warrant.

785
00:51:37,769 --> 00:51:39,238
(Prosecution)

786
00:51:50,378 --> 00:51:52,349
Jun Hee was right.

787
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,019
Why? Are you worried that Soo Jae might not get out?

788
00:51:59,959 --> 00:52:01,388
Back in school,

789
00:52:01,389 --> 00:52:03,388
Soo Jae had the highest marks in the liberal arts department.

790
00:52:03,389 --> 00:52:04,958
And I had the highest marks in the math and science department.

791
00:52:04,959 --> 00:52:07,369
It's not easy for those two to be friends, you know?

792
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,428
But we became best friends as soon as we met.

793
00:52:09,698 --> 00:52:10,838
Do you know why?

794
00:52:11,999 --> 00:52:14,338
Crazy girls can recognize each other.

795
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,639
Mark my words.

796
00:52:18,979 --> 00:52:22,548
People who came after this crazy girl should be in fear.

797
00:52:23,778 --> 00:52:26,419
"Gosh. I shouldn't have messed with her."

798
00:52:27,988 --> 00:52:31,459
"I'm about to go down for trying to sabotage her."

799
00:52:32,488 --> 00:52:34,258
They'll realize that.

800
00:52:42,928 --> 00:52:44,939
Kang Ja, the warrant request was dismissed!

801
00:52:46,369 --> 00:52:47,369
What?

802
00:52:50,738 --> 00:52:53,107
Okay. Thank you. Hey, it was dismissed!

803
00:52:53,108 --> 00:52:55,749
- Dismissed? Yes! - Yes, it was dismissed!

804
00:52:56,579 --> 00:52:58,149
- Dismissed! - Yes!

805
00:52:58,278 --> 00:52:59,677
It was dismissed!

806
00:52:59,678 --> 00:53:01,587
Yes! Good job, Ms. Song!

807
00:53:01,588 --> 00:53:04,357
I knew it! We won!

808
00:53:04,358 --> 00:53:05,889
Good work, Ms. Song.

809
00:53:06,459 --> 00:53:08,128
(Kang Ja, Ms. Song Mi Rim, Se Ryeon, Professor Oh Soo Jae, Yoon Sang...)

810
00:53:12,198 --> 00:53:16,528
(Yoon Sang)

811
00:53:18,899 --> 00:53:21,837
The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to voicemail.

812
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:22,939
Please leave a message...

813
00:53:25,939 --> 00:53:28,248
Tell me where his office is. I can do it.

814
00:53:28,249 --> 00:53:29,777
If your father finds out, he won't...

815
00:53:29,778 --> 00:53:31,318
That's why I have to do it.

816
00:53:31,979 --> 00:53:33,448
That way, everyone will be safe.

817
00:53:34,289 --> 00:53:36,189
And I won't let you do all the cool stuff.

818
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:38,318
I want to impress Soo Jae too.

819
00:54:07,218 --> 00:54:08,689
I hear there's a group of people...

820
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:11,358
trying to buy as many shares of your company as possible.

821
00:54:11,988 --> 00:54:14,358
We're about to sell the company.

822
00:54:14,959 --> 00:54:16,189
Buy some shares.

823
00:54:16,329 --> 00:54:20,028
Ms. Oh is out now. We'll be expediting it.

824
00:54:21,068 --> 00:54:22,998
Hey, can you take a break from your social media...

825
00:54:22,999 --> 00:54:24,738
until the sell-off is finalized?

826
00:54:25,338 --> 00:54:28,567
Posting those ridiculous posts every day won't help the sell-off.

827
00:54:28,568 --> 00:54:29,768
Why not?

828
00:54:29,769 --> 00:54:32,309
Checking out his social media is the highlight of my day.

829
00:54:32,539 --> 00:54:35,248
He posted a photo of raw chicken at 5am.

830
00:54:35,249 --> 00:54:37,408
"Good morning, chicken." Seriously?

831
00:54:37,979 --> 00:54:41,019
But he gets a lot of likes for his posts.

832
00:54:41,048 --> 00:54:42,848
He has over a million followers.

833
00:54:42,849 --> 00:54:46,718
I'm promoting organic raw chicken my department store is selling.

834
00:54:48,729 --> 00:54:51,028
By the way, it was you...

835
00:54:51,658 --> 00:54:54,228
who put out a more entertaining video than mine.

836
00:54:54,229 --> 00:54:56,468
TK Law Firm had no involvement in this case whatsoever.

837
00:54:57,329 --> 00:54:59,297
Secondly, TK...

838
00:54:59,298 --> 00:55:00,598
- Turn that off. - and the firm's lawyers...

839
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:03,607
Did you know you looked really determined that day?

840
00:55:03,608 --> 00:55:05,209
will not get involved in the investigation...

841
00:55:05,539 --> 00:55:06,908
I told you to turn it off!

842
00:55:18,818 --> 00:55:20,019
Why did you get involved?

843
00:55:20,189 --> 00:55:22,528
Who do you think you are? Getting in our business?

844
00:55:22,658 --> 00:55:24,599
I'm sorry, sir.

845
00:55:25,729 --> 00:55:27,158
You're fired.

846
00:55:28,028 --> 00:55:29,229
Get lost.

847
00:55:30,198 --> 00:55:32,198
Hey, that's enough.

848
00:55:32,338 --> 00:55:33,967
We're not in private.

849
00:55:33,968 --> 00:55:36,338
Do you want this to go viral on your beloved social media?

850
00:55:37,169 --> 00:55:38,979
Exactly.

851
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:43,079
Why did you have to annoy me like that?

852
00:55:50,448 --> 00:55:51,959
It's Gi Taek's wife.

853
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:54,658
His wife must be shell-shocked.

854
00:55:55,428 --> 00:55:58,798
But still. That guy cared a lot about his family, didn't he?

855
00:56:12,008 --> 00:56:13,878
Anyway, the bottom line is...

856
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:17,079
you and I are both in his shadow.

857
00:56:17,278 --> 00:56:20,078
How could I have been able to pocket that much money on my own?

858
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:21,988
It's all thanks to him.

859
00:56:22,789 --> 00:56:24,959
I will stay loyal to him for the rest of my life.

860
00:56:25,358 --> 00:56:26,658
I...

861
00:56:28,158 --> 00:56:29,628
truly trust him.

862
00:56:30,658 --> 00:56:32,258
Han Gi Taek.

863
00:56:33,229 --> 00:56:36,528
You will pay for that 27 million dollars.

864
00:56:39,738 --> 00:56:43,309
(Chairman Choi Tae Guk)

865
00:56:45,809 --> 00:56:46,838
Yes.

866
00:56:47,408 --> 00:56:48,809
How are you feeling?

867
00:56:50,508 --> 00:56:52,349
I'm pretty good.

868
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:54,889
It's like my vision has cleared up,

869
00:56:55,218 --> 00:56:58,059
and my hearing has improved. It's not bad.

870
00:56:58,559 --> 00:56:59,959
I see. I'm glad.

871
00:57:00,189 --> 00:57:01,189
Yes.

872
00:57:02,658 --> 00:57:03,927
Me too.

873
00:57:03,928 --> 00:57:05,628
(Oh Soo Jae)

874
00:58:14,968 --> 00:58:16,329
Had I known,

875
00:58:17,698 --> 00:58:19,539
I would have worn a better one.

876
00:58:29,749 --> 00:58:31,048
Let's go to my house.

877
00:58:32,678 --> 00:58:34,119
You're not safe here.

878
00:59:00,209 --> 00:59:01,579
I'm hungry.

879
00:59:18,459 --> 00:59:21,399
(Why Her?)

880
00:59:41,488 --> 00:59:42,588
Three.

881
00:59:44,249 --> 00:59:46,858
Professor Oh is staying at your house? Really?

882
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:49,757
Just until she finishes renovating her building.

883
00:59:49,758 --> 00:59:51,598
But still. You're staying at your student's house?

884
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:52,998
A guy student at that too.

885
00:59:52,999 --> 00:59:54,357
I moved back in with my father.

886
00:59:54,358 --> 00:59:56,697
He wants to work as your intern.

887
00:59:56,698 --> 00:59:59,169
I'll come to work starting next week, Ms. Oh.

888
00:59:59,399 --> 01:00:02,907
Ten years ago, I did exactly what you told me to do.

889
01:00:02,908 --> 01:00:05,708
Don't you remember how thorough I was?

890
01:00:05,709 --> 01:00:08,108
Why do you want them to be ruined?

891
01:00:08,209 --> 01:00:09,308
Ever since ten years ago.

892
01:00:09,309 --> 01:00:11,818
Only you tell me what you want, Chairman Choi. So what is it?
