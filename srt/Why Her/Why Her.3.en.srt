4
00:00:18,428 --> 00:00:20,126
I love you guys.

5
00:00:20,127 --> 00:00:21,297
I'll come here every day.

6
00:00:21,427 --> 00:00:23,667
You got a professor kicked out as soon as you entered law school.

7
00:00:23,668 --> 00:00:25,037
You guys are so impressive.

8
00:00:26,337 --> 00:00:28,266
Especially you.

9
00:00:28,267 --> 00:00:29,567
Thank you.

10
00:00:32,438 --> 00:00:34,106
- Today, it's on me. - What?

11
00:00:34,107 --> 00:00:37,146
We'll get everything on the menu.

12
00:00:37,147 --> 00:00:38,778
- For real? - Okay, you got it.

13
00:00:39,177 --> 00:00:40,947
Wait, they'll actually make everything on the menu.

14
00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:43,347
It's fine. My investments have been doing well these days.

15
00:00:43,348 --> 00:00:44,917
I'm made of money.

16
00:00:44,918 --> 00:00:48,487
Nice! Then here's to Group Eight!

17
00:00:48,488 --> 00:00:50,357
- Cheers! - Cheers!

18
00:01:02,668 --> 00:01:04,778
I didn't do it because I liked Se Ryeon.

19
00:01:05,037 --> 00:01:06,378
I like you, Professor.

20
00:01:22,828 --> 00:01:24,057
What's up, quack?

21
00:01:24,628 --> 00:01:25,997
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

22
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:27,727
Come over, quick. I'm going to grill some meat.

23
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:29,328
I'm having dinner now.

24
00:01:29,427 --> 00:01:32,396
Whatever. I bet you're just having some bread or cup noodles.

25
00:01:32,397 --> 00:01:35,237
Just hurry over now. I bought Hanwoo beef, the prime grade.

26
00:01:35,238 --> 00:01:36,867
I bought beef for a change.

27
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:39,107
I'll pass. I feel lazy today.

28
00:01:39,108 --> 00:01:40,908
You can never feel too lazy to eat beef.

29
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:42,608
You're being disrespectful to cows.

30
00:01:44,878 --> 00:01:46,048
What about you, then?

31
00:01:46,447 --> 00:01:48,987
You'll grill prime-grade beef to show respect to cows?

32
00:01:48,988 --> 00:01:52,487
That's right. Nothing makes you happier than eating good food.

33
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:54,658
Poor you. You don't know the joy of eating.

34
00:01:55,087 --> 00:01:58,196
What? What are you doing? Are you drinking alone?

35
00:01:58,197 --> 00:02:00,257
Look at you, quack. You have impeccable hearing.

36
00:02:00,998 --> 00:02:03,726
Hey, I told you not to drink solo. Your arrhythmia will get worse!

37
00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:05,238
Do you want to turn into an alcoholic?

38
00:02:06,337 --> 00:02:07,638
Whatever, bye.

39
00:02:17,978 --> 00:02:21,186
A TK lawyer is joining? That's pretty cool.

40
00:02:21,187 --> 00:02:24,557
I thought Professor Jung Hee Young was taking the director position.

41
00:02:24,818 --> 00:02:26,788
By the way, how did those guys join the team?

42
00:02:26,858 --> 00:02:29,327
When did they pick the team members?

43
00:02:29,328 --> 00:02:30,857
I don't recall seeing an open call for it.

44
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:33,457
They already had certain students in mind? That's not fair.

45
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,228
The students...

46
00:02:35,397 --> 00:02:38,567
who actively participated in solving the recent sexual...

47
00:02:38,568 --> 00:02:40,297
and physical assault case involving a professor...

48
00:02:40,298 --> 00:02:42,507
were invited to join the first batch of the team.

49
00:02:42,508 --> 00:02:43,707
(Launch of Legal Clinic Center)

50
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,877
If you stepped in and tried to help, you wouldn't be saying it's unfair.

51
00:02:49,747 --> 00:02:51,948
Let's go. Darn it.

(Director Oh Soo Jae)

53
00:03:11,897 --> 00:03:13,768
They can't just notify us like this all of a sudden.

54
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:16,538
Are we not allowed to have an opinion?

55
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,277
But "free legal services"?

56
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:20,906
How exactly are we going to do that?

57
00:03:20,907 --> 00:03:23,247
Right, we can't.

58
00:03:23,647 --> 00:03:26,077
So we can just take it easy and hang out.

59
00:03:26,078 --> 00:03:27,346
Will they let us hang out and do nothing?

60
00:03:27,347 --> 00:03:28,918
Nothing comes for free in life.

61
00:03:29,048 --> 00:03:30,888
Free legal services...

62
00:03:31,048 --> 00:03:32,687
It will be nice if we can manage.

63
00:03:34,488 --> 00:03:36,388
I'm glad to hear that you think it'll be nice.

64
00:03:39,527 --> 00:03:40,527
Oh, boy.

65
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:44,768
I picked you guys.

66
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:48,267
Do any of you not want to be here?

67
00:03:48,268 --> 00:03:49,268
Oh.

68
00:03:54,008 --> 00:03:57,247
No, it's not true. I'm truly honoured to be here, sir.

69
00:03:57,578 --> 00:03:58,717
I'll do my best.

70

My gosh, I'm sorry I'm late.

71

I'm guest lawyer Song Mi Rim.

72
00:04:08,557 --> 00:04:10,526
I'll do a good job, sir.

73
00:04:10,527 --> 00:04:11,798

83

Don't touch me!

84
00:04:49,397 --> 00:04:50,797
I'll sue you for sexual harassment.

85

86

95
00:05:27,907 --> 00:05:30,707
Look, I understand how devastated you must be.

96
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:31,976
But you can't do this here.

97
00:05:31,977 --> 00:05:33,508
You think you know how I feel?

98
00:05:34,008 --> 00:05:35,677
Did you also lose your sister overnight?

99
00:05:35,678 --> 00:05:37,147
Is that why you're saying you understand?

100
00:05:37,347 --> 00:05:38,577
No, it's not that.

101
00:05:38,578 --> 00:05:39,818
What is your name?

102
00:05:42,618 --> 00:05:44,018
I'm Park Ji Young. Why?

103
00:05:45,258 --> 00:05:46,517
Park Ji Young?

104
00:05:46,518 --> 00:05:47,557
Yes, Park Ji Young.

105
00:05:47,558 --> 00:05:49,458
Park So Young, the woman you drove to suicide, is my sister.

106
00:05:53,297 --> 00:05:55,727
Did you know what your sister did to earn a living?

107
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:59,368
Your incompetent parents probably never asked her...

108
00:05:59,438 --> 00:06:01,037
what she was doing to make money...

109
00:06:01,938 --> 00:06:03,938
and how she earned the money she gave them.

110
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:06,938
And I bet you were excited whenever your sister gave you money.

111
00:06:07,378 --> 00:06:10,777
You, your mom and dad.

112
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:15,018
To your sister, you were all nothing but a burden.

113
00:06:16,547 --> 00:06:18,286
All just sitting there with your mouths wide open,

114
00:06:18,287 --> 00:06:20,716
waiting for her to spoon-feed you.

115
00:06:20,717 --> 00:06:22,928
You were just a heavy, good-for-nothing burden.

116
00:06:31,568 --> 00:06:32,868
Listen carefully, Park Ji Young.

117
00:06:33,438 --> 00:06:35,667
It is not my fault that your sister died.

118
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,638
It's your family's fault.

119
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:43,508
Let's go, ma'am.

120
00:06:48,748 --> 00:06:51,618
Don't be ridiculous! You killed my sister.

121
00:06:52,417 --> 00:06:54,118
It is your fault that my sister died!

122
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,157
Had it not been for you, my sister wouldn't have died.

123
00:07:00,227 --> 00:07:02,797
Where is Professor Oh? Step aside.

124
00:07:02,868 --> 00:07:05,268
What's with you guys? Step aside!

125
00:07:05,537 --> 00:07:08,138
Hey! What is going on?

126
00:07:08,837 --> 00:07:10,667
Time is precious. Don't waste it like this.

127
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:13,477
You're being foolish.

128
00:07:20,378 --> 00:07:21,647
I have proof!

129
00:07:21,987 --> 00:07:24,018
I can prove that you killed my sister!

130
00:07:24,787 --> 00:07:26,318
I have evidence!

I bet TK got everything taken down.

They're certainly capable of it.

You said you knew the industry well.

Is it true that Park Ji Young's sister died because of Professor Oh?

138
00:07:46,578 --> 00:07:48,307
Is that why she didn't get the managing partner position...

139
00:07:48,308 --> 00:07:49,448
and came here?

140

In the rooftop garden, Park So Young and Soo Jae...

164
00:09:32,178 --> 00:09:33,677
Yes, I watched it. What about it?

165

Well, it makes it look like...

166
00:09:35,887 --> 00:09:38,157
Soo Jae did something to that woman.

167
00:09:38,158 --> 00:09:39,756
And all the comments say Soo Jae killed her.

168
00:09:39,757 --> 00:09:41,827
I do not think it's a negligible issue, Father.

169
00:09:41,828 --> 00:09:43,158
It is.

170
00:09:44,328 --> 00:09:46,357
Why does it even matter to you?

171
00:09:47,898 --> 00:09:50,267
Don't you know what you should be focusing on right now?

172
00:09:52,938 --> 00:09:56,367
How much of Hansu Bio's documents have you retrieved from Soo Jae?

173
00:09:58,237 --> 00:09:59,877
Have you even skimmed through the first page?

174
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:04,148
Go do your work.

175
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,188
Of course, Soo Jae is not a murderer.

176
00:10:17,288 --> 00:10:18,898
And it has been concluded as suicide.

177
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:22,597
But if people watch the video,

178
00:10:22,698 --> 00:10:26,237
they'll see that she was with Park So Young in the rooftop garden.

179
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:28,707
And they'll think, "Oh Soo Jae drove her to suicide..."

180
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,438
"and made her jump to her death."

181
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:32,537
"But she's a law professor now?"

182
00:10:32,538 --> 00:10:34,476
"And she's the director of the school's legal clinic?"

183
00:10:34,477 --> 00:10:36,877
Naturally, that will be everyone's reaction.

184
00:10:37,148 --> 00:10:40,247
So please, sir. It is unfortunate,

185
00:10:40,347 --> 00:10:42,987
but I suggest you remove Soo Jae from the director position.

186
00:10:43,148 --> 00:10:47,117
She had to give up on the managing partner position because of it,

187
00:10:47,658 --> 00:10:49,757
so I think she'll be more determined to do a good job...

188
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,058
as the director of our Legal Clinic Center.

189
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,467
I doubt that video will cause any trouble for us,

190
00:10:56,497 --> 00:10:59,766
but if people suspect Soo Jae or try to shake her up,

191
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:01,867
I trust that you'll take care of it.

192
00:12:58,517 --> 00:13:00,857
- Ms. Park So Young. - What?

193
00:13:02,928 --> 00:13:04,757
Why are you here? How did you find me here?

194
00:13:16,168 --> 00:13:17,808
What are you still doing here?

195
00:13:19,877 --> 00:13:21,278
How did you get in here?

196
00:13:22,548 --> 00:13:23,877
I'm here to kill myself.

197
00:13:26,217 --> 00:13:28,987
Because of you, people think I'm a gold digger.

198
00:13:30,788 --> 00:13:32,918
I've been wronged, so I'm going to kill myself here.

199
00:13:35,058 --> 00:13:38,028
That way, the whole world will know that I died because of you.

200
00:13:39,328 --> 00:13:40,398
No.

201
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:44,028
You're not here to die.

202
00:13:47,737 --> 00:13:49,668
You came here to meet someone. Who? Tell me.

203
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,178
Why are you really here?

204
00:13:57,778 --> 00:13:58,877
Who is it?

205
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:01,418
Who called you here?

206
00:14:01,818 --> 00:14:03,188
No one.

207
00:14:03,517 --> 00:14:06,517
Someone called you here.

208
00:14:07,757 --> 00:14:08,857
So, tell me.

209
00:14:09,727 --> 00:14:11,528
Only then can I help you.

210
00:14:14,257 --> 00:14:15,898
Who are you to offer help to me?

211
00:14:18,298 --> 00:14:21,237
Even my own parents never once helped me.

212
00:14:23,107 --> 00:14:25,538
You'll help me after accusing me of being a gold digger?

213
00:14:27,808 --> 00:14:29,448
It's what everyone says.

214
00:14:31,648 --> 00:14:33,517
At first, they all talk like they'd do anything for me.

215
00:14:35,188 --> 00:14:36,288
But in the end,

216
00:14:39,387 --> 00:14:41,188
they just use me and ditch me.

217
00:14:43,127 --> 00:14:46,596
If you don't need my help, I can at least provide some insight...

218
00:14:46,597 --> 00:14:48,798
so you can judge whether or not you're being used again.

219
00:14:50,597 --> 00:14:51,767
So, tell me.

220
00:14:52,668 --> 00:14:53,737
Who is it?

221
00:14:54,497 --> 00:14:55,737
Who called you here?

222
00:15:11,418 --> 00:15:13,288
Who are you to judge?

223
00:15:15,017 --> 00:15:16,587
Who are you...

224
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:20,658
to judge my life?

225
00:15:21,627 --> 00:15:23,127
Who do you think you are?

226
00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:25,867
Who do you think you are?

227
00:15:45,418 --> 00:15:47,256
(Did you watch her interview? She's a psychopath.)

228
00:15:47,257 --> 00:15:48,657
(She's the director of a legal clinic?)

229
00:15:48,658 --> 00:15:50,188
(She should be fired as an adjunct professor too.)

230
00:15:57,528 --> 00:16:01,798
(Professor Oh Soo Jae)

231
00:16:07,237 --> 00:16:09,648
(Professor Oh Soo Jae)

232
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:11,278
Hey, are you okay?

233
00:16:12,117 --> 00:16:13,148
Yes.

234
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,987
It's no big deal, right? It has nothing to do with her death.

235
00:16:16,887 --> 00:16:18,386
Just because you met her before she died,

236
00:16:18,387 --> 00:16:19,756
it doesn't mean it's your fault.

237
00:16:19,757 --> 00:16:21,158
Hey, don't worry. Don't be scared.

238
00:16:21,688 --> 00:16:23,487
I'm not scared.

239
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:27,198
Right, who am I worried about? I should worry about myself first.

240
00:16:27,898 --> 00:16:29,367
I have a mountain of debt.

241
00:16:30,668 --> 00:16:34,337
Hey, look. Look at this!

242
00:16:34,497 --> 00:16:37,908
Lawyer Oh Soo Jae, who lives here, is my daughter.

243
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:40,707
I understand, but we're not allowed to let anyone enter...

244
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,476
without the residents' confirmation.

245
00:16:43,477 --> 00:16:47,418
Look, I'm her mother.

246
00:16:47,477 --> 00:16:50,648
I am Lawyer Oh Soo Jae's mom!

247
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,658
What can you do?

248
00:16:54,418 --> 00:16:56,458
You have to help your brothers.

249
00:16:57,028 --> 00:16:59,256
Your brothers had to serve jail time because of you.

250
00:16:59,257 --> 00:17:01,727
You need to help them get back on their feet.

251
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:06,096
They went to jail because of what they did, not because of me.

252
00:17:06,097 --> 00:17:07,897
Had you represented them, they could've avoided jail time!

253
00:17:07,898 --> 00:17:10,437
Don't forget that I got you out when you nearly ended up in jail too!

254
00:17:10,438 --> 00:17:13,107
How could you be so spiteful and heartless?

255
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:14,377
Should I remind you how much...

256
00:17:14,378 --> 00:17:17,006
your spiteful, heartless daughter has lost because of you three?

257
00:17:17,007 --> 00:17:19,517
Come on, Soo Jae. We know.

258
00:17:19,777 --> 00:17:23,188
Your big brother here knows that you went through so much because of us.

259
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,287
Shut your mouth.

260
00:17:26,057 --> 00:17:27,588
That's enough.

261
00:17:28,727 --> 00:17:31,928
I heard you bought the building where your dad's office used to be.

262
00:17:32,598 --> 00:17:35,226
- Is it true? - Why didn't you tell us?

263
00:17:35,227 --> 00:17:37,128
Hey, it's not like we'll take it away from you.

264
00:17:37,227 --> 00:17:40,066
Just open a convenience store and a billiard hall for us.

265
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:43,037
Billiard hall, my foot! That's not going to make us money!

266
00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:45,807
We should open a café.

267
00:17:46,138 --> 00:17:47,678
- Oh! - A café?

268
00:17:49,247 --> 00:17:50,277
Fine.

269
00:17:50,408 --> 00:17:52,877
Get a 100,000-dollar life insurance policy on yourselves...

270
00:17:52,878 --> 00:17:54,117
and bring me the contract.

271
00:17:54,118 --> 00:17:55,648
With me as the beneficiary.

272
00:17:56,688 --> 00:17:58,517
You spiteful brat.

273
00:17:58,688 --> 00:18:01,286
Are you saying you want us to die if we can't pay you back?

274
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:04,658
What? Is that really want you meant?

275
00:18:04,757 --> 00:18:06,556
What's with you, seriously?

276
00:18:06,557 --> 00:18:09,428
This is why that video calling you a murderer is going viral.

277
00:18:09,628 --> 00:18:11,566
Everyone says you're a murderer.

278
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:13,296
Some even say you pushed that woman.

279
00:18:13,297 --> 00:18:15,098
What is this about?

280
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:19,208
Hey, is this true? Did you really kill someone?

281
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:22,507
Does that mean you'll be disbarred?

282
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:25,477
You can't make money anymore.

283
00:18:26,247 --> 00:18:28,317
That's why you asked us to get insurance.

284
00:18:28,448 --> 00:18:30,388
Get insurance and bring me the policies.

285
00:18:31,418 --> 00:18:33,087
Then I'll open a convenience store, billiard hall, café...

286
00:18:33,088 --> 00:18:34,217
Whatever you want.

287
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:36,188
Gosh, you little...

288
00:18:36,987 --> 00:18:39,326
Hey, let's go. Mom, come on.

289
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,658
What are you waiting for, Mom? Come on. Let's go!

290
00:18:41,727 --> 00:18:42,797
Come on.

291
00:18:43,128 --> 00:18:44,567
What is going on?

292
00:18:44,827 --> 00:18:47,337
Did you really kill someone? Hey, answer me!

293
00:18:47,338 --> 00:18:50,368
We won't be visiting you if you end up in jail.

294
00:18:58,977 --> 00:19:00,378
It's me, Gong Chan.

295
00:19:00,477 --> 00:19:02,648
Professor Oh, are you all right?

296
00:19:18,327 --> 00:19:20,898
- What is this? - My gosh.

297
00:19:21,398 --> 00:19:22,668
- Look. - What's this about?

298
00:19:22,807 --> 00:19:25,378
(Is Oh Soo Jae a murderer?)

299
00:19:30,077 --> 00:19:31,977
(Is Oh Soo Jae a murderer?)

300
00:19:39,658 --> 00:19:40,717
(Is Oh Soo Jae a murderer?)

301
00:19:41,118 --> 00:19:43,658
The Criminal Code of Korea does not deem suicide punishable.

302
00:19:44,428 --> 00:19:45,797
About a month ago,

303
00:19:46,827 --> 00:19:49,667
a woman fell to her death from a law firm building.

304
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:51,296
(Instigating or aiding and abetting suicide)

305
00:19:51,297 --> 00:19:52,938
(Do Not Enter, Under Investigation)

306
00:19:54,997 --> 00:19:57,837
She claimed that she was raped by a politician.

307
00:19:57,838 --> 00:19:59,506
- My gosh. - This is nuts.

308
00:19:59,507 --> 00:20:02,178
And the politician hired a lawyer at the firm to handle the case.

309
00:20:02,408 --> 00:20:05,077
The lawyer and the woman met in a meeting room at the firm.

310
00:20:06,378 --> 00:20:07,477
And that night,

311
00:20:07,878 --> 00:20:10,588
the woman fell from the rooftop garden and died.

312
00:20:10,848 --> 00:20:13,087
Coincidentally, the lawyer was leaving work for the day...

313
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:14,858
the moment she fell.

314
00:20:15,188 --> 00:20:17,188
As soon as the lawyer left the building,

315
00:20:17,327 --> 00:20:19,428
she witnessed the fall.

316
00:20:21,997 --> 00:20:24,027
But right before the woman fell,

317
00:20:25,398 --> 00:20:27,537
the lawyer saw her in the rooftop garden.

318
00:20:41,418 --> 00:20:42,517
- What? - What is that?

319
00:20:43,148 --> 00:20:45,047
Instigating or aiding and abetting suicide.

320
00:20:45,757 --> 00:20:48,858
Article 252.2 of the Criminal Code states that a person...

321
00:20:49,388 --> 00:20:52,597
who instigates or aids and abets another to commit suicide...

322
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:55,458
shall be punished by imprisonment for at least 1 year up to 10 years.

323
00:20:57,698 --> 00:21:00,537
Can the lawyer be charged with instigating or abetting suicide?

324
00:21:02,237 --> 00:21:04,536
Aiding suicide...

325
00:21:04,537 --> 00:21:07,707
can be considered an infringement on the right to life.

326
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,046
If the lawyer...

327
00:21:09,047 --> 00:21:12,717
didn't actively try to get that woman out of that place,

328
00:21:12,817 --> 00:21:16,418
I think it could be considered aiding and abetting suicide.

329
00:21:18,088 --> 00:21:21,188
What's the difference between aiding and abetting?

330
00:21:21,287 --> 00:21:24,027
You can search online or check your textbooks if you're not sure.

331
00:21:26,698 --> 00:21:29,167
Abetting suicide means persuading someone to commit suicide...

332
00:21:29,168 --> 00:21:30,967
when they didn't have the desire to do so.

333
00:21:30,997 --> 00:21:32,337
Aiding suicide means...

334
00:21:32,338 --> 00:21:34,937
helping someone who has already decided...

335
00:21:34,938 --> 00:21:36,837
to commit suicide to do so more easily.

336
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:38,266
This can be done in various ways,

337
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:41,007
including all physical and psychological actions.

338
00:21:43,878 --> 00:21:46,378
Then which of the two does that lawyer's crime fall under?

339
00:21:48,178 --> 00:21:50,817
Wouldn't it be aiding suicide?

340
00:21:51,487 --> 00:21:53,986
The fact that the woman went up to the rooftop garden...

341
00:21:53,987 --> 00:21:55,987
means she had already decided to commit suicide,

342
00:21:56,158 --> 00:21:59,557
and the lawyer's actions could be seen as pushing her along.

343
00:21:59,797 --> 00:22:02,098
So I think it would be considered aiding suicide.

344
00:22:02,227 --> 00:22:04,628
Couldn't it also be considered abetting suicide?

345
00:22:05,868 --> 00:22:07,466
It could be.

346
00:22:07,467 --> 00:22:10,437
If that woman didn't want to commit suicide before...

347
00:22:10,438 --> 00:22:13,477
but only did so because of what the lawyer said to her,

348
00:22:13,577 --> 00:22:16,648
couldn't it also be seen as abetting suicide?

349
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,247
How can the lawyer plead innocent?

350
00:22:22,987 --> 00:22:25,657
It's not clear what conversation the lawyer had with the woman.

351
00:22:25,658 --> 00:22:27,716
Only the two can know if their conversation...

352
00:22:27,717 --> 00:22:30,888
aided in the woman's suicide.

353
00:22:31,487 --> 00:22:33,057
So what did you say...

354
00:22:39,438 --> 00:22:40,537
Oh, it's nothing.

355
00:22:44,807 --> 00:22:47,678
Don't we first need to determine...

356
00:22:48,077 --> 00:22:49,746
whether the woman actually went to the rooftop garden...

357
00:22:49,747 --> 00:22:51,577
to commit suicide...

358
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:53,948
or if she went there for something else?

359
00:22:55,077 --> 00:22:57,387
The police report said there was no will.

360
00:22:57,388 --> 00:22:59,587
If there's not enough evidence to show that it's suicide...

361
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:02,217
But it's not homicide, right?

362
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,427
It's not like someone pushed her.

363
00:23:04,428 --> 00:23:06,658
Even if we consider homicide,

364
00:23:06,898 --> 00:23:08,358
it's definitely not the lawyer.

365
00:23:09,067 --> 00:23:10,627
The lawyer was exiting the front door of the building...

366
00:23:10,628 --> 00:23:13,168
when the woman fell.

367
00:23:13,297 --> 00:23:14,368
That means...

368
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:18,438
you're definitely not the culprit.

369
00:23:19,108 --> 00:23:21,306
- What is he saying? - Gosh.

370
00:23:21,307 --> 00:23:22,477
What's wrong with him?

371
00:23:25,178 --> 00:23:27,348
Don't worry too much about the video.

372
00:23:28,378 --> 00:23:29,918
It's not your fault.

373
00:24:08,817 --> 00:24:11,027
- Oh, it's raining. - You're right.

374
00:24:39,517 --> 00:24:40,688
Take my umbrella.

375
00:24:42,257 --> 00:24:45,327
It would've been nice if I had a prettier one.

376
00:24:57,237 --> 00:24:58,267
Right.

377
00:24:59,237 --> 00:25:01,277
Make sure to tie it after you fold the umbrella.

378
00:25:01,408 --> 00:25:02,507
But wait...

Goodness. It's pouring.

382
00:25:43,648 --> 00:25:45,817
- I hope he took an umbrella... - Hey, quick. Open the door.

384
00:26:01,297 --> 00:26:02,338
Goodness.

385
00:26:27,658 --> 00:26:28,727
There.

386
00:26:28,898 --> 00:26:31,027
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

387
00:26:31,098 --> 00:26:34,638
You should eat even when you're busy.

388
00:26:35,168 --> 00:26:36,438
It's on the house.

389
00:26:36,537 --> 00:26:40,077
You just have to seem like you're really enjoying it.

390
00:26:40,378 --> 00:26:43,507
Right? You have to look like you may die because it's so tasty.

391
00:26:46,277 --> 00:26:48,246

(Chairman Choi Tae Guk)

399
00:27:55,987 --> 00:27:57,787
Big News, Ms. Oh. Look at the tabloids.

400
00:27:58,188 --> 00:28:00,316
A, son of the owner of a law firm, B, son of a company chairman,

401
00:28:00,317 --> 00:28:02,387
C, son of a powerful politician. They're involved in a drug scandal.

402
00:28:02,388 --> 00:28:04,326
The three have been close friends since high school.

403
00:28:04,327 --> 00:28:06,556
They recently hosted drug parties with women in their twenties...

404
00:28:06,557 --> 00:28:09,198
at a club in Gangnam, and they're also suspected of solicitation.

405
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:12,398
It went viral two hours ago. Their personal information is...

406
00:28:14,497 --> 00:28:16,507
I heard Chairman Choi is enraged.

407
00:28:19,737 --> 00:28:20,878
I'll be back.

408
00:28:24,777 --> 00:28:27,647
They should clean up their own mess.

409
00:28:27,648 --> 00:28:29,347
Why do they always ask Ms. Oh...

410
00:28:29,348 --> 00:28:30,986
Why? What's wrong?

411
00:28:30,987 --> 00:28:33,287
Is Ms. Oh going to clean up someone's mess? Whose is it?

412
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:35,717
I don't know whose mess...

413
00:28:36,628 --> 00:28:37,658
Ms. Song...

414
00:28:38,827 --> 00:28:40,957
The Western District Prosecutors' Office is launching...

415
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:42,227
a grand-scale investigation into this drug scandal.

416
00:28:42,698 --> 00:28:44,898
To deal with the controversy regarding poor investigations,

417
00:28:45,168 --> 00:28:46,938
the chief prosecutor is running the investigation.

418
00:28:50,338 --> 00:28:51,438
Handle the press.

419
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:53,708
Block all related articles from being posted online. And get Ju Wan.

420
00:28:53,807 --> 00:28:55,077
Yes, sir.

421
00:29:00,848 --> 00:29:01,977
Have a seat.

422
00:29:07,158 --> 00:29:08,217
Father.

423
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:17,297
Father, let me explain.

424
00:29:18,428 --> 00:29:21,167
It's true that I drank, but I swear. The drugs...

425
00:29:21,168 --> 00:29:23,368
I was so drunk.

426
00:29:23,838 --> 00:29:25,908
I didn't realize that they put something in my drink...

427
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:35,777
You little...

428
00:29:37,418 --> 00:29:38,448
Again?

429
00:29:40,188 --> 00:29:41,458
No, Father.

430
00:29:43,027 --> 00:29:46,297
It's true I was with them, but I swear it's not true.

431
00:29:46,428 --> 00:29:47,428
Get out!

432
00:30:00,277 --> 00:30:02,908
Go meet Prosecutor Hyun at the Western Office and deal with this.

433
00:30:04,448 --> 00:30:06,077
I don't feel like it, Chairman Choi.

434
00:30:08,118 --> 00:30:10,418
I promised myself something after Park So Young died.

435
00:30:12,188 --> 00:30:14,918
Don't even touch a case that doesn't feel good.

436
00:30:16,658 --> 00:30:18,487
It doesn't feel good...

437
00:30:20,358 --> 00:30:21,698
to help Managing Partner Choi.

438
00:30:22,628 --> 00:30:24,168
I apologize, Chairman Choi.

439
00:30:24,327 --> 00:30:25,527
I saw...

440
00:30:27,598 --> 00:30:30,037
that video too. You must've wanted to kill her.

441
00:30:32,007 --> 00:30:35,408
The fact that your boyfriend, An Kang Won, was involved...

442
00:30:37,378 --> 00:30:39,277
with a girl like that must've made you want to kill her.

443
00:30:41,118 --> 00:30:43,388
You gave me the case because you knew.

444
00:30:43,517 --> 00:30:45,486
Because you would deal with it better than anyone.

445
00:30:45,487 --> 00:30:47,286
Whether it was the betrayal you felt from An Kang Won...

446
00:30:47,287 --> 00:30:49,317
or the hate you felt towards Park So Young,

447
00:30:49,688 --> 00:30:52,628
I knew your feelings would push you to deal with the case effectively.

448
00:30:53,598 --> 00:30:55,727
Of course, who knew she would die like that...

449
00:30:59,227 --> 00:31:00,598
So, did you kill her?

450
00:31:04,338 --> 00:31:06,737
What importance does An Kang Won have in my life?

451
00:31:08,537 --> 00:31:11,507
I don't risk my life for something so insignificant.

452
00:31:13,418 --> 00:31:15,348
Why didn't you just say so?

453
00:31:16,247 --> 00:31:19,717
I know you're dating An Kang Won, so take care of it.

454
00:31:20,487 --> 00:31:22,458
Why didn't you just say that?

455
00:31:24,057 --> 00:31:26,727
Nothing's as powerful as being honest.

456
00:31:28,327 --> 00:31:30,067
Please go see Chief Prosecutor Hyun.

457
00:31:31,668 --> 00:31:33,997
That's my honest request as a father.

458
00:31:43,908 --> 00:31:45,007
I'll do it.

459
00:31:46,148 --> 00:31:48,817
But don't think that I'm doing it for you.

460
00:31:50,747 --> 00:31:52,918
It's also certainly not for Managing Partner Choi.

461
00:31:54,717 --> 00:31:57,588
I'm doing it because...

462
00:31:58,428 --> 00:32:00,128
I don't want TK Law Firm's image to be dirtied.

463
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:03,627
You think you and TK Law Firm are one and the same.

464
00:32:03,628 --> 00:32:04,827
Is that why?

465
00:32:27,588 --> 00:32:29,658
- Mr. Ha. - Oh, yes.

466
00:32:32,088 --> 00:32:35,398
So, where were you...

467
00:32:35,898 --> 00:32:38,267
the night that Park So Young died?

468
00:32:39,368 --> 00:32:41,737
I drove Chairman Choi home,

469
00:32:41,967 --> 00:32:43,938
and then I came back to the office because I had some work left.

470
00:32:45,067 --> 00:32:49,237
The maintenance team called me while I was working in the office,

471
00:32:49,378 --> 00:32:50,878
saying that a woman fell...

472
00:32:51,247 --> 00:32:53,477
and that it seemed like she fell from the rooftop garden.

473
00:32:54,217 --> 00:32:56,418
So I went straight to the rooftop garden...

474
00:32:57,448 --> 00:32:58,717
And?

475
00:32:59,217 --> 00:33:00,858
There was nothing there.

476
00:33:01,158 --> 00:33:04,286
Was there anything that Park So Young left or dropped?

477
00:33:04,287 --> 00:33:05,428
No, there wasn't.

478
00:33:05,987 --> 00:33:09,358
The police also said they didn't find anything at the scene.

479
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:13,098
- I'll be going, then. - Sure.

480
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:24,807
Look into me.

481
00:33:24,948 --> 00:33:27,847
I was on the first floor when Park So Young crashed.

482
00:33:27,848 --> 00:33:31,046
But that doesn't mean I'm cleared of aiding and abetting suicide.

483
00:33:31,047 --> 00:33:32,148
So look into it.

484
00:33:32,348 --> 00:33:35,286
If you could tell us what the intention is...

485
00:33:35,287 --> 00:33:38,458
The intention isn't important, the result is.

486
00:33:45,997 --> 00:33:47,997
I think she's trying to find something.

487
00:33:49,838 --> 00:33:51,037
What's that?

488
00:33:52,868 --> 00:33:54,007
The real culprit.

489
00:33:55,138 --> 00:33:58,507
Go to the administrative department instead of asking me.

490
00:33:58,678 --> 00:34:01,918
I told you I'll pay the bills by the end of this month.

491
00:34:02,277 --> 00:34:04,486
Do you really have to bring that up in front of a sick person?

492
00:34:04,487 --> 00:34:07,188
What are you up to, Ji Young? Honey!

493
00:34:08,188 --> 00:34:10,786
Get out. Why did you come here? Get out.

494
00:34:10,787 --> 00:34:12,427
What do you think you're doing, you brat?

495
00:34:12,827 --> 00:34:14,858
I can come here if I want.

496
00:34:14,997 --> 00:34:17,897
How dare you push your own father like that?

497
00:34:17,898 --> 00:34:21,097
Mom's hospital bills, the rent, my tuition,

498
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:24,668
and the money that So Young gave us. You wasted it all away gambling.

499
00:34:25,168 --> 00:34:26,636
Get out.

500
00:34:26,637 --> 00:34:29,406
Get out before I kill Mom and myself.

501
00:34:29,407 --> 00:34:31,008
This rude little...

502
00:34:31,677 --> 00:34:33,648
Look at this brat.

503
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:37,246
What? You're going to kill yourself? What?

504
00:34:37,247 --> 00:34:39,087
Sure. Go ahead.

505
00:34:39,088 --> 00:34:41,758
So Young also killed herself.

506
00:34:41,887 --> 00:34:45,528
Go ahead. Kill yourself and take your mom with you.

507
00:34:46,157 --> 00:34:47,458
How spiteful.

508
00:34:47,727 --> 00:34:49,967
What are you looking at? Get out of here.

509
00:34:49,968 --> 00:34:51,326
Is this entertaining to you?

510
00:34:51,327 --> 00:34:54,767
I'm going to light this place on fire. Leave!

511
00:34:56,267 --> 00:34:57,438
Darn it.

512
00:34:57,807 --> 00:34:59,938
Hey, do you have any money left?

513
00:35:04,508 --> 00:35:05,778
Gosh.

514
00:35:06,278 --> 00:35:09,147
You'd be so popular if you make food videos.

515
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:11,918
Wait. Don't touch it. It's all mine.

516
00:35:15,088 --> 00:35:16,458
I looked into it.

517
00:35:16,827 --> 00:35:20,398
Ms. Oh got interviewed as a witness after Park So Young died.

518
00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:22,927
- She was interviewed? - Yes.

519
00:35:23,068 --> 00:35:25,996
I heard she met Park So Young on the rooftop garden that night.

520
00:35:25,997 --> 00:35:29,967
But she fell when Ms. Oh was on the first floor.

521
00:35:29,968 --> 00:35:32,238
So there's no direct link.

522
00:35:32,438 --> 00:35:35,577
That's how they concluded it was suicide.

523
00:35:36,378 --> 00:35:37,548
Order your own food.

524
00:35:43,688 --> 00:35:44,787
What?

525
00:35:47,588 --> 00:35:48,858
Why is she in here?

526
00:35:53,557 --> 00:35:55,027
Keep a good eye out while I'm out for lunch.

527
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:57,298
Yes, sir. Have a good lunch.

528
00:36:08,738 --> 00:36:10,148
Hello.

529
00:36:11,177 --> 00:36:12,207
Who...

530
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:14,177
I'm an employee here.

531
00:36:16,017 --> 00:36:17,688
But what brings you...

532
00:36:17,847 --> 00:36:20,286
I'm working on a case involving security cameras,

533
00:36:20,287 --> 00:36:22,188
and I had some questions.

534
00:36:23,628 --> 00:36:26,758
Actually, the attorney that I'm assisting...

535
00:36:26,927 --> 00:36:29,597
is scary and weird,

536
00:36:29,798 --> 00:36:31,897
so I have a lot to research.

537
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:32,968
Oh, no.

538
00:36:33,898 --> 00:36:35,866
Sure. Ask me anything.

539
00:36:35,867 --> 00:36:37,137
Thank you.

540
00:36:37,338 --> 00:36:40,637
So there are routine maintenance days...

541
00:36:40,878 --> 00:36:44,077
in large buildings like this, right?

542
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:46,548
Yes, we...

543
00:37:06,968 --> 00:37:09,697
Chairman Choi. It seems things have been resolved nicely.

544
00:37:15,778 --> 00:37:18,076
(This is breaking news on the recent drug scandal.)

545
00:37:18,077 --> 00:37:21,346
Five people, including an actor and idol star,

546
00:37:21,347 --> 00:37:24,346
have been arrested for smuggling drugs into the country...

547
00:37:24,347 --> 00:37:26,047
and selling it to fellow celebrities.

548
00:37:26,048 --> 00:37:28,357
The Western District Prosecutors' Office that handled the case...

549
00:37:28,358 --> 00:37:30,688
- said the idol star supplied... - Turn it off.

550
00:37:32,657 --> 00:37:34,327
They centered it around the celebrities, I see.

551
00:37:36,327 --> 00:37:38,867
(Chairman Han)

552
00:37:42,068 --> 00:37:44,267
Aren't you going to answer?

553
00:37:44,537 --> 00:37:47,238
They always make my son the bad guy.

554
00:37:49,537 --> 00:37:51,378
They're only successful because of me.

555
00:37:52,177 --> 00:37:53,747
They only enjoy a lavish life because of me.

556
00:37:57,688 --> 00:37:59,387
They're so ungrateful, aren't they?

557
00:38:26,177 --> 00:38:29,447
I didn't do it. I really told them not to.

558
00:38:31,188 --> 00:38:32,447
Me neither.

559
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:36,517
Choi Ju Wan. That punk. He went all crazy by himself...

560
00:38:37,827 --> 00:38:40,358
Wait. I didn't do it, Father. I...

561
00:38:45,727 --> 00:38:46,798
Father.

562
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:50,168
Move your hand.

563
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:53,278
Move your hand!

564
00:38:57,307 --> 00:38:59,918
Father. It wasn't me. I...

565
00:39:12,727 --> 00:39:14,057
I'm sorry, Father.

566
00:39:14,597 --> 00:39:17,298
I'll never disappoint you again.

567
00:39:18,697 --> 00:39:20,537
I won't get outshine by Soo Jae.

568
00:39:20,738 --> 00:39:23,667
I'll work hard so that you can trust me and put TK Law firm...

569
00:39:23,668 --> 00:39:25,168
I like mine well-done.

570
00:39:26,137 --> 00:39:29,137
Others say steak dripping with blood is tasty,

571
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:31,547
but I hate the smell of blood more than anything else.

572
00:39:31,548 --> 00:39:33,517
I know your taste well, Chairman Choi.

573
00:39:36,318 --> 00:39:38,786
That's right. It's best to cut the steak into smaller pieces...

574
00:39:38,787 --> 00:39:41,057
and grilled each side to get rid of the smell of blood.

575
00:39:41,557 --> 00:39:42,617
Why...

576
00:39:43,557 --> 00:39:46,427
do you think I'm pursuing the sale of Hansu Bio?

577
00:39:49,327 --> 00:39:50,997
If there are things you can't have,

578
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,298
things you can't eat in one bite because they're too big,

579
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:56,238
you need to cut them into little pieces.

580
00:39:56,867 --> 00:39:59,238
and eat it one by one.

581
00:40:10,787 --> 00:40:13,958
The meat you grill is the best, Mr. Park.

582
00:40:14,157 --> 00:40:15,357
Thank you, sir.

583
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:17,358
It looks like it's pretty much done.

584
00:40:22,997 --> 00:40:26,496
The finances of Hansu Bio's subsidiaries...

585
00:40:26,497 --> 00:40:28,137
have been handled by Han Ki Taek.

586
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,367
Even though he saw his own father get pushed aside by Chairman Han

587
00:40:32,738 --> 00:40:36,778
and eventually get kicked out of the company,

588
00:40:37,947 --> 00:40:41,077
he still bowed down to Chairman Han and stayed loyal to him.

589
00:40:42,117 --> 00:40:44,117
But there's no way he was perfectly loyal.

590
00:40:45,287 --> 00:40:48,117
He must have some bad feelings towards Chairman Han.

591
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:51,287
So why do you think Chairman Han put his nephew in charge...

592
00:40:51,588 --> 00:40:55,358
of the finances instead of his own son?

593
00:40:56,528 --> 00:40:57,697
So that...

594
00:40:58,668 --> 00:41:01,968
Han Ki Taek would take the blame if any problems came up.

595
00:41:03,508 --> 00:41:04,738
That's right.

596
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:09,237
We've handled all of the lobbying, lawsuits, and other legal matters...

597
00:41:09,238 --> 00:41:11,476
for Chairman Han's business...

598
00:41:11,477 --> 00:41:13,077
for the past ten years.

599
00:41:13,378 --> 00:41:16,577
And I put Soo Jae on all of those cases.

600
00:41:18,088 --> 00:41:19,887
The reason I put Soo Jae ahead of you...

601
00:41:20,387 --> 00:41:23,358
is the same reason why Chairman Han used Han Ki Taek.

602
00:41:25,887 --> 00:41:27,697
So if there's a problem,

603
00:41:28,927 --> 00:41:31,127
Soo Jae would take the blame.

604
00:41:31,128 --> 00:41:33,438
But Soo Jae took the records related to that work.

605
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:38,468
The records that have information that Soo Jae shouldn't know...

606
00:41:39,968 --> 00:41:41,878
are in Soo Jae's hands.

607
00:41:42,807 --> 00:41:46,747
(Storage Box 1, Hansu Bio, Financial Structure)

608
00:41:57,088 --> 00:41:58,988
(Income Statement)

609
00:42:21,077 --> 00:42:22,446
Do you think...

610
00:42:22,447 --> 00:42:25,188
there will be files that could jeopardize you as well?

611
00:42:25,747 --> 00:42:28,057
Not just me. It can also jeopardize Chairman Han and Assemblyman Lee.

612
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:31,988
And TK Law Firm I treasure as much as my life.

613
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:41,697
But the world isn't all bad.

614
00:42:46,568 --> 00:42:49,407
I got my hands dirty for you.

615
00:42:49,477 --> 00:42:50,778
But I'm fine.

616
00:42:51,648 --> 00:42:54,947
I don't care if my hands get dirty. I did it for your sake.

617
00:42:56,477 --> 00:42:57,947
I can do something much worse than that.

618
00:42:59,747 --> 00:43:01,017
That's what fathers do.

619
00:43:03,588 --> 00:43:05,688
That was my path, but yours must be different.

620
00:43:06,227 --> 00:43:09,258
I still have to grovel at them.

621
00:43:09,697 --> 00:43:13,168
Those jerks, Han Dong O and Lee Si Hyuk.

622
00:43:14,168 --> 00:43:16,468
You must make them grovel at you.

623
00:43:17,438 --> 00:43:20,208
Once you get those files,

624
00:43:20,938 --> 00:43:22,577
you and I...

625
00:43:23,608 --> 00:43:26,708
won't have to grovel at them.

626
00:43:28,247 --> 00:43:29,447
Yes, Father.

627
00:43:29,778 --> 00:43:30,947
Ju Wan.

628
00:43:31,847 --> 00:43:33,318
You're my son.

629
00:43:35,758 --> 00:43:37,057
And Soo Jae...

630
00:43:39,287 --> 00:43:41,097
will be working under you.

631
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:51,367
Eat up. You must eat a lot.

632
00:43:51,668 --> 00:43:52,668
Okay.

633
00:44:18,097 --> 00:44:20,867
This has a fingerprint lock and requires multiple passcodes.

634
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,707
I don't remember seeing this that day.

635
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:25,366
Where did you find this?

636
00:44:25,367 --> 00:44:27,136
I came across this between the files in the binder.

637
00:44:27,137 --> 00:44:28,677
Between the files in the binder?

638
00:44:29,438 --> 00:44:31,307
Gosh. They were being smart.

639
00:44:31,548 --> 00:44:33,648
I couldn't see it that day.

640
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:37,187
I'll do my best to open this with my employees.

641
00:44:37,188 --> 00:44:39,117
If you can't fix it internally, stop there.

642
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,157
I don't want any outsiders on this.

643
00:44:41,657 --> 00:44:42,688
Of course, not.

644
00:44:43,988 --> 00:44:47,427
And please look into Park So Young a bit more.

645
00:44:48,197 --> 00:44:50,327
- Sure. - Please call me.

646
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:00,508
"Tell everyone to come to TK Law Firm tomorrow."

647
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,037
TK Law Firm?

648
00:45:03,238 --> 00:45:05,047
- Who texted you that? - Professor Oh.

649
00:45:05,048 --> 00:45:07,177
- What? - You guys text each other?

650
00:45:07,648 --> 00:45:11,116
When I saved her number, her profile popped up on the app.

651
00:45:11,117 --> 00:45:12,718
Wait. What's her name?

652
00:45:13,117 --> 00:45:15,516
You want to save Professor Oh's number too?

653
00:45:15,517 --> 00:45:17,628
- I'll give it to you. - Me too.

654
00:45:17,988 --> 00:45:21,028
(Soo Jae)

655
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,858
Hey, you tell them.

656
00:45:24,327 --> 00:45:26,827
- What is it? - It's 0, 1, 0...

657
00:45:35,008 --> 00:45:37,847
- Gosh. Right. - This place is cool.

658
00:45:37,977 --> 00:45:39,307
This place is pretty big.

659
00:45:40,847 --> 00:45:42,317
- Right? - Gosh.

660
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:43,417
Over here.

661
00:45:43,418 --> 00:45:45,148
- Hello. - Hello.

662
00:45:45,887 --> 00:45:47,857
This place is amazing!

663
00:45:47,858 --> 00:45:51,027
Right? I don't see Chan.

664
00:45:51,028 --> 00:45:52,656
He's on his way. Let's go inside.

665
00:45:52,657 --> 00:45:54,258
I see. This way.

666
00:46:06,338 --> 00:46:08,176
I heard Ms. Oh's students from law school came.

667
00:46:08,177 --> 00:46:09,676
After losing the managing partner title,

668
00:46:09,677 --> 00:46:10,907
she's acting like a professor.

669
00:46:11,008 --> 00:46:12,277
It would have been great...

670
00:46:12,278 --> 00:46:14,417
if the chairman fired her when Park So Young died.

671
00:46:14,418 --> 00:46:15,677
Exactly.

672
00:46:27,528 --> 00:46:29,298
This is where Park So Young fell.

673
00:46:29,958 --> 00:46:31,366
Around that time,

674
00:46:31,367 --> 00:46:32,727
I was on my way to the car at the first-floor entrance.

675
00:46:33,227 --> 00:46:34,398
What do you think now that you looked into the case?

676
00:46:34,968 --> 00:46:36,867
Am I responsible for Park So Young's death?

677
00:46:37,068 --> 00:46:39,338
Will the charge for aiding and betting suicide stick?

678
00:46:39,438 --> 00:46:41,937
Right after the incident, you were questioned by the police.

679
00:46:41,938 --> 00:46:44,508
You told the police that you met with Park So Young here.

680
00:46:45,077 --> 00:46:47,847
Why didn't you say anything when the video was released?

681
00:46:48,617 --> 00:46:50,647
Next. Right after she fell,

682
00:46:50,648 --> 00:46:52,847
people took photos. And Park Ji Young was at the scene.

683
00:46:53,858 --> 00:46:55,758
There's a photo of her leaving the basement parking lot.

684
00:47:04,168 --> 00:47:06,267
Then Park Ji Young was here?

685
00:47:07,668 --> 00:47:08,967
- Next. - The security cameras...

686
00:47:08,968 --> 00:47:10,567
were supposed to be inspected that night.

687
00:47:10,568 --> 00:47:12,237
But the cameras in the emergency staircase,

688
00:47:12,238 --> 00:47:13,567
the hallway of the chairman's office,

689
00:47:13,568 --> 00:47:14,577
and the hallway of the security office weren't turned off.

690
00:47:14,637 --> 00:47:16,677
I wasn't able to get the footage.

691
00:47:17,177 --> 00:47:20,177
But the footage is saved for up to a year in the backup drive.

692
00:47:21,017 --> 00:47:24,617
But since we confirmed that Park Ji Young was here...

693
00:47:24,818 --> 00:47:27,188
We should check where her sister had been as well.

694
00:47:27,318 --> 00:47:29,858
You know, there are times...

695
00:47:30,588 --> 00:47:33,958
a family member becomes the suspect.

696
00:47:35,398 --> 00:47:37,327
It's really awful to think about.

697
00:47:37,668 --> 00:47:42,068
But she could have been killed by her younger sister.

698
00:47:43,807 --> 00:47:46,238
I think the premise is wrong.

699
00:47:48,177 --> 00:47:50,677
Then why would she put on a protest and release the footage?

700
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:53,277
She would try to stop the case from gaining any attention.

701
00:47:53,278 --> 00:47:55,176
Right. That makes more sense.

702
00:47:55,177 --> 00:47:56,278
Park Ji Young...

703
00:47:57,247 --> 00:47:59,088
cared a lot for her sister.

704
00:48:00,148 --> 00:48:01,358
Ji Young...

705
00:48:01,557 --> 00:48:04,157
went home early on the days her sister was coming home.

706
00:48:04,727 --> 00:48:06,927
She said her sister worked at a great company...

707
00:48:07,088 --> 00:48:08,298
and earned a lot of money.

708
00:48:09,697 --> 00:48:11,497
But after her sister died,

709
00:48:11,867 --> 00:48:14,438
the kids called her sister a prostitute and a gold digger.

710
00:48:14,898 --> 00:48:16,668
They bullied her a lot for it.

711
00:48:17,938 --> 00:48:20,036
After that, she stopped coming to school.

712
00:48:20,037 --> 00:48:21,576
She was ranked fifth in school, but now,

713
00:48:21,577 --> 00:48:23,208
she's not even ranked in the top 50.

714
00:48:23,338 --> 00:48:24,907
By the way, did Ji Young...

715
00:48:25,807 --> 00:48:27,818
talk about the video?

716
00:48:28,577 --> 00:48:31,188
Did she tell you who took it and where she saved it?

717
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,157
Ji Young's sister had two phones.

718
00:48:34,418 --> 00:48:36,488
She kept one of her phones at home.

719
00:48:37,488 --> 00:48:40,286
Ji Young said she was really shocked...

720
00:48:40,287 --> 00:48:42,798
when she found it after her sister died.

721
00:48:44,168 --> 00:48:46,197
To sum it up,

722
00:48:46,597 --> 00:48:50,168
Park So Young filmed the video with her cell phone.

723
00:48:50,338 --> 00:48:53,608
And the footage was uploaded to her phone at home automatically.

724
00:48:53,668 --> 00:48:54,976
Here's what's odd.

725
00:48:54,977 --> 00:48:58,278
Park So Young's phone wasn't found at the scene.

726
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:00,817
My junior cop told me they searched everywhere...

727
00:49:00,818 --> 00:49:02,346
including the rooftop and the areas around the fall...

728
00:49:02,347 --> 00:49:04,687
and the building. They even searched the sewer.

729
00:49:04,688 --> 00:49:06,688
But they didn't find anything.

730
00:49:07,858 --> 00:49:10,057
Why did Park Ji Young come to see her sister?

731
00:49:10,827 --> 00:49:13,487
How did she know her sister was on the rooftop of this building?

732
00:49:13,488 --> 00:49:14,596
Park Ji Young had been worried...

733
00:49:14,597 --> 00:49:15,898
about her sister before the incident.

734
00:49:16,758 --> 00:49:19,167
"I'll get a lot of money soon. Let's emigrate together."

735
00:49:19,168 --> 00:49:20,537
Park So Young said things that didn't make sense.

736
00:49:21,068 --> 00:49:22,898
And she went radio silent for days too.

737
00:49:24,238 --> 00:49:26,907
So Park Ji Young decided to track her sister's phone.

738
00:49:27,108 --> 00:49:29,608
That's how she ended up here to find her sister?

739
00:49:29,938 --> 00:49:33,247
But she couldn't stop her sister.

740
00:49:35,378 --> 00:49:37,218
Park Ji Young came to school...

741
00:49:37,688 --> 00:49:39,318
to get attention.

742
00:49:40,148 --> 00:49:41,517
To get people to hear her out...

743
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:44,727
because no one would listen or believe her.

744
00:49:46,688 --> 00:49:47,927
Park Ji Young...

745
00:49:49,327 --> 00:49:51,168
is in unbearable agony right now.

746
00:49:52,668 --> 00:49:54,597
If Park So Young was murdered...

747
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,267
If you're considering that possibility,

748
00:49:57,767 --> 00:49:59,068
Park Ji Young didn't do it.

749
00:50:02,077 --> 00:50:03,277
If you wanted to get information,

750
00:50:03,278 --> 00:50:05,077
it should have gotten something I didn't know before.

751
00:50:06,847 --> 00:50:08,076
If you found Park Ji Young suspicious,

752
00:50:08,077 --> 00:50:09,718
you should've gotten solid evidence.

753
00:50:10,648 --> 00:50:12,517
If it's not Park Ji Young, who is it then?

754
00:50:12,887 --> 00:50:14,418
Why did you make us look into this?

755
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:17,827
You made us look into you.

756
00:50:18,858 --> 00:50:20,427
Are you considering the possibility...

757
00:50:21,327 --> 00:50:23,358
that this is a murder case, and there's a real culprit?

758
00:50:24,968 --> 00:50:27,028
If you're curious, find out for yourself.

759
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:09,306
Is this the best you can do? Why don't you just quit?

760
00:51:09,307 --> 00:51:11,048
What? How did this happen?

761
00:51:11,307 --> 00:51:12,778
Get me the person in charge.

762
00:51:36,168 --> 00:51:37,438
You're still here.

763
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:39,968
I had a question.

764
00:51:40,637 --> 00:51:41,637
What is it?

765
00:51:41,638 --> 00:51:44,077
When you met Park So Young on the rooftop garden,

766
00:51:44,378 --> 00:51:45,907
what did you talk about?

767
00:51:48,177 --> 00:51:51,188
Who do you think you are?

768
00:51:52,718 --> 00:51:55,718
You're right. I'm a nobody to you.

769
00:51:57,358 --> 00:51:58,458
But...

770
00:51:58,758 --> 00:52:01,557
your life and my life are valuable just like everyone else's.

771
00:52:04,267 --> 00:52:06,597
Don't sell yourself short...

772
00:52:08,697 --> 00:52:10,597
if you want other people to respect you.

773
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:16,337
Were you supposed to meet there? Or did you run into her?

774
00:52:16,338 --> 00:52:17,708
I'm curious about that too.

775
00:52:18,947 --> 00:52:20,077
I ran into her.

776
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:22,676
But I almost didn't.

777
00:52:22,677 --> 00:52:25,588
Then Park So Young could have been there to meet someone.

778
00:52:25,718 --> 00:52:27,718
Is there anyone you can think of?

779
00:52:30,358 --> 00:52:31,427
Who is he?

780
00:52:31,958 --> 00:52:33,327
You should go.

781
00:52:36,827 --> 00:52:40,168
I see. Are you one of the students in the Legal Clinic or whatever?

782
00:52:41,398 --> 00:52:44,238
How old are you? I'm Choi Ju Wan, the managing partner here.

783
00:52:44,438 --> 00:52:45,938
Do you want to work here once you graduate?

784
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,807
You asked me about my age during our first meeting.

785
00:52:52,747 --> 00:52:55,517
Unless you want to be friends, I don't want to tell you.

786
00:52:56,048 --> 00:52:57,617
Do you want to be friends?

787
00:52:57,918 --> 00:52:59,188
But I don't like you.

788
00:52:59,617 --> 00:53:01,758
- What? - An internship at this law firm?

789
00:53:02,657 --> 00:53:03,887
It's not that special.

790
00:53:04,427 --> 00:53:05,787
I don't want it at all.

791
00:53:05,927 --> 00:53:07,996
People said TK Law Firm was an incredible law firm...

792
00:53:07,997 --> 00:53:10,898
where everyone dreamed of working. So I had high hopes.

793
00:53:11,168 --> 00:53:12,567
Even my short visit here makes me wonder...

794
00:53:12,568 --> 00:53:14,197
if anyone should work here.

795
00:53:14,298 --> 00:53:16,567
And it makes me concerned about my professor's mental well-being...

796
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:18,367
for having to put up with a jerk like you.

797
00:53:19,468 --> 00:53:20,667
A jerk like me?

798
00:53:20,668 --> 00:53:22,878
Yes. You heard me.

799
00:53:25,907 --> 00:53:26,977
Jerk?

800
00:53:28,177 --> 00:53:29,548
I'll see you at school.

801
00:53:33,188 --> 00:53:35,418
Who does he think he is? Why is he so rude?

802
00:53:37,188 --> 00:53:38,588
Who are his parents?

803
00:53:39,858 --> 00:53:41,496
I guess you can only condone rude behaviours...

804
00:53:41,497 --> 00:53:43,398
from kids with rich parents.

805
00:53:43,697 --> 00:53:47,096
But it's fascinating that he's very polite to other people.

806
00:53:47,097 --> 00:53:48,367
Enough with the chitchat.

807
00:53:48,468 --> 00:53:50,568
Give me the files on Hansu Bio. You had your fun.

808
00:53:50,637 --> 00:53:52,366
Even if I gave them to you, you won't study them.

809
00:53:52,367 --> 00:53:54,977
And even if you study them, you won't be able to find a way.

810
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:58,148
Why do you want them? Why should I give them to you?

811
00:54:00,008 --> 00:54:01,077
You.

812
00:54:02,148 --> 00:54:03,718
So you were dating An Kang Won,

813
00:54:03,778 --> 00:54:05,188
but you broke up after Park So Young's case.

814
00:54:05,847 --> 00:54:07,987
Did you think he would marry you?

815
00:54:07,988 --> 00:54:10,927
Did you think his family would accept you?

816
00:54:11,188 --> 00:54:12,588
Gosh.

817
00:54:13,387 --> 00:54:15,227
Wake up, Soo Jae.

818
00:54:15,458 --> 00:54:19,027
Stop dreaming of climbing the ladder by marrying an affluent guy.

819
00:54:19,028 --> 00:54:20,267
It's breaking my heart.

820
00:54:21,997 --> 00:54:23,438
The chairman...

821
00:54:24,037 --> 00:54:27,608
must have told you to get the files no matter what it took.

822
00:54:28,738 --> 00:54:30,238
Stop trying.

823
00:54:31,947 --> 00:54:35,648
It breaks my heart to see you act like a helpless puppy.

824
00:54:35,778 --> 00:54:37,617
I'm saying this for your sake.

825
00:54:38,747 --> 00:54:40,858
Don't dismiss my request. Just hand them over.

826
00:54:41,787 --> 00:54:43,287
That will be good for everyone.

827
00:54:44,387 --> 00:54:45,427
Got it?

828
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:48,358
Seriously.

829
00:55:08,648 --> 00:55:09,677
Park Ji Young?

830
00:55:13,188 --> 00:55:16,318
Park Ji Young. You're under arrest for murdering Park So Young.

831
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:20,957
You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney.

832
00:55:20,958 --> 00:55:22,128
Understood?

833
00:55:23,497 --> 00:55:24,568
Ji Young.

834
00:55:28,298 --> 00:55:29,798
(Jungang Police Station)

835
00:55:31,008 --> 00:55:33,207
- Did you admit to the charge? - Did you really kill her?

836
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:35,777
- Did you kill your sister? - Is that true?

837
00:55:35,778 --> 00:55:37,277
- Is it true? - Why did you kill her?

838
00:55:37,278 --> 00:55:38,377
Breaking news.

839
00:55:38,378 --> 00:55:41,746
A woman in her 20s fell off the TK Law Firm building and died.

840
00:55:41,747 --> 00:55:43,977
And the suspect in the case has been apprehended by the police.

841
00:55:44,517 --> 00:55:46,988
The suspect was the victim's younger sister.

842
00:55:47,548 --> 00:55:50,488
Park was arrested for murdering her older sister.

843
00:55:50,818 --> 00:55:52,827
The police are questioning her now.

844
00:55:53,057 --> 00:55:55,427
An arrest warrant will be issued soon.

845
00:55:55,958 --> 00:55:58,227
The 18-year-old suspect...

846
00:55:58,468 --> 00:56:01,997
is pleading the Fifth from our sources.

847
00:56:19,347 --> 00:56:20,918
You didn't do it, right?

848
00:56:23,918 --> 00:56:25,327
Park Ji Young was arrested.

849
00:56:26,327 --> 00:56:28,958
Did you do that? You didn't, right?

850
00:56:30,528 --> 00:56:32,367
You didn't hand over what we found out...

851
00:56:33,197 --> 00:56:34,837
to the police, right?

852
00:56:34,838 --> 00:56:36,697
You're asking the wrong questions.

853
00:56:37,267 --> 00:56:40,168
You should ask me why she was arrested without a warrant.

854
00:56:41,077 --> 00:56:43,878
Asking me if I handed over your findings to the police...

855
00:56:44,708 --> 00:56:45,877
is quite rude.

856
00:56:45,878 --> 00:56:48,847
I thought you wanted to find the real culprit.

857
00:56:49,278 --> 00:56:52,088
When you told us to look into you.

858
00:56:52,447 --> 00:56:54,048
When you were talking to us on the rooftop garden,

859
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:56,688
I only looked at you.

860
00:56:57,827 --> 00:56:59,657
You were deep in thought.

861
00:57:01,497 --> 00:57:04,327
And you were definitely a bit surprised and shaken.

862
00:57:05,597 --> 00:57:07,168
But I trust you...

863
00:57:08,037 --> 00:57:09,437
that you must have your reasons.

864
00:57:09,438 --> 00:57:10,898
That doesn't make sense.

865
00:57:11,907 --> 00:57:13,837
Why did you ask me that when you say you trusted me?

866
00:57:13,838 --> 00:57:16,907
Because I trust you. I want to hear it from you.

867
00:57:17,637 --> 00:57:18,807
Please answer my question.

868
00:57:19,307 --> 00:57:20,747
You're crossing the line again.

869
00:57:25,387 --> 00:57:28,517
You perceive me and judge me as you please.

870
00:57:31,258 --> 00:57:32,727
That's crossing the line.

871
00:57:33,588 --> 00:57:34,628
That's not cool.

872
00:57:36,258 --> 00:57:39,898
And I don't care if you trust me or not.

873
00:57:40,727 --> 00:57:43,267
You asked me if I was okay, gave me an umbrella,

874
00:57:43,767 --> 00:57:45,068
and prepared a meal for me.

875
00:57:45,938 --> 00:57:47,807
These actions led by your own feelings...

876
00:57:50,108 --> 00:57:52,446
Yes. It was fun for a moment, and I was grateful too.

877
00:57:52,447 --> 00:57:53,847
But don't ever do that again.

878
00:57:55,517 --> 00:57:57,947
I played along at that moment without much thought.

879
00:57:58,588 --> 00:58:01,358
I should have known better. Don't do that again.

880
00:58:01,718 --> 00:58:03,488
I didn't ask you to like me back.

881
00:58:07,057 --> 00:58:08,528
I like you.

882
00:58:09,657 --> 00:58:12,366
Because I like you, I'm worried about you.

883
00:58:12,367 --> 00:58:13,767
So I wanted to know if you were okay.

884
00:58:15,137 --> 00:58:18,267
I didn't want someone I like to walk in the rain. And...

885
00:58:22,238 --> 00:58:23,577
it was a tough day for you.

886
00:58:24,878 --> 00:58:27,477
Professor Oh Soo Jae is a murderer.

887
00:58:29,648 --> 00:58:31,516
It's your fault that my sister died!

888
00:58:31,517 --> 00:58:33,847
Some even say you pushed that woman.

889
00:58:34,247 --> 00:58:36,258
People are calling you a murderer.

890
00:58:49,338 --> 00:58:51,168
Jo Gab and Hyung Chil always say this to me.

891
00:58:53,168 --> 00:58:54,577
When you're tired and having a tough day,

892
00:58:55,938 --> 00:58:57,608
having delicious food is the best remedy.

893
00:58:59,008 --> 00:59:00,447
That helps you the most.

894
00:59:01,648 --> 00:59:03,778
So I wanted to prepare a nice meal for you.

895
00:59:06,648 --> 00:59:08,657
Take your time and enjoy.

896
00:59:14,497 --> 00:59:16,128
Because I trust you,

897
00:59:16,958 --> 00:59:18,528
even if you told the police about what we found,

898
00:59:19,267 --> 00:59:20,867
you must have had your reasons.

899
00:59:22,137 --> 00:59:23,798
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

900
00:59:25,367 --> 00:59:26,766
I don't care if you trust me or not.

901
00:59:26,767 --> 00:59:28,438
You don't have to give me an answer...

902
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:30,738
about my feelings for you.

903
00:59:31,608 --> 00:59:33,077
I know it's one-sided.

904
00:59:34,747 --> 00:59:36,278
If this is also crossing the line,

905
00:59:37,177 --> 00:59:38,418
I'll just cross it.

906
00:59:39,488 --> 00:59:41,088
There's nothing I can do even if you think it's not cool.

907
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:43,958
That's just how I feel.

908
01:00:30,068 --> 01:00:31,097
Don't move.

909
01:00:32,307 --> 01:00:34,637
Don't move. You could get hurt.

910
01:00:44,347 --> 01:00:45,617
Please wait.

911
01:01:12,177 --> 01:01:13,548
I like you, Professor.

912
01:01:23,057 --> 01:01:24,787
I'm almost done. I just need a few more minutes.

913
01:01:31,267 --> 01:01:32,298
Wait.

914
01:01:38,568 --> 01:01:39,608
Sorry.

915
01:01:42,637 --> 01:01:45,508
There still might be some shards here. So be careful.

916
01:01:48,818 --> 01:01:51,048
You shouldn't put your feet down like that yet.

917
01:01:52,488 --> 01:01:53,617
What are you doing?

918
01:02:10,267 --> 01:02:13,307
(Why Her?)

919
01:02:31,458 --> 01:02:33,487
We'll take on Park Ji Young's case...

920
01:02:33,488 --> 01:02:34,656
for the Legal Clinic's first case.

921
01:02:34,657 --> 01:02:36,397
There's something fishy going on.

922
01:02:36,398 --> 01:02:39,096
Park So Young was pregnant when she passed away.

923
01:02:39,097 --> 01:02:42,196
The man Park So Young was seeing could have been the culprit.

924
01:02:42,197 --> 01:02:44,167
This must cause you some trouble.

925
01:02:44,168 --> 01:02:46,708
This might break your heart.

926
01:02:47,338 --> 01:02:48,607
You should kill me instead.

927
01:02:48,608 --> 01:02:50,337
Should I pretend I didn't see that?

928
01:02:50,338 --> 01:02:52,076
I hope you can keep the line clear.

929
01:02:52,077 --> 01:02:54,406
You must do everything I tell you to do.

930
01:02:54,407 --> 01:02:56,318
- That's your job. - I won't do it.

931
01:02:56,347 --> 01:02:59,487
Under any circumstances, I don't want to destroy my opponent.

932
01:02:59,488 --> 01:03:03,117
I want to take over while keeping it pristine.
