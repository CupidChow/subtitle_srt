I can't compare my experience to yours.

5
00:00:27,936 --> 00:00:29,535
But it's a case I want to forget too.

A case you want to forget?

7
00:00:35,215 --> 00:00:39,715
Defendant Kim Dong Gu is sentenced to ten years in prison.

8
00:00:43,355 --> 00:00:44,626
I...

9
00:00:46,486 --> 00:00:47,895
gave up on you.

(Episode 12)

I was relieved.

16

My goodness. Who knew?

17
00:01:27,395 --> 00:01:29,134
I thought Kim Dong Gu was the culprit.

18
00:01:29,135 --> 00:01:31,566
I shot myself in the foot right before I left the prosecution.

19
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:35,106
It's all in the past. Just let it go.

20
00:01:35,706 --> 00:01:39,346
You too, Ms. Oh. Don't worry. It's not worth your energy.

21
00:01:41,846 --> 00:01:45,285
The case is closed, so it doesn't matter whether I won or not.

22
00:01:45,615 --> 00:01:46,945
The present is what matters.

23
00:01:48,555 --> 00:01:49,755

Hey.

27
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:32,865
Ms. Oh, about No Byung Chul.

28
00:02:32,926 --> 00:02:35,865
I heard they were suddenly sending him to solitary confinement today.

29
00:02:36,465 --> 00:02:38,964
You have to be on your best behaviour before being released on parole.

30
00:02:38,965 --> 00:02:41,076
But apparently, he got into a fight out of the blue.

31
00:02:42,206 --> 00:02:44,334
- No, I swear! - Come out!

32
00:02:44,335 --> 00:02:46,404
This is nuts.

33
00:02:46,405 --> 00:02:48,214
Why would I fight now?

34
00:02:48,215 --> 00:02:49,775
- Come on! - I swear, I didn't fight.

35
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,945
Wait, hold on.

36
00:02:51,946 --> 00:02:54,046
Hang on. Bring Seo Jun Myeong to me.

37
00:02:54,115 --> 00:02:55,614

(9 years ago)

39
00:02:58,226 --> 00:03:01,095
Just because no one is watching or listening,

40
00:03:02,555 --> 00:03:04,256
do you think you can keep me here for ten days?

41
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,495
You see, you should not underestimate me.

42
00:03:07,696 --> 00:03:08,935
I know that.

43
00:03:10,236 --> 00:03:13,506
That's why the US Court wants us to extradite you immediately.

44
00:03:14,775 --> 00:03:16,736
They have already sent an official request.

45
00:03:17,036 --> 00:03:18,275
Just extradite me.

46
00:03:19,275 --> 00:03:21,516
Do it, I don't care!

47
00:03:21,645 --> 00:03:23,315
Do you know what will happen if you go there?

48
00:03:24,946 --> 00:03:28,155
Recently, we caught another scumbag like you.

49
00:03:28,756 --> 00:03:30,486
He created a server in the US just like you did...

50
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:33,154
and uploaded tens of thousands of sexual exploitation videos.

51
00:03:33,155 --> 00:03:35,155
I believe he's 19.

52
00:03:35,756 --> 00:03:37,226
He was sentenced to life.

53
00:03:39,196 --> 00:03:41,835
But as soon as that kid was sent to jail,

54
00:03:41,965 --> 00:03:43,935
he got beaten up to a pulp by some big guys there...

55
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,536
and fell into a coma.

56
00:03:52,206 --> 00:03:53,405
What do you say?

57
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,576
Are you now ready for a chat with me?

58
00:03:58,815 --> 00:03:59,886
Yes?

59
00:04:03,115 --> 00:04:06,054
We have caught the real culprit in the Jeon Na Jung case,

60
00:04:06,055 --> 00:04:08,525
which set the whole nation in uproar in September of last year.

61
00:04:09,256 --> 00:04:11,225
The culprit is No Byung Chul, who has seven prior convictions...

62
00:04:11,226 --> 00:04:13,666
resulting from offences such as rape, robbery, and drug trafficking.

63
00:04:13,726 --> 00:04:16,334
We were investigating him for a different case,

64
00:04:16,335 --> 00:04:17,834
where he uploaded sexual exploitation videos...

65
00:04:17,835 --> 00:04:18,905
on a US-based server he created.

66
00:04:19,435 --> 00:04:22,434
During our investigation, we discovered evidence that tied him...

67
00:04:22,435 --> 00:04:25,375
to the Jeon Na Jung case, and he confessed to the crime.

68
00:04:25,906 --> 00:04:29,075
Then what will happen to Kim Dong Gu who is behind bars at the moment?

69
00:04:29,315 --> 00:04:30,944
Now that we have the real culprit,

70
00:04:30,945 --> 00:04:33,444
we will drop all charges against Kim Dong Gu...

71
00:04:33,445 --> 00:04:35,684
to make sure that he can be released as quickly as possible.

72
00:04:35,685 --> 00:04:38,485
But at the time, all the evidence and witnesses...

73
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,625
proved that he was the culprit.

74
00:04:39,786 --> 00:04:43,156
The evidence found at the scene was placed there by No Byung Chul.

75
00:04:43,296 --> 00:04:46,465
All the other evidence was not directly related to the case,

76
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:49,796
and the witnesses were mistaken.

77

79
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,805
Well, now that No Byung Chul has been caught...

80
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:01,776

00:05:29,005 --> 00:05:30,005

You said Kim Dong Gu was the culprit.

88
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:40,916
Now, you're saying No Byung Chul did it?

89
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:44,185
Will you bring in someone else for the case?

90
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:48,255
How many times must I tell you? No Byung Chul did it.

91
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:50,396
What is it that you want?

92
00:05:50,596 --> 00:05:53,026
If you want me to manage No Byung Chul,

93
00:05:53,195 --> 00:05:56,466
you'll have to pay me twice as much as the amount I was promised.

The person who framed me...

102
00:06:15,786 --> 00:06:17,716
and used you to cover it up.

103
00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:21,396

What are you working on?

111
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,916
I was doing some research.

112

Do you have to intern under Soo Jae? It must be hard.

Do you want to grab a drink with me?

115
00:07:05,005 --> 00:07:06,166
I had no idea...

116
00:07:06,365 --> 00:07:09,135
you knew so much about the case...

117
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,375

I sure know a lot.

119

I may not know about other things, but I know a lot about that case.

120

But that case...

121
00:07:22,955 --> 00:07:25,885
Soo Jae represented the accused as a public defender and lost.

122

How did she manage to join the firm after losing the case?

123

He went to school with Father and taught Soo Jae as well.

127
00:07:53,315 --> 00:07:57,255
He used that man to give her a sign.

128
00:07:58,185 --> 00:07:59,226
A sign?

129
00:08:00,656 --> 00:08:01,726
What do you mean?

130
00:08:01,995 --> 00:08:03,926
Think, you fool.

131
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:06,395
Father was the chief prosecutor,

132
00:08:06,396 --> 00:08:08,166
and the Kim Dong Gu case suddenly took place.

133
00:08:08,935 --> 00:08:12,336
He had to put Kim Dong Gu behind bars in the name of justice,

134
00:08:12,505 --> 00:08:14,835
but Oh Soo Jae, a mere public defender,

135
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:16,075
kept getting on his nerves.

136
00:08:17,676 --> 00:08:19,375
What do you think Father did?

137
00:08:20,046 --> 00:08:22,115
Guess. You know how Father is.

138
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:27,885
Are you saying she mishandled the trial?

139
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:33,055
No, she did not "mishandle" it.

140
00:08:33,325 --> 00:08:35,555
She deliberately lost.

141
00:08:36,256 --> 00:08:39,465
She stabbed Kim Dong Gu in the back.

142
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,366
You see, this world...

143

These are what moves the world.

145

146
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,215
That's how the world works.

147
00:09:03,786 --> 00:09:05,085
That much I know.

148
00:09:27,345 --> 00:09:29,975
The breeze feels very nice. Slow down a little.

149
00:09:30,075 --> 00:09:31,176
Sure, sir.

150
00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:38,725
Let me be very clear.

151
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:43,055
Unfortunately, I have no respect for you son.

152
00:09:43,996 --> 00:09:48,266
And just like you, I had never done something for someone else's gain.

153
00:09:49,536 --> 00:09:51,166
I only do things for myself.

154
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:56,305
So I will never be someone else's person.

155
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,676
She has no idea what's awaiting her,

156
00:10:01,776 --> 00:10:04,416
and she doesn't know that she is in the palm of my hand.

157
00:10:16,926 --> 00:10:18,564
You have conflicts of interest.

158
00:10:18,565 --> 00:10:21,225
So you'll stop here. But not me.

159
00:10:21,565 --> 00:10:23,036
I'll risk everything I have to protect her.

160
00:10:23,465 --> 00:10:27,105
So you have a nice life as Chairman Choi Tae Guk's son.

161
00:10:28,065 --> 00:10:29,575
No, Kim Dong Gu.

162
00:10:31,176 --> 00:10:32,376
You won't be able to either.

163

00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:52,695
What about you, sir? What brings you here?

166
00:10:54,026 --> 00:10:57,266
I have a daughter.

167
00:10:57,965 --> 00:11:00,565
My daughter got into a big accident ten years ago.

168
00:11:02,406 --> 00:11:04,435
I wonder what kind of accident it was.

169
00:11:10,575 --> 00:11:12,845
But this girl, Jeon Na Jung...

170
00:11:13,246 --> 00:11:16,416
I found out later on that she helped my daughter that day,

171
00:11:16,516 --> 00:11:19,756
but I found out only after she'd died such a tragic death.

172
00:11:23,855 --> 00:11:24,996
Na Jung.

173
00:11:25,725 --> 00:11:27,666
Regardless of what happened,

174
00:11:28,695 --> 00:11:32,435
I could neither help nor save you.

175
00:11:46,985 --> 00:11:48,985
About Jeon Na Jung...

176
00:11:49,116 --> 00:11:50,786
You've been watching me, haven't you?

177
00:11:52,685 --> 00:11:54,225
Since when?

178
00:11:56,955 --> 00:12:01,765
Hey. Today, we had the highest sales since our grand opening.

179
00:12:01,766 --> 00:12:03,464
I'm so stoked.

180
00:12:03,465 --> 00:12:06,964
Let's put up a banner and throw a party.

181
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:08,006
Okay.

182
00:12:11,406 --> 00:12:13,006
(Seojung University 2018 School of Law)

183
00:12:23,315 --> 00:12:25,225
The admission brochure in our mailbox.

184
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:28,595
I received it again the following year.

185
00:12:31,225 --> 00:12:32,996
So you were the one...

186
00:12:35,766 --> 00:12:37,835
When I saw you at the admissions interview,

187
00:12:38,605 --> 00:12:41,266
I was proud of you. It made me happy.

188
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,276
But why were you watching me?

189
00:12:45,746 --> 00:12:48,205
Do you believe that No Byung Chul is the real culprit?

190
00:12:49,746 --> 00:12:51,516
Why would you ask me that?

191
00:12:53,286 --> 00:12:55,156
Do you think that he's not the real culprit?

192
00:12:56,585 --> 00:12:57,855
On what grounds?

193
00:12:58,725 --> 00:13:00,386
I didn't sleep well last night.

194
00:13:00,985 --> 00:13:02,996
I should go home and get some sleep.

195
00:13:11,095 --> 00:13:13,435
We pulled an all-nighter because of Chan.

196
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,136
What are we doing here?

197
00:13:19,345 --> 00:13:20,805
Don't I stink?

198
00:13:23,215 --> 00:13:26,146
My gosh. Did you really stay up all night?

199
00:13:27,085 --> 00:13:28,955
What is going on?

200
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:33,026
What's happening that you pulled an all-nighter and called me here?

201
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:34,825
Kim Dong Gu.

202
00:13:37,156 --> 00:13:38,865
("Stepbrother Kim Dong Gu Gets Acquitted of Murder Case")

203
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:40,366
Gong Chan is Kim Dong Gu.

204
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:43,866
Ms. Ji Soon Ok is Kim Dong Gu's stepmother.

205
00:13:44,095 --> 00:13:46,506
And Kim Dong Gu is Jeon Na Jung's stepbrother.

206
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,704
Ten years ago, he was falsely accused of murdering her,

207
00:13:48,705 --> 00:13:50,275
so he was wrongfully incarcerated for a year.

208
00:13:50,276 --> 00:13:53,546
And Professor Oh was the public defender who represented him.

209
00:13:56,075 --> 00:13:58,545
So you guys all found out.

210
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,746
You already knew about everything?

211
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,484
I only found out yesterday...

212
00:14:03,485 --> 00:14:06,055
when I went to the police station with Yoon Sang for something else.

213
00:14:06,156 --> 00:14:09,496
The skeleton in Yeongpyeong District is my sister, Jeon Na Jung!

214
00:14:10,426 --> 00:14:12,626
- Hey! - Investigate now!

215
00:14:13,426 --> 00:14:14,426
What?

216
00:14:15,136 --> 00:14:17,866
Chan said the skeleton was his sister?

217
00:14:18,705 --> 00:14:20,235
What is going on?

218
00:14:20,305 --> 00:14:22,036
Maybe Professor Oh...

219
00:14:22,335 --> 00:14:24,605
knew everything from the get-go.

220
00:14:25,146 --> 00:14:26,676
That Chan is Kim Dong Gu.

221
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:30,545
No, she didn't know. She only found out recently.

222
00:14:30,546 --> 00:14:31,714
Right.

223
00:14:31,715 --> 00:14:34,985
Even I didn't recognize him. I had no idea Chan was Kim Dong Gu.

224
00:14:35,386 --> 00:14:37,055
You met Kim Dong Gu in the past?

225
00:14:37,156 --> 00:14:38,756
Yes, when I was a rookie cop.

226
00:14:38,825 --> 00:14:41,026
Our precinct was in charge of the case.

227
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,224
The Ungju stepsister murder.

228
00:14:44,225 --> 00:14:45,526
It wasn't me.

229
00:14:46,496 --> 00:14:49,295
- Shut it, you punk. - Why are you hitting me?

230
00:14:49,296 --> 00:14:51,635
If you don't behave yourself, you're dead meat. Do you understand?

231
00:14:51,636 --> 00:14:53,665
- I said, it wasn't me. - Goodness.

232
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:54,934
Come on, you punk!

233
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,135
- I told you that it wasn't me. - Hey! Be gentle, will you?

234
00:14:57,136 --> 00:14:58,844
- Seriously. - You little rat. Come here!

235
00:14:58,845 --> 00:15:00,906
I told you. It really wasn't me. Let go!

236
00:15:01,975 --> 00:15:03,215
Who are you? Are you new here?

237
00:15:05,945 --> 00:15:07,215
You must've heard about Kim Dong Gu.

238
00:15:07,546 --> 00:15:10,685
The scumbag who raped and murdered his own stepsister.

239
00:15:11,315 --> 00:15:13,355
He deserves the death penalty.

240
00:15:13,725 --> 00:15:15,455
A scumbag like him does not deserve human rights.

241
00:15:16,656 --> 00:15:18,156
I saw him.

242
00:15:19,026 --> 00:15:20,666
But I only saw him from afar.

243
00:15:21,496 --> 00:15:23,235
He seemed angry and hurt by the false accusations.

244
00:15:28,335 --> 00:15:31,536
(Jeongseok Movers)

245
00:15:34,006 --> 00:15:36,575
- All right, 1, 2. - There.

246
00:15:37,945 --> 00:15:40,386
Put it down. Good. Move it.

247
00:15:41,085 --> 00:15:42,185
All right.

248
00:15:43,455 --> 00:15:45,084
In 1, 2, 3.

249
00:15:45,085 --> 00:15:46,126
(Gong Chan)

250

(Gong Chan)

251
00:15:58,835 --> 00:16:01,305
Professor Oh, I'll find it.

252
00:16:02,105 --> 00:16:05,075
I'll find evidence that No Byung Chul isn't the culprit.

253
00:16:06,376 --> 00:16:08,205
There's someone who is speculating the same thing.

254
00:16:08,575 --> 00:16:11,646
I heard Na Jung helped his daughter that night.

255
00:16:12,646 --> 00:16:14,046
I'm sure I can find something.

256
00:16:22,955 --> 00:16:24,325
I'm not interested.

257
00:16:27,896 --> 00:16:29,136
Kim Dong Gu.

258
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,435
I told you not to get close.

259
00:16:39,046 --> 00:16:40,376
Don't forget what I said.

260
00:17:01,325 --> 00:17:03,435
Hey, Soo Jae. Move.

261
00:17:04,136 --> 00:17:05,565
Gosh, this is so heavy.

262
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:10,076
Hey! Even the entrance is massive.

263
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:12,045
Look at you. Oh, boy.

264
00:17:12,146 --> 00:17:15,915
My gosh! Your place is so nice!

265
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,214
You should've thrown a housewarming party right away.

266
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:22,955
And I need to consult you on so many things.

267
00:17:23,015 --> 00:17:25,116
I need to get a divorce. My life is a mess now.

268
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:26,524
Divorce? All of a sudden?

269
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:28,484
What? Read the room.

270
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:31,625
It's not sudden. You have no idea. Soo Jae knows.

271
00:17:31,626 --> 00:17:34,596
Soo Jae, I want a divorce. It's nuts. I'm getting a divorce.

272
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:35,866
Would you hear me out?

273
00:17:36,035 --> 00:17:38,535
All right. Will you calm down first?

274
00:17:39,106 --> 00:17:40,435
Okay.

275
00:17:40,705 --> 00:17:43,005
By the way, it doesn't look like she's had dinner yet.

276
00:17:44,535 --> 00:17:47,146
Right? She looks even skinnier now.

277
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:48,676
She'll disappear at this rate.

278
00:17:49,616 --> 00:17:51,444
Soo Jae, we bought tons of delicious things.

279
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,715
- Let's eat this. - Let's eat.

280
00:18:05,396 --> 00:18:06,626
Soo Jae.

281
00:18:07,695 --> 00:18:09,396
What? What is it?

282
00:18:09,896 --> 00:18:11,636
Tell Chan.

283
00:18:14,265 --> 00:18:16,774
You didn't betray Kim Dong Gu.

284
00:18:16,775 --> 00:18:18,576
You had no choice back then.

285
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:21,775
Tell him why you did what you did back then.

286
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,576
If he hears it, he'll understand.

287
00:18:26,545 --> 00:18:28,715
I can't expect him to understand it.

288
00:18:30,086 --> 00:18:32,685
It'd be wrong of me to ask for his understanding.

289
00:18:40,725 --> 00:18:44,935
Gosh, I can't believe she has to tidy up now.

290
00:18:45,195 --> 00:18:47,666
Just leave it. I'll tidy up later.

291
00:18:48,235 --> 00:18:51,136
My gosh. You've been working? What is this?

292
00:18:54,376 --> 00:18:55,714
Kim Dong Gu.

293
00:18:55,715 --> 00:18:56,945
(Kim Dong Gu, 18 years old at the time)

294
00:18:57,715 --> 00:18:58,846
Jeon Na Jung.

295
00:18:59,086 --> 00:19:02,085
"I got hit in the head at the construction site."

296
00:19:02,086 --> 00:19:04,156
"When I woke up, I was at the seaside."

297
00:19:07,626 --> 00:19:10,656
Hey, Chan is innocent indeed.

298
00:19:11,926 --> 00:19:14,066
Yes. He is innocent.

299
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:19,034
Choi Tae Guk was the chief prosecutor,

300
00:19:19,035 --> 00:19:20,636
and Seo Jun Myeong was the prosecutor in charge?

301
00:19:21,265 --> 00:19:22,876
What a small world.

302
00:19:27,076 --> 00:19:28,306
Ms. Oh, this...

303
00:19:31,275 --> 00:19:33,545
"I went to pick her up"...

304
00:19:35,045 --> 00:19:37,515
Did Chan write this?

305
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:44,025
If No Byung Chul isn't the real culprit,

306
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:47,295
it means someone deliberately framed Kim Dong Gu...

307
00:19:47,695 --> 00:19:50,234
and No Byung Chul as well.

308
00:19:50,235 --> 00:19:52,565
And No Byung Chul, who was awaiting parole,

309
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,806
suddenly got into a fight and was sent to solitary confinement.

310
00:19:57,005 --> 00:19:59,306
It's highly likely that it was orchestrated by the same person.

311
00:20:00,176 --> 00:20:01,745
But why?

312
00:20:02,005 --> 00:20:03,975
Because the skeleton turned up.

313
00:20:04,945 --> 00:20:07,215
When the skeleton was found, the person behind all of this...

314
00:20:07,245 --> 00:20:10,656
The culprit realized it for sure...

315
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,886
that what he did had been exposed.

316
00:20:14,725 --> 00:20:17,326
Jeon Na Jung...

317
00:20:18,025 --> 00:20:19,666
The name rings a bell.

318
00:20:20,725 --> 00:20:23,135
This was such a famous case.

319
00:20:23,136 --> 00:20:25,034
I bet even kindergarten kids knew her name as well.

320
00:20:25,035 --> 00:20:27,035
No. This was ten years ago.

321
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:30,335
I was a resident back then. I was so busy that I barely slept.

322
00:20:30,336 --> 00:20:32,474
I didn't even know that Soo Jae worked on this case.

323
00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:34,576
- Really? - Yes.

324
00:20:36,745 --> 00:20:38,886
I swear, I've heard this name before.

325
00:20:45,015 --> 00:20:46,126
Mr. Ha.

326
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:48,795
- Yes. - About Choi Yoon Sang...

327
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:51,655
A few days ago, he suddenly asked me...

328
00:20:51,656 --> 00:20:54,426
for the files on the Kim Dong Gu case.

329
00:20:57,795 --> 00:20:59,435
The files on the Kim Dong Gu case?

330
00:21:00,406 --> 00:21:02,275
Why do you suddenly want to see the files?

331
00:21:02,535 --> 00:21:04,435
I was intrigued that my mentor,

332
00:21:04,935 --> 00:21:06,906
Ms. Oh, was crushed in court.

333
00:21:07,745 --> 00:21:08,915
If I give you that,

334
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,545
what will the youngest son of the chairman give me?

335
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,444
Even if you can't give me anything now,

336
00:21:13,445 --> 00:21:15,086
there has to be something to look forward to...

337
00:21:16,616 --> 00:21:18,356
for me to give you the files, right?

338
00:21:20,525 --> 00:21:21,525
I see.

339
00:21:23,896 --> 00:21:25,765
Will my answer...

340
00:21:27,025 --> 00:21:30,066
that I am better than my brother be enough for you?

341
00:21:32,265 --> 00:21:35,636
And please forget the bad history between us at school.

342
00:21:40,705 --> 00:21:41,775
Go on.

343
00:21:42,846 --> 00:21:44,044
Did you give him the files?

344
00:21:44,045 --> 00:21:46,285
Why wouldn't I? I won that case.

345
00:21:47,116 --> 00:21:49,886
And I did exactly what the chairman told me to do for that case.

346
00:21:52,116 --> 00:21:54,356
I'm asking you to look into that.

347
00:21:54,826 --> 00:21:55,826
Who knows?

348
00:21:56,556 --> 00:21:57,954
There might be a reason...

349
00:21:57,955 --> 00:21:59,195
why the chairman should be aware of this too.

350
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:04,465
(No results)

351
00:22:04,965 --> 00:22:06,235
Nothing popped up.

352
00:22:06,705 --> 00:22:08,166
This case took place ten years ago.

353
00:22:08,406 --> 00:22:12,005
Shouldn't the victim's DNA still be in your database?

354
00:22:12,136 --> 00:22:14,445
Right. It should be.

355
00:22:14,975 --> 00:22:16,444
Then what can we do?

356
00:22:16,445 --> 00:22:19,015
Let me collect your DNA first.

357
00:22:19,116 --> 00:22:21,044
And we'll compare that to the DNA of the skeleton.

358
00:22:21,045 --> 00:22:22,386
It will take about a week.

359
00:22:23,255 --> 00:22:25,386
The results will come out in a few days if we expedite it.

360
00:22:25,485 --> 00:22:26,685
Don't worry.

361
00:22:34,525 --> 00:22:37,435
All right. Now that we have overcome a big obstacle,

362
00:22:38,465 --> 00:22:40,235
a drink in the afternoon should be allowed to celebrate.

363
00:22:40,965 --> 00:22:44,735
Thank you for conducting due diligence quickly.

364
00:22:46,505 --> 00:22:48,705
Let's keep taking it easy, moving forward.

365
00:22:50,475 --> 00:22:52,015
All right.

366
00:22:55,755 --> 00:22:58,755
Thank you for your hard work, Ms. Oh.

367
00:22:59,056 --> 00:23:01,025
And I will continue to count on you.

368
00:23:05,455 --> 00:23:08,126
I'll look forward to your help to the end.

369
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:09,636
Sure.

370
00:23:10,866 --> 00:23:13,905
I wonder how it would've been without you.

371
00:23:13,906 --> 00:23:17,935
Gosh. You're too kind. You deserve all the credit, sir.

372
00:23:24,275 --> 00:23:28,146
All right. Cheers to the newly formed relationship...

373
00:23:28,586 --> 00:23:32,015
between Yoon Se Pil of SP Partners and Hansu Group.

374
00:23:32,086 --> 00:23:33,285
- Cheers. - Cheers.

375
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,525
I have a delivery for you.

376
00:23:46,606 --> 00:23:48,636
I see. Is that it?

377
00:23:48,836 --> 00:23:51,775
Yes. I wanted to send it to your office.

378
00:23:51,876 --> 00:23:54,146
But great artwork like this ought to be admired together.

379
00:23:54,646 --> 00:23:57,146
I can easily put it in my office afterwards.

380
00:24:00,116 --> 00:24:01,545
Shall we open it up?

381
00:24:05,015 --> 00:24:06,055
Gosh.

382
00:24:06,056 --> 00:24:07,586
(Song Mi Rim)

383
00:24:10,455 --> 00:24:11,495
Oh, my.

384
00:24:14,465 --> 00:24:15,494
Go ahead.

385
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,566
Jeon Na Jung's DNA wasn't in the police database.

386
00:24:18,695 --> 00:24:21,034
So they collected Ms. Ji Soon Ok's DNA.

387
00:24:21,035 --> 00:24:23,575
And No Byung Chul still might be in a solitary cell.

388
00:24:23,576 --> 00:24:24,606
I can't visit him.

389
00:24:25,676 --> 00:24:26,876
Keep checking.

390
00:24:27,745 --> 00:24:29,875
Goodness. This looks amazing.

391
00:24:29,876 --> 00:24:32,416
This is a painting, right?

392
00:24:32,515 --> 00:24:34,715
- Or is it a photograph? - Yes, it is.

393
00:24:35,086 --> 00:24:38,215
Gosh. I was wondering that in my head.

394
00:24:38,285 --> 00:24:40,184
I shouldn't brag in front of you,

395
00:24:40,185 --> 00:24:41,954
but I was in a photography club at my high school.

396
00:24:41,955 --> 00:24:43,095
Is that so?

397
00:24:43,096 --> 00:24:45,225
So I know a thing or two about photography.

398
00:24:45,426 --> 00:24:47,326
Was it the 2 to 3 ratio?

399
00:24:51,695 --> 00:24:55,465
Director Baek almost became my father-in-law.

400
00:24:55,906 --> 00:24:58,136
It was a photograph. No wonder.

401
00:24:58,306 --> 00:25:00,205
Gosh. Who's the photographer?

402
00:25:00,475 --> 00:25:02,676
Gosh. This is cool.

403
00:25:03,116 --> 00:25:05,916
Look at this. This is nice.

404
00:25:06,045 --> 00:25:08,416
This will look great in your office.

405
00:25:09,785 --> 00:25:11,416
It's so picturesque.

406
00:25:13,255 --> 00:25:15,356
- Gosh. - Goodness.

407
00:25:21,326 --> 00:25:22,735
You said you wanted to talk.

408
00:25:23,666 --> 00:25:25,396
You haven't said a thing for the past 15 minutes.

409
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,576
Kang Eun Seo.

410
00:25:31,606 --> 00:25:33,945
Director Baek's daughter, Kang Eun Seo.

411
00:25:35,816 --> 00:25:39,346
You talked about her when you didn't have to.

412
00:25:43,056 --> 00:25:46,725
Where is Kang Eun Seo? And what is she doing now?

413
00:25:49,955 --> 00:25:52,294
Her health isn't good. So she's at a nursing home.

414
00:25:52,295 --> 00:25:54,025
So you didn't get married?

415
00:25:54,525 --> 00:25:56,765
Because the woman you loved wasn't healthy?

416
00:25:58,195 --> 00:26:00,235
She was in an accident ten years ago.

417
00:26:03,306 --> 00:26:05,035
And the accident stopped her memories.

418
00:26:09,975 --> 00:26:11,215
Excuse me.

419
00:26:14,646 --> 00:26:16,014
I'm in a meeting.

420
00:26:16,015 --> 00:26:18,116
I just remembered about Jeon Na Jung.

421
00:26:18,185 --> 00:26:21,126
I found my journal I kept when I was a resident.

422
00:26:21,285 --> 00:26:22,724
Jeon Na Jung was transferred...

423
00:26:22,725 --> 00:26:24,525
to the hospital after a car accident on the night of September 4, 2012.

424
00:26:26,596 --> 00:26:27,695
Go on.

425
00:26:27,866 --> 00:26:30,366
But it wasn't Jeon Na Jung. It was someone else.

426
00:26:31,695 --> 00:26:33,034
Hold on.

427
00:26:33,035 --> 00:26:34,434
She's a victim of a hit-and-run accident.

428
00:26:34,435 --> 00:26:35,974
We confirmed a fracture in her right leg.

429
00:26:35,975 --> 00:26:37,635
- Her BP and pulse are... - It was Kang Eun Seo, not her.

430
00:26:37,636 --> 00:26:39,775
Kang Eun Seo was wearing Jeon Na Jung's clothes.

431
00:26:40,505 --> 00:26:43,816
We rushed her into surgery because she was in critical condition.

432
00:26:44,245 --> 00:26:46,445
We found signs of sexual assault on her body.

433
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:49,215
Okay.

434
00:26:52,685 --> 00:26:55,025
I heard Na Jung helped his daughter that night.

435
00:26:55,525 --> 00:26:57,025
I'm sure I can find something.

436
00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:08,606
Ms. Kang Eun Seo.

437
00:27:12,136 --> 00:27:14,505
She wasn't in an accident, but an incident.

438
00:27:16,816 --> 00:27:18,275
So...

439
00:27:20,146 --> 00:27:22,086
is she still suffering?

440
00:27:22,715 --> 00:27:24,916
Hearing your blunt question...

441
00:27:28,525 --> 00:27:29,826
is hard on me.

442
00:27:35,495 --> 00:27:36,896
We should end our talk here.

443
00:27:48,945 --> 00:27:52,945
Hitting the sauna is best when your body feels stiff.

444
00:27:54,146 --> 00:27:56,955
The hospital bed was a piece of garbage.

445
00:27:57,755 --> 00:27:58,856
Gosh.

446
00:27:59,056 --> 00:28:02,725
Assemblyman Lee, I saw on TV that your ratings had gone up again.

447
00:28:04,396 --> 00:28:05,925
You ought to buy us a meal.

448
00:28:05,926 --> 00:28:07,166
I'm not sure about that.

449
00:28:07,926 --> 00:28:10,336
Scoring high approval ratings isn't everything.

450
00:28:10,495 --> 00:28:14,136
Even my staff is worried about the two-year presidency.

451
00:28:15,035 --> 00:28:18,435
I did all this work just to have a two-year presidential term?

452
00:28:19,306 --> 00:28:21,606
If you don't like it, you can withdraw it.

453
00:28:23,376 --> 00:28:25,945
I racked my brains, so I could help you...

454
00:28:26,185 --> 00:28:27,916
become president.

455
00:28:28,616 --> 00:28:30,955
If you don't like it, there's nothing I can do.

456
00:28:31,156 --> 00:28:33,725
Gosh. Is that so?

457
00:28:34,356 --> 00:28:38,656
If I don't like it, I can just back out of it?

458
00:28:39,596 --> 00:28:40,765
Of course.

459
00:28:41,896 --> 00:28:44,435
But you won't be moving into the Blue House.

460
00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:50,475
Come on.

461
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:56,816
Okay.

462
00:28:58,146 --> 00:28:59,615
We have some news about Hansu Group.

463
00:28:59,616 --> 00:29:02,755
The construction in Yeongpyeong District has resumed.

464
00:29:02,816 --> 00:29:05,085
And the sell-off of Hansu Bio is moving forward...

465
00:29:05,086 --> 00:29:06,984
- smoothly. - Check the other channels.

466
00:29:06,985 --> 00:29:09,555
We're conducting due diligence smoothly.

467
00:29:09,556 --> 00:29:11,954
And the trust between Hansu Bio and us is quite strong.

468
00:29:11,955 --> 00:29:13,566
SP Partners...

469
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:16,565
plans to wrap up the process as fast as possible.

470
00:29:16,566 --> 00:29:17,695
Thank you.

471
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:21,035
Okay. All right.

472
00:29:25,505 --> 00:29:28,705
You should be the one treating us to a meal.

473
00:29:28,806 --> 00:29:30,044
Sounds good.

474
00:29:30,045 --> 00:29:33,086
Let's invite the fortune-teller. It's been a while.

475
00:29:33,445 --> 00:29:37,485
We should ask the fortune-teller...

476
00:29:37,586 --> 00:29:40,984
to put talismans on the bottoms of Our Majesty's feet,

477
00:29:40,985 --> 00:29:43,056
so he gets elected president. Okay?

478
00:29:43,255 --> 00:29:44,356
Your Majesty.

479
00:29:46,295 --> 00:29:47,295
What?

480
00:29:47,866 --> 00:29:50,764
The bottoms of his feet are soft like baby's feet.

481
00:29:50,765 --> 00:29:52,464
How can they be so smooth?

482
00:29:52,465 --> 00:29:55,464
My goodness. That's enough.

483
00:29:55,465 --> 00:29:56,836
Seriously. They are so soft.

484
00:30:14,955 --> 00:30:16,725
Inmate 7279.

485
00:30:19,626 --> 00:30:21,495
Inmate 7279.

486
00:30:22,596 --> 00:30:24,765
Come on. What is he doing? Why isn't he answering me?

487
00:30:32,745 --> 00:30:33,806
Over here!

488
00:30:35,146 --> 00:30:36,215
Over here!

489
00:30:44,356 --> 00:30:47,426
(Kang Eun Seo, Baek Jin Ki and Yoon Se Pil)

490
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:53,165
(Baek Jin Ki and Yoon Se Pil)

491
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:57,396
I want to buy Han Sung Bum's safe house in Samjung-dong.

492
00:30:57,735 --> 00:30:59,265
What's your take on it?

493
00:31:00,136 --> 00:31:02,806
He bought Han Sung Bum's safe house.

494
00:31:03,435 --> 00:31:06,275
And he gave away Director Baek's photo as a present.

495
00:31:08,745 --> 00:31:09,775
Why?

496
00:31:10,816 --> 00:31:12,116
For what?

497
00:31:19,426 --> 00:31:20,426
Yes.

498
00:31:20,656 --> 00:31:23,656
Ms. Oh. Turn on the news. No Byung Chul is dead.

499
00:31:24,755 --> 00:31:25,856
He committed suicide.

500
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:30,694
This just came in.

501
00:31:30,695 --> 00:31:34,504
The real culprit in the Ungju Stepsister Murder in 2012...

502
00:31:34,505 --> 00:31:35,934
took his own life.

503
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,375
At the time,

504
00:31:37,376 --> 00:31:39,204
the victim's stepbrother Kim was convicted of the murder,

505
00:31:39,205 --> 00:31:41,176
which sent shockwaves through the country.

506
00:31:41,245 --> 00:31:43,815
However, the truth came to light a year later...

507
00:31:43,816 --> 00:31:45,274
when No confessed to the crime.

508
00:31:45,275 --> 00:31:47,444
No confessed that he had abandoned the victim's corpse...

509
00:31:47,445 --> 00:31:50,284
after raping and murdering her...

510
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:53,086
at a construction site in Samjung-dong.

511
00:31:53,356 --> 00:31:54,555
Next news.

512
00:31:54,556 --> 00:31:57,954
No, who had been serving his sentence since being convicted...

513
00:31:57,955 --> 00:31:59,425
in the Ungju Stepsister Murder,

514
00:31:59,426 --> 00:32:02,225
died by suicide.

515
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:05,034
It is said that he frequently mentioned his guilt...

516
00:32:05,035 --> 00:32:08,135
toward the victim and her family.

517
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:09,405
He was emotionally distressed,

518
00:32:09,406 --> 00:32:10,635
waiting for his early release on parole.

519
00:32:10,636 --> 00:32:13,445
It is said that he often had problems with his cellmates.

520
00:32:13,676 --> 00:32:15,774
Witnesses have also said that they heard him shouting...

521
00:32:15,775 --> 00:32:18,945
and letting out tormented screams every night.

522
00:32:19,045 --> 00:32:21,984
He frequently fought with his cellmates,

523
00:32:21,985 --> 00:32:25,255
so he was recently sent to solitary confinement and died by suicide.

524
00:32:31,056 --> 00:32:32,295
Oh, there he is!

525
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:38,365
Tell us why you decided to accept the Justice Minister position.

526
00:32:38,366 --> 00:32:40,335
The current administration is nearing its end.

527
00:32:40,336 --> 00:32:41,336
Why did you accept the position?

528
00:32:41,935 --> 00:32:44,734
I wish to make sure that everyone is protected by the law...

529
00:32:44,735 --> 00:32:48,306
and that no one ever feels wronged by law enforcement.

530
00:32:48,576 --> 00:32:51,876
I'd like to contribute to building a society...

531
00:32:52,116 --> 00:32:55,385
where the law can always be applied properly. That is my wish.

532
00:32:55,386 --> 00:32:57,155
Will you step down from your position at the school?

533
00:32:57,156 --> 00:32:58,555
What are the people at the school saying?

534
00:32:58,556 --> 00:33:00,785
- What will be your role? - What's your take on...

535
00:33:02,185 --> 00:33:04,926
No Byung Chul did not die by suicide.

536
00:33:06,056 --> 00:33:07,866
He'd never take his own life.

537
00:33:08,765 --> 00:33:10,495
He's not the culprit, and he didn't kill himself.

538
00:33:14,336 --> 00:33:15,406
You know...

539
00:33:16,775 --> 00:33:18,275
who is behind all of this, don't you?

540
00:33:20,676 --> 00:33:22,505
The person who framed me...

541
00:33:23,176 --> 00:33:25,176
and even did this to No Byung Chul to cover it all up.

542
00:33:27,416 --> 00:33:28,846
Tell me who it is.

543
00:33:30,255 --> 00:33:33,386
At the moment, I can only speculate. There's no evidence.

544
00:33:34,056 --> 00:33:36,295
Had there been evidence, I would've caught the person long ago.

545
00:34:14,596 --> 00:34:15,726
These photos.

546
00:34:18,366 --> 00:34:19,605
I put them up so I won't forget.

547
00:34:20,806 --> 00:34:22,636
So I won't forget about that day even for a moment.

548
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:26,306
My daughter is still stuck in that moment ten years ago.

549
00:34:31,476 --> 00:34:33,186
So you knew it wasn't me.

550
00:34:35,645 --> 00:34:37,156
When did you find out?

551
00:34:39,926 --> 00:34:41,826
Before my trial,

552
00:34:43,395 --> 00:34:45,156
did you already know that I didn't do it?

553
00:34:47,295 --> 00:34:48,366
I'm sorry.

554
00:34:49,496 --> 00:34:50,665
I really am.

555
00:34:51,996 --> 00:34:53,906
If you knew it wasn't me, how could you...

556
00:34:58,605 --> 00:35:00,576
I knew, but there was nothing I could do.

557
00:35:00,945 --> 00:35:02,476
I had no power,

558
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:05,145
and I couldn't reveal the fact that it wasn't you.

559
00:35:06,246 --> 00:35:07,945
So I waited for the right moment.

560
00:35:08,145 --> 00:35:10,085
I believed that day would come.

561
00:35:10,715 --> 00:35:12,855
When you and Soo Jae came here,

562
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:16,156
I thought it was our chance to right the wrong.

563
00:35:16,326 --> 00:35:18,295
Then like a miracle, your sister...

564
00:35:19,395 --> 00:35:20,426
A miracle?

565
00:35:26,366 --> 00:35:28,605
Don't you dare call it a miracle.

566
00:35:30,136 --> 00:35:31,806
My sister, Na Jung,

567
00:35:32,775 --> 00:35:34,906
died a horrible death.

568
00:35:35,145 --> 00:35:38,145
And what, a miracle? Don't you dare call it like that!

569
00:35:40,846 --> 00:35:42,016
I'm sorry.

570
00:35:42,985 --> 00:35:44,985
I just wanted to right the wrong.

571
00:35:45,915 --> 00:35:49,155
Even No Byung Chul's death. It could be telling us something.

572
00:35:49,156 --> 00:35:50,255
No.

573
00:35:51,156 --> 00:35:54,926
You missed your chance to right the wrong ten years ago.

574
00:35:56,366 --> 00:35:58,665
I will never join hands with you.

575
00:36:12,576 --> 00:36:13,715
Please.

576
00:36:14,915 --> 00:36:16,456
Please, I beg you.

577
00:36:18,715 --> 00:36:20,456
Get up, Jin Ki.

578
00:36:20,956 --> 00:36:23,855
I'd never take you down.

579
00:36:24,656 --> 00:36:25,695
Come on.

580
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,766
Get up already.

581
00:36:29,596 --> 00:36:30,596
Jin Ki.

582
00:36:32,335 --> 00:36:34,234
I wish to make sure that everyone is protected by the law...

583
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:37,005
and that no one ever feels wronged by law enforcement.

584
00:36:37,136 --> 00:36:38,675
I'd like to contribute to building a society...

585
00:36:38,676 --> 00:36:40,206
where the law can always be applied properly.

586
00:36:40,945 --> 00:36:43,515
"A society where the law can always be applied properly"?

587
00:36:43,516 --> 00:36:47,245
That is my wish.

588
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,185
Will you step down from your position at the school?

589
00:36:49,186 --> 00:36:51,655
What are the people at the school saying?

590
00:36:51,656 --> 00:36:54,485
(Chairman Choi Tae Guk)

591
00:36:55,855 --> 00:36:57,326
No Byung Chul is dead, sir.

592
00:36:57,926 --> 00:37:00,426
He took his own life just before his parole hearing.

593
00:37:03,065 --> 00:37:04,266
Sir, by any chance...

594
00:37:05,536 --> 00:37:07,064
Did you...

595
00:37:07,065 --> 00:37:08,105
What?

596
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:13,746
Why do I get a sense that you're enjoying this?

597
00:37:15,005 --> 00:37:16,145
Come here.

598
00:37:18,476 --> 00:37:20,116
- Jun Myeong. - Yes, sir.

599
00:37:20,145 --> 00:37:23,755
You haven't changed one bit. Your tongue is your biggest problem.

600
00:37:25,215 --> 00:37:27,625
If someone takes you down, just blame it on your tongue.

601
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:33,056
My apologies, sir. I should not have said that.

602
00:37:33,165 --> 00:37:36,025
I heard you gave the Kim Dong Gu case files to Yoon Sang.

603
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:39,195
Yes, sir. He said he wanted to know more about Ms. Oh, his mentor.

604
00:37:41,206 --> 00:37:42,266
Is that so?

605
00:37:43,536 --> 00:37:44,935
Don't give him anything else.

606
00:37:44,936 --> 00:37:45,976
I won't, sir.

607
00:37:57,386 --> 00:38:00,056
I always have to get on his nerves to grab his attention.

608
00:38:00,456 --> 00:38:01,826
What? What do you mean...

609
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:04,255
Hold on a moment.

610
00:38:12,136 --> 00:38:13,165
Hello?

611
00:38:13,965 --> 00:38:16,605
Why couldn't you check that sooner?

612
00:38:17,536 --> 00:38:20,076
You see, I am the warden.

613
00:38:20,906 --> 00:38:22,245
No Byung Chul, that little...

614
00:38:22,246 --> 00:38:24,616
Because of that scumbag...

615
00:38:24,746 --> 00:38:27,286
Watch your mouth. Please!

616
00:38:34,156 --> 00:38:36,655
So? What is the name of the person who visited No Byung Chul...

617
00:38:36,656 --> 00:38:39,156
on September 4 every year?

618
00:38:39,866 --> 00:38:40,895
Gong Chan.

619
00:38:41,426 --> 00:38:44,835
His surname is Gong. His full name is Gong Chan.

620
00:39:05,255 --> 00:39:06,785
I told you guys to analyse and summarize...

621
00:39:06,786 --> 00:39:10,156
the Court's written decisions on the major cases.

622
00:39:10,326 --> 00:39:12,496
Some of you haven't submitted it yet.

623
00:39:13,025 --> 00:39:15,395
Professor Oh, it's a huge assignment.

624
00:39:15,525 --> 00:39:17,765
Could we get an extension until the end of the week?

625
00:39:17,766 --> 00:39:18,894
No, that won't happen.

626
00:39:18,895 --> 00:39:21,235
- Please. - Give us an extension.

627
00:39:23,605 --> 00:39:25,405
Fine. Submit it by the end of the week.

628
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:28,444
But it's already overdue,

629
00:39:28,445 --> 00:39:29,806
so B will be the highest mark.

630
00:39:30,145 --> 00:39:31,215
No one will get an A.

631
00:39:31,315 --> 00:39:33,485
- No... - Professor Oh, please!

632
00:39:38,056 --> 00:39:41,585
Why didn't you answer your phone? I wanted to give you a heads-up.

633
00:39:42,386 --> 00:39:43,695
How have you guys been?

634
00:39:47,766 --> 00:39:50,436
Choi Yoon Sang asked me to come here today.

635
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:54,266
Professor Oh.

636
00:39:54,866 --> 00:39:57,476
The Court's written decisions you gave us.

637
00:39:57,576 --> 00:39:59,335
While analysing and summarizing them,

638
00:39:59,476 --> 00:40:02,045
I learned they were from the trials that you won.

639
00:40:02,105 --> 00:40:03,615
Right, I won most of the time.

640
00:40:03,616 --> 00:40:05,076
It got me curious.

641
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:08,246
"Has she ever lost any trials?"

642
00:40:09,016 --> 00:40:10,485
And I found out that there was one case.

643
00:40:10,815 --> 00:40:13,755
The Ungju Stepsister Murder, which took place ten years ago.

644
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,525
It was also known as the Kim Dong Gu case.

645
00:40:18,596 --> 00:40:20,064
In September of 2012,

646
00:40:20,065 --> 00:40:22,395
a 17-year-old girl, Jeon Na Jung, was raped and murdered.

647
00:40:22,866 --> 00:40:25,436
And her stepbrother, Kim Dong Gu, was arrested without a warrant.

648
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,936
It was all over the news, so everyone must remember the case.

649
00:40:29,366 --> 00:40:31,874
The public defender who represented Kim Dong Gu...

650
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:34,076
and lost the trial...

651
00:40:34,406 --> 00:40:35,806
was you, Professor Oh.

652
00:40:40,286 --> 00:40:42,385
The prosecutor in charge of the case...

653
00:40:42,386 --> 00:40:44,516
won the trial and got him sentenced to ten years in prison.

654
00:40:45,456 --> 00:40:47,926
That prosecutor was Professor Seo Jun Myeong,

655
00:40:48,226 --> 00:40:49,826
who is now TK's partner lawyer.

656
00:40:53,096 --> 00:40:54,366
What are you doing?

657
00:40:55,465 --> 00:40:59,136
Just watch. Watch and learn what you didn't know.

658
00:41:02,936 --> 00:41:05,806
Fine. I'll give you five minutes.

659
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:09,145
Look up the case and learn about it.

660
00:41:09,275 --> 00:41:11,045
That way, you can come up with questions.

661
00:41:11,176 --> 00:41:15,145
I caught No Byung Chul too. The man who committed suicide.

662
00:41:15,915 --> 00:41:18,556
I caught the real culprit.

663
00:41:19,855 --> 00:41:21,326
All right. See you guys in five minutes.

664
00:41:29,165 --> 00:41:30,536
Let's talk.

665
00:41:30,735 --> 00:41:33,835
Chan, you guys can talk after the lecture.

666
00:41:36,806 --> 00:41:39,405
You did nothing wrong.

667
00:41:39,406 --> 00:41:41,076
You've lived your life well.

668
00:41:52,915 --> 00:41:54,326
I'm rooting for you.

669
00:41:54,686 --> 00:41:56,655
You were innocent ten years ago.

670
00:41:56,656 --> 00:41:58,854
And you're really cool now, Gong Chan.

671
00:41:58,855 --> 00:42:01,596
Hey, it's fine. Stop frowning.

672
00:42:01,866 --> 00:42:03,465
So what if you're Kim Dong Gu?

673
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,714
Then...

674
00:42:18,715 --> 00:42:21,985
what was your reason behind arguing for Kim Dong Gu's innocence?

675
00:42:22,315 --> 00:42:23,955
No Byung Chul was caught a year later.

676
00:42:23,956 --> 00:42:25,115
So looking at the results,

677
00:42:25,116 --> 00:42:27,226
you were right to argue for his innocence.

678
00:42:27,485 --> 00:42:30,354
But during the trial, all the circumstances and evidence...

679
00:42:30,355 --> 00:42:32,326
pointed to Kim Dong Gu as the culprit.

680
00:42:32,395 --> 00:42:34,064
All the circumstances and evidence...

681
00:42:34,065 --> 00:42:36,496
pointed to Kim Dong Gu as the culprit.

682
00:42:36,665 --> 00:42:38,935
But the statement he made while arguing for his innocence...

683
00:42:38,936 --> 00:42:40,165
was very detailed...

684
00:42:40,406 --> 00:42:42,065
and convincing.

685
00:42:42,266 --> 00:42:44,505
Those two contradicting sides clashed with one another.

686
00:42:45,036 --> 00:42:46,374
So I believed the defendant.

687
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:47,906
No.

688
00:42:48,445 --> 00:42:51,645
Kim Dong Gu confessed that he killed Jeon Na Jung.

689
00:42:51,715 --> 00:42:55,084
A statement from an inmate said he even talked about his crime.

690
00:42:55,085 --> 00:42:56,215
Die, you jerk.

691
00:42:56,886 --> 00:42:59,755
Fine! I killed her!

692
00:43:00,255 --> 00:43:02,255
I killed her and dumped her in the ocean. So what?

693
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:06,655
The police questioned Kim Dong Gu all night on purpose,

694
00:43:06,656 --> 00:43:08,165
so he wouldn't get any sleep.

695
00:43:09,366 --> 00:43:12,996
And they even assaulted him in places that weren't visible.

696
00:43:13,366 --> 00:43:15,104
And it was confirmed...

697
00:43:15,105 --> 00:43:17,406
that he had been bullied by the inmates.

698
00:43:17,906 --> 00:43:20,976
Kim Dong Gu had sleep deprivation, and his mental state was unstable.

699
00:43:21,145 --> 00:43:23,645
So he gave up and confessed.

700
00:43:23,715 --> 00:43:26,645
That's not true. It was only a one-sided argument.

701
00:43:26,915 --> 00:43:29,185
Because he kept changing his stories,

702
00:43:29,186 --> 00:43:31,056
he started to doubt his own memory.

703
00:43:31,556 --> 00:43:32,656
Professor Oh.

704
00:43:33,215 --> 00:43:35,425
Was there a follow-up investigation and any change in his treatment...

705
00:43:35,426 --> 00:43:36,625
regarding police brutality?

706
00:43:36,755 --> 00:43:38,096
The police denied.

707
00:43:38,755 --> 00:43:41,496
They said Kim Dong Gu agreed to be questioned at night...

708
00:43:41,665 --> 00:43:43,165
and there was no police brutality.

709
00:43:43,395 --> 00:43:45,335
The wounds on his body were self-inflicted.

710
00:43:45,536 --> 00:43:48,135
You were the prosecutor in charge of the case.

711
00:43:48,136 --> 00:43:49,206
How did he seem when you questioned him?

712
00:43:49,306 --> 00:43:51,205
When you work as a prosecutor as long as I had been,

713
00:43:51,206 --> 00:43:52,775
you get a hunch.

714
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,604
"This guy is the culprit."

715
00:43:54,605 --> 00:43:55,676
"This guy isn't it."

716
00:43:56,605 --> 00:43:57,976
Kim Dong Gu was the former.

717
00:43:58,076 --> 00:44:00,386
"This guy was born with a despicable nature."

718
00:44:01,116 --> 00:44:02,545
But he wasn't the culprit.

719
00:44:03,585 --> 00:44:06,016
He was acquitted a year later and released from prison.

720
00:44:06,415 --> 00:44:10,395
Doesn't that prove that your hunch was wrong?

721
00:44:10,426 --> 00:44:13,326
Yes. I was wrong. I admit that.

722
00:44:13,456 --> 00:44:15,866
I usually admit when I'm wrong.

723
00:44:16,596 --> 00:44:18,694
But I never admit to doing something I didn't do.

724
00:44:18,695 --> 00:44:21,206
Why? The truth is always revealed in the end.

725
00:44:21,965 --> 00:44:26,005
On that note, I'll restore my honour and come back here.

726
00:44:30,275 --> 00:44:33,915
Gosh. You never change, do you?

727
00:44:35,085 --> 00:44:37,085
Good for you, Mr. Seo.

728
00:44:37,255 --> 00:44:39,056
You're still as rude as ever, Na Se Ryeon.

729
00:44:41,226 --> 00:44:42,985
How did you catch No Byung Chul?

730
00:44:44,926 --> 00:44:46,694
When he was arrested for another crime,

731
00:44:46,695 --> 00:44:47,765
you happened to figure out...

732
00:44:47,766 --> 00:44:48,766
he was the culprit while questioning him.

733
00:44:49,465 --> 00:44:51,866
Tell us how you got him in detail. Just give us the facts.

734
00:44:51,996 --> 00:44:53,266
That's confidential.

735
00:44:53,605 --> 00:44:55,305
No Byung Chul has rights too.

736
00:44:55,306 --> 00:44:58,334
He confessed to everything. And that process...

737
00:44:58,335 --> 00:44:59,806
That's also confidential.

738
00:45:02,045 --> 00:45:03,874
All the spotlight is on me.

739
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:06,374
Why don't you ask her some questions?

740
00:45:06,375 --> 00:45:09,686
Aren't you being a bit rude to the losing counsel?

741
00:45:12,485 --> 00:45:14,625
Choi Yoon Sang. You're responsible for this discussion.

742
00:45:17,625 --> 00:45:19,156
You must have questions.

743
00:45:23,295 --> 00:45:24,866
When I read the trip record,

744
00:45:24,996 --> 00:45:28,505
it made me wonder if you were fully prepared for it.

745
00:45:29,036 --> 00:45:32,576
Even the witnesses you brought in gave unfavourable testimonies to Kim.

746
00:45:33,306 --> 00:45:35,206
Did you prepare for the trial thoroughly?

747
00:45:36,476 --> 00:45:38,275
It looked like you didn't even try.

748
00:45:38,576 --> 00:45:40,945
He knows why I lost.

749
00:45:41,246 --> 00:45:43,215
And he wants Gong Chan to know.

750
00:45:44,156 --> 00:45:46,556
I don't think that question is worth your breath.

751
00:45:47,686 --> 00:45:50,024
People lose trials even when they do their best.

752
00:45:50,025 --> 00:45:52,226
You never thought that she might not have done...

753
00:45:52,895 --> 00:45:54,395
her best?

754
00:46:04,605 --> 00:46:05,605
The knife.

755
00:46:08,576 --> 00:46:11,615
Jeon Na Jung's blood, Kim Dong Gu's DNA,

756
00:46:11,616 --> 00:46:12,915
and three fingerprints were found on the knife.

757
00:46:13,476 --> 00:46:14,846
One of them belonged to Kim Dong Gu.

758
00:46:15,186 --> 00:46:16,914
The second one belonged to the cop...

759
00:46:16,915 --> 00:46:17,955
that collected the knife at the scene.

760
00:46:17,956 --> 00:46:19,585
But there was the third fingerprint.

761
00:46:20,485 --> 00:46:21,955
An unidentified fingerprint.

762
00:46:21,956 --> 00:46:23,556
- An unidentified fingerprint? - Unidentified?

763
00:46:24,726 --> 00:46:26,855
Gosh. Look, Ms. Oh.

764
00:46:27,565 --> 00:46:28,624
Just like ten years ago,

765
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:30,996
you're reading too much into the unidentified fingerprint.

766
00:46:31,136 --> 00:46:34,105
In this case, it doesn't matter whose fingerprint that is.

767
00:46:35,235 --> 00:46:37,405
The knife had the suspect's fingerprint.

768
00:46:37,406 --> 00:46:38,504
So that's the end.

769
00:46:38,505 --> 00:46:39,835
No, it's not.

770
00:46:40,275 --> 00:46:42,405
If you focused on the unidentified print,

771
00:46:42,406 --> 00:46:43,975
the result could have changed.

772
00:46:43,976 --> 00:46:46,045
Then the innocent man, Kim Dong Gu,

773
00:46:46,145 --> 00:46:48,445
wouldn't have been in prison for a crime he didn't commit.

774
00:46:48,686 --> 00:46:50,516
Then you should have kept trying.

775
00:46:52,215 --> 00:46:54,326
I wasn't his defence lawyer.

776
00:46:55,226 --> 00:46:56,485
You were.

777
00:47:01,096 --> 00:47:04,936
Professor Seo, someone's life depended on this trial.

778
00:47:07,065 --> 00:47:09,406
But the police or the prosecutors...

779
00:47:09,536 --> 00:47:10,835
didn't even...

780
00:47:11,775 --> 00:47:14,306
try to find out whose fingerprint it was. And that's the fact!

781
00:47:16,005 --> 00:47:18,516
What is this? Does he think he's Kim Dong Gu or what?

782
00:47:19,016 --> 00:47:22,445
Even if Kim Dong Gu's fingerprint was on the knife,

783
00:47:23,585 --> 00:47:25,456
you should have found out to whom...

784
00:47:26,255 --> 00:47:27,556
the unidentified fingerprint belonged.

785
00:47:28,226 --> 00:47:30,425
But covering that up as if it didn't matter...

786
00:47:30,426 --> 00:47:31,525
Who was it?

787
00:47:36,326 --> 00:47:38,465
- Who was it? - What do you mean?

788
00:47:39,335 --> 00:47:40,965
What are you asking?

789
00:47:41,065 --> 00:47:43,665
It was a year after Kim Dong Gu started serving time in prison.

790
00:47:44,605 --> 00:47:46,604
A TV program was about to air an episode,

791
00:47:46,605 --> 00:47:48,346
covering the possibility of Kim Dong Gu's innocence.

792
00:47:49,246 --> 00:47:50,274
No Byung Chul,

793
00:47:50,275 --> 00:47:52,245
a defendant you were investigating for another case,

794
00:47:52,246 --> 00:47:53,315
turned out to be the culprit.

795
00:47:54,286 --> 00:47:57,186
He willingly confessed to everything.

796
00:47:58,585 --> 00:48:01,485
Someone framed Kim Dong Gu, an innocent man, for the murder.

797
00:48:02,426 --> 00:48:04,394
And that someone made...

798
00:48:04,395 --> 00:48:06,395
No Byung Chul take the fall to cover that up.

799
00:48:08,165 --> 00:48:09,326
It wasn't you.

800
00:48:10,436 --> 00:48:12,266
You don't have the guts to do that.

801
00:48:13,465 --> 00:48:15,005
I'm sure there's someone behind you.

802
00:48:16,565 --> 00:48:17,636
Who is it?

803
00:48:27,315 --> 00:48:28,346
Gosh.

804
00:48:30,085 --> 00:48:33,015
Ms. Oh, you must be losing your cool after talking about...

805
00:48:33,016 --> 00:48:35,056
your humiliating past.

806
00:48:35,786 --> 00:48:37,425
Don't entertain this conspiracy thought.

807
00:48:37,426 --> 00:48:38,426
Just look at the facts.

808
00:48:40,156 --> 00:48:41,866
I crushed you at the trial.

809
00:48:43,065 --> 00:48:45,036
But I managed to catch the real culprit.

810
00:48:47,335 --> 00:48:48,636
That's the fact.

811
00:49:33,145 --> 00:49:34,746
Kim Dong Gu.

812
00:49:35,045 --> 00:49:36,145
This one.

813
00:49:36,915 --> 00:49:38,656
Purpose.

814
00:49:39,156 --> 00:49:40,255
Purpose.

815
00:49:40,956 --> 00:49:43,056
Experience... Why are there so many?

816
00:50:12,616 --> 00:50:14,624
Everything you know, everything you think you know,

817
00:50:14,625 --> 00:50:16,426
and your plan with Mr. Yoon.

818
00:50:16,826 --> 00:50:18,055
Tell me everything.

819
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,726
Don't leave anything out.

820
00:50:24,835 --> 00:50:26,335
Can you accompany me somewhere?

821
00:50:29,906 --> 00:50:33,476
(Kang Eun Seo)

822
00:50:44,456 --> 00:50:48,155
Right before she was in a car accident,

823
00:50:48,156 --> 00:50:51,156
I heard she went to a club with her friends.

824
00:50:52,096 --> 00:50:53,795
I started from there.

825
00:51:20,456 --> 00:51:23,886
All the security cameras in front of the club weren't working.

826
00:51:24,855 --> 00:51:28,065
And all the footage was deleted.

827
00:51:28,496 --> 00:51:31,565
Back then, the security cameras didn't cover every inch of the road.

828
00:51:32,436 --> 00:51:33,866
So I didn't get anything from there.

829
00:51:34,906 --> 00:51:38,005
Then I saw a vehicle passing in front of the club.

830
00:51:38,206 --> 00:51:40,676
I somehow managed to get its dashcam footage.

831
00:51:41,505 --> 00:51:43,775
But I couldn't make out their faces.

832
00:51:44,846 --> 00:51:46,976
I couldn't make out those three guys' faces.

833
00:51:48,485 --> 00:51:52,056
But I could recognize my daughter in the footage.

834
00:52:18,545 --> 00:52:19,615
Are you okay?

835
00:52:19,616 --> 00:52:21,815
Can I borrow your cell phone?

836
00:52:21,985 --> 00:52:23,115
My cell phone?

837
00:52:23,116 --> 00:52:26,655
That part-timer was Kim Dong Gu's younger sister.

838
00:52:26,656 --> 00:52:29,125
- It's cold. Put this on. - She was Jeon Na Jung.

839
00:52:30,156 --> 00:52:31,656
Wait here.

840
00:52:32,996 --> 00:52:35,395
Hey! Where is this wench?

841
00:52:36,165 --> 00:52:37,866
Hey! Catch her!

842
00:52:52,545 --> 00:52:53,545
(Jeon Na Jung)

843
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:55,915
Hey, let's go.

844
00:52:56,746 --> 00:52:57,985
Hey. Let's just go.

845
00:52:59,355 --> 00:53:00,585
Who's that girl?

846
00:53:01,525 --> 00:53:02,826
She saw everything.

847
00:53:04,726 --> 00:53:05,826
Choi Ju Wan,

848
00:53:07,156 --> 00:53:08,596
Han Dong O, and Lee Si Hyuk.

849
00:53:11,965 --> 00:53:15,005
Choi Ju Wan, Han Dong O,

850
00:53:16,366 --> 00:53:17,476
and Lee Si Hyuk?

851
00:53:17,605 --> 00:53:19,536
They kidnapped Eun Seo,

852
00:53:20,576 --> 00:53:22,275
but she ended up in an accident.

853
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:25,415
And Jeon Na Jung witnessed everything.

854
00:53:26,746 --> 00:53:28,545
So they couldn't just let her go.

855
00:53:29,815 --> 00:53:31,686
Knowing their fathers...

856
00:53:32,156 --> 00:53:34,386
Especially Choi Tae Guk who was a chief prosecutor...

857
00:53:34,886 --> 00:53:36,156
back then...

858
00:53:37,795 --> 00:53:39,025
wouldn't have...

859
00:53:39,726 --> 00:53:41,426
any problem framing...

860
00:53:41,525 --> 00:53:45,366
Kim Dong Gu for the crime his son and his son's friends committed.

861
00:53:53,436 --> 00:53:54,875
Go to the US.

862
00:53:55,306 --> 00:53:57,715
You can go there first. Ju Wan will follow you there.

863
00:53:59,145 --> 00:54:02,415
When you come back, you can have a proper wedding here.

864
00:54:07,525 --> 00:54:10,485
I'm having my son take care of it. My own son.

865
00:54:21,936 --> 00:54:23,936
Just go with the flow.

866
00:54:24,176 --> 00:54:26,604
Just go with the flow, wrap up this case,

867
00:54:26,605 --> 00:54:28,005
and go work at his law firm.

868
00:54:28,346 --> 00:54:29,806
He'll make you a successful lawyer.

869
00:54:55,806 --> 00:54:56,866
Ms. Oh.

870
00:54:59,476 --> 00:55:00,875
Why did you do it?

871
00:55:02,306 --> 00:55:03,645
"Just go with the flow."

872
00:55:04,945 --> 00:55:06,345
You said you would help me...

873
00:55:06,346 --> 00:55:08,516
get a job at TK Law Firm after the case.

874
00:55:09,215 --> 00:55:11,786
And when I kept arguing for Kim Dong Gu's innocence,

875
00:55:12,886 --> 00:55:15,585
you used my family to get your way,

876
00:55:15,926 --> 00:55:18,426
but you knew Kim Dong Gu wasn't the culprit.

877
00:55:19,625 --> 00:55:21,426
You told me to give up on him.

878
00:55:22,996 --> 00:55:24,465
Back then, Father...

879
00:55:24,735 --> 00:55:27,065
didn't want to fight a losing battle.

880
00:55:27,636 --> 00:55:29,135
Choi Tae Guk, Han Sung Bum, and Lee In Soo...

881
00:55:29,136 --> 00:55:30,665
were behind those three kids.

882
00:55:31,706 --> 00:55:34,405
Going after them without any concrete evidence...

883
00:55:34,406 --> 00:55:35,545
Shut it.

884
00:55:40,476 --> 00:55:43,985
An innocent man, Kim Dong Gu, had to suffer for a year in prison.

885
00:55:45,016 --> 00:55:48,455
And I threw myself at work, so I could stop feeling guilty.

886
00:55:48,456 --> 00:55:50,686
How could you keep it from me for a decade?

887
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,596
How could you live ten years, pleasing the three fathers...

888
00:55:54,395 --> 00:55:56,426
of the kids who hurt your daughter?

889
00:55:56,665 --> 00:56:00,295
I stopped him from going after them until we were fully ready.

890
00:56:01,835 --> 00:56:03,036
I asked him to do that.

891
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:05,806
I asked him to wait...

892
00:56:05,976 --> 00:56:08,206
until I had enough power to bring them down.

893
00:56:08,645 --> 00:56:09,875
Until you were ready?

894
00:56:11,645 --> 00:56:13,445
To take revenge for your daughter,

895
00:56:14,485 --> 00:56:16,915
you spent years getting ready.

896
00:56:17,755 --> 00:56:21,156
So you didn't care what happened to my innocent client's life?

897
00:56:23,956 --> 00:56:25,056
I did...

898
00:56:26,996 --> 00:56:28,295
wrong.

899
00:56:34,605 --> 00:56:35,605
What?

900
00:56:38,136 --> 00:56:39,936
Kim Dong Gu is alive?

901
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:42,706
- Yes. - Kim Dong Gu...

902
00:56:44,476 --> 00:56:46,275
is that guy, Gong Chan?

903
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:52,355
Come on.

904
00:56:54,556 --> 00:56:57,354
I'm sorry, sir. I'll handle this.

905
00:56:57,355 --> 00:56:58,695
Ten years ago,

906
00:56:59,656 --> 00:57:02,165
I trusted you and gave you this job. Did you forget that?

907
00:57:02,726 --> 00:57:05,766
I trusted you to handle a problem that could ruin my life!

908
00:57:05,936 --> 00:57:07,905
How could you fail me?

909
00:57:07,906 --> 00:57:09,235
How could you?

910
00:57:11,306 --> 00:57:12,735
I'm sorry, sir.

911
00:57:13,306 --> 00:57:14,806
I'll make sure to handle this.

912
00:57:14,945 --> 00:57:17,005
You can count on me. I swear it on my son's life.

913
00:57:19,775 --> 00:57:20,846
Why are you still here?

914
00:57:21,846 --> 00:57:25,255
You swore it on your son's life. You must be busy. Get out!

915
00:57:49,576 --> 00:57:51,076
What were you thinking?

916
00:57:52,846 --> 00:57:54,915
Why did you bring Professor Seo? Why did you bring that up?

917
00:57:56,415 --> 00:57:57,585
To let you know.

918
00:58:00,315 --> 00:58:01,855
To help you realize.

919
00:58:03,456 --> 00:58:05,496
But you were busy protecting Soo Jae.

920
00:58:06,556 --> 00:58:09,766
But then again, Soo Jae was doing the same thing.

921
00:58:13,335 --> 00:58:14,565
Kim Dong Gu.

922
00:58:17,775 --> 00:58:19,375
You deceived Soo Jae.

923
00:58:20,576 --> 00:58:21,945
And Soo Jae gave up on you.

924
00:58:23,545 --> 00:58:24,676
Soo Jae...

925
00:58:25,715 --> 00:58:26,945
gave up on you.

926
00:58:31,156 --> 00:58:33,215
(Soo Jae)

927
00:58:33,686 --> 00:58:35,456
You still don't see it?

928
00:58:37,085 --> 00:58:39,625
Soo Jae gave up on you during that trial!

929
00:58:40,096 --> 00:58:42,596
Because it was a complete defeat for her,

930
00:58:42,866 --> 00:58:45,766
she was able to join TK Law Firm and work under my father.

931
00:58:46,195 --> 00:58:48,605
What are you talking about?

932
00:58:49,766 --> 00:58:52,235
What is this about? Tell me everything you know.

933
00:58:52,335 --> 00:58:54,775
Her mother and brothers were arrested at that time.

934
00:58:55,676 --> 00:58:57,105
And she was offered a deal.

935
00:58:57,846 --> 00:59:00,145
Through her mentor, Director Baek,

936
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:04,246
she was told not to waste her effort on Kim Dong Gu's trial.

937
00:59:05,786 --> 00:59:07,715
Then her family would be released.

938
00:59:08,826 --> 00:59:10,785
Don't give me this nonsense...

939
00:59:10,786 --> 00:59:12,255
unless you can be responsible for it.

940
00:59:17,326 --> 00:59:18,536
This is why...

941
00:59:19,636 --> 00:59:21,136
you and Soo Jae can't work out.

942
00:59:23,036 --> 00:59:24,875
You deceived Soo Jae.

943
00:59:26,505 --> 00:59:28,105
And she gave up on you.

944
00:59:37,085 --> 00:59:38,286
I don't care.

945
00:59:43,156 --> 00:59:44,355
I don't care.

946
00:59:45,996 --> 00:59:48,496
If she had to give up on me to save her family,

947
00:59:49,965 --> 00:59:51,996
she made the right decision. She should have done that...

948
00:59:53,395 --> 00:59:54,806
because I would've done the same.

949
00:59:56,105 --> 00:59:57,536
Stop lying to yourself.

950
00:59:59,275 --> 01:00:01,246
Do you think using that logic to justify her decision...

951
01:00:02,045 --> 01:00:03,906
would make everything go away?

952
01:00:04,875 --> 01:00:05,875
You think I'm lying?

953
01:00:07,275 --> 01:00:09,715
The whole world deemed me the culprit.

954
01:00:10,215 --> 01:00:11,786
And even my own father didn't believe me.

955
01:00:12,255 --> 01:00:14,056
Do you know how miserable that makes you feel?

956
01:00:16,355 --> 01:00:18,425
Professor Oh was the only person...

957
01:00:18,426 --> 01:00:19,426
who believed me when I was in misery.

958
01:00:21,525 --> 01:00:22,866
You probably don't know that feeling.

959
01:00:24,295 --> 01:00:26,065
Hearing how someone believed me...

960
01:00:26,965 --> 01:00:29,036
helped me breathe and keep living.

961
01:00:30,665 --> 01:00:32,206
You can't even imagine that.

962
01:00:36,746 --> 01:00:39,145
You got framed because you let people walk all over you.

963
01:00:41,386 --> 01:00:44,346
People use you because you let people walk all over you!

964
01:00:44,915 --> 01:00:46,056
So what?

965
01:00:47,485 --> 01:00:49,125
Someone believed me.

966
01:00:50,726 --> 01:00:52,096
That's all I need.

967
01:00:53,525 --> 01:00:55,366
I don't care if she gave up on me...

968
01:00:56,866 --> 01:00:58,036
at the trial.

969
01:01:01,306 --> 01:01:02,366
You're crazy.

970
01:01:12,346 --> 01:01:15,985
Hearing how someone believed me helped me breathe and keep living.

971
01:01:16,315 --> 01:01:17,645
That's all I need.

972
01:01:22,386 --> 01:01:23,885
(Oh Soo Jae, argued for my innocence, but lost)

973
01:01:23,886 --> 01:01:25,455
(A lawyer at TK Law Firm)

974
01:01:25,456 --> 01:01:28,366
(The one who believed me to the end)

975
01:01:38,706 --> 01:01:41,746
(Why Her?)

976
01:02:01,866 --> 01:02:02,866
My decision...

977
01:02:02,867 --> 01:02:05,234
put Kim Dong Gu in pure torment.

978
01:02:05,235 --> 01:02:08,164
I know what kind of person you are. So I don't care.

979
01:02:08,165 --> 01:02:10,636
I'm so sorry.

980
01:02:11,206 --> 01:02:14,374
Thank you so much for coming back to me,

981
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:16,044
my daughter.

982
01:02:16,045 --> 01:02:17,905
You knew it the moment you saw the skeleton, right?

983
01:02:17,906 --> 01:02:19,745
Because you failed to take care of that...

984
01:02:19,746 --> 01:02:20,845
You punk!

985
01:02:20,846 --> 01:02:22,914
I want to meet with Chairman Choi Tae Guk.

986
01:02:22,915 --> 01:02:24,754
Are we on the same side now?

987
01:02:24,755 --> 01:02:25,755
Not possible.

988
01:02:25,756 --> 01:02:27,214
Did you skip an important step...

989
01:02:27,215 --> 01:02:28,885
to frame the suspect as the culprit?

990
01:02:28,886 --> 01:02:30,055
I never did such a thing.

991
01:02:30,056 --> 01:02:31,694
I'll announce my ruling.

992
01:02:31,695 --> 01:02:33,656
How did No Byung Chul end up becoming the culprit?

993
01:02:34,025 --> 01:02:35,064
Kim Dong Gu.

994
01:02:35,065 --> 01:02:36,664
He coordinated everything.

995
01:02:36,665 --> 01:02:38,694
He will now be looking at Gong Chan.

996
01:02:38,695 --> 01:02:40,765
I had been neglecting it because I was scared of having regrets...

997
01:02:40,766 --> 01:02:42,105
at that moment.

998
01:02:42,235 --> 01:02:44,065
Now, I would like to have regrets.
