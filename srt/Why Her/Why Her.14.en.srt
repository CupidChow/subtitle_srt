(This is a work of fiction. All characters, places, incidents,)

2
00:00:11,604 --> 00:00:14,104
(and organizations portrayed in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:19,684
What's your point?

4
00:00:20,713 --> 00:00:22,454
Why are you beating around the bush?

5
00:00:23,213 --> 00:00:25,522
The moment I made the wrong decision...

6
00:00:25,523 --> 00:00:28,523
to save my mother and brothers.

7
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,022
I was afraid of regretting that moment,

8
00:00:33,023 --> 00:00:34,364
so I had been neglecting it.

9
00:00:36,334 --> 00:00:38,364
But now, I would like to regret it.

10
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:43,103
My foolish decision...

11
00:00:43,373 --> 00:00:45,803
caused an innocent man, Kim Dong Gu, to be found guilty.

12
00:00:47,504 --> 00:00:50,673
But the three suspects have been living such good lives.

13
00:00:51,743 --> 00:00:53,784
One of them is the son of a presidential candidate.

14
00:00:54,044 --> 00:00:56,184
And the other one is the heir of Hansu Group.

15
00:00:56,813 --> 00:00:58,053
And the last one...

16
00:00:59,983 --> 00:01:01,953
is the heir of TK Law Firm.

17
00:01:21,174 --> 00:01:24,043
Soo Jae, I don't know where you heard this nonsense.

18
00:01:25,383 --> 00:01:27,683
Let's say that what you're telling me is true.

19
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,754
But you won't be able to catch them.

20
00:01:33,353 --> 00:01:34,823
Especially Ju Wan.

21
00:01:36,553 --> 00:01:38,564
You will never be able to catch him.

22
00:01:47,803 --> 00:01:48,803
Jae Yi.

23
00:01:52,344 --> 00:01:54,004
She's your daughter.

24
00:01:58,814 --> 00:01:59,984
(Episode 14)

25
00:02:00,444 --> 00:02:01,584
Is that you, Soo Jae?

26
00:02:02,553 --> 00:02:05,624
Why did you do that to me?

27
00:02:06,254 --> 00:02:08,353
I'm sorry you had a stillbirth.

28
00:02:11,963 --> 00:02:13,323
But I was told...

29
00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:16,534
that I had a stillbirth.

30
00:02:17,534 --> 00:02:18,663
No.

31
00:02:21,034 --> 00:02:22,304
Then why...

32
00:02:25,673 --> 00:02:27,004
Why did you...

33
00:02:27,744 --> 00:02:31,082
You were far below my son's league.

34
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,913
That is why I couldn't let him marry you.

35
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,383
However, the situation has changed.

36
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:40,784
You have reached my standards, and Seung Yeon wants a divorce.

37
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,254
So in a way, I could say that the timing is ideal.

38
00:02:45,564 --> 00:02:46,923
You see, in life...

39
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:52,763
Look who's here. Say hello.

40
00:02:52,863 --> 00:02:54,732
Hello, ma'am.

41
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:56,673
My name is Choi Jae Yi.

42
00:02:57,974 --> 00:03:00,774
Marry Ju Wan and become a member of the family.

43
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:05,214
It'll be good for both of you.

44
00:03:19,524 --> 00:03:20,823
Ma'am!

45
00:03:22,863 --> 00:03:23,964
This is for you.

46
00:03:31,804 --> 00:03:34,103
Here's proof that you are Jae Yi's biological mother.

47
00:03:35,613 --> 00:03:37,273
(DNA Test Report)

48
00:03:37,274 --> 00:03:39,643
(99.99 percent match, biologically related)

49
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,883
Listen, Soo Jae.

50
00:03:44,883 --> 00:03:48,423
What you said about the woman in her 20s and Jeon Na Jung...

51
00:03:49,724 --> 00:03:53,594
I don't know exactly what you heard, but it's complete nonsense.

52
00:03:55,163 --> 00:03:58,804
And even if those three guys were involved in something like that,

53
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:01,274
digging into it would just be a waste of your time and energy.

54
00:04:06,143 --> 00:04:07,774
Focus on building your bright future.

55
00:04:08,744 --> 00:04:10,173
I'll help you move further up in the world.

56
00:04:10,913 --> 00:04:13,543
All the way to the top, where you never thought you'd reach.

57
00:04:14,113 --> 00:04:15,284
I'll take you there.

58
00:04:17,214 --> 00:04:18,323
You really...

59
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,223
disgust me.

60
00:04:31,463 --> 00:04:32,703
I never knew...

61
00:04:35,473 --> 00:04:37,804
I could loathe someone so much.

62
00:04:42,244 --> 00:04:43,414
You make me sick.

63
00:05:16,614 --> 00:05:17,744
Yes, Father.

64
00:05:22,554 --> 00:05:23,554
What?

65
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,794
Why would you tell Soo Jae about me?

66
00:05:31,023 --> 00:05:32,393
I'll come up now.

67
00:05:48,914 --> 00:05:52,083
Soo Jae, I don't know where you heard this nonsense.

68
00:05:52,314 --> 00:05:54,314
But you won't be able to catch them.

69
00:05:54,953 --> 00:05:56,213
Shut it.

70
00:05:56,684 --> 00:05:58,124
Especially Ju Wan.

71
00:05:59,883 --> 00:06:01,893
You will never be able to catch him.

72
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,323
Shut it!

73
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:18,874
I have a lot on my mind now too. Let's talk about Jae Yi later.

74
00:06:24,914 --> 00:06:26,343
Shut it.

75
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,453
I suggest you behave yourself, Soo Jae.

76
00:06:34,523 --> 00:06:36,294
I'm about to lose it too.

77
00:06:38,424 --> 00:06:40,494
My patience has its limits.

(Partner Lawyer Oh Soo Jae)

79
00:07:26,843 --> 00:07:28,114
Ma'am!

80
00:07:30,143 --> 00:07:31,174
Me?

81
00:07:46,624 --> 00:07:48,133
In 1, 2, 3.

82
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:56,833
I haven't confirmed it yet myself.

83
00:08:01,573 --> 00:08:02,874
I don't know for sure yet.

84
00:08:08,914 --> 00:08:09,914
Father.

85
00:08:11,484 --> 00:08:13,484
Why? Why did you do that?

86
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:15,023
Why, out of the blue?

87
00:08:15,153 --> 00:08:16,254
Soo Jae...

88
00:08:17,054 --> 00:08:19,093
is digging into the incident from that day, ten years ago.

89
00:08:19,593 --> 00:08:20,823
What do you mean...

90
00:08:25,804 --> 00:08:29,133
That incident? All of a sudden?

91
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:32,244
How did she find out?

92
00:08:53,963 --> 00:08:55,233
- Let's go. - Hey.

93
00:08:56,794 --> 00:08:59,233
The other girl you guys met that night. Not Jeon Na Jung.

94
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,904
The girl you guys dragged away.

95
00:09:03,034 --> 00:09:04,073
Who is she?

96
00:09:10,973 --> 00:09:13,483
I don't know what you're talking about.

97
00:09:20,554 --> 00:09:23,524
See the three guys in this photo? Who are they?

98
00:09:27,123 --> 00:09:28,934
I have no idea what this is about.

99
00:09:33,264 --> 00:09:36,674
The girl you guys dragged away from the club that night.

100
00:09:37,603 --> 00:09:38,603
Who's that girl?

101
00:09:40,473 --> 00:09:41,644
Who is she?

102
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:43,613
I don't know.

103
00:09:45,944 --> 00:09:48,684
Stop trying to be smart. Tell me the truth.

104
00:09:49,884 --> 00:09:50,914
Who is she?

105
00:09:54,323 --> 00:09:56,894
I don't know, Father. I have no clue.

106
00:09:57,253 --> 00:10:00,523
I have no idea what you're talking about right now.

107
00:10:00,524 --> 00:10:02,264
I don't know!

108
00:10:03,363 --> 00:10:06,063
If anyone ever asks you about what happened today,

109
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,404
just say that you don't know.

110
00:10:09,134 --> 00:10:10,373
Nothing else.

111
00:10:11,233 --> 00:10:14,944
Nothing happened today.

112
00:10:15,444 --> 00:10:16,473
Do you understand?

113
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:39,433
(Lee In Soo will make our country fair and new.)

114
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:41,403
No, Reporter Kim.

115
00:10:41,404 --> 00:10:43,472
Come on. Don't be like this.

116
00:10:43,473 --> 00:10:44,732
(Lee In Soo Granted Favours to Hansu Construction)

117
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:46,274
Granted favours? That's nonsense.

118
00:10:46,573 --> 00:10:48,473
Seriously, you're out of line.

119
00:10:48,544 --> 00:10:51,143
You can't go ahead and publish such fake news.

120
00:10:51,144 --> 00:10:53,183
You should've checked with us to verify the facts.

121
00:10:53,184 --> 00:10:55,753
Why is Yeongpyeong District all over the news now?

122
00:10:55,853 --> 00:10:58,154
You should've kept the media out in advance.

123
00:10:58,384 --> 00:11:00,583
Shouldn't you do your job as the Chief Legal Officer?

124
00:11:00,924 --> 00:11:02,793
I'm about to go into an emergency meeting.

125
00:11:02,794 --> 00:11:03,794
The situation is worse over here!

126
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:05,093
Darn it.

127
00:11:06,024 --> 00:11:07,992
You should've taken care of the media outlets...

128
00:11:07,993 --> 00:11:08,993
before they published it!

129
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:13,063
Hey, call Soo Jae now.

130
00:11:13,064 --> 00:11:16,034
She's a pro at weaselling out of stuff like this. Call her, okay?

131
00:11:16,703 --> 00:11:20,044
A pro, my foot. Does he think she's almighty or something?

132
00:11:20,073 --> 00:11:22,373
Exactly. The party must step in and help me get this sorted out.

133
00:11:22,873 --> 00:11:24,713
If I go down, the party will go down too!

134
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,843
Darn it!

135
00:11:28,014 --> 00:11:29,784
Pull an all-nighter and come up with a plan!

136
00:11:29,853 --> 00:11:30,884
Hurry up and come in.

137
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:33,352
Where did Ms. Jung go?

138
00:11:33,353 --> 00:11:34,953
I'm here, sir!

139
00:11:36,524 --> 00:11:39,323
Come back with Jae Yi at once. I'll tell you when you're here.

140
00:11:39,723 --> 00:11:42,164
Just wait until I decide to go back.

141
00:11:42,394 --> 00:11:45,003
I don't even want to know why you're suddenly being like this.

142
00:11:46,134 --> 00:11:47,703
Is that so? You're not even curious?

143
00:11:49,274 --> 00:11:52,174
Listen carefully, then. Jae Yi is Soo Jae's daughter.

144
00:11:54,073 --> 00:11:56,014
See? You're at a loss for words.

145
00:11:56,944 --> 00:11:58,414
Don't be so surprised.

146
00:11:58,613 --> 00:12:01,044
No one can be more shocked than Soo Jae is right now.

147
00:12:01,343 --> 00:12:03,414
She found out today too.

148
00:12:05,453 --> 00:12:06,883
What? Do you think I'm crazy?

149
00:12:06,884 --> 00:12:08,222
My father told her.

150
00:12:08,223 --> 00:12:10,852
He told Soo Jae that Jae Yi is her child.

151
00:12:10,853 --> 00:12:12,623
So come back at once.

152
00:12:14,264 --> 00:12:15,694
Darn, this is nuts.

153
00:12:21,603 --> 00:12:24,034
Ju Wan, what did I hear just now?

154
00:12:28,243 --> 00:12:30,072
What did I just hear?

155
00:12:30,073 --> 00:12:31,943
You heard everything. Why are you asking?

156
00:12:31,944 --> 00:12:33,113
Are you sure?

157
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:37,613
Is it true? Is Soo Jae really Jae Yi's...

158
00:12:42,823 --> 00:12:44,993
Yes, Soo Jae is Jae Yi's biological mother.

159
00:12:47,024 --> 00:12:49,533
She went to the US years ago to give birth to Jae Yi.

160
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:50,894
Father sent her to the US.

161
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:54,134
Soo Jae was naive.

162
00:12:54,764 --> 00:12:56,673
Father told her to go to the US.

163
00:12:56,674 --> 00:12:57,933
"Give birth to your baby there,"

164
00:12:57,934 --> 00:13:00,003
"get married, and come back with Ju Wan."

165
00:13:04,274 --> 00:13:05,843
Father did everything.

166
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,612
He hid the baby away from her,

167
00:13:07,613 --> 00:13:09,384
and she thought she had a stillbirth.

168
00:13:09,784 --> 00:13:12,083
And you just moved on as if nothing ever happened?

169
00:13:13,123 --> 00:13:16,024
How could you eat and sleep?

170
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:18,723
How could you?

171
00:13:18,863 --> 00:13:20,863
How could anyone do something like that?

172
00:13:21,024 --> 00:13:22,663
I told you it wasn't me.

173
00:13:22,664 --> 00:13:25,233
Father did everything! It was him!

174
00:13:30,073 --> 00:13:31,404
You little...

175
00:13:32,373 --> 00:13:33,743
Beg her on your knees.

176
00:13:36,174 --> 00:13:38,144
Apologize to Soo Jae.

177
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:40,483
Apologize?

178
00:13:41,814 --> 00:13:44,613
Father is the only person who can make me apologize.

179
00:13:44,953 --> 00:13:46,053
- What? - Don't pretend...

180
00:13:46,054 --> 00:13:47,383
you're any different.

181
00:13:47,384 --> 00:13:50,924
Father has both of us in the palm of his hand.

182
00:13:52,823 --> 00:13:54,492
And stop having a crush on Soo Jae.

183
00:13:54,493 --> 00:13:57,694
Do you think it's normal to still have a crush on your tutor?

184
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:00,034
Come to your senses, you idiot.

185
00:14:20,684 --> 00:14:24,154
He won't think that he's managed to silence me for good.

186
00:14:32,764 --> 00:14:34,934
He'll try to find out who the 20-something woman was.

187
00:14:37,174 --> 00:14:39,274
He'll get busy.

188
00:14:48,953 --> 00:14:49,983
Ms. Oh.

189
00:14:57,253 --> 00:14:58,894
How about I drive you home?

190
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:05,564
The bait has been thrown, so Chairman Choi will make a move.

191
00:15:06,264 --> 00:15:07,634
Tell everyone to be careful.

192
00:15:09,434 --> 00:15:11,473
Is there something else going on?

193
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,174
Is there anything I can help you with?

194
00:15:15,674 --> 00:15:17,473
I should drop you off at the subway station, right?

195
00:15:20,314 --> 00:15:21,343
Yes.

196
00:15:29,894 --> 00:15:31,252
They were digging on the land I own.

197
00:15:31,253 --> 00:15:33,794
Who knew that girl's skeleton would turn up?

198
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:37,193
You said you'd take care of it.

199
00:15:37,194 --> 00:15:38,764
Why was it found there of all places?

200
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:41,304
I wonder too.

201
00:15:42,473 --> 00:15:46,044
How could you say that so nonchalantly?

202
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,572
I've suddenly been accused of granting favours...

203
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:49,743
regarding Yeongpyeong District.

204
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:52,443
The presidential election is just around the corner.

205
00:15:52,444 --> 00:15:53,843
Why is this happening now?

206
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:56,784
I wonder too.

207
00:15:59,654 --> 00:16:00,753
Chairman Choi.

208
00:16:01,924 --> 00:16:03,054
Have you sobered up?

209
00:16:14,664 --> 00:16:15,832
What are you guys doing here?

210
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,233
Chairman Choi, did you call them here?

211
00:16:21,774 --> 00:16:23,144
You guys must remember...

212
00:16:25,243 --> 00:16:28,444
the day you met me ten years ago.

213
00:16:32,823 --> 00:16:35,154
Hey, wake up.

214
00:16:40,993 --> 00:16:44,233
It wasn't me. I swear, I tried to stop them.

215
00:16:45,434 --> 00:16:46,634
I didn't do anything either.

216
00:16:47,434 --> 00:16:50,873
Ju Wan, that jerk. He went all crazy and...

217
00:16:50,904 --> 00:16:54,274
No, Father. It wasn't me.

218
00:16:57,243 --> 00:16:58,274
Father.

219
00:16:59,944 --> 00:17:00,983
Hands down.

220
00:17:02,284 --> 00:17:03,384
Put your hands down!

221
00:17:06,953 --> 00:17:08,054
Father, I...

222
00:17:09,124 --> 00:17:10,124
Father.

223
00:17:11,424 --> 00:17:13,963
Before you guys met Jeon Na Jung that night,

224
00:17:14,864 --> 00:17:18,563
you met a woman at the club and dragged her there.

225
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,164
Right?

226
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:26,104
- What are you talking about? - Hang on, Chairman Choi.

227
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:28,073
What are you saying?

228
00:17:28,074 --> 00:17:30,012
What is this nonsense about?

229
00:17:30,013 --> 00:17:32,783
Before the convenience store part-timer Jeon Na Jung,

230
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,614
did you guys drag another woman there or not?

231
00:17:39,523 --> 00:17:41,654
Hey, what's going on?

232
00:17:42,223 --> 00:17:43,654
Shut it, you idiot.

233
00:17:45,763 --> 00:17:47,864
The woman you met at the club. What was her name?

234
00:17:48,523 --> 00:17:50,164
How would we know?

235
00:17:50,664 --> 00:17:52,634
It's not like we exchanged names before we dragged her out.

236
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:55,374
Shoot.

237
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,473
But that girl...

238
00:18:00,043 --> 00:18:01,843
got away...

239
00:18:01,844 --> 00:18:04,513
while you guys were all dazed and high on drugs.

240
00:18:05,783 --> 00:18:08,614
What did you do when you realized that she had escaped?

241
00:18:10,154 --> 00:18:11,354
What did you guys do?

242
00:18:17,553 --> 00:18:18,723
We went after her.

243
00:18:19,993 --> 00:18:22,063
Then I think she got into a car accident.

244
00:18:23,694 --> 00:18:26,133
- Right? - I don't know.

245
00:18:26,134 --> 00:18:28,674
Hey, what do you mean you don't know?

246
00:18:28,973 --> 00:18:30,574
You drove that day.

247
00:18:30,703 --> 00:18:33,803
You were the one who dragged the part-timer over to us.

248
00:18:35,003 --> 00:18:36,542
I have no idea what you're talking about.

249
00:18:36,543 --> 00:18:38,243
Choi Ju Wan, you scumbag.

250
00:18:38,644 --> 00:18:40,242
Are you trying to weasel out of this alone?

251
00:18:40,243 --> 00:18:42,313
Choi Ju Wan, you psycho.

252
00:18:42,584 --> 00:18:44,053
You idiot!

253
00:18:44,753 --> 00:18:46,883
Who else was there that night?

254
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:49,424
You fool! What were you thinking?

255
00:18:50,694 --> 00:18:52,624
Answer me! Who else was there?

256
00:18:52,793 --> 00:18:55,463
- You stupid idiot! - Father!

257
00:18:55,793 --> 00:18:58,232
- Who else was there? - You fool!

258
00:18:58,233 --> 00:19:00,163
Must you ruin everything I've worked so hard for?

259
00:19:00,164 --> 00:19:01,702
How dare you!

260
00:19:01,703 --> 00:19:03,273
Stop!

261
00:19:04,033 --> 00:19:05,233
That's enough!

262
00:19:06,003 --> 00:19:07,074
Darn you!

263
00:19:07,404 --> 00:19:09,374
That's enough. Please sit down, both of you.

264
00:19:09,444 --> 00:19:10,743
You little...

265
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:15,813
- Darn it. - Unbelievable!

266
00:19:26,793 --> 00:19:29,634
Who else did you meet before you met Jeon Na Jung that night?

267
00:19:35,364 --> 00:19:36,834
I don't know...

268
00:19:38,104 --> 00:19:39,303
what you're talking about.

269
00:19:44,874 --> 00:19:46,114
That should be your answer.

270
00:19:46,584 --> 00:19:49,914
I don't care who you met or how many girls you met that night.

271
00:19:50,553 --> 00:19:51,983
You guys...

272
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:54,824
don't know what happened that night.

273
00:19:56,354 --> 00:19:57,453
Do you understand?

274
00:19:59,463 --> 00:20:00,523
Do you understand?

275
00:20:01,124 --> 00:20:02,334
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

276
00:20:04,434 --> 00:20:05,563
Get out, all of you.

277
00:20:26,084 --> 00:20:29,793
Chairman Choi, you have a lot on your plate.

278
00:20:31,124 --> 00:20:33,993
Chairman Choi, please take good care of this.

279
00:20:35,223 --> 00:20:37,833
We want things to go smoothly for all three of us.

280
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:38,904
That's right.

281
00:20:46,543 --> 00:20:48,472
You nut job. Do you not have a brain?

282
00:20:48,473 --> 00:20:50,073
You brought up the car accident, jerk.

283
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:52,183
- Whatever. Get lost, jerk. - You get lost, jerk!

284
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,684
Shut it, loser!

285
00:20:55,184 --> 00:20:56,614
That idiot.

286
00:21:07,394 --> 00:21:09,063
Those idiots.

287
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:11,232
Hello.

288
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:12,663
I'm the spokesperson of Assemblyman Lee In Soo...

289
00:21:12,664 --> 00:21:15,134
of Together for Our Future. My name is Jung Hee Young.

290
00:21:15,703 --> 00:21:17,073
The alleged preferential treatment in Yeongpyeong District...

291
00:21:17,074 --> 00:21:18,473
has caught our attention recently.

292
00:21:18,604 --> 00:21:20,473
But it's nothing but fake news.

293
00:21:20,803 --> 00:21:23,542
- Candidate Lee has nothing... - Let's go.

294
00:21:23,543 --> 00:21:25,143
- to do with the scandal. - Gosh. Let's go.

295
00:21:25,144 --> 00:21:27,913
Sir, you have to settle your tab.

296
00:21:27,914 --> 00:21:29,883
- We're regulars here. - Come on.

297
00:21:29,884 --> 00:21:31,313
- Bye. - Goodness.

298
00:21:31,354 --> 00:21:33,353
Hey, we're doing this to make money.

299
00:21:33,354 --> 00:21:34,552
Why are you giving out free food?

300
00:21:34,553 --> 00:21:36,623
We're supposed to give out freebies!

301
00:21:36,624 --> 00:21:38,863
- That's why you can't save money. - What do you mean?

302
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,962
- Come on. Fine! - Clean that up already.

303
00:21:41,963 --> 00:21:43,694
(Fried chicken, beer, and coffee)

304
00:21:48,563 --> 00:21:51,174
Goodness. What a surprise.

305
00:21:51,503 --> 00:21:53,174
What brings you here?

306
00:22:04,414 --> 00:22:06,953
You didn't even come when we opened. What brings you here at this hour?

307
00:22:08,184 --> 00:22:11,553
Are you here to take this back from us?

308
00:22:18,664 --> 00:22:19,733
Mom.

309
00:22:21,364 --> 00:22:24,104
Are you sick? Is it life-threatening?

310
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:26,444
What's wrong with you?

311
00:22:26,674 --> 00:22:27,904
What is it?

312
00:22:29,914 --> 00:22:32,243
Come on. What's wrong with you?

313
00:22:38,154 --> 00:22:40,253
What did the doctor say? Is it serious?

314
00:22:41,084 --> 00:22:44,753
No. I'm taking you to the doctor tomorrow. Okay?

315
00:22:44,924 --> 00:22:46,124
Let's go to the hospital.

316
00:22:47,063 --> 00:22:50,664
No. I just wanted to stop by. You told me to stop by.

317
00:22:51,293 --> 00:22:52,404
Really?

318
00:22:53,434 --> 00:22:54,904
You just came to visit?

319
00:23:01,703 --> 00:23:02,743
I'll get going.

320
00:23:07,184 --> 00:23:08,243
Work hard.

321
00:23:16,154 --> 00:23:18,493
Mom, something is off about her.

322
00:23:19,463 --> 00:23:21,723
She smiled at us sweetly.

323
00:23:22,293 --> 00:23:24,934
It's been over a decade since she smiled at us like that.

324
00:23:26,434 --> 00:23:27,733
Right.

325
00:23:39,444 --> 00:23:41,114
(Im Seung Yeon)

326
00:23:46,684 --> 00:23:48,723
- Hello? - Unbelievable.

327
00:23:49,894 --> 00:23:51,854
How could you not have known?

328
00:23:52,053 --> 00:23:55,263
How could you not have recognized your own daughter?

329
00:23:55,993 --> 00:23:57,063
How do you call yourself her mother?

330
00:23:58,233 --> 00:23:59,634
I might not be her mother.

331
00:24:00,803 --> 00:24:01,834
What?

332
00:24:03,033 --> 00:24:05,533
I didn't run the test myself. How could I trust him?

333
00:24:07,074 --> 00:24:08,543
I don't believe it yet.

334
00:24:10,273 --> 00:24:11,543
Forget it.

335
00:24:12,513 --> 00:24:15,713
No one is taking Jae Yi from me. None of you deserves her.

336
00:24:37,574 --> 00:24:40,444
The night Jeon Na Jung died,

337
00:24:41,844 --> 00:24:44,144
the three of them took a girl from a club...

338
00:24:45,043 --> 00:24:47,884
to Chairman Han's house in Samjung-dong.

339
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:53,283
When she was running away, she got into a car accident.

340
00:24:54,654 --> 00:24:57,154
Find out if she's alive or dead.

341
00:24:58,694 --> 00:25:01,792
Even if she's alive, seeing how she hasn't said...

342
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:02,864
What?

343
00:25:03,864 --> 00:25:06,604
Hey. So what are you saying?

344
00:25:08,563 --> 00:25:10,934
Nothing, sir. I'll look into it.

345
00:25:11,203 --> 00:25:14,743
Jeon Na Jung. And Kim Dong Gu.

346
00:25:16,174 --> 00:25:17,174
Seriously.

347
00:25:17,844 --> 00:25:20,543
I have all the reasons to fire you.

348
00:25:22,043 --> 00:25:23,483
Come on.

349
00:25:41,364 --> 00:25:42,404
Go.

350
00:25:45,374 --> 00:25:46,444
Sir.

351
00:25:46,674 --> 00:25:48,144
- Il Gu. - Yes.

352
00:25:50,013 --> 00:25:51,013
Go.

353
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:30,854
Darn it.

354
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:35,854
I'm so exhausted.

355
00:26:44,834 --> 00:26:47,263
The 3 suspects raped a woman in her 20s...

356
00:26:47,334 --> 00:26:48,962
and murdered Jeon Na Jung.

357
00:26:48,963 --> 00:26:51,803
But the three suspects have been living such good lives.

358
00:26:52,303 --> 00:26:54,104
One of them is the son of a presidential candidate.

359
00:26:54,473 --> 00:26:56,644
And the other one is the heir of Hansu Group.

360
00:26:56,973 --> 00:27:00,243
And the last one is the heir of TK Law Firm.

361
00:27:01,213 --> 00:27:02,953
She doesn't know her place.

362
00:27:04,253 --> 00:27:05,253
Darn it.

363
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:07,884
How dare she?

364
00:28:01,273 --> 00:28:02,574
You really came.

365
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,283
When I read your text this morning, I found it a bit ridiculous.

366
00:28:09,184 --> 00:28:12,414
You wanted me to get Jae Yi's hair, so you could run a maternity test.

367
00:28:14,824 --> 00:28:16,354
Do you think how pathetic this is?

368
00:28:17,453 --> 00:28:18,624
Mom.

369
00:28:24,094 --> 00:28:25,163
What about your grandma?

370
00:28:25,164 --> 00:28:27,164
She went to the restroom.

371
00:28:33,644 --> 00:28:37,374
Jae Yi. Why don't you go and play at the beach with her?

372
00:28:37,773 --> 00:28:39,344
I'll meet you there with your grandma.

373
00:28:43,084 --> 00:28:44,114
Wait.

374
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:49,124
Ma'am, did you come here because you wanted to see me?

375
00:28:50,993 --> 00:28:52,094
Yes.

376
00:28:52,453 --> 00:28:54,894
Let's go to the beach and play together.

377
00:29:21,624 --> 00:29:23,723
Do you want me to carry you?

378
00:29:31,164 --> 00:29:32,293
All right.

379
00:29:39,703 --> 00:29:42,074
Ma'am, aren't I heavy?

380
00:29:43,444 --> 00:29:44,542
You are.

381
00:29:44,543 --> 00:29:47,313
Right? I've gotten taller.

382
00:29:48,543 --> 00:29:51,584
I want to be tall just like you.

383
00:29:57,354 --> 00:29:59,493
Why didn't I recognize you?

384
00:30:14,644 --> 00:30:17,513
Ma'am, there are so many pretty shells here.

385
00:30:22,983 --> 00:30:25,753
Ma'am, this is for you.

386
00:30:27,324 --> 00:30:29,324
Gosh. Thank you.

387
00:30:33,793 --> 00:30:34,894
Jae Yi.

388
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:38,334
Mom! Grandma!

389
00:30:39,434 --> 00:30:40,563
Jae Yi.

390
00:30:42,934 --> 00:30:44,533
I was happy to see you.

391
00:30:45,233 --> 00:30:47,344
Ma'am, are you going home now?

392
00:30:47,543 --> 00:30:48,543
Yes.

393
00:30:51,513 --> 00:30:55,684
Let's have a delicious meal and play more next time.

395
00:31:01,084 --> 00:31:02,253
A pinky promise.

396
00:31:07,463 --> 00:31:08,594
Mom.

397
00:31:36,523 --> 00:31:38,753
You'll find Jae Yi's hair and toothbrush inside the envelope.

398
00:31:40,424 --> 00:31:43,293
Oh Soo Jae, you're so foolish.

399
00:31:44,894 --> 00:31:46,702
The day I took the photo of you and Jae Yi,

400
00:31:46,703 --> 00:31:49,503
my heart sank.

401
00:31:54,303 --> 00:31:57,643
She's usually very shy, but she was friendly with you.

402
00:31:57,644 --> 00:31:58,844
I wondered why.

403
00:32:00,283 --> 00:32:02,584
Clearly, she instinctively knew.

404
00:32:03,813 --> 00:32:05,513
So why do you even need those things?

405
00:32:06,783 --> 00:32:09,154
I'm so upset because she looks just like you.

406
00:32:32,114 --> 00:32:34,944
Ms. Oh told you to meet me?

407
00:32:35,614 --> 00:32:37,313
"Don't trust him."

Those were Ms. Oh's words.

411
00:32:53,364 --> 00:32:54,404
Recant it, and then what?

412
00:32:54,834 --> 00:32:58,104
Oh, there was something else she said.

413
00:32:58,503 --> 00:33:02,973
"Only a moron would trust Seo Jun Myeong."

414

417
00:33:18,654 --> 00:33:19,863
You're here too? What's up?

418
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:22,594
What? "You're here too?"

419
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,992
That means someone else was here too.

No matter what you ask me, my answer will be "I don't know."

We met in court.

00:38:33,474 --> 00:38:36,042
If Choi Tae Guk fails to carry out Clause 1 and 2...

498
00:38:36,043 --> 00:38:37,913
by the date specified above...

499
00:38:38,174 --> 00:38:39,643
or makes any changes after carrying out the terms,

500
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:43,454
Oh Soo Jae will no longer be bound by the confidentiality agreement.

501
00:38:52,353 --> 00:38:54,963
You're using your daughter to cut a deal with me.

502
00:38:55,094 --> 00:38:57,594
I'll do a good job as the firm's managing partner...

503
00:38:57,994 --> 00:38:59,293
and raise Jae Yi well...

504
00:39:00,134 --> 00:39:01,363
as my daughter.

505
00:39:01,364 --> 00:39:03,273
So you want this old man to step down and retire.

506
00:39:03,304 --> 00:39:05,473
I will treat you politely, as the firm's honorary chairman.

507
00:39:05,474 --> 00:39:07,142
I'll give you the 70 million dollars you want.

508
00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:08,743
Isn't that enough?

509
00:39:08,744 --> 00:39:10,913
Yes. Give it to me.

510
00:39:11,944 --> 00:39:13,073
Give me the 70 million dollars...

511
00:39:13,074 --> 00:39:14,983
and sign the document. Give me everything I want.

512
00:39:16,413 --> 00:39:18,082
You know what you did to me.

513
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:19,752
You should give me whatever I ask for.

514
00:39:19,753 --> 00:39:21,424
Assemblyman Lee is the one running for President,

515
00:39:22,123 --> 00:39:25,753
but I'll use him as my stepping stone to make that place mine.

516
00:39:26,893 --> 00:39:29,994
I can help you soar higher and achieve bigger things.

517
00:39:33,733 --> 00:39:36,233
You know what's so fascinating?

518
00:39:37,674 --> 00:39:41,173
Whenever we're approaching a presidential election,

519
00:39:41,174 --> 00:39:42,904
I wonder, "How did that scumbag even get nominated?"

520
00:39:43,174 --> 00:39:46,614
It's beyond ridiculous, but it happens every five years.

521
00:39:47,784 --> 00:39:49,784
Some of them even manage to get elected.

522
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:52,554
So stay hopeful.

523
00:39:54,154 --> 00:39:56,793
And make sure you sign that agreement.

524
00:39:58,654 --> 00:40:01,062
Do you really think I'll accept these terms?

525
00:40:01,063 --> 00:40:03,793
Yes. You have no choice.

526
00:40:07,163 --> 00:40:09,973
Here's the result of a paternity test for the foetus...

527
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:11,304
in Park So Young's womb.

(DNA Test Report)

529
00:40:14,174 --> 00:40:16,844
(Sample 1 and 2 are not biologically related.)

530
00:40:17,514 --> 00:40:19,713
Who is the father?

531
00:40:21,913 --> 00:40:24,913
At first, I thought it was Chairman Han. But I was wrong.

532
00:40:27,253 --> 00:40:28,924
I wasted my time.

533
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,824
So I ran the test on someone else.

534
00:40:33,994 --> 00:40:36,663
"There is..."

535
00:40:37,163 --> 00:40:41,864
"a 99.98-percent probability that 1 and 2 are biologically related."

536
00:40:42,864 --> 00:40:44,404
Sample One was from the foetus,

537
00:40:45,174 --> 00:40:46,603
and Sample Two was...

538
00:40:47,974 --> 00:40:49,272
(DNA Test Report)

539
00:40:49,273 --> 00:40:51,014
From you, Chairman Choi Tae Guk.

00:40:54,284 --> 00:40:55,844
(DNA Test Report)

541
00:40:55,884 --> 00:40:59,014
(Sample 1 and 2 are biologically related.)

542
00:40:59,213 --> 00:41:00,352
You used Park So Young...

543
00:41:00,353 --> 00:41:02,122
to manufacture the scandal involving An Kang Won.

544
00:41:02,123 --> 00:41:04,694
Then you called her here and brutally murdered her.

545
00:41:06,523 --> 00:41:08,694
You think I haven't found evidence...

546
00:41:09,094 --> 00:41:10,694
that you killed Park So Young?

547
00:41:10,764 --> 00:41:11,764
You...

548
00:41:17,974 --> 00:41:22,003
"How could he lie to me that I had a stillbirth?"

549
00:41:22,873 --> 00:41:26,113
"How could he not even show it once, for all these years?"

550
00:41:26,114 --> 00:41:28,483
"How could anyone do such a thing?"

551
00:41:29,014 --> 00:41:31,413
I was confused, but it all became very clear to me quickly.

552
00:41:33,353 --> 00:41:34,454
That's right.

553
00:41:35,123 --> 00:41:38,393
You killed the woman who was pregnant with your child.

554
00:41:39,023 --> 00:41:41,363
After murdering the woman carrying your child in her womb,

555
00:41:41,364 --> 00:41:43,324
you acted as if nothing happened.

556
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,932
There is nothing you can't do...

557
00:41:45,933 --> 00:41:49,034
if it's for your own gain.

558
00:41:56,773 --> 00:41:59,273
I knew you'd figure it out once you set your mind to it.

559
00:41:59,974 --> 00:42:01,413
So you're giving me this...

560
00:42:02,844 --> 00:42:04,083
because you're making an offer.

561
00:42:05,014 --> 00:42:06,413
An offer for a deal.

562
00:42:08,054 --> 00:42:10,293
I'll give you two hours to sign it.

563
00:42:12,094 --> 00:42:13,623
This isn't an offer.

564
00:42:14,594 --> 00:42:15,824
It's an order.

565
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:38,154
- Yes. - Secretaries' Office.

566
00:42:38,384 --> 00:42:40,383
We need to check if it's true or not first.

567
00:42:40,384 --> 00:42:42,153
- No. We'll take care of it... - We can't give you an answer yet.

568
00:42:42,154 --> 00:42:43,154
- once we access the situation. - Right.

569
00:42:43,155 --> 00:42:44,954
- Okay. - We'll do that next.

570
00:42:45,154 --> 00:42:47,194
- Hold on. - Secretaries' Office.

571
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:50,194
- What? - We can't confirm that right now.

572
00:42:50,463 --> 00:42:52,332
- Yes. - Hold on.

573
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:55,433
We're still checking if it's true or not.

574
00:43:01,444 --> 00:43:02,943
We have news about Candidate Lee In Soo.

575
00:43:02,944 --> 00:43:05,542
The daughter of Candidate Lee works as the team leader of Planning...

576
00:43:05,543 --> 00:43:06,772
at Hansu Group's subsidiary.

577
00:43:06,773 --> 00:43:09,412
And a suspicion that she received a four-million-dollar bonus...

578
00:43:09,413 --> 00:43:11,783
for her performance in promoting Yeongpyeong District...

579
00:43:11,784 --> 00:43:12,853
has been raised.

580
00:43:13,253 --> 00:43:14,553
On top of that, Candidate Lee's mother-in-law...

581
00:43:14,554 --> 00:43:17,093
is suspected to have bought three private apartment units...

582
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,853
which will be built soon in Yeongpyeong at give away prices.

583
00:43:19,994 --> 00:43:22,863
As of now, his approval ratings are at 43.2 percent.

584
00:43:22,864 --> 00:43:25,364
Candidate Lee is leading the campaign.

585
00:43:26,163 --> 00:43:27,232
Once Hansu Construction won...

586
00:43:27,233 --> 00:43:28,763
the development project in Yeonpyeong District,

587
00:43:28,764 --> 00:43:31,033
they lobbied to influence the formation of the consortium.

588
00:43:31,034 --> 00:43:32,573
Former Chief Justice Kim Do Il,

589
00:43:32,574 --> 00:43:34,344
Former Director of National Tax Service Jang Man Young,

590
00:43:34,503 --> 00:43:36,372
Former Presidential Senior Secretary Woo Sang Soo,

591
00:43:36,373 --> 00:43:39,574
and Former Minister of Justice Cha Won Seok have been mentioned.

592
00:43:39,844 --> 00:43:41,743
They are suspected to have received...

593
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:44,614
from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars.

594
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,954
Darn it. Come on.

595
00:43:52,023 --> 00:43:54,963
The reporters have been calling us regarding the advisors.

596
00:43:55,264 --> 00:43:56,694
And Director Han Dong O...

597
00:43:56,824 --> 00:43:59,634
secretly filmed the women he has been dating so far.

598
00:44:00,233 --> 00:44:01,534
That's in the tabloids now.

599
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:17,213
("Hansu Construction Is Suspected to Lobby TK Law Firm's Advisors")

600
00:44:17,284 --> 00:44:19,053
The stock prices of Hansu Construction,

601
00:44:19,054 --> 00:44:21,224
Hansu Bio, and Hansu Group will start to plummet.

602
00:44:21,824 --> 00:44:24,153
They'll be busy trying to clean up the bomb in front of them.

603
00:44:24,154 --> 00:44:25,423
So they won't have the energy to dig into...

604
00:44:25,424 --> 00:44:26,824
the incident from ten years ago.

605
00:44:27,594 --> 00:44:29,162
And as for Yeongpyeong District,

606
00:44:29,163 --> 00:44:31,463
they basically dug up their own graves there.

607
00:44:32,494 --> 00:44:35,333
They are more than capable of covering up the graves.

608
00:44:37,103 --> 00:44:40,304
We should watch what happens for now until Director Baek's hearing.

609
00:44:40,603 --> 00:44:42,003
Let's see what they do.

610
00:44:42,174 --> 00:44:43,174
Okay.

611
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:44,872
We've made several moves.

612
00:44:44,873 --> 00:44:46,674
So it will be that much fun to watch them.

613

I need you to take a look at this.

614

I have to go.

and sign the document. Give me everything I want.

Stop.

I'm dying here. My father said he would kill me.

Hey, remember the photo Mr. Yoon gave you?

637

Take a photo of that and send it to me.

Get your father to call my father, you jerk!

She never comes to see me.

648

She suddenly came to me and was hesitant to say something.

Okay. I'll keep an eye on her.

Let's have dinner together.

(DNA Test Report)

660
00:48:38,713 --> 00:48:41,582
(Oh Soo Jae, Choi Jae Yi)

(Probability of maternity: 99.98 percent)

662
00:48:50,023 --> 00:48:51,654
(Chan: Let's have dinner together.)

663
00:48:53,654 --> 00:48:56,522
Sure. I have to talk to you too.

664
00:48:56,523 --> 00:49:00,804
(Sure. I have to talk to you too.)

665
00:49:11,344 --> 00:49:13,413
Gosh. Professor Oh is running late.

666
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:15,313
She must have hit traffic.

667
00:49:15,543 --> 00:49:17,883
I'm going to serve her a full-course meal today,

668
00:49:17,884 --> 00:49:19,514
so there isn't any space left in her stomach.

669
00:49:19,683 --> 00:49:21,352
Should we eat here? It's been a while.

670
00:49:21,353 --> 00:49:23,324
A full-course meal on the rooftop.

671
00:49:23,654 --> 00:49:24,793
There she comes.

672
00:49:24,924 --> 00:49:26,424
- Really? - She's coming?

673
00:49:29,694 --> 00:49:32,094
What? Why did she suddenly stop the car there?

674
00:49:32,463 --> 00:49:35,103
I don't know. Is something wrong?

675
00:49:39,974 --> 00:49:41,003
The line is busy.

676
00:49:41,543 --> 00:49:43,373
Jae Yi is gone.

677
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:45,912
Where was she? Why?

678
00:49:45,913 --> 00:49:48,312
When Seung Yeon stepped out and came back, Jae Yi wasn't home.

679
00:49:48,313 --> 00:49:49,643
She disappeared.

680
00:49:50,813 --> 00:49:51,853
Darn it.

681
00:49:55,054 --> 00:49:57,324
(Im Seung Yeon)

682
00:49:57,594 --> 00:50:00,224
What do I do? Jae Yi is gone.

683
00:50:00,994 --> 00:50:03,063
I called the police.

684
00:50:03,293 --> 00:50:04,463
But what do I do?

685
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:07,163
Where are you now? Send me the address now.

686
00:50:26,253 --> 00:50:27,253
The receiver cannot be reached.

687
00:50:28,023 --> 00:50:30,424
Sir, can you follow that car fast?

688
00:50:44,373 --> 00:50:45,404
No.

689
00:50:50,574 --> 00:50:51,713
Jae Yi!

690
00:50:52,913 --> 00:50:53,983
Jae Yi!

691
00:50:54,483 --> 00:50:56,313
Jae Yi.

692
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:01,784
Jae Yi!

693
00:51:03,824 --> 00:51:04,853
Jae Yi.

694
00:51:05,954 --> 00:51:06,994
Soo A.

695
00:51:07,224 --> 00:51:09,994
I'm sorry.

696
00:51:13,364 --> 00:51:15,463
You haven't found her yet? No one saw her?

697
00:51:17,264 --> 00:51:19,273
The security cameras. Did you go to the maintenance office?

698
00:51:19,603 --> 00:51:21,203
I'll watch the footage. Keep looking for her.

699
00:51:21,204 --> 00:51:22,744
Call me the moment you find her.

700
00:51:39,154 --> 00:51:40,253
Why isn't she answering?

701
00:51:51,534 --> 00:51:53,674
You haven't found her yet? Did you receive any calls?

702
00:51:53,733 --> 00:51:57,043
What do I do? I shouldn't have said anything.

703
00:51:57,844 --> 00:52:01,583
I told her I was going to the US by myself.

704
00:52:01,614 --> 00:52:03,884
I told her that she would live with her dad now.

705
00:52:05,054 --> 00:52:07,554
I said I would come and visit her from time to time.

706
00:52:09,853 --> 00:52:12,093
I thought it was only right that I broke it to her.

707
00:52:12,094 --> 00:52:15,594
I thought I had to make her understand no matter what.

708
00:52:15,994 --> 00:52:17,993
Did you check the security cameras?

709
00:52:17,994 --> 00:52:19,994
Ju Wan is checking them now.

710
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:27,203
The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail.

711
00:52:27,204 --> 00:52:29,474
Which way is Jae Yi's school?

712
00:52:29,744 --> 00:52:31,613
She goes to Jangmi Elementary School.

713
00:52:31,614 --> 00:52:32,812
It's that way.

714
00:52:32,813 --> 00:52:34,182
But I don't think she went there.

715
00:52:34,183 --> 00:52:37,142
I'll check just in case. You should check someplace else.

716
00:52:37,143 --> 00:52:38,653
Call me if you find her.

717
00:52:38,654 --> 00:52:39,683
Of course.

718
00:52:42,224 --> 00:52:43,424
(Gong Chan)

719
00:52:44,154 --> 00:52:45,553
Let me call you later.

720
00:52:45,554 --> 00:52:46,623
Wait.

721
00:52:47,293 --> 00:52:49,594
Just tell me where you are. Please.

722
00:52:50,393 --> 00:52:52,034
I'm near Jangmi Elementary School.

723
00:52:57,933 --> 00:53:00,404
There. Where does that path lead to?

724
00:53:02,503 --> 00:53:04,413
I think she's going to the playground.

725
00:53:04,813 --> 00:53:06,373
Show me the security camera at the playground. Hurry.

726
00:53:13,313 --> 00:53:15,983
There she is. Where does that path lead to?

727
00:53:18,893 --> 00:53:20,962
That leads to private academies in the commercial building.

728
00:53:20,963 --> 00:53:22,063
Thank you.

729
00:53:23,924 --> 00:53:26,494
Jae Yi!

730
00:53:27,634 --> 00:53:28,704
Jae Yi!

731
00:53:58,864 --> 00:54:01,063
I'm sorry that I plucked you.

732
00:54:01,333 --> 00:54:05,433
But my mom likes flowers.

733
00:54:09,003 --> 00:54:10,204
Jae Yi.

734
00:54:11,413 --> 00:54:12,713
Ma'am.

735
00:54:17,244 --> 00:54:20,413
Jae Yi. Did you cross the street by yourself to get here?

736
00:54:20,784 --> 00:54:24,054
It's dangerous. Did you come here all by yourself?

737
00:54:28,994 --> 00:54:29,994
It's all right.

738
00:54:32,264 --> 00:54:36,563
My mom hates me, so she's going to the US by herself.

739
00:54:36,933 --> 00:54:39,674
But I want to live with her.

740
00:54:40,134 --> 00:54:42,944
And my mom likes flowers.

741
00:54:47,944 --> 00:54:49,043
I see.

742
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,454
Jae Yi, you're such a kind girl.

743
00:54:54,014 --> 00:54:55,683
You're so kind.

744
00:55:10,503 --> 00:55:13,233
I found her. She's at the elementary school.

745
00:55:15,304 --> 00:55:18,244
Thank you. I'll head over there now.

746
00:55:18,844 --> 00:55:22,143
Delay going back to the US. We should talk.

747
00:55:30,023 --> 00:55:32,994
Jae Yi. You know what?

748
00:55:33,853 --> 00:55:37,494
I'm going to help you, so you won't feel sad.

749
00:55:38,764 --> 00:55:42,034
I want to live with my mom.

750
00:55:42,733 --> 00:55:44,574
I like my dad too,

751
00:55:45,074 --> 00:55:46,733
but I like my mom more.

752
00:55:51,143 --> 00:55:55,712
Right. I'll think about that more...

753
00:55:55,713 --> 00:55:57,114
and talk to your mom.

754
00:55:58,183 --> 00:56:00,753
I'll try to think about it a lot more from your side.

755
00:56:02,123 --> 00:56:03,753
- Ma'am. - Yes?

756
00:56:04,023 --> 00:56:05,293
This is for you.

757
00:56:14,333 --> 00:56:15,404
Thank you.

758
00:56:17,404 --> 00:56:19,502
- Jae Yi! - Jae Yi!

759
00:56:19,503 --> 00:56:21,503
Mom. Dad.

760
00:56:22,344 --> 00:56:23,804
- Choi Jae Yi. - Jae Yi!

761
00:56:28,813 --> 00:56:30,344
Jae Yi, wait up.

762
00:56:32,483 --> 00:56:33,554
Jae Yi!

763
00:56:37,123 --> 00:56:38,154
I'm sorry.

764
00:56:39,154 --> 00:56:40,224
Jae Yi.

765
00:56:41,293 --> 00:56:42,824
- No! - Jae Yi!

766
00:56:43,123 --> 00:56:44,224
No!

767
00:57:02,884 --> 00:57:04,014
Jae Yi!

768
00:57:07,154 --> 00:57:08,154
Jae Yi.

769
00:57:15,023 --> 00:57:16,224
Jae Yi.

770
00:57:16,523 --> 00:57:17,732
Please hurry.

771
00:57:17,733 --> 00:57:19,463
We're in front of Jangmi Elementary School. Hurry!

772
00:57:20,694 --> 00:57:22,363
- My daughter was hit by a bus. - Jae Yi.

773
00:57:22,364 --> 00:57:23,663
Jae Yi is hurt!

774
00:57:33,014 --> 00:57:34,074
Professor Oh.

775
00:57:40,784 --> 00:57:42,154
Jae Yi.

(Central Operating Room)

778
00:58:15,884 --> 00:58:16,924
What happened?

779
00:58:17,654 --> 00:58:19,622
I'm sorry. I did my best.

780
00:58:19,623 --> 00:58:20,753
No.

781
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:22,724
I'm sorry.

782
00:58:30,733 --> 00:58:31,873
I'm sorry.

(Central Operating Room)

784
00:58:44,114 --> 00:58:46,352
- You can't go inside. - You can't come in here.

785
00:58:46,353 --> 00:58:47,983
You can't come in here.

786
00:58:53,424 --> 00:58:58,233
(Central Operating Room)

787
01:00:15,043 --> 01:00:17,204
Your son asked me for a favour.

788
01:00:17,344 --> 01:00:21,313
So I told everyone not to go inside the OR.

789
01:00:22,344 --> 01:00:24,043
Sorry about this, Director Cha.

790
01:00:26,284 --> 01:00:27,384
Give...

791
01:00:29,853 --> 01:00:32,793
Give them some space, please.

792
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:38,364
(Director Cha of Seojung University Hospital)

793
01:01:07,393 --> 01:01:09,663
No. Jae Yi.

794
01:01:12,233 --> 01:01:16,904
No...

795
01:01:18,833 --> 01:01:21,344
No.

796
01:01:23,043 --> 01:01:25,244
No, Jae Yi.

797
01:01:29,284 --> 01:01:30,614
Sleep well,

798
01:01:33,284 --> 01:01:35,683
my baby, Jae Yi.

799
01:01:39,523 --> 01:01:42,563
(Why Her?)

800
01:02:02,813 --> 01:02:04,443
You killed her, Jae Yi.

801
01:02:04,444 --> 01:02:06,654
You killed your own daughter.

802
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:10,482
The ink hasn't even dried yet.

803
01:02:10,483 --> 01:02:12,154
But I'll respect it. You do the same.

804
01:02:12,224 --> 01:02:15,163
So what if my daughter got a bonus? Did I get the bonus?

805
01:02:16,224 --> 01:02:18,463
My granddaughter passed away.

806
01:02:18,694 --> 01:02:22,932
Will I be able to let go of all of my past?

807
01:02:22,933 --> 01:02:24,003
Did she contact you?

808
01:02:24,304 --> 01:02:26,133
Gosh. Where did she go?

809
01:02:26,134 --> 01:02:29,142
The bar association will hold a disciplinary hearing.

810
01:02:29,143 --> 01:02:30,602
What will the disciplinary action be?

811
01:02:30,603 --> 01:02:32,943
She'll be disbarred permanently.

812
01:02:32,944 --> 01:02:35,542
Is it true you've been buying off witnesses for your cases?

813
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:38,513
Explain the suspicion of the 200,000-dollar bribe.

814
01:02:38,514 --> 01:02:41,113
- Nominee Baek... - Chairman Choi.

Subject of the disciplinary hearing. Disclose your personal information.

My name is Oh Soo Jae.

I'm a member of the Seoul Central Bar Association.

818
01:02:46,494 --> 01:02:49,094
I'm working as a partner lawyer at TK Law Firm...

819
