What's this?

00:00:25,638 --> 00:00:28,807
I'm telling you the true nature of Ms. Park's death.

6
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:33,377
The nature is that you cornered Park So Young too aggressively,

7
00:00:33,947 --> 00:00:36,147
so you did something you shouldn't have as a lawyer.

Do you have proof that I am the father of the baby?

I thought you were better than this. You're being ridiculous.

Ms. Park So Young was pregnant with Chairman Choi's child.

I need you to do a good job of making a scandal with An Kang Won.

Then find a different job and live a quiet life.

39

However, Chairman Choi Tae Guk ordered her...

40
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:35,896
to make a scandal with Assemblyman An Kang Won...

41
00:02:35,897 --> 00:02:38,668
in order to get rid of Assemblyman Lee In Soo's biggest competitor.

42

You'd better keep your promise.

43
00:02:40,738 --> 00:02:43,707
If not, I'll tell everyone that I'm pregnant with your child...

44

Your deduced speculation cannot be considered evidence.

60

The police investigation concluded...

61
00:03:34,328 --> 00:03:36,127
that Ms. Park was murdered by Hong Seok Pal,

62
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,627
and the guilt drove him to commit suicide.

63
00:03:39,228 --> 00:03:41,067
Han Gi Taek, who assisted him with his suicide,

64
00:03:41,268 --> 00:03:43,138
confessed to everything and is behind bars now.

65
00:03:45,138 --> 00:03:48,936

murdered Park So Young.

00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:00,528
What?

166
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:02,798
You?

167
00:12:04,737 --> 00:12:05,837
Why did you do that?

168
00:12:06,337 --> 00:12:07,638
I'm sorry, Father.

169
00:12:09,477 --> 00:12:10,508
Please.

170
00:12:12,207 --> 00:12:13,807
Please stop here.

171
00:12:14,148 --> 00:12:15,148
You.

172
00:12:18,388 --> 00:12:19,987
Do you know what I had to do to come this far?

173
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:23,258
You're my son.

174
00:12:24,857 --> 00:12:26,887
- How dare you! - Father!

175
00:12:26,888 --> 00:12:29,258
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

176
00:12:30,557 --> 00:12:32,467
I have always given my all,

177
00:12:34,227 --> 00:12:36,067
and I have always done my very best.

178
00:12:36,898 --> 00:12:38,038
Father.

179
00:12:41,607 --> 00:12:43,378
Please pay for what you did.

180
00:12:47,148 --> 00:12:48,347
Get out!

181
00:12:51,178 --> 00:12:52,447
I do not want to see you...

182
00:12:53,618 --> 00:12:55,087
ever again.

183
00:12:57,487 --> 00:12:58,788
Get out at once.

184
00:13:19,977 --> 00:13:21,107
Mr. Seo.

185
00:13:21,378 --> 00:13:23,118
When Ms. Oh was a public defender ten years ago,

186
00:13:23,217 --> 00:13:26,087
she used a case to her own benefit.

187
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:28,316
Director Baek Jin Ki proposed to her...

188
00:13:28,317 --> 00:13:30,686
that he'd help her join TK Law Firm if she gave up...

189
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:32,986
proactively defending Kim Dong Gu in his trial.

190
00:13:32,987 --> 00:13:34,727
She accepted the proposition,

191
00:13:35,097 --> 00:13:36,697
and that's how she joined TK Law Firm.

192
00:13:37,227 --> 00:13:39,697
She dared to strike a deal using the trial.

193
00:13:40,498 --> 00:13:41,966
If this is true,

194
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:44,167
it means she violated Article 24.2 of the Attorneys-at-Law Act,

195
00:13:44,168 --> 00:13:45,606
which states that attorneys mustn't conceal the truth...

196
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:46,607
or make false statements.

197
00:13:46,737 --> 00:13:50,137
This proves that Ms. Oh deserves severe disciplinary action,

198
00:13:50,138 --> 00:13:52,946
regardless of who was responsible for Ms. Park So Young's death.

199
00:13:52,947 --> 00:13:54,107
Don't you agree?

200
00:13:54,378 --> 00:13:55,647
Yes, that's right.

201
00:13:55,648 --> 00:13:58,618
However, wasn't such a decision made because Chairman Choi approved it?

202
00:13:58,947 --> 00:14:02,787
That means Chairman Choi was involved in it too.

203
00:14:02,788 --> 00:14:05,527
No, my father knew nothing about it.

204
00:14:05,528 --> 00:14:08,157
It was strictly between Ms. Oh and Director Baek Jin Ki.

205
00:14:08,158 --> 00:14:10,857
Director Baek made such a proposition...

206
00:14:10,928 --> 00:14:14,227
using my father's name, for his own selfish reasons.

207
00:14:14,798 --> 00:14:17,268
Ms. Oh, do you admit this?

208
00:14:19,368 --> 00:14:21,067
(Accused Oh Soo Jae)

209
00:14:22,077 --> 00:14:23,207
Yes, I do.

210
00:14:28,518 --> 00:14:29,648
Mr. Seo.

211
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:33,018
I would like to request Kim Dong Gu,

212
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:35,518
the defendant in the trial, as a witness.

213
00:14:37,658 --> 00:14:39,627
If that incident from ten years ago is brought up,

214
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,687
Gong Chan will step in and testify as Kim Dong Gu.

215
00:14:41,827 --> 00:14:43,056
Keep that in mind.

216
00:14:43,057 --> 00:14:44,398
What? Gong Chan?

217
00:14:45,057 --> 00:14:46,597
Gong Chan is Kim Dong Gu?

218
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,398
You didn't know?

219
00:14:49,268 --> 00:14:51,466
That arrogant brat was Kim Dong Gu?

220
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:53,737
Do your research, will you?

221
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,778
If that case is brought up along with No Byung Chul's case,

222
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,747
you'll have to take the heat...

223
00:14:58,748 --> 00:15:00,248
as you put No Byung Chul behind bars.

224
00:15:00,548 --> 00:15:02,117
Do you want everyone to see...

225
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:03,778
the board chair breaking out in a cold sweat?

226
00:15:07,548 --> 00:15:10,317
Kim Dong Gu? He is here now?

227
00:15:11,518 --> 00:15:14,557
If Kim Dong Gu is here, let's bring him out.

228
00:15:14,727 --> 00:15:16,258
We should hear what he has to say.

229
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,237
Kim Dong Gu.

230
00:15:24,038 --> 00:15:25,508
Please proceed to the witness stand.

231
00:15:30,437 --> 00:15:31,508
(Board Member Hong Ki Pyo, Shim Min Joo)

232
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:37,918
(Witness)

233
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:42,057
I am Kim Dong Gu.

234
00:15:42,557 --> 00:15:43,857
Ten years ago,

235
00:15:44,557 --> 00:15:46,357
the police and prosecution coerced me into...

236
00:15:47,187 --> 00:15:49,097
making a false confession.

237
00:15:49,857 --> 00:15:53,668
No one listened to me or was willing to believe me.

238
00:15:54,597 --> 00:15:55,768
Everyone...

239
00:15:56,768 --> 00:16:00,437
harassed me until I said I did it.

240
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:04,777
That experience taught me that having no one...

241
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:07,077
who is even willing to listen to you or believe you...

242
00:16:07,847 --> 00:16:09,077
is pure misery.

243
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:10,717
But then,

244
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:13,847
I met someone who believed me.

245
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:16,057
It was none other...

246
00:16:18,158 --> 00:16:19,758
than Ms. Oh Soo Jae, the accused.

247
00:16:21,487 --> 00:16:25,227
After I met Ms. Oh, who was my public defender at the time,

248
00:16:25,368 --> 00:16:27,128
I was finally able to plead not guilty,

249
00:16:27,398 --> 00:16:29,797
but it was difficult to prove that the false confession...

250
00:16:29,798 --> 00:16:32,368
was coerced by the police and prosecution.

251
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:35,067
Back then, there were no cameras in the interview rooms.

252
00:16:35,237 --> 00:16:36,778
And any abusive or cruel acts against me...

253
00:16:37,678 --> 00:16:39,148
were done in secret.

254
00:16:39,807 --> 00:16:41,407
However, we managed to confirm...

255
00:16:41,408 --> 00:16:44,477
that such harassment actually occurred during the investigation.

256
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:48,317
I was the youngest detective on the team at the time.

257
00:16:51,857 --> 00:16:53,128
(Board Member Kang Gil Ju)

258
00:16:53,788 --> 00:16:57,597
Mr. Kang Gil Ju, who was the department chief at the time,

259
00:16:58,097 --> 00:17:00,028
said Kim Dong Gu had to be the culprit no matter what...

260
00:17:00,898 --> 00:17:03,498
and told us to squeeze a confession out of him at all costs.

261
00:17:03,737 --> 00:17:06,936
Mr. Kang was very close to the prosecution.

262
00:17:06,937 --> 00:17:10,408
Mr. Seo Jun Myeong was the prosecutor in charge of the case.

263
00:17:15,547 --> 00:17:17,318
That crazy little...

264
00:17:18,277 --> 00:17:20,417
Kim Dong Gu was accepted as the culprit...

265
00:17:20,418 --> 00:17:23,358
because his DNA and fingerprints were found on the knife.

266
00:17:23,858 --> 00:17:25,887
His confession backed up by the evidence,

267
00:17:25,888 --> 00:17:28,897
which was his fingerprint, was enough to prove him guilty!

268
00:17:28,898 --> 00:17:30,257
However, the confession...

269
00:17:30,658 --> 00:17:33,196
was obtained by coercion and force.

270
00:17:33,197 --> 00:17:35,127
Article 309 of the Criminal Procedure Act...

271
00:17:35,128 --> 00:17:36,536
deems such evidence inadmissible.

272
00:17:36,537 --> 00:17:38,436
And two unidentified fingerprints...

273
00:17:38,437 --> 00:17:40,668
were found on the knife in addition to Kim Dong Gu's print.

274
00:17:40,908 --> 00:17:43,678
Kim Dong Gu's confession has been proven false,

275
00:17:43,908 --> 00:17:47,308
so it is important that we identify the two fingerprints.

276
00:17:47,408 --> 00:17:50,117
Then have you managed to identify the two fingerprints?

277
00:17:50,118 --> 00:17:51,277
Yes, we have.

278
00:17:55,457 --> 00:17:57,456
The first one belonged to Jeon Na Jung, who is now deceased.

279
00:17:57,457 --> 00:17:58,687
And the second one...

280
00:17:59,858 --> 00:18:01,928
was Chairman Choi Tae Guk's.

281

(Disciplinary Board of Korean Bar Association)

283
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:13,367
This tells us that Jeon Na Jung...

284
00:18:13,368 --> 00:18:16,737
probably tried to block the knife with her bare hands.

285
00:18:17,237 --> 00:18:18,976
It also tells us that Chairman Choi Tae Guk...

286
00:18:18,977 --> 00:18:22,148
used the knife to kill Jeon Na Jung who was alive.

287

No!

288

Choi Ju Wan, Han Dong O, and Lee Si Hyuk.

293
00:18:36,328 --> 00:18:39,327
All this time, they probably believed that they had killed her,

303
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,777
just say...

304
00:19:26,247 --> 00:19:27,408
that you don't know.

he made Choi Ju Wan, Han Dong O, and Lee Si Hyuk leave.

312
00:19:53,037 --> 00:19:55,908
Then he saw that Jeon Na Jung wasn't dead,

313
00:19:57,108 --> 00:19:58,848
so he killed her.

(Board Member Hong Ki Pyo, Shim Min Joo)

331
00:21:20,058 --> 00:21:22,898
Mr. Ha, please come to the witness stand again.

332
00:21:38,437 --> 00:21:41,007
(Witness)

333
00:21:41,178 --> 00:21:44,247
Explain the nature of your relationship with him.

334
00:21:44,618 --> 00:21:46,487
And how did you end up filming this?

335
00:21:47,247 --> 00:21:48,888
Even before the incident took place,

336
00:21:49,957 --> 00:21:51,858
ever since my time in the gang,

337
00:21:51,987 --> 00:21:55,558
I had gathered the information he needed and ran errands for him.

338
00:21:56,128 --> 00:22:00,128
He told me to come to Chairman Han's house that night.

339
00:22:00,398 --> 00:22:02,838
I could sense that something bad had happened.

340
00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:04,598
I was worried...

341
00:22:05,838 --> 00:22:09,207
that perhaps, I might end up taking the fall for everything.

342
00:22:10,108 --> 00:22:11,178
So I filmed it.

343
00:22:12,878 --> 00:22:14,378
Then what did you do?

344
00:22:14,977 --> 00:22:17,118
The chairman killed Jeon Na Jung.

345
00:22:17,247 --> 00:22:19,787
And she was bound with pressure-sensitive tapes.

346
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:23,587
After untying the pressure-sensitive tapes,

347
00:22:23,588 --> 00:22:24,787
when I was trying...

348
00:22:25,257 --> 00:22:27,158
to abandon the body at the construction site,

349
00:22:27,658 --> 00:22:29,256
- Over here! - Kim Dong Gu came to the site...

350
00:22:29,257 --> 00:22:31,358
- and discovered the body. - Na Jung!

351
00:22:31,457 --> 00:22:32,568
Here...

352
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:36,197
So I framed Kim Dong Gu...

353
00:22:37,967 --> 00:22:39,737
for the murder.

354
00:22:50,848 --> 00:22:52,118
I would like to take this opportunity...

355
00:22:53,787 --> 00:22:55,217
to apologize...

356
00:22:57,187 --> 00:23:00,027
to Mr. Kim Dong Gu with all my heart.

357
00:23:11,037 --> 00:23:12,338
I'm sorry.

358
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:40,227
(Chairman Choi Tae Guk)

359
00:23:44,598 --> 00:23:47,108
This is the place you and the three of them...

360
00:23:47,507 --> 00:23:49,608
ruined my daughter, Jeon Na Jung, and Kim Dong Gu.

361
00:23:49,937 --> 00:23:52,707
How foolish of you that you failed to recognize a photo in your office.

362
00:23:53,108 --> 00:23:55,477
You will pay for your shameless actions.

363
00:24:33,687 --> 00:24:34,787
I'm sure you all heard...

364
00:24:35,618 --> 00:24:38,058
the name, Kang Eun Seo, at Nominee Baek Jin Ki's hearing...

365
00:24:38,318 --> 00:24:40,358
for the Minister of Justice yesterday.

366
00:24:42,457 --> 00:24:43,928
The night Jeon Na Jung died,

367
00:24:44,497 --> 00:24:46,167
the three of them kidnapped Jeon Na Jung...

368
00:24:46,168 --> 00:24:48,797
and dragged her to Chairman Han Sung Bum's house.

369
00:24:50,037 --> 00:24:51,437
And Kang Eun Seo was there too.

370
00:25:16,358 --> 00:25:18,757
Kang Eun Seo was dragged to Chairman Han Sung Bum's house.

371
00:25:19,797 --> 00:25:21,368
When she was escaping from the house,

372
00:25:21,898 --> 00:25:23,638
her earring accidentally came off in the house.

373
00:25:24,037 --> 00:25:26,137
The earring you're looking at is Kang Eun Seo's earring...

374
00:25:26,138 --> 00:25:28,037
which I found at Chairman Han's house...

375
00:25:28,437 --> 00:25:29,878
which I bought recently.

376
00:25:31,378 --> 00:25:33,046
When she was running away,

377
00:25:33,047 --> 00:25:34,206
she met a part-timer at a convenience store,

378
00:25:34,207 --> 00:25:35,378
Jeon Na Jung.

379
00:25:35,608 --> 00:25:38,918
Jeon Na Jung gave her store uniform to Kang Eun Seo.

380
00:25:40,787 --> 00:25:43,457
And this is Jeon Na Jung's uniform,

381
00:25:43,818 --> 00:25:45,257
which Ms. Oh Soo Jae's team found.

382
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:47,857
This analysis report confirms...

383
00:25:47,858 --> 00:25:50,297
the blood found on the uniform belongs to Kang Eun Seo.

384
00:25:52,527 --> 00:25:54,368
Kang Eun Seo is Nominee Baek Jin Ki's daughter...

385
00:25:54,797 --> 00:25:56,598
and was once engaged to me.

386
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:03,737
These individuals abducted her and violated her.

387
00:26:05,078 --> 00:26:06,678
And they also abducted Jeon Na Jung.

388
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:09,648
These individuals are Choi Ju Wan, Han Dong O, and Lee Si Hyuk.

389
00:26:09,878 --> 00:26:12,317
And to cover up their crime, their fathers joined hands.

390
00:26:12,318 --> 00:26:14,516
Lee In Soo, Han Sung Bum, and Choi Tae Guk.

391
00:26:14,517 --> 00:26:16,957
Moreover, police officers,

392
00:26:17,088 --> 00:26:20,257
prosecutors, judges, and reporters protected them.

393
00:26:21,358 --> 00:26:24,058
I hope they all face the punishment they deserve.

394
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:27,168
And I would like to sincerely thank Ms. Oh Soo Jae...

395
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:30,867
for stepping up to reveal the truth which couldn't have been easy.

(Park So Young, Hong Seok Pal, Jeon Na Jung, No Byung Chul)

400
00:26:53,527 --> 00:26:55,927
An investigative agency violated the suspect's rights...

401
00:26:55,928 --> 00:26:57,398
and coerced him to make a false confession.

402
00:26:57,628 --> 00:27:00,797
And when his defence counsel tried to correct the false confession,

403
00:27:01,168 --> 00:27:03,598
the court didn't accept it as it wasn't credible.

404
00:27:04,237 --> 00:27:06,266
Police officers, prosecutors, and judges...

405
00:27:06,267 --> 00:27:08,338
treated the trial as if it was a part of a play.

406
00:27:08,568 --> 00:27:11,276
They repeatedly covered up the organized crimes...

407
00:27:11,277 --> 00:27:13,878
of the individuals who mocked justice.

408

And the reporters...

409
00:27:16,247 --> 00:27:19,287
were utilized to provide a strong foundation for their agendas.

Surrounded by these individuals,

411
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:25,217
I failed to see the shame in my action.

412
00:27:25,787 --> 00:27:27,727
I am disclosing my mistakes at the hearing,

413
00:27:28,227 --> 00:27:31,697
so regardless of the result of his hearing, I will accept...

are connected to the cases that are mentioned today,

419

the disciplinary board...

420
00:27:51,777 --> 00:27:54,787
doesn't deserve to enforce disciplinary action on the subject.

Accused Oh. No.

422

Ms. Oh exposed the truth about many criminal incidents.

00:28:00,727 --> 00:28:03,128
And I urge the investigative agency to thoroughly follow up on them.

And as a member of this board,

I would like to reveal that...

426
00:28:08,497 --> 00:28:10,537
there has been foul play from the get-go.

This board was called...

428
00:28:13,007 --> 00:28:16,007
because Chairman Choi Tae Guk used his influence over the legal circle.

429

I would like to praise Ms. Oh and her legal team...

Hansu Bio...

446
00:30:22,497 --> 00:30:24,667
deceived us into thinking that the phase-three clinical trial...

00:30:24,668 --> 00:30:26,207
had been approved.

448

We've also confirmed...

a number of serious deal-breaker issues such as...

accounting fraud, money laundering using dummy companies, and so on.

451

This is a clear violation of the terms and conditions...

No, right?

460
00:31:05,007 --> 00:31:07,878
Dong O, Si Hyuk, and I killed her.

461
00:31:08,578 --> 00:31:11,247
All you did was get Mr. Ha to clean up the mess.

462

That's what happened, right?

463

No, Father. That's...

How could you think it was a good thing for me?

467
00:31:39,108 --> 00:31:42,108
It tormented me, and I felt horrible for putting you through that.

468

That's why I did everything you told me to do.

469
00:31:45,648 --> 00:31:47,547
I broke up with Soo Jae when you told me to.

470
00:31:47,987 --> 00:31:50,487
You told me to make it look like Seung Yeon was Jae Yi's mother,

471
00:31:51,017 --> 00:31:52,457
so I did that too.

it was revealed that Mr. Lee and even his son were involved in it.

- What? - It's true?

479
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:34,526
Did you get rid of the body too?

Yes, sir.

joined hands with Chairman Choi and Chairman Han...

486
00:32:54,388 --> 00:32:57,858
to cover up the crime committed by their sons,

487

Lee Si Hyuk, Choi Ju Wan, and Han Dong O.

488

489

of Park So Young and Hong Seok Pal.

490
00:33:07,168 --> 00:33:09,197
As of today, I am stepping down...

491
00:33:09,767 --> 00:33:11,597
as Assemblyman Lee's spokesperson.

492
00:33:11,598 --> 00:33:13,667
SP Partners stated that they alone hold the right...

493
00:33:13,668 --> 00:33:15,536
to nullify the contract...

494
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:18,207
and that the up-front payment and penalty must be returned.

495
00:33:18,277 --> 00:33:20,408
Does Hansu Group agree with that statement?

496
00:33:21,007 --> 00:33:24,017
I don't think we have a choice.

497
00:33:25,517 --> 00:33:28,686
TK's Chairman Choi Tae Guk and Assemblyman Lee In Soo...

498
00:33:28,687 --> 00:33:30,956
were deeply involved in Chairman Han Sung Bum's...

499
00:33:30,957 --> 00:33:32,257
money laundering activities.

The issues with Hansu Bio's phase-three clinical trial...

501
00:33:37,297 --> 00:33:40,227
and concealing clinical trial victims are all true.

502
00:33:40,898 --> 00:33:43,037
Chairman Han and Director Han Dong O were also deeply involved...

503
00:33:43,138 --> 00:33:46,197
in the crimes that Ms. Oh exposed during her hearing.

504
00:33:46,267 --> 00:33:49,308
I sincerely apologize as the company's Chief Legal Officer,

505
00:33:49,608 --> 00:33:52,678
and I'd like to let you know that I am stepping down as of today.

506
00:33:56,148 --> 00:33:59,216
Hey, Soo Jae. Thanks to you, I wrapped it up well.

507
00:33:59,217 --> 00:34:02,517
You, Hee Young, and I should go out for a drink together, Soo Jae.

509
00:34:07,858 --> 00:34:10,927
The sell-off deal involving Hansu Group, TK Law Firm,

510
00:34:10,928 --> 00:34:13,167
and SP Partners is the talk of the town.

511
00:34:13,228 --> 00:34:16,026
It is said that Hansu Group and TK Law Firm...

512
00:34:16,027 --> 00:34:18,236
owe SP Partners an astronomical amount of money...

513
00:34:18,237 --> 00:34:20,208
based on the terms of their agreement.

514
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:22,407
Rumour has it that some of Hansu's subsidiaries...

515
00:34:22,408 --> 00:34:25,038
and TK Law Firm may declare bankruptcy.

516

He is no longer a presidential candidate.

Assemblyman Lee, Chairman Han Sung Bum, Chairman Choi Tae Guk,

520
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:35,817
and even their sons are awaiting investigation.

521

The police will arrest you tomorrow morning.

except for you.

You sound drunk.

552
00:40:31,938 --> 00:40:33,507
You should stop drinking.

taken you in?

as my daughter-in-law?

No, sir.

You can't call that doing your best.

565
00:41:12,917 --> 00:41:14,887
What you did was evil.

566
00:41:14,888 --> 00:41:17,357
No. It wasn't evil.

567
00:41:19,388 --> 00:41:22,357
It was the best thing I could have done for my life.

be ashamed,

572
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,147
and be embarrassed by it.

573

That's...

574
00:41:45,147 --> 00:41:47,417

only one regret.

580

You're about to be investigated. How do you feel?

Is it true that you covered up Hansu Bio's clinical trials?

608

Where did the slush fund from Hansu Group go?

609

All right. I'm an honest man.

and pretending to be sick.

612
00:46:13,917 --> 00:46:15,888
I did some illegal things.

613

But the real bad guy is the late chairman, Choi Tae Guk.

614

I'm sure he's in a pit of fire now.

640
00:49:02,447 --> 00:49:06,458
In 2008, the bank president of Geummyeong Savings Bank,

641
00:49:06,587 --> 00:49:09,027
Geum Sae Yong asked him for a favourable ruling by the court.

642
00:49:09,527 --> 00:49:12,757
He pressured his junior who was the judge in charge of the case...

643
00:49:13,257 --> 00:49:15,267
and received 200,000 dollars from an illegal loan broker,

after a criminal incident.

650
00:49:32,147 --> 00:49:34,987
He played an important role in uncovering the truth.

651
00:49:35,417 --> 00:49:38,057
And he also donated all of his money to an association...

for the victims of Geummyeong Savings Bank.

653

He did his best to compensate the victims as best as he could.

I continued to live...

659
00:50:02,678 --> 00:50:04,377
my lonely, petty life.

660
00:50:05,248 --> 00:50:07,688
My life is filled with shame.

661
00:50:08,217 --> 00:50:10,417
But thanks to Ms. Oh,

662
00:50:11,658 --> 00:50:13,888
I was able to see justice in my daughter's case...

663
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:17,228
and remove the layers of evil from my life.

664
00:50:17,998 --> 00:50:21,127
More importantly, thanks to Ms. Oh,

665
00:50:22,167 --> 00:50:23,567
I am able to stand here...

666
00:50:24,797 --> 00:50:28,308
and face the punishment for my actions.

667
00:50:28,737 --> 00:50:29,938
Thank you.

668
00:50:34,408 --> 00:50:35,607
Your Honour.

669
00:50:36,348 --> 00:50:38,578
Please give me a heavy sentence.

670
00:50:39,447 --> 00:50:42,417
Anyone who commits a crime must face punishment.

671
00:50:42,788 --> 00:50:44,157
Please show the world that...

672
00:50:44,158 --> 00:50:47,158
especially officers of the court must be held...

673
00:50:48,728 --> 00:50:49,958
to a higher standard.

674
00:50:50,928 --> 00:50:53,998
(Six months later)

675
00:51:17,317 --> 00:51:18,987
It's been a while, Ms. Oh.

676
00:51:26,328 --> 00:51:28,498
Mr. Baek sends his regards.

677
00:51:29,268 --> 00:51:31,797
Is he doing well?

678
00:51:32,598 --> 00:51:33,598
Yes.

679
00:51:34,368 --> 00:51:36,337
He said he was actually relieved.

680
00:51:37,337 --> 00:51:41,147
I'm a bit worried that Eun Seo seems to notice his absence.

681
00:51:44,748 --> 00:51:46,578
I came to make an offer.

682
00:51:49,288 --> 00:51:53,357
I would like to invest in your firm, Central Law Office.

683
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:56,287
Why don't you expand it into a major law firm?

684
00:51:56,288 --> 00:51:58,127
And I'd love to have you as my company's legal advisor.

685
00:51:58,797 --> 00:52:00,867
Hansu Group is still giving me a headache...

686
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:02,567
about the cancellation of the contract.

687
00:52:05,237 --> 00:52:08,667
I'm grateful for your offer, but I'll decline.

688
00:52:09,337 --> 00:52:10,607
I like where I am now.

689
00:52:12,538 --> 00:52:15,208
I'm curious what your secret is.

690
00:52:17,277 --> 00:52:18,748
I mean, you seem genuinely happy.

691
00:52:21,348 --> 00:52:22,688
Well,

692
00:52:24,257 --> 00:52:26,158
every day of my life belongs to me.

693
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:30,797
I can follow my own will and make my own decisions.

694
00:52:32,098 --> 00:52:34,928
And the consequences are all mine to bear.

695
00:52:37,438 --> 00:52:39,967
That's a pretty grand thing.

696
00:52:42,467 --> 00:52:44,237
Regardless of how things turn out,

697
00:52:44,777 --> 00:52:47,236
when I'm happy, I bask in joy. When things don't work out...

698
00:52:47,237 --> 00:52:49,678
"So what?" And I look for another way.

699
00:52:50,717 --> 00:52:51,978
If it still doesn't... "Oh, well."

700
00:52:53,647 --> 00:52:54,917
Isn't it silly?

701
00:52:55,947 --> 00:52:57,288
But...

702
00:52:58,288 --> 00:53:02,158
I like the way I'm living my life now.

703
00:53:03,458 --> 00:53:04,598
I envy you.

704
00:53:12,498 --> 00:53:13,737
Congratulations.

705
00:53:23,047 --> 00:53:25,417
We're recruiting more students for the Legal Clinic Center.

706
00:53:25,678 --> 00:53:27,347
The Legal Clinic Center...

707
00:53:27,348 --> 00:53:29,687
plans to lodge a class action suit against the victims...

708
00:53:29,688 --> 00:53:32,857
of Hansu Bio's clinical trials and provide free legal counselling.

709
00:53:33,018 --> 00:53:34,928
We look forward to meeting our new students.

710
00:53:35,788 --> 00:53:37,498
(Advanced Fieldwork for Lawyers)

711
00:53:42,768 --> 00:53:43,928
She's late again.

712
00:53:45,538 --> 00:53:47,808
I knew it. She never changes.

713
00:53:48,737 --> 00:53:50,038
We have less than ten minutes left.

714
00:54:17,228 --> 00:54:19,998
(Never let my client end up in prison.)

715
00:54:22,237 --> 00:54:25,107
(Never let my client end up in prison.)

716
00:54:28,408 --> 00:54:30,046
That's the first and last thing...

717
00:54:30,047 --> 00:54:31,777
of your advanced fieldwork as lawyers.

718
00:54:36,888 --> 00:54:37,958
But...

719
00:54:39,558 --> 00:54:42,428
there are some things you must follow as lawyers.

720
00:54:43,357 --> 00:54:44,927
Just because you know a bit about the law,

721
00:54:44,928 --> 00:54:46,897
don't interpret it how you see it and abuse it.

722
00:54:47,357 --> 00:54:50,397
Don't abuse the law for certain benefits or individuals.

723
00:54:51,167 --> 00:54:54,268
The law must be fair and just for everyone.

724
00:54:55,138 --> 00:54:56,237
One more thing.

725
00:54:57,107 --> 00:54:59,007
The law is flawed.

726
00:54:59,478 --> 00:55:02,408
Finding the flaw and using it to the client's advantage...

727
00:55:02,647 --> 00:55:04,978
is one of the skills lawyers must have.

728
00:55:05,277 --> 00:55:07,046
I used those strategies...

729
00:55:07,047 --> 00:55:09,547
to become a so-called successful lawyer.

730
00:55:11,317 --> 00:55:14,458
But I stand here before you,

731
00:55:14,828 --> 00:55:16,458
not as a successful lawyer.

732
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:21,768
My successful career came with a lot of shame.

733
00:55:22,268 --> 00:55:24,538
I have a lot of regrets and shame.

734
00:55:25,768 --> 00:55:28,667
So I am trying not to be a so-called successful lawyer.

735
00:55:31,337 --> 00:55:32,978
I'm just a mere lawyer.

736
00:55:36,748 --> 00:55:38,647
I hope you will arduously think...

737
00:55:39,618 --> 00:55:42,288
about the direction that will bring you to success...

738
00:55:43,447 --> 00:55:45,857
instead of fixating on success itself.

739
00:55:47,518 --> 00:55:51,627
Lastly, in whatever circumstances, you must protect yourselves.

740
00:55:51,928 --> 00:55:53,697
Don't let people walk all over you.

741
00:55:54,428 --> 00:55:57,667
Become a grounded, strong lawyer.

742
00:56:01,438 --> 00:56:03,038
Just like last semester,

743
00:56:03,308 --> 00:56:04,776
there might be a lecture from time to time.

744
00:56:04,777 --> 00:56:06,308
What? Again?

745
00:56:06,978 --> 00:56:09,078
- No way. - It can't be.

746
00:56:10,277 --> 00:56:11,717
Your grades...

747
00:56:12,748 --> 00:56:14,486
will solely be based on your analysis of a ruling.

748
00:56:14,487 --> 00:56:15,688
That's the only assignment?

749
00:56:16,587 --> 00:56:19,017
- It's that again. - Come on.

750
00:56:19,018 --> 00:56:21,427
I promised a few things to the student who came in first...

751
00:56:21,428 --> 00:56:23,127
last semester.

752
00:56:23,627 --> 00:56:25,998
The 20,000 dollars to put toward tuition fees and some more.

753
00:56:26,297 --> 00:56:28,397
And an internship at TK Law Firm.

754
00:56:29,397 --> 00:56:33,037
I already kept my promise about the monetary aspect.

755
00:56:33,038 --> 00:56:36,207
- What? Who got the money? - Who was it?

756
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:38,538
I believe the student who got the money from me is here.

757
00:56:39,578 --> 00:56:41,248
- Who is it? Was it you? - Was it you?

758
00:56:58,697 --> 00:57:01,098
I will be interning at your law office,

759
00:57:01,228 --> 00:57:03,598
not at TK Law Firm, right?

760
00:57:03,928 --> 00:57:04,997
As long as you want to.

761
00:57:04,998 --> 00:57:07,808
Oh, please. I'll join you no matter what.

762
00:57:13,178 --> 00:57:16,007
If you don't like my method, you can drop the class now.

763
00:57:20,317 --> 00:57:22,248
- What is it? - Hold on.

764
00:57:28,458 --> 00:57:30,756
This is the guest lawyer of the Legal Clinic Center,

765
00:57:30,757 --> 00:57:31,797
Ms. Song Mi Rim.

766
00:57:32,857 --> 00:57:34,526
If you have any questions about the rulings,

767
00:57:34,527 --> 00:57:36,896
feel free to ask her any questions.

768
00:57:36,897 --> 00:57:38,638
I know these cases,

769
00:57:39,167 --> 00:57:41,208
so I welcome any questions any day.

770
00:57:42,538 --> 00:57:46,208
Right. The money is off the table for this semester.

771
00:57:46,277 --> 00:57:49,107
- What? Why not? - Why not?

772
00:57:49,848 --> 00:57:51,046
I'm broke.

773
00:57:51,047 --> 00:57:54,276
- Come on. - What about the money?

774
00:57:54,277 --> 00:57:57,248
All right. Everyone, come and get one.

775
00:58:22,408 --> 00:58:24,748
(The 20th Annual Hanmaeum Track and Field Day)

776
00:58:31,288 --> 00:58:34,688
Had I known, I would have brought a pretty umbrella.

777
00:58:34,757 --> 00:58:38,428
(The 20th Annual Hanmaeum Track and Field Day)

778
00:58:39,458 --> 00:58:40,458
Let's go.

779
00:59:11,897 --> 00:59:14,928
(Why Her?)

780
01:00:24,567 --> 01:00:32,537
(Why Her?)

781
01:00:32,538 --> 01:00:40,518
(Why Her?)
