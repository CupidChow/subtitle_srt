I have a lot on my mind now too. Let's talk about Jae Yi later.

How could you not have known?

7

How could you not have recognized your own daughter?

8
00:00:27,887 --> 00:00:30,188
I'll do a good job as the firm's managing partner...

9

Jae Yi is gone.

12
00:00:38,258 --> 00:00:41,967
I told her I was going to the US by myself.

13
00:00:41,968 --> 00:00:44,297
I told her that she would live with her dad now.

22
00:01:26,177 --> 00:01:27,778
I hoped that I'd never wake up...

23
00:01:28,877 --> 00:01:30,407
if it was a dream.

24
00:01:33,147 --> 00:01:34,847
There were...

25
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:39,688
so many things I wanted to do with you in that dream.

28
00:02:02,507 --> 00:02:04,448
If Soo Jae made sure she wouldn't cross the street...

29
00:02:04,847 --> 00:02:06,918
If she never acted up to begin with, Jae Yi would still be with us.

30

What? Calm down?

31

Even just a few hours ago, she was alive and healthy.

33
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,327
But she suddenly died.

34
00:02:18,998 --> 00:02:21,727
Right before my eyes. I can't believe this.

35

36

You told him the three of us were the main suspects in the case.

That's why he told you that Jae Yi was your daughter.

Because you guys are the prime suspects in the case.

00:13:52,258 --> 00:13:53,717
He's really something, isn't he?

170
00:13:54,487 --> 00:13:57,188
Then he should've at least paid her well.

171
00:13:57,758 --> 00:13:59,597
Gosh, I feel so bad for her.

172
00:13:59,857 --> 00:14:02,566
Then you must know...

173
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:05,237
who killed Park So Young and Hong Seok Pal.

174
00:14:05,668 --> 00:14:07,567
Even if I know who did it, I can't tell you.

175
00:14:08,337 --> 00:14:10,168
At the same time, I can't say I don't know.

176
00:14:11,707 --> 00:14:13,337
Ask Mr. Ha...

177
00:14:15,707 --> 00:14:16,947
Actually, no.

178
00:14:17,947 --> 00:14:19,677
Why don't you ask Chairman Choi Tae Guk?

179

(Han Gi Taek Recording)

180
00:14:20,817 --> 00:14:22,087

But I'll respect it. You do the same.

188
00:15:07,697 --> 00:15:08,768
Soo Jae.

189
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:15,538
I did some digging. There's a possibility that...

190
00:15:15,867 --> 00:15:18,308
Mr. Choi's deceased daughter was Ms. Oh's child.

191
00:15:23,008 --> 00:15:24,577
One more thing, Father.

192
00:15:25,077 --> 00:15:27,048
About the garbage bag from Chairman Han's house.

193
00:15:27,418 --> 00:15:29,388
They found Eun Seo's earring in it.

194
00:15:29,918 --> 00:15:33,357
It's the one I gave to her as a gift ten years ago.

195
00:15:38,428 --> 00:15:40,928
We found a faint bloodstain on the earring.

196
00:15:43,197 --> 00:15:46,567
Does the blood belong to Eun Seo?

197
00:15:46,668 --> 00:15:49,438
No, they're still analyzing it.

198
00:15:49,768 --> 00:15:53,477
It's from ten years ago, so it's not easy to extract DNA from it.

199
00:15:53,707 --> 00:15:55,178
It'll take some time.

200
00:15:56,548 --> 00:15:59,447
We lifted several fingerprints from the tape.

201
00:15:59,817 --> 00:16:02,017
It means a number of people used it to tie someone.

202
00:16:02,018 --> 00:16:04,888
The fingerprint analysis will take some time too.

203
00:16:05,888 --> 00:16:08,486
But why was it left in there?

204
00:16:08,487 --> 00:16:10,557
In the wall, in a garbage bag at that.

205
00:16:10,558 --> 00:16:12,797
I've heard of instances where construction workers...

206
00:16:12,798 --> 00:16:14,727
leave garbage in the walls.

207
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:16,827
Many years have passed,

208
00:16:16,928 --> 00:16:20,097
but the walls and the plastic bags helped preserve the evidence.

And TK Law Firm is me.

214
00:18:46,477 --> 00:18:48,947
I thought that if I persevered and kept on climbing,

215
00:18:50,618 --> 00:18:52,987
I'd eventually reach a world waiting up there just for me.

216
00:18:55,287 --> 00:18:57,388
Turns out, there was nothing.

217

What does it mean to breathe?

And to be alive.

The fact that I'm still alive and breathing like this...

225

is indescribably humiliating.

Next news is about Presidential Candidate Lee In Soo.

231
00:20:25,078 --> 00:20:27,446
Regarding his daughter's special bonus of four million dollars...

232
00:20:27,447 --> 00:20:30,087
and his mother-in-law's apartments bought at giveaway prices,

233
00:20:30,088 --> 00:20:33,157
there is a sudden rise of sympathy toward Lee,

234
00:20:33,158 --> 00:20:35,628
which has resulted in an upward trend in his ratings.

235
00:20:35,957 --> 00:20:39,296
Regarding the allegations, Lee stated earlier today...

236
00:20:39,297 --> 00:20:41,157
that there were no legal issues...

237
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:43,497
and apologized for the public outrage they caused.

238
00:20:43,727 --> 00:20:45,668
I assure you that there are no issues legally.

239

- Lee In Soo! - Withdraw from the election!

241
00:20:54,237 --> 00:20:56,306
Hansu Group's stock price had plummeted...

242
00:20:56,307 --> 00:20:58,476
due to the allegations surrounding Yeongpyeong District...

243
00:20:58,477 --> 00:21:00,577
and Director Han Dong O's hidden camera scandal,

244
00:21:00,578 --> 00:21:02,077
but Hansu managed to win back public trust...

245
00:21:02,078 --> 00:21:03,687
with its announcement to sell half-priced homes...

246
00:21:03,688 --> 00:21:04,917
to help low-income households.

247
00:21:04,918 --> 00:21:07,817
The company's stock rose 3.4 percent this week...

248
00:21:07,818 --> 00:21:09,828
- Thank you. - and is continuing to recover.

249
00:21:09,957 --> 00:21:13,857
Some expected that the sell-off of Hansu Bio would fall through,

250
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:17,067
but SP Partners released an official statement that the company...

251
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:18,767
never considered backing out of the deal.

252
00:21:19,168 --> 00:21:22,167
Many say that Chairman Han Sung Bum's honest leadership...

253
00:21:22,168 --> 00:21:25,407
helped the company quickly bounce back...

254
00:21:25,408 --> 00:21:26,877
even after such unsavory scandals...

255
00:21:26,878 --> 00:21:28,207
that could've been detrimental to the company.

256
00:21:28,878 --> 00:21:31,047
I checked the places you told me, but she wasn't there.

257
00:21:32,277 --> 00:21:35,717
Yes. If you hear from her, call me right away.

258
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,016
I was going to come and see you.

It's okay. I'm here. You have a lot going on right now.

Where did she go?

262
00:21:49,568 --> 00:21:50,997
She can be so mean.

263
00:21:51,928 --> 00:21:54,037
She has a knack for making everyone worry about her.

264
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:55,868
She knew we'd look for her, but she didn't care.

265
00:21:56,838 --> 00:21:58,068
I told her...

266
00:21:58,908 --> 00:22:00,878
to just forget about TK and everything else.

267
00:22:01,807 --> 00:22:03,878
I told her that she should just live a happy life with you.

268
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:11,747
I'm sorry. I'll call you later.

She's the woman your son and his friends met at the club...

270
00:22:23,128 --> 00:22:25,737
and took to Chairman Han's house the night Jeon Na Jung died.

271
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:28,908
A long-term care hospital...

272
00:22:29,007 --> 00:22:30,638
Her name is Kang Eun Seo.

273
00:22:30,938 --> 00:22:32,838
She was injured in a car accident ten years ago,

274
00:22:33,138 --> 00:22:35,078
so she has the mental capacity of a young child.

275
00:22:35,878 --> 00:22:37,946
She does not remember her past at all.

276
00:22:37,947 --> 00:22:39,077
What about her family?

277
00:22:39,078 --> 00:22:42,747
Her mother, Kang Myung Ju, was a single mom.

278
00:22:43,188 --> 00:22:45,246
Kang Eun Seo took her mother's surname.

279
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:48,618
And her mother died six years ago.

280
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:51,128
Who's taking care of the hospital bills?

281
00:22:51,388 --> 00:22:53,157
Before Kang Myung Ju died,

282
00:22:53,158 --> 00:22:55,527
she left her money with the hospital for her daughter.

283
00:22:55,797 --> 00:22:57,398
She has no other family.

284
00:22:57,898 --> 00:22:59,367
I don't think you need to be concerned, sir.

285
00:22:59,368 --> 00:23:02,037
Is she close to any staff or volunteers at the hospital?

286
00:23:03,608 --> 00:23:07,237
Did you get a list of people who visited her over the years?

287
00:23:08,307 --> 00:23:11,348
I'll look into that a bit more.

288
00:23:11,477 --> 00:23:13,417
Come on. This isn't like you.

289
00:23:13,418 --> 00:23:15,818
I'm sorry. My son's condition...

290
00:23:15,987 --> 00:23:18,317
has gotten worse lately, so I've been distracted.

291
00:23:18,318 --> 00:23:20,517
Come on. That's nothing new.

292
00:23:22,787 --> 00:23:24,158
You still have to work.

293
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,227
I'm sorry, sir.

294
00:23:39,507 --> 00:23:40,737
As expected,

295
00:23:41,608 --> 00:23:44,648
Han Gi Taek turned down my visit, so I met with his wife.

296
00:23:45,348 --> 00:23:47,417
I offered 200,000 dollars to the women who threatened...

297
00:23:47,418 --> 00:23:50,247
to sue Director Han Dong O for secretly filming them.

298
00:23:50,487 --> 00:23:51,716
So everything has been settled.

299
00:23:51,717 --> 00:23:52,818
Soo Jae.

300
00:23:53,858 --> 00:23:56,287
The bar association will hold a disciplinary hearing.

301
00:23:57,987 --> 00:24:00,128
- Pardon? - The person who will chair it...

302
00:24:02,997 --> 00:24:05,628
Wait. How...

303
00:24:06,098 --> 00:24:07,368
I'm sure they already have their own chairperson...

304
00:24:07,668 --> 00:24:10,108
and arranged a replacement if need be.

305
00:24:12,378 --> 00:24:14,138
I trust you guys.

306
00:24:15,138 --> 00:24:17,847
Nam Gun Joong, the president of Seoul Central Bar Association...

307
00:24:17,848 --> 00:24:20,848
will inform Bar Association about Soo Jae's violation.

308
00:24:21,118 --> 00:24:22,917
Yu Dong Chu, the president of Bar Association...

309
00:24:22,918 --> 00:24:24,717
will put together a disciplinary board.

310
00:24:24,947 --> 00:24:26,888
Kim Ji Wook, the deputy manager of Court Administration.

311
00:24:27,158 --> 00:24:29,657
Oh Hyung Seok, the acting Minister of Justice.

312
00:24:29,658 --> 00:24:31,256
There will be nine people on the board.

313
00:24:31,257 --> 00:24:34,898
Hwang Gyung Hoo, Kang Gil Joo, Hong Gi Pyo, and you.

314
00:24:35,257 --> 00:24:36,328
The four of you will be on the board.

315
00:24:37,168 --> 00:24:40,168
For the voting, 5 of the 9 people...

316
00:24:40,537 --> 00:24:42,068
must side with us.

317
00:24:42,807 --> 00:24:44,938
You need to bring in at least one of them.

318
00:24:45,668 --> 00:24:47,236
Your ex-wife is on the board too.

319
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:49,078
Yes. But...

320
00:24:50,007 --> 00:24:51,206
she's...

321
00:24:51,207 --> 00:24:53,477
I don't care who it is. Bring someone over to our side.

322
00:24:53,878 --> 00:24:54,918
Yes, sir.

323
00:24:55,578 --> 00:25:00,318
But what's the degree of suspension for Soo Jae?

324
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,257
Revocation of her license.

325
00:25:03,088 --> 00:25:04,257
Permanent disbarment.

326
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:48,237
One of Mr. Ha's habits is...

327
00:25:49,807 --> 00:25:52,007
that he looks back after he leaves.

328
00:25:53,707 --> 00:25:55,608
And one of his other habits is...

329
00:25:56,078 --> 00:25:59,547
that once he gets something, he looks into it thoroughly.

330
00:26:07,618 --> 00:26:09,227
Because once you look into something,

331
00:26:10,088 --> 00:26:12,457
you're bound to find something.

332
00:26:15,257 --> 00:26:18,697
Like the nonsense Soo Jae is up to...

333
00:26:19,868 --> 00:26:21,938
with her sidekicks.

334
00:26:23,037 --> 00:26:24,368
How dare you come after my son...

335
00:26:24,638 --> 00:26:26,438
and the sons of Chairman Han and Lee In Soo?

336
00:26:28,638 --> 00:26:32,447
Should I call this cute or immature?

337
00:26:35,318 --> 00:26:36,787
We're looking for the truth.

338
00:26:37,818 --> 00:26:39,658
Don't mock us for that.

339
00:26:41,088 --> 00:26:42,658
Kim Dong Gu was framed as the culprit...

340
00:26:43,257 --> 00:26:45,388
of the incident from ten years ago.

341
00:26:45,787 --> 00:26:47,557
And No Byung Chul wasn't the real culprit.

342
00:26:48,658 --> 00:26:50,398
I'm sure you know that better than anyone.

343
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:52,837
When the three of them weren't the culprits,

344
00:26:52,838 --> 00:26:54,537
you're looking into Mr. Ha now?

345
00:26:55,797 --> 00:26:57,938
When the real culprit, No Byung Chul, is dead?

346
00:27:02,178 --> 00:27:04,108
If you need my fingerprints, feel free to take them.

347
00:27:07,118 --> 00:27:08,947
The culprit confessed.

348
00:27:09,547 --> 00:27:12,046
And his fingerprint was found on the murder weapon.

349
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,717
Other fingerprints on the weapon don't matter.

350
00:27:15,287 --> 00:27:17,358
I thought you knew that much.

351
00:27:17,457 --> 00:27:18,557
I do.

352
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:22,668
I also know that powerful people...

353
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:25,867
frame innocent people,

354
00:27:25,868 --> 00:27:27,767
deceive them, ruin their lives,

355
00:27:28,697 --> 00:27:30,507
so I should find the truth...

356
00:27:31,207 --> 00:27:32,977
and stand in their way.

357
00:27:33,938 --> 00:27:35,037
I know that too.

358
00:27:36,678 --> 00:27:38,078
And I will make sure to do so.

359
00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:41,547
No wonder why they call you Little Soo Jae.

360
00:27:44,348 --> 00:27:47,457
They were right. You're bold and interesting,

361
00:27:47,688 --> 00:27:49,557
just like Soo Jae.

362
00:27:51,457 --> 00:27:52,526
Now, she crossed the line...

363
00:27:52,527 --> 00:27:54,457
and is about to get kicked out like some dog.

364
00:27:56,027 --> 00:27:57,467
Relay this message to Soo Jae.

365
00:27:57,898 --> 00:28:00,467
The Bar Association will hold a disciplinary hearing.

366
00:28:02,338 --> 00:28:04,167
The only fitting solution for a crazy dog is...

367
00:28:04,168 --> 00:28:06,777
to break its legs and toss it out.

368
00:28:16,717 --> 00:28:18,388
Thank you for your fingerprints.

369
00:28:19,787 --> 00:28:20,787
Get out.

370
00:29:04,697 --> 00:29:05,967
Later on...

371
00:29:07,398 --> 00:29:08,668
Maybe...

372
00:29:09,368 --> 00:29:10,938
I should move to a place like this many years later.

373
00:29:15,707 --> 00:29:17,678
I hope Chan finds Soo Jae.

374
00:29:17,807 --> 00:29:18,947
He will.

375
00:29:19,517 --> 00:29:20,976
Even if he has to search the entire globe,

376
00:29:20,977 --> 00:29:23,246
he'll find her and come back with the professor.

377
00:29:23,247 --> 00:29:26,888
I'm sure Chan will find the professor. What about us?

378
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:31,888
Dr. Chae, you're sure there's a clue here, right?

379
00:29:32,027 --> 00:29:34,357
I'm sorry. My memory is so bad.

380
00:29:34,358 --> 00:29:35,956
So I never throw things out. I just hoard them.

381
00:29:35,957 --> 00:29:38,098
I think we might find some clues here. I'm sorry.

382
00:29:39,668 --> 00:29:41,597
I just hope we find them.

383
00:29:41,598 --> 00:29:43,437
It's all good as long as we find them.

384
00:29:43,438 --> 00:29:45,736
Chun Poong, help me with this.

385
00:29:45,737 --> 00:29:47,277
- Sure. - Gosh.

386
00:29:48,277 --> 00:29:49,477
- Wait. - Gosh.

387
00:29:49,707 --> 00:29:51,147
- Are you okay? - Are you okay?

388
00:29:51,148 --> 00:29:52,917
- Oh, no. - Gosh.

389
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:55,418
I didn't clean anything up here. I'm sorry.

390
00:29:59,017 --> 00:30:01,717
(Jeon Na Jung)

391
00:30:03,858 --> 00:30:06,857
- Here you go. - Good work.

392
00:30:06,858 --> 00:30:08,297
No problem.

393
00:30:09,997 --> 00:30:12,767
Wait. Wasn't Ms. Kang Eun Seo wearing that?

394
00:30:12,997 --> 00:30:15,766
I keep forgetting to put that away.

395
00:30:15,767 --> 00:30:17,767
The police didn't take it as evidence?

396
00:30:17,838 --> 00:30:20,036
No. They got in touch with her family

397
00:30:20,037 --> 00:30:21,338
and asked us to throw it out.

398
00:30:22,878 --> 00:30:24,848
(Jeon Na Jung)

399
00:30:28,747 --> 00:30:29,747
Hello.

400
00:30:30,017 --> 00:30:32,017
I'm looking for someone. Have you seen her?

401
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:53,077
(We found it.)

402
00:30:53,078 --> 00:30:56,148
We found it. We got Jeon Na Jung's uniform, Chan.

403
00:30:58,178 --> 00:30:59,717
Chan, we found it.

404
00:30:59,878 --> 00:31:01,848
So make sure to find Professor Oh.

405
00:31:02,378 --> 00:31:05,148
Professor Oh, please come back.

406
00:31:16,128 --> 00:31:18,828
Be there. Please.

407
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:31,777
He now knows that we've been looking into the unidentified fingerprint.

408
00:31:32,378 --> 00:31:35,578
Kang Ja, get another agency to examine her uniform.

409
00:31:36,447 --> 00:31:37,848
And you must be especially careful.

410
00:32:48,658 --> 00:32:49,658
Soo Jae!

411
00:32:57,928 --> 00:32:58,967
What are you doing?

412
00:33:01,237 --> 00:33:02,267
Let go of me!

413
00:33:03,037 --> 00:33:04,938
- Don't move. - Let go of me.

414
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:09,578
Let go of me!

415
00:33:12,947 --> 00:33:14,848
Let go of me!

416
00:33:18,318 --> 00:33:21,057
What are you doing? What were you thinking?

417
00:33:21,158 --> 00:33:23,287
Let go. This is my life.

418
00:33:23,787 --> 00:33:25,527
I ruined my own life.

419
00:33:25,787 --> 00:33:27,328
Get a grip, Oh Soo Jae!

420
00:33:27,997 --> 00:33:29,668
You got hurt because of me.

421
00:33:30,898 --> 00:33:32,598
And I even killed my own daughter.

422
00:33:33,568 --> 00:33:36,868
I just met her! My daughter!

423
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:46,977
That's not true. It's not your fault.

424
00:33:47,318 --> 00:33:50,017
No. It's my fault.

425
00:33:51,118 --> 00:33:53,118
This is the result of my decisions.

426
00:33:53,688 --> 00:33:55,257
My foolish decisions.

427
00:33:57,928 --> 00:34:00,057
And I'm paying the price for them...

428
00:34:00,557 --> 00:34:01,797
like this.

429
00:34:06,997 --> 00:34:09,267
I can't fathom what it means to lose a child...

430
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:12,807
or how painful it must be.

431
00:34:14,238 --> 00:34:16,448
But don't blame yourself for it.

432
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:22,448
Whenever I thought Na Jung was dead because of me,

433
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:24,517
I was in misery.

434
00:34:24,988 --> 00:34:28,088
I don't want you to be in misery. So I'm begging you.

435
00:34:29,517 --> 00:34:30,758
And my life...

436
00:34:31,927 --> 00:34:33,327
isn't so bad after all.

437
00:34:34,258 --> 00:34:37,898
The rough patch I went through wasn't your fault.

438
00:34:39,128 --> 00:34:41,438
It was because of those jerks who take other people's lives lightly.

439
00:34:43,267 --> 00:34:46,907
It won't make my mistakes go away.

440
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,807
I can't say I wasn't responsible at all for what happened.

441
00:34:52,448 --> 00:34:53,878
Then take responsibility.

442
00:34:56,048 --> 00:34:58,918
It is a grave sin to mess up other people's lives.

443
00:34:59,318 --> 00:35:00,517
And it is an even graver sin...

444
00:35:01,318 --> 00:35:03,787
to have no shame or remorse after doing such a thing.

445
00:35:04,787 --> 00:35:06,088
Tell the world.

446
00:35:06,657 --> 00:35:08,128
That's how you can take responsibility.

447
00:35:12,168 --> 00:35:15,698
You can do it. I know that Oh Soo Jae can do it.

448
00:35:17,938 --> 00:35:19,267
You're the strongest...

449
00:35:20,177 --> 00:35:21,938
and most inspiring person I know, and you never give up.

450
00:35:24,378 --> 00:35:25,608
I...

451
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:29,148
might end up making another foolish decision.

452
00:35:32,488 --> 00:35:33,787
Then...

453
00:35:34,517 --> 00:35:36,287
you might get hurt again.

454
00:35:37,787 --> 00:35:39,028
I don't care.

455
00:35:40,198 --> 00:35:42,097
I'll be right by your side until the end.

456
00:35:48,968 --> 00:35:51,407
Let's go. Come with me.

457
00:35:53,307 --> 00:35:54,707
Everyone is waiting for you.

458
00:36:13,927 --> 00:36:15,897
With his confirmation hearing right around the corner,

459
00:36:15,898 --> 00:36:18,698
Justice Minister nominee Baek Jin Ki has been accused...

460
00:36:18,767 --> 00:36:20,596
of accepting a large bribe...

461
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:23,108
from Geummyeong Savings Bank in the past.

462
00:36:23,338 --> 00:36:25,706
He denied the allegation and stated that...

463
00:36:25,707 --> 00:36:27,907
the confirmation hearing would help uncover the truth.

464
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,536
As a graduate of Seojung University Law School,

465
00:36:29,537 --> 00:36:30,547
(Director Baek Jin Ki)

466
00:36:30,548 --> 00:36:32,707
he led Cheongju District Court, Suwon District Court...

467
00:36:33,948 --> 00:36:37,818
It looks like the thing with the savings bank will bog me down.

468
00:36:38,517 --> 00:36:40,818
I'll help you clear your name.

469
00:36:41,957 --> 00:36:43,858
Tell them you want to bring me in as your witness.

470
00:36:45,758 --> 00:36:48,057
Gosh, I feel bad asking for your help again.

471
00:36:48,327 --> 00:36:49,628
When you become Minister of Justice,

472
00:36:49,997 --> 00:36:51,628
round up some people I ask you to catch...

473
00:36:53,238 --> 00:36:55,168
and just help me bury some things.

474
00:36:56,938 --> 00:36:58,437
That's all I ask for.

475
00:36:58,438 --> 00:37:00,077
That's nothing hard.

476
00:37:01,278 --> 00:37:03,577
You never do anything unreasonable.

477
00:37:03,707 --> 00:37:06,407
The Bar Association will hold a disciplinary hearing for Soo Jae.

478
00:37:07,048 --> 00:37:09,117
A disciplinary hearing? What did Soo Jae do?

479
00:37:09,247 --> 00:37:12,387
I let her grow too big. I should've ousted her sooner.

480
00:37:12,988 --> 00:37:15,088
Anyway, you'll have to help me out.

481
00:37:15,918 --> 00:37:18,157
You'll need my help?

482
00:37:18,588 --> 00:37:20,996
If Soo Jae were to appeal against the disciplinary decision...

483
00:37:20,997 --> 00:37:22,956
and file a complaint to the Ministry of Justice...

484
00:37:22,957 --> 00:37:24,068
Dismiss her appeal.

485
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:27,698
Okay.

486
00:37:30,037 --> 00:37:33,278
- I have an appointment. See you. - All right, bye.

487
00:37:40,677 --> 00:37:43,617
Chairman Choi was the one who told the media about the savings bank.

488
00:37:44,418 --> 00:37:47,188
Because I'd reach out to him for help if I were in a pickle.

489
00:37:47,688 --> 00:37:49,258
It planned it.

490
00:37:49,557 --> 00:37:50,887
He set this all up...

491
00:37:51,557 --> 00:37:53,797
to make sure Ms. Oh would be reprimanded...

492
00:37:53,798 --> 00:37:54,927
while pretending to be helping you.

493
00:37:56,898 --> 00:37:58,128
In the worst-case scenario,

494
00:37:58,628 --> 00:38:01,497
she'll be disbarred permanently.

495
00:38:01,938 --> 00:38:05,008
No, I bet that is exactly what he is after.

496
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:08,108
He wants to tie her hands and feet so she can't do anything.

497
00:38:08,637 --> 00:38:10,807
He's extremely meticulous and ruthless.

498
00:38:12,307 --> 00:38:14,878
I hope the analysis is completed before your confirmation hearing.

499
00:38:15,778 --> 00:38:19,088
There was only a small amount of blood, and too much time has passed.

500
00:38:20,287 --> 00:38:22,957
We'll get the results back before then. I'm sure of it.

501
00:38:24,387 --> 00:38:26,156
We're tackling the confirmation hearing...

502
00:38:26,157 --> 00:38:27,758
and the disciplinary hearing at the same time.

503
00:38:28,528 --> 00:38:31,767
The confirmation hearing will go well if I testify.

504
00:38:32,767 --> 00:38:34,968
Then the police, prosecution, and even the Ministry of Justice...

505
00:38:35,298 --> 00:38:36,468
will be in our hands.

506
00:38:38,508 --> 00:38:40,378
So focus on getting ready for the disciplinary hearing.

507
00:38:40,508 --> 00:38:42,377
If you'd like her to be disbarred,

508
00:38:42,378 --> 00:38:44,306
a couple of mistakes won't do.

509
00:38:44,307 --> 00:38:46,976
Unless the hearing is being held after two or more...

510
00:38:46,977 --> 00:38:48,317
prior disciplinary actions,

511
00:38:48,318 --> 00:38:50,687
or what she did was unacceptable to the point...

512
00:38:50,688 --> 00:38:52,447
that she should be deemed unfit to carry out her duties as a lawyer.

513
00:38:52,448 --> 00:38:55,117
What Soo Jae did was unacceptable. Was it not?

514
00:38:56,057 --> 00:38:58,287
And she is not capable of performing her duties properly.

515
00:38:58,427 --> 00:39:00,297
Right. She clearly can't do her job.

516
00:39:00,298 --> 00:39:02,858
And what she did was beyond unacceptable.

517
00:39:03,267 --> 00:39:06,068
Here are some disbarment cases.

518
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:08,136
Violations of rules regarding decorum,

519
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,967
violations of rules against name lending,

520
00:39:09,968 --> 00:39:12,567
opening a firm with a non-lawyer, and so on.

521
00:39:12,568 --> 00:39:14,206
They had violated various rules,

522
00:39:14,207 --> 00:39:17,048
and they were only disbarred after all the details were verified.

523
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:19,877
Some of them appealed against the decision,

524
00:39:19,878 --> 00:39:21,877
and the Ministry of Justice sided with them.

525
00:39:21,878 --> 00:39:24,918
No. In her case, the Ministry of Justice will dismiss her appeal.

526
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:29,927
We must make sure she is disbarred permanently.

527
00:39:30,157 --> 00:39:31,657
Yes. Sure thing, sir.

528
00:39:32,887 --> 00:39:36,227
I'll cast my net wide and find anything and everything we can use.

529
00:39:36,427 --> 00:39:38,468
As you know, I handled many sensitive matters...

530
00:39:38,698 --> 00:39:39,997
when I was in the Special Investigation Division.

531
00:39:40,338 --> 00:39:42,468
I already spoke with one member of the disciplinary committee.

532
00:39:43,367 --> 00:39:44,406
Put your worries to rest.

533
00:39:44,407 --> 00:39:47,108
Look into every case she worked on after joining TK,

534
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:49,608
and talk to every associate that she fired.

535
00:39:50,707 --> 00:39:53,418
Oh Soo Jae. We must finish her off once and for all.

536
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:54,977
Yes, sir.

537
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:56,787
Also,

538
00:39:57,948 --> 00:40:01,116
look into the cases that she worked on...

539
00:40:01,117 --> 00:40:02,258
before she joined TK as well.

540

541
00:40:06,528 --> 00:40:07,898
that's what we'll use.

542
00:40:08,358 --> 00:40:09,358
Yes, sir.

543
00:40:28,548 --> 00:40:32,017
Gosh, I wish we could fill in just two more blanks.

544
00:40:32,188 --> 00:40:35,088
We've figured out how Jeon Na Jung and Kang Eun Seo met.

545
00:40:35,557 --> 00:40:37,627
We've also figured out that Chairman Choi Tae Guk...

546
00:40:37,628 --> 00:40:40,597
was behind the deaths of Hong Seok Pal and Park So Young.

547
00:40:41,427 --> 00:40:43,898
I believe this is enough to move public opinion.

548
00:40:44,227 --> 00:40:46,266
The public will demand an investigation,

549
00:40:46,267 --> 00:40:49,097
and the prosecution won't be able to neglect it.

550
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:51,767
That's enough to turn the tables.

551

without permission and it was illegal.

But there's plenty of other evidence.

She definitely said she couldn't submit it as evidence.

00:48:25,188 --> 00:48:27,927
She committed illegal action a lawyer should never do.

657
00:48:28,597 --> 00:48:31,726
These charges violate Article 24.1 of Attorneys-at-Law Act,

658
00:48:31,727 --> 00:48:33,397
the duty to keep the dignity and decorum as a lawyer.

659
00:48:33,398 --> 00:48:34,667
Article 24.2,

660
00:48:34,668 --> 00:48:37,536
the duty not to cover up the truth and to tell only the truth,

661
00:48:37,537 --> 00:48:41,477
and Article 1.1, the duty to uphold fundamental rights and protection.

662
00:48:42,477 --> 00:48:45,148
Subject, do you admit to the charges?

663
00:48:47,918 --> 00:48:49,778
Subject, do you admit to the charges?

664
00:48:52,117 --> 00:48:53,548
I will not answer.

665
00:48:58,488 --> 00:49:01,457
Then I'll move on.

666
00:49:03,597 --> 00:49:04,767
Nominee.

667
00:49:05,427 --> 00:49:06,467
You were the director...

668
00:49:06,468 --> 00:49:08,637
of Judicial Research and Training Institute in 2008.

669
00:49:08,867 --> 00:49:12,108
Elaborate on the suspicion you received 200,000 dollars.

670
00:49:13,267 --> 00:49:16,477
First of all, I would like to apologize...

671
00:49:17,448 --> 00:49:20,207
to the people for causing concern.

672
00:49:20,617 --> 00:49:24,048
Ma'am, the witness who will objectively testify...

673
00:49:24,188 --> 00:49:27,516
regarding the bribery suspicion is here today.

674
00:49:27,517 --> 00:49:30,886
No. You can easily give us an answer.

675
00:49:30,887 --> 00:49:33,028
Why are you making someone else to testify for you?

676
00:49:33,287 --> 00:49:34,996
Do you think this hearing is a joke?

677
00:49:34,997 --> 00:49:36,996
Hold on.

678
00:49:36,997 --> 00:49:38,897
Assemblywoman Lee.

679
00:49:38,898 --> 00:49:40,697
The witness is here.

680
00:49:40,698 --> 00:49:43,237
We can just listen to the witness.

681
00:49:43,238 --> 00:49:45,366
Why are you interfering?

682
00:49:45,367 --> 00:49:48,806
How rude of you! You ought to have some manners!

683
00:49:48,807 --> 00:49:49,807
Be quiet!

684
00:49:49,808 --> 00:49:52,676
The way you speak is lowering our hearing's class!

685
00:49:52,677 --> 00:49:55,176
- Look who's talking! - You need to be quiet!

686
00:49:55,177 --> 00:49:57,548
- How dare you? - You should be quiet.

687
00:49:58,218 --> 00:49:59,847
(Nominee of a public office)

688
00:50:01,117 --> 00:50:02,318
Everyone,

689
00:50:02,418 --> 00:50:03,418
quiet down!

690
00:50:03,419 --> 00:50:04,426
(Head of Committee, Cho Nam Hee)

691
00:50:04,427 --> 00:50:05,427
Please be quiet.

692
00:50:05,428 --> 00:50:07,027
- Come on. Seriously. - Gosh.

693
00:50:07,028 --> 00:50:08,258
(Lee In Soo)

694
00:50:08,457 --> 00:50:10,798
Witness, come on in.

695
00:50:21,637 --> 00:50:23,677
(Witness)

696
00:50:26,747 --> 00:50:28,148
My name is Choi Tae Guk.

697
00:50:28,718 --> 00:50:32,517
All right. Ma'am, you may question the witness.

698
00:50:33,517 --> 00:50:34,588
Witness.

699
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:38,926
You were the leader of the special task force team...

700
00:50:38,927 --> 00:50:41,528
to investigate the corruption behind Geummyeong Savings Bank in 2008

701
00:50:41,727 --> 00:50:44,628
Elaborate on your investigation in 2008.

702
00:50:46,227 --> 00:50:48,097
Back then, the nominee...

703
00:50:50,807 --> 00:50:52,307
accepted the bribe.

704
00:50:53,367 --> 00:50:55,077
- What? - Be quiet.

705
00:50:56,108 --> 00:50:58,778
- Gosh. Unbelievable. - He took the bribe.

706
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:01,048
- Really? - He took the money?

707
00:51:01,117 --> 00:51:02,218
Chairman Choi.

708
00:51:03,918 --> 00:51:05,847
What are you talking about?

709
00:51:06,988 --> 00:51:08,858
I will make myself very clear.

710
00:51:11,287 --> 00:51:13,628
In 2008, the nominee of the Minister of Justice...

711
00:51:13,827 --> 00:51:16,556
received 200,000 dollars from a broker named Geum Seok Chae...

712
00:51:16,557 --> 00:51:19,397
for introducing the broker to the president...

713
00:51:19,398 --> 00:51:21,997
of Geummyeong Savings Bank, Geum Sae Yong.

714
00:51:22,468 --> 00:51:25,468
When the bank president had to stand trial for another case,

715
00:51:26,367 --> 00:51:27,907
he even asked a judge who was also his junior...

716
00:51:28,407 --> 00:51:30,608
to go easy on the bank president.

717
00:51:31,407 --> 00:51:33,406
I had no idea about this back then.

718
00:51:33,407 --> 00:51:35,718
But I recently received an anonymous letter,

719
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,747
disclosing this information and came to knowledge.

720
00:51:39,588 --> 00:51:41,387
I would like to apologize...

721
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:44,358
to everyone here and the people...

722
00:51:45,188 --> 00:51:47,088
for not being more thorough with my investigation.

723
00:51:49,858 --> 00:51:52,366
- What? - What is this about?

724
00:51:52,367 --> 00:51:54,468
- What's going on? - Is this true?

725
00:51:54,698 --> 00:51:56,636
- What do you mean? - What?

726
00:51:56,637 --> 00:51:58,867
- What is this? - How could he?

727
00:52:05,948 --> 00:52:09,477
The birth father of Kang Eun Seo was Director Baek Jin Ki.

728
00:52:12,818 --> 00:52:14,156
She's his illegitimate child?

729
00:52:14,157 --> 00:52:15,517
And Yoon Se Pil...

730
00:52:15,918 --> 00:52:18,358
had been Kang Eun Seo's lover before the incident.

731
00:52:19,287 --> 00:52:20,557
What in the world...

732
00:52:22,497 --> 00:52:23,597
And this.

733
00:52:26,767 --> 00:52:31,008
As you instructed, I looked into the American corporation...

734
00:52:31,207 --> 00:52:33,037
that bought Chairman Han's house in Samjung-dong.

735
00:52:33,207 --> 00:52:34,577
The name of the CEO...

736
00:52:35,077 --> 00:52:37,747
was Yoon Se Pil's American name.

737
00:52:38,148 --> 00:52:39,207
What?

738
00:52:43,378 --> 00:52:45,847
That was the day Jeon Na Jung whose skeleton was found in...

739
00:52:46,188 --> 00:52:47,918
Yeongpyeong District was murdered.

740
00:52:48,157 --> 00:52:49,218
That day,

741
00:52:50,617 --> 00:52:52,886
a woman in her 20s was transported to the hospital...

742
00:52:52,887 --> 00:52:54,128
in the middle of the night after a car accident.

743
00:52:56,057 --> 00:52:57,427
Baek Jin Ki.

744
00:52:58,698 --> 00:52:59,927
Yoon Se Pil.

745
00:53:02,168 --> 00:53:03,497
Oh Soo Jae.

746
00:53:06,238 --> 00:53:07,977
How dare they?

747
00:53:12,508 --> 00:53:14,677
The nominee received the bribe...

748
00:53:15,548 --> 00:53:18,088
to take care of his illegitimate child and his mistress.

749
00:53:18,218 --> 00:53:20,617
And when her daughter got into a car accident ten years ago,

750
00:53:20,957 --> 00:53:22,687
he deluded himself that...

751
00:53:22,688 --> 00:53:25,588
she had been in another incident before the car accident.

752
00:53:27,057 --> 00:53:30,398
Moreover, he fixated that the location of the car accident...

753
00:53:30,597 --> 00:53:34,497
was around Hansu Group's chairman, Han Sung Bum's house.

754
00:53:34,668 --> 00:53:37,508
My son who often went over to his house,

755
00:53:38,407 --> 00:53:39,537
Chairman Han's son,

756
00:53:40,468 --> 00:53:44,008
and the son of the presidential candidate, Lee In Soo.

757
00:53:44,307 --> 00:53:45,847
He even spread a rumor...

758
00:53:46,548 --> 00:53:48,878
that the three of them were the suspects.

759
00:53:51,887 --> 00:53:53,588
They are the suspects.

760
00:53:54,557 --> 00:53:57,057
They kidnapped my daughter, took her to that house,

761
00:53:57,218 --> 00:53:58,927
and violated her.

762
00:53:59,157 --> 00:54:02,096
And when she tried to run away, she got into a car accident.

763
00:54:02,097 --> 00:54:03,657
Now, she has a cognitive issue.

764
00:54:03,827 --> 00:54:06,467
- What is this about? - What's going on?

765
00:54:06,468 --> 00:54:08,997
- That's a rumor! - No, it's not a rumor.

766
00:54:09,438 --> 00:54:11,307
Get a grip, Jin Ki.

767
00:54:11,537 --> 00:54:13,307
They are the suspects.

768
00:54:13,867 --> 00:54:15,238
I have evidence.

769
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:17,337
The evidence is coming.

770
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:19,676
- What are you doing? - What is this?

771
00:54:19,677 --> 00:54:21,476
- This is so irrelevant! - What on earth is this?

772
00:54:21,477 --> 00:54:24,346
- This is ridiculous. - We can't proceed with this!

773
00:54:24,347 --> 00:54:26,817
- Hey, listen. - Come on.

774
00:54:26,818 --> 00:54:29,386
- Sit back down! - What is this?

775
00:54:29,387 --> 00:54:32,357
- What's going on? - You think this is a joke?

776
00:54:32,358 --> 00:54:35,357
- Stop interfering! - I can't believe this.

777
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:37,968
- Come on. - What is this?

778
00:54:43,338 --> 00:54:44,637
How dare you?

779
00:54:45,367 --> 00:54:48,977
Did you think you could really beat me, Jin Ki?

780
00:54:50,438 --> 00:54:52,307
(Witness)

781
00:54:54,218 --> 00:54:57,346
Well, when Ms. Park So Young was alive,

782
00:54:57,347 --> 00:54:59,347
she told me she wanted to die.

783
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:02,457
That's how harsh she was on Ms. Park.

784
00:55:14,568 --> 00:55:15,938
Was this your dream?

785
00:55:17,137 --> 00:55:19,137
Becoming a lawyer who threatens the victim...

786
00:55:19,468 --> 00:55:21,207
and makes them want to kill themselves.

787
00:55:22,338 --> 00:55:23,807
Was that your dream?

788
00:55:24,037 --> 00:55:25,108
Why would you die?

789
00:55:26,008 --> 00:55:27,177
You should live.

790
00:55:28,747 --> 00:55:30,278
Curse me as you keep living.

791
00:55:31,418 --> 00:55:34,688
Ms. Park was very unstable back then.

792
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:38,628
Then the subject showed Ms. Park her family photo...

793
00:55:38,758 --> 00:55:40,286
and threatened her,

794
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,927
saying she would expose Ms. Park to her family.

795
00:55:42,497 --> 00:55:45,567
The subject pressured Ms. Park aggressively to say...

796
00:55:45,568 --> 00:55:47,298
that she had never met An Kang Won.

797
00:55:47,468 --> 00:55:50,338
Let's say you are the victim and we go to court.

798
00:55:50,438 --> 00:55:52,707
Do you think you can beat me in court, 9th class?

799
00:55:55,207 --> 00:55:56,407
Ms. Park.

800
00:55:57,878 --> 00:56:00,508
You lost your sense of judgment because you were drunk.

801
00:56:01,648 --> 00:56:03,747
You never even met Congressman An.

802
00:56:04,887 --> 00:56:07,088
The end. Okay?

803
00:56:12,488 --> 00:56:13,757
Excuse me, sir.

804
00:56:13,758 --> 00:56:16,358
The subject had to corner Ms. Park during the meeting...

805
00:56:16,698 --> 00:56:19,326
as she was representing a client with a possible rape charge.

806
00:56:19,327 --> 00:56:22,468
So there were things the subject had to confirm.

807
00:56:22,597 --> 00:56:24,738
That's the duty of a lawyer.

808
00:56:25,037 --> 00:56:28,108
We have something else we must confirm.

809
00:56:31,577 --> 00:56:33,508
(Subject Oh Soo Jae)

810
00:56:43,488 --> 00:56:45,187
Back then,

811
00:56:45,188 --> 00:56:47,628
the subject and her client had a personal relationship.

812
00:56:48,057 --> 00:56:50,758
And the subject still cornered Park So Young.

813
00:56:51,398 --> 00:56:52,427
Sir.

814
00:56:52,528 --> 00:56:55,167
He can't disclose irrelevant information to this hearing.

815
00:56:55,168 --> 00:56:58,206
He's infringing on her human rights! You must stop him.

816
00:56:58,207 --> 00:57:02,338
I'm not sure. I don't think he's infringing on her rights.

817
00:57:11,117 --> 00:57:12,818
(Lawyer Song Mi Rim)

818
00:57:23,827 --> 00:57:24,968
Sir.

819
00:57:26,168 --> 00:57:27,838
I would like to request a recess.

820
00:57:28,938 --> 00:57:31,237
I'd like to share my disappointment for ambushing us...

821
00:57:31,238 --> 00:57:33,206
with evidence we haven't confirmed...

822
00:57:33,207 --> 00:57:34,207
and digressing from the nature of this hearing.

823
00:57:34,577 --> 00:57:35,938
And I'd like a recess.

824
00:57:39,378 --> 00:57:40,778
(Board Member Hong Gi Pyo)

825
00:57:42,148 --> 00:57:45,747
All right. We will begin our second hearing tomorrow.

826
00:57:47,787 --> 00:57:49,918
(Disciplinary Board of Korean Bar Association)

827
00:57:58,298 --> 00:57:59,727
(Subject Oh Soo Jae)

828
00:58:17,648 --> 00:58:19,048
- She's coming out. - She's coming out.

829
00:58:20,387 --> 00:58:22,456
Do you admit to the raised charges during the hearing?

830
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:24,426
Is it true you illegally ran a DNA test?

831
00:58:24,427 --> 00:58:26,187
Do you admit that you used her family to threaten her?

832
00:58:26,188 --> 00:58:27,426
Why did you not answer that?

833
00:58:27,427 --> 00:58:29,797
- Why did you request a recess? - Please answer us!

834
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:31,667
- A comment, please. - What is the truth?

835
00:58:31,668 --> 00:58:34,168
- Answer our questions. - Give us a comment!

836
00:58:34,438 --> 00:58:35,636
The famous lawyer, Oh Soo Jae of TK Law Firm,

837
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:40,167
will have her second disciplinary hearing tomorrow.

838
00:58:40,168 --> 00:58:42,136
According to our sources, the board is considering...

839
00:58:42,137 --> 00:58:44,406
permanent disbarment as her penalty.

840
00:58:44,407 --> 00:58:45,576
I'm reporting from the hearing.

841
00:58:45,577 --> 00:58:48,176
Baek Jin Ki's nomination hearing for the Minister of Justice...

842
00:58:48,177 --> 00:58:49,317
was held at the National Assembly Hall.

843
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:51,487
It's been confirmed that the nominee received...

844
00:58:51,488 --> 00:58:53,746
a bribe from a savings bank.

845
00:58:53,747 --> 00:58:55,917
A random fire broke out at a house in Samjung-dong...

846
00:58:55,918 --> 00:58:58,956
which used to belong to Hansu Group's chairman, Han Sung Bum.

847
00:58:58,957 --> 00:59:00,556
Screens had been installed outside the house...

848
00:59:00,557 --> 00:59:03,157
I should have set the house on fire ages ago.

849
00:59:03,398 --> 00:59:07,227
That's why that rat, Yoon Se Pil, bought that house.

850
00:59:07,798 --> 00:59:10,398
I'm more shocked by Baek Jin Ki.

851
00:59:10,767 --> 00:59:12,608
He pretended to be dense.

852
00:59:12,668 --> 00:59:15,777
But that jerk had been aiming for our heads this whole time.

853
00:59:15,778 --> 00:59:18,907
No. The most ridiculous one was Oh Soo Jae.

854
00:59:19,477 --> 00:59:22,477
That little wench joined hands with them, you know.

855
00:59:22,918 --> 00:59:24,077
Come on in.

856
00:59:24,847 --> 00:59:27,088
Gosh, Chairman Choi. Come on in.

857
00:59:27,218 --> 00:59:30,616
You've been everywhere today. What a busy man.

858
00:59:30,617 --> 00:59:31,757
Gosh.

859
00:59:31,758 --> 00:59:34,287
When did you prepare everything?

860
00:59:34,387 --> 00:59:36,798
You're indeed extraordinary.

861
00:59:36,827 --> 00:59:38,327
Have a seat, Mr. Hope.

862
00:59:40,698 --> 00:59:42,568
You want me to announce that I'm not selling?

863
00:59:43,537 --> 00:59:47,168
If I could, I would want to destroy that rat, Yoon Se Pil.

864
00:59:47,878 --> 00:59:50,238
But if we cancel it, we'll be providing the cause.

865
00:59:50,907 --> 00:59:52,277
On top of that, what about the penalty?

866
00:59:52,278 --> 00:59:53,948
It's 800 million dollars.

867
00:59:54,448 --> 00:59:57,818
And you will have to pay three times the penalty as well...

868
00:59:58,387 --> 01:00:02,617
because of the contract Yoon Se Pil and Oh Soo Jae conspired together.

869
01:00:03,617 --> 01:00:05,528
You don't have to pay a single penny.

870
01:00:05,758 --> 01:00:06,858
Not even a single penny?

871
01:00:08,528 --> 01:00:10,727
Is that possible?

872
01:00:11,668 --> 01:00:14,097
Doesn't he have to at least pay back the down payment?

873
01:00:14,497 --> 01:00:16,838
Article 9.5 of the contract, cancelation of the contract.

874
01:00:17,267 --> 01:00:19,108
"If the buyer provides a cause..."

875
01:00:19,367 --> 01:00:21,176
"to break the mutual trust..."

876
01:00:21,177 --> 01:00:23,307
"or a risk that might damage the reputation,"

877
01:00:24,307 --> 01:00:26,207
"the seller can cancel the contract."

878
01:00:26,948 --> 01:00:30,517
"Under this clause, the penalty and the down payment..."

879
01:00:32,418 --> 01:00:34,048
"will be vested in the seller."

880
01:00:35,017 --> 01:00:36,057
Go on.

881
01:00:36,488 --> 01:00:39,327
Yoon Se Pil broke our trust.

882
01:00:39,457 --> 01:00:40,457
Right.

883
01:00:40,458 --> 01:00:42,627
He concealed his agenda of bringing us down.

884
01:00:42,628 --> 01:00:45,168
This became the reason our trust would never be restored.

885
01:00:45,727 --> 01:00:48,367
I already looked into the legal side of this plan.

886
01:00:49,267 --> 01:00:52,407
You should make an official statement.

887
01:00:53,668 --> 01:00:57,338
And you can keep 400 million dollars.

888
01:01:03,778 --> 01:01:06,386
You're about to get 400 million dollars...

889
01:01:06,387 --> 01:01:08,258
without doing anything.

890
01:01:08,557 --> 01:01:10,387
Hold on a second.

891
01:01:13,727 --> 01:01:17,457
Gosh. This is crazy, Chairman Choi.

892
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:21,168
You made 400 million dollars!

893
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:28,807
What a relief. We can split that among ourselves.

894
01:01:29,037 --> 01:01:30,938
- Gosh. - Thank you.

895
01:01:34,448 --> 01:01:36,718
They look like a bunch of defeated soldiers.

896
01:01:38,117 --> 01:01:40,117
How are they going to survive tomorrow's hearing?

897
01:01:40,548 --> 01:01:43,818
I heard all of them would be going in as her special lawyers.

898
01:01:44,887 --> 01:01:45,987
I'm worried.

899
01:01:45,988 --> 01:01:49,758
But doesn't it look like they are all waiting for something?

900
01:01:50,327 --> 01:01:51,398
Right.

901
01:02:15,188 --> 01:02:17,957
What about your son? Did you send him off well?

902
01:02:18,028 --> 01:02:20,287
Thanks to your generosity,

903
01:02:21,927 --> 01:02:23,398
I was able to send him off well.

904
01:02:23,628 --> 01:02:25,628
I lost my granddaughter, so I'm miserable too.

905
01:02:26,028 --> 01:02:27,767
But we must continue to live.

906
01:02:28,997 --> 01:02:31,407
The confirmation hearing and the disciplinary hearing are all hectic.

907
01:02:34,108 --> 01:02:35,907
What did you want to tell me?

908
01:02:38,508 --> 01:02:41,778
Thanks to your help, I was able to stop Baek Jin Ki, Yoon Se Pil,

909
01:02:41,918 --> 01:02:44,247
and Soo Jae from bringing me down.

910
01:02:45,718 --> 01:02:47,548
But if this doesn't turn out the way I envision,

911
01:02:49,318 --> 01:02:51,387
I need you to take the fall for everything.

912
01:02:53,887 --> 01:02:56,927
For what happened to Park So Young, Hong Seok Pal, No Byung Chul,

913
01:02:58,198 --> 01:03:00,798
Jeon Na Jung from ten years ago,

914
01:03:01,298 --> 01:03:03,168
and what happened to Kang Eun Seo?

915
01:03:10,037 --> 01:03:13,677
Yes, sir. I'll take the fall for everything.

916
01:03:16,247 --> 01:03:17,918
My son didn't have a mother...

917
01:03:18,247 --> 01:03:21,017
and only suffered in his life because he had me as his father.

918
01:03:22,657 --> 01:03:24,157
Now that he's not here,

919
01:03:25,557 --> 01:03:27,227
I have no regrets about this world.

920
01:03:28,028 --> 01:03:29,128
Okay.

921
01:03:29,657 --> 01:03:32,167
If you do this for me, I'll take care of you.

922
01:03:32,168 --> 01:03:33,597
You don't have to worry about that.

923
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:01,726
Next news.

924
01:04:01,727 --> 01:04:03,797
- Oh Soo Jae's second hearing... - Will you explain yourself today?

925
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:06,067
- will be broadcast all over Korea. - Do you think this is fair?

926
01:04:06,068 --> 01:04:08,136
- In the first hearing, - What do you think about that?

927
01:04:08,137 --> 01:04:11,096
she wasn't able to clarify the suspicions brought against her.

928
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:12,838
- You think the hearing is unfair? - So she asked for a recess.

929
01:04:12,968 --> 01:04:14,507
There's a possibility...

930
01:04:14,508 --> 01:04:16,237
that she may face a serious suspension...

931
01:04:16,238 --> 01:04:18,447
such as permanent disbarment at the second hearing.

932
01:04:18,448 --> 01:04:21,476
Candidate Lee In Soo announced that his son, Lee Si Hyuk,

933
01:04:21,477 --> 01:04:23,647
had nothing to do with the incident...

934
01:04:23,648 --> 01:04:26,116
Nominee Baek referred to when the nominee accused...

935
01:04:26,117 --> 01:04:28,047
his son of being a suspect.

936
01:04:28,048 --> 01:04:30,556
He said some people are slandering him before the election...

937
01:04:30,557 --> 01:04:32,687
Hansu Group made an official announcement...

938
01:04:32,688 --> 01:04:35,226
that they would be canceling the contract with SP Partners.

939
01:04:35,227 --> 01:04:37,397
According to Article 9.5 of our contract,

940
01:04:37,398 --> 01:04:39,397
this is considered a cause for cancelation.

941
01:04:39,398 --> 01:04:40,528
So we are canceling the contract...

942
01:04:40,628 --> 01:04:42,797
and keeping the down payment as the penalty.

943
01:04:42,798 --> 01:04:44,266
According to the confidentiality clause,

944
01:04:44,267 --> 01:04:46,507
we cannot disclose the cause of the broken trust from Mr. Yoon.

945
01:04:46,508 --> 01:04:49,137
I hope you can all be understanding.

946
01:04:49,608 --> 01:04:53,547
Moreover, as for the future sell-off of Hansu Bio,

947
01:04:53,548 --> 01:04:55,076
we will have an internal review first...

948
01:04:55,077 --> 01:04:57,778
and hold another press conference.

949
01:04:59,017 --> 01:05:00,287
Hello.

950
01:05:01,148 --> 01:05:04,857
We will now begin the second disciplinary hearing...

951
01:05:04,858 --> 01:05:06,787
for Oh Soo Jae.

952
01:05:07,957 --> 01:05:10,057
(Live broadcast of disciplinary hearing for Oh Soo Jae)

953
01:05:12,798 --> 01:05:15,338
The subject's lawyer will supplement her argument...

954
01:05:15,398 --> 01:05:18,508
for the first agenda we dealt with yesterday.

955
01:05:18,767 --> 01:05:20,467
This is regarding Yang Ji Ho's case...

956
01:05:20,468 --> 01:05:22,536
during the air pollution lawsuit against Hansu Bio.

957
01:05:22,537 --> 01:05:25,148
Regardless of the results,

958
01:05:25,448 --> 01:05:28,847
the subject helped the victim get away from his abusive parents.

959
01:05:28,977 --> 01:05:31,648
So she was able to protect the boy's human rights.

960
01:05:31,787 --> 01:05:33,246
After Yang Ji Ho was separated from his parents,

961
01:05:33,247 --> 01:05:35,687
he was sent to an adoption agency.

962
01:05:35,688 --> 01:05:37,188
And a worker from the agency is here to testify.

963
01:05:37,758 --> 01:05:41,057
Witness, please move to the witness stand.

964
01:05:45,968 --> 01:05:48,698
I'm a social worker. My name is Park Jung Min.

965
01:05:49,137 --> 01:05:52,907
Right after the trial, I got a call from Ms. Oh.

966
01:05:53,037 --> 01:05:55,677
She said that she would like to sponsor Ji Ho.

967
01:05:55,977 --> 01:05:58,706
She's been sponsoring Ji Ho...

968
01:05:58,707 --> 01:06:00,447
ever since the trial.

969
01:06:00,448 --> 01:06:04,048
And she's been giving our agency legal advice for free.

970
01:06:04,247 --> 01:06:05,817
That's not the nature of the charge.

971
01:06:05,818 --> 01:06:07,886
The nature of this problem is...

972
01:06:07,887 --> 01:06:11,017
the subject committed misconduct during Yang Ji Ho's trial.

973
01:06:11,157 --> 01:06:14,427
Right. Just because she started to sponsor the boy,

974
01:06:14,528 --> 01:06:16,858
it doesn't undo her misconduct of infringing on his rights.

975
01:06:17,128 --> 01:06:19,266
However, it does make sense...

976
01:06:19,267 --> 01:06:22,468
that she protected the boy's rights, instead of infringing on them.

977
01:06:22,767 --> 01:06:26,008
Ms. Shim Min Joo, what are you talking about?

978
01:06:27,068 --> 01:06:29,906
Will you argue that the subject also protected Ms. Park's rights,

979
01:06:29,907 --> 01:06:31,948
instead of infringing on them?

980
01:06:33,008 --> 01:06:35,647
Mr. Seo, why would you compare that to this case?

981
01:06:35,648 --> 01:06:36,817
What did you say?

982
01:06:36,818 --> 01:06:38,988
That's what you're doing.

983
01:06:39,088 --> 01:06:40,786
Ms. Shim, what did you just say?

984
01:06:40,787 --> 01:06:43,257
Mr. Seo, you haven't changed. Let's just drop it here.

985
01:06:43,258 --> 01:06:45,258
- Ms. Shim! - Stop it.

986
01:06:45,387 --> 01:06:46,588
Stop it.

987
01:06:46,988 --> 01:06:48,027

01:06:51,427 --> 01:06:52,568
Mr. Seo.

991
01:06:53,168 --> 01:06:56,997
Thank you for bringing up Ms. Park's death first.

(Disciplinary Board of Korean Bar Association)

993
01:07:12,148 --> 01:07:13,318
What's this?

994
01:07:13,847 --> 01:07:17,057
I'm telling you the true nature of Ms. Park's death.

995
01:07:18,157 --> 01:07:21,457
The nature is that you cornered Park So Young too aggressively,

996
01:07:22,227 --> 01:07:24,557
so you did something you shouldn't have as a lawyer.

997
01:07:24,858 --> 01:07:26,096
That's why...

998
01:07:26,097 --> 01:07:27,927
That's why Ms. Park So Young died?

999
01:07:28,968 --> 01:07:30,536
Do you still believe that?

1000
01:07:30,537 --> 01:07:34,407
No. Hong Seok Pal murdered Park So Young.

1001
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:38,307
Hong Seok Pal didn't murder Park So Young.

1002
01:07:40,548 --> 01:07:41,847
It was...

1003
01:07:43,278 --> 01:07:44,677
Chairman Choi Tae Guk of TK Law Firm.

1004
01:07:55,758 --> 01:07:58,727
(Why Her?)

1005
01:08:18,948 --> 01:08:22,817
You don't have any evidence that he killed her!

1006
01:08:22,818 --> 01:08:25,057
There's no evidence. It's a groundless accusation.

1007
01:08:27,127 --> 01:08:29,357
I would like to request Kim Dong Gu,

1008
01:08:29,358 --> 01:08:31,457
the defendant of the trial, as a witness.

1009
01:08:31,458 --> 01:08:33,427
Kim Dong Gu? He's here?

1010
01:08:33,467 --> 01:08:34,467
I'm Kim Dong Gu.

1011
01:08:34,468 --> 01:08:37,197
His murder charge was proven because of his fingerprints!

1012
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:39,107
- Did you find out? - Yes, we did.

1013
01:08:39,108 --> 01:08:41,778
I hope everyone faces punishment they all deserve.

1014
01:08:43,307 --> 01:08:45,506
Everything has unfolded right before your eyes.

1015
01:08:45,507 --> 01:08:46,677
Go see it for yourself.
