(Episode 5)

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,899
Hey, it's me. You're almost here?

5
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,499
Come to the second floor.

6
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:45,679
What are you doing?

7
00:00:45,749 --> 00:00:47,079
Who are you?

8
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,410
It's 23 Yulseo-ro 2-Gil. Hurry!

9
00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:57,649
Professor Oh.

10
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,319
Professor Oh!

11
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,150
Professor Oh!

12
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,280
Professor Oh!

13
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:37,359
Professor Oh.

14
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:39,430
Are you all right?

15
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,470
Hold on.

16
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,500
Professor Oh.

17
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:17,769
Professor Oh.

18
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,470
Professor Oh.

19
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,379
A female with a laceration on her shoulder. Mental status, drowsy.

20
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,180
The blood pressure is normal. Arriving in ten minutes.

21
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:41,090
(Emergency Medical Center)

22
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:46,960
A big shard of glass got under your shirt.

23
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,359
Thank goodness it didn't touch any large vessels.

24
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:52,769
But you'll still need to wait ten days to get the stitches removed.

25
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:53,970
Okay.

26
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,400
Your brother is in the waiting room.

27
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:04,340
Are you all right?

28
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:08,578
You remember nothing about the assailant...

29
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:10,319
including his face and voice?

30
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,549
Right, I don't.

31
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:14,858
Is there anyone who could be holding a grudge against you?

32
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:16,919
Can you think of anyone who'd do this to you?

33
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:20,060
Well, you don't need to investigate this incident.

34
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,159
- Pardon? - But you're hurt.

35
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,530
Nothing's been stolen,

36
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,340
and I got hurt because I tripped and fell.

37
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,710
You must be busy. Don't bother investigating a petty theft case.

38
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,869
I don't want this to turn into a headache.

39
00:04:36,179 --> 00:04:37,748
We'll just close the case, then.

40
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:39,309
Don't change your word later.

41
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,749
- I won't. - Let's go.

42
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:53,989
Hey, you have blood on your clothes.

43
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,499
Why did you tell the cops not to investigate it?

44
00:04:57,629 --> 00:04:59,229
It's none of your business. You stay out of it.

45
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,400
Thanks for your help, but it is my decision to make.

46
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,049
These...

47
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,419
Why are these...

48
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,418
I asked them to move the boxes to my place.

49
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,260
Your door lock is all broken.

50
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:25,289
Someone else might try to sneak in.

51
00:05:27,489 --> 00:05:29,559
Why do you keep crossing the line?

52
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:33,369
You think I called you because I didn't know how to call the police?

53
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,399
I called you because I didn't want the situation to get complicated.

54
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,409
But you called the police. And what is this?

55
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,809
You trusted that I'd get there before the police would.

56
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,379
That's why you called me.

57
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,309
I'll pick up the documents as soon as possible.

58
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,850
But I won't go to your place. That's crazy talk.

59
00:06:04,869 --> 00:06:05,999
What are you doing?

60
00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:08,368
Where to?

61
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,939
Listen to me, just this once.

62
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:15,080
If you leave like this, I'll stay up all night worrying about you.

63
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:17,640
And if something else happens to you after I let you go like this...

64
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,219
Then I'll go crazy. I will really lose my mind.

65
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,280
Don't go overboard.

66
00:06:24,989 --> 00:06:26,919
- Take us to Seojung Law School. - Sure.

67
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,090
My roommates' rooms are on the third floor.

68
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:04,859
They can't hear a thing when they're asleep,

69
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:06,429
so don't worry.

70
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,558
I put clean sheets on the bed in this room, so you can...

71
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:11,900
I can just sleep on the couch.

72
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,799
I sleep on the couch even at my place.

73
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,570
My bedroom is cold.

74
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,410
I see. Okay, then.

75
00:07:27,109 --> 00:07:28,520
Hey, by any chance...

76
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:33,189
Did you see that man? The black hat.

77
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,520
I did tussle with him in front of the building,

78
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,989
but he got away when I was distracted.

79
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:44,399
Did you tell the cops not to investigate...

80
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,830
because you believed that it was someone around you?

81
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,739
I'm not sure what's going on,

82
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:52,739
but the sell-off is supposed to happen soon.

83
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,840
You obtained their documents,

84
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,739
and if some of them are top-secret documents,

85
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,150
the person who did this must be someone related to the sell-off.

86
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,288
Someone who knows that you have top-secret documents...

87
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:09,590
and would be willing to hurt you to get their hands on them.

88
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,059
Someone like Choi Ju Wan, for example.

89
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,970
You...

90
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,010
I don't like this.

91
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:31,580
I really don't.

92
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,510
Knowing things about me, trying to figure me out,

93
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:37,988
and using what you know to guess who could be behind this.

94
00:08:37,989 --> 00:08:39,050
It bothers me.

95
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,149
It makes me uncomfortable.

96
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:49,330
Why would it bother her?

97
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,739
Why is this happening to you?

98
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:11,680
What kind of world are you dealing with?

99
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,920
(Tasanjiseok)

100
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:27,889
Oh, boy.

101
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:29,930
Hey, we should hurry.

102
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,670
Goodness, you scared me. Did you sleep here?

103
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,210
Hey, we went through hoops to move all the boxes last night.

104
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,239
What a dumb thief.

105
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:45,580
There was nothing to steal.

106
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:46,950
Oh, right.

107
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:49,778
Hey, is your professor okay? You said she was hurt.

108
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:52,450
- Darn it. Why did I fall asleep? - What's with him?

109
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,259
Hey. I bet he's still angry about being rejected.

110
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,690
He's taking it out on the couch.

111
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,100
No, I don't think he was rejected. I think he saved her.

112
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,300
I'll pick up the boxes as soon as possible.

113
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,970
Thanks to you, I could stay warm.

114
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:23,019
What? Last night?

115
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,850
I can't believe it. You nearly died!

116
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,420
Those scumbags. Should I just kill them all?

117
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:34,389
Gosh, seriously. I'd rip them to shreds if I could.

118
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,600
Don't get so worked up.

119
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,800
The situation is over now, so let's catch the culprit first.

120
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,800
That jerk took the flash drive.

121
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:46,009
What?

122
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:48,180
Who could it be?

123
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:50,979
The sell-off is supposed to happen soon.

124
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,909
You obtained their documents,

125
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,719
and if some of them are top-secret documents,

126
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,648
the person who did this must be someone related to the sell-off.

127
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:59,690
It must be someone related to the sell-off.

128
00:12:00,489 --> 00:12:02,519
And someone who knows me well.

129
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:05,829
And would be willing to hurt you to get their hands on them.

130
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,560
Someone who's willing to hurt me...

131
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:09,930
to get their hands on the flash drive.

132
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:12,330
Someone like Choi Ju Wan, for example.

133
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:16,739
Then there are several suspects.

134
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,710
Han Gi Taek, Han Sung Bum,

135
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:22,440
Choi Ju Wan,

136
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:25,909
and Chairman Choi?

137
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,580
Find out what they were all up to last night.

138
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,489
Okay.

139
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,989
I have to say, it's so awful.

140
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:37,258
I'd much rather think that it was just a petty thief.

141
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:38,259
I know.

142
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,858
Well, why don't you take today off?

143
00:12:42,859 --> 00:12:44,359
I'll look into it and let you know.

144
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:46,670
I ought to check...

145
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,970
the face they make...

146
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,769
when they see me after doing something like that.

147
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,180
(Chief Legal Officer Han Gi Taek)

148
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,590
Gosh, I didn't think this chair would be so uncomfortable.

149
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,129
Why didn't you call me? I would've visited you.

150
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,460
Is there a reason I can't come here?

151
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:20,269
No, of course not.

152
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:33,850
You know, the three things you mentioned last time.

153
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,080
First off, Park So Young and the three men.

154
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,449
You know how it is.

155
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,989
What could happen between a girl from a hostess bar and VIPs?

156
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:43,889
That was it, nothing more.

157
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,460
I believe my uncle helped her out a little,

158
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:49,899
but not the others.

159
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,229
Are you sure? Have you checked?

160
00:13:54,869 --> 00:13:56,269
It's not something I can check.

161
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:59,170
But I asked Hong Seok Pal...

162
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:01,639
because he knew the most about Park So Young.

163
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,350
Hong Seok Pal?

164
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:07,549
He's known as...

165
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,979
Chairman Han's henchman who does all his dirty work.

166
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:13,350
He often takes on demolition jobs for Hansu Construction,

167
00:14:13,489 --> 00:14:16,560
and he takes care of my uncle's personal requests from time to time.

168
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:20,060
So Chairman Han has a thug working alongside him.

169
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:26,200
There's always someone whose job is to clean up everyone's mess.

170
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,200
You know, things that he can't really take care of himself.

171
00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:32,670
He needs someone to quietly take care of all his dirty work.

172
00:14:33,609 --> 00:14:37,310
If you think about it, that's what you and I do as well.

173
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:40,709
Do you really want to think...

174
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,749
that we belong in the same category as that thug?

175
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:44,420
Seriously?

176
00:14:45,989 --> 00:14:48,249
The man who hurt me.

177
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,430
Was it Hong Seok Pal?

178
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,859
I suppose that thug could probably do anything and everything.

179
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,399
I bet he could steal things and hurt people too.

180
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,300
Well, that I don't know.

181
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:07,869
You asked me about their relationship with Park So Young.

182
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,509
They must've been fond of her.

183
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:11,978
She took care of all the VIPs.

184
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:13,580
Yes, exactly.

185
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,479
You know how it is.

186
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,850
Then why did they let her die?

187
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,590
Oh, and...

188
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:26,259
About the 27 million dollars...

189
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,259
It was all me.

190
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,570
I did it alone.

191
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:37,299
I swear. Who would I even plan something like that with?

192
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,670
I had to put my life on the line.

193
00:15:40,609 --> 00:15:43,909
And Master Kim was behind the decision to defer the sell-off.

194
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,979
He's a fortune-teller my uncle consults often.

195
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,849
The deal involves two billion dollars.

196
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,920
It was postponed because of what a fortune-teller said?

197
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,659
My gosh, that's funny.

198
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,229
Then will Master Kim be deciding when the deal will be resumed?

199
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,899
Thankfully, the talk went well last night.

200
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,460
It'll happen soon.

201
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:06,830
I see. I guess they had a good time at the birthday party yesterday.

202
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,070
I must say, Chairman Choi is really something.

203
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,638
I must say this one more time.

204
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:19,309
Happy birthday, our future President Lee In Soo.

205
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,509
Oh, my goodness.

206
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,580
- Happy birthday. - Thank you.

207
00:16:25,989 --> 00:16:29,320
My gosh. All I said was that I was craving sashimi.

208
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,158
Who would've thought you'd fill this pond with seawater...

209
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,389
and put in the saw-edged perch and blackhead sea bream?

210
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:36,999
My gosh, this is amazing!

211
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,869
I'm so touched, Chairman Han.

212
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,939
It was all Chairman Choi's idea.

213
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,368
He said we should fill the pond with seawater...

214
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:45,710
and throw live fish in it.

215
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:48,978
When he told me this idea, I was so impressed.

216
00:16:48,979 --> 00:16:51,279
I mean, it's ingenious. It's such a cute idea!

217
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:54,249
The smart ones always stand out no matter what they do.

218
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:56,319
This is why I'm so fond of Chairman Choi.

219
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,979
He's amazing.

220
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,090
Chairman Han.

221
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:07,129
What's going on with the sale of Hansu Bio?

222
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:12,869
Oh, that. Gi Taek suggested we resume the negotiations. Right?

223
00:17:13,629 --> 00:17:15,468
- Yes. - It's not a bad idea.

224
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:18,969
I know you wanted to cool things off, but the value might drop.

225
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:21,169
You should resume the deal before you lose the momentum.

226
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,040
Agreed. I should ask Master Kim...

227
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,549
when would be the best time to resume the negotiations.

228
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,350
Master Kim is so good.

229
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:32,589
- Hey, Gi Taek! Get the scoop net! - Yes?

230
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,948
The scoop net! Assemblyman Lee, come here!

231
00:17:34,949 --> 00:17:37,059
My gosh! This is so cool.

232
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,329
- Hey! - Oh, boy.

233
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,688
- You fool! Why did you fall? - Goodness.

234
00:17:41,689 --> 00:17:43,800
Look! Reel it in!

235
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,699
Oh, my! Look at this.

236
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,299
I think this every time I see him.

237
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,270
Chairman Choi never ceases to amaze me.

238
00:17:52,209 --> 00:17:55,379
It doesn't matter who it is. We all realize eventually that...

239
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,340
we're doing exactly what he wants us to do.

240
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,928
Sir, we're trying to analyse the footage...

241
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:13,530
using all our resources,

242
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,429
but the video keeps getting distorted when zoomed in,

243
00:18:18,969 --> 00:18:20,669
so the digital forensics team is having a hard time.

244
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:22,500
Hey.

245
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,868
When were you promoted to deputy chief prosecutor?

246
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:28,208
Just over two years ago, sir.

247
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:29,780
Two years?

248
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,750
Then you should know when to act tough and when to bow down.

249
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,580
You see,

250
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:38,648
if your company, which you named after yourself,

251
00:18:38,649 --> 00:18:41,149
kept getting bashed and chewed out,

252
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:43,719
would you like that?

253
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,689
No, sir. Of course not.

254
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:51,530
I was just about to tell you how I'm planning to wrap it up, sir.

255
00:18:54,899 --> 00:18:55,899
Here.

256
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:01,840
Let's have dinner sometime with Assemblyman Lee.

257
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:05,379
I'll do my very best, sir.

258
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:14,550
Sir, Mr. Kang would like to see you.

259
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,389
I thought I only had to meet with Deputy Chief Hwang today.

260
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,959
He has something to tell you regarding Ms. Oh.

261
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,859
Okay.

262
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:30,300
Yulseo Patrol Division received an incident report last night.

263
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,909
There was a burglary report from the building.

264
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:36,179
And it was Ms. Oh Soo Jae's building.

265
00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:38,708
One of her students at the law school called it in.

266
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:41,449
Apparently, Ms. Oh told the police not to investigate the case.

267
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:43,678
Why?

268
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,949
She said it wouldn't be necessary and that she didn't want a headache.

269
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,059
But the thing is, a reporter who happened to...

270
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,628
stop by the patrol division overheard it.

271
00:19:52,629 --> 00:19:55,530
You know, the woman Park So Young who jumped to her death.

272
00:19:55,899 --> 00:19:57,759
It was a reporter who was covering that case.

273
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,169
Don't you know that I'm sick and tired of dealing with trouble?

274
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:05,409
So I called and gave the reporter a scoop on something else.

275
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,540
Thank you, sir.

276
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,000
Mr. Ha, was it you?

277
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,230
Pardon me?

278
00:20:37,139 --> 00:20:39,839
Someone broke into Soo Jae's building.

279
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,139
Was it you?

280
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,639
I'm not quite following, sir.

281
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,209
If it wasn't you, who did it then?

282
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:48,149
Why wasn't it you?

283
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,980
I apologize, sir.

284
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,320
Find out who did it.

285
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,050
That thief took what should be in my hands.

286
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,919
Bring it to me.

287
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:26,589
Hey, can you open this? Don't ask me anything.

288
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,060
What is it? Why can't I ask questions?

289
00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:32,159
I'm not doing anything bad. Just open it. I'll tell you later.

290
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,030
- You're acting weird. - I just need to know...

291
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:38,060
Kang Ja! Chan is acting weird. I think he stole this.

292
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,669
He wants me to open this and told me not to ask questions.

293
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,000
You asked Chun Poong to open this...

294
00:21:44,139 --> 00:21:46,310
and asked me to get you the security footage.

295
00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:47,438
What are you up to?

296
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:48,609
- He did? - Yes.

297
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:54,449
- Kang Ja. - Chan, you little...

298
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,719
What are you doing? What did you steal?

299
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,780
This.

300
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,560
Where did you get this?

301
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:05,859
This was an anniversary gift to Hansu Group's board members.

302
00:22:06,689 --> 00:22:08,629
- What? - What do you mean?

303
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,230
It's even weirder that you know that, Yoon Sang.

304
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,270
Is your father a board member of Hansu Group?

305
00:22:15,699 --> 00:22:17,399
No, it's not that.

306
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,409
I know a lot of useless facts.

307
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,580
Look at me in the eye and tell me the truth.

308
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,609
What have you been up to?

309
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,550
So...

310
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:32,689
Someone I know got their house broken into.

311
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,249
The thief tried to steal this but dropped it accidentally...

312
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,958
while running away after getting into a scuffle with me.

313
00:22:36,959 --> 00:22:39,589
A scuffle? You mean you physically fought the thief?

314
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,259
Who's that person you know?

315
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,530
Where is that house?

316
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:45,128
Let me access the USB flash drive first.

317
00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:47,698
Does the owner of the USB flash drive know you took it?

318
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,168
I'll tell her after I access it.

319
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:50,299
Why?

320
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,040
Unless we know what's inside,

321
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:54,369
we can't know what the thief was trying to steal...

322
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,379
or how the owner should deal with this incident.

323
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,449
So help me out, Kang Ja.

324
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,750
It's a woman.

325
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,119
The owner of the USB flash drive is a woman.

326
00:23:09,219 --> 00:23:12,189
A woman that Chan likes.

327
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:15,429
And not just any woman,

328
00:23:15,629 --> 00:23:19,270
but a woman that Chan really likes one-sidedly.

329
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,770
Aren't I right?

330
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,500
That makes sense. She's right.

331
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:26,439
Why didn't you say so in the first place?

332
00:23:27,709 --> 00:23:28,740
It's not...

333
00:23:29,139 --> 00:23:31,509
like some intense unrequited love...

334
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,980
Okay, sure.

335
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,948
Let's help him.

336
00:23:34,949 --> 00:23:37,820
He even fought for this love.

337
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,789
You're a real man.

338
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,658
Just help me access the drive.

339
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:45,219
- Okay. Let's help him. - Let's help.

340
00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:51,159
Who's the owner of the USB flash drive? Is it Professor Oh?

341
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,600
Come on. Tell me.

342
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:57,070
I could help, like how I recognized what USB flash drive it was earlier.

343
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,310
- You're right. - So it is Soo Jae?

344
00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:02,010
Soo Jae?

345
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:09,649
Let's get inside first. I'll explain.

346
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,419
- Chun Poong. Switch seats with me. - What?

347
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,589
- Switch seats with me. - Move out of the way?

348
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,589
- Switch seats with me. - Switch seats? Why?

349
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,990
- Be quiet. - Why are we switching seats?

350
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,159
- Quickly. - But...

351
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:28,469
The Supreme Court made a very exciting ruling today, right?

352
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,698
They upheld the original decision...

353
00:24:30,699 --> 00:24:32,199
and sentenced CEO Ko of Serim Group...

354
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:35,409
to three years in prison and four years of probation...

355
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:37,179
Did you know about that case?

356
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,010
- Do you know? - No.

357
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:43,149
How disappointing.

358
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:47,290
You want to be a legal professional but don't even know what's going on.

359
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:48,820
Look it up.

360
00:24:51,889 --> 00:24:54,928
During the first trial, they found CEO Ko was found guilty...

361
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:56,658
of embezzlement and malpractice...

362
00:24:56,659 --> 00:24:57,959
for 70 million of 324.5 million dollars...

363
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,868
and of accounting fraud for 500 million of 2 billion dollars.

364
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:03,570
He was sentenced to six years in prison.

365
00:25:03,699 --> 00:25:05,709
However, the second trial was different.

366
00:25:06,369 --> 00:25:07,369
Right.

367
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:10,809
They found CEO Ko not guilty on the charge of accounting fraud...

368
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,980
involving two billion dollars,

369
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,310
saying it couldn't be proven beyond a reasonable doubt...

370
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:17,379
that CEO Ko colluded with the accountants.

371
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:19,589
He misappropriated two billion dollars.

372
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,849
- Two billion dollars? - That's crazy.

373
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,218
Not guilty even though he misappropriated...

374
00:25:23,219 --> 00:25:24,219
two billion dollars.

375
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,989
What's the key point of this case?

376
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,159
The accountants are key.

377
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,458
CEO Ko insisted that the accountants carried it out...

378
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:32,699
on their own and that he wasn't involved.

379
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,169
Oh, that's why wealthy CEOs use someone else's name...

380
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,438
when they embezzle funds...

381
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:40,069
from their companies.

382
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,868
That way, they can say...

383
00:25:41,869 --> 00:25:44,240
they didn't know anything...

384
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,750
if they ever get caught.

385
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,749
Professor Oh was your tutor?

386
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,448
Don't tell anyone. She said she'd kill me if anyone found out.

387
00:25:53,449 --> 00:25:55,148
- What is another case... - Goodness.

388
00:25:55,149 --> 00:25:56,418
that's similar to this one?

389
00:25:56,419 --> 00:25:58,820
So what happened to Soo Jae last night?

390
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,060
That's right.

391
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:03,799
CEO Seo was sentenced to two years in prison in the first trial,

392
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,229
but his sentence was changed to three years of probation...

393
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,270
in the second trial.

394
00:26:06,469 --> 00:26:09,070
He recently reclaimed his position as CEO.

395
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:10,739
Why was the ruling from the first trial changed?

396
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,368
The subsidiaries that were victims of CEO Seo's actions...

397
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:14,608
submitted a petition stating...

398
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:16,309
that they did not wish for CEO Seo to be punished,

399
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:19,279
and CEO Seo promised that he would repay the money they lost.

400
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,510
And also,

401
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,850
CEO Seo claimed that it was an inevitable choice he made...

402
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:27,019
for the sake of the company, not for personal gain.

403
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,219
This testimony got him three years of probation.

404
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:31,989
I did that.

405
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,290
- Crazy. - You did that, Professor Oh?

406
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:37,129
- So impressive. - My goodness.

407
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,968
Any other cases?

408
00:26:39,969 --> 00:26:43,368
There was a case with CEO Kang of Korea Distribution.

409
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:45,868
He created a shell corporation to evade 200 million dollars in taxes,

410
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:47,539
but he was only sentenced to probation.

411
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:51,878
He was first sentenced to two years in prison, but in the second trial,

412
00:26:51,879 --> 00:26:53,349
he claimed he planned to use the money to rebuild the company.

413
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,750
With this testimony, he got three years of probation.

414
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:58,850
I see that was also your case, Professor Oh.

415
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,119
I guess they call me a dishwasher for a reason.

416
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:04,618
- No wonder. - I knew it.

417
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:07,859
I always tell my clients this when preparing for the first trial.

418
00:27:08,889 --> 00:27:10,030
In the first trial,

419
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:13,369
you'll be taken into custody and given a prison sentence.

420
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,330
This has a strong impact...

421
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:17,899
and makes people think you've been rightfully punished.

422
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:21,509
Then, when people become busy with their lives...

423
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:24,040
and forget about their anger toward you,

424
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,050
I'll get you out on probation in the second trial.

425
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,020
The public only remembers...

426
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:34,790
your first trial.

427
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:42,260
Soo Jae must be looking for this USB flash drive.

428
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,830
I don't think she should know until we figure out what's in here.

429
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,369
It could be dangerous for her if someone finds out about it.

430
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,169
What did I tell you to do just now?

431
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:55,439
Right. So...

432
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:59,649
You were teaching us how to avoid a prison sentence...

433
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:03,820
Sorry.

434
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,550
Get out.

435
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,090
Are we elementary school students or something?

436
00:28:10,219 --> 00:28:11,520
How humiliating.

437
00:28:13,389 --> 00:28:15,189
Hey. Forget about that.

438
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,859
Let's continue our conversation.

439
00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:19,730
What were you saying before? You want me to...

440
00:28:20,629 --> 00:28:22,570
look into something for you?

441
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,239
- Yes. - What?

442
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,939
I have a feeling that the person, who hurt Professor Oh,

443
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,939
is someone that she knows.

444
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,779
Someone who made the USB flash drive,

445
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,409
someone who knows what's on there,

446
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,149
or someone who wants what's on there.

447
00:28:36,219 --> 00:28:38,020
I'm not sure what I can do.

448
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,090
Yoon Sang.

449
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,419
Your father is Choi Tae Guk, Chairman of TK Law Firm.

450
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,189
Your brother is Managing Partner Choi Ju Wan.

451
00:28:49,399 --> 00:28:50,600
You little punk...

452
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:52,570
Gosh, Father.

453
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,169
Come here, you little...

454
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,199
You figured out everything.

455
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,869
Aren't you glad it's me and not someone else?

456
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,939
Darn it. Seriously.

457
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:07,379
Hey. Bring the car.

458
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:17,719
Why did you want to meet President Hong?

459
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,529
Is there something you asked President Hong to do?

460
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,129
Why is that any of your business?

461
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,168
Why do you care what I ask President Hong to do, Mr. Ha?

462
00:29:26,169 --> 00:29:28,169
Chairman Han asked me to look into it.

463
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:34,908
He was yelling as if he got caught doing something bad,

464
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:36,139
just as you expected.

465
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:37,239
(KG Car Service)

466
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,609
That means...

467
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,509
Managing Partner Choi ordered Hong Seok Pal to do something,

468
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,049
but things didn't work out as planned,

469
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:47,219
and he got caught by Chairman Choi, so he started yelling.

470
00:29:47,449 --> 00:29:49,119
- Something like that? - Yes.

471
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:52,560
Did security cameras nearby get anything?

472
00:29:54,629 --> 00:29:56,500
What? They're all broken.

473
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,299
It looks like someone broke them on purpose. What happened?

474
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,468
(Yulseo-ro 2-Gil)

475
00:30:01,469 --> 00:30:02,840
Someone definitely broke them on purpose.

476
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:04,999
I looked into it, and it seems...

477
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,609
some hoodlums went around breaking all of them a few days ago.

478
00:30:09,409 --> 00:30:10,780
I'm sure he got himself prepared.

479
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,209
He's going up against me,

480
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,980
so I'm sure he put in some effort.

481
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,520
Do you really think...

482
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,750
that Managing Partner Choi would order Hong Seok Pal...

483
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:21,990
to do something like that?

484
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,590
I think that's unlikely.

485
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,919
That's kind of low.

486
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,399
Chan. Is your girlfriend pretty?

487
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,938
She's not my girlfriend.

488
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:42,909
"She's not my girlfriend." She's my unrequited love.

489
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:46,949
He's been going back and forth on whether he should message her.

490
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,580
Why? Is he worried she's going to ignore him?

491
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:53,050
You did confess, right?

492
00:30:53,449 --> 00:30:54,749
You two do have a thing, right?

493
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,290
We're not helping someone who's not even aware of your feelings, right?

494
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,929
- No, it's not that. - Hey.

495
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,830
(Professor Oh)

496
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,679
Did you see the license plate or model of the car last night?

497
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:20,750
There was no car. I just saw someone running away...

498
00:31:21,709 --> 00:31:23,719
He may have parked the car somewhere else,

499
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:27,149
or he could have used public transportation on purpose.

500
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,560
Are you trying to find them?

501
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,189
Don't.

502
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:34,888
What?

503
00:31:34,889 --> 00:31:37,060
It could be dangerous. Don't do anything.

504
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,300
If you put yourself in danger and get hurt again...

505
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,010
I beg you...

506
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,040
Please trust me and wait a little.

507
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,409
Hey...

508
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,540
What are you doing here?

509
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,010
I heard that someone broke into your place.

510
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:31,649
Chan has a pretty loud mouth, I see.

511
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,790
It's not that he has a loud mouth...

512
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:38,919
Anyway, he was trying to help you.

513
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,629
That's all you need to know.

514
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:42,959
What do you mean?

515
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,929
From now, call me first...

516
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:49,000
if someone breaks into your place...

517
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:51,439
or Father or Ju Wan makes you angry.

518
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,669
Not anyone else.

519
00:32:55,369 --> 00:32:56,740
Not Gong Chan. Me.

520
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,149
I'll head back.

521
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,350
Hey.

522
00:33:06,889 --> 00:33:08,550
What's up with him?

523
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:37,679
I'm sorry, Father.

524
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,219
I really tried my best...

525
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:44,389
to deal with things...

526
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,859
Why did you get Hong Seok Pal involved?

527
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,500
Why him?

528
00:33:49,629 --> 00:33:52,600
Oh. He said he'd do anything I ask.

529
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:55,600
You told me that you trusted him to do your bidding.

530
00:34:00,209 --> 00:34:01,770
Goodness.

531
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:06,749
I'm personally running around at this age to help Chairman Choi.

532
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,480
I usually have my boys do this kind of work.

533
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:12,179
Go on. Be sure to find it.

534
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,960
I'll meet you here exactly 20 minutes later.

535
00:34:27,869 --> 00:34:32,069
So, where's the USB flash drive?

536
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,339
If you found it,

537
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,810
you should put it in my hands.

538
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:47,389
Go back and get it.

539
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:50,059
Go back and bring it to me.

540
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,119
This little...

541
00:34:51,819 --> 00:34:53,960
A guy came out of nowhere.

542
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,630
What do you want me to do?

543
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,158
Do you think you can tell me what to do...

544
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:00,468
just because you're the chairman's son?

545
00:35:00,469 --> 00:35:01,569
- You... - Hey.

546
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,868
Hey, get out of here.

547
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:05,339
- This little punk... - Where are you going?

548
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,009
- Hey. - Get out of here!

549
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,839
Hey, stop.

550
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,409
Stop, you bastard!

551
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:17,719
You idiot!

552
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:25,159
Do you really think Soo Jae won't be able to figure out who it was?

553
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,799
She's probably figuring it out right now.

554
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,600
You try to pull one over on someone like Soo Jae?

555
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:38,369
You said we needed to get it back no matter what.

556
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,009
So I did it for you, Father.

557
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,580
Sincerely, for you...

558
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,589
This little...

559
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,529
Mr. Ko?

560
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:11,199
You're here.

561
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:15,309
I think you could become a fortune-teller, Ms. Oh.

562
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:18,380
Why? Did you find something? Did you catch the thief?

563
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,080
Here.

564
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,480
So,

565
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,718
look into Han Gi Taek for me.

566
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,089
Han Gi Taek?

567
00:36:29,989 --> 00:36:32,190
Not Hong Seok Pal or Choi Ju Wan?

568
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,989
I think I might've seen something.

569
00:36:39,299 --> 00:36:40,599
Are you okay, sir?

570
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,299
How can you drive so lousily?

571
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,000
I'm so sorry, sir.

572
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:48,109
My mother could pass away any day now.

573
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,940
I got distracted thinking of her...

574
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:52,508
Would it be okay with you if I got this all fixed up...

575
00:36:52,509 --> 00:36:55,479
and returned to you by the end of the day today?

576
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,919
(KG Car Service, Ko Kwang Up)

577
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,179
You run an auto repair shop?

578
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,219
Hey, Jin Young. Bring me the air hose.

579
00:37:01,449 --> 00:37:02,549
- Yes, sir. - Hey.

580
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,830
It was Han Gi Taek, not Hong Seok Pal.

581
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:16,130
That's right. Mr. Choi wouldn't go that far.

582
00:37:20,509 --> 00:37:22,210
He left after he realized the police were there.

583
00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:24,279
But how did you know?

584
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:25,880
Did you see something?

585
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,679
The sneakers.

586
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,798
I thought he might lie low...

587
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:46,429
after getting caught for the 27 million dollars,

588
00:37:46,569 --> 00:37:48,000
but I guess he's just crazy.

589
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,629
That's how people are.

590
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:53,000
They do crazy things when they're backed into a corner.

591
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,210
What are you doing?

592
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:00,610
Who are you?

593
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,679
Han Gi Taek...

594
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:05,549
could've been one step behind.

595
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,659
What is all of this, Chan?

596
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,000
Hey. What is this?

597
00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:25,040
Why are the dollar amounts so high?

598
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,969
They're all over 100,000 dollars.

599
00:38:27,569 --> 00:38:29,339
I think they're corporate accounting records.

600
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,179
Hey. Did you two stay up all night again?

601
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:34,449
- Yes. - Oh, you opened it.

602
00:38:37,179 --> 00:38:38,719
Who is this girl you like?

603
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,889
Why does she have something like this?

604
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:44,190
It's not a girl he likes. It's a professor.

605
00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:45,658
Professor Oh.

606
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:46,759
- What? - What?

607
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,060
Someone broke into Professor Oh's building.

608
00:38:49,589 --> 00:38:50,759
It's by the bar.

609
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:53,670
She called me because I was nearby.

610
00:38:53,969 --> 00:38:56,999
Why didn't you say so in the first place? You could've just said so.

611
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,739
I had to keep her safe.

612
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:02,409
She even turned down a police investigation.

613
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,609
She's worried about people finding out.

614
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,779
If one of us tells someone, it could be dangerous for her.

615
00:39:08,909 --> 00:39:11,719
True. Se Ryeon could easily tell someone.

616
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,250
Hey. Quiet.

617
00:39:14,489 --> 00:39:16,250
Please keep it a secret.

618
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:18,560
Please, Kang Ja.

619
00:39:19,759 --> 00:39:22,028
Make sure the staff don't tell anyone either.

620
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:23,029
Okay.

621
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,460
The thief is someone that Professor Oh knows.

622
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,569
They came knowing this was at her place.

623
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:32,199
Don't worry.

624
00:39:32,799 --> 00:39:34,610
He left his trace on here.

625
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,850
Look at the way he walks. Doesn't it remind you of someone?

626
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,000
- This man... - It's that guy, right?

627
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,880
I know. That's exactly how I looked when I first watched this.

628
00:40:14,949 --> 00:40:17,580
Look. The camera got the other guy too.

629
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,709
The receiver cannot be reached.

(Personal Details Report, Gong Chan)

632
00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:57,759
The caller was Gong Chan, one of the legal clinic students.

633
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:02,089
I was told that he was with Ms. Oh at the hospital that night.

634
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,529

635

Sit.

636
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:11,469
Ju Wan went to Soo Jae's building...

637
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,009
You already know, right?

638
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:17,610
Where's Ju Wan? He's not in the office or answering my calls.

639
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,150
Did he run away somewhere?

640
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:26,619
I sent him to New York.

641
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:29,719
Why?

642
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,520
Because Soo Jae might report Ju Wan to the police?

643
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,029
She would've done so already if she wanted.

644
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,759
Choi Ju Wan, that stupid...

645
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,199
Mind your manners.

646
00:41:39,929 --> 00:41:42,369
How dare you judge your older brother like that.

647
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:45,969
Ju Wan did it for me. To bring me something I want.

648
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,809
He did something you didn't even think to do.

649

Who is...

650

that man, Father?

651

The man that Ju Wan hired...

652
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,489
He didn't just do what he was ordered to.

653
00:42:03,219 --> 00:42:04,790
Soo Jae's going to find out soon.

654
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:08,159
She's going to find out everything.

Did you know who it was all along?

656
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,029
Yes, to some extent.

657
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,600
This man here. It's the same guy.

658
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,270
Do you know who this person is?

659
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,909
I have someone in mind.

660
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:58,279
Who is it?

661
00:42:59,409 --> 00:43:01,548
The owner of the hostess bar where Park So Young worked,

662
00:43:01,549 --> 00:43:02,650
Hong Seok Pal.

663
00:43:04,279 --> 00:43:06,219
He stole Park So Young's phone,

664
00:43:07,219 --> 00:43:09,618
broke into your building, and stole the USB flash drive...

665
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:11,290
to help Choi Ju Wan,

666
00:43:16,259 --> 00:43:18,699
but he dropped it. Hong Seok Pal, I mean.

667
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:24,900
You had this? Since when?

668
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,338
I think he dropped it when we got into a scuffle.

669
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:29,769
But why didn't you say anything?

670
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:32,609
If someone finds out that this is in your hands,

671
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,679
you would have been in danger again.

672
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:37,049
Chun Poong helped us crack the code.

673
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:38,880
And he saved a separate copy.

674
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:46,719
Text me the surveillance footage.

675
00:43:48,029 --> 00:43:49,290
Are you leaving?

676
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,360
Why? Did you think I was going to pat you on the back?

677
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,329
Did you think I was going to thank you...

678
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:57,369
for finding out who the robber was and cracking the code?

679
00:43:58,299 --> 00:44:00,908
I clearly told you not to cross the line.

680
00:44:00,909 --> 00:44:02,440
You even got the entire team involved.

681
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,409
Is my warning a joke to you?

682
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:07,580
Am I a joke to you?

683
00:44:08,009 --> 00:44:09,909
I didn't do it to get compliments from you.

684
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:12,880
I never thought you were a joke.

685
00:44:14,049 --> 00:44:15,850
There was a robber, so I found out who he was.

686
00:44:16,489 --> 00:44:17,489
I was worried about you,

687
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:19,159
so I didn't tell you about the flash drive.

688
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:22,259
I needed to know what was inside to know how to handle this.

689
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:24,699
I only did it because I wanted to help.

690
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:26,929
I was worried.

691
00:44:27,569 --> 00:44:28,929
I was worried sick about you.

692
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,779
Director Han Gi Taek called several times.

693
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,389
He asked to meet with you.

694
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:49,619
That useless fool.

695
00:44:52,819 --> 00:44:54,560
There isn't a thing he can do right.

696
00:45:03,799 --> 00:45:05,369
Don't smile.

697
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,238
I didn't tell you because I knew how you would react.

698
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:10,069
I knew you would make a fuss out of nothing.

699
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,980
How is this nothing?

700
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,909
You were robbed and got hurt.

701
00:45:15,509 --> 00:45:18,678
And Choi Ju Wan was behind the whole thing. How's that nothing?

702
00:45:18,679 --> 00:45:20,549
There are two more.

703
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:25,489
The thug who did the deed under Choi Ju Wan's order.

704
00:45:25,659 --> 00:45:27,730
And Director Han Gi Taek of Hansu Group.

705
00:45:29,529 --> 00:45:31,199
That student who saved you, Gong Chan.

706
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:36,270
I want to bow down and thank that cool, amazing guy.

707
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,569
He's the future of our country. Seriously.

708
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,939
You can't drink all of it. I want some too.

709
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,610
- Shut it. - You're scaring me, quack.

710
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,250
Hey, come on!

711
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:52,520
You're working your head off and are ever so loyal.

712
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,619
But people around you are always targeting you.

713
00:45:56,719 --> 00:45:58,259
You think your chairman doesn't know about it?

714
00:45:58,819 --> 00:46:01,259
You think he wouldn't know what his son did?

715
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:05,330
I bet that old snake knows everything!

716
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,369
- Jun Hee. - What?

717
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,699
You know Gong Chan...

718
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:13,339
Yes, Gong Chan.

719
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:16,239
He's been to the law firm once. And he said something.

720
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,639
He said...

721
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,850
he didn't like...

722
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,250
the people or the firm.

723
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:28,819
He asked me whether...

724
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:31,420
I stayed knowing everything or not.

725
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:33,659
How could I not know?

726
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:36,028
I can practically hear them gossiping about me...

727
00:46:36,029 --> 00:46:37,159
when I turn around.

728
00:46:37,659 --> 00:46:40,699
They are dying to criticize me in any chance they get.

729
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:44,799
And he pointed that out.

730
00:46:49,009 --> 00:46:50,069
Thump.

731
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,610
My heart sank just like that.

732
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,219
And he even figured out who the robber was.

733
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:05,290
On top of that, he cracked the code to the flash drive too.

734
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,159
I'm so furious.

735
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:14,069
He knows too much about me.

736
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,339
He likes you. What's so bad about getting to know you?

737
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,509
Did you want him to look only at your good sides?

738
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,469
That's not possible in life.

739
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:29,909
You know,

740
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,389
when people gossiped about me and criticized me,

741
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,549
I ignored everyone...

742
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:39,889
and tried my best not to show my weak side.

743
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:47,529
Whatever happened, I pretended to be okay and unaffected.

744
00:47:48,469 --> 00:47:51,600
I never showed any tears. And I pretended to be okay.

745
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:53,198
I was so determined...

746
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:54,810
not to let anything get to me, and I endure everything.

747
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:04,819
It always worked.

748
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:07,920
But it won't work on him.

749
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,759
He already found out too much about me.

750
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,830
I think he might find out everything.

751
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:24,839
That's incredibly embarrassing.

752
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:32,409
Too embarrassing that it brings tears to my eyes.

753
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:36,409
Why are you embarrassed about that?

754
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:38,980
You're crazy. There are other things you should be embarrassed about.

755
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,610
(Chairman Choi Tae Guk)

756
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,480
Let's grab a meal, Soo Jae. It's been a while.

757
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:26,499
Yes.

758
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,600
I emailed you the things you requested.

759
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:31,270
Let's meet at a burger place sometime soon.

760
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:34,469
I heard Mr. Choi went to the US.

761
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:36,569
He probably went to the Bahamas.

762
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:40,080
I don't know what you're holding,

763
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,549
but they figured it out too.

764
00:49:42,949 --> 00:49:44,920
That you have it.

765
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,869
Any luck today?

766
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,330
Please sit.

767
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:37,540
I...

768
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:42,639
already ordered the meal you like, Ms. Oh.

769
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,679
You might not realize it, but I've known you for ten years.

770
00:50:48,049 --> 00:50:50,049
I'm here to meet the chairman.

771
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:53,750
I know. Chairman Choi sent me here.

772
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,150
Chairman Choi...

773
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:01,330
wants the flash drive.

774
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,929
You know,

775
00:51:06,259 --> 00:51:09,869
I confidently told him that I would get him the flash drive.

776
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:12,440
When I went, someone else had already taken it.

777
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:16,139
Right. To be precise, it was some people.

778
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:20,980
He even got Hong Seok Pal involved. He should have gotten it at least.

779
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:24,880
Seriously, Choi Ju Wan. He's clumsy at everything.

780
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:27,419
Right?

781
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,549
Interesting.

782
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:31,388
If I knew he would come clean like this,

783
00:51:31,389 --> 00:51:32,489
I wouldn't have kept it quiet.

784
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,588
You couldn't get the flash drive and showed up too late.

785
00:51:36,589 --> 00:51:39,399
I never had any interest in rubbing salt in the wound.

786
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,830
So I didn't pay you any attention.

787
00:51:41,969 --> 00:51:43,869
Maybe, I should have.

788
00:51:47,739 --> 00:51:51,009
If I were you, I wouldn't wear my usual sneakers...

789
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:53,739
when I'm doing something illegal.

790
00:51:55,549 --> 00:51:57,080
Your kids are cute.

791
00:52:00,819 --> 00:52:03,048
Especially the pair you wore in front of the kids...

792
00:52:03,049 --> 00:52:04,060
while pretending to be a good dad.

793
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,290
Your kids must have no idea...

794
00:52:10,929 --> 00:52:12,459
that their father pocketed...

795
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,730
their grandpa's money over the years.

796
00:52:18,569 --> 00:52:20,299
An unmarried Korean woman...

797
00:52:20,469 --> 00:52:22,969
had a baby at a hospital in New York.

798
00:52:23,639 --> 00:52:25,879
And that unmarried woman...

799
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,380
had a thing going on with the son of a giant in the legal world.

800
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,949
Go to the US.

801
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:37,759
People at work will think you're going to a training program.

802
00:52:38,589 --> 00:52:40,460
Why would I go to the US?

803
00:52:42,989 --> 00:52:45,429
You can go there first. Ju Wan will follow you there.

804
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:47,630
Have a baby there...

805
00:52:48,429 --> 00:52:49,929
and have a simple wedding.

806
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:55,738
You two met during the training program,

807
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:57,439
fell in love, and got married.

808
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,580
It's a story everyone will love.

809
00:53:01,009 --> 00:53:04,920
I want my daughter-in-law to be the lead in a lovely story.

810
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,619
When you come back,

811
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:10,420
you can have a proper wedding here.

812
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:14,690
Okay.

813
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:21,929
Wait for me there. I'll go as soon as I wrap things up here.

814
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,920
The chairman is attending his eldest son's wedding.

815
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:48,589
But she had a stillbirth.

816
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:51,658
When the man she thought would come didn't come for her,

817
00:53:51,659 --> 00:53:53,600
she even tried to end her life.

818
00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:56,969
Was it seven years ago?

819
00:53:57,639 --> 00:54:00,838
I heard it from a reporter I knew when I worked in the US branch.

820
00:54:00,839 --> 00:54:03,040
And then I called Chairman Choi.

821
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,810
He told me to silence the reporter,

822
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:09,210
so Mr. Choi's good name wouldn't get dirty.

823
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,319
I spent a fortune on drinks that day.

824
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:16,219
You know, our past...

825
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:19,159
is like a snake in a jar.

826
00:54:19,719 --> 00:54:21,359
No matter how tightly you keep the lid on,

827
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,928
it pops the lid with its head and tries to get out...

828
00:54:22,929 --> 00:54:24,600
whenever there's a chance.

829
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:27,399
At times like that, you must double or triple-layer the lids.

830
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,130
You shouldn't open it to see if the snake is alive...

831
00:54:30,529 --> 00:54:31,699
or not.

832
00:54:32,799 --> 00:54:34,609
Just like the 27 million dollars.

833
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:37,239
What good will exposing the slush fund do?

834
00:54:38,509 --> 00:54:40,409
Let's cover up each other's past.

835
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,650
We ought to help each other in this world.

836
00:54:43,549 --> 00:54:44,949
You should...

837
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,290
give the flash drive to Chairman Choi Tae Guk.

838
00:54:48,589 --> 00:54:50,989
Since when and why...

839
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:54,758
did you start to lie your loyalty with Chairman Choi,

840
00:54:54,759 --> 00:54:56,029
not your uncle, Han Sung Bum?

841
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:00,699
When...

842
00:55:01,929 --> 00:55:03,468
I had to grovel to Han Sung Bum...

843
00:55:03,469 --> 00:55:05,900
despite the fact that he kicked my father out,

844
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:10,469
Chairman Choi saw what I was doing and helped me pocket the money.

845
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,309
How could I have been able to pocket that much money on my own?

846
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:16,310
It's all thanks to him.

847
00:55:17,049 --> 00:55:19,380
I will stay loyal to him for the rest of my life.

848
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:20,889
I...

849
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:23,920
truly trust him.

850
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,658
Trust...

851
00:55:26,659 --> 00:55:29,360
has something to do with one's weakness.

852
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:31,729
You must have confidence...

853
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:33,559
that he won't use your weakness against you...

854
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:34,929
even if you were to show it to him.

855
00:55:36,369 --> 00:55:38,869
Is that what you think of him?

856
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:42,909
Vice versa. Is that what Chairman Choi will think of you?

857
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:46,540
An incompetent man who couldn't even steal the flash drive?

858
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:51,279
The chairman I know won't.

859
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:55,389
Anyway,

860
00:55:57,589 --> 00:55:59,489
the bottom line is...

861
00:56:00,159 --> 00:56:02,630
you and I are both in his shadow.

862
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:05,599
We're on the same side. This doesn't have to be a problem.

863
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:09,170
Why did you take the files? Why did you let this happen to us?

864
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,000
Why?

865
00:56:22,509 --> 00:56:23,610
Did you think...

866
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:26,949
you could take me on?

867
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:31,758
Killing 100 insignificant soldiers on the battlefield is pointless.

868
00:56:31,759 --> 00:56:33,489
You must be able to kill the general.

869
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:37,089
To me,

870
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:40,060
you're one of those insignificant soldiers.

871
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:47,909
Tell the chairman to come.

872
00:56:49,909 --> 00:56:52,739
An entrée must be served after the appetizer.

873
00:57:30,949 --> 00:57:34,080
(Oh Soo Jae)

874
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:35,949
Is that you, Soo Jae?

875
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:41,790
Why did you do that to me?

876
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:45,130
I'm sorry you had a stillbirth.

877
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,770
You told me to come here...

878
00:57:50,369 --> 00:57:52,469
and that he would follow me.

879
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:59,409
And we would have the baby and get married.

880
00:58:00,509 --> 00:58:04,179
Why did you lie to me?

881
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,580
Soo Jae.

882
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,920
People must know their place and be grateful.

883
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:13,659
And you failed at both.

884
00:58:14,489 --> 00:58:16,259
You shouldn't be mad at me about this.

885
00:58:17,429 --> 00:58:18,659
Choose.

886
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:21,630
You can come back and work for me.

887
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:25,699
Or you can stay out there and pick up garbage.

888
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:11,679
A man toyed with a woman and tossed her away.

889
01:00:12,279 --> 01:00:15,350
And the man's father lied to the woman.

890
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:21,190
It's infuriating, but I came back.

891
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:24,719
Yes. I'm glad to have you back.

892
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:26,319
My weakness...

893
01:00:27,929 --> 01:00:29,730
is also yours.

894
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,799
You and I...

895
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:36,299
know each other's weaknesses.

896
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:40,569
Don't forget that.

897
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:55,049
(Managing Partner Choi Tae Guk)

898
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:00,460
I'll help you grow.

899
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:04,190
You never had a taste of success or power.

900
01:01:04,929 --> 01:01:06,199
I will help you taste it.

901
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:12,170
No. I will go higher than that.

902
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:16,069
Until I take over everything.

903
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:21,449
Did you think I didn't know your intention then?

904
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:26,980
I knew you would try to climb up to take over my law firm...

905
01:01:29,219 --> 01:01:31,589
and I would be handling a baby tiger.

906
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,690
I knew it.

907
01:01:33,819 --> 01:01:36,889
But you had no choice because we knew each other's weaknesses.

908
01:01:36,989 --> 01:01:38,259
No.

909
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:40,960
I let it slide.

910
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:44,169
My son was reckless for a night and got you pregnant.

911
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:45,170
And you used the pregnancy...

912
01:01:45,469 --> 01:01:47,540
for your personal gain.

913
01:01:49,409 --> 01:01:50,710
I let that slide.

914
01:01:51,779 --> 01:01:53,810
What do you think of yourself?

915
01:01:55,279 --> 01:01:58,650
I hope you're not fooling yourself to think we're on the same level.

916
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:01,290
Weakness?

917
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:06,920
I don't have any weaknesses.

918
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:08,290
But you do.

919
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,690
And I covered it up for you.

920
01:02:11,699 --> 01:02:14,259
You were powerless and had no one to rely on.

921
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:16,270
I had to cover it up,

922
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:20,299
so I could tame a baby tiger into a docile dog.

923
01:02:21,139 --> 01:02:22,469
I see.

924
01:02:24,009 --> 01:02:27,139
You thought I was a docile dog.

925
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:31,880
That's why you used my name however you saw fit.

926
01:02:42,489 --> 01:02:44,230
Did you know your name is in there?

927
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,259
The file on the USB flash drive.

928
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,429
The paper company in the Bahamas.

929
01:02:51,029 --> 01:02:53,469
Money was laundered through the paper company.

930
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:55,469
And your name is on the bank account.

931
01:02:58,179 --> 01:02:59,310
Oh Soo Jae.

932
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:05,580
Why did you use my name?

933
01:03:06,279 --> 01:03:07,580
The answer is obvious.

934
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:10,520
If there's a problem, I would take the fall.

935
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:12,790
But I took the files.

936
01:03:13,889 --> 01:03:17,059
I bet you wanted to find the files even if you had to use...

937
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:18,460
Han Gi Taek or your son.

938
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:23,429
If this gets out, this bomb will ruin everyone.

939
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:25,569
I bet you wanted to take it back.

940
01:03:25,739 --> 01:03:28,409
Why are you beating around the bush? Tell me what you want.

941
01:03:29,069 --> 01:03:30,270
A fee for using my name.

942
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:35,549
You put my name on this bomb without getting my permission.

943
01:03:37,279 --> 01:03:38,749
You don't want to?

944
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:39,779
Permission?

945
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:44,089
I didn't know I needed your permission.

946
01:03:45,619 --> 01:03:47,719
Fine. What do you want?

947
01:03:48,389 --> 01:03:50,158
You said no to the managing partner title.

948
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:51,330
What do you want?

949
01:03:54,429 --> 01:03:55,600
Seventy million dollars.

950
01:03:57,330 --> 01:03:58,399
What?

951
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,940
Choose.

952
01:04:01,139 --> 01:04:02,968
Do you want me to ruin the big picture...

953
01:04:02,969 --> 01:04:05,080
you've been painting with great effort?

954
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:09,350
Or pay me the fee for the sell-off of Hansu Bio,

955
01:04:10,779 --> 01:04:12,719
seventy million dollars.

956
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:23,429
(Why Her?)

957
01:04:43,509 --> 01:04:45,519
So this deal can't go through without you?

958
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,818
I can't let someone else take what's mine.

959
01:04:47,819 --> 01:04:50,189
You're asking for a crazy deal from me.

960
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:52,460
I should have done it sooner. It's long overdue, isn't it?

961
01:04:52,659 --> 01:04:54,618
She seems so calm after making 70 million dollars.

962
01:04:54,619 --> 01:04:56,059
Actually, I wanted to see you.

963
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:58,359
There's something I didn't tell you.

964
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:59,559
Soo Jae. Do you like Chan?

965
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,400
Who is that kid, Gong Chan?

966
01:05:01,469 --> 01:05:02,928
Just live quietly as Gong Chan.

967
01:05:02,929 --> 01:05:04,739
Isn't that how you can fool your professor too?

968
01:05:05,369 --> 01:05:06,639
Don't you know who I am?

969
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:08,769
Where are you? Something is up, right?

970
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:11,270
Park So Young. What if I killed Park So Young?
