Oh, where's my phone?

00:03:34,971 --> 00:03:37,470

Yet you still wish to push ahead with the plan.

48
00:04:07,971 --> 00:04:10,170
Do you want them to all give up on life and die?

49

Good grief, those destitute peasants.

50
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:14,509
Not owning a home isn't something to brag about.

51
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:18,151
- What? - How could you say such a thing?

52
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,521
Your microphone.

53
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:21,890
What did you say just now?

54
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:24,520
Did you call our citizens "destitute peasants"?

55
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,959
Assemblyman Lee In Soo. You want to run for President.

56
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,829
How dare you call our citizens "destitute peasants"?

57
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,260
No, I was talking to myself while thinking about something else.

58
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,671
You can't feign ignorance and say you were distracted.

No one will buy it.

60
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,899
You must bow down and apologize.

61
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,210
Goodness gracious.

62
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,710
Hey, I was just mumbling to myself.

63
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:49,851
I had reported him for accepting illegal political contributions,

64
00:04:49,911 --> 00:04:51,751
but the prosecution completely ignored it.

He wishes to run for President...

68
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,629
but dared to refer to citizens as "destitute peasants".

69
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,089
- We must stop him! - What is this?

70
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,361
- And Yeongpyeong District too. - I'm sorry, sir. I'll look into it.

71
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,371
Ms. Oh.

72
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,541
Then what should I do?

73
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,440
What's the biggest weakness we can use...

74
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:16,741
against someone fighting for justice?

75
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,911
Being called "destitute peasants" is like our golden ticket.

76
00:05:22,411 --> 00:05:25,449
I'll make him give me an apartment and a commercial building.

77
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,691
Once he gives me those, I shall cast my vote for him.

78
00:05:32,161 --> 00:05:34,421
Their not-so-righteous intentions being exposed.

79
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,061
We sent him the recording, so I'm sure he got the message.

80
00:05:37,731 --> 00:05:40,661
I suggest you bow down, apologize, and end it on a high note.

86

They were shouting hurray together hand in hand...

Whatever. Why envy her when all she does is clean up everyone's mess?

88

The managing partner title is mine anyway!

89
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:10,830
Are you sure you'll be promoted to managing partner?

90
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,630
Yes, I'm 99.9 percent sure! Tell the kids.

91
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,900
Go ahead and tell your father too...

92
00:06:16,871 --> 00:06:18,001
Gosh, I'm getting goosebumps.

93
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,009
Oh Soo Jae is at it again. She's chewing out the associates.

the false emissions data, will testify for the plaintiff.

97
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,981
What can we do to invalidate Cho Moon Yong's testimony?

98
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,750
We must stop him no matter what.

99
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:37,790
"No matter what"? How?

100
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,820
Of course, not by force. We'll talk him out of it.

101
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,491
We should meet him and persuade him in person.

102
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,160
I'll try to persuade him.

103
00:06:45,161 --> 00:06:46,860
I'll find out what he needs.

104
00:06:46,861 --> 00:06:49,230
"Have you ever seen things work out for a whistle blower in the end?"

105

"You have a family to feed. Decide wisely."

107
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,410
We'll pressure him while we...

108
00:06:55,411 --> 00:06:57,171
You're out too. Get out.

109
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,740
If I'm wrong, please tell me exactly what I got wrong.

(2nd trial for the Hansu Bio Chemical-Industrial Complex case)

113
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,291
Counsel, you may cross-examine the witness.

114
00:07:12,691 --> 00:07:15,590
Your Honour. Before that,

115
00:07:15,661 --> 00:07:18,760
please allow me to reveal the truth about Mr. Cho Moon Yong,

116
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:21,970
the witness who first reported on Hansu Bio's...

117
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:24,470
allegedly falsified air pollutant emissions data.

118
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:49,291
Now that you've seen the photo, please think about this.

119
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,900
Mr. Cho received money from the plaintiff.

120
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:56,731
Could we say his intentions behind the testimony are righteous?

121
00:07:58,171 --> 00:08:01,941
He stated that the company falsified its emissions data.

122
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,940
But could we trust him?

123
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:06,311
It's true!

124
00:08:06,811 --> 00:08:10,251
It really is true! Please believe me.

125
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,621
This is a trap.

126
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,450
This is a trap!

127
00:08:14,551 --> 00:08:17,250
They're trying to sabotage me! This is a trap.

128
00:08:17,251 --> 00:08:20,490
This is a trap! Let go of me!

129
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:22,029
We will take a brief recess.

130
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,931
This is a trap!

131

(Plaintiff)

132
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,830
What are you doing?

133
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:33,601
I told you that it'd be hard for you to win the second trial.

134
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:35,170
(Court in Session)

135
00:08:35,171 --> 00:08:37,411
While preparing for this trial,

136
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:41,510
we focused on finding out why Yang Ji Ho fell ill...

137
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:43,151
and conducted in-depth research and experiments.

138
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,319
We collected data from other areas too,

139
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,119
not just the vicinity of the factory.

140
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,391
And as you can see,

141
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:54,191
similar levels of pollutants were detected in other areas too.

142
00:08:54,561 --> 00:08:56,690
This shows that the emissions...

143
00:08:56,691 --> 00:08:59,431
from Hansu Bio Chemical-Industrial Complex...

144
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:02,330
had nothing to do with Yang Ji Ho's illness.

145
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,730
No, Your Honour!

146
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,500
My son, Ji Ho,

147
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,240
fell ill because of his poor, incompetent parents.

148
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,340
He inhaled black dust even when he was in my womb.

149
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,311
Your Honour.

150
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:16,710
Please help my son, Ji Ho.

151
00:09:16,881 --> 00:09:20,850
Please help my child, Your Honour.

152
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:24,250
Please help them, Your Honour.

153
00:09:31,661 --> 00:09:32,730
Thank you!

154
00:09:34,431 --> 00:09:37,631
This child is suffering from a lung disease similar to pneumoconiosis...

155
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,911
because of the pollutants from Hansu Bio Chemical-Industrial Complex.

156
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,271
Air pollutants...

157
00:09:44,781 --> 00:09:47,740
that can cause lung diseases and various types of cancer...

158
00:09:48,681 --> 00:09:50,810
caused this little boy to develop a pulmonary disease...

159
00:09:50,811 --> 00:09:52,520
and have been threatening the health of the residents.

160
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:54,350
(Plaintiff)

161
00:10:03,131 --> 00:10:06,161
Ji Ho's doctor, Mr. Shin Do Hyung, concluded that...

162
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:08,369
environmental factors were the main culprit...

163
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,830
behind Ji Ho's condition, which is similar to pneumoconiosis.

164
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,870
Other doctors at the hospital have stated the same.

165
00:10:14,671 --> 00:10:16,311
Ji Ho is still a kid.

166
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,180
Do you think it's fair that he has to go through all this pain...

167
00:10:20,181 --> 00:10:23,051
and get tested on an ongoing basis due to such environmental factors?

168
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:28,391
Your Honour. I just received a medical certificate.

169
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,490
I'd like to read it aloud and submit it as evidence.

170
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,061
Your Honour.

171
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:36,730
Counsel is trying to cloud the issue.

172
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,931
I have no reason to stop her as she hasn't given her closing statement.

173
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,500
Please go ahead.

174
00:10:43,631 --> 00:10:46,900
"The suggested correlation between Yang Ji Ho's condition..."

175
00:10:46,901 --> 00:10:50,271
"and emissions from Hansu Bio Chemical-Industrial Complex..."

176
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,110
"cannot be proved."

177
00:10:54,411 --> 00:10:55,551
Your Honour.

178
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,249
Please check who issued such a medical certificate...

179
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,250
and how it was done.

180
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:00,719
We must find out.

181
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,250
There is no need to check.

182
00:11:03,151 --> 00:11:06,791
This was issued by Dr. Shin Do Hyung, Ji Ho's doctor.

183
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:13,300
I've also enclosed the opinions of the pulmonologists...

184
00:11:13,301 --> 00:11:15,730
at the hospital where Dr. Shin Do Hyung works.

185
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,710
(Judge)

186
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,441
Your Honour.

187
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:29,311
I must tell you something very important about Ji Ho.

188
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,950
Your Honour.

189
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,220
Please have the security guards escort him out for a moment,

190
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:41,590
and I ask that you make a closed court order.

191
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,261
You can't do that.

192
00:11:43,891 --> 00:11:46,761
Just say it in front of everyone! Why must Ji Ho leave?

193
00:11:47,061 --> 00:11:50,000
You cannot suddenly make a closed court order.

194
00:11:50,531 --> 00:11:51,901
Please proceed as is.

195
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,270
I gave you a chance.

196
00:11:56,271 --> 00:11:58,041
A chance for what?

197
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:04,011
Ji Ho was adopted when he was five.

198
00:12:04,381 --> 00:12:06,719
- What? - He was adopted?

199
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,550
- For real? - What is going on?

200
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:11,619
Their claim that Ji Ho was inhaling pollutants...

201
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,921
even in his mother's womb...

202
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:14,720
is all a lie, Your Honour.

203
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,560
- Seriously? - Is this really true?

204
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:19,060
- I can't believe this. - This is insane.

205
00:12:19,061 --> 00:12:21,600
- He was adopted? - What is going on?

206
00:12:23,031 --> 00:12:25,270
Your Honour, may we have a short recess?

207
00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:28,271
Forget a recess. I suggest you give up on this trial.

208
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:32,141
We have witness statements that say they have been abusing Ji Ho...

209
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,180
and that they have generated profit in the process...

210
00:12:35,181 --> 00:12:37,911
of adopting a number of children and giving them up.

211
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,681
It's all a lie.

212
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,350
Ji Ho is our son.

213
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,590
Ji Ho is our son!

214
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,089
And we don't abuse him. We never once abused him!

215
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,760
This must be backed by objective evidence.

216
00:12:50,761 --> 00:12:52,700
I have evidence right here.

217
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,100
It's fake. It's all made up!

218
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,531
Order!

219
00:12:57,771 --> 00:12:59,239
(Plaintiff)

220
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,171
(Judge)

221
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,510
(DNA Test Report)

222
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:09,350
(A and B are not biologically related.)

223
00:13:09,551 --> 00:13:11,011
You ran a paternity test?

224
00:13:12,021 --> 00:13:14,350
It's against the law to do this without our consent.

225
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,220
Which is why I won't be submitting this.

226
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:19,691
But there's plenty of other evidence.

227
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,870
This is all your fault.

228
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,671
You ruined everything!

229
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,969
I should've abandoned you long ago.

230
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,670
You can't even earn your keep.

231
00:13:36,671 --> 00:13:39,480
What will you do now? What will you do about this?

232
00:13:40,941 --> 00:13:43,449
- My goodness. - Let the boy go!

233
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,250
- I can't believe this. - What is going on?

234
00:13:53,891 --> 00:13:55,160
Since Yang Ji Ho...

235
00:13:55,161 --> 00:13:58,031
was not born and raised near the factory,

236
00:13:58,191 --> 00:14:01,360
we cannot conclude that his lung condition was caused...

237
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,600
by the emissions from Hansu Bio Chemical-Industrial Complex.

238
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:07,140
Ergo, the court hereby announces that the initial verdict...

239
00:14:07,141 --> 00:14:09,511
concerning Yang Ji Ho has been revoked...

240
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:12,181
and that his request has been denied.

241
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,310
Don't you think you owe Ji Ho an apology?

242
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,151
- Don't you feel responsible? - Don't you feel bad?

243
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,381
Do you not think you violated Ji Ho's rights?

244
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,391
Let's go, ma'am.

245
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,020
- Wait! - Just a comment, please.

246
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:28,089
- One moment! - Please say a few words!

247
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,229
- By the way, - Just one comment!

248
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,860
how did you know that Ji Ho was adopted?

249
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,560
Didn't you notice anything strange...

250
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:36,031
while going over the family relation certificate?

251
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,171
First.

252
00:14:38,401 --> 00:14:41,811
The other two kids share "Ye" in their names, but Ji Ho doesn't.

253
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,141
Second.

254
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:47,880
He was born only 11 months after Yang Ye Seo was born.

255
00:14:47,881 --> 00:14:49,151
They're not even a year apart.

256
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:54,051
How come I'm the only one who notices these things?

257
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,890
But how did you know that Cho Moon Yong would accept a bribe?

258
00:14:57,891 --> 00:15:00,460
Who knew a whistle blower would take a bribe?

259
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,391
Because of his attitude.

260
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,791
It's all about the attitude.

261
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:08,330
To tell you the truth, I knew this would happen.

262
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,271
Those with questionable intentions always have a suspicious attitude.

263
00:15:13,401 --> 00:15:15,511
I made sure Yang Jung Tae would hear...

264
00:15:16,271 --> 00:15:19,281
that bribing Cho Moon Yong would make things easier in the courtroom.

265
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,651
The two men with unsavoury intentions blew themselves up together.

266
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,479
But things like attitudes and intentions...

267
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,080
You could tell because it was you.

268
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,551
We're associates, not fortune-tellers.

269
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,890
If there's a witness that puts you at a disadvantage,

270
00:15:31,891 --> 00:15:33,420
make them lose their credibility.

271
00:15:33,421 --> 00:15:37,061
If it's the trial itself, make sure it never takes place.

272
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,531
That's what it's all about.

273
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,200
If you still don't get it after watching the trial,

274
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,401
find yourself a different job.

275
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:01,891
The award ceremony is tomorrow, right?

276
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:05,090
What do you say? Should I show up with flowers and my kids?

277
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,360
Forget it. Even just thinking about it makes me cringe.

278
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:11,560
Can you smile a little when you're getting photos taken this time?

279
00:16:11,561 --> 00:16:14,061
You kept a straight face the last time you received an award.

280
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,969
Tell Auntie Soo Jae to smile!

281
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,570
- Smile, Auntie Soo Jae! - Smile, Auntie Soo Jae!

282
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,770
Congratulate Auntie Soo Jae on the award.

283
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:24,010
- Congratulations, Auntie Soo Jae! - Goodness. You're so loud.

284
00:16:24,011 --> 00:16:25,411
- Nice job. - Bye.

285
00:16:46,801 --> 00:16:48,800
(Lawyer of the Year, Oh Soo Jae of TK Law Firm)

286
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:50,100
Did you see that yesterday?

287
00:16:50,671 --> 00:16:53,170
- Congratulations. - Congratulations!

288
00:16:53,171 --> 00:16:54,301
Congratulations!

289
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,441
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

290
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,609
- Congratulations, Ms. Oh. - Congratulations!

291
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,441
- You're so cool. - She won't even smile.

292
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,750
She never smiles.

293
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,620
Goodness. Someone's really lucky.

294
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:09,050
When she first joined the firm, she was a clueless loser.

295
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,020
No one even wanted to talk to her.

296
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:18,931
Hey.

297
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,671
Get out.

298
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,530
You remember, right?

299
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,841
Back then, she couldn't even dare to look at us.

300
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,810
- How about sushi? - Let's just go for jjajangmyeon.

301
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,081
Hello.

302
00:17:33,581 --> 00:17:36,380
- Come on. Let's go. - I know of a good restaurant.

303
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:38,309
- Why don't we go there? - Let's go.

304
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,120
- Come on. - I know of a good place too.

305
00:17:40,121 --> 00:17:41,681
- Nice. - Let's go.

306
00:17:45,321 --> 00:17:48,160
When she was an associate, I didn't even eat with her.

307
00:17:48,161 --> 00:17:50,230
I mean, why would I? She'd just ruin my appetite.

308
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:53,059
Will we let her be promoted to managing partner and call her ma'am?

309
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,401
No, we absolutely can't let that happen.

310
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,871
According to our new policy, your opinion is worth 40 percent.

311
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,809
The associates and partner lawyers' opinions, 40 percent.

312
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,440
And mine, 20 percent. We'll tally them all up...

313
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:06,280
and appoint our managing partner.

314
00:18:06,611 --> 00:18:08,239
That report tells you what the associates...

315
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,479
and partner lawyers think.

316
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,380
You can do as you please.

317
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,950
You don't have to ask the employees for their opinions.

318
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,820
Pretending to listen to employee opinions...

319
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:17,851
is the latest trend among all the top-notch law firms.

320
00:18:18,351 --> 00:18:20,460
We must not fall behind the trends, you know?

321
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,631
In any case, we're rooting for Mr. Min Young Bae.

322
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,799
Look at the top ten law firms in the country.

323
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,500
There's no female managing partner.

324
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,600
And she didn't even go to college. My goodness.

325
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:33,840
She comes from nothing and didn't even go to college,

326
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:35,809
yet you helped her come this far.

327
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,810
That, in and of itself, makes you a trendsetter.

328
00:18:39,141 --> 00:18:41,181
Soo Jae has been doing a great job.

329
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:44,910
I heard Song Mi Rim was like Ms. Oh's chief assistant.

330
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:47,681
Why should we interview her?

331
00:18:47,921 --> 00:18:50,150
I wanted to interview the final candidates' chief assistants...

332
00:18:50,151 --> 00:18:52,591
and hear their honest opinions.

333
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:53,990
I see.

334
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,530
Well...

335
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,300
In this day and age, people are moved by stuff like that.

336
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,370
That's true. This top-notch advisory board that consists of...

337
00:19:04,371 --> 00:19:06,401
former high-ranking officials such as police commissioner,

338
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,911
national director of Tax Services, director of Customs Service,

339
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:11,670
chief justice, secretary-general of the National Assembly,

340
00:19:11,671 --> 00:19:13,740
and even former ministers...

341
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,279
are gathered together to listen to mere employees' opinions.

342
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,821
This should be in the newspapers.

343
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,621
Song Mi Rim? I've already won her over.

344
00:19:26,821 --> 00:19:29,529
She's very ambitious.

345
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,959
Think about it. She's an associate, but she's like Soo Jae's secretary.

346
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,830
That's why everyone calls her "Little Oh Soo Jae".

347
00:19:35,831 --> 00:19:37,529
Which is why I cut a deal with her.

348
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,499
"Support me and come work for me."

349
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,499
"Then I'll help you make partner."

350
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,539
What?

351
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,640
Make partner after just five years? Don't go overboard.

352
00:19:45,641 --> 00:19:47,809
Come on. You know how it goes.

353
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,610
I just had to win her over!

354
00:19:49,611 --> 00:19:51,480
It doesn't mean I'll actually help her.

355
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:54,019
So? Who's buying dinner today?

356
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,789
Last year, Ms. Oh pulled in 32 million dollars,

357
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,520
whereas Mr. Min pulled in eight million dollars.

358
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,989
Ms. Oh's total revenue was a lot higher.

359
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,530
We're aware. We know that,

360
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:06,300
but that's not the only thing we should consider.

361
00:20:06,601 --> 00:20:10,500
So I'd like to carefully bring up my next point.

362
00:20:11,431 --> 00:20:15,071
While working under Ms. Oh for the past five years, I learned...

363
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,710
that not every partner lawyer is a leader.

364
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,509
There are 38 partner lawyers and 62 associates.

365
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,980
The firm has over 100 employees.

366
00:20:24,881 --> 00:20:28,081
The managing partner must possess excellent leadership skills.

367
00:20:28,381 --> 00:20:30,921
I believe that character matters more than performance.

368
00:20:31,151 --> 00:20:33,559
So who do you think should be promoted to managing partner?

369
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,230
Ms. Oh, of course. Right?

370
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:40,260
Are you rooting for Mr. Min Young Bae?

371
00:20:40,431 --> 00:20:42,700
As they say, an arm naturally bends inward.

372
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,700
I'm sure she's rooting for Ms. Oh.

373
00:20:44,831 --> 00:20:49,171
The thing is, your arm doesn't only bend inward.

374
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,280
It can bend outward too, like this.

375
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,170
Congratulations on the award.

376
00:21:17,171 --> 00:21:20,000
Everyone's jealous, but I mean it. You know that, right?

377
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:26,240
I heard you impressed the higher-ups.

378
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:33,050
Among the three companies that want to acquire Hansu Bio,

379
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,950
SP Partners has made the most aggressive offer.

380
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,391
The price they suggested is on par with what the other two offered,

381
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,160
but they're willing to offer royalties...

382
00:21:41,161 --> 00:21:43,530
on the use of the Hansu brand.

383
00:21:43,931 --> 00:21:47,199
My uncle is keeping a keen eye on SP Partners as well.

384
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,730
I have to say, I truly envy Director Han.

385
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:53,699
His uncle is the chairman of Hansu Group.

386
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,970
He's set for life. His job is more secure than civil service jobs.

387
00:21:57,911 --> 00:21:59,081
Director Han.

388
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:02,411
What's the number one rule you must follow to keep your secure job?

389
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:04,510
Make safe choices.

390
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:07,120
Sure, Yoon Se Pil of SP Partners is a very successful CEO.

391
00:22:07,121 --> 00:22:08,949
But the company grew too quickly.

392
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,351
What does that mean?

393
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,559
There's a higher risk.

394
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,861
Right, of course.

395
00:22:16,161 --> 00:22:18,960
That's why we'll trust your choice.

396
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,431
The three of us need to discuss some things in private.

397
00:22:23,601 --> 00:22:26,239
Yes, the bosses need to have a quick chat.

398
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,739
I love stuff like this.

399
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,910
Get back to work. Go.

400
00:22:29,911 --> 00:22:31,641
Work hard. Your time will come.

401
00:22:41,351 --> 00:22:44,220
You know, the judge for the appeal hearing.

402
00:22:45,151 --> 00:22:48,190
I'd like to give him a little gift.

403
00:22:48,191 --> 00:22:50,230
His son is graduating from college this year.

404
00:22:51,131 --> 00:22:53,260
Oh, that's perfect.

405
00:22:53,361 --> 00:22:55,499
We'll create a position for him at Hansu.

406
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,330
With the recent hiring scandals,

407
00:22:57,331 --> 00:22:59,170
I suggest you give it some time.

408
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:01,370
I can't even show my gratitude?

409
00:23:01,371 --> 00:23:03,170
Come on. What's the world coming to?

410
00:23:03,171 --> 00:23:05,469
In this day and age, I can't even hire an aide...

411
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,509
whenever I want to.

412
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,911
Oh, boy.

413
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,111
I must say, fortune-teller Kim is very accurate.

414
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:14,351
Kim said you'd make big money this year...

415
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,520
and that you, Assemblyman Lee, would move up the ladder.

416
00:23:17,691 --> 00:23:19,361
If all goes well with Yeongpyeong District...

417
00:23:19,661 --> 00:23:21,591
and the sale of Hansu Bio,

418
00:23:23,161 --> 00:23:25,901
all our hard work in the past ten years will come to fruition.

419
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,229
Yes. What we've been planning for the past ten years...

420
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:31,030
will finally come true. Dreams do come true!

421
00:23:32,671 --> 00:23:33,700
Oh, right.

422
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,171
Will Min Young Bae be promoted to managing partner?

423
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,309
Yes, that's the plan.

424
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:43,010
Good. Young Bae is an easy one to handle.

425
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,220
Oh Soo Jae is the perfect one to put to work.

426
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,651
(Oh Soo Jae)

427
00:23:50,151 --> 00:23:52,020
Excuse me. I have to take this call.

428
00:23:57,091 --> 00:23:58,391
Hi, it's me.

429
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,131
It looks like you've been having a lot of fun these days.

430
00:24:03,931 --> 00:24:07,170
You took a bribe from Naeun Group using a golf wager as an excuse.

431
00:24:07,171 --> 00:24:09,469
Then you partied it up with people from H and T Korea.

432
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,171
They paid for everything, of course.

433
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:13,310
You've been keeping very busy, Young Bae.

434
00:24:14,181 --> 00:24:16,681
What? Hey, Soo Jae.

435
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,980
What's all this?

436
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:23,550
This was a strategic move. I met them to get Intel from them.

437
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,019
Come on. You know the drill.

438
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,260
Take your hands off this quietly.

439
00:24:28,591 --> 00:24:30,831
I'll tell everyone that you're too busy to work on it.

440
00:24:32,131 --> 00:24:34,631
- What? - I told everyone to leave...

441
00:24:35,101 --> 00:24:37,331
because I wanted to save your face.

442
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:41,371
Have you not heard the rumours?

443
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:43,709
Maybe you've been too excited about the award.

444
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:47,580
I'll be promoted to managing partner. It's almost a done deal.

445
00:24:47,581 --> 00:24:49,950
Even your assistant Song Mi Rim is rooting for me.

446
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,750
Sir, is it true that Young Bae is getting the position?

447
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,360
It's not decided yet.

448
00:24:59,361 --> 00:25:00,691
You little...

449
00:25:01,121 --> 00:25:04,591
The sale of Hansu Bio. Let me handle it on my own.

450
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,831
All right.

451
00:25:09,331 --> 00:25:11,230
(Chairman Choi Tae Guk)

452
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:13,469
How dare you do a background check on me?

453
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,300
What are you, a bully?

454
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,039
Aren't you the one who lied to my associate...

455
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,580
that you'd help her make partner?

456
00:25:22,581 --> 00:25:24,181
That makes you a bully.

457
00:25:25,381 --> 00:25:27,681
Song Mi Rim, that little...

458
00:25:29,091 --> 00:25:30,520
Now, that's your cue to leave the room.

459
00:25:31,851 --> 00:25:32,990
We need to have a meeting.

460
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,060
- Where is Song Mi Rim? - Yes?

461
00:25:36,361 --> 00:25:38,391
Hey, what's your problem?

462
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:41,931
Come in.

463
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,101
Come on in, please.

464
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,740
Darn it!

465
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,141
What are you looking at?

466
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,450
I apologize on his behalf. None of this should've happened.

467
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,280
Don't worry. I'm a little flustered, but it's fine.

468
00:26:03,651 --> 00:26:04,990
- Shall we continue? - Yes.

469
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:06,891
By the way,

470
00:26:07,421 --> 00:26:09,861
you're aware that we're missing a lot of documents, right?

471
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,200
I told you that you must send us everything.

472
00:26:13,331 --> 00:26:14,830
I believe I reminded you a bunch of times.

473
00:26:14,831 --> 00:26:16,700
Right, you did.

474
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,101
We'll check again.

475
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,740
- Look into it. - Yes, sir.

476
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,141
We'll stop by soon to pick them up if you're okay with it.

477
00:26:25,341 --> 00:26:27,381
Well, sure.

478
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:29,450
Great.

479
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,821
Go!

480
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:41,160
- Hey, hurry. - Okay.

481
00:26:41,161 --> 00:26:43,190
Let's get this done quickly.

482
00:26:43,191 --> 00:26:44,290
All right.

483
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,691
Please stop.

484
00:26:48,101 --> 00:26:49,571
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

485
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,841
I said, stop.

486
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,310
What?

487
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,081
Are you the one who sent the people who are at our office now?

488
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:10,651
Did you send them already?

489
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,290
You said "soon".

490
00:27:16,661 --> 00:27:17,661
Let's go.

491
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,371
Hey! What were the security guards doing?

492
00:27:25,671 --> 00:27:27,040
How could you let them take everything?

493
00:27:33,581 --> 00:27:37,411
I've never seen Director Han Ki Taek get so worked up.

494
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,621
I suppose there are lots of things that he wants to hide.

495
00:27:42,421 --> 00:27:44,820
Breach of duty and embezzlement, which isn't even news.

496
00:27:44,821 --> 00:27:46,421
I'm sure he has quite a record.

497
00:27:46,691 --> 00:27:49,960
Oh Soo Jae, that crazy witch. How dare she raid my company?

498
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,131
What exactly did she take?

499
00:27:54,361 --> 00:27:55,431
What about the cruise?

500
00:27:56,371 --> 00:27:57,700
That too?

501
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:02,141
You idiot! Do you want to get kicked out like your father did?

502
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:06,010
Go retrieve everything she took!

503
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,341
Now!

504
00:28:10,151 --> 00:28:11,381
So what will you do?

505
00:28:11,611 --> 00:28:12,651
Sir.

506
00:28:13,121 --> 00:28:16,120
Everything Soo Jae has is in the palm of my hand.

507
00:28:16,121 --> 00:28:17,421
You need not worry, sir.

508
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,921
Darn it!

509
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,361
You know, the cruise... We have to be extremely careful.

510
00:28:26,161 --> 00:28:27,600
If that gets out...

511
00:28:27,601 --> 00:28:29,299
You don't need to worry.

512
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,970
Ki Taek, that moron.

513
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:34,770
Oh, dear.

514
00:28:36,111 --> 00:28:39,641
I will promote Soo Jae to managing partner.

515
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,410
What are you talking about? You should fire her at once!

516
00:28:42,411 --> 00:28:44,910
She's too useful to be let go.

517
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:47,450
A loyal dog that wags her tail no matter what you throw at her.

518
00:28:47,651 --> 00:28:50,091
I don't want to get rid of her just because she acted up once,

519
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,020
because it'd be such a shame.

520
00:29:16,681 --> 00:29:20,121
(Mom)

521
00:29:43,171 --> 00:29:46,180
- My gosh. - Is this real?

522
00:29:46,181 --> 00:29:48,640
- What? - For real?

523
00:29:48,641 --> 00:29:51,510
- Is this really happening? - This isn't a prank, is it?

524
00:29:52,851 --> 00:29:55,151
- Is this really true? - This makes no sense.

525
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,591
My gosh! Yes!

526
00:30:04,191 --> 00:30:07,361
Yes, Oh Soo Jae! She stole that position from me!

527
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,769
Chairman Choi promoted her instead of me.

528
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:13,500
(Oh Soo Jae has been appointed TK Law Firm's managing partner.)

529
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,881
(General Meeting of the Women Lawyers Association)

530
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,650
(Choongin Law Firm, TK Law Firm)

531
00:30:26,651 --> 00:30:28,381
You heard about Oh Soo Jae, right?

532
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,289
Managing partner, seriously?

533
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:32,450
Lawyer Min Young Bae was supposed to get the title,

534
00:30:32,651 --> 00:30:34,259
but Chairman Choi suddenly changed his mind.

535
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,460
She raided Hansu Group to get her hands on all their documents.

536
00:30:36,861 --> 00:30:38,459
That's why Chairman Choi changed his decision.

537
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,059
She's got some nerve.

538
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,999
How could she do that when Hansu is her client?

539
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,500
She scares me.

540
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,470
There she is.

541
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:49,141
Look at her smiling. I can't stand her.

542
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,411
- My gosh. - How have you been?

543
00:30:54,341 --> 00:30:57,780
Congratulations, Ms. Oh. You really broke the glass ceiling.

544
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,480
I'm so proud of you.

545
00:30:59,881 --> 00:31:01,650
I owe it all to you, ma'am.

546
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,091
Congratulations, Ms. Oh.

547
00:31:03,321 --> 00:31:04,590
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

548
00:31:04,591 --> 00:31:07,259
I'm so jealous. You're already a managing partner.

549
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,360
You know, Serin Group's case my firm is currently working on.

550
00:31:09,361 --> 00:31:11,490
We want more attorneys on the case.

551
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:14,830
Can TK help us?

552
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,170
I'll speak with Chairman Choi.

553
00:31:17,171 --> 00:31:19,100
I can certainly take care of that.

554
00:31:19,101 --> 00:31:20,171
Great.

555
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,371
Soo Jae.

556
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,410
Congratulations.

557
00:31:26,411 --> 00:31:30,210
Young Bae thought he'd be the one getting the promotion.

558
00:31:30,581 --> 00:31:33,049
But don't you think it was too mean to kick him out...

559
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:35,151
of the Hansu Bio case like that?

560
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,060
Are you two back together now?

561
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,759
You're no longer separated?

562
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,259
Hey, we were never separated.

563
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,901
Where did you hear such a groundless rumour?

564
00:31:49,101 --> 00:31:51,930
My gosh, ma'am! How have you been?

565
00:31:51,931 --> 00:31:55,070
- You made it. - Yes. You look great.

566
00:31:55,071 --> 00:31:56,871
Hello.

567
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:09,950
Congratulations, Ms. Oh.

568
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:19,260
I'm looking forward to the sale of Hansu Bio.

569
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,230
SP Partners CEO, Mr. Yoon Se Pil.

570
00:32:25,431 --> 00:32:27,671
A meeting like this is unnecessary in the middle of a deal like this.

571
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,671
And you know it can cause misunderstanding.

572
00:32:31,141 --> 00:32:33,540
Did you get the position you wanted...

573
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,081
by becoming the managing partner at TK Law Firm?

574
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,720
The case decided in favour of Min Young Bae was overturned.

575
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:47,161
This means that the information you have was an effective weapon.

576
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,121
Should I...

577
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,591
give you a little tip?

578
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,371
That information...

579
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,371
includes something beyond your imagination.

580
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,770
Make sure to find it.

581
00:33:12,611 --> 00:33:15,250
(CEO Yoon Se Pil, SP Partners)

582
00:33:26,661 --> 00:33:28,529
- Congratulations. - Ms. Oh, congratulations.

583
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:31,071
- Ms. Oh, congratulations. - Congratulations.

584
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:32,300
Congratulations.

585
00:33:33,441 --> 00:33:34,540
Congratulations.

586
00:33:39,911 --> 00:33:41,710
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

587
00:33:46,881 --> 00:33:49,381
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

588
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,950
Congratulations.

589
00:34:06,841 --> 00:34:08,841
Congratulations, Managing Partner Oh.

590
00:34:09,341 --> 00:34:11,171
I haven't officially taken office yet.

591
00:34:11,571 --> 00:34:13,881
Fine. Did you see the news article?

592
00:34:14,611 --> 00:34:17,551
The success story of a lawyer with only a high school diploma.

593
00:34:17,781 --> 00:34:22,080
The first female managing partner from the top ten law firms in Korea.

594
00:34:23,421 --> 00:34:24,821
You have a lot of requests for interviews.

595
00:34:24,951 --> 00:34:26,720
Turn down all of the interviews,

596
00:34:26,721 --> 00:34:28,591
and ask the maintenance staff to move these out of my office.

597
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,059
But why?

598
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,761
It'll be great. Everyone's going to be jealous.

599
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,730
Look at them. They've all fallen into some collective depression.

600
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,691
Come on in, our new managing partner.

601
00:34:59,991 --> 00:35:03,591
There was someone who was sure they would get the position.

602
00:35:05,991 --> 00:35:07,300
Thank you.

603
00:35:07,301 --> 00:35:11,071
You never know how HR decisions are going to turn out until the end.

604
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,140
Min Young Bae was overly confident.

605
00:35:15,301 --> 00:35:16,710
You hustled.

606
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,410
Assemblyman An Kang Won.

607
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:23,810
You know him, right?

608
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:27,551
He seems to have...

609
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,651
played around with some girl at a hostess bar.

610
00:35:31,691 --> 00:35:33,019
The problem is she's going around...

611
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,491
saying she got raped.

612
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,390
Assemblyman Lee is asking us to quietly cover it up.

613
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:42,930
Why would he ask us to do that?

614
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:46,370
Aren't they rivals?

615
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,401
I even heard they don't get along.

616
00:35:48,441 --> 00:35:51,910
It's also not good for Assemblyman Lee...

617
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,111
if a rival within his own party is caught up in a scandal.

618
00:35:54,781 --> 00:35:56,950
Assemblymen fight in front of the camera,

619
00:35:56,951 --> 00:36:00,151
but in private, they eat together and go to the sauna together.

620
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,421
Don't you know?

621
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:02,951
I see.

622
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,620
Also, about that information you found.

623
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,160
Chairman Han was furious, so I told him...

624
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,401
Whatever is in Soo Jae's hands is also in mine.

625
00:36:15,701 --> 00:36:17,171
I told him not to worry.

626
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,540
It's just double bookkeeping.

627
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,841
He must've built up a slush fund. What's the big deal?

628
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,780
If you got what you wanted using the information,

629
00:36:27,781 --> 00:36:30,850
clean it up and give it back.

630
00:36:31,451 --> 00:36:35,051
Of course. I'm going to help with the sale.

631
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:37,220
There won't be any issues.

632
00:36:37,221 --> 00:36:39,051
As it should be.

633
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,091
There can't be any issues.

634
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:48,460
Your inauguration. I'll make a good one.

635
00:36:48,801 --> 00:36:50,131
Buy me dinner before then.

636
00:36:50,301 --> 00:36:53,500
Let's get fresh fish from the market and eat some sashimi.

637
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,140
You got the position you wanted and a big case.

638
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,011
You owe me.

639
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:02,040
Yes.

640
00:37:11,221 --> 00:37:12,390
Ms. Oh.

641
00:37:20,031 --> 00:37:22,160
Here's the additional information on Park So Young.

642
00:37:22,631 --> 00:37:24,671
Family relations, any rumours within her community.

643
00:37:25,131 --> 00:37:27,441
The video recording is on the USB drive.

644
00:37:28,841 --> 00:37:33,011
Did you look into Assemblyman An Kang Won also?

645
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:35,841
I haven't. Do you need me to?

646
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,980
No. It's okay.

647
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,250
(Park So Young)

648
00:37:44,951 --> 00:37:46,220
Gosh.

649
00:37:46,221 --> 00:37:48,789
This piece of trash.

650
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:51,390
He's about to be president...

651
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,229
(Kang)

652
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,071
What is all this anyway?

653
00:37:59,531 --> 00:38:01,270
Park So Young. She works at a hostess bar.

654
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:04,540
She's claiming she was raped by Assemblyman An.

655
00:38:05,171 --> 00:38:07,880
Chairman Han ordered me to keep her quiet.

656
00:38:07,881 --> 00:38:10,511
Why? She could be a victim.

657
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,780
It's biased to assume she's lying just because she's a hostess.

658
00:38:14,781 --> 00:38:16,250
Aren't you also biased?

659
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,921
Why are you assuming she's a victim just because she's a woman?

660
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:21,060
What if she is really a gold digger?

661
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,230
What if Assemblyman An is really a victim?

662
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,600
(Kang)

663
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:48,951
Soo Jae.

664
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:53,960
It's not true.

665
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,790
I've been there a few times, and I was really drunk,

666
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:59,901
but it's not true. I don't remember a thing.

667
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:02,131
I'm being framed.

668
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:05,301
Someone's using Park So Young to ruin me.

669
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,500
Are you so important that someone would try to ruin you?

670
00:39:09,801 --> 00:39:12,640
You've gained popularity by working on your public image.

671
00:39:12,841 --> 00:39:16,080
You seem excited that you became a potential presidential candidate.

672
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,079
But the fact that you're even being considered a candidate...

673
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,080
is proof that Korea's politics are still lousy.

674
00:39:24,191 --> 00:39:26,390
Then why did you date me?

675
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:29,860
- A big toy. - What?

676
00:39:29,861 --> 00:39:33,160
It was funny to see you begging and spending money on me.

677
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:38,401
It was also fun to see you pleading for me to wear the shoes you got me.

678
00:39:40,801 --> 00:39:44,071
You were perfect as a toy that I play with and then throw away.

679
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:47,040
What result do you want?

680
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,111
I'm asking as a lawyer what my client wants...

681
00:39:52,111 --> 00:39:53,680
and what the desired result is.

682
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,991
Help keep my political career alive.

683
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,159
Make it pass by...

684
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,790
like a baseless rumour.

685
00:40:04,531 --> 00:40:05,631
Help me out.

686
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,660
Get on your knees then.

687
00:40:10,071 --> 00:40:13,671
Give you what you want and end your political career...

688
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,270
or get on your knees.

689
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,050
Hold on.

690
00:40:24,051 --> 00:40:25,910
(Assemblyman Lee In Soo)

691
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,250
Yes, Assemblyman Lee.

692
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,321
Yes.

693
00:40:35,861 --> 00:40:36,960
I understand.

694
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,680
Please save me.

695
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,290
You and I...

696
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,191
never...

697
00:41:15,031 --> 00:41:16,230
met personally.

698
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:35,451
Let's go.

699
00:41:44,531 --> 00:41:46,591
Gosh. What a surprise.

700
00:41:47,131 --> 00:41:48,861
We have similar tastes.

701
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,370
These shoes are very expensive.

702
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:01,040
You must make a lot of money.

703
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:04,080
Park So Young. Your attitude is a bit cheap.

704
00:42:09,221 --> 00:42:11,850
Have you met Assemblyman An Kang Won before the incident?

705
00:42:12,091 --> 00:42:13,150
No.

706
00:42:13,151 --> 00:42:15,991
Even if you hadn't, you knew who he was, right?

707
00:42:16,091 --> 00:42:18,260
An unmarried assemblyman who used to be an actor.

708
00:42:18,261 --> 00:42:21,060
He's popular and has a great public image.

709
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:23,870
But among us, his nickname is "Dog".

710
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:27,071
A dirty, crazy dog.

711
00:42:27,571 --> 00:42:29,471
But it's a VIP.

712
00:42:29,701 --> 00:42:31,611
He spends a lot of money.

713
00:42:32,171 --> 00:42:33,910
So were you trying to take that money?

714
00:42:34,741 --> 00:42:35,841
No.

715
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,881
I'm a victim.

716
00:42:39,111 --> 00:42:40,921
A rape victim.

717
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,151
I even have proof.

718
00:42:45,951 --> 00:42:47,261
I don't care.

719
00:42:48,721 --> 00:42:49,890
What's your dream?

720
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:52,261
Do you not have one?

721
00:42:52,631 --> 00:42:54,430
Then what did it used to be?

722
00:42:55,401 --> 00:42:58,600
There's no way your dream was to be what you are now.

723
00:42:58,671 --> 00:43:00,841
In Korea, such a thing as a dream...

724
00:43:03,671 --> 00:43:04,710
Why?

725
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,340
You accomplished your dream, so you're sitting over there,

726
00:43:07,341 --> 00:43:09,980
and I didn't accomplish mine, so I'm sitting over here.

727
00:43:10,511 --> 00:43:12,011
Are you trying to teach me a lesson?

728
00:43:13,111 --> 00:43:14,421
I'm curious.

729
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:17,951
Why would you do something like this?

730
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,050
I'm asking because I'm curious.

731
00:43:20,051 --> 00:43:21,861
I didn't do anything. Something happened to me.

732
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,760
Something was done to me.

733
00:43:24,761 --> 00:43:26,830
I'm the victim!

734
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:31,830
Why are you not doing anything? Are you a lawyer or what?

735
00:43:32,131 --> 00:43:34,540
Yes. One second.

736
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:37,941
Right. Ms. Oh.

737
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:42,080
I have evidence.

738
00:43:42,241 --> 00:43:44,450
They found Congressman An Kang Won's DNA...

739
00:43:44,451 --> 00:43:47,250
on Ms. Park's underwear, which I submitted for evidence.

740
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,249
That's clear proof that she was raped.

741
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:52,220
To prove that it was rape,

742
00:43:52,221 --> 00:43:53,820
you have to show...

743
00:43:53,821 --> 00:43:57,560
that she was forced against her will using physical force or threats.

744
00:43:57,861 --> 00:44:00,960
How do you prove she was forced with the DNA from her underwear?

745
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:04,829
There would be DNA on her underwear even if she had consented.

746
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:06,900
Right. However,

747
00:44:06,901 --> 00:44:10,409
Ms. Park is consistent in her testimony.

748
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:13,880
Also, it's common nowadays for the victim's testimony...

749
00:44:13,881 --> 00:44:16,680
to be given priority.

750
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,551
She's laughing.

751
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:24,091
How can you laugh...

752
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:26,051
hearing another woman has been raped?

753
00:44:26,451 --> 00:44:29,361
How can you be like that?

754
00:44:29,591 --> 00:44:30,691
Mi Rim.

755
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,361
You flirted with Congressman An first.

756
00:44:36,901 --> 00:44:38,801
That So Young is so funny.

757
00:44:38,971 --> 00:44:42,171
She flirts with him all innocently, then stabs him in the back.

758
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,011
That's her strategy.

759
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:47,810
Hey!

760
00:44:58,691 --> 00:45:01,390
Your dad's an alcoholic. Your mom's sick.

761
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,631
Does your younger sister know what you do for work?

762
00:45:05,091 --> 00:45:07,600
Do you want me to post this video on your sister's school website?

763
00:45:07,701 --> 00:45:10,100
I can send it to people at your mom's hospital.

764
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,139
Shut up.

765
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,901
Do you think you can live a normal life, Ms. Park?

766
00:45:17,571 --> 00:45:20,381
There's nothing Korean netizens can't find.

767
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,440
I can spread information about you no matter where you go.

768
00:45:23,441 --> 00:45:25,480
You'll want to die.

769
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:30,180
Ms. Park. Relax and have a seat.

770
00:45:31,051 --> 00:45:34,019
Really. Secretly recording videos and threatening the victim's family.

771
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,290
Aren't you being too harsh?

772
00:45:39,191 --> 00:45:40,430
What year did you enter the training institute?

773
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,971
I didn't attend the institute. I was in the ninth class of law school.

774
00:45:44,131 --> 00:45:45,869
And you're trying to win against me?

775
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:48,000
No. I mean...

776
00:45:48,741 --> 00:45:50,971
I'm not saying I'm going to lose.

777
00:45:52,671 --> 00:45:54,310
Listen up, Ms. Park.

778
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,980
When a woman is sexually assaulted in Korea,

779
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:02,020
the law is not on the woman's side. Public opinion is even less so.

780
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:04,290
What do you think of that, 9th graduating class of law school?

781
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,191
But...

782
00:46:07,221 --> 00:46:11,060
However, we have to think from the victim's side.

783
00:46:11,191 --> 00:46:14,761
And recently, the victim's testimony...

784
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,530
is given priority...

785
00:46:16,531 --> 00:46:19,499
Let's say you are the victim and we go to court.

786
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,870
Do you think you can beat me in court, 9th class?

787
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,241
Ms. Park.

788
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:32,611
You lost your sense of judgement because you were drunk.

789
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,921
You never even met Congressman An.

790
00:46:36,881 --> 00:46:39,250
The end. Okay?

791
00:46:39,921 --> 00:46:41,290
Was this...

792
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,390
your dream?

793
00:46:45,031 --> 00:46:46,531
Becoming a lawyer...

794
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,160
who threatens the victim...

795
00:46:49,401 --> 00:46:51,301
and makes them want to kill themselves.

796
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:53,770
Was that your dream?

797
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Why would you die? You should live.

798
00:46:58,741 --> 00:47:00,140
Curse me as you keep living.

799
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:04,050
Cursing someone magically...

800
00:47:04,051 --> 00:47:05,710
gives you the strength to live.

801
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,850
Let me know if you need a lawyer.

802
00:47:12,821 --> 00:47:14,060
(Lawyer Oh Soo Jae)

803
00:47:14,921 --> 00:47:16,290
He isn't it.

804
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:18,191
What a novice.

805
00:47:19,361 --> 00:47:21,660
He's not able to protect his client at all.

806
00:47:35,341 --> 00:47:36,881
Hey, you crazy wench!

807
00:47:40,051 --> 00:47:42,520
You don't have a dream either.

808
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:44,520
You don't have one either!

809
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:55,861
No.

810
00:47:57,330 --> 00:47:58,600
I do have one.

811
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,841
Getting all the way to the top.

812
00:48:04,971 --> 00:48:06,441
That's my dream,

813
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:09,480
and I'm half of the way there.

814
00:48:15,281 --> 00:48:16,921
I'm different from you.

815
00:48:27,901 --> 00:48:29,031
Park So Young...

816
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:32,801
seems to be telling the truth, at least partially.

817
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:36,071
An Kang Won is my client, not Park So Young.

818
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:41,040
Do you know what Park So Young did wrong?

819
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:44,680
She didn't hire me as her lawyer.

820
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:02,701
Is there anything you need?

821
00:49:03,031 --> 00:49:04,031
Go home.

822
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,930
I'll be going, then.

823
00:49:41,071 --> 00:49:42,671
I brought the car out front.

824
00:51:11,091 --> 00:51:12,160
Ms. Oh.

825
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:14,830
Ms. Oh. Are you okay?

826
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:17,801
Call 911. Hurry. Call the police.

827
00:51:17,901 --> 00:51:19,171
Hurry. Keep people out.

828
00:51:27,781 --> 00:51:29,511
(Lawyer Oh Soo Jae)

829
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:38,591
(Luxury Taxi)

830
00:52:24,401 --> 00:52:25,531
Shut up.

831
00:52:25,671 --> 00:52:28,301
Do you think you can live a normal life, Ms. Park?

832
00:52:28,801 --> 00:52:31,570
I can spread information about you no matter where you go.

833
00:52:31,571 --> 00:52:33,639
You'll want to die.

834
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,381
Hey, you crazy wench!

835
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:37,951
You don't have a dream either.

836
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,250
I'm different from you.

837
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,691
(Song Mi Rim)

838
00:53:25,691 --> 00:53:27,031
There was a security camera inspection at the time,

839
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,160
so there's no footage.

840
00:53:28,801 --> 00:53:30,631
How did she get up there?

841
00:53:35,341 --> 00:53:36,970
(Song Mi Rim)

842
00:53:36,971 --> 00:53:40,341
The police are going to say it's suicide due to personal reasons.

843
00:53:57,591 --> 00:53:59,430
- There's Lawyer Oh Soo Jae! - She's here!

844
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:01,659
Ms. Oh Soo Jae!

845
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:04,170
Why did Park So Young jump off the TK Law Firm's building?

846
00:54:04,171 --> 00:54:05,171
I don't know.

847
00:54:05,172 --> 00:54:06,801
Do you feel guilty about what happened?

848
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:07,869
Not at all.

849
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:10,909
We heard you were very harsh on her because she wasn't a career woman.

850
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:13,539
And you also trampled on the rights of career women.

851
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:14,910
Give us a comment.

852
00:54:18,451 --> 00:54:20,051
Aren't you a career woman too?

853
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:23,821
Because you have a stable job.

854
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:27,321
Then you are a career man.

855
00:54:29,421 --> 00:54:31,229
No wonder why reporters are looked down on.

856
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:32,560
Listen to your cheap phrases.

857
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:35,500
Oh, right. People call you guys rotten too these days...

858
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:39,500
because you guys swarm over to rotten information.

859
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,840
- What? Seriously? - What did you just say? Rotten?

860
00:54:44,841 --> 00:54:47,341
- How dare you call us rotten? - You think you're better than us?

861
00:54:47,741 --> 00:54:50,040
We must use this incident to kick her out, sir.

862
00:54:50,611 --> 00:54:52,980
Our high-profile clients have been shaken up for days.

863
00:54:53,611 --> 00:54:56,721
Our reputation has been damaged severely because of her.

864
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:58,890
This is a serious problem, sir.

865
00:54:59,191 --> 00:55:02,120
It's a fact that Soo Jae cornered Park So Young to the extreme.

866
00:55:02,261 --> 00:55:03,960
I saw her do so...

867
00:55:04,091 --> 00:55:06,160
even after the meeting with my two eyes.

868
00:55:09,301 --> 00:55:13,000
I believe giving her a break would be a nice alternative, sir.

869
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:14,440
We can't have an inauguration ceremony...

870
00:55:14,441 --> 00:55:15,570
given the recent turn of events.

871
00:55:15,571 --> 00:55:17,370
Please reconsider, sir.

872
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,139
Why don't we give Soo Jae a break for the time being?

873
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:22,809
We can say that she's going abroad for more training.

874
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:24,579
How about sending her...

875
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,880
to our branches in the US or China for a year?

876
00:55:26,881 --> 00:55:28,750
A year won't be enough.

877
00:55:33,951 --> 00:55:35,221
Has anyone here...

878
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:38,861
brought in more money to the firm than me?

879
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:44,159
Or has anyone here won more trials than me?

880
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,071
That's not everything!

881
00:55:46,701 --> 00:55:50,370
The lawyers of TK Law Firm must have dignity and class.

882
00:55:50,971 --> 00:55:53,741
Park So Young committed suicide because of you.

883
00:55:54,071 --> 00:55:58,781
TK Law Firm has been disgraced. Do you see that?

884
00:56:01,551 --> 00:56:02,651
Young Bae.

885
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,850
I'm TK Law Firm.

886
00:56:06,921 --> 00:56:08,660
And TK Law Firm is me.

887
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:12,531
I have lived every day of my life for TK Law Firm.

888
00:56:12,631 --> 00:56:14,600
But you want to kick me out of the country?

889
00:56:17,901 --> 00:56:19,730
If you're going to do that, kill me instead.

890
00:56:24,571 --> 00:56:25,671
Sir.

891
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:30,040
You looked down on me because I was a high school graduate.

892
00:56:31,151 --> 00:56:34,111
And you never let me join the meetings.

893
00:56:34,951 --> 00:56:36,720
Gosh,

894
00:56:36,721 --> 00:56:39,720
you called me every time you drank. "Why would we call escorts?"

895
00:56:39,721 --> 00:56:41,921
"We can call Soo Jae!"

896
00:56:42,191 --> 00:56:44,120
You said that numerous times.

897
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:50,131
And you put your name on my reporters countless times.

898
00:56:51,301 --> 00:56:52,401
And you.

899
00:56:54,401 --> 00:56:55,471
Forget it.

900
00:56:56,701 --> 00:57:00,370
I feel awful for you. I just want you to know that.

901
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:05,610
Despite all the disadvantages,

902
00:57:05,611 --> 00:57:07,611
I became the managing partner!

903
00:57:10,721 --> 00:57:13,221
Because I gave up on having a life to get this far.

904
00:57:14,421 --> 00:57:16,421
So if you come after me,

905
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:19,591
you'll get hurt.

906
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:21,631
Are we clear?

907
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:45,850
You are TK Law Firm, and TK Law Firm is you?

908
00:58:00,631 --> 00:58:02,901
Gosh. Has it been eight years?

909
00:58:03,171 --> 00:58:04,471
You've gotten prettier.

910
00:58:04,841 --> 00:58:06,171
Did you hear I was coming?

911
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:09,640
Right. I hear you're in a tight spot because someone died.

912
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,310
Let me know if you need any help.

913
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:13,910
Who will help?

914
00:58:14,921 --> 00:58:17,580
- You will help me? - Yes.

915
00:58:17,951 --> 00:58:19,491
Choi Ju Wan wants to help me?

916
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:39,971
All right.

917
00:58:40,341 --> 00:58:44,410
This sea bream is my treat to all of you! Drink until you drop!

918
00:58:45,651 --> 00:58:47,080
Over there.

919
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:51,591
- Nice! - That looks great!

920
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:54,559
Gosh. You know what? My boss got into law school...

921
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,221
and bought a lot in a commercial building, so we're moving there.

922
00:58:56,261 --> 00:58:57,320
Isn't it amazing?

923
00:58:57,321 --> 00:58:59,229
- That's great! - Good for you!

924
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:01,229
- Eat a lot. - Okay.

925
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:04,261
- Eat a lot. - What would you like?

926
00:59:04,671 --> 00:59:06,671
- A snapper, please. - A snapper?

927
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:08,340
I thought you wanted Chinese herrings earlier.

928
00:59:08,341 --> 00:59:09,540
(Amazing News! Gong Chan Gets Into Law School!)

929
00:59:12,071 --> 00:59:13,841
Do you know why I like coming here?

930
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:18,611
Because it's fun to slice up those live fish.

931
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:22,180
"Kill that fish and bring it to me."

932
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,060
I get to chew the fish that was alive only a moment ago.

933
00:59:32,761 --> 00:59:33,991
I love that.

934
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,599
I know better than anyone...

935
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,701
that you put up with all the hours and work,

936
00:59:40,471 --> 00:59:42,171
so you could rule TK Law Firm.

937
00:59:43,401 --> 00:59:44,571
But Soo Jae.

938
00:59:45,071 --> 00:59:46,971
Do you think I would let all my hard work benefit someone else?

939
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:49,210
If that's the case, I would just quit.

940
00:59:50,611 --> 00:59:51,980
Here's a thing about dogs.

941
00:59:53,951 --> 00:59:56,550
They must always be loyal to their masters, know their place,

942
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:57,651
and have humility.

943
01:00:00,721 --> 01:00:02,091
Only those dogs are cherished.

944
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:06,560
Go on a break.

945
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:11,729
A law professor at Seojung University.

946
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:13,500
It won't be long. Just for a semester.

947
01:00:15,701 --> 01:00:18,370
Sir, your offer is flustering me.

948
01:00:18,441 --> 01:00:21,240
Baek Jin Ki is the director there.

949
01:00:21,241 --> 01:00:22,910
He's very worried about you.

950
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:25,151
He said he would put aside a position for you.

951
01:00:25,611 --> 01:00:27,011
I would like to decline the offer.

952
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:32,721
I'm not making an offer. It's an order.

953
01:00:34,591 --> 01:00:36,060
And you can be...

954
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:39,861
a managing partner next time. Okay?

955
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:41,260
I'm about to be inaugurated.

956
01:00:41,261 --> 01:00:43,160
But taking my position away to get your way...

957
01:00:43,301 --> 01:00:44,631
It's mine.

958
01:00:45,801 --> 01:00:48,971
All the positions belong to me.

959
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:51,709
Interns, associates, partners, and managing partners.

960
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:54,310
Even those lowly positions for security guards and cleaners.

961
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:59,111
They are all mine.

962
01:01:04,651 --> 01:01:05,850
Park So Young.

963
01:01:07,421 --> 01:01:09,160
Did I tell her to do so?

964
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:12,531
Park So Young.

965
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:15,560
Did I kill her?

966
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:18,801
Answer me, sir!

967
01:01:20,201 --> 01:01:21,701
She's dead because of you.

968
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:24,741
That's what people are saying.

969
01:01:27,441 --> 01:01:28,580
And so is the world.

970
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:42,691
I'm so sorry.

971
01:01:43,321 --> 01:01:45,560
- Are you okay? - I'm all right.

972
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:47,430
I'll clean this up right away.

973
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:55,301
I'm so sorry.

974
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:17,120
- Soo Jae. - Yes?

975
01:03:18,191 --> 01:03:21,820
I have no worries because I have...

976
01:03:21,821 --> 01:03:23,390
such a kind and smart daughter.

977
01:03:23,821 --> 01:03:25,861
- You have no worries? - You bet.

978
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:30,000
The hardest thing in life is getting people to open up to you.

979
01:03:30,701 --> 01:03:32,929
But you're kind and smart,

980
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:35,571
So everyone you meet will open up to you.

981
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:46,051
No, Dad. That's not true.

982
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:57,060
How could you leave us so soon?

983
01:03:58,491 --> 01:04:00,960
What about our children?

984
01:04:03,261 --> 01:04:05,801
How could you be so cruel?

985
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:09,240
- I'm going to leave with him! - Mom!

986
01:04:09,241 --> 01:04:10,800
- Let go of me. - Are you crazy, Mom?

987
01:04:10,801 --> 01:04:12,471
- The water is deep here! - I'm going with him!

988
01:04:13,071 --> 01:04:16,640
Soo Jae, become a good lawyer...

989
01:04:17,011 --> 01:04:18,850
people can open up to.

990
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:34,290
Why me?

991
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:35,930
Why?

992
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,401
She's dead because of you.

993
01:04:45,611 --> 01:04:47,570
Do you feel guilty about what happened?

994
01:04:47,571 --> 01:04:50,140
That's what people are saying. And so is the world.

995
01:04:55,151 --> 01:04:56,580
I will look up higher.

996
01:04:58,151 --> 01:04:59,890
I will stand at the top of the world...

997
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:02,321
and look up much higher!

998
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,930
I guess you weren't ready to go yet. You managed to come to me.

999
01:05:48,770 --> 01:05:50,471
What did I tell you?

1000
01:05:50,971 --> 01:05:52,941
Didn't I tell you arrhythmia was a serious condition...

1001
01:05:53,071 --> 01:05:55,011
and it could even kill you?

1002
01:05:55,810 --> 01:05:57,479
Forget about being the managing partner.

1003
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,750
You could really die if you don't rest!

1004
01:06:01,551 --> 01:06:04,151
I would have quit long ago if I was ever going to quit.

1005
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,320
If you were going to quit, you wouldn't have gone back...

1006
01:06:06,321 --> 01:06:08,151
after you came back from the US.

1007
01:06:08,321 --> 01:06:09,991
Gosh, you're so stubborn.

1008
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:12,960
Soo Jae.

1009
01:06:13,361 --> 01:06:15,530
Soo Jae. You seem to have recovered.

1010
01:06:15,531 --> 01:06:16,560
Yes.

1011
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:20,571
Don't worry about arrhythmia. Just keep living your life.

1012
01:06:20,901 --> 01:06:23,201
If you don't feel good, come here and pass out.

1013
01:06:23,241 --> 01:06:25,910
Jun Hee and I can bring you back to life. Right?

1014
01:06:27,471 --> 01:06:29,480
I noticed a pile of packages again.

1015
01:06:29,781 --> 01:06:31,510
Right. We should go camping together next time.

1016
01:06:31,511 --> 01:06:33,709
We can gaze at the camp fire all day...

1017
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:36,850
and drink all night. Drinking like that will help us...

1018
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:38,151
with our mental health.

1019
01:06:40,821 --> 01:06:41,991
Don't look at me like that.

1020
01:06:43,091 --> 01:06:45,191
You might give me an arrhythmia. I'll go and see my patients.

1021
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,460
Did you hear him? You collapsed because of your arrhythmia.

1022
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:54,600
But he wants to drink with you all night.

1023
01:06:55,401 --> 01:06:56,600

Professor.

1030
01:07:59,401 --> 01:08:01,230
Why are our seats assigned?

1031
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:03,300
I want to sit in the front row, so I can focus better.

1032
01:08:03,301 --> 01:08:04,671
I'm the TA.

1033
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:07,441
The seats were assigned based on your grades.

1034
01:08:07,841 --> 01:08:09,039
From highest to lowest.

1035
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,410
Then people in Group Eight had the lowest grades?

1036
01:08:12,281 --> 01:08:13,381
Me?

1037
01:08:18,991 --> 01:08:20,390
Gosh. This is embarrassing.

1038
01:08:20,451 --> 01:08:22,390
Seriously? They are based on our grades?

1039
01:08:23,121 --> 01:08:25,530
This is lame. Right?

1040
01:08:25,531 --> 01:08:26,629
We're lucky we got in.

1041
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:27,760
What's so bad about being on the bottom?

1042
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:29,630
I'm not embarrassed at all.

Her lecture time is about to be over.

Hey, I'm your lawyer.

You're not going to listen to me just like the other lawyers.

1070
01:11:21,001 --> 01:11:22,401
So get lost.

1071
