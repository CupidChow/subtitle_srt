(This is a work of fiction. All characters, places, incidents,)

2
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,949
(and organizations portrayed in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:18,249
You said no to the managing partner title.

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,549
What do you want?

5
00:00:23,459 --> 00:00:24,589
Seventy million dollars.

6
00:00:25,389 --> 00:00:26,459
What?

7
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:28,029
Choose.

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,068
Do you want me to ruin the big picture...

9
00:00:31,069 --> 00:00:33,330
you've been painting with great effort?

10
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,509
Or pay me the fee for the sell-off of Hansu Bio,

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,910
seventy million dollars.

12
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:44,709
So you won't ruin my plans if I pay you for using your name.

13
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:47,579
And you want 70 million dollars?

14
00:00:59,029 --> 00:01:00,160
But how can I trust you?

15
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:04,199
You're sending a sign that you could make everyone end up in the gutter,

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,630
so how can I trust you?

17
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,300
I do not want all of you to end up in the gutter.

18
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,140
In fact, I want to see the three of you celebrate further success.

19
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:14,580
Chairman Han will make big money through the sell-off of Hansu Bio.

20
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:17,549
Assemblyman Lee will use that to win the presidential race.

21
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,750
And you.

22
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,649
You'll use them to lay the groundwork for the next step.

23
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,989
"Those who put their own personal gain first..."

24
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,330
"are more trustworthy than those who don't."

25
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,529
Look at you using what I told you in the past.

26
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,360
For my own personal gain,

27
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,399
I will make sure that the info on the flash drive won't get out.

28
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,600
Then as soon as the sell-off is completed,

29
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:44,940
I will return it to you.

30
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:48,580
The moment you have it,

31
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,449
you'll get your hands on the weaknesses of Chairman Han...

32
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,380
and Assemblyman Lee, who will go on to become President.

33
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,550
Isn't that what you want?

34
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,589
But how will you make me trust that there is no copy?

35
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,229
Kindness breeds kindness.

36
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,899
Promise me that you will pay me...

37
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,699
for using my name, and I will not make a copy.

38
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,999
Okay. Looks like that tiny flash drive...

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,440
will cost me 70 million dollars.

40
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,238
I thought I'd tamed you into a docile dog...

41
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,340
that I could use and hunt down,

42
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:24,709
but you're asking for a crazy deal from me, Soo Jae.

43
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,049
A deal...

44
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,750
I regret that I'm only getting around to it now.

45
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,350
And just so you know,

46
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,190
I was never your "hound".

47
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:39,060
Had I been a docile dog,

48
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,160
you would've gotten rid of me long ago.

49
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:46,769
Regarding Ju Wan, can you get his divorce sorted out quickly?

50
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:49,569
You're getting 70 million dollars, so you can do that much.

51
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:54,639
(Episode 6)

52
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,318
I told you to keep Soo Jae in check, but you got her fired up.

53
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,449
I'm sorry, sir.

54
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,190
Yield to all her requests regarding the sell-off.

55
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,789
- Do you understand? - Sorry? What do you mean...

56
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,359
She knows about the Bahamas bank account in her name.

57
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:22,068
Listen up. If you still want that 27 million dollars,

58
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,440
just do as I say,

59
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,609
exactly as you're told.

60
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,239
No funny business.

61
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,250
Yes, sir.

62
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,889
What were you doing, Mr. Ha?

63
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,988
The flash drive ended up in Soo Jae's hands.

64
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:46,029
What were you doing when all of that was going down?

65
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,190
I apologize, sir.

66
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,930
I did find out that the files that had been moved...

67
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,970
to Gong Chan's place were moved back to Ms. Oh's place, but...

68
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,198
Please forgive me, sir.

69
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,600
Who is that kid, Gong Chan?

70
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:00,839
He runs a bar...

71
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,440
with two friends who are like his brothers.

72
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:06,750
I heard he had worked at the fish market for a long time.

73
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:10,349
He and Ms. Oh live close to each other,

74
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,220
but they don't seem to have anything else in common.

75
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,889
I'll do some more digging though.

76
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,460
Why bother?

77
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,630
There's no need.

78
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,499
He's probably one of the law school kids...

79
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,470
who are trying to curry favour with Soo Jae knowing she's a TK lawyer.

80
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,929
Idiots.

81

(Oh Soo Jae)

91
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:55,460
So it was Professor Oh.

92
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:02,739
Goodness. I was wondering what all the fuss was about.

93
00:05:03,739 --> 00:05:06,309
You brought her here, fixed a meal for her,

94
00:05:06,369 --> 00:05:08,878
and made us go to her building in the middle of the night...

95
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:11,280
and move all the boxes. You kicked up such a fuss.

96
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,150
When did you find out...

97
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,049
that she was that public defender?

98
00:05:20,749 --> 00:05:23,359
When I started law school, on my first day of class.

99
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:25,488
Before that, you had no idea?

100
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:26,559
No idea at all.

101
00:05:26,929 --> 00:05:28,030
You know...

102
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,899
that I rarely read the newspapers or watch the news...

103
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,600
because I'm afraid I'd see my name, Kim Dong Gu.

104
00:05:34,429 --> 00:05:35,640
Oh, boy.

105
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:39,309
You see, I do not miss my life as Kim Dong Gu.

106
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,080
I'm much happier as Gong Chan.

107
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,580
I don't have to worry when someone calls my name.

108
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,249
I started feeling at ease...

109
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:53,849
when I changed my name.

110
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,859
Goodness.

111
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,359
You say that, but you still can't let this go.

112
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:02,729
My, these people are even more successful now.

113
00:06:02,859 --> 00:06:05,729
That chief prosecutor is the chairman of a law firm now.

114
00:06:05,869 --> 00:06:07,668
The prosecutor who treated you like dirt...

115
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:09,939
is the professor involved in the sexual assault scandal.

116
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,009
And Professor Oh...

117
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,309
worked under the chairman even back then?

118
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,109
They're all connected. What a mess.

119
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,150
It's a small world, you know.

120
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,879
The legal industry is even smaller.

121
00:06:24,179 --> 00:06:25,220
Forget it.

122
00:06:26,989 --> 00:06:29,359
Hey! Just get rid of this already.

123
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:31,119
Look.

124
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:33,960
No Byung Chul is the killer.

125
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:36,629
He confessed to it.

126
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,669
He said he killed Jeon Na Jung...

127
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:41,269
and threw her body in the ocean so no one would find it.

128
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,538
He said that himself and has been in jail for the past nine years.

129
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:47,669
You're the only one who's still in denial, you idiot.

130
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:49,609
Just get rid of all this.

131
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:51,379
No!

132
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,049
I said, no.

133
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,479
He's not the killer.

134
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,950
I know. I know that it wasn't him.

135
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:02,320
I know he didn't do it.

136
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,260
Fine.

137
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:06,330
Let's say you're right...

138
00:07:07,429 --> 00:07:08,729
and that it wasn't him.

139
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,129
You've been acquitted, so let's just leave it at that.

140
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,199
Just live quietly as Gong Chan.

141
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,499
You said you were happier as Gong Chan.

142
00:07:16,299 --> 00:07:18,410
After all, isn't that why you're fooling your professor?

143
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,939
Hiding from her that you're Kim Dong Gu.

144
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,479
But you know what, Chan?

145
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,280
If you like someone,

146
00:07:30,619 --> 00:07:32,090
you shouldn't deceive them for a long time.

147
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,900
Don't drink so much.

148
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,799
You'll pass out here at this rate.

149
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:51,939
I know.

150
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,239
You silly goose.

151
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:57,080
I got her.

152
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,280
You, Oh Soo Jae.

153
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:03,119
Gosh, you.

154
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,150
What? What did I do?

155
00:08:05,489 --> 00:08:08,890
Hey, 70 million dollars isn't chump change.

156
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,759
The chairman said he'd give it to you...

157
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,788
because he felt cornered at that moment,

158
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:15,429
but do you think he'll actually give it to you?

159
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:19,269
Trying to get that money from him could cost you your life, you fool.

160
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,470
Hey.

161
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,569
Do you know what my name means in Chinese characters?

162
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,909
"Soo" probably means "outstanding", and "Jae" means "talent".

163
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,608
I know your brothers' names too.

164
00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:30,580
Chun Jae, Young Jae, and Soo Jae. Your father named the three of you.

165
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,048
My dad...

166
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:36,220
used the character for "talent" for the "Jae" in my brothers' names,

167
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:39,689
but not for my name.

168
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,220
Really? What does it mean, then?

169
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:45,589
"Soo" means "outstanding", and "Jae" means "pure".

170
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,759
He wanted you to be an outstanding person who's pure in heart.

171
00:08:48,499 --> 00:08:50,398
That's so sweet.

172
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,330
But they dared to use my name.

173
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:59,210
To launder the money they had embezzled.

174
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,550
For a moment, I considered exposing it.

175
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:14,019
But if I do that, I may end up in jail...

176
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,259
because that's exactly why they used my name.

177
00:09:17,989 --> 00:09:20,060
It'd be so easy to make me take the fall for everything.

178
00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:24,869
So exposing it is not the answer.

179
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:28,970
I can't ruin my own future.

180
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:32,769
I'll shake them up...

181
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:35,379
and eat them alive.

182
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,909
I don't really understand what you're talking about right now.

183
00:09:40,249 --> 00:09:41,379
Just sleep.

184
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,060
She's fast asleep. I can't wake her up now.

185
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,220
It's been about 15 minutes.

186
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,690
I'll let her sleep for just five more minutes.

187
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:57,029
Okay, keep the camp fire going.

188
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,930
Don't put it out.

189
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,470
Okay.

190
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:02,700
Sorry.

191
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,070
My goodness.

192
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,210
Soo Jae, someone's calling you. Who is it?

193
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:16,979
(Gong Chan)

194
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,720
Gong Chan?

195
00:10:19,249 --> 00:10:21,619
He already found out too much about me.

196
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:23,960
I think he might find out everything.

197
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,190
That's incredibly embarrassing.

198
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:30,759
I'd love to just let him take care of you and get going.

199
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,899
But then, he'd see you like this, and you'd be even more embarrassed.

200
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:35,570
I can't do that to you.

201
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,710
Bye, Gong Chan. Sorry.

202
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,440
- Isn't that... - My gosh!

203
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,009
Professor Oh Soo Jae's phone?

204
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,479
Oh, are you... Gong Chan?

205
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:52,389
My gosh.

206
00:10:53,489 --> 00:10:55,358
- What's going on? - It's...

207
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,858
What are you doing here?

208
00:10:56,859 --> 00:10:57,920
What?

209
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,528
Hey, he called you when you were asleep.

210
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:03,300
So did you tell him to come here?

211
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,070
I really didn't want to see him today.

212
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,498
Hey, it's mean to say stuff like that to his face.

213
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:11,399
Okay. I'm sorry for saying this to your face,

214
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,840
but you make me uncomfortable. I want you out of my sight.

215
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,779
Especially today and now.

216
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,710
So leave.

217
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,850
The feeling is mutual.

218
00:11:27,989 --> 00:11:29,989
I'm uncomfortable that I ran into you today.

219
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,560
Today,

220
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,229
I didn't want to see you either.

221
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,330
So let's just call it even and have some eel.

222
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,570
Since we both didn't want to see each other.

223
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,710
And your friend didn't ask me to come here.

224
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:49,909
I'm here because Auntie called me and told me to come by for some eel.

225
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,779
Auntie, I want my eel!

226
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,950
I'm grilling it now! Don't rush me.

227
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,550
I'm so embarrassed for you.

228
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,519
You know you totally overreacted, right?

229
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:04,159
Isn't he that Gong Chan who has a crush on you?

230
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:06,060
Yes.

231
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:08,399
I am that Gong Chan.

232
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,430
I see.

233
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:13,129
- He's good-looking. - Be quiet.

234
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:16,700
- I'm Chae Jun Hee. - Shut it.

235
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:19,639
My gosh.

236
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:23,310
- Get home safely! - Let's go.

237
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,028
I told you to finely chop the green onions.

238
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:43,700
I never told you to do such a clumsy job.

239
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,629
Good grief. You really are the bane of my existence.

240
00:12:48,739 --> 00:12:49,840
Hurry up!

241
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:03,220
To tell you the truth, I wanted to see you.

242
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,290
I lied earlier.

243
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,989
Your friend was right there,

244
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,659
and you said you wanted me out of your sight.

245
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:12,889
It hurt my feelings.

246
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,830
But I have to say,

247
00:13:18,369 --> 00:13:19,670
I'm happy to see you.

248
00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:24,940
Gosh. When I'm with you, I don't care about getting my pride crushed.

249
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,739
I wasn't like this when the ice store owner's daughter chased me.

250
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:33,609
"Ice store owner's daughter"?

251
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,349
At the fish market.

252
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,749
The ice store owner's youngest daughter was so popular.

253
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,090
Everyone called her "Ice Princess".

254
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:45,430
She had such a small, cute face.

255
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,629
Then go to your "Ice Princess". What are you doing here?

256
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,440
Seven billion dollars? Is it her?

257
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,379
Seven billion dollars?

258
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,920
Anyway, Professor Oh.

259
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,560
Why did you say you didn't want to see me today?

260
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,359
You seem upset.

261
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,800
I feel like my name has been rolling around...

262
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:31,869
on the ground like a piece of trash. Do you know what it's like?

263
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,809
Hey, isn't that Kim Dong Gu? When did he get out?

264
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,249
Don't look at him. His eyes give me the creeps.

265
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,479
Kim Dong Gu?

266
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,090
Don't even say that name. It'll bring us rotten luck.

267
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,129
But you were the one who told me about it.

268
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:57,600
The paper company in the Bahamas.

269
00:14:57,999 --> 00:15:00,430
Money was laundered through the paper company.

270
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,499
And your name is on the bank account.

271
00:15:03,499 --> 00:15:04,600
Oh Soo Jae.

272
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,639
I'm glad to have found out,

273
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,239
but I feel like...

274
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:14,310
you know something else about me now,

275
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,279
and I feel embarrassed again.

276
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:22,119
That's why I didn't want to see you.

277
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,489
I have something like that too.

278
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,930
In a way, I feel like I'd rather have it out in the open.

279
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,729
But at the same time, I want to keep it hidden forever.

280
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,269
You're not the only one who feels that way.

281
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,639
So once again, let's call it even.

282
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:47,409
Sometimes in life, you feel like only bad things are coming your way.

283
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,350
But if you wait a little and look around you,

284
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:54,550
you'll see that good things are happening.

285
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,790
And you'll see good people around you.

286
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:05,970
Good things...

287
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,670
and good people.

288
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,300
(Song Mi Rim)

289
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,009
(Song Mi Rim)

290
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:52,050
Hey.

291
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:56,350
Mr. Yoon Se Pil called me because he couldn't reach you.

292
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,519
He wants to move the 9am meeting to 8am.

293
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:00,950
He wants to meet for breakfast.

294
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:02,290
Okay.

295
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,840
(Snacks and Toast)

296
00:17:20,969 --> 00:17:22,139
Ms. Oh.

297
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,679
My gosh, they're so busy.

298
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,979
- Here you go. - One more ham and cheese, please.

299
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,009
Sure.

300
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,419
- Is this place good? - Try it and you'll see.

301
00:17:33,189 --> 00:17:35,119
- Great. Thank you. - Enjoy.

302
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,629
My gosh. It's delicious.

303
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,869
I came here every two days when I was studying for the bar exam.

304
00:17:46,969 --> 00:17:48,069
Every two days?

305
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,169
I couldn't afford to eat it every day.

306
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,769
Today, it's on me. Eat as much as you want.

307
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,369
How much is it anyway?

308
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,840
At least 1.8 billion dollars.

309
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,050
To be honest, it should be at least two billion dollars.

310
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,149
And what do I get in return?

311
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,418
Classified information that the phase-three clinical trial...

312
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:13,059
for Hansu Bio's new drug will be successful...

313
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,428
and that it'll be announced...

314
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:17,959
immediately after the merger.

315
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,539
You seem pleased, so here's another condition.

316
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,909
The retainer fee shall be 25 percent of the entire amount.

317
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,439
Oh, I'm sorry.

318
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,750
That kind of up-front payment is unheard of.

319
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,479
If people find out that I agreed to this, everyone will call me crazy.

320
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,079
If you're not up for it, don't do it.

321
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,618
But if rumours go around that you're crazy...

322
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:41,020
My gosh. It'll be great for marketing.

323
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:45,560
Okay, let's do this.

324
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,888
I can agree to 20 percent.

325
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:50,658
If we uncover any serious issues such as corruption...

326
00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:52,928
while conducting due diligence,

327
00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:55,539
Hansu Bio will have to return twice the amount to SP Partners,

328
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,000
and the agreement will be annulled.

329
00:18:57,899 --> 00:19:00,239
- Deal. - Before the remainder is due,

330
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,979
if Hansu Bio's stock price drops over eight percent...

331
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,609
for whatever reason,

332
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,178
Hansu Bio will have to return twice the amount to SP Partners,

333
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,449
and the agreement will be annulled. That's my condition.

334
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:11,350
Make it 15 percent.

335
00:19:12,389 --> 00:19:14,320
- No, 10 percent. - Make it 16.

336
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,060
Eleven.

337
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:17,990
Make it 17 percent.

338
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,530
You want Hansu to go belly up.

339
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,899
So making their stock drop that much will be a piece of cake for you.

340
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,869
Are you planning...

341
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,769
to make the stock price fall and run off with the doubled-up payment?

342
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,599
Hansu Construction has to pay off...

343
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,540
over 400 million dollars immediately.

344
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,138
However, Hansu's debt-to-equity ratio is over 500 percent,

345
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:38,780
so they can't find a bank that is willing to lend them money.

346
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,779
The company really needs the up-front payment.

347
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,080
Just accept my offer.

348
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,719
Make it 13 percent.

349
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,859
Deal.

350
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,060
One last condition.

351
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:58,458
The execution of the business sale agreement...

352
00:19:58,459 --> 00:20:00,669
involving Hansu Bio will be handled by lawyer Oh Soo Jae.

353
00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:06,040
So this deal can't go through without you? Is that it?

354
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:08,879
I can't let someone else take the fruit of my hard work.

355
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:12,849
I've been told that TK...

356
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,279
will get at least 70 million dollars once the deal goes through,

357
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,480
which is a very lucrative transaction for TK.

358
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,889
How much will you get for overseeing the entire procedure?

359
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:23,820
I want to say... Ten percent?

360
00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:26,959
Seven percent?

361
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,059
Why don't you join hands with us instead?

362
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,500
With us, you can get up to 20 percent. You have my word.

363
00:20:34,469 --> 00:20:36,369
No need, because I'll take everything anyway.

364
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,369
- Thank you. - Thank you.

365
00:20:40,469 --> 00:20:42,179
- Have a good day. - You too!

366
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,079
Mr. Kim.

367
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,408
A short-term borrowing of 200 million dollars...

368
00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:49,418
at Hansu Construction.

369
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:50,580
What will you do about it?

370
00:20:50,879 --> 00:20:52,320
Three years ago,

371
00:20:52,889 --> 00:20:55,519
you said you'd grow it to be...

372
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,490
the number one construction company in Korea once we acquired...

373
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:00,560
Daesung Construction.

374
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:04,159
The construction for Yeongpyeong District has kicked off,

375
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:06,830
and the stock price has been on the rise, sir.

376
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:10,968
But as for the short-term borrowings,

377
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,138
I'm hoping we'll soon have some surplus funds...

378
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:14,468
once the sale of Hansu Bio goes well.

379
00:21:14,469 --> 00:21:17,939
Hey, why is the sell-off any of your business?

380
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:21,010
Are you asking me to sell Hansu Bio to fill your deficit?

381
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,049
Now that the Yeongpyeong District project has kicked off,

382
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,820
you need to create a cash flow as the CEO of the company.

383
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,060
How dare you expect me to spoon-feed you?

384
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:32,260
- I apologize, sir. - Darn you useless morons.

385
00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:35,600
- Hey, Han Gi Taek. - Yes, sir.

386
00:21:35,699 --> 00:21:37,800
What are you doing? Try to use your brain a little.

387
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:39,330
I am, sir.

388
00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:43,869
When we're selecting our preferred bidder,

389
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,409
why don't we sign with the one with the most enticing offer?

390
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,780
Here's what I've gathered so far. Naeun Group, 1.1 billion dollars.

391
00:21:50,939 --> 00:21:52,509
H and T, 1.3 billion dollars.

392
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,079
SP Partners, 1.8 billion plus other incentives.

393
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,919
Up to two billion dollars, I'd say.

394
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,888
We'll select SP Partners as our preferred bidder...

395
00:21:59,889 --> 00:22:03,059
and request at least 20 percent for the up-front payment.

396
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,389
What? Twenty percent?

397
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:09,159
On the condition that the success of the phase-three clinical trial...

398
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:10,959
will be announced after the sell-off.

399
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:15,739
Are you crazy? Why let them reap all the benefits?

400
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,340
This is nuts. Hey, what are you thinking?

401
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,369
What is this?

402
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:25,678
"If any problem arises, Hansu will pay twice the amount,"

403
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,780
"and the agreement will be annulled"?

404
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,219
Goodness. Hey, read this over.

405
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:34,689
Hey, are you suggesting we throw 700 million dollars out the window?

406
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,919
Father, we could lose up to 800 million dollars.

407
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:41,659
Gi Taek, this is insane.

408
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:44,830
Is this a joke? Are you gullible or just incompetent?

409
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,429
This is way too risky.

410
00:22:47,969 --> 00:22:49,600
There will be no risk.

411
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,070
There will be no risk whatsoever.

412
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,439
But will Chairman Choi be okay with the conditions you suggested?

413
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,209
Now that I know about the bank account in my name,

414
00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:00,109
he'll have no choice.

415
00:23:00,709 --> 00:23:04,179
Lawyer Oh Soo Jae will handle it, backed by TK.

416
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,949
If anything goes wrong, we'll hold TK Law Firm accountable.

417
00:23:07,449 --> 00:23:10,188
The accounting firm will be hired by them,

418
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:12,529
so the 70 million dollars will initially go to TK.

419
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:15,859
If anything goes wrong, TK will pay back three times the commission.

420
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:18,800
So, 70 million times 3. That's 210 million dollars.

421
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,729
We'll make TK pay us 210 million dollars.

422
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,840
Well, I like that.

423
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,240
But these conditions are just too extreme.

424
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,139
Will Chairman Choi do it though?

425
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:31,539
Will that sly man agree to this,

426
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,810
knowing he might have to cough up 210 million dollars?

427
00:23:34,909 --> 00:23:36,520
You just need to make your decision, sir.

428
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:40,250
Ms. Oh will take care of SP Partners and TK.

429
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,260
You've already talked to Ms. Oh about this?

430
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,520
Yes, sir.

431
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,530
My goodness.

432
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:50,399
These conditions are just unheard of.

433
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:54,469
Gi Taek, I see that you used your brain for a change.

434
00:23:54,899 --> 00:23:58,269
However, Ms. Oh has to oversee...

435
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,409
all legal aspects of the sell-off as Hansu Bio's legal representative.

436
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,010
Who wants that? Ms. Oh?

437
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,109
Yes.

438
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,579
I told her it was a bit much, but...

439
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,350
Well, she's already doing that. So why not?

440
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:14,219
Sure, tell her that we'll put that in the agreement.

441
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:16,219
Yes, sir.

442
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,290
My goodness.

443
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,500
Just tell him that Hong Seok Pal is here.

444
00:24:26,629 --> 00:24:29,740
You'll have to call the secretary's office and make an appointment.

445
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:32,469
Tell Executive Secretary Ha Il Gu...

446
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,878
that Hong Seok Pal is here to speak with the chairman...

447
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:37,340
regarding Park So Young.

448
00:24:40,649 --> 00:24:42,580
Yes, a man named Hong Seok Pal is here.

449
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,080
Okay.

450
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:52,290
See? Why did you have to waste my time?

451
00:24:53,629 --> 00:24:55,060
Hello, good day.

452
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,109
Don't you know who I am?

453
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:22,990
You sound very charming today.

454
00:25:23,219 --> 00:25:25,520
It's okay. Just go back to your old ways.

455
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,530
Park So Young's cell phone.

456
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,030
Did someone order you to bring it to them?

457
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:34,230
Or did you steal it so you could keep it as insurance?

458
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:38,070
What's all this gibberish about now?

459
00:25:39,869 --> 00:25:42,138
Seeing how you had to come all the way here,

460
00:25:42,139 --> 00:25:44,009
I'm guessing your situation isn't so good now.

461
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:47,249
You can contact me if you ever need my help.

462
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:50,149
Oh, I'll bill you for my medical expenses, so be ready.

463
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,530
(Song Mi Rim)

464
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,469
You said you were close to Ms. An in the secretary's office.

465
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,869
Yes. We go out for a beer together from time to time.

466
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:13,510
Go there now. Pretend to be talking to her and monitor the situation.

467
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,739
You treated me last time. Today, it's on me.

468
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,208
- What do you feel like eating? - Well, how about gopchang?

469
00:26:20,209 --> 00:26:22,309
Let's just talk in your office.

470
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:25,649
Are we teenagers? Why do you want to talk in the restroom?

471
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:28,688
Aren't you busier now that Ms. Oh is teaching at the law school?

472
00:26:28,689 --> 00:26:31,790
Come on. I can still make time to have dinner with you.

473
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:36,158
Do you think you can scare me by saying that?

474
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,559
I swear, I'll expose everything.

475
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,968
So you'd better not ignore me!

476
00:26:40,969 --> 00:26:42,330
What are you looking at?

477
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:56,750
Ms. Oh, that man was fuming mad. He was shouting and yelling.

478
00:26:58,219 --> 00:27:00,050
Can you still not reach Mr. Ko?

479
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,590
No, it's been a few days.

480
00:27:12,669 --> 00:27:14,570
I need you guys to look into this man.

481
00:27:15,629 --> 00:27:16,999
It's been handed off to the prosecution,

482
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,600
but the investigation isn't going anywhere.

483
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,939
But you want us to look into it?

484
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,479
How?

485
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,679
Aren't you curious? I am curious.

486
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,448
Is there a personal reason?

487
00:27:27,449 --> 00:27:29,419
A reason you're intrigued...

488
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,319
or a reason you must find out?

489
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,319
- Of course. - What is the reason?

490
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,320
- I can't tell you. - Sorry?

491
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:38,760
So you want us to just shut our mouths and find out?

492
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:42,659
No, it's a deal. I'm proposing a deal.

493
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,459
If you're not interested, you can bow out.

494
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:47,129
If you're in, take turns and tell me what you want.

495
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,969
Once I graduate and pass the bar exam,

496
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:54,968
I'd like to work at TK.

497
00:27:54,969 --> 00:27:56,480
On your team.

498
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,708
Okay, if you score over 1,200 on the bar exam.

499
00:27:58,709 --> 00:28:01,810
Sorry? That is way too high.

500
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,519
- Could you make it 1,000? - Then 1,300.

501
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,649
Fine. 1,200, it is.

502
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,858
This NDA states that you must keep everything related to this...

503
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:13,428
strictly confidential.

504
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:16,099
Write down your condition on the last page and sign.

505
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,159
Okay.

506
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,399
(Score over 1,200 on the bar exam.)

507
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:24,300
If I ever need a lawyer, please help me at least once.

508
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,908
Are you planning to cause trouble?

509
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:27,570
No, of course not.

510
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,139
I'd never. My dream is to become President.

511
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,980
- That's quite a dream. - Nice and big, right?

512
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,979
I believe that everyone should dream big.

513
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,218
(Nam Chun Poong)

514
00:28:37,219 --> 00:28:39,619
I need your help with a case.

515
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:44,119
The case will go to trial. Please help me.

516
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,658
But you won't even tell me anything about the case?

517
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:48,859
I'll tell you when the time is right.

518
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:51,958
I mean, you're just saying that you're curious to find out...

519
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:54,469
who killed Park So Young,

520
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,840
without telling us what you're really after.

521
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,869
If I manage to find out who killed her,

522
00:29:00,409 --> 00:29:03,540
you'll have to grant my request too.

523
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,550
Can you pick up a cup of coffee for me?

524
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,790
Sure.

525
00:29:21,689 --> 00:29:23,199
I don't want you to be part of this.

526
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:25,428
- Why not? - It's better for you that way.

527
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:26,500
Why?

528
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,199
I guess someone I know is on your list of suspects?

529
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,340
I want to know who's on that list, but I know you won't tell me.

530
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,310
Let me ask you one thing.

531
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:41,780
Do you feel guilty about Park So Young's death?

532
00:29:43,179 --> 00:29:44,419
Do I feel guilty?

533
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,619
- No. - Then why are you doing this?

534
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,319
Why bother digging into this?

535
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,658
They're trying to sweep it under the rug,

536
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:53,830
so I believe the information will be useful to me.

537
00:29:55,389 --> 00:29:57,830
If the person I'm suspecting is really the culprit,

538
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,800
that's quite useful for me.

539
00:30:01,129 --> 00:30:02,369
Sometimes,

540
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,439
you feel very cold, Soo Jae.

541
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,139
I've been wondering if you've always been this way...

542
00:30:09,379 --> 00:30:12,909
or if working under my father changed you.

543
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:15,850
But what I know for sure is that the Soo Jae who used to tutor me...

544
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,849
was very different from the person you are now.

545
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,850
That was a long time ago.

546
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,389
People change.

547
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:22,689
That's true.

548
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:26,859
But I always find myself searching for the Soo Jae I knew back then.

549
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:31,600
She's still in there. The Soo Jae from the past is still in you.

550
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:35,929
You shouldn't be involved in this. It'll be better that way.

551
00:30:42,369 --> 00:30:44,740
Don't date Chan. That's my one condition.

552
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,550
What?

553
00:30:46,949 --> 00:30:48,379
I saw you two.

554
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,249
- Excuse me. - Yes?

555
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,719
- One bottle of soju, please. - Okay.

556
00:30:57,419 --> 00:30:59,020
I've never seen you smile...

557
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,330
like that before.

558
00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:04,260
I don't think you used to smile like that in the past.

559
00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:07,899
I didn't realize you could smile like that.

560
00:31:10,699 --> 00:31:11,899
Chan...

561
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,209
is a very interesting guy.

562
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,740
I always liked him.

563
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,580
I thought, gosh, he's a really good guy.

564
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,080
I actually wanted to be friends with this guy.

565
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,149
But at some point, he started to bug me.

566
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,619
Soo Jae.

567
00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:30,919
Do you like Chan?

568
00:31:33,429 --> 00:31:35,629
Do you like Chan as a guy? Do you?

569
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:39,469
If you're going to keep talking about useless things, leave.

570
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:42,469
I guess you're not sure yet.

571
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,639
That's a relief.

572
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,570
Don't forget what I said.

573
00:31:48,469 --> 00:31:49,939
Don't date Chan.

574
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,070
Yoon Sang.

575
00:32:13,929 --> 00:32:14,929
Hey.

576
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:19,040
I'm nervous about negotiating with Professor Oh on my own.

577
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:20,909
How was it?

578
00:32:21,669 --> 00:32:23,840
Everyone's been doing it, but nobody's saying how it goes.

579
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,449
You're good at being alone with her, aren't you?

580
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:29,679
See you.

581
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,589
Are you facing any pressure...

582
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,500
or problems related to the case?

583
00:32:46,469 --> 00:32:48,199
Are you wanting to take advantage of a weakness...

584
00:32:48,369 --> 00:32:51,840
of someone related to the case?

585
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,139
the suspect of the case?

586
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,139
Why do you think so?

587
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:00,949
Because...

588
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,879
I'm worried.

589
00:33:07,149 --> 00:33:08,320
What's your condition?

590
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:17,760
(Oh Soo Jae, Gong Chan)

591
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,129
I don't have any.

592
00:33:21,969 --> 00:33:23,300
(Non-Disclosure Agreement)

593
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,409
I'll keep your secret no matter what.

594
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:39,649
What is this?

595
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:42,959
Why does "no matter what" sound so romantic?

596
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,600
(Non-Disclosure Agreement)

597
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:57,439
That's why I got insurance. It pays 300,000 dollars when I die.

598
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,740
She said she wouldn't lend me money unless I got this insurance.

599
00:34:00,869 --> 00:34:04,609
Soo Jae is such a bad daughter.

600
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,679
I'm sorry, Mother.

601
00:34:07,409 --> 00:34:09,619
No, you're right.

602
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:13,049
She's my daughter, but I can't believe she came out of me.

603
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,559
Hi, Ms. Song. Is Soo Jae inside?

604
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,730
Yes, Ms. Yang. What brings you...

605
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,460
Ms. Song?

606
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,600
Are you Attorney Song Mi Rim of TK Law Firm?

607
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,999
Oh, yes. But who might you be...

608
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Me?

609
00:34:30,339 --> 00:34:33,468
I'm Attorney Min Young Bae's wife.

610
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:36,178
The guy who lost his shot to become managing partner of TK Law Firm...

611
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:37,880
because you betrayed him at the last minute.

612
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,710
I'm also the assistant director here. My name is Jung Hee Young.

613
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,250
I see.

614
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,449
So, it's not that I betrayed him.

615
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:51,789
He didn't understand his standing in the firm and expected too much...

616
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,428
You told me to get this insurance policy. What are you talking about?

617
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:56,500
I got the insurance policy.

618
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:02,028
You brat. Your brothers are at that fancy building of yours,

619
00:35:02,029 --> 00:35:05,170
and they're not going to move until you open the store for them.

620
00:35:05,569 --> 00:35:08,068
It seems she's been neglecting her family.

621
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:10,479
Please. You can't yell in here like that.

622
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,609
Let go of me. What kind of lawyer neglects her own family?

623
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,210
What kind of professor are you?

624
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,049
How can someone like you teach students?

625
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,088
Let go of me, Ms. Song. I'm going to end this here and now.

626
00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:27,259
I know that area well because I run a bar in front of that building.

627
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:30,129
I did a complete analysis...

628
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,600
of what type of store would be best for that area.

629
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:34,469
Who are you?

630
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:37,669
He's a student of Professor Oh's.

631
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,400
He has a natural talent for business.

632
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,270
He runs a store nearby,

633
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:44,239
and he's the owner of a building.

634
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:47,350
- Is that right? - Just come with me.

635
00:35:50,049 --> 00:35:51,750
Someone might call the police.

636
00:35:53,049 --> 00:35:55,549
The professors here are ex-prosecutors and ex-judges.

637
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,929
Okay. Let's go.

638
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:17,880
- Hello, sir. - Hi.

639
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,580
Gong Chan is so amiable.

640
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,020
I was about to intervene,

641
00:36:25,179 --> 00:36:27,150
but it was nice that he was able to kindly get her out of there.

642
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,219
Sorry, sir.

643
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:32,520
What do you mean? You did nothing wrong.

644
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,130
Anyway,

645
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,529
why are you trying to find it?

646
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,900
Anyway,

647
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,639
why are you trying to plead not guilty?

648
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,739
Because that's the correct answer.

649
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,139
I'm just trying to work toward the correct answer.

650
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:54,179
Because that's the correct answer.

651
00:36:55,509 --> 00:36:57,219
I'm just trying to work toward the correct answer.

652
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,619
Toward the correct answer?

653
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:03,719
You're trying to catch the man who killed Park So Young...

654
00:37:04,259 --> 00:37:08,060
with the help of the students at the legal clinic,

655
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,159
so you can head toward the correct answer?

656
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,569
Is it worth it?

657
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:18,699
Kim Dong Gu is not guilty. Is that the correct answer?

658
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,239
Is it worth it?

659
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,179
Just go with the flow.

660
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:27,149
Chief Prosecutor Choi...

661
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,509
is going to retire after this case.

662
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:32,679
He'll probably start his own law firm then.

663
00:37:32,779 --> 00:37:34,750
Just go with the flow, wrap up this case,

664
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,060
and go work at his law firm.

665
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:40,159
He'll make you a successful lawyer.

666
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,929
When will I be able to try...

667
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,169
going against the grain again...

668
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:50,869
if I don't do so now?

669
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:52,469
Do you have no other reasons?

670
00:37:54,409 --> 00:37:56,369
Do I need another reason?

671
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,980
Well, if that put it that way...

672
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:04,480
Gosh. I still have this habit from my prosecutor days.

673
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,089
I keep wondering if people have hidden agendas.

674
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,330
It's amazing, Ms. Oh.

675
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,130
Gong Chan's people skills are no joke.

676
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:24,839
Your mother became as gentle as a lamb.

677
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,610
I've never seen her concentrate so hard before.

678
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:30,940
She's completely absorbed in what Chan is saying, nodding along.

679
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:32,440
Gosh, Chan.

680
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,810
They're coming out. I'm going to hang up.

681
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,919
Hello, Mother.

682
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,420
Ms. Song. When did you get here? You should've come in.

683
00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:48,630
Goodness. Mr. Gong is the best.

684
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:51,429
He's a building owner and a business owner.

685
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,129
He's very successful.

686
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,928
Do you know what's even more amazing?

687
00:38:54,929 --> 00:38:56,900
He's going to let my sons open up a new location of his bar.

688
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,610
He's going to tell them everything. Business advice, recipes, and all.

689
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:02,209
You just need to make sure that your sons get...

690
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:05,079
work experience at the fish market for six months first.

691
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,278
No problem at all. I'll make sure they do so no matter what.

692
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:11,520
They went to prison for ten months before. Six months is nothing.

693
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:15,790
Oh, my. Pretend you didn't hear that.

694
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,159
Thank you for coming.

695
00:39:22,989 --> 00:39:24,399
How great.

696
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,459
I would take him to be my son-in-law...

697
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:29,900
in a heartbeat if Soo Jae was just ten years younger.

698
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:36,539
The company went through a rough patch...

699
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,480
with the delay of the sale.

700
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,448
SP Partners offered...

701
00:39:40,449 --> 00:39:44,249
the highest acquisition price to Hansu Bio,

702
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,949
and they were ultimately selected to be the acquirer.

703
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,218
Reporter Han.

704
00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:52,088
The Hansu Bio acquisition has become very interesting.

705
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:53,259
What are your thoughts on this?

706
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,329
Preferred bidders refer to companies...

707
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:57,258
that offered the most advantageous conditions...

708
00:39:57,259 --> 00:39:59,198
out of all the other bidders.

709
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:01,169
- So they will be given... - He's coming out!

710
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,900
the negotiation rights before the other bidders.

711
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,738
According to my sources in the industry,

712
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:08,769
SP Partners offered 2.1 billion dollars.

713
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:11,338
With this deal,

714
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:14,908
Hansu Bio's equity will go over three billion dollars.

715
00:40:14,909 --> 00:40:17,579
As of now, their debt-to-equity ratio is over 550 percent.

716
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:20,588
But it will be reduced by half.

717
00:40:20,589 --> 00:40:23,088
This is great news for Hansu Group.

718
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:24,889
I see. Ms. Shin.

719
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:26,859
TK Law Firm was involved in handling the sell-off.

720
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:31,459
Then is it safe to say the law firm also gained a lot from this?

721
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,528
Yes. That's right. TK Law Firm supervised the deal.

722
00:40:34,529 --> 00:40:36,738
And this was a nice example that showed its power.

723
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:38,838
Many law firms aggressively tried to win this account.

724
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:41,669
But TK Law Firm was the winner. And by handling this deal,

725
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:45,339
the law firm will receive a fee of over 70 million dollars.

726
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,480
This means that...

727
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:54,989
Did you see that? She seems so calm after making 70 million dollars.

728
00:40:55,089 --> 00:40:56,419
She can't be human.

729
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,988
Anyway, this is impressive.

730
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:59,928
She rules. Gosh. She got my respect too.

731
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:03,130
But Choi Ju Wan was the first-chair counsel in this sell-off.

732
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,060
That's just his title. Ms. Oh did all the work.

733
00:41:06,699 --> 00:41:08,729
I thought she would get pushed down after losing the position.

734
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,000
But she just got more ground with this case.

735
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:13,100
Come on. Get to work!

736
00:41:23,279 --> 00:41:24,420
Well done.

737
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:28,589
If there's a problem with this, we'll pay three times the fee.

738
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:30,889
Are you sure there's no risk with that condition?

739
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,529
Soo Jae...

740
00:41:35,989 --> 00:41:38,900
found out about the bank account under her name in the Bahamas.

741
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,670
When she took the files, that made me worry the most.

742
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,569
She found out in the end.

743
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:51,580
I'm sorry. I should have gotten that.

744
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,210
If she kicks her out, she will be the biggest traitor.

745
00:41:57,819 --> 00:41:59,779
But if we keep her in, she'll fight off 1,000 enemies.

746
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:03,589
So we must bring her in. That's the answer, isn't it?

747
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,659
Finalize your divorce and marry her.

748
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:13,000
- Father. - Do not defy me.

749
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:21,739
Here's the news about Hansu Group.

750
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:25,239
Chairman Han Sung Bum's bold leadership is in the limelight.

751
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,379
Chairman Han Sung Bum...

752
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,080
of Hansu Group's decision to proceed with the sell-off...

753
00:42:41,029 --> 00:42:42,229
If In Soo were to become the president,

754
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,799
who do you think will lead the world?

755
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:48,028
("Assemblyman Lee In Soo Is Ranked 1st in the Polls")

756
00:42:48,029 --> 00:42:49,900
("Chairman Han Sung Bum's Bold Decision to Sell Hansu Bio")

757
00:43:14,389 --> 00:43:15,759
Ms. Oh.

758
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:23,699
I was curious about you, so I always wanted to meet you.

759
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:25,339
And here we are.

760
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:27,469
Tell me your conditions.

761
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:30,179
Mediating them is my job.

762
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:33,750
Why don't we talk after work?

763
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,520
The highest alimony they can pay me.

764
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,219
And a public apology from Choi Ju Wan.

765
00:43:41,489 --> 00:43:42,888
Help him with his divorce.

766
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:45,889
My daughter-in-law wants custody and parental rights.

767
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:48,929
I can't let that happen.

768
00:43:49,529 --> 00:43:52,199
I heard you wanted custody and parental rights of your child.

769
00:43:53,869 --> 00:43:54,969
Was I misinformed?

770
00:43:57,739 --> 00:44:01,069
Goodness. Father couldn't even tell I was joking.

771
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:05,540
Why would I want custody and parental rights?

772
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,650
She's not even my child. Why would I want them?

773
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,329
Hey, Jae Yi.

774
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:23,600
Mom. I went to Grandma's grave.

775
00:44:23,799 --> 00:44:27,199
Good job. Your grandma must have been happy to see you.

776
00:44:27,369 --> 00:44:30,798
Mom. I'm sleeping with you tonight, right?

777
00:44:30,799 --> 00:44:33,040
You'll come and pick me up, right?

778
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,369
Yes. Of course. See you later.

779
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:44,319
She's smart and beautiful...

780
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:47,819
to the point that I wish I gave birth to her.

781
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,520
But you must have grown attached to her.

782
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,059
She must think you are her mother.

783
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,600
I lost my child because of Jae Yi.

784
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,000
Mighty.

785
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:06,139
I named my baby that, so my baby could be healthy in my womb.

786
00:45:07,509 --> 00:45:11,179
But one day, my doctor told me Mighty's heart wasn't beating.

787
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:13,679
When I found out about Jae Yi,

788
00:45:14,449 --> 00:45:17,650
I cried every day and threw up.

789
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,279
I couldn't even sleep.

790
00:45:19,549 --> 00:45:21,520
After spending two months like that...

791
00:45:22,949 --> 00:45:26,089
My baby died because of Jae Yi.

792
00:45:31,659 --> 00:45:33,830
But my father-in-law told me this.

793
00:45:36,969 --> 00:45:40,000
"I'll tell everyone that you gave birth to Jae Yi."

794
00:45:40,409 --> 00:45:42,170
"Wouldn't that be better for you too?"

795
00:45:47,009 --> 00:45:49,250
From time to time, my father-in-law...

796
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,080
acts like a sociopath.

797
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,020
Don't you agree?

798
00:45:55,989 --> 00:45:59,119
Choi Ju Wan has some of his genes, so he's the same.

799
00:46:02,489 --> 00:46:05,900
I lived my life pretending to be happy with those monsters.

800
00:46:07,069 --> 00:46:08,730
I want to stop now.

801
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:11,299
My life is too precious to waste.

802
00:46:15,509 --> 00:46:18,480
By the way, I'm really curious.

803
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:22,250
How did you open up to someone like Choi Ju Wan?

804
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:24,080
I know we just met.

805
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,889
But I can tell it won't be easy to win you over.

806
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:30,520
I paid attention to his background.

807
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:33,960
What about you?

808
00:46:35,389 --> 00:46:37,500
You do have your charm.

809
00:46:38,199 --> 00:46:40,299
I get why my father-in-law likes you.

810
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:45,069
This is our first day. So let's wrap up here.

811
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,210
Next time, let's discuss more realistic conditions in detail.

812
00:46:49,909 --> 00:46:51,279
Sure. Sounds good.

813
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:08,259
You can go there first. Ju Wan will follow you there.

814
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,860
Have a baby there and have a simple wedding.

815
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,049

818
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:46,929
Yes.

820
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:52,339
What's your baby's nickname?

821
00:47:52,969 --> 00:47:55,210
- Pardon? - You haven't gotten one yet?

822
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,480
You can tell us next time then.

823
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,679
Sky.

824
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:07,589
Sky? That's a beautiful name.

825
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,219
Yes.

826
00:48:21,429 --> 00:48:22,730
I had erased...

827
00:48:23,799 --> 00:48:25,270
that beautiful name from my head.

828
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,239
If I hadn't, I couldn't have survived.

829
00:48:29,869 --> 00:48:31,710
I didn't tell anyone.

830
00:48:33,009 --> 00:48:35,009
I wished no one would find out.

Come on. Be nice to her.

00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,019
Gosh. Stop introducing me to the women you date.

841
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,330
Aren't you even embarrassed?

842
00:49:54,889 --> 00:49:58,000
Ma'am. Don't trust my dad. You'll ruin your life.

843
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:02,330
Hey. You punk. Where are you going?

844
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:07,940
Hey.

845
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,139
Why don't you eat some meat before you go?

846
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:19,819
I hope...

847
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:22,750
you can be a good brother to my daughter, Na Jung.

848
00:50:46,779 --> 00:50:48,080
There's something...

849
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,750
I didn't tell you.

850
00:50:53,949 --> 00:50:55,589
I should have told you.

851
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,119
I wanted to tell you many times.

852
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,360
And I tried to tell you too.

853
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:07,000
But I couldn't.

854
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:10,170
But she had a stillbirth.

855
00:51:10,369 --> 00:51:13,269
When the man she thought would come didn't come for her,

856
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:15,139
she even tried to end her life.

857
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:19,979
That useless jerk. He's nothing but a disappointment.

858
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,479
My son was reckless for a night and got you pregnant.

859
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,580
And you used the pregnancy...

860
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,920
for your personal gain.

861
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,019
I let that slide.

862
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:30,020
I hate that people...

863
00:51:30,021 --> 00:51:32,489
who try to manipulate me, so I would do what they want...

864
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:37,029
are the only ones who know about it.

865
00:51:40,299 --> 00:51:42,730
I want a good person to know about it.

866
00:51:42,969 --> 00:51:46,239
What is it? Something happened to you. What happened?

867
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:55,080
I just want someone good to know about it.

868
00:51:57,719 --> 00:51:59,719
I just suddenly wanted to say that.

869
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:04,159
Jun Hee.

870
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:09,489
Can I share this secret with someone else?

871
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:11,529
Not you.

872
00:52:11,799 --> 00:52:13,630
Yes, you can. You totally can.

873
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:16,429
There are a lot of things I keep from you too.

874
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:20,739
I think he will just...

875
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:23,980
tell me it's okay.

876
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,980
I think he can make it look like it's not a big deal.

877
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:33,779
Can I share that with him?

878
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:36,749
I would be fine even if you never told me.

879
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:38,190
Just tell Gong Chan about it.

880
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,659
You have to tell him. Okay?

881

Park So Young.

887
00:54:15,089 --> 00:54:16,819
What if I killed her?

888
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,989
What?

889
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:26,130
Why? Did what I just said get your attention now?

890
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:29,129
I get it. You're partially responsible...

891
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:30,670
for the way she died.

892
00:54:30,739 --> 00:54:32,169

I heard it from the coordinator at Park So Young's OB-GYN clinic.

897
00:56:01,029 --> 00:56:04,159
She said the father of the baby was super rich.

898
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,729
Park So Young took a cab in front of the hostess bar.

899
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,198
And I confirmed that...

900
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:09,829
Hong Seok Pal took his car to follow her soon after.

901
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:11,799
For now, Hong Seok Pal is the prime suspect.

902

909
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:03,279
What?

910
00:58:03,449 --> 00:58:04,549
I wanted to...

911
00:58:05,279 --> 00:58:07,420
go to you.

912
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:12,159
Something happened, right?

913
00:58:13,819 --> 00:58:16,029
- Where are you? - Chan, where are you going?

914
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:26,469
If you don't know where you are, tell me what you see.

The owner of the hostess bar Park So Young worked at.

919
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:13,379
What if he didn't kill himself? Just like Park So Young,

920
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:15,619
what if it's murder disguised as suicide?

921
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,419
Do you think you're the only one who's worried about Soo Jae?
