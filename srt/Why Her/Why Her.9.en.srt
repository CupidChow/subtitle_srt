1
00:00:09,033 --> 00:00:11,603
(This is a work of fiction. All characters, places, incidents,)

2
00:00:11,604 --> 00:00:14,004
(and organizations portrayed in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:29,854 --> 00:00:33,093
Where's the closest bakery? I need to pick up a chocolate cake.

4
00:00:33,424 --> 00:00:35,864
A cake? Forget it.

5
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:38,503
The thing is...

6
00:00:38,504 --> 00:00:41,004
I hate stuff like that. Seriously, don't do it.

7
00:00:41,404 --> 00:00:42,404
What?

8
00:00:42,504 --> 00:00:45,044
Don't buy a cake. If you do, I won't go to your place.

9
00:00:45,974 --> 00:00:46,974
But...

10
00:00:50,714 --> 00:00:53,843
Hyung Chil likes a chocolate cake.

11
00:00:55,883 --> 00:00:58,724
If he doesn't get to have a chocolate cake on his birthday,

12
00:00:59,483 --> 00:01:01,394
he may pack up and move out.

13
00:01:06,623 --> 00:01:08,063
I'll get it.

14
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:11,504
Wait up. I'm buying it!

15
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:15,974
(Episode 9)

16
00:01:18,573 --> 00:01:19,674
Come on in.

17
00:01:50,474 --> 00:01:53,443
Professor Oh, don't worry about a thing and just stay here.

18
00:01:53,444 --> 00:01:55,374
We'll take good care of you.

19
00:01:56,144 --> 00:01:57,613
As soon as the sun goes down,

20
00:01:57,614 --> 00:02:00,513
I'll tie Chan up on the third floor.

21
00:02:00,644 --> 00:02:01,954
I got you!

22
00:02:02,853 --> 00:02:05,284
Don't assume that we won't charge you rent.

23
00:02:05,424 --> 00:02:06,853
We'll even charge you for all the food.

24
00:02:19,404 --> 00:02:20,404
Hey.

25
00:02:20,534 --> 00:02:22,504
Don't think about anything. Just stay there.

26
00:02:22,974 --> 00:02:25,274
Did you put a camera on the back of my head or something?

27
00:02:25,404 --> 00:02:27,403
Chan came to ask me about it.

28
00:02:27,404 --> 00:02:29,413
He said he wanted to have you stay at his place.

29
00:02:30,513 --> 00:02:31,784
This makes no sense.

30
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:34,683
I'll just stay at your place for a little while.

31
00:02:34,684 --> 00:02:36,313
No, he beat me.

32
00:02:36,314 --> 00:02:38,322
You can't stay at my place.

33
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:39,554
Hold on, Jun Hee. Wait.

34
00:02:43,923 --> 00:02:45,464
Did you meet Jun Hee?

35
00:02:46,823 --> 00:02:47,833
Yes.

36
00:02:49,534 --> 00:02:51,863
My gosh! Ms. Oh, I'm here.

37
00:02:53,434 --> 00:02:54,504
Oh, boy.

38
00:02:55,073 --> 00:02:56,274
Mi Rim?

39
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,573
Those are mine.

40
00:03:00,103 --> 00:03:02,843
That's right. I brought them from your place.

41
00:03:02,844 --> 00:03:04,513
I packed everything you'd need.

42
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:05,883
But why?

43
00:03:06,284 --> 00:03:10,413
Nice, look at that. I see that you followed my advice to a tee.

44
00:03:10,513 --> 00:03:13,624
I told them you'd absolutely need a home office...

45
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:16,194
with a nice desk and a comfortable chair.

46
00:03:16,293 --> 00:03:17,293
I also emphasized...

47
00:03:18,994 --> 00:03:21,993
that you'd need a big, comfortable couch.

48
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:26,103
Why? Because the couch is always your favorite place to sleep.

49
00:03:26,804 --> 00:03:29,673
My gosh, it's firm. This feels luxurious. It's so nice!

50
00:03:30,073 --> 00:03:31,143
Song Mi Rim.

51
00:03:37,913 --> 00:03:40,944
I want to renovate my building.

52
00:03:41,413 --> 00:03:42,553
Renovate?

53
00:03:42,554 --> 00:03:45,024
You want to renovate it? Why? How?

54
00:03:45,154 --> 00:03:46,624
So I can live there.

55
00:03:47,124 --> 00:03:48,754
The 2nd and 3rd floors can be my living space.

56
00:03:48,923 --> 00:03:51,163
The thing is, Professor Oh...

57
00:03:52,323 --> 00:03:56,463
Renovations can take a while. Right?

58
00:03:56,464 --> 00:03:59,563
Yes. To renovate 2 full floors... It could take up to 2 weeks.

59
00:03:59,564 --> 00:04:01,934
No, up to a month.

60
00:04:06,274 --> 00:04:07,344
Then...

61
00:04:08,974 --> 00:04:13,013
Could I stay here just until then?

62
00:04:15,513 --> 00:04:16,513
Yes.

63
00:04:19,453 --> 00:04:21,624
All right, then. It's time to party.

64
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:23,694
My birthday party?

65
00:04:24,823 --> 00:04:25,823
It's my birthday today!

66
00:04:27,624 --> 00:04:28,934
You're really something.

67
00:04:30,194 --> 00:04:31,763
Okay, all right.

68
00:04:32,304 --> 00:04:33,733
Professor Oh.

69
00:04:33,734 --> 00:04:36,503
You see this "On" button, right? Press this button.

70
00:04:36,504 --> 00:04:37,702
- You want me to do it? - Yes.

71
00:04:37,703 --> 00:04:39,504
- But... - Wait, hold on.

72
00:04:40,004 --> 00:04:42,614
In 1, 2, 3.

73
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,983
My gosh. Who prepared all this?

74
00:04:47,984 --> 00:04:49,414
- Me. - What?

75
00:04:50,854 --> 00:04:52,984
He prepares his own birthday party every year.

76
00:04:53,523 --> 00:04:54,593
Hyung Chil.

77
00:05:24,383 --> 00:05:26,323
- Let me pour you one. - Sure.

78
00:05:27,754 --> 00:05:31,194
I'm telling you. It was always such a headache.

79
00:05:31,924 --> 00:05:34,064
But Mr. Son kindly stepped in...

80
00:05:34,523 --> 00:05:37,734
and got it all sorted out using the Financial Services Commission.

81
00:05:37,763 --> 00:05:39,903
On top of that, he says he'll even help fund...

82
00:05:40,234 --> 00:05:42,174
the sell-off of Hansu Bio.

83
00:05:42,304 --> 00:05:44,903
I'm so relieved that I feel like I can even chew and digest stones.

84
00:05:46,403 --> 00:05:47,403
I'm glad.

85
00:05:47,544 --> 00:05:49,273
- Mr. Son. - Yes.

86
00:05:49,773 --> 00:05:51,783
- Let me pour you one. - My gosh, sir.

87
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,413
I'm truly obliged and honored, sir.

88
00:05:55,414 --> 00:05:56,914
Thank you.

89
00:05:57,614 --> 00:05:58,653
Chairman Choi.

90
00:05:59,254 --> 00:06:01,723
What did you do to discipline him back in high school?

91
00:06:01,924 --> 00:06:04,723
Look, the chairman of the FSC is on his knees now.

92
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,892
Hey, did he beat you up or something?

93
00:06:06,893 --> 00:06:07,994
No, not at all.

94
00:06:08,164 --> 00:06:10,763
Even back in school, he was always like...

95
00:06:10,864 --> 00:06:12,463
the epitome of perfection.

96
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:14,633
On top of being the best student in the entire school,

97
00:06:14,773 --> 00:06:16,673
he often scored the highest marks in the country.

98
00:06:16,674 --> 00:06:18,342
Then he entered Seojung Law School...

99
00:06:18,343 --> 00:06:19,842
and passed the bar with the highest score.

100
00:06:19,843 --> 00:06:23,444
There is no other man like him. He really is too perfect.

101
00:06:24,273 --> 00:06:25,483
Back in college too.

102
00:06:25,484 --> 00:06:27,814
Back then, there were two types of male students.

103
00:06:27,984 --> 00:06:29,782
Those who joined the pro-democracy movement...

104
00:06:29,783 --> 00:06:32,022
- and those who drank with girls. - That's right.

105
00:06:32,023 --> 00:06:35,823
But Tae Guk practically lived at the library.

106
00:06:36,254 --> 00:06:39,364
I'd go home and come back only to see him sitting at the same desk.

107
00:06:39,794 --> 00:06:41,832
Then he passed the bar exam with the highest score...

108
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,064
- at such a young age. - Right.

109
00:06:44,664 --> 00:06:46,462
Tae Guk. You know I truly look up to you, right?

110
00:06:46,463 --> 00:06:49,533
Hey, you're boring. What a nerd.

111
00:06:50,874 --> 00:06:52,702
Chairman Choi, the drinks are on you today.

112
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:53,973
- Sure. - Good.

113
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:56,473
Yes, come in.

114
00:07:00,114 --> 00:07:02,054
Hello, I'm Han Dong O.

115
00:07:02,153 --> 00:07:05,254
My gosh. Director Han is here.

116
00:07:05,823 --> 00:07:07,754
Sit down. Pour everyone a drink.

117
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:11,564
Please allow me to pour you one.

118
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,762
So you're now in charge of the sell-off instead of Gi Taek?

119
00:07:18,763 --> 00:07:21,064
Yes, sir. I look forward to your guidance.

120
00:07:22,773 --> 00:07:24,633
I'll do my best, sir.

121
00:07:26,604 --> 00:07:27,973
- Here, let me pour you one. - Yes, sir.

122
00:07:29,944 --> 00:07:32,614
You're very good-looking.

123
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:36,913
What's with the Deputy Prime Minister?

124
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:41,753
How dare he pat my son on the shoulder? That jerk.

125
00:07:41,754 --> 00:07:44,323
Oh, boy.

126
00:07:48,864 --> 00:07:51,133
You're late, Your Majesty.

127
00:07:51,194 --> 00:07:54,504
Were you too busy looking after your subjects?

128
00:07:57,174 --> 00:07:59,642
The meeting with my campaign office staff ran late.

129
00:07:59,643 --> 00:08:01,873
You look like you had a drink or two already.

130
00:08:01,874 --> 00:08:03,143
Yes, I did.

131
00:08:08,914 --> 00:08:10,713
What did the Deputy Prime Minister say?

132
00:08:10,953 --> 00:08:13,383
Did Mr. Son say he'd help us out too?

133
00:08:13,924 --> 00:08:15,022
Yes.

134
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:17,854
You need not worry, Your Majesty.

135
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:21,164
Just focus on improving your approval ratings.

136
00:08:23,763 --> 00:08:25,333
I'm already so frustrated...

137
00:08:25,864 --> 00:08:28,632
because my ratings won't go up.

138
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,033
When will the sell-off be completed?

139
00:08:31,703 --> 00:08:34,472
Must I worry about that too?

140
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:37,743
Why would you waste your time worrying about that?

141
00:08:38,243 --> 00:08:41,483
Have I ever made you worry about money?

142
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:46,553
I had to call my dear son here...

143
00:08:46,554 --> 00:08:48,923
to make him pour drinks for those scumbags,

144
00:08:48,924 --> 00:08:51,253
curry favor with them, and fawn over them!

145
00:08:51,424 --> 00:08:52,863
What's your problem?

146
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:01,804
Oh, dear.

147
00:09:03,473 --> 00:09:05,774
Forgive me for my rudeness, Your Majesty.

148
00:09:06,944 --> 00:09:09,243
I'm sorry. Darn it.

149
00:09:10,343 --> 00:09:11,414
Oh, boy.

150
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,654
This is all Gi Taek's fault. That moron.

151
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:40,703
Both of you need to help me with everything you've got.

152
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:44,843
I must win the election for you to be appointed Minister of Justice.

153
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:48,213
I never wanted that title.

154
00:09:50,554 --> 00:09:53,953
Your rating is at a standstill now, but it's still the highest.

155
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:58,164
Do you think you achieved it on your own?

156
00:10:00,363 --> 00:10:02,894
The ruling party's failed policies.

157
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:04,904
The incompetent opposition party's internal conflict.

158
00:10:05,103 --> 00:10:09,072
On top of that, your most dangerous rival An Kang Won...

159
00:10:09,073 --> 00:10:10,274
is now out of the picture.

160
00:10:11,603 --> 00:10:14,702
Before we dealt with him, your rating was...

161
00:10:14,703 --> 00:10:18,284
only nine percent. Have you already forgotten all about it?

162
00:10:19,914 --> 00:10:23,154
Who got rid of An Kang Won for you?

163
00:10:25,453 --> 00:10:28,253
And Hong Seok Pal, who was making such a fuss.

164
00:10:29,524 --> 00:10:30,993
Who got rid of him for you?

165
00:10:31,623 --> 00:10:34,963
We have cleaners who take care of dirtbags like him.

166
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,603
I took care of it exactly as you said.

167
00:10:39,934 --> 00:10:41,904
"Have the cleaners take care of the dirtbags."

168
00:10:42,103 --> 00:10:43,603
I beg to differ, Chairman Choi.

169
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:47,603
There was something else I said.

170
00:10:47,944 --> 00:10:49,612
She will destroy him,

171
00:10:49,613 --> 00:10:51,274
and we should get rid of the cleaner too.

172
00:10:53,483 --> 00:10:55,953
I told you to get rid of Oh Soo Jae.

173
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,483
So why Han Gi Taek?

174
00:11:01,024 --> 00:11:02,394
Why did you do that?

175
00:11:26,483 --> 00:11:28,284
What is this about?

176
00:11:28,353 --> 00:11:30,212
The video Hong Seok Pal made.

177
00:11:30,213 --> 00:11:32,482
I just wanted to let you know that it's in my possession,

178
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,524
safe and sound.

179
00:11:38,223 --> 00:11:41,764
You're keeping what should've been destroyed?

180
00:11:44,493 --> 00:11:46,233
Tell me what it is that you want.

181
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:47,833
What do you want?

182
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:51,743
The Minister of Justice title won't be enough for you?

183
00:11:52,804 --> 00:11:53,843
No.

184
00:11:57,973 --> 00:11:59,414
Prime Minister in a parliamentary system.

185
00:12:02,753 --> 00:12:05,483
Push for constitutional reform as soon as you take office.

186
00:12:06,284 --> 00:12:08,924
You will install a parliamentary system.

187
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:12,394
Eighty percent of Koreans are calling for constitutional change,

188
00:12:12,993 --> 00:12:14,863
and over 70 percent of Koreans agree...

189
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:18,434
that we should move away from the current presidential system.

190
00:12:20,463 --> 00:12:23,333
If you announce that you plan to install a parliamentary system,

191
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:27,243
your ratings will snap out of the limbo and go through the roof.

192
00:12:37,054 --> 00:12:38,953
When you're too ambitious,

193
00:12:43,424 --> 00:12:46,463
you're bound to lose even the things that you can have.

194
00:12:47,493 --> 00:12:49,863
Don't you think that your dreams are too grand?

195
00:12:50,034 --> 00:12:53,934
No one even knew your name ten years ago. And look at you now.

196
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,073
You inspired me to dream big.

197
00:12:57,674 --> 00:12:59,843
Besides, no dream is too big.

198
00:13:09,384 --> 00:13:11,313
Congratulations, Professor Oh!

199
00:13:11,314 --> 00:13:13,123
I knew you'd be released.

200
00:13:13,223 --> 00:13:15,694
It must've been so stressful. Please look after your health.

201
00:13:15,993 --> 00:13:17,623
I'm getting teary-eyed!

202
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:20,222
Come back soon and show every professor and student...

203
00:13:20,223 --> 00:13:22,794
who spoke ill of you. Teach them a lesson.

204
00:13:24,564 --> 00:13:26,134
But Soo Jae isn't picking up.

205
00:13:27,003 --> 00:13:28,674
Is she not feeling well?

206
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:35,544
(Gong Chan)

207
00:13:42,853 --> 00:13:46,424
Hey, Professor Oh will stay at my place for the time being.

208
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,524
Her place isn't safe.

209
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,322
You're okay, right?

210
00:13:50,323 --> 00:13:51,963
Why ask about me?

211
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:55,164
He's making me feel worse.

212
00:13:58,064 --> 00:14:00,404
The building belonged to my father's company.

213
00:14:02,703 --> 00:14:04,533
In a seven-year-old kid's eyes,

214
00:14:04,534 --> 00:14:08,174
my dad was the coolest man on the planet because he built it.

215
00:14:09,914 --> 00:14:12,384
But when I was 18, it became someone else's.

216
00:14:16,654 --> 00:14:19,983
My dad was too nice and gullible.

217
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:23,353
His business went bust overnight.

218
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,694
He cried every day on the rooftop.

219
00:14:39,603 --> 00:14:40,644
Gosh.

220
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,784
I hated it because it made me so sad.

221
00:14:50,914 --> 00:14:52,554
I hated him for looking weak.

222
00:14:55,453 --> 00:14:57,493
That was when I told myself...

223
00:14:58,794 --> 00:15:01,093
that I'd never lose.

224
00:15:02,934 --> 00:15:04,733
And that I'd beat everyone.

225
00:15:06,664 --> 00:15:08,164
Then when did you buy it back?

226
00:15:10,404 --> 00:15:11,873
Three years ago.

227
00:15:12,843 --> 00:15:15,544
The owner refused to sell it, so I paid twice the market price.

228
00:15:16,174 --> 00:15:17,843
And it was worth every penny.

229
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,884
The day the ownership was transferred to my name,

230
00:15:23,253 --> 00:15:25,583
I sat exactly where my dad used to sit...

231
00:15:26,823 --> 00:15:28,123
and bragged about it.

232
00:15:29,753 --> 00:15:31,123
"Look, Dad."

233
00:15:33,723 --> 00:15:35,733
"I told you I'd get it back."

234
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,174
"I told you that I'd beat them all."

235
00:15:46,103 --> 00:15:47,243
That's really cool.

236
00:15:48,774 --> 00:15:50,973
How could someone be this cool?

237
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,482
The government has announced...

238
00:15:58,483 --> 00:16:01,183
that a support fund of two billion dollars...

239
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:04,323
will be established to help companies that are struggling.

240
00:16:04,623 --> 00:16:07,023
At the emergency fund policy meeting held earlier today,

241
00:16:07,024 --> 00:16:10,134
they announced a new program set up to help facilitate asset sales.

242
00:16:10,463 --> 00:16:13,332
The government will purchase real estate properties and ships...

243
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,003
owned by companies to help them...

244
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:19,373
Hansu will make money off of their rotten boats.

245
00:16:19,503 --> 00:16:21,973
As for his funeral, he was cremated.

246
00:16:23,073 --> 00:16:25,883
His mother wasn't happy about burning his body again...

247
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,414
Mr. Ha, how old are you now?

248
00:16:29,213 --> 00:16:31,683
I am ten years your junior, sir.

249
00:16:31,684 --> 00:16:32,983
Are you going through male menopause?

250
00:16:33,823 --> 00:16:35,394
You talk to yourself often these days.

251
00:16:36,694 --> 00:16:39,694
Has your son been in the hospital for ten years already?

252
00:16:41,164 --> 00:16:43,664
Yes, sir. If it weren't for you,

253
00:16:45,093 --> 00:16:47,064
he'd already be dead.

254
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:52,044
I apologize, sir. I was being too chatty.

255
00:16:59,414 --> 00:17:03,314
What? Professor Oh is staying at your house? Really?

256
00:17:04,253 --> 00:17:07,283
Yes. Just until she finishes renovating her building.

257
00:17:07,284 --> 00:17:09,292
But why your house of all places?

258
00:17:09,293 --> 00:17:11,123
She could go stay with her friends or her mother.

259
00:17:11,124 --> 00:17:13,663
And there are hotels too. So why? Just why?

260
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:17,194
What do you mean, why? It makes total sense to me.

261
00:17:17,664 --> 00:17:19,963
Same here. I'd stay there too, if I were her.

262
00:17:20,463 --> 00:17:22,802
What's with this reaction? You're both cool about it?

263
00:17:22,803 --> 00:17:25,174
Are you trying to make me look like a weirdo here?

264
00:17:27,273 --> 00:17:29,374
Hold on. I'm suddenly so confused right now.

265
00:17:29,644 --> 00:17:32,584
Am I too old-fashioned? What is this?

266
00:17:32,713 --> 00:17:34,712
Come on, dinosaur. I'll buy you lunch. Let's go.

267
00:17:34,713 --> 00:17:37,812
Hold on. I'm not that old-fashioned.

268
00:17:37,813 --> 00:17:40,252
- Bye, guys. - Bye.

269
00:17:40,253 --> 00:17:42,253
(We're only open until 10pm today.)

270
00:17:48,493 --> 00:17:49,563
It's Chan again, right?

271
00:17:50,864 --> 00:17:53,263
Tell him I will kill him if he sends another message.

272
00:17:53,404 --> 00:17:56,874
He thinks that he's the only one looking out for her.

273
00:17:57,634 --> 00:18:01,604
We're doing this to make sure Professor Oh can sleep well.

274
00:18:11,384 --> 00:18:12,884
They're cute.

275
00:18:14,154 --> 00:18:15,424
(Yoon Sang)

276
00:18:16,793 --> 00:18:20,164
I am leaving the Legal Clinic Center due to personal reasons.

277
00:18:20,263 --> 00:18:22,094
I'll always be rooting for you guys.

278
00:18:26,164 --> 00:18:27,664
Did you see this?

279
00:18:31,104 --> 00:18:34,143
Is it because Chairman Choi was on our list of suspects?

280
00:18:34,144 --> 00:18:37,614
On top of that, we suspected his brother as well.

281
00:18:37,713 --> 00:18:41,043
I thought it was all over. I had no idea we'd be hit with this.

282
00:18:52,223 --> 00:18:53,324
How is Soo Jae doing?

283
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:55,062
She's okay.

284
00:18:55,063 --> 00:18:56,594
You told her everything, right?

285
00:18:57,493 --> 00:18:58,533
Yes.

286
00:18:58,664 --> 00:19:01,333
You went through Mr. Ha's desk with Yoon Sang?

287
00:19:01,334 --> 00:19:04,003
Then he called Mr. Ha...

288
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:06,404
and told him to tell his father.

289
00:19:06,743 --> 00:19:08,303
My father will make a move soon.

290
00:19:09,013 --> 00:19:10,914
Then we wouldn't have to disclose this right away.

291
00:19:12,243 --> 00:19:13,513
Give it to her when she's out.

292
00:19:14,844 --> 00:19:17,213
Did you give that thing to Soo Jae?

293
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,453
I moved back in with my father.

294
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:24,453
When I moved out, I told myself I'd never go back.

295
00:19:26,424 --> 00:19:28,394
But now that my father has leverage over me,

296
00:19:29,594 --> 00:19:31,334
I had no choice but to back down and move back in.

297
00:19:32,063 --> 00:19:33,903
Since I already had to back down,

298
00:19:33,904 --> 00:19:35,733
I'm thinking I should just inherit the company.

299
00:19:35,973 --> 00:19:37,703
So I'm planning to intern at TK,

300
00:19:38,743 --> 00:19:39,944
under Soo Jae.

301
00:19:43,074 --> 00:19:44,114
Anyway, I'm off.

302
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:47,184
Yoon Sang.

303
00:19:49,713 --> 00:19:51,483
Come over to my place for dinner.

304
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,384
You can do that, right?

305
00:19:55,453 --> 00:19:57,523
- I don't want to. - Why not?

306
00:19:57,753 --> 00:19:59,624
I don't want to see Soo Jae...

307
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,063
at your place. I'm not going.

308
00:20:30,223 --> 00:20:33,723
I've never seen Ms. Oh so sound asleep.

309
00:20:34,694 --> 00:20:35,894
Let's go downstairs.

310
00:21:14,033 --> 00:21:17,472
Ms. Oh, Gi Taek's chief legal officer position is now vacant.

311
00:21:17,473 --> 00:21:19,874
I'll give it to you, so come and work for me.

312
00:21:20,144 --> 00:21:21,444
Hello, this is Lee In Soo.

313
00:21:22,243 --> 00:21:25,983
I'd like you to join my campaign team as the spokesperson.

314
00:21:26,384 --> 00:21:27,543
Please give me a call.

315
00:21:52,703 --> 00:21:54,144
Are you feeling better now?

316
00:21:54,844 --> 00:21:56,543
The heat was killing me.

317
00:22:05,013 --> 00:22:06,583
It's too late for a meal.

318
00:22:06,584 --> 00:22:08,354
Right? It's pretty late, isn't it?

319
00:22:08,753 --> 00:22:12,493
But Dr. Chae told me you should eat before going to sleep.

320
00:22:14,824 --> 00:22:17,434
I had no idea Jun Hee and Mi Rim stopped by.

321
00:22:20,563 --> 00:22:21,763
I picked them up on my way here.

322
00:22:24,773 --> 00:22:27,144
Hey, let her just eat. Don't do anything else.

323
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,273
I caught it on my way here.

324
00:22:33,713 --> 00:22:35,884
The sun went down a long time ago.

325
00:22:43,223 --> 00:22:44,594
It's nice.

326
00:22:46,293 --> 00:22:47,394
This house.

327
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:50,394
This rooftop.

328
00:22:51,493 --> 00:22:53,104
The stew you cooked for me.

329
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:56,173
Your friends who came by with more ingredients.

330
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:58,773
The second-floor room you and your friends set up.

331
00:23:01,303 --> 00:23:02,713
When I'm here,

332
00:23:04,273 --> 00:23:07,944
I'm able to forget about bad people or unhappy incidents.

333
00:23:17,493 --> 00:23:21,223
I know that staying here isn't right.

334
00:23:24,094 --> 00:23:25,634
But I'm staying because I like it here.

335
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:29,973
I like it a lot.

336
00:23:40,783 --> 00:23:42,084
Should we dig in?

337
00:24:18,953 --> 00:24:20,124
Ma'am!

338
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:24,924
This is for you.

339
00:24:28,664 --> 00:24:29,834
Mom.

340
00:24:35,104 --> 00:24:37,104
(Cause of Action)

341
00:24:44,444 --> 00:24:46,144
The highest alimony...

342
00:24:46,213 --> 00:24:49,713
and a public apology from Choi Ju Wan were my conditions.

343
00:24:50,483 --> 00:24:53,753
I told you that I would only focus on the alimony.

344
00:24:53,983 --> 00:24:57,293
If I only focus on the alimony, will they pay me as much as I want?

345
00:24:57,523 --> 00:24:59,563
If you give me a weapon, yes.

346
00:25:00,493 --> 00:25:02,223
I didn't know I had a weapon.

347
00:25:03,033 --> 00:25:04,763
When you were in the US,

348
00:25:04,993 --> 00:25:08,003
you met with a divorce lawyer.

349
00:25:08,963 --> 00:25:10,703
Not just once. But multiple times.

350
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:13,174
Mr. Choi Ju Wan hit the bottle, slept with women,

351
00:25:14,144 --> 00:25:16,644
and was hooked on drugs once too.

352
00:25:17,374 --> 00:25:18,973
His dirty past...

353
00:25:19,614 --> 00:25:21,813
became your weapon.

354
00:25:23,213 --> 00:25:26,424
And if you wanted, you had a chance...

355
00:25:26,684 --> 00:25:28,983
to get all the files on his computer.

356
00:25:30,594 --> 00:25:31,894
Life...

357
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:34,563
is fun, isn't it?

358
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:40,533
These unbearable moments became my weapon.

359
00:25:46,104 --> 00:25:47,574
I'm still thinking...

360
00:25:47,973 --> 00:25:51,444
about how I'm going to break the news to her.

361
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,783
Could you do that for me?

362
00:25:57,513 --> 00:26:00,084
Mom! Come here, Mom.

363
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:02,223
Come and take a photo with me.

364
00:26:13,164 --> 00:26:14,703
In 1, 2, 3.

365
00:26:18,334 --> 00:26:19,803
She wants that much money?

366
00:26:20,243 --> 00:26:21,303
Yes.

367
00:26:22,644 --> 00:26:24,273
Ms. Im Seung Yeon is quite extravagant.

368
00:26:25,414 --> 00:26:28,414
I thought she was modest, but she was hiding a mean punch.

369
00:26:35,023 --> 00:26:36,324
(Petition for Divorce)

370
00:26:36,493 --> 00:26:40,293
(Cause of Action)

371
00:26:40,723 --> 00:26:41,894
Come on in.

372
00:26:44,694 --> 00:26:45,733
Father.

373
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:50,473
Seung Yeon is asking quite a lot.

374
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:54,574
Surprisingly, that woman is quite extravagant.

375
00:26:55,043 --> 00:26:56,944
Or I'm wondering...

376
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:59,243
if Soo Jae is trying to make me suffer more from this.

377
00:27:01,114 --> 00:27:02,584
Oh, right.

378
00:27:03,813 --> 00:27:05,712
She must be upset with you too.

379
00:27:05,713 --> 00:27:07,753
When she was locked up in the detention center,

380
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:10,753
instead of trying to help her, you tried to kick her out.

381
00:27:10,854 --> 00:27:12,453
If you're drunk, get out.

382
00:27:13,094 --> 00:27:14,823
Let's talk tomorrow when you're sober.

383
00:27:14,824 --> 00:27:18,063
Father. I have a question.

384
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:21,334
It's about Hong Seok Pal.

385
00:27:24,604 --> 00:27:26,703
The whole world could come to an end.

386
00:27:26,844 --> 00:27:28,803
But he would do anything to survive.

387
00:27:29,374 --> 00:27:32,513
And he would hold on to his money and never let himself die.

388
00:27:33,384 --> 00:27:36,184
But he committed suicide.

389
00:27:36,213 --> 00:27:38,384
And Soo Jae was at the scene.

390
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,223
But Han Gi Taek helped him with the suicide plan.

391
00:27:42,993 --> 00:27:45,292
Soo Jae who was accused of instigating murder...

392
00:27:45,293 --> 00:27:46,792
came back, acquitted.

393
00:27:46,793 --> 00:27:49,834
And what happened reminded me of this.

394
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:53,503
You know, a marionette.

395
00:27:56,033 --> 00:27:57,334
I'm really curious...

396
00:27:57,604 --> 00:28:00,404
about the owner of the hands that are controlling the puppet.

397
00:28:03,414 --> 00:28:04,874
I thought you would know.

398
00:28:05,243 --> 00:28:07,684
You're asking me the question you should be asking the dead man.

399
00:28:11,253 --> 00:28:14,883
Right? Hong Seok Pal did what he wanted, right?

400
00:28:14,884 --> 00:28:16,053
That's it, right?

401
00:28:16,723 --> 00:28:17,793
I knew it.

402
00:28:18,924 --> 00:28:20,924
You know everything, Father.

403
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:24,033
You have my respect.

404
00:28:24,594 --> 00:28:25,634
You.

405
00:28:27,063 --> 00:28:28,834
Does Seung Yeon have something on you?

406
00:28:30,574 --> 00:28:33,803
If she's asking this much, it means she has something on you.

407
00:28:34,473 --> 00:28:36,114
And Soo Jae must have that.

408
00:28:37,444 --> 00:28:40,084
What does she have? Was there a woman?

409
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:03,733
Do you want a drink?

410
00:29:06,303 --> 00:29:09,203
Let's have a drink to celebrate that we're on the same boat.

411
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:12,543
I think this is the first time.

412
00:29:14,114 --> 00:29:16,614
I guess we are brothers, after all.

413
00:29:17,414 --> 00:29:18,654
What do you mean?

414
00:29:19,723 --> 00:29:23,053
You and I want an answer to the same question.

415
00:29:23,953 --> 00:29:26,262
(Thank you for coming today. We'll see you tomorrow.)

416
00:29:26,263 --> 00:29:29,864
(Tasanjiseok)

417
00:29:36,773 --> 00:29:38,203
- You're back. - Yes.

418
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,843
- Did you eat? - No, I haven't eaten yet.

419
00:29:41,844 --> 00:29:44,273
My gosh. Let me whip up something quick for you.

420
00:29:44,414 --> 00:29:46,042
No, I'm okay.

421
00:29:46,043 --> 00:29:47,483
No. We have some food left.

422
00:29:47,644 --> 00:29:48,713
What?

423
00:29:49,384 --> 00:29:51,053
Is she a regular there?

424
00:29:55,184 --> 00:29:56,253
Let's go inside.

425
00:29:58,924 --> 00:30:00,624
What is he doing there?

426
00:30:03,733 --> 00:30:07,063
(Tasanjiseok)

427
00:30:07,164 --> 00:30:08,503
My gosh.

428
00:30:08,733 --> 00:30:12,033
Professor Oh is no joke. Look at her crazy control.

429
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:14,944
Oh, my.

430
00:30:15,273 --> 00:30:16,374
There.

431
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:20,844
What was that?

432
00:30:23,654 --> 00:30:24,983
Were you a gangster?

433
00:30:26,884 --> 00:30:29,723
I just want you to know that I was a real gangster.

434
00:30:32,424 --> 00:30:34,522
My gosh. What?

435
00:30:34,523 --> 00:30:35,694
- Go. - Hold on.

436
00:30:36,164 --> 00:30:38,563
No!

437
00:30:44,273 --> 00:30:45,803
You're dead meat. How dare you?

438
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:52,374
- What are you doing? You lunatic. - One more punch.

439
00:30:52,674 --> 00:30:54,983
Do you have a death wish? Come on.

440
00:30:58,114 --> 00:31:00,283
I lost because of you!

441
00:31:02,023 --> 00:31:03,023
Hey.

442
00:31:05,753 --> 00:31:08,594
What did you just do to Professor Oh?

443
00:31:09,094 --> 00:31:11,094
I told you to stay away after sundown.

444
00:31:12,063 --> 00:31:13,962
He's giving us no choice. We should pull him out.

445
00:31:13,963 --> 00:31:16,232
- No. The game... - I'm sorry.

446
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:18,373
- We need to educate him better. - Wait.

447
00:31:18,374 --> 00:31:21,143
- We'll teach you a lesson. - We were just playing the game.

448
00:31:21,144 --> 00:31:23,513
You punk! How...

449
00:31:25,773 --> 00:31:28,444
What? That again?

450
00:31:28,644 --> 00:31:30,712
This is a serious disorder.

451
00:31:30,713 --> 00:31:32,313
I assure you I'm right this time.

452
00:31:32,453 --> 00:31:35,253
Soo Jae went into a bar her student runs late at night.

453
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:39,022
When I drove by this morning, her car was still parked there.

454
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:42,124
She probably got drunk and took a cab home.

455
00:31:42,394 --> 00:31:44,934
I saw her come out of the bar this morning.

456
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:50,134
(Tasanjiseok)

457
00:31:52,003 --> 00:31:53,042
It looked like...

458
00:31:53,043 --> 00:31:54,973
she rented out a room on the second floor or something.

459
00:31:55,203 --> 00:31:56,242
Really?

460
00:31:56,243 --> 00:31:59,884
When she attends the meeting later, I'm going to bring this up.

461
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:02,983
I would love to see that flustered look on her face.

462
00:32:03,384 --> 00:32:05,354
That's right. I live there.

463
00:32:06,953 --> 00:32:08,453
I'm sure you all know...

464
00:32:08,783 --> 00:32:11,153
that my house and office were searched by the police.

465
00:32:11,154 --> 00:32:13,693
I didn't want to stay there, knowing it was ransacked by the police.

466
00:32:13,694 --> 00:32:16,163
It's owned by the firm anyway, so I packed up and moved out.

467
00:32:16,164 --> 00:32:17,962
But still. You're staying at your student's house?

468
00:32:17,963 --> 00:32:19,533
A male student at that.

469
00:32:19,803 --> 00:32:22,164
Hey, do you realize that it looks...

470
00:32:22,303 --> 00:32:25,133
You're a female professor, and he's your student.

471
00:32:25,134 --> 00:32:27,643
It's absurd. Am I the only one who thinks it's absurd?

472
00:32:27,644 --> 00:32:30,873
Well, if weird rumors were to spread...

473
00:32:30,874 --> 00:32:33,713
It's certainly gossip-worthy.

474
00:32:33,844 --> 00:32:37,413
I'm afraid the students will talk about it.

475
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:39,213
Youngsters these days aren't afraid to speak up.

476
00:32:39,723 --> 00:32:43,052
I own a building in the area, but I'm renovating it at the moment.

477
00:32:43,053 --> 00:32:46,492
It's close to school, and I can stop by my building often to check in.

478
00:32:46,493 --> 00:32:49,664
He was going to rent it out anyway, so I told him I'd stay there.

479
00:32:50,634 --> 00:32:51,694
What's absurd about it?

480
00:32:52,793 --> 00:32:55,033
What are you all imagining?

481
00:32:56,033 --> 00:32:57,232
Are you a teenage girl?

482
00:32:57,233 --> 00:32:58,773
What? A teenage girl?

483
00:32:59,973 --> 00:33:02,373
Are you paying rent? How much?

484
00:33:02,374 --> 00:33:04,674
Did you ask for a discount using the fact that you're his professor?

485
00:33:05,013 --> 00:33:06,812
Would you like to see my lease?

486
00:33:06,813 --> 00:33:09,144
- What? No. - That's okay.

487
00:33:10,584 --> 00:33:14,753
However, we have to talk about the Legal Clinic Center.

488
00:33:15,154 --> 00:33:17,424
You know that it's the main thing on our meeting agenda, right?

489
00:33:17,753 --> 00:33:20,463
When you got arrested and ended up in the detention center,

490
00:33:20,523 --> 00:33:21,962
the entire college...

491
00:33:21,963 --> 00:33:23,393
and the law school council were turned upside down.

492
00:33:23,394 --> 00:33:25,594
Even the alumni association.

493
00:33:26,194 --> 00:33:28,163
"How could a criminal be the head of the center?"

494
00:33:28,164 --> 00:33:30,403
"Who'd visit the Legal Clinic Center?"

495
00:33:30,404 --> 00:33:33,703
"No one will come. Not a single soul."

496
00:33:52,354 --> 00:33:53,694
Did you hire these people?

497
00:34:02,703 --> 00:34:04,003
What did you do?

498
00:34:04,503 --> 00:34:07,644
It wasn't me. We did it together.

499
00:34:08,243 --> 00:34:10,012
Shouldn't the Legal Clinic be closed...

500
00:34:10,013 --> 00:34:11,813
now that Professor Oh is in the lockup?

501
00:34:12,244 --> 00:34:15,844
Professor Jung Hee Young also said it should be closed.

502
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:17,083
My goodness.

503
00:34:20,853 --> 00:34:23,154
Something should be done about Professor Oh.

504
00:34:23,393 --> 00:34:25,823
Everyone in the alumni association is voicing their concerns.

505
00:34:25,824 --> 00:34:27,363
They're saying we should fire her at once...

506
00:34:27,364 --> 00:34:28,864
and close down the Legal Clinic.

507
00:34:31,034 --> 00:34:34,603
So I called every police station I frequent...

508
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,073
and told them to send those in need of legal advice...

509
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:38,304
to our legal clinic.

510
00:34:38,933 --> 00:34:41,804
Who knew so many people would come?

511
00:34:42,404 --> 00:34:43,614
I had no idea.

512
00:35:01,893 --> 00:35:04,333
(Chairman Han Sung Bum)

513
00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:09,873
(Assemblyman Lee In Soo)

514
00:35:13,974 --> 00:35:15,372
- Lee In Soo! - Lee In Soo!

515
00:35:15,373 --> 00:35:18,313
- Fairness and common sense. - Lee In Soo!

516
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:21,042
Why is it so hard to reach you?

517
00:35:21,043 --> 00:35:23,053
I've asked you several times to be my spokesperson.

518
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,114
May I recommend someone else, sir?

519
00:35:25,253 --> 00:35:27,654
I'll be right behind this person I'd like to recommend.

520
00:35:28,483 --> 00:35:31,853
You should join hands with the fox in order to keep the tiger in check.

521
00:35:39,864 --> 00:35:42,933
I'll be right behind this person I'm recommending, sir.

522
00:35:43,704 --> 00:35:46,404
Until the sell-off is completed and even after that,

523
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,804
I will take care of Hansu Group.

524
00:35:54,713 --> 00:35:56,784
This guy, again?

525
00:35:57,913 --> 00:36:00,554
Because of this punk, Ju Wan and Hong Seok Pal...

526
00:36:00,753 --> 00:36:03,324
got busted for breaking into Soo Jae's building.

527
00:36:05,353 --> 00:36:06,563
But...

528
00:36:07,963 --> 00:36:10,333
Soo Jae is staying at his place now?

529
00:36:34,983 --> 00:36:37,353
(Partner Lawyer Oh Soo Jae)

530
00:36:44,764 --> 00:36:47,233
You look great for someone who survived such a rough patch.

531
00:36:47,503 --> 00:36:48,933
In fact, you look even better.

532
00:36:49,704 --> 00:36:53,003
My, this is much nicer than my office.

533
00:36:53,904 --> 00:36:56,174
- Your office? - I guess you haven't heard.

534
00:36:56,844 --> 00:36:58,643
I'm joining the firm next week.

535
00:37:00,413 --> 00:37:02,812
Jun Myeong! I heard you'd be here today.

536
00:37:02,813 --> 00:37:04,053
Hey, Young Bae.

537
00:37:04,054 --> 00:37:06,283
My goodness, you're getting old too.

538
00:37:06,284 --> 00:37:07,653
You're starting to look your age now.

539
00:37:07,654 --> 00:37:10,253
Right? People say I look younger than my age, but I can't defy age.

540
00:37:11,094 --> 00:37:12,994
Hey, plan a team dinner for me next week.

541
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,533
Come on. I'm sure you're close to the partners.

542
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:20,233
Sure thing! I'll arrange a full-course dinner.

543
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:22,603
- Take it easy. - See you.

544
00:37:22,733 --> 00:37:24,773
Hey, when we go out for the team dinner...

545
00:37:26,873 --> 00:37:27,974
Let's grab a drink together.

546
00:37:31,474 --> 00:37:32,543
Have a good day!

547
00:37:35,844 --> 00:37:38,183
Darn it. I'm so annoyed.

548
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:40,122
I can't stand him.

549
00:37:40,123 --> 00:37:42,853
That scumbag made a move on Hee Young in the past.

550
00:37:42,983 --> 00:37:45,954
Why did Chairman Choi accept that jerk?

551
00:37:46,224 --> 00:37:48,724
Does he have something on Chairman Choi?

552
00:37:54,103 --> 00:37:55,863
I said, let go!

553
00:37:55,864 --> 00:37:57,403
What are you doing?

554
00:37:57,404 --> 00:37:59,203
I told you. Let go.

555
00:37:59,204 --> 00:38:01,243
Seriously, what are you doing?

556
00:38:01,244 --> 00:38:02,543
You can't do this...

557
00:38:04,143 --> 00:38:06,114
My apologies, sir. I'm really sorry.

558
00:38:06,543 --> 00:38:08,713
- Get up. - Let go.

559
00:38:09,183 --> 00:38:10,753
- I said, let go! - Just leave him be.

560
00:38:15,554 --> 00:38:17,094
Are you going to stay on the floor like that?

561
00:38:22,324 --> 00:38:23,893
Please help me, sir.

562
00:38:24,364 --> 00:38:27,003
I got fired from the school, and my wife divorced me.

563
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:29,103
I can't live like this.

564
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:32,304
You're the only one who can save me, sir.

565
00:38:34,344 --> 00:38:36,813
- Me? - I can even risk my life for you.

566
00:38:37,174 --> 00:38:38,772
I'll do anything you say, sir!

567
00:38:38,773 --> 00:38:41,884
You'd risk your life for me? I don't believe in that stuff.

568
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:43,213
Those who say that are full of it.

569
00:38:51,154 --> 00:38:54,424
I guess there's some kind of misunderstanding.

570
00:38:54,864 --> 00:38:56,694
Why are you being like this, sir?

571
00:38:57,063 --> 00:39:00,503
Shouldn't you be nice to me, for old time's sake?

572
00:39:01,003 --> 00:39:02,404
Have you forgotten all about it?

573
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:05,973
Ten years ago, I did exactly what you told me to do.

574
00:39:05,974 --> 00:39:08,703
Back then, you were Chief Prosecutor Choi Tae Guk.

575
00:39:08,704 --> 00:39:11,673
Don't you remember how thorough I was?

576
00:39:11,674 --> 00:39:13,813
Must you make me bring this up?

577
00:39:15,713 --> 00:39:17,554
Chief Prosecutor Choi Tae Guk.

578
00:39:19,054 --> 00:39:20,723
You haven't changed one bit, Jun Myeong.

579
00:39:20,724 --> 00:39:23,353
I prefer this as it's much simpler this way.

580
00:39:27,494 --> 00:39:28,563
Have you eaten yet?

581
00:39:37,674 --> 00:39:39,832
Hey, talk to Chairman Choi.

582
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:42,404
Tell him not to accept that despicable scumbag.

583
00:39:43,574 --> 00:39:46,174
He'll listen to you.

584
00:39:47,944 --> 00:39:51,954
You know, the chief legal officer position at Hansu.

585
00:39:52,913 --> 00:39:53,924
Yes.

586
00:39:54,023 --> 00:39:56,694
Chairman Han is asking me to recommend someone.

587
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:59,994
But you said you'd stay at TK forever.

588
00:40:01,293 --> 00:40:02,424
What? Me?

589
00:40:02,924 --> 00:40:05,563
Who stays at the same company forever these days?

590
00:40:05,764 --> 00:40:07,603
I can work elsewhere.

591
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,634
- Really? - Come on, Soo Jae.

592
00:40:11,704 --> 00:40:14,244
Seriously consider recommending me for the position.

593
00:40:15,804 --> 00:40:16,913
Okay.

594
00:40:18,213 --> 00:40:22,143
Oh, right. I forgot to ask Hee Young something earlier.

595
00:40:22,543 --> 00:40:25,982
Assemblyman Lee needs a spokesperson for his campaign team.

596
00:40:25,983 --> 00:40:29,054
I thought Hee Young would be a good fit. What do you think?

597
00:40:29,154 --> 00:40:30,253
Hey.

598
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,253
My gosh, thanks a lot.

599
00:40:33,523 --> 00:40:36,522
How come we had no idea you cared so much about us?

600
00:40:36,523 --> 00:40:38,163
Why didn't I know this?

601
00:40:38,264 --> 00:40:39,962
Gosh, I'm getting goosebumps.

602
00:40:39,963 --> 00:40:41,103
(Chairman Choi Tae Guk)

603
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:44,872
It's strictly confidential until it's finalized.

604
00:40:44,873 --> 00:40:47,574
Of course. Strictly confidential. Don't you worry.

605
00:40:47,704 --> 00:40:48,704
Thank you.

606
00:40:48,705 --> 00:40:50,974
I'm getting goosebumps all over. Hey, thanks!

607
00:40:55,543 --> 00:40:56,583
Are you serious?

608
00:40:56,784 --> 00:40:59,812
Yes! I think Soo Jae will recommend us.

609
00:40:59,813 --> 00:41:02,223
It's so amazing. We've practically hit the jackpot!

610
00:41:02,224 --> 00:41:03,523
Oh, no.

611
00:41:04,154 --> 00:41:08,094
I had no idea. I was trying to get her kicked out of the Legal Clinic.

612
00:41:08,594 --> 00:41:11,594
What? Are you crazy? Apologize to Soo Jae at once.

613
00:41:11,893 --> 00:41:13,962
Apologize and beg for her forgiveness.

614
00:41:13,963 --> 00:41:17,203
Text her right now and ask her to help us out.

615
00:41:17,204 --> 00:41:20,574
Yesterday's enemy is today's friend! Okay?

616
00:41:22,974 --> 00:41:26,173
You all had to stay late to prepare my lunch.

617
00:41:26,174 --> 00:41:27,313
Gosh, I'm sorry.

618
00:41:27,784 --> 00:41:29,043
No problem, sir.

619
00:41:30,483 --> 00:41:34,384
We prepared grilled red tilefish, your favorite.

620
00:41:36,483 --> 00:41:38,554
Nothing tastes better than a home-cooked meal.

621
00:41:39,023 --> 00:41:40,864
And here, take this.

622
00:41:41,163 --> 00:41:42,863
Buy snacks for your staff.

623
00:41:42,864 --> 00:41:44,163
- Thank you. - No problem, sir.

624
00:41:46,233 --> 00:41:47,333
All right.

625
00:41:52,974 --> 00:41:56,844
Grilled red tilefish is the best. Try it.

626
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,313
I'm sure you didn't call me here to have red tilefish with me.

627
00:41:59,813 --> 00:42:03,014
Chairman Han wants to hire Min Young Bae.

628
00:42:03,483 --> 00:42:04,852
I was offered the position.

629
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:06,784
I asked him if he knew anyone I could recommend,

630
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:08,853
and he expressed keen interest in the position.

631
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:12,154
And his wife will join Assemblyman Lee's campaign team?

632
00:42:12,393 --> 00:42:15,224
The same goes for that position. It was offered to me.

633
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,523
Do you know...

634
00:42:17,233 --> 00:42:20,233
what I think about when I'm with those two men?

635
00:42:21,404 --> 00:42:23,603
That greasy, ignorant face.

636
00:42:24,034 --> 00:42:26,074
And that boorish man's arrogant face.

637
00:42:26,674 --> 00:42:30,174
I wonder how I can use them and crush them.

638
00:42:31,474 --> 00:42:32,843
Why are you being so blunt?

639
00:42:32,844 --> 00:42:34,244
I'm being honest.

640
00:42:35,143 --> 00:42:36,713
Let's be honest for once, shall we?

641
00:42:38,384 --> 00:42:41,884
Do you have a copy of Hansu Group's flash drive?

642
00:42:42,954 --> 00:42:43,954
Yes.

643
00:42:43,955 --> 00:42:46,353
And everything from Mr. Ha's desk too?

644
00:42:47,123 --> 00:42:50,493
Yes, including a video that shows everything the three of you did...

645
00:42:50,494 --> 00:42:51,893
while having fun.

646
00:42:51,994 --> 00:42:53,864
I have what you have.

647
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:56,003
And you have what I have.

648
00:42:57,233 --> 00:43:01,174
That's why they are seeking your advice.

649
00:43:01,404 --> 00:43:04,413
We just leveled the playing field. That's all.

650
00:43:05,844 --> 00:43:07,212
Level the playing field?

651
00:43:07,213 --> 00:43:10,353
You got what you wanted and got rid of your problems.

652
00:43:11,353 --> 00:43:12,582
I see. I'm still here.

653
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:15,083
You're an asset to me. That's why you're still here.

654
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,654
And you're an asset to me too.

655
00:43:17,924 --> 00:43:19,454
That's why I'm back.

656
00:43:21,163 --> 00:43:22,864
I like this honesty between us.

657
00:43:25,264 --> 00:43:27,804
Son, come and join us for lunch.

658
00:43:30,034 --> 00:43:32,873
I just came to say hello. I have somewhere to be.

659
00:43:34,773 --> 00:43:37,873
Yoon Sang wants to learn from you as your intern.

660
00:43:38,043 --> 00:43:39,343
Teach him a lot.

661
00:43:39,344 --> 00:43:41,944
I'll come to work starting next week, Ms. Oh.

662
00:43:42,884 --> 00:43:45,114
- Why? - Pardon?

663
00:43:45,253 --> 00:43:47,682
You left the Legal Clinic Center as you pleased.

664
00:43:47,683 --> 00:43:49,154
Now, you want to be my intern?

665
00:43:49,724 --> 00:43:51,094
I don't understand this.

666
00:43:51,853 --> 00:43:54,764
You can't expect to understand everything in life.

667
00:43:56,523 --> 00:43:58,663
Please buy me a cup of coffee, Ms. Oh.

668
00:44:09,043 --> 00:44:12,913
So she wants to shake up the playing field I built.

669
00:44:23,554 --> 00:44:26,123
What are you thinking? Why do you want to be my intern?

670
00:44:26,353 --> 00:44:28,324
Then why are you staying at Chan's place?

671
00:44:29,994 --> 00:44:33,063
You can go to a hotel. Why are you staying at his place?

672
00:44:33,764 --> 00:44:35,663
Only men live there. Isn't it uncomfortable?

673
00:44:37,433 --> 00:44:38,634
It's nice.

674
00:44:39,804 --> 00:44:41,674
I just like it there.

675
00:44:42,804 --> 00:44:45,474
I like the rooftop, and the food is great too.

676
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:49,183
It's fun.

677
00:44:51,514 --> 00:44:53,554
My insomnia went away too.

678
00:44:55,454 --> 00:44:57,724
I didn't know, but I could sleep for 23 hours a day.

679
00:44:58,253 --> 00:44:59,694
You must really like it there.

680
00:44:59,824 --> 00:45:00,864
I do.

681
00:45:04,634 --> 00:45:05,864
But Soo Jae.

682
00:45:06,793 --> 00:45:08,364
Move out of there fast if you can.

683
00:45:09,603 --> 00:45:11,603
Chan is on my father's radar now.

684
00:45:11,974 --> 00:45:13,642
If you stay at his place...

685
00:45:13,643 --> 00:45:15,103
Nothing good will come of it.

686
00:45:17,913 --> 00:45:20,444
Right. Thank you for your concern.

687
00:45:23,183 --> 00:45:24,183
Okay.

688
00:45:25,713 --> 00:45:28,424
I feel like you're thanking me to draw the line between us.

689
00:45:30,224 --> 00:45:33,764
I'm disappointed. And it doesn't feel good, Soo Jae.

690
00:45:35,694 --> 00:45:36,793
Anyway,

691
00:45:37,463 --> 00:45:40,163
I look forward to learning from you as your intern.

692
00:45:41,433 --> 00:45:43,163
And I'm sorry,

693
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:45,603
but I'll need a few more days until I can work.

694
00:46:14,534 --> 00:46:16,103
Hello, Ms. Oh Soo Jung.

695
00:46:16,963 --> 00:46:19,002
Ms. Oh Soo Jae sent me here.

696
00:46:19,003 --> 00:46:20,444
My name is Song Mi Rim.

697
00:46:23,143 --> 00:46:24,574
Oh Annoying...

698
00:46:25,344 --> 00:46:28,384
is really going to help me?

699
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:30,384
Gosh.

(Better Tomorrow, Corrections for Hopes)

701
00:46:31,884 --> 00:46:35,123
Yes. I just finished interviewing Ms. Oh Soo Jung.

702
00:46:35,753 --> 00:46:38,853
The prosecutor demanded two years in prison at her trial.

703
00:46:39,194 --> 00:46:41,864
I think her criminal record worked against her.

704
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:43,593
But still.

705
00:46:43,594 --> 00:46:45,833
She just stole a pair of sneakers. How can she get two years?

706
00:46:45,963 --> 00:46:46,963
What about those chairmen...

707
00:46:46,963 --> 00:46:47,963
who embezzled hundreds of millions of dollars?

708
00:46:47,964 --> 00:46:49,833
Shouldn't they get a life sentence?

709
00:46:51,034 --> 00:46:52,872
Remove the public defender from her counsel.

710
00:46:52,873 --> 00:46:54,744
Put down our names as her counsel.

711
00:46:54,974 --> 00:46:57,343
Okay. As a matter of fact, Ms. Oh Soo Jung...

712
00:46:57,344 --> 00:46:59,042
didn't know you would really help her.

713
00:46:59,043 --> 00:47:00,744
She was so touched.

714
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:03,812
And I got her son's phone number, so I talked to him.

715
00:47:03,813 --> 00:47:06,554
And her son is really kind too.

716
00:47:06,784 --> 00:47:08,682
He's a construction worker right now.

717
00:47:08,683 --> 00:47:11,424
But he said he would make a lot of money and pay our fees.

718
00:47:12,324 --> 00:47:16,123
By the way, I'll keep your nickname a secret.

00:47:21,103 --> 00:47:22,663
I'm getting a call. I'll talk to you later.

721
00:47:22,963 --> 00:47:24,873
Okay, Ms. Oh Annoying.

722
00:47:29,244 --> 00:47:30,744
("Lectures on Code of Civil Procedure")

723
00:47:31,244 --> 00:47:35,312
We've had more than 100 visitors over the past 2 weeks.

724
00:47:35,313 --> 00:47:37,213
Do you think we can really solve all of these cases?

725
00:47:37,384 --> 00:47:38,683
We should try.

726
00:47:40,154 --> 00:47:42,983
This just proves that Ms. Song is very good at her job.

727
00:47:44,154 --> 00:47:46,694
A professional woman is so cool.

728
00:47:47,494 --> 00:47:48,623
She's charismatic too.

729
00:47:49,224 --> 00:47:50,463
Ask her out already.

730
00:47:51,764 --> 00:47:54,303
You already knew that I liked her?

731
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:55,703
You're basically telling us...

732
00:47:55,704 --> 00:47:58,704
that you like Ms. Song. And Chan likes Professor Oh.

733
00:47:59,904 --> 00:48:01,573
This shouldn't be called the Legal Clinic Center,

734
00:48:01,574 --> 00:48:03,273
but the Romance Clinic.

735
00:48:05,474 --> 00:48:08,212
I knew it. You were born to be a detective.

736
00:48:08,213 --> 00:48:09,813
You were born with this talent.

737
00:48:11,353 --> 00:48:12,353
You two.

738
00:48:13,554 --> 00:48:15,654
Gosh, there's so much work. Seriously.

739
00:48:18,554 --> 00:48:21,324
- Hey, Hyung Chil. - Chan, you must get here now!

740
00:48:21,463 --> 00:48:23,993
A man came to see Professor Oh...

741
00:48:23,994 --> 00:48:25,393
in a super expensive car.

742
00:48:25,733 --> 00:48:28,063
He gave us his business card. He's some CEO.

"CEO Yoon Se Pil of SP Partners".

The food here is pretty good.

00:49:01,764 --> 00:49:03,304
I should be a regular here.

748
00:49:03,433 --> 00:49:05,474
No. Should I buy this place?

749
00:49:07,804 --> 00:49:09,844
You seem especially cheerful today.

750
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:14,114
I think I'll be able to achieve my goal just as I planned.

751
00:49:16,683 --> 00:49:17,683
Your goal...

752
00:49:17,813 --> 00:49:20,954
Do you know what my goal is? Taking down the three of them.

753
00:49:21,384 --> 00:49:23,893
I want to see them fall hard at the same time.

754
00:49:25,194 --> 00:49:27,563
I didn't ask you that day, but I want to ask you today.

755
00:49:28,523 --> 00:49:29,563
Why?

756
00:49:30,063 --> 00:49:32,293
Why has that become your goal?

757
00:49:32,694 --> 00:49:34,062
Ms. Oh, how would you feel...

758
00:49:34,063 --> 00:49:36,364
if you can't take the 70 million dollars?

759
00:49:36,433 --> 00:49:38,204
Answer my question first.

760
00:49:39,534 --> 00:49:41,944
Why do you want them to be ruined?

761
00:49:43,574 --> 00:49:46,974
It's not the appropriate time to tell you why.

762
00:49:47,944 --> 00:49:49,913
But I'll tell you when that has become my goal.

763
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:52,183
Ten years ago.

Sure. Let's do that.

00:50:05,494 --> 00:50:07,364
Okay. I'll call you.

Okay. Bye.

770
00:50:13,704 --> 00:50:17,944
Oh, did I not tell you that I'm quite close to Director Baek?

771
00:50:18,643 --> 00:50:19,744
Not at all.

772
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:24,884
Director Baek almost became my father-in-law.

773
00:50:26,753 --> 00:50:31,224
From what I know, he never had a daughter.

774

No. He has a daughter.

Number one, you would be angry.

Number two, you would be livid.

785
00:51:03,284 --> 00:51:06,454
Number three, you would be livid...

786
00:51:06,824 --> 00:51:09,062
and destroy me for ruining the three of them...

787
00:51:09,063 --> 00:51:10,163
and making it impossible for them...

788
00:51:10,393 --> 00:51:12,034
to give you the money.

789
00:51:12,094 --> 00:51:14,933

00:54:08,574 --> 00:54:11,444
You drank earlier. You really shouldn't drive today.

818
00:54:13,974 --> 00:54:16,182
The drunk driver who caused the accident...

819
00:54:16,183 --> 00:54:18,252
kept refusing to take the breathalyzer test.

820
00:54:18,253 --> 00:54:20,053
So we had to arrest her at the scene,

821
00:54:20,054 --> 00:54:21,683
and she's at the station now.

822
00:54:22,054 --> 00:54:24,022
She said you were some successful lawyer.

823
00:54:24,023 --> 00:54:27,094
She made a scene, demanding to call you to the station.

824
00:54:27,824 --> 00:54:29,963
But why didn't you answer your mother's calls?

825
00:54:30,994 --> 00:54:33,832
You're lucky that the victim was understanding.

826
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:35,863
If not, you would be in the holding cell right now.

827
00:54:35,864 --> 00:54:38,373
That driver wasn't even hurt!

828
00:54:38,534 --> 00:54:41,542
Only the rear bumper was dented. Why would I get locked up?

829
00:54:41,543 --> 00:54:43,142
Gosh. Please lower your voice!

830
00:54:43,143 --> 00:54:44,174
Mom.

831
00:54:45,844 --> 00:54:48,812
Hey, I didn't drink a lot.

832
00:54:48,813 --> 00:54:51,413
I only had a glass of beer when I was eating with my friends.

833
00:54:52,083 --> 00:54:54,252
I sobered up before I drove. Gosh, it wasn't drunk driving.

834
00:54:54,253 --> 00:54:56,923
Drinking before driving is called drunk driving, ma'am.

835
00:54:56,924 --> 00:55:00,292
I apologize. I'll make sure to compensate the victim.

836
00:55:00,293 --> 00:55:01,892
But she still has to comply with the test,

837
00:55:01,893 --> 00:55:03,662
so we can conclude the report.

838
00:55:03,663 --> 00:55:05,163
Right. She will.

839
00:55:06,833 --> 00:55:08,634
Fine. I'll do it.

840
00:55:09,063 --> 00:55:11,034
Blow into the breathalyzer.

841
00:55:12,534 --> 00:55:13,904
Blow it hard, Mom.

842
00:55:16,273 --> 00:55:20,543
(Ganghwa Police Station)

843
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,954
My gosh, Mr. Gong.

844
00:55:30,424 --> 00:55:31,753
You came with her?

845
00:55:32,253 --> 00:55:33,253
Yes.

846
00:55:33,254 --> 00:55:37,364
I wasn't even drunk when I drove. He kept saying that I did.

847
00:55:38,393 --> 00:55:39,933
What kind of law is this?

848
00:55:40,333 --> 00:55:42,333
Our law has many flaws.

849
00:55:42,404 --> 00:55:44,474
Right. Please get in.

850
00:55:46,704 --> 00:55:49,174
Anyway, I'm sorry.

851
00:55:49,373 --> 00:55:52,873
But I really wasn't drunk.

852
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:56,244
Okay. Get home safely.

853
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:04,453
By the way, what about my car? I need to fix the front bumper.

854
00:56:04,454 --> 00:56:06,954
I'm going to sell it because your license got revoked.

855
00:56:07,023 --> 00:56:08,264
Don't do that!

856
00:56:30,543 --> 00:56:33,454
I'm getting hungry. Do you want to get something to eat?

857
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:40,094
We can watch the sunrise someplace high.

858
00:56:42,793 --> 00:56:44,264
Let's just go back.

859
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:46,893
Okay.

860
00:57:26,304 --> 00:57:28,574
Where are we?

861
00:57:29,503 --> 00:57:30,772
I was hungry.

862
00:57:30,773 --> 00:57:32,444
I needed something to eat before we went back.

863
00:57:50,224 --> 00:57:51,293
All right.

864
00:58:00,503 --> 00:58:01,574
Ta-da.

865
00:58:04,074 --> 00:58:06,744
There's one more thing I want to show you. Go to the front.

866
00:58:22,963 --> 00:58:24,293
What is this?

867
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:29,034
Don't people have one of these on their car?

868
00:58:35,244 --> 00:58:37,043
How fascinating and nice.

869
00:58:37,174 --> 00:58:40,143
Right? Having cup noodles here will be so good.

870
00:58:41,483 --> 00:58:44,183
How fascinating and nice you are.

871
00:58:50,054 --> 00:58:52,623
I thought you knew. Why...

872
00:58:53,623 --> 00:58:55,264
are you acting like you didn't?

873
00:59:12,913 --> 00:59:15,244
How can anyone be so adorable like you?

874
00:59:15,543 --> 00:59:17,344
What? Did you just drop...

875
00:59:20,954 --> 00:59:22,083
Have you gone mad?

876
00:59:22,324 --> 00:59:25,054
Is that something you should say to someone you want to kiss now?

877
00:59:25,393 --> 00:59:26,723
Then should you say that to someone...

878
00:59:26,724 --> 00:59:27,724
who just told you about her feelings?

879
00:59:59,023 --> 01:00:00,523
Do you have a wish?

880
01:00:00,994 --> 01:00:02,063
A wish?

881
01:00:04,864 --> 01:00:07,393
I never thought about making a wish.

882
01:00:07,933 --> 01:00:09,563
Other than when I was a little girl.

883
01:00:09,634 --> 01:00:11,102
You should still make a wish.

884
01:00:11,103 --> 01:00:12,633
You haven't made a wish in a long time.

885
01:00:12,634 --> 01:00:13,773
I'm sure it'll come true.

886
01:00:15,304 --> 01:00:16,444
Shall I then?

887
01:00:28,554 --> 01:00:29,583
Well,

888
01:00:33,293 --> 01:00:34,724
you...

889
01:00:35,764 --> 01:00:37,764
will get to know me more.

890
01:00:43,003 --> 01:00:45,074
I wasn't able to say this to anyone.

891
01:00:46,704 --> 01:00:49,043
But what I wanted to share with you...

892
01:00:51,174 --> 01:00:52,873
I will tell you about it someday.

893
01:00:55,583 --> 01:00:56,884
I didn't want...

894
01:00:58,454 --> 01:01:00,683
anyone to find out...

895
01:01:04,384 --> 01:01:06,724
how desperate I had been to survive.

896
01:01:08,864 --> 01:01:10,393
But you will end up seeing that.

897
01:01:14,634 --> 01:01:18,233
Even if you don't understand that or find it unattractive...

898
01:01:24,043 --> 01:01:25,474
Even if so,

899
01:01:27,114 --> 01:01:28,514
I hope your feelings for me...

900
01:01:30,844 --> 01:01:32,983
won't be hurt as much.

901
01:01:38,224 --> 01:01:39,224
What about you?

902
01:01:42,623 --> 01:01:44,494
There is something I haven't told you yet either.

903
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:48,003
I don't want you to find out,

904
01:01:49,563 --> 01:01:51,063
but I have to tell you.

905
01:01:54,603 --> 01:01:56,543
I know that I have to tell you,

906
01:01:57,404 --> 01:01:59,174
but I still hesitate to tell you.

907
01:02:02,284 --> 01:02:03,784
I will tell you everything.

908
01:02:05,384 --> 01:02:07,014
And you will hate me for sure.

909
01:02:08,784 --> 01:02:10,253
Even if you do, stay by my side.

910
01:02:12,224 --> 01:02:13,893
You can hate me.

911
01:02:15,063 --> 01:02:16,393
So don't go anywhere else.

912
01:02:17,264 --> 01:02:18,864
The same goes for you too.

913
01:02:19,893 --> 01:02:20,963
Don't go anywhere else.

914
01:03:13,483 --> 01:03:16,424
(Why Her?)

915
01:03:36,643 --> 01:03:39,944
Father, when someone comes after someone I care about, I go crazy.

916
01:03:40,273 --> 01:03:41,884
You take after me more.

917
01:03:41,913 --> 01:03:44,042
I will never give up my seat.

918
01:03:44,043 --> 01:03:46,013
You're not at Hansu Group. You're at TK Law Firm.

919
01:03:46,014 --> 01:03:47,182
Without my father's help,

920
01:03:47,183 --> 01:03:48,724
the law firm wouldn't have made it this far.

921
01:03:48,924 --> 01:03:51,553
What can you do? You have less power than me.

922
01:03:51,554 --> 01:03:53,993
No, Yoon Sang. I'll risk everything I have to protect her.

923
01:03:53,994 --> 01:03:55,693
He's not Kim Dong Gu.

924
01:03:55,694 --> 01:03:59,232
- Ma'am, he's not Kim Dong Gu. - Kim Dong Gu!

925
01:03:59,233 --> 01:04:01,034
I need to talk to you. I just need five minutes.

926
01:04:01,364 --> 01:04:02,403
I'm sorry.

927
01:04:02,404 --> 01:04:04,263
There's been a collapse in Yeongpyeong District.

928
01:04:04,264 --> 01:04:05,932
Why did you let them die?

929
01:04:05,933 --> 01:04:08,002
They just recused another survivor. But he's unconscious.

930
01:04:08,003 --> 01:04:09,143
What do we do, Ms. Oh?
