Yes, yes.

13
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:02,630
- Chairman Choi, take the last shot.
- Okay.

14
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,739
- My gosh, thank you.
- You should drink too.

15
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,870
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

16
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:10,209
- Cheers.
- I love you, sir.

17
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,379
Don't worry and just focus on your jobs.

18
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,510
- Yes, sir.
- We believe in you.

19
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:17,049
Sir, get in the back. I'll drive.

20
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,180
No, sir. I'll drive you tonight.

21
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,349
Look. I didn't drink that much. It's okay.

22
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,019
- Get in.
- Yes, sir.

23
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,219
- Hey, get the door for him.
- Of course.

24
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,659
Goodness.

25
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,670
I can't believe I'm getting a ride
in your car, Chairman Choi.

26
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,400
I'm so lucky.

27
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:41,840
I could drive for you, you know.

28
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,010
(Ms. Na Se Na)

29
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:49,609
Ms. Na, what's going on?

30
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,019
I was just wondering
if you got home safely.

31
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,620
I'm on my way home right now.

32
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,989
I'm so sorry for leaving first.

33
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,930
My mother suddenly didn't feel well,
so I had to go.

34
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,000
Of course, you should go
if your mother is unwell.

35
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,599
I'm not that strict, you know.

36
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,960
What was that? Did he just hit a man?

37
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,659
I... I should call an ambulance.

38
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:41,199
What... What's the number?

39
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,800
- Put that down!
- Sorry?

40
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,810
He's dead anyway.

41
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:53,310
Do you want to end your life here?

42
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:56,509
That's right.

43
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:00,180
If you two keep your mouths shut,

44
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:03,789
I'll prevent your companies
from going bankrupt,

45
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,689
and I'll take care of you...

46
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,229
for the rest of your lives. Got it?

47
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:09,789
Got it?

48
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,460
Yes, sir.

49
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,139
(Ms. Na Se Na)

50
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,669
Ms. Na. You heard me, right?

51
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:23,639
If you stay on my side,

52
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,009
I'll make you...

53
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,710
a full-time teacher.

54
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,319
I can even make you
the principal of my school. Got it?

55
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:48,870
(My daughter)

56
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,939
(Dark Hole)

57
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:56,240
My dad told me...

58
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,639
that people are the scariest.

59
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,509
I'm scared of the infected,

60
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,719
but I'm more scared
of people like Jin Seok.

61
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,620
He only tries to save himself
in a situation like this.

62
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:11,689
The bad guys will pay for what they did...

63
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:15,129
no matter how much the world changes.

64
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,399
Do you really think so?

65
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,939
My dad died in a hit-and-run accident.

66
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,509
But no one got punished for that.

67
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:30,069
It seems like...

68
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,810
only the victims pay the price.

69
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:40,079
(Order, justice, love)

70
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:43,819
"Order, justice, love".

71
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:46,720
It's all a lie.

72
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,129
Right?

73
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,490
What? What is it?

74
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,259
What are you going to check?

75
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,790
Let's just keep going.

76
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,990
He just never listens.

77
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,610
What about your mother?

78
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:41,350
My mom died
when I was in elementary school.

79
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,920
I have no family.

80
00:05:55,329 --> 00:05:58,029
I saw the serial killer
who killed my husband.

81
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:00,699
She put a white cloth over his head...

82
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:03,199
and injected him in the neck.

83
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,079
I still can't believe that
Soo Yeon did such a terrible thing.

84
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,709
Detective, are you okay?

85
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:53,350
(Muji Hospital)

86
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,019
Where did he run away to?
Why can't I find him?

87
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,290
I knew this would happen.

88
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,829
I posted a wish...

89
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:06,959
that we shouldn't accept
any more worthless immigrants.

90
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:08,699
- It's called a "petition".
- Isn't it a wish?

91
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:10,029
How ignorant of you.

92
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,370
By the way, why did the shaman
ask us to catch him?

93
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,339
That jerk is a lowlife.

94
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,509
He has dirty blood on his hands.

95
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:19,009
Dirty blood?

96
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,879
Does that mean he killed people?

97
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:23,779
I don't know that much either.

98
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:27,250
But the shaman called him a filthy lowlife
who did something really bad.

99
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,220
We need to catch him and offer him
as a sacrifice for us to live.

100
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:32,589
- Shine the light in every corner.
- Okay, let's find him.

101
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,389
- Oh, gosh.
- Come on.

102
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:39,699
- It's too dark, so...
- Let's hurry up.

103
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:54,750
I want to go home, Mom.

104
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,980
Where did all the cows go?
What did you do?

105
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,449
You jerk!

106
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,050
I want to go home.

107
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,220
Who did this?

108
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,730
My goodness.

109
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:20,470
Darn it.

110
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:25,410
I want to go home!

111
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,129
I... I don't want to die.

112
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,159
I don't want to die.

113
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:56,269
I don't want to die.

114
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,080
You're such a little woman
but you're controlling all these people.

115
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,139
I guess you're a woman of great charisma.

116
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,679
Why?

117
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,019
Do you want to live too?

118
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,090
What? Are you saying that you can save me?

119
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,730
Not me. The higher being.

120
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,629
That kind of crazy talk won't work on me.

121
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,000
Should I...

122
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:36,440
stab you with this or not?

123
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:39,110
You tell me.

124
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:50,220
Do you think you can kill me?

125
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:53,889
What are you doing?

126
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,059
You can never kill me.

127
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:01,700
The one who will shed blood
is you, not me.

128
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,919
(Restricted Area)

129
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,559
I know you're in here.

130
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,100
It's okay. You're safe with me.

131
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,269
I'm a security staff of this hospital.

132
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,269
I'm trying to protect you.

133
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,039
The man who came here with you...

134
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,539
asked me to bring you along.

135
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,279
Are you telling the truth?

136
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,149
You're a good guy?

137
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,450
Yes.

138
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,120
I am a good guy.

139
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,120
So you can relax.

140
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,899
Gosh, this little brat. You were in here.

141
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,230
I'm sorry.

142
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,870
I'm really sorry.

143
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,070
Bring him to me.

144
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:20,139
If you want to live,

145
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,110
just do as the higher being tells you.

146
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,009
I saw everything.

147
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:00,350
That filthy blood on your hand.

148
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:09,889
No, it's not like that.
Boss tried to kill me first.

149
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,759
Don't be afraid.

150
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,700
I'm just trying to bring you joy.

151
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,360
(Master Key)

152
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:54,269
Nice.

153
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,179
It seems there isn't anything useful.

154
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:25,860
I guess the old saying was right.

155
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,600
Turn a crisis into an opportunity.

156
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,870
Wait.

157
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:39,909
I need to go to the toilet.

158
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,710
I'm sorry for making you wait.

159
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,720
What was that?

160
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:41,169
Is he infected?

161
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:44,779
Snake Eyes?

162
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:50,309
Snake Eyes... Why are you...

163
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,289
Why is Snake Eyes here?

164
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,690
What was that?

165
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,190
Well, he's...

166
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:11,339
There you go. This is for you.

167
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,839
Ma'am. Thank you so much.

168
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:16,269
But won't we be in trouble for this?

169
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,779
We'll be okay as long as
Chairman Choi doesn't find out.

170
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,079
What's he going to do about it, kill us?

171
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,680
But if you eat too much
and get an upset stomach,

172
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,880
I can't do anything about that. Got it?

173
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,589
Enjoy it while it's hot.

174
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,720
It won't taste good when it gets cold.

175
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,059
Hey, this is lit.

176
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,259
What did you say? Lit?

177
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,599
Is it a swear word?

178
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,670
Grandma, when you say "it's lit",
it means "it's great".

179
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:45,839
Oh, is that so?

180
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,480
Oh, right. Chang Hee and Do Yoon
should have some too.

181
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,180
Here you go.

182
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:00,579
How is it? It's lit, isn't it?

183
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,890
Yes, it's lit.

184
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,549
Why?

185
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:13,559
No, I thought I heard something.

186
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,630
Is that miserable jerk coming back again?

187
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:16,789
Do you mean Chairman Choi?

188
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:19,630
Yes, that Chairman or whatever.

189
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,930
That scum who makes
a drama out of everything.

190
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:24,269
Ma'am, you're so good at cursing.

191
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,740
You guys better hurry up and eat
before you get an earful from me as well.

192
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:32,240
Ma'am, you should open a buchimgae shop.

193
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:33,740
I'll invest in it.

194
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:35,609
Me too.

195
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,049
You're too young to have enough money.

196
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:41,319
Then I can work as a part-timer!

197
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,049
I'm really good at serving.

198
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:50,460
Do Yoon, do you not like it?

199
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,400
- It's not that.
- Then why aren't you eating more?

200
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,500
I'm leaving some for Hwa Seon.

201
00:19:56,769 --> 00:19:58,299
Don't worry.

202
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:01,000
I already set aside some...

203
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:03,339
for those who went to get the medicine.

204

Hey, why are you suddenly crying?

205
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,450
My mom liked buchimgae too.
Kimchi buchimgae.

206
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,059
Darn it, this is so embarrassing.

207

You too?

208

Don't worry.

209

I'm sure they're all safe and sound.

210
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,829
Brace yourselves and eat well.

211
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:32,000
Then you'll be able to meet your parents.
Isn't that right?

212
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:36,910
I see that you're all having fun.

213
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,710
Why are you alone? Where are the others?

214
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,509
Why? Do you want to die with them?

215
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:46,420
Hey!

216
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,089
Watch your mouth!

217
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,930
You are the ones who should watch out.

218

- You're still alive!

He's going to die anyway,
so what's the point?

221
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:14,680
That jerk must've stolen the medicine bag!

222
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:20,119
You're worse than an animal.
I'm going to kill you myself!

223

Shut it! I'm not. I'm not infected!

228

Don't come any closer.

I said don't come closer!

230

He's totally lost his mind.

That little snake.

503

Did you just call me a snake?

504
00:45:50,019 --> 00:45:52,619
What? I didn't call you by anything.

505
00:45:52,789 --> 00:45:55,960
Whatever. I need to talk to you.

506
00:45:55,989 --> 00:45:56,989
Okay.

507
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:00,000
He has chinky eyes like a snake.

508

What did you just say?

509
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,670
Nothing. I'm coming.

510
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:13,940
- Where are we going?
- Just follow me.

511
00:46:29,989 --> 00:46:31,059
Hey.

512
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,730
Don't go up there. It's dangerous.

516
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:50,150
Officer,

517
00:46:50,179 --> 00:46:52,679
I ran the numbers.

518
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:55,480
It's about your debt.

519
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,449
Do you want to know
how to pay it off at once?

520
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:01,719
What... what is it?

521
00:47:04,929 --> 00:47:06,659
That should suffice.

522
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:10,500
Why do you want the gun for?

523
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,940
You saw what happened just now.

524
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,699
I just can't stand being looked down on.

525
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:20,079
Especially by Yoo Tae Han and that shaman.

526
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:28,920
Hand over the gun when I ask nicely.

527
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,920
I can't hand this over.

528
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:34,119
Don't you know that
I'll get fired for lending a gun?

529
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,230
Yoo Tae Han doesn't know, does he?

530
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:44,670
That you got him fired.

531
00:47:56,679 --> 00:47:58,610
Officer, you're here!

532
00:48:00,349 --> 00:48:03,789
Come on Officer,
what's there to be surprised about?

533
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:05,949
It's not like you saw something horrible.

534
00:48:06,019 --> 00:48:08,889
What do you mean? I'm not surprised.

535
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,500
Officer, are you sick?
You're sweating so much.

536
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:16,630
I'm wearing long johns.

537
00:48:16,699 --> 00:48:18,800
You know, thermal underwear.

538
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:24,440
Then join us for a drink...

540

Hey, get some intestines ready for him!

541
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,449
Yes, sir!

542
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:34,579
- Have a seat, Officer!
- No, no.

543
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:38,119
It's okay. I just had my meal.

544

545

Gosh, you can't say a word
about the money you borrowed from us,

546
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,599
but still joke so well.

547
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:55,670
About that, just give me one more month.

548

My gosh, that's why.

549
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:03,309
Why do you borrow so much money to gamble?

550
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,610
You can't even gamble well.

551
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:10,019
Forget about all this.
Should I just report you now?

552
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:12,190
Is it 112 or 114?

553
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,559
Sir, it's 112.

554
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:15,920
That's right.

555

556
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:24,429
So please let me go just this once.

what great showmanship you have!

559
00:49:35,409 --> 00:49:38,679
Are you really going to do whatever I say?

560

Hey.

561
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:51,329
I need you to get rid of Yoo Tae Han.

562
00:49:51,889 --> 00:49:53,460
He's a cop as well.

563
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:55,929
How can I get rid of him?

564
00:49:57,570 --> 00:50:00,340
You just need to make a report...

565
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,139
that Yoo Tae Han accepted a bribe.

566
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:05,869
I'll take care of the rest.

567
00:50:06,909 --> 00:50:09,539
If I tell him that you sold him out...

569
