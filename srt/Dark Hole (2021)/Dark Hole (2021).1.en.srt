I will come back.

It's Lee Soo Yeon.

57
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,120
Soo Yeon is back.

58
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,419
Are you sure she's back?

59
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,090
I think you should come
and see for yourself.

60
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,870
The US space agency, NASA announced...

61

that sunspot activity reached the peak
since records began.

62
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,409
The intensity of solar flare...

63
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,110
is at the highest and it's considered
the most dangerous. The world is...

64
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:08,379
What if the world really comes to an end?

65
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,419
That would be great.
I won't have to worry about my mortgage.

66
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,950
Sir, Detective Lee is here.

67
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,360
Hey, what will you do
if Captain finds out about it?

68
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:22,889
Do you want to be suspended...

69
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,659
and be sent to the patrol division again?

70
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,700
But she has to know.

71
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:28,299
Of all officers in this country,

72
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,769
Hwa Seon is the one
who wants to catch the killer the most.

73
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,299
Do you think I don't know that?

74
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,139
I'm just worried her personal emotions
might ruin the case.

75
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,909
But we can't expect her
to sit back and do nothing.

76
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,409
Hey, you're here.

77
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,250
Where's the body?

78
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,320
This way.

79
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,659
Lee Hwa Seon.

80
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,730
Why are you here?

81
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,899
Don't you remember what I told you?

82
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:02,870
I need to see it for myself
to be sure if Soo Yeon's back.

83
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,639
See it for yourself?
Why would you do that?

84
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,409
How many times must I tell you
not to let your emotions get in the way?

85
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,740
This is the eighth victim.

86
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,580
She even murdered my husband.

87
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,850
So how can I not care?

88
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:22,789
Captain, please let me catch her.

89
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,620
You stubborn little...

90
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,230
Captain, she's already here.
Why don't you let her take a...

91
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,559
How dare you.

92
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:31,299
I'm sorry.

93
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:35,129
I just came back from my husband's grave.

94
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,100
You're right.
I am letting my emotions get in the way.

95
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,080
But this is not about
my personal vendetta.

96
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:47,450
I'm doing this because I have
responsibilities as a detective.

97
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,019
All right.

98
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,519
But this is the last time.
Don't forget that.

99
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,190
I won't.

100
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,220
Hwa Seon, it's this way.

101
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,139
Hwa Seon, are you okay?

102
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,539

You said you were going to
buy me jjajangmyeon.

105
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,559
You didn't give me
anything to eat from the morning.

106
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,960
And this is what you give me?

107
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:12,529
Who on earth drives a tow truck
abiding by the traffic laws?

108
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,330
Come to your senses, punk.

109
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,200
How dare you call your boss a punk?

110
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:20,039
Boss, my foot.

111
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,370
I don't care if it's breaking the law.

112

Let's intercept police radio frequency.

Gosh, it smells good.

It seems many vehicles
are also damaged by the accident.

- Let's go.
- Hey, hey.

119
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,159
Gosh, it's hot. You made me spill!

Hyun Ho, what are you doing?

125
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,909
A car accident occured
in front of Jingan underpass.

126

- Oh, all right.
- Yes.

127
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,950
Then I'll start the car.

128

Causing the malfunction
of communication devices.

129
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:07,519
- I'll get going.
- Don't panic.

130
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,190
Threatening the power system and...

131
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,759
My goodness. What's the world coming to?

132
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,129
- Communication devices such as...
- I'll see you later.

133
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:18,059
- Okay, see you later.
- And if they're exposed to the particles,

134
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:20,830
it might cause a communication failure.

135
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,509
Hello there, Officer Park.

136
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,909
That little scumbag.
How did he find me here?

137
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,649
No wonder I wanted to have
kimchi stew today.

138
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,279
I can't believe I bumped into you.

139
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,149
Yes, they serve amazing kimchi stew.
They put a lot of pork in it.

140
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,320
Enjoy.

141
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:43,620
Come on. Don't be like this.

142
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,059
I just want to talk.

143
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,659
I just received a report of an accident.

144
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,830
Officer Park, you must really
think that I'm here for the kimchi stew.

145
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:57,970
Officer Park, aren't we leaving?

146
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,899
Hold on, I'm talking!

147
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,340
Just for one minute, okay?

148
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,149
You know it's already
two days overdue, right?

149
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,590
That? I have the money ready,
so don't worry.

150
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:17,860
I'm serious.

151
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:20,220
That's what you said last time as well,

152
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:22,529
but you paid us one whole week later.

153
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,200
You know I had an unavoidable reason
back then.

154
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:27,029
Tomorrow is the deadline.

155
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:30,330
If you don't wire it till tomorrow,

156
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,740
I'm going to storm into the station
to get the money.

157
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,080
So if you don't want to lose face,

158
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,710
bear what I said in mind.

159
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:46,350
What? Okay. I will.

160
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:00,129
Who is he?

161
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,639
- My alumnus.
- Pardon?

162
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,169
It's nice to see him
after such a long time.

163
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,909
What are you doing? Let's go!

164
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,340
Sure.

166
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,500
Why did you stop?
You should step on the gas!

167
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,840
This is why
tow truck drivers are frowned upon.

168
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,570
Let me frown upon you first.

169
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:47,039
You little scumbag, step on it!
We need to earn money!

170
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,309
Why would you stop here like a lunatic?

171
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:53,179
Let's go! The others are earning money,
you idiot!

172
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,919
You dimwit!

173
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,820
(Taehan Towing)

174
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:03,590
They rushed ahead,
so why did they stop there?

175
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,259
What are you doing?

176
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,569
My goodness.

177
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,250
- Young Bin!
- Yes.

178
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:23,509
You ignored all the signals.

179
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,049
- Did you make a report?
- Yes.

180
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,319
Help me!

181
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:53,640
Are you all right? You can hear me, right?

182
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,609
Please help me, sir.

183
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,509
We called 911, so...

184
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:01,119
I can't breathe. Please.

185
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,130
You'll be okay. Just a second.

186
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,490
Calm down.

187
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:15,599
Calm down and take a deep breath.

188
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18,000
1, 2.

189
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:24,880
You're doing well.

190
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,980
Don't panic.

191
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:29,809
- How pretty.
- Pardon?

192
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,779
You have a dog? What's the name?

193
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:36,720
- Kongchi.
- Kongchi?

194
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:38,190
How old is Kongchi?

195
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:40,789
Just turned three not long ago.

196
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:42,990
That's when dogs are the cutest.

197
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:45,329
My dog's grown old,
and it does nothing but bark.

198
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,630
What is your dog's name?

199
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,000
- My dog?
- Yes.

200
00:18:51,069 --> 00:18:52,200
Young Sik.

201
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,240
- Do you need help?
- It's fine.

202
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,049
Stay away!

203
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,190
- Tae Han!
- It's okay.

204
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:18,500
It's okay.

205
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,869
Tae Han, come out already!

206
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,339
- Come on!
- Pull me when I call you!

207
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,609
It's okay, I'll get you out of here soon.

208
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:33,809
It's almost done!

209
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:36,410
Young Sik!

210
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,420
- In 2, 1...
- In 2, 1...

211
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,230
(Rescue Center)

212
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:06,140
You eat so well. I'm very proud of you.

213
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,349
Is that enough when you've starved
for the whole day?

214
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,910
Want to go for a glass of beer?

215
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,250
No.

216
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,349
All right. Eat as much popcorn
as you like.

217
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:16,650
Give me a second.

218
00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:19,059
Darn it.

219
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,829
What is it?

220
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,500
Whose call are you waiting for?

221
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:32,869
It's nothing.

222
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,240
- A woman?
- What do you take me for?

223
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:37,869
- A shady woman?
- She's not shady!

224
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,279
- Name.
- Yoon Saet Byeol.

225
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:40,740
- From the town?
- From Seoul.

226
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:42,349
- Age?
- 22.

227
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:44,720
Occupation.

228
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:47,549
What is this, are you interrogating me?

229
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,950
Look.

230
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:53,589
Your pupils are shaking.

231
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:58,900
- So she is a shady woman.
- I'm telling you, she's not!

232
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,029
She's an angel!

233
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:26,789
Goodness.

234
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,359
What's this?

235
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:37,789
My gosh.

236
00:22:55,779 --> 00:23:00,019
He is a monster!

237
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,720
He is a monster!

238
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:09,329
He is a monster!

239
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:13,930
He is a monster!

240
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:17,700
He is a monster!

241
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:20,069
It's so awful!

242
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:23,569
How can you let a kid like him
in this school?

243
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,009
Other kids are scared of him!

244
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,440
What are you going to do?

245
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:29,349
Shouldn't you transfer him
to another school or something?

246
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:32,049
My kid doesn't want to go to school
because he's scared of him!

247
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,549
How can I calm down in this state?

248
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:37,220
- How does he look like that?
- Transfer him to another school!

249
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:39,059
Disgusting!

250
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:44,559
Don't look at me, jerk.

251
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:47,200
It's the one and only graduation album.
How unlucky.

252
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,369
- He can't take the hint.
- Get lost!

253
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,740
- Stop.
- You stink, monster. Get lost!

254
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,140
Please stop.

255
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,369
Stay away from him or you'll get infected!

256
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,279
You jerks, stop it!

257
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:02,480
Stop it, you jerks!

258
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:07,150
Please stop already!

259
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,349
You want to take revenge, right?
Let's kill them all with me.

260
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:14,460
Honey.

261
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,700
"Honey", my foot.
You good-for-nothing husband.

262
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,029
What did you just say?

263
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,339
I told you not to look at me like that!

264
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:32,609
Get your face out of here!
Customers won't come because of you!

265
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,349
How dare you run your mouth like that?

266
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,180
I'll gouge your eyes out today!

267
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:50,150
You're home. You must be hungry.

268
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:58,400
Why are you just standing there?

269
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,930
Go and get changed. Let's have dinner.

270
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,019
(Hwa Seon.)

271
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:23,690
(How have you been?)

272
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:28,059
(Are you asleep already?
You're not, are you?)

273
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,190
(I'm sorry I couldn't attend
Sung Beom's funeral.)

274
00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:31,799
(Don't you want to see me, by the way?)

275
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:33,059
(I really want to see you.)

276
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,970
(Oh, right! You want to know
why I killed Sung Beom, right?)

277
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:38,400
(It's because you two thought
you could change me.)

278
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,799
(That really made me sick.)

279
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:41,039
(That's why I killed him.)

280
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,440
(Isn't that awesome?)

281
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:43,869
(Hahahahaha)

282
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,509
What if they had grown
with love from their parents?

283
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,079
Then they wouldn't have gotten
involved in crime,

284
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,779
and they wouldn't have had to live here.

285
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,119
I don't think it's too late for them.

286
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,259
Just like what we did for each other,

287
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,759
won't they be able to change...

288
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,460
if we love and trust them?

289
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:09,369
Hwa Seon. Don't come.

290
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,609
(Come here if you want to see me.)

291
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,640
(I'll be waiting.)

292
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,450
(Come to the place
where Sung Beom proposed to you.)

293
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:23,579
(Hahahahaha)

294
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:31,450
(Hwa Seon)

295
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:19,440
- Why don't you go ahead?
- Okay.

296
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,670
I got a call.

297
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,809
All right.

298
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:41,460
Hey, Hwa Seon.

299
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,359
Jung Hwa, I just texted you a number.

300
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,359
Can you locate this person right now?

301
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,430
Sorry?

302
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,670
Soo Yeon contacted me.

303
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,740
Why don't you leave this to us?

304
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,140
We'll make sure to catch her.

305
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:59,039
No. It's something I must do.

306
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,579
Okay.

307
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,180
I'll call you as soon as
I get the location.

308
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,420
Thank you.

309
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,980
Hwa Seon.

310
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,119
Yes.

311
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,259
I understand how you feel.

312
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,529
So please catch her.

313
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:21,329
(Detective So Jung Hwa)

314
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,769
There you are!

315
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:40,200
Did you think I wouldn't find you
if you hid here?

316
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:42,910
Mom, how did you know I was here?

317
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,710
I know everything.

318
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:47,109
Really? How did you know?

319
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,150
- Do you want to know?
- Yes.

320
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:51,509
I'm so curious that it's driving me crazy.

321
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,490
I found you with your smell.

322
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,119
Really? Do I smell?

323
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,259
But I wash my hair every morning.

324
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,799
It's not a bad smell.
It's a really nice smell.

325
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,700
- Really?
- Of course.

326
00:32:08,869 --> 00:32:11,329
It's the nicest smell in the world.

327
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,000
Did you finish your homework?

328
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:20,579
- 7 times 8.
- 56.

329
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,710
- 9 times 7.
- 63.

330
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:22,779
2 times 2.

331
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:24,779
Four.

332
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,619
- Impressive, Do Yoon.
- Do I get fried chicken?

333
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,750
Fried chicken?

334
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,390
Fried chicken?

335
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:33,119
- Ta-da!
- Yes!

336
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,930
Are you that happy?

337
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,700
Yes. You're the best!

338
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:39,900
I'm the best?

339
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:42,029
You're the best too!

340
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:59,420
Hey, it looks like it's going to pour.

341
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:01,349
You're right.

342
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,890
I'm worried.

343
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,220
What are you worried about?
You live 10 minutes away.

344
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,430
No, I meant Ji Hye.

345
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,630
What about your wife?

346
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,769
Ji Hye gets easily scared.

347
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,339
She gets startled even when she's asleep
when I fart.

348
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:23,970
Is that so? You must be happy
to be a newlywed.

349
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:26,509
It must be great.
It's the happiest time of your life.

350
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,750
- When's the due date again?
- It's next Monday.

351
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:33,119
Oh, wow. Then you'll be a dad soon?

352
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,319
Dad?

353
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:37,089
Are you that happy?

354
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,420
You know, your life is over now.

355
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,089
- Don't you get it?
- I do.

356
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,730
Goodness me, are you that happy?

357
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:48,329
- My goodness.
- Please just go.

358
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,869
I'm leaving. Keep up the good work.

359
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,430
Get home safely.

360
00:33:53,539 --> 00:33:56,140
- Officer Park.
- What? You startled me.

361
00:33:56,339 --> 00:33:58,880
- The lady from the beauty salon.
- The beauty salon?

362
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,109
Her husband, Mr. Nam
goes around picking medicinal herbs.

363
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,609
What about her? Did he hit her again?

364
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,349
I don't think so.

365
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,319
She said Mr. Nam hasn't come home yet.

366
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,880
And he's not answering his phone.

367
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,820
Well, just tell her to wait.

368
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,590
I'm sure he's somewhere gambling.

369
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:15,989
And he's going to show up
in the morning all drunk.

370
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,460
- I'm leaving now.
- Okay. Get home safely.

371
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:12,349
- Please help us.
- Help us.

372
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:35,940
Oh, no. What happened?

373
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,239
She's bleeding.

374
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:38,570
- What happened?
- My goodness.

375
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,449
Ma'am.

376
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:52,920
- Get off me.
- Pardon?

377
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,929
I said get off me!

378
00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:03,230
I heard she was losing her divine power.
I guess they were right.

379
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,030
Do you think we can get our money back?

380
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:07,440
Of course. We spent a fortune on this.

381
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:10,670
If she doesn't,
I'm going to sue her for fraud.

382
00:36:10,739 --> 00:36:12,739
My goodness. Excuse me.

383
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,380
We can get our money back, right?

384
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:18,809
Listen to me carefully.

385
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:22,389
I'm a freelance worker.
An independent contractor.

386
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:26,159
That means I may not get paid. Got it?

387
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:30,130
- My goodness.
- What rotten luck!

388
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:33,230
- Gosh, what do we do?
- What terrible luck!

389
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,059
- Let's just go.
- Come on.

390
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,130
My gosh.

391
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:40,099
Gosh, I can't believe this.

392
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,309
Let the spirit possess you.

393
00:36:48,909 --> 00:36:52,110
If you don't,
you and your mother will both die.

394
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,900
Come in.

395
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,440
The shaman is waiting for you.

396
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,550
Promise me.

397
00:37:33,789 --> 00:37:35,889
I'll let you possess me,

398
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:40,199
so promise me you'll make me
the strongest divinity.

399
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:45,699
Promise me you'll never
let anyone mistreat me!

400
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,650
You said you'd protect me.

401
00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:01,550
You said you'd never leave me
and protect me!

402
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,500
I'll gouge her eyes out.

403
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:57,309
I'll gouge her eyes out.

404
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,900
The explosion of sunspots seems serious.

405
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,869
When sunspots explode,

406
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,269
the x-ray of the earth can cause...

407
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:30,139
malfunction of short wave transmission
and disrupt GPS signals.

408
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:34,579
High energy particles
could damage solar panels...

409
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:38,750
or cause serious damage
to the power system on the ground.

410
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,880
It could cause power failure...

411
00:39:41,949 --> 00:39:44,250
or paralyze the communication system
and banking system.

412
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,699
Hit-and-run at Muji Intersection.
The suspect is on the loose.

413
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:56,400
Send backup to the cathedral.

414
00:39:56,469 --> 00:39:58,699
Hit-and-run at Muji Intersection.
The suspect is on the loose.

415
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,340
Send backup to the cathedral.

416
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,340
You will never find him there.

417
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,239
You should move towards the post office.

418
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:45,239
(Hwa Seon)

419
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,619
(Morgue)

420
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:47,170
(Detective So Jung Hwa)

421
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:53,139
- Yes.
- Hwa Seon.

422
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:54,980
I found the cell phone owner.

423
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,250
Where is she right now?

424
00:42:56,309 --> 00:42:59,349
But Lee Soo Yeon isn't the owner.

425
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,420
The owner's name is Kim Bo Eun.

426
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,619
Kim Bo Eun?

427
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:05,420
Yes, she's a nurse at Muji Hospital.

428
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:17,599
Pick up the phone!

429
00:43:17,769 --> 00:43:20,369
I don't want to. I'm off duty today.

430
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,409
Pick it up before you get scolded
by Officer Park!

431
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,340
Hello?

432
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,380
What?

433
00:43:29,909 --> 00:43:32,050
Yes, I'll go there immediately.

434
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,389
What's happening?

435
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:39,150
What? It's just...

436
00:43:40,059 --> 00:43:41,389
Just something bad.

437
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,789
What bad thing can happen
in this small town?

438
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:44,989
I can't tell you.

439
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:47,400
Our baby shouldn't hear it. Don't mind it.

440
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,400
See you later.

441
00:43:57,309 --> 00:43:58,909
Daddy will be back.

442
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,179
I'll be back.

443
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,039
See you later!

444
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:07,519
What a scene.

445
00:44:07,849 --> 00:44:10,550
There's nothing to see here. Go back!

446
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:12,690
Hey, you shouldn't take photos.

447
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:14,590
- I want to take photos.
- Go back home!

448
00:44:14,659 --> 00:44:16,889
I said go back. There's nothing to see.

449
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,760
Hello, Chief. This is Park Soon Il.

450
00:44:20,829 --> 00:44:23,869
The victims are one female and...

451
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:25,429
Yes, the forensics are here.

452
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,500
Yes.

453
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,710
- Yes.
- Excuse me.

454
00:44:31,139 --> 00:44:34,809
(Police)

455
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,849
Did you find the eyeball?

456
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,389
Not yet!

457
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,340
Yes.

458
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,500
Yes, sir.

459
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:04,539
Yes, sir!

460
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,110
It got on me!

461
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:09,210
It splashed on me!

462
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:12,650
I'm sorry.

463
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,989
Officer Cho, get yourself together!

464
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,250
You're a cop!

465
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:24,190
Officer Park,
why did he gouge out his wife's eyes?

466
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:25,730
How would I know that?

467
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:28,059
He probably hated the sight of his wife.

468
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:29,130
What?

469
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,369
You don't need to know
since you're still a newlywed.

470
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,320
If we come back empty-handed again today,
I'm going to quit this job.

471
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,949
We're late because you pooped.

472
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:53,590
I couldn't help it, I had a stomachache!

473
00:45:53,659 --> 00:45:55,559
You're so heartless.

474
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,630
You're too talkative today, Young Sik.

475
00:46:03,429 --> 00:46:04,429
What's that?

476
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,969
Did Jun Seok pay you chicken feed
to catch wild boars?

477
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:11,070
That's so embarrassing.
Stop doing things like this.

478
00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:12,880
I need to at least do things like this
to give you a salary.

479
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,639
- Why, should I not give you one?
- That's not what I meant.

480
00:46:16,409 --> 00:46:17,909
It's just as you said.

481
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,719
What's there to be embarrassed about
when earning money?

482
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,179
Before the wild boars ruin all the crops,

483
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,719
do your best to get rid of them.

484
00:46:23,789 --> 00:46:24,789
Wait.

485
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:26,619
(Taehan Towing)

486
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,760
I think it's around here.

487
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:30,289
Let's search for it.

488
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,960
Why did a car break down in a mountain?

489
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:34,559
That doesn't matter for us.

490
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:49,139
- What is it?
- My stomach's acting up again.

491
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:51,809
- It's about to come out!
- Again?

492
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,389
I should fire him.

493
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,360
Hello?

494
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:02,389
Yes, I'm the tow truck driver.

495
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,230
I'm almost there.

496
00:47:04,429 --> 00:47:05,429
Hello?

497
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:07,230
Hello?

498
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:12,329
What was that?

499
00:47:13,769 --> 00:47:15,969
Gosh, one thing after another.

500
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,389
What's this?

501
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:39,699
Is this a meteorite?

502
00:47:44,969 --> 00:47:47,539
Young Sik! Are you done pooping?

503
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:51,510
It'll be bad
if you get attacked by a wild boar!

504
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:02,820
Hey!

505
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:06,389
What are you doing fully clothed?

506
00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:08,320
Did you poop your pants?

507
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:13,800
Hey.

508
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:16,300
It's fine.

509
00:48:23,739 --> 00:48:24,739
Tae Han.

510
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,880
Please save me.

511
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:31,610
Young Sik.

512
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,780
What happened to your eyes?

513
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:42,559
Don't come closer!

514
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,389
I said don't come closer!

515
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,760
What are you talking about?

516
00:48:47,829 --> 00:48:48,929
Go away!

517
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:52,530
Hey.

518
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:54,440
- Go away!
- Are you insane?

519
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,079
Young Sik!

520
00:49:06,579 --> 00:49:07,579
Are you okay?

521
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:09,250
Young Sik?

522
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,789
(Muji Hospital)

523
00:49:10,849 --> 00:49:12,489
Please make way!

524
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:16,190
Please make way. Sorry!

525
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,000
Detective Lee Hwa Seon?

526
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:24,800
You called us, right?

527
00:49:25,869 --> 00:49:26,869
Yes.

528
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:30,340
I'm Detective Lee Hwa Seon.

529
00:49:30,409 --> 00:49:31,409
I see.

530
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:35,380
You lost your phone recently, right?

531
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,809
Well, yes.

532
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:44,250
Is this the one?

533
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:46,989
It is!

534
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,019
How did you find it?

535
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,030
Do you remember when you lost it?

536
00:49:55,530 --> 00:50:00,840
Well, I think it was about a week ago.

537
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:03,610
I was about to get off work,

538
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:05,840
and a lady asked to borrow my phone,

539
00:50:05,909 --> 00:50:07,280
so I lent it to her.

540
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:11,780
I'm so sorry, but can I borrow your phone
for a second?

541
00:50:11,849 --> 00:50:14,449
I forgot to bring mine.

542
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,949
Well... Sure.

543
00:50:18,289 --> 00:50:19,289
Here.

544
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,260
Ms. Ki!

545
00:50:25,659 --> 00:50:27,000
You surprised me!

546
00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:28,329
Where are you going at this hour?

547
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,000
My daughter's sick at home,
so I'm getting off work early.

548
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,099
You should go back quickly, then.

549
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:34,039
- I'll be on my way.
- Thanks for your hard work.

550
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,369
What?

551
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,780
I lent my phone to her,

552
00:50:40,809 --> 00:50:42,710
and while I was talking
with another nurse,

553
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,179
she disappeared with the phone.

554
00:50:51,349 --> 00:50:53,460
Is it her?

555
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,360
Well...

556
00:50:57,159 --> 00:50:58,230
I'm not sure.

557
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:01,860
I think she did have
long and straight hair.

558
00:51:03,369 --> 00:51:06,329
My daughter was sick that day,

559
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:08,869
so I wasn't really paying attention
because I was rushing.

560
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:16,179
- Excuse me, please make way!
- Make way!

561
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:18,449
- Excuse me, make way!
- Make way!

562
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:31,059
- Sir, can you hear me?
- Let me go.

563
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,190
He's 43°C.

564
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:33,829
- Let me go!
- Prepare a sedative.

565
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:35,099
What happened?

566
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:36,230
Maybe he ate something strange
on the mountain,

567
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,469
but he suddenly turned like that.

568
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,570
Sir, let me put on a ventilator for you.

569
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:43,269
Don't come closer!

570
00:51:43,539 --> 00:51:44,940
- Sir. Nurse!
- I said don't come closer!

571
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:46,070
Don't come closer!

572
00:51:46,139 --> 00:51:47,610
He's hallucinating
and showing signs of a seizure.

573
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:48,710
Call neurosurgery.

574
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:49,780
Okay.

575
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:02,059
Father, I'm sorry!

576
00:52:02,489 --> 00:52:04,190
Please don't hit me!

577
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,789
Father, please don't hit me!

578
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,360
Don't hit me!

579
00:52:08,329 --> 00:52:10,030
Hey, calm down. What's the matter?

580
00:52:10,099 --> 00:52:11,900
My father's here!

581
00:52:11,969 --> 00:52:14,170
Your father passed away long ago.
Get a grip!

582
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:15,699
Father!

583
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,710
Nurse!

584
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:21,079
Hey!

585
00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:22,309
It hurts!

586
00:52:23,809 --> 00:52:24,809
No!

587
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,579
What about CCTV footage?

588
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,619
Actually,

589
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,320
the one on this floor broke down,
so it's being repaired now.

590
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,190
Father...

591
00:52:37,489 --> 00:52:38,929
Father...

592
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,059
Catch him!

593
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:46,840
Don't hit me!

594
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,400
Please don't hit me!

595
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,440
Can you call the police?

596
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,039
- Don't come closer! Don't come!
- What's wrong with him?

597
00:53:04,489 --> 00:53:06,789
Honey. What happened?

598
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:09,360
Oh, dear... What do I do?

599
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:19,969
Don't come closer.

600
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,570
Don't come closer.

601
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,679
I said, don't come closer.

602
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:32,579
Why did you suddenly jump into the road?

603
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:34,349
Don't come closer.

604
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:36,920
Are you hurt?

605
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:41,719
Hey!

606
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:55,769
- Tell him to stay away.
- What's wrong with you?

607
00:53:58,909 --> 00:54:01,039
- Are you okay?
- Don't come closer!

608
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,449
- Young Sik. Hey!
- What's wrong with him?

609
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:05,150
- What was that?
- Young Sik!

610
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,679
My gosh.

611
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,449
It looked like he was badly hurt.

612
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:13,190
- What happened?
- He just walked away.

613
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,559
That was so strange.

614
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,099
Tell me.

615
00:54:24,099 --> 00:54:26,300
What did I do so wrong?

616
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:30,739
I accepted you so you wouldn't
kill my mom.

617
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:35,679
You tormented me so much.

618
00:54:36,409 --> 00:54:38,050
So why are you doing this now?

619
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:41,920
Why did you abandon me?

620
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:45,820
Tell me.

621
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,860
Will you just tell me?

622
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:26,659
Young Sik!

623
00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:30,730
Nam Young Sik!

624
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:33,539
Darn it!

625
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:11,369
My gosh! Some lunatic
suddenly jumped in front of our car!

626
00:56:11,539 --> 00:56:14,610
And he just ran off
after shoving my husband!

627
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:17,809
I think it's the same guy
the hospital called about.

628
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,449
Where did that lunatic run off to?

629
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:20,849
To the mountains!

630
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,119
- To the mountains?
- Yes.

631
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:24,289
Darn it. Why did he... Okay.

632
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:26,920
- What are you waiting for? Let's go.
- Okay.

633
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:29,059
Hey! I'll drive.

634
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:30,250
Excuse me.

635
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:42,820
Don't you want to kill her?

636
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:44,829
Get back at her.

637
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:52,269
Kill her! Kill her right now!

638
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:56,469
Why are you hesitating? Kill her.

639
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:59,809
She killed your husband!

640
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,579
Lee Soo Yeon.

641
00:59:11,449 --> 00:59:12,719
Lee Soo Yeon.

642
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:21,260
Why did you do that?

643
00:59:33,139 --> 00:59:35,639
Why on earth did you kill him?

644
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:39,409
(All child actors underwent
psychological therapy while filming.)

645
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:42,280
(We thank Ahn Eun Jin
for her special appearance.)

646
01:00:00,269 --> 01:00:02,500
(Dark Hole)

647
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:05,909
Don't be afraid. You have been chosen.

648
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:07,539
You'll get to see him soon.

649
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:09,210
What did you see in the hole?

650
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,780
My friend's eyes turned black like you
and became all weird.

651
01:00:11,849 --> 01:00:13,920
I saw the serial killer
who killed my husband.

652
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:14,980
Lee Soo Yeon!

653
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:18,119
Black eyes, black blood.
They're not human.

654
01:00:23,789 --> 01:00:24,829
Get in now!

655
01:00:25,429 --> 01:00:26,230
Mom!

656
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:27,829
Hwa Seon.
