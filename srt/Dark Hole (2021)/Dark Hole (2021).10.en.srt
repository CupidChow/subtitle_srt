12
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,870
You know the driver
of this unregistered truck, right?

13
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:10,409
You've been grilling me for days.

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,810
We don't use unregistered trucks.

15
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,349
Someone saw this truck
coming in and out of this place.

16
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,480
You know the driver, don't you?

17
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,859
Who told you that?
Let me see that person's face.

18
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:27,390
If you keep doing this,
I won't just sit still.

19
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:29,890
I'll have to file a complaint
to your precinct.

20
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,659
Wait.

21
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:34,799
My brother died in the accident.

22
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,939
- Is he badly hurt?
- Oh, no.

23
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,450
- He's bleeding so much.
- Somebody call 911.

24
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,280
- I think we should call 911.
- We're at...

25
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:52,950
- Call 911.
- There was an accident.

26
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,489
It really wasn't me!

27
00:01:58,189 --> 00:01:59,689
You're just the same.

28
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,730
You should believe me
even if no one else does.

29
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,260
That's family!

30
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:05,829
How dare you talk back at me?

31
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,769
I just went there to play a game.

32
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,830
I kept our promise!

33
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,800
- Oh, no...
- His helmet came off.

34
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,319
Kang Soo.

35
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,810
Please give me a call
if you hear anything.

36
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,750
Please, I beg you.

37
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:58,319
Please call me.

38
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,189
I don't know anything.

39
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,960
He should be catching a culprit.
Why does he keep tormenting me?

40
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,599
He's such a nuisance.

41
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,370
So why did you have to drink
in broad daylight?

42
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,569
He's the older brother
of the kid you killed.

43
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:23,039
It looks like he'll keep following you.
What are you going to do?

44
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:26,949
What else?
I should make him stop following me.

45
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,280
How?

46
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,650
I'll strip him...

47
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:35,990
of his title as a cop.

48
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,830

57
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:17,879
What happened?

58
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,350
Well, that's...

59
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,389
The ICU ran out of medicine and food.

60
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,759
They're offering us supplies,
so let's take them first.

61
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,329
You were causing all the fuss
to kill us a moment ago.

62
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,699
What are you up to now?

63
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,470
We're welcoming you as our guest...

64
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,480
only because he gave you
a chance to repent.

65
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,709
So accept him before it's too late.

66
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,779
Then you can live.

67
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,250
(Book In, Book Out)

68
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,730
Don't be ridiculous.

69
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:40,829
You're only
being controlled by the monster.

70
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,300
That's not true.

71
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:49,040
I'm the only one
who's really chosen by him.

72
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,250
Will the people in the lobby be safe?

73
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,350
I don't think anyone here is safe.

74
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,220
Then what was that scream about?

75
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:10,389
Dong Rim, can you go inside
and help the kids?

76
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:12,160
Sure.

77
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,639
The shaman's followers
who attacked us were killed.

78
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,110
Did the infected kill them?

79
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,509
No, it wasn't them.

80
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,180
We should get inside and talk.

81
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,490
(Police)

82
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,960
Shaman.

83
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
Well...

84
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:53,909
are you going to
keep feeding those punks?

85
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:56,769
There isn't much food left for us.

86
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,480
Don't worry. It's going to end soon.

87
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,120
Is that true? Is it going to end soon?

88
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,090
He told me.

89
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,889
He said everything is going to end soon.

90
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,840
So tell me. What's going on?

91
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,240
The infected didn't kill
the shaman's followers.

92
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:35,649
It was the monster's tentacle.

93
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,049
The monster I saw before we
went to the supermarket.

94
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,019
Tae Han, what is she talking about?

95
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,389
The monster's tentacle?

96
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,019
When we went to the 5th floor
to find the survivors,

97
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,830
remember what I said
after receiving her radio message?

98
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,399
Yes, Detective.

99
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,799
I know it's hard to believe,

100
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,600
but I saw something in the smoke.

101
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:58,500
The black smoke isn't the end of it.

102
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
What?

103
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,309
I told you there's
something in the black smoke.

104
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,610
Yes.

105
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:10,549
That something is the monster that
controls the smoke and the infected.

106
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,720
What? What are you saying?

107
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,820
Are you saying the monster is here?

108
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:21,289
Then shouldn't we
get out of here right now?

109
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:22,960
There's no use in running.

110
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:26,100
Because it's been following us.

111
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,169
What are you...

112
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,539
I saw its tentacle first at the school.

113
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,850
We got out of the school.

114
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:52,059
Then I saw it again
at the residential office.

115
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:01,230
The next time I saw it
was at the supermarket.

116
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:12,179
Then I saw it at the hospital just now.

117
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:27,019
Are you saying it's been following us
since we were at the school?

118
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,830
I don't think
it was all just a coincidence.

119
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:33,960
But how did it follow us
without anyone knowing?

120
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,700
I guess it's intelligent...

121
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:40,669
considering how it came to the lobby
through the ventilator.

122
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,049
Excuse me.

123
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:49,909
What is it?

124
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,649
So does that woman
really have divine powers?

125
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:57,350
How dare you call her that?

126
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,320
- Then what is she?
- She's not just a woman.

127
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:02,460
She's the shaman
chosen by the higher being.

128
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,159
Chosen?

129
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,600
Didn't you see when you came here?

130
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:09,330
The smoke can't come near.

131
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:11,039
Right? You can't see the smoke, right?

132
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,340
It's very clear.

133
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,309
It's all thanks to the shaman.

134
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,740
Also, that's not the only thing
she can do.

135
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:20,539
She even knows who will die.

136
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,450
- She's right.
- Totally.

137
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:24,250
Is that true?

138
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:28,149
Don't get in trouble
after choosing the wrong side...

139
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,620
and come to us.

140
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,059
It's the only way you can survive.

141
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,559
You ignorant people. Let's go.

142
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,629
Yes.

143
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,200
But if the monster
ran away to the lobby,

144
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:44,340
there's no way
we couldn't have seen it, right?

145
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,970
He's right. We didn't know
what the shaman will do...

146
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,470
so we were watching closely.

147
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,210
But why do you think it chose
to run towards the lobby,

148
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,909
risking the higher chance
of being caught?

149
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,519
What if it's safer for it
when there are many people around?

150
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,559
When I got to the hallway,
the ventilator was smashed.

151
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:11,629
There was nowhere for it to hide
except for the lobby.

152
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,799
I know. Then where did it hide?

153
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,009
Maybe it isn't hiding somewhere.

154
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,039
Maybe it's hiding in someone.

155
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,710
What?

156
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:32,279
Are you saying it's using
a human body as a host?

157
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,519
If I'm right about this,

158
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:40,659
the lobby packed with people
must've been the best place to hide.

159
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:44,129
From the school to the hospital...

160
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:46,700
it's been following us. That means...

161
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,700
Among the survivors who were
with us from the school,

162
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:54,240
there must be the monster's host.

163
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:55,539
You're right.

164
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,779
When we were attacked by the monster,

165
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,379
there were people who weren't with us.

166
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,649
Who are they?

167
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,620
Wait a minute.

168
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,519
We know nothing about this monster.

169
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,519
So we can't suspect people
based on speculation.

170
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,799
To tell you the truth,

171
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,039
I inhaled the black smoke.

172
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,820
Soon Il, let's listen to her first.

173
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,679
She just said she inhaled the smoke.

174
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,789
What will you do if she gets infected?

175
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,990
Not everyone
who inhaled the smoke changes.

176
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,490
After I inhaled the smoke,
I heard the monster's voice.

177
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:53,529
Sometimes, I can see
what the infected are seeing.

178
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:57,330
As if I'm connected
to the monster somehow.

179
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,899
How am I supposed to believe you?

180
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,740
She's telling the truth.

181
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,009
She's been helping us
and she never once attacked us.

182
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,149
When the infected stepped back
at the school,

183
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,519
do you remember
me hearing a high-pitch sound?

184
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,000
The monster makes that sound
when it controls the infected.

185
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:35,740
We are survivors
who came from somewhere else.

186
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,080
Oh, right.

187
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,679
When you were in trouble on the rooftop,

188
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:48,519
I saw you through the shaman's eyes.

189
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:00,529
That's how I could get to the rooftop.

190
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,340
Does that mean the shaman
inhaled the smoke as well?

191
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,500
Yes, I'm sure of it.

192
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:12,409
Well, it's confusing to me too.

193
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,210
But it's true that she saved our lives.

194
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,480
So let's trust her.

195
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:25,259
So Inspector, who are the people...

196
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,990
who weren't there?

197
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:37,700
They're Dong Rim and Na Se Na.

198
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,240
It's not Dong Rim.

199
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,639
You know better than anyone.
She doesn't have any symptoms.

200
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,110
I know that, but...

201
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,649
they are the only ones who were
separated from us and came back.

202
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,149
So no one knows what happened to them.

203
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,700
Hyun Ho.

204
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Ji Hye.

205
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,470
Not everyone
who inhaled the black smoke changes.

206
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,670
Are you serious?

207
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:21,039
I'm serious. A detective here...

208
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:23,809
inhaled the black smoke,
but she didn't get infected.

209
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:27,349
So will I really not get infected?

210
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:28,619
No.

211
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:32,759
So please hang in there a little longer.

212
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,559
Okay.

213
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:43,869
Here.

214
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,299
What about you?

215
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,009
I'm fine. Eat up.

216
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,609
My mom said...

217
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,309
if we share food, it means we're family.

218
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:00,819
Family?

219
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,920
So let's eat together.

220
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:07,119
Family? That means
I'm your older brother!

221
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,960
Hey, we are the same age!

222
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:12,059
You said your birthday is in November!
Mine's in April.

223
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,700
Call me brother from now on.

224
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,670
Hey, stop saying nonsense!

225
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:18,339
How dare you call your brother "Hey"?
That's rude.

226
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,119
Ms. Na!

227
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:49,170
No. No.

228
00:18:57,539 --> 00:18:59,839
If people find out
that you're a murderer,

229
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,009
what will they think of you?

230
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,680
Murderer! You killed my dad.

231
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:09,349
No, I'm not a murderer.

232
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:12,059
Will people believe you?

233
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:15,390
It's true that you lied.

234
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,200
You're the same! You lied.

235
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:20,859
You might as well have killed him
yourself.

236
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:23,769
(Muji Police Station)

237
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,819
You're a murderer.

238
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,329
(Police)

239
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,230
Hyun Ho, that guy's back again.

240
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:58,369
He's going to take Him Chan away.

241
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,170
Go away. Go away!

242
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:04,839
I'll go to the toilet, so stay here.

243
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:05,980
- Okay.
- Okay.

244
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:25,930
Ji Hye.

245
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:31,839
You did well.

246
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,240
It's okay.

247
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,910
Why are you hesitating?
You can just kill her first.

248
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,450
Hurry up and kill her.

249
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:49,420
Kill her!

250
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:06,470
So you're saying that
those two might be the hosts,

251
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:08,769
so we should keep an eye on them, right?

252
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:11,710
Yes. There's a high chance
that's the case.

253
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,079
What's the matter?

254
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:22,220
The music teacher is acting strange.

255
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,819
What do you mean?

256
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,990
Well...

257
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,789
She suddenly grabbed a pair of scissors
and went after Dong Rim.

258
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,099
Dong Rim.

259
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,000
Are you in here?

260
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:44,740
It's fine.

261
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,410
It's just me.

262
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,920
Can we talk?

263
00:21:58,089 --> 00:21:59,890
So what I said was right.

264
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,289
Murderer.

265
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,000
(Restricted Area)

266
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:13,000
No. I'm not!

267
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:28,390
No... I'm not...

268
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,130
Dong Rim!

269
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,960
- What are you doing?
- Are you all right?

270
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:38,960
Not me.

271
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:41,799
Dong Rim, are you all right?

272
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,740
It wasn't me.

273
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:52,339
It wasn't me.

274
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,410
Not me.

275
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:00,549
Stay here for a while.

276
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,690
Please don't do this.

277
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,759
I'm not infected.

278
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:07,190
Please listen to me.

279
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:09,690
Please believe me!

280
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:12,730
It wasn't me!

281
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,029
I didn't do it!

282
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:17,730
It wasn't me!

283
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:19,470
Please.

284
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,970
- Is it okay to do this?
- Excuse me!

285
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,609
It's true that she is dangerous.

286
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,450
Then shouldn't we do something
about that detective as well?

287
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:33,150
Let's go.

288
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,549
(Storage Room)

289
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,490
Thankfully, the wound isn't too deep.

290
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,000
Tell me if you need anything.

291
00:23:57,339 --> 00:23:59,579
What happened between you two?

292
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,210
Mr. Choi, can you step outside
for a moment?

293
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,539
Oh, sure.

294
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:44,450
Nobody told me anything.

295
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,660
Nobody.

296
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,970
Ms. Na, please tell me.

297
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,910
You knew about my dad's accident!

298
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:06,410
I have nothing to say. It's just like
what I said to the police.

299
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,410
Stop lying!

300
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,380
I know you lied to the police.

301
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,579
You're such a strange girl, aren't you?

302
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:16,720
What did I even lie about?

303
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,319
Are you even a teacher?

304
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:25,400
No, are you even human?

305
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,009
You're a monster.

306
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:38,579
You're a monster just like them.

307
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,450
I'll catch them.

308
00:25:52,589 --> 00:25:54,559
When the world is back to normal,

309
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,890
I will catch the hit-and-run driver...

310
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,130
and make sure they are punished.

311
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,470
Really?

312
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:06,039
I promise.

313
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,109
In return, promise me something as well.

314
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:17,109
If something unknown and strange
is happening to you right now,

315
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:20,349
will you tell me?

316
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,329
Are you all right?

317
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:40,299
Yes, I'm all right.

318
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:44,309
My head hurt for a while.

319
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:56,549
I did everything you wanted.

320
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,859
So please tell me.

321
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,859
Tell me that the person you chose...

322
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:06,400
is not her, but me.

323
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,869
What are you doing?

324
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:18,480
You know it too.

325
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:22,910
I'm the only shaman
who's capable of serving you.

326
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:25,319
Do you think you can handle me?

327
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,349
Why would you say that?

328
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:33,259
Why can't you be satisfied with just me?

329
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,230
Stay still until I give you a command.

330
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:38,430
Unless you want to die, that is.

331
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,240
It's because of that wench.

332
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:55,210
This is all because of that lowly wench!

333
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:03,420
What did you do with the teacher?

334
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,160
We locked her in the storage.

335
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:08,529
Why did she try to kill the girl though?

336
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:10,859
Maybe the teacher
tried to kill the girl...

337
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,099
because she found out that she's a host.

338
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,240
I think we should block
the ventilation shafts first.

339
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,670
And then?

340
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:27,009
We should look for a place
to hide in case something happens.

341
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:29,880
The whole city is filled with smoke.

342
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:31,450
How will we find one?

343
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:36,650
The hospital recently purchased a drone
for medical use, didn't they?

344
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,319
Yes, there's one.

345
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:46,329
Then the detective and I will
go up to the rooftop to look around.

346
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,900
The rest of you should
block the ventilation shafts.

347
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,099
Then I'll go to the ER
and bring the drone.

348
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,799
You two should go upstairs first.

349
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,109
Be careful.

350
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,880
(Storage Room)

351
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:09,690
Is someone in there?

352
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,460
Please get me out of here!

353
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,289
- Ms. Na?
- Yes. Yes, it's me!

354
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,829
Why are you locked up in there?

355
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:21,700
People locked me up.

356
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:24,000
Please get me out!

357
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:33,579
Hold on.

358
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,410
What happened?

359
00:29:36,579 --> 00:29:39,819
The teacher inside
tried to hurt Dong Rim.

360
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,920
That's why we locked her up.

361
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:47,589
There's nothing to worry.
You should head back inside.

362
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,730
Oh, okay.

363
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,460
(Police)

364
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,690
Let's get going.

365
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,859
I'll go up.

366
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,569
- Please hold the chair.
- Okay.

367
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,910
They're locking people up now?

368
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,220
What are you talking about?

369
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:49,119
They locked Ms. Na in the storage.

370
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,960
What? They locked up Ms. Na?

371
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:54,789
Yes, I was on my way back
from the toilet,

372
00:30:54,859 --> 00:30:56,259
and I heard her in the storage.

373
00:30:56,329 --> 00:30:57,829
Why?

374
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:00,630
They said they locked her up
because she's dangerous,

375
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,329
but who knows?
They might be up to something.

376
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:07,140
They could lock us up if we cross them.

377
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,200
Don't you think?

378
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:10,740
What's happening?

379
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:18,079
That's good. Get off the chair now.

380
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:22,190
It looks... It looks too flimsy.
I don't think this will do.

381
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,049
Is there some plywood laying around?

382
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:27,119
Then I'll go and see
if there's something better.

383
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,660
- Okay.
- We'd be grateful.

384
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:31,529
- We'll wrap up here.
- Okay.

385
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:32,799
Let me see.

386
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:34,099
- Hold the chair.
- Okay.

387
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,269
This is too weak.
You only made it look pretty.

388
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:40,569
Gosh, what is this? This is useless!

389
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,410
- Why did you take it off?
- Gosh.

390
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,569
(Restricted Area)

391
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,619
- What are you doing?
- It's not me.

392
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:57,690
Dong Rim.

393
00:31:58,990 --> 00:31:59,990
Are you all right?

394
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,059
(First-aid Drone)

395
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:10,990
(Emergency Center)

396
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:29,450
The smoke has backed off.

397
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:33,619
It was like that at the school.

398
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:50,599
(First-aid Drone)

399
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:25,369
Hold on. Can you move it
toward the light?

400
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,420
Where is this place?

401
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,820
It looks like a chemical plant.

402
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,690
(GPS Error)

403
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,239
(GPS Error)

404
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:16,219
(GPS Error)

405
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,789
What did we just see?

406
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,659
He was wearing a mask.

407
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,190
There's a survivor.

408
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:27,360
(Muji Chemical)

409
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:34,340
I think it'd be safer
to be in the lobby.

410
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:35,969
Are you going to the lobby?

411
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:38,539
You should think carefully
if you don't want to be locked up.

412
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:42,139
The shaman said we must
come before him to live.

413
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,789
Darn it, I'm going too.

414
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,030
You too?

415
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,989
He said
they locked up Ms. Na in storage.

416
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,159
The people here are even weirder.

417
00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:10,940
Do Yoon, don't you think
they're just a bunch of traitors?

418
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:15,480
Don't they know what the detective
went through to save us?

419
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:28,820
This is going to take forever.
Just smash it.

420
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:30,090
Here. Let's use the hammer.

421
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:32,929
Wait, wait.

422
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:35,260
Where are you going?

423
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:37,000
We're going to stay in the lobby.

424
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,340
You can't go there.
It's much safer here.

425
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,269
I can't say this place is safer.

426
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:46,280
Get a grip!
You're all being fooled by that shaman!

427
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,179
Watch what you say.

428
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:50,780
Who are you to tell us what to do?

429
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:52,650
I decide where I go.

430
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:53,719
Let's go.

431
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,820
What are you doing?

432
00:36:59,889 --> 00:37:01,820
Don't mind us. Step aside.

433
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:06,030
Fine, whatever.
Only adversity makes a man wise.

434
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,969
Kids, don't be like this.

435
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:11,670
I'm sorry, Mr. Choi.

436
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:27,050
(Storage Room)

437
00:37:58,349 --> 00:37:59,650
What is it?

438
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:09,789
It's nothing.

439
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,440
Wait a minute.

440
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:30,179
(Storage Room)

441
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,519
Have you seen Ms. Na in the storage?

442
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,090
She cut the handcuffs and disappeared.

443
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,389
What? Then do you think she...
Did the tentacles...

444
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,159
The tentacles cut them off.
How else can a normal person do it?

445
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:16,929
We don't know how it happened yet.

446
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:19,300
Block the ventilators first.

447
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,760
Wait.

448
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:23,670
So did you find something
with the drone?

449
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:28,340
I think there's a survivor
at the chemical plant.

450
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,840
A survivor?

451
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,980
I don't think it was an infected
but I can't be sure it's safe there.

452
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,909
But it'll be safer than here.

453
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,550
Let's just go there.

454
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:40,320
There is a crazy shaman, the infected,
and a monster in this place.

455
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:42,550
A monster?

456
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:47,260
What do you mean?

457
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,269
Give me your hands.

458
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:02,809
Excuse me?

459
00:40:04,539 --> 00:40:07,679
I'll give a sign that shows
you're one of the chosen ones.

460
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:35,469
You will survive if you do as I say.

461
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:38,739
Yes, I will do whatever you say.

462
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,039
You.

463
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:46,420
Now you are my apprentice.

464
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,780
Your apprentice?

465
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:51,719
That means you could be my successor.

466
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,219
You must be so frustrated.

467
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:22,420
They say a stone rolls in
to take out the embedded one.

468
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:25,320
Where did the apprentices
in climbing clothes go?

469
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,260
Where are you going?

470
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,260
To find someone.

471
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:34,329
Why are you sitting there? Come along.

472
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,230
Me?

473
00:41:37,969 --> 00:41:41,099
Are you refusing to listen to
the Shaman's first apprentice?

474
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:44,139
Stand up.

475
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:04,130
Where did they go at a time like this?

476
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:08,099
Maybe they're taking a nap somewhere.

477
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,400
My goodness.

478
00:42:10,469 --> 00:42:12,639
What is all this?

479
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:16,170
Darn it.

480
00:42:17,539 --> 00:42:19,280
Those punks did this.

481
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:22,110
Those punks? Who are you talking about?

482
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,949
Can't you see?

483
00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:29,789
Those jerks
in the intensive care unit did this.

484
00:42:29,849 --> 00:42:32,889
They betrayed the shaman
and killed these guys.

485
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:38,159
Shaman!

486
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,400
Shaman! Shaman! Gosh, Shaman.

487
00:42:47,469 --> 00:42:50,639
Shaman, those jerks betrayed us and...

488
00:42:50,739 --> 00:42:52,210
What do you mean, jerks?

489
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:55,840
Are you being disrespectful
because you want to die?

490
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:57,750
Excuse me?

491
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,050
The higher being is among them.

492
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,349
What? Among those jerks...

493
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,789
I mean, among the people
at the intensive care unit?

494
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:12,260
Then why would he kill your apprentices?

495
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,199
You foolish woman.

496
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:17,769
That's not what's important right now.

497
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:19,599
I'm sorry?

498
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,909
Your mother.

499
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,039
My mother?

500
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:28,610
Shaman, did something
happen to my mother?

501
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,610
That doctor.

502
00:43:32,849 --> 00:43:37,090
Doctor, can I see my mother?

503
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,019
Like I said before,

504
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:42,059
they can't be exposed too much
because they're critical patients.

505
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,429
Don't worry about your mother
and go back.

506
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:47,900
She's really okay, right?

507
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,539
Yes, she's fine.

508
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:57,170
I am the only one you can trust.

509
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,210
Do not trust anyone else.

510
00:44:14,989 --> 00:44:17,690
(Isolated Ward)

511
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:34,840
What is all this?

512
00:45:03,739 --> 00:45:04,840
Mom.

513
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,710
Mom.

514
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:40,610
- Oh, gosh.
- Darn it.

515
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:44,079
- Do you want me to try it?
- It's okay.

516
00:45:57,789 --> 00:45:59,130
Are you scared?

517
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,699
Is there really a monster in here?

518
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:13,980
Do you know
what a monster is most afraid of?

519
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,480
Well... An overpowered item?

520
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:18,079
What?

521
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,250
It means the item is so strong...

522
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:24,489
that it can overpower any monster.

523
00:46:27,019 --> 00:46:29,530
Of course. Should I show you...

524
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:33,829
the item that can beat any monster?

525
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,960
Really? Show me.

526
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:38,800
Sure. Hold on.

527
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:45,769
Ta-da! Isn't this cool?

528
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,110
Here.

529
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:51,880
As long as you have that,
you can beat any monster.

530
00:46:52,349 --> 00:46:54,619
So don't get scared,

531
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,389
and stay strong. Got it?

532
00:46:57,449 --> 00:46:58,449
Yes!

533
00:46:58,889 --> 00:47:00,289
Good for you, Chang Hee!

534
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:15,670
Hwa Seon.

535
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:24,780
Do you really think
we can catch the monster?

536
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:31,590
Why are you asking this?

537
00:47:34,659 --> 00:47:36,929
I honestly don't know...

538
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,099
if we can catch the monster.

539
00:47:42,099 --> 00:47:43,530
Don't be afraid.

540
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,969
That's exactly...

541
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,610
what the monster wants.

542
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:57,510
Dong Rim.

543
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,590
The monster...

544
00:48:11,059 --> 00:48:14,559
could be hiding among us.

545
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:20,900
Then is the music teacher...

546
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:23,869
We don't know for sure.

547
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:29,710
But I will definitely find who it is.

548
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,389
I envy you.

549
00:48:41,989 --> 00:48:42,989
What?

550
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,059
You're strong.

551
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,070
I always gave up and stayed hidden.

552
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,699
Because I don't have courage...

553
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:01,610
I couldn't even ask others for help.

554
00:49:11,219 --> 00:49:13,760
I'm so glad I met you.

555
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:39,210
Where am I?

556
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:43,519
What's this?

557
00:49:46,659 --> 00:49:47,659
You scum.

558
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:51,530
You scum, what did you do to my mom?
What did you do to her?

559
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:53,429
What did you do to her?

560
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:54,960
I have something to ask.

561
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,130
There is something...

562
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,900
in the hospital.

563
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:06,039
Those men who were with you...

564
00:50:06,409 --> 00:50:08,380
died because of that thing.

565
00:50:10,949 --> 00:50:14,380
I think it is in someone's body.

566
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,119
Do you know who it is?

567
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:21,190
You freak, why would you ask me that?

568
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,789
Because you believe
that monster is a deity!

569
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:25,860
What...

570
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:28,699
Get ready to greet a guest.

571
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,070
Who's coming?

572
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,710
You'll see them soon.

573
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:44,409
My goodness, Shaman.

574
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:48,019
Everyone, step back.
They are our guests.

575
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:52,289
No way.

576
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:54,389
You know something, don't you?

577
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:59,190
That's why the shaman said
that woman is a guest.

578
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,730
What do you mean?

579
00:51:03,699 --> 00:51:05,099
Think about it.

580
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:07,969
Since when did the monster appear
in the hospital?

581
00:51:08,869 --> 00:51:11,239
It all started after the woman arrived!

582
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:16,139
You let a woman hosting a monster
into this hospital!

583
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:22,250
Actually, I inhaled the black smoke.

584
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,360
What's wrong?

585
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:39,230
It's nothing.

586
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,409
Why do you think
the shaman let her live?

587
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:51,949
It's because
the master wants her to live!

588
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:55,650
Just like my mom, you'll die soon.

589
00:52:02,659 --> 00:52:05,960
I'll kill you myself, you scum!

590
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:10,199
You piece of trash!

591
00:52:10,269 --> 00:52:13,170
I'll kill you myself!

592
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,670
I'll kill you...

593
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:16,809
myself...

594
00:52:18,809 --> 00:52:19,809
I'll kill you...

595
00:52:38,929 --> 00:52:41,599
Officer Park told me to help you.

596
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:42,659
(Police)

597
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:49,340
- Let's move this together.
- Sure.

598
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:52,210
(IV solution)

599
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,869
I'll go see Ji Hye and Him Chan
for a while.

600
00:53:24,139 --> 00:53:26,039
Did you find Ms. Na?

601
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:30,110
There is a trace of her
moving through the vent.

602
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:34,349
Then did she travel through the vent?

603
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,320
She might have used the emergency exit.

604
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:39,250
I'll check the CCTV footage.

605
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:42,260
Sure. I'll check the emergency exits
with Soon Il.

606
00:53:59,409 --> 00:54:00,409
Soon Il.

607
00:54:01,309 --> 00:54:02,440
What is it?

608
00:54:06,449 --> 00:54:09,179
Hey, switch it off. Gosh.

609
00:54:11,989 --> 00:54:14,360
- Wake up.
- I will.

610
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:17,260
- Let's go.
- Go where now?

611
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,360
To the emergency stairs.

612
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,429
Emergency stairs...

613
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:24,329
Sure. This is an emergency situation.
Let's go.

614
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,730
Let's go.

615
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:27,670
My goodness.

616
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:42,349
I need to check the CCTV footage
from the security room,

617
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:43,889
and I need your help.

618
00:54:52,659 --> 00:54:55,829
Can you come in for a while?
I have something to show you.

619
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,239
(Isolated Ward)

620
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:10,949
I was trying to find a way
to save people.

621
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:12,510
Even though I kept failing.

622
00:55:13,619 --> 00:55:15,619
Detective, you said...

623
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:19,619
that there's something controlling
the black smoke and the infected, right?

624
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:21,519
Yes.

625
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:23,860
You're right.

626
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:28,059
It was controlling us until now.

627
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:35,239
What did you want to show me?

628
00:55:54,019 --> 00:55:55,019
What was that?

629
00:56:00,429 --> 00:56:02,960
What on earth are you doing?

630
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:12,710
Whenever a new virus emerges,

631
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:15,539
how do you think vaccines are made?

632
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:18,880
Did you think we got it
with no sacrifices?

633
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:23,750
What on earth have you been doing?

634
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,019
(Restricted Area)

635
00:56:29,989 --> 00:56:33,699
I wondered why the shaman
suddenly stopped attacking.

636
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,530
The shaman only let the people here live
because of you.

637
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:38,130
To protect you!

638
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:44,809
Are you suspecting me?

639
00:56:49,579 --> 00:56:51,179
Whatever you are,

640
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:54,179
if you really got over the smoke,

641
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:56,320
then you could provide a cure.

642
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,780
How dare you...

643
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,719
(Liquid Nitrogen)

644
00:58:11,559 --> 00:58:13,159
(Liquid Nitrogen)

645
00:58:23,269 --> 00:58:24,940
The monster's weakness.

646
00:58:28,309 --> 00:58:31,480
(Liquid Nitrogen)

647
00:58:38,449 --> 00:58:41,019
(All child actors underwent
psychological therapy while filming.)

648
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:07,719
(Dark Hole)

649
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,650
I think I can find out
the body the monster is hiding in.

650
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:13,550
Do people know that I inhaled the smoke?

651
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:15,219
No, no one knows yet.

652
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:17,559
Why do you care so much about Dong Rim?

653
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:20,960
Don't trust people easily.
You'll be backstabbed by them again.

654
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:24,429
Do not be afraid.
I came to give you a present.

655
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:26,630
They're coming in hordes.
It's out of control!

656
00:59:26,769 --> 00:59:28,670
Don't talk nonsense and stop them.

657
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:30,139
Do Yoon.

658
00:59:30,769 --> 00:59:32,369
Where is Do Yoon?
