Looks like you're never busy,

12
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,890
to be drawing out here.

13
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,359
Are you satisfied to have me expelled?

14
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,269
Why did you do it?

15
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,540
What gave you the right?
Who do you think you are?

16
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,040
- I'm a witness.
- What?

17
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:43,439
I only described what I saw.

18
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,549
What a psycho.

19
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,549
You're out of your senses, aren't you?

Han Dong Rim.

21

22
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,689
Don't act out.

23
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,260
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

24
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:03,730
Sure.

25
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,829
I'd love to see you try.

26
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:08,870
Kill me.

27
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,750
Let's go.

50
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:12,259
- Anyone can come.
- Dad!

51
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,520
- This is the shelter! Hurry!
- If you hear this,

52
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,930
Come to Muji High School.
There's a shelter.

53
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,279
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

54
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,449
Dad, I think I sprained my ankle.

55
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:11,519
- I'll take Eun Sol.
- Dad.

56
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:14,089
- Hyun Mi, you go first. Go on.
- Dad.

57
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:15,449
Hurry and go.

58
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,649
Go! Run!

59
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:46,250
Run!

60
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,350
Go!

61
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,870
That crazy jerk
is trying to kill everyone in here.

62
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:16,680
- Mr. Choi.
- Let go of me.

63
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,250
I have to save the people out there.

64
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,389
Monsters are swarming all over.
Why would you open the door?

65
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:25,060
Sir, people and our students
are out there.

66
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,790
Chairman Choi told me
never to open the door.

67
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:30,459
What?

68
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,430
- Mr. Choi.
- Hyun Mi.

69
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,470
Hyun Mi, Hyun Mi!

70
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,199
No, no, no. Hyun Mi!

71
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,009
Hyun Mi!

72
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,410
Hyun Mi! Hyun Mi! No!

73
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,790
See?

74
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:01,560
Will you still
follow Chairman Choi's order?

75
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:06,000
Would you have done the same
if she were your daughter?

76
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,529
Kid.

77
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:11,459
Kid?

78
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,230
Where are you?

79
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:37,460
Maybe it doesn't affect animals.

80
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,019
Come inside. Hurry.

81
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,460
Are you all right?

82
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,659
Thank you.

83
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,700
Have you seen a child coming in here?

84
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:24,899
It's a little girl.

85
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:27,639
Are you looking for Do Yoon?

86
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:29,509
Do you know her?

87
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,909
Detective.

88
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:47,259
Are you okay, Detective?

89
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,230
If you're hurt, I can take a look at it.

90
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,269
No, I'm fine. I just bumped
into an injured person on the street.

91
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:01,169
Why did you take the girl with you?

92
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,840
I think there is a misunderstanding.

93
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:07,879
I saw Do Yoon on the street
alone in danger.

94
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,379
That's why I took her.

95
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,779
Do you know this girl?

96
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,620
Yes. I work with Do Yoon's mom
at the hospital as a nurse.

97
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,789
So are you a detective?

98
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:28,230
I'm from Seoul. I'm a detective
of the Regional Investigation Unit.

99
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,970
Why did you come
all the way down here from Seoul?

100
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:35,269
I was looking for someone.

101
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,980
I see. Were you tracking down
a criminal by any chance?

102
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:46,279
But where is Do Yoon's mother?

103
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,590
She died.

104
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:02,299
Do Yoon.

105
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,200
It's okay.

106
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,909
You're going to stay here with me.

107
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,350
Sister, could you bring Do Yoon
something to drink?

108
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:18,519
Yes, Disciple.

109
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,919
We have some hot chocolate.
Would you like to have some?

110
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,559
You don't need my permission.

111
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:29,029
Okay.

112
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:36,870
Is it because you're a detective?

113
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,970
How could you say that her mother is dead
right in front of her?

114
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:45,580
Because she needs to be stronger now.

115
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,100
What is this place?

116
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:08,970
Don't be afraid.

117
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,669
This is the place where the New Lord is.

118
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:42,600
Are you all right?

119
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,370
Yes.

120
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,309
What is it?

121
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:52,210
This belongs to one of the sisters.

122
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:55,009
I thought it'd be better
than your bloodstained clothes.

123
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:58,419
Thank you.

124
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:00,750
Are you sure you're okay?

125
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,320
Excuse me?

126
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,860
You haven't been looking very well.

127
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,559
Would you like to drink the water of life?

128
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,899
It will calm your nerves down.

129
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,970
No thanks. I'll be fine.

130
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,970
You know what?

131
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:27,309
You and Do Yoon came here...

132
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,580
because you were
guided here by the New Lord.

133
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:32,419
The New Lord is...

134
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:35,950
punishing the ones without faith.

135
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:38,720
What do you mean?

136
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,330
The New Lord guided you here.

137
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:43,090
So you should have faith in him too.

138
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,669
Are you serious?

139
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,200
Your eyes are full of doubt.

140
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:56,940
You have to banish the doubt
so you can get on the ship of salvation...

141
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:58,139
Listen to me.

142
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,409
You can have faith in whatever you want.

143
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,220
But you have to get it together.

144
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,919
Because that's the only way to survive.

145
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:11,659
What about Do Yoon?

146
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,490
You're free to choose your own destiny.

147
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:19,830
But you don't have the right
to choose what's good for Do Yoon.

148
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:22,529
Do Yoon...

149
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,870
is safer here with me.

150
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:29,039
Think about it.

151
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:31,269
Please help me!

152
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,240
Help me!

153
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,370
Please...

154
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,850
Thank you.

Thank you for your hard work.

160
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,419
Doctor, this should be enough
to block out the black smoke, right?

161
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:04,599
Yes. The door is triple-layered,
so the smoke won't be able to get in.

162
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,130
But I'm not sure about the infected.

163
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,799
But Officer Cho and I are here,
so don't worry too much.

164
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,769
Everyone, please rest assured.

165
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,009
A rescue team will arrive soon.

166
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,470
- Thank goodness!
- We're safe!

00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,980
Officer Park!

169
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:26,420
Officer Park, thank you so much
for your help.

170
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,890
Please have a cup of coffee.

171
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,289
Thank you.

172
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:32,890
Officer Park, you're amazing.

173
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:36,660
You risk your life for the people...

174
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,430
and carry the ball.

175
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,359
Everyone.

176
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,230
All we have to do now...

177
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:46,470
is just trust Officer Park.

178
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:48,970
- Of course!
- We trust you!

179
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,309
Great work today.

180
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,779
He's so reliable.

181
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:58,880
Yes, he is.

182
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,859
The number you've reached
is not available.

183
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:12,430
Can you still not reach her?

184
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,730
No.

185
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm sure the line will be restored soon.
Don't worry so much.

186

(Taehan Towing)

187
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,150
What was that?

188
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,589
(Police)

189
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,279
Hey, open the door!

190
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:41,180
Please open the door!

191
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,349
Hey!

192
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,019
(Muji Hospital)

193
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:49,490
Soon Il. It's me, Tae Han!

194
00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:51,089
Open the door!

195
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,059
There's an emergency patient here!

196
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,730
Open the door quickly!

197
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:57,130
He needs help urgently! What're you doing?

198
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,700
Things are getting interesting.

199
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,130
Doctor!

200
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,470
There's an emergency patient here.
Please open the door!

201
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:05,500
Officer Park,
why aren't you opening the door?

202
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,640
- Okay.
- Wait!

203
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:10,539
We need to prioritize the safety
of the people inside.

204
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:13,279
If he's infected,
all of us will be in danger!

205
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:15,650
I said open the door!

206
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,089
Soon Il! Soon Il!

207
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:35,930
Are you crazy?

208
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,339
- I'm really going to break it!
- Officer Park!

209
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,740
We can't let the smoke get in.
Open the door right now!

210
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,470
I'll do it!

211
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,279
Okay!

212
00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:00,519
- Get him to the emergency room quickly!
- All right!

213
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,630
What were you doing? He almost died!

214
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,400
You lunatic, all of us could've died
because of you!

215
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,569
Please calm down.

216
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,369
It wasn't easy for us to open the door
in these circumstances as well!

217
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:19,740
I'm sorry.

218
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,720
Follow me, you should get treated too.

219
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:27,279
Doctor, what are you doing?

220
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,549
If he's bit by an infected,

221
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:32,059
he's infected as well!

222
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:37,890
You don't get infected
just from being bit.

223
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,460
I'll take responsibility.

224
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,829
Let's go.

225
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,119
You remember me, right?

226
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,029
Yesterday in front of the hospital,

227
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:12,400
you told me to block out the smoke.

228
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,769
Right.

229
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,640
Thanks to you,
the patients and the people here...

230
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,500
were able to survive.

231
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,240
Thank you.

232
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,240
Take a rest.

233
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,839
Your arm.

234
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:28,710
Sorry about that.

235
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,619
Sure.

236
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:58,880
You're free to choose your own destiny.

237
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:02,250
But you don't have the right
to choose what's good for Do Yoon.

238
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,079
Do Yoon...

239
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,180
is safer here with me.

240
00:24:08,589 --> 00:24:09,920
Think about it.

241
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,559
Detective?

242
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,589
Detective, can you hear me?

243
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:23,000
Yes, I can hear you.

244
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,839
Thank goodness. You're safe.

245
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:29,210
Yes. You must be safe too.

246
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:33,240
Did you... Did you save the kid?

247
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,289
Yes, I did,

248
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,289
but I couldn't save the nurse.

249
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,029
I also...

250
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,259
couldn't save my friend.

251
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:54,900
Don't blame yourself.

252
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,130
It's not your fault.

253
00:24:58,299 --> 00:24:59,299
Where are you?

254
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,710
I'm taking shelter somewhere safe for now.

255
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:04,140
Where are you?

256
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,380
I'm at Muji Hospital.

257
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,210
Are there any survivors there?

258
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,549
Fortunately, yes.

259
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,519
I see.

260
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:16,349
I think I should get to the school.

261
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,049
They have a shelter.

262
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,960
I'll contact you again.

263
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:27,329
Please be careful.

264
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:34,640
I'm giving you an antibiotic
and a tetanus shot.

265
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:37,039
Okay.

266

(Nurse Yoon Saet Byeol)

267
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,720
- Yoon Saet Byeol.
- From the town?

268
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:50,950
- From Seoul.
- Age?

269
00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:52,119
22.

270
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,390
Occupation.

271
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:57,059
What is this, are you interrogating me?

272
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:00,099
- So she is a shady woman.
- I'm telling you, she's not!

273
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,329
She's an angel!

274
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,500
Do you...

275
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,940
happen to know Nam Young Sik?

276
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:14,579
What? You know Young Sik too?

277
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,420
Yes, we're friends.

278
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:25,089
I hope he didn't tell you
anything weird about me.

279
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,019
Not really.

280
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:30,829
He said you're like an angel.

281
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,230
He'll be safe too, won't he?

282
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:50,579
Yes,

283
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:53,519
since he's talented in many ways.

284
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:59,660
Right? I'm sure he's hiding
somewhere safe.

285
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,759
Unlike how he looks,
he's very quick-witted.

286
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,130
By the way,

287
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:11,869
were you on the radio with a detective?

288
00:27:15,609 --> 00:27:16,609
Yes.

289
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:19,910
Then will all of us be rescued?

290
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:24,609
I'm not sure.

291
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:27,920
I see.

292
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:32,259
I hope things go back to normal again.

293
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,599

- I can't.
- Will you just get up?

296
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:30,210
Get up. Come on.

297

Newbie. Repeat after me. Sparrows.

00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,700
Sparrows.

Yoo Tae Han.

301
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,599
All I want to tell you...

302
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,269
is to never become like this guy.

303
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:55,170
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

304
00:28:56,509 --> 00:28:58,440
You're so out of it. Stand straight.

305
00:28:58,509 --> 00:29:00,410
Why is this place...

306
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,579
- so messy?
- How dare you?

307
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,210
Get this! You punk.

308
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:06,920
Go on your way. We're just wrestling.

309
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,220
You punk. You punk!

310
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,289
I saw you.

311
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:20,430
Sorry?

312
00:29:20,829 --> 00:29:22,200
Where's that woman?

313
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:24,329
That woman?

314
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,769
That woman inhaled black smoke too.

315
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:37,680
Don't be so anxious.

316
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,450
You'll find out soon.

317
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:05,240
Mr. Kim, we can't use
the broadcasting room now, right?

318
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,779
No, we can't.
Chairman Choi smashed everything.

319
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,480
But didn't we keep the emergency
communication equipment there?

320
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,049
We did,

321
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,019
but it's for the best.

322
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,920
If people barge in
after hearing the broadcast,

323
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,490
we'll be out of food.

324
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,990
The ones here must survive,
don't you think?

325
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:26,059
- I'll go and get more tape.
- Oh, okay.

326
00:30:29,069 --> 00:30:33,140
Stack them up tightly
so that the infected can't come in!

327
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,309
Do it properly!

328
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,480
What are you doing? Hurry up!

329
00:30:40,609 --> 00:30:41,609
Darn it.

330
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,420
What are you, dumb?
You can't even do this?

331
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,619
Hey, is it good? Let me have it.

332
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,019
You can't even hammer a nail?

333
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:53,289
- It really hurts!
- Gosh, you!

334
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:54,359
You idiot!

335
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,089
- Come here, punk.
- What?

336
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,099
Are you here to have fun?

337
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:04,029
No.

338
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,369
They're still young.

339
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,869
They're not used to hammering.

340
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,039
Listen.

341
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:14,640
Do you think the infected won't kill kids?

342
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,250
Hello, Chairman Choi.

343
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:23,690
Do your job properly.

344
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,589
One man's mistake
can get all of us killed.

345
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,390
Got it?

346
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,430
And Mr. Seo, make sure...

347
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,970
to check their work and report to me.

348
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:38,329
Yes, sir.

349
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:43,170
How are we to overcome a crisis
with this lax mindset?

350
00:31:54,849 --> 00:31:58,049
Kids these days are so thoughtless.

351
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:00,420
All they do is waste taxes.

352
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:05,130
Have you checked up on the gas masks?

353
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,160
Yes, we have some from last year
that we used for disaster training.

354
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,069
What about the fuel
for the emergency generator?

355
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:13,039
I think it'll last a month
if we conserve it.

356
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:14,240
What about rations?

357
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:18,410
I checked the food
we have in the cafeteria,

358
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,609
and we have enough to last a week.

359
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,680
A week?

360
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:27,049
Yes, for the students,
staff, and the local residents.

361
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:29,619
- Feed them one meal a day from today.
- One meal?

362
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,890
Are you here to have fun?

363
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,859
This is an emergency!

364
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,759
We don't know how long this will go on.

365
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,000
And you want to feed everyone
three meals a day?

366
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:40,559
Do you want all of us to die?

367
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,329
I apologize. I was thoughtless.

368
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:49,539
You remember what we have to do
in case of an emergency, don't you?

369
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:51,240
Yes, sir. I do.

370
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,950
I'll get going.

371
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,680
(The New Lord is waiting for you.)

372
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,980
Detective, you must be hungry.

373
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,920
Have a meal with us.

374
00:33:55,509 --> 00:33:58,539
Do Yoon, come and eat with me.

375
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:11,090
(Repent, the New Paradise is at hand.)

376
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:21,699
Okay. Let's say grace.

377
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:32,639
New Lord, we thank you
for the food you’ve given us...

378
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,409
during hardship.

379
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,980
We believe you will save us from the end
and guide us to the New Paradise.

380
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,019
- We believe.
- Yes, my lord.

381
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:44,750
Let us achieve our purpose
with our faith in you.

382
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,820
- Let us achieve!
- Let us achieve!

383
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:49,829
- Lord, save us.
- Yes, with our faith in you.

384
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:52,800
- Let us achieve.
- Let us achieve.

385
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:57,329
Now, let's enjoy the meal.

386
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,110
Here.

387
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:15,050
What's wrong?

388
00:35:15,889 --> 00:35:18,050
Do you not like it
because it's instant food?

389
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,960
No.

390
00:35:20,389 --> 00:35:23,159
I think I have to leave now.

391
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,429
Let's go, Kid.

392
00:35:26,329 --> 00:35:28,000
She needs to eat something first.

393
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:30,030
Don't you think so?

394
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,369
Go ahead and have some.

395
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,889
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

396
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:54,519
- Do Yoon.
- Oh, gosh.

397
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,590
- Gosh, what's wrong?
- My goodness.

398
00:35:56,659 --> 00:35:59,130
My goodness, Do Yoon. What's wrong?

399
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,960
- Do Yoon?
- Do Yoon.

400
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:05,170
- Do Yoon.
- What's wrong with her?

401
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,469
Gosh, what do we do?

402
00:36:08,909 --> 00:36:11,610
Do Yoon. Do Yoon, hang in there.

403
00:36:11,739 --> 00:36:13,409
- Can you hold her?
- Okay.

404
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,679
- Gosh.
- Do Yoon, open your eyes.

405
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,719
Can you see me?

406
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:22,719
Wait a minute.

407
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:25,889
Does this part hurt?

408
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:29,260
(Anaphylaxis)

409
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,929
We need to keep her warm.
Bring me some blankets.

410
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,530
- All right.
- Do Yoon.

411
00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:39,769
Wake up. Do Yoon, can you hear me?

412
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,780
She'll be all right.

413
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,050
What was wrong with her?

414
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,920
She has an allergic reaction,
called anaphylaxis.

415
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:03,059
How do you treat her?

416
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:05,760
She needs an epinephrine injection.

417
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,599
What?

418
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,829
I mean she needs an adrenaline injection.

419
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,400
Don't worry about her.

420
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:17,409
I believe the New Lord
will protect Do Yoon.

421
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:23,210
Thou shall be healed.

422
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,010
- Shall be healed.
- Shall be healed.

423
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:30,619
Would you like to drink the water of life
so you can heal faster?

424
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,360
Come with me.

425
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:45,670
I know what you're thinking.

426
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,739
That's what will trouble Do Yoon.

427
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:52,880
Do Yoon will be safer
if she stays with us.

428
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,380
Are you sure...

429
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,320
you can protect Do Yoon to the end?

430
00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:21,139
Are you going somewhere?

431
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,309
How is she?

432
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:25,570
She's okay.

433
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:28,880
Disciple Kim is taking good care of her.

434
00:38:28,909 --> 00:38:30,110
So don't worry.

435
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,420
You haven't been eating anything.

436
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:37,150
Drink some water at least.

437
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:46,130
I understand
why we seem so strange to you.

438
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,199
But we're not bad people...

439
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,130
like criminals.

440
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:54,000
If there's a misunderstanding,
I wish to clear it up.

441
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,889
I heard a broadcast before I got here.

442
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:14,960
The one from the school?

443
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:18,190
When the kid gets better,

444
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,559
I want to take her there.

445
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:24,030
Do you really believe them?

446
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:27,099
In times of disaster,

447
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:29,610
school facilities are used as shelters.

448
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,510
You are foolish.

449
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:37,210
Going there won't make
the fear that's bothering you disappear.

450
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:38,909
No.

451
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:43,019
Your people are the ones
who are shaking with fear.

452
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:46,659
The ones who blindly follow a deity.

453
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:53,159
All right. You don't have faith.

454
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,829
You should leave.

455
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:58,269
But we can't let you
take Do Yoon with you.

456
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:01,539
Do Yoon will stay with us...

457
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,139
and get on the ship of salvation
for the New Paradise.

458
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:07,909
That's what's best for Do Yoon.

459
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:25,900
Don't worry.

460
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,860
Disciple Kim put some...

461
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,829
tranquilizer in your drink.

462
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,369
Oh, hello.

463
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,409
I'm sorry about what I said earlier.

464
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:14,039
No, don't say that. You were right.

465
00:41:14,409 --> 00:41:18,210
The girl who died
is the same age as my daughter.

466
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:21,079
I just didn't want to get in trouble.

467
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,690
But I shouldn't have done that.

468
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,190
So will you forgive me
for what I've said earlier?

469
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,960
There's nothing to forgive.

470
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:32,360
You're going through more trouble
than anyone else.

471
00:41:32,429 --> 00:41:34,699
It's not true. You're the one
who's going through trouble.

472
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,670
Oh, no. You don't have to say that.

473
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,199
I'm just doing my job.

474
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:06,900
Now I'm so scared
that I can't even go to the toilet.

475
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,599
But we're lucky
we don't have to take KSAT.

476
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,170
Since when did you worry about KSAT?
My goodness.

477
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:16,739
- Are you crazy?
- What?

478
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:19,380
If I settle down to study,

479
00:42:19,409 --> 00:42:20,840
I can go to a four-year-course college.

480
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,110
Hey.

481
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,079
My cell phone still doesn't work.

482
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,349
Are you sure Korea
is an IT developed country?

483
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:34,159
Hey, maybe the whole country
is in a disastrous situation.

484
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:37,889
What on earth are you talking about?

485
00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:40,659
- Just go get some sleep.
- Gosh.

486
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,969
Who's that?

487
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:46,440
Hey, little brats, keep it down.

488
00:43:36,949 --> 00:43:38,820
If you say a word about...

489
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:42,519
what happened to the others
in the mountain, I won't let you off.

490
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:43,889
Understood?

491
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:46,360
What are you so afraid of?

492
00:43:48,699 --> 00:43:49,699
What?

493
00:43:49,969 --> 00:43:54,099
Oh, the fact that you let your friend die
just so you could live?

494
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,800
Isn't that it?

495
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:58,739
Stop blabbering, you don't know a thing.

496
00:43:58,809 --> 00:44:00,210
Don't act tough.

497
00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:03,510
I can see clearly how terrified you are.

498
00:45:08,179 --> 00:45:09,780
You will turn into one as well.

499
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:11,510
A monster like them.

500
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,059
Shut it.

501
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:22,829
Not me.

502
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,659
Not me.

503
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:39,269
Everyone. For us to ascend to the sky,

504
00:45:40,179 --> 00:45:44,510
we need to leave all our sins behind
on the earth.

505
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:46,010
- Yes.
- My Lord.

506
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,590
Then we can be freed from our sins.

507
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:50,920
It will come true.

508
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:55,119
Now, to do that, what should we do?

509
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,900
- Confess our sins to the Lord!
- Confess our sins to the Lord!

510
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,059
That's right!

511
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,699
We need to empty ourselves of the sins!

512
00:46:06,769 --> 00:46:07,940
- Yes.
- We will.

513
00:46:17,949 --> 00:46:21,920
With that, we can board
the ship of salvation with New Lord...

514
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:26,090
and enter the new paradise!

515
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:28,090
- New paradise!
- New paradise!

516
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:29,760
- In the New Lord we trust!
- I believe in you!

517
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:30,889
It will come true!

518
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:32,900
- It will come true!
- It will come true!

519
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,960
- It will come true!
- It will come true!

520
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:36,429
We believe!

521
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:38,300
It will come true!

522
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,269
- It will come true!
- It will come true!

523
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,170
I believe! Please save me.

524
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:47,039
I believe, I believe!

525
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:48,739
It will come true!

526
00:47:07,329 --> 00:47:08,329
Here.

527
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,940
Think about all your sins
that need to be cleansed.

528
00:47:18,409 --> 00:47:22,780
(With evangelism, you will reach paradise.
Prayer Revival Meeting)

529
00:47:31,219 --> 00:47:34,090
Now the moment of salvation...

530
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,860
to go to the new paradise is here!

531
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:16,400
It's all right.

532
00:48:23,969 --> 00:48:24,969
Stop!

533
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,030
That child.

534
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,159
Send her over here.

535
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,199
Do you still not get it?

536
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:53,539
There's nothing you can do for this child.

537
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,440
Just leave her so Do Yoon can be saved.

538
00:48:56,469 --> 00:48:57,809
Stop talking gibberish.

539
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:00,280
This isn't salvation, this is murder!

540
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:05,079
Shut it, you evil!

541
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:10,320
Do Yoon, drink up.

542
00:49:16,659 --> 00:49:18,059
This is my last warning.

543
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:19,730
Detective.

544
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:23,829
Do you still not get it?

545
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:26,969
The world is coming to its end.

546
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,170
Before it's too late,

547
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:31,409
let's board the ship of salvation with us.

548
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,010
Stop with your nonsense!

549
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:37,579
Then shall we let her decide?

550
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:41,050
Let's ask if she really wants
to stay with you...

551
00:49:41,449 --> 00:49:43,920
in this world that's ending.

552
00:49:45,289 --> 00:49:47,420
Do Yoon, do you...

553
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:50,389
really not want to see your mom?

554
00:49:50,989 --> 00:49:51,989
Mom.

555
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,199
I miss her.

556
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:57,829
Then would you like to go with us,

557
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:00,800
or stay with that lady?

558
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:04,840
Kid.

559
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:06,880
Come to me.

560
00:50:07,539 --> 00:50:09,309
Your mom told me to protect you.

561
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:12,650
Please let me keep that promise.

562
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:16,179
Do Yoon. Hurry up.

563
00:50:30,469 --> 00:50:31,530
Do Yoon.

564
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:35,099
Come to me.

565
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:15,579
How dare you get in the way
of the New Lord's plan?

566
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:17,280
Run away, now!

567
00:52:54,739 --> 00:52:57,679
4 times 4 is 16. 4 times 5 is 20.

568
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:02,780
4 times 6 is 24. 4 times 7 is 28.

569
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,750
- Kid.
- 4 times 8 is 3...

570
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:06,389
Where are you?

571
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:16,329
My mom...

572
00:53:16,969 --> 00:53:20,469
always found me wherever I hid.

573
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,869
There you are!

574
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:27,280
Did you think I wouldn't find you
if you hid here?

575
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,949
Mom, how did you know I was here?

576
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:31,610
I found you with your smell.

577
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:34,920
It's not a bad smell.
It's a really nice smell.

578
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,789
Do Yoon! Jung Do Yoon!

579
00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:43,119
Mom!

580
00:53:43,789 --> 00:53:47,059
Do Yoon! Are you all right? Are you hurt?

581
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:48,599
I'm fine.

582
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,269
My baby.

583
00:53:52,369 --> 00:53:56,670
She said she could find me
because I have a nice smell.

584
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:05,750
It's okay now.

585
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,730
My mom trusted you.

586
00:54:18,289 --> 00:54:20,300
So I trust you too.

587
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:32,769
We need to get out of here.

588
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,440
Let's go.

589
00:54:59,699 --> 00:55:00,769
(Emergency equipment)

590
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:35,369
Please forgive my sins.

591
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,440
Please forgive me for what I have sinned!

592
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:52,289
Go away. I said, go away.

593
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:55,519
You evil!

594
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:58,559
Go away! Step back!

595
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:02,199
I command in the name of the New Lord!

596
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,000
Go away!

597
00:56:04,829 --> 00:56:07,269
Go away!

598
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:10,869
(Muji Hospital)

599
00:56:21,019 --> 00:56:22,179
Excuse me.

600
00:56:25,449 --> 00:56:26,690
What now?

601
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:30,590
You got bitten by an infected, didn't you?

602
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:31,829
A variant?

603
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:34,829
That's what we call people
whose eyes turned black.

604
00:56:34,929 --> 00:56:37,300
Don't change the topic.
Roll up your sleeve.

605
00:56:37,369 --> 00:56:38,500
Why should I?

606
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:40,699
I was right.

607
00:56:40,769 --> 00:56:42,570
Officer Cho, handcuff him right now.

608
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:48,980
- Soon Il, this is enough.
- What are you doing?

609
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:51,809
You're abusing your authority.
Don't you know that?

610
00:56:52,449 --> 00:56:54,150
I'm not abusing my authority.

611
00:56:54,219 --> 00:56:56,889
It's my job to protect the citizens.

612
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:58,219
Let me go.

613
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,019
Doctor, you need to see this.

614
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:05,489
- What happened?
- There's a survivor.

615
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:07,699
What? Where?

616
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,400
The lab on the fifth floor.

617
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:17,409
There's a survivor?

618
00:57:21,309 --> 00:57:23,280
Look at that. It's there.

619
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:26,579
The surgical ward was shut down.

620
00:57:30,519 --> 00:57:32,590
(Help! There are survivors here!)

621
00:57:32,619 --> 00:57:33,889
Wait a minute.

622
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:42,360
Isn't that your wife?

623
00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:50,039
Baby, Daddy is off to work.
I'll be back soon.

624

Have a good day!

That's my wife.

for his special appearance.)

Don't lie!

You know no one is coming to save us.

634
01:01:09,269 --> 01:01:10,869
What do you think you're doing?

635
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:13,510
We can't have everyone here infected!

636
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:15,909
The pregnant woman is in bad condition.

637
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:19,010
Sacrifice is needed to save everyone else!

638
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:21,849
Would you have said that
if they were your family?

639
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:22,949
Hwa Seon!

640
01:01:23,019 --> 01:01:24,590
They're controlled by someone.

641
01:01:24,619 --> 01:01:26,849
Please open the door.

642
