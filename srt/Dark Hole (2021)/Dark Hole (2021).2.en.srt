Let's reduce it to five
starting from next year.

20
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,319
Sorry?

21
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,590
I'm saying, we lack exclusivity.

22
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:42,430
If anyone can get it,

23
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,759
how is that a scholarship?

24
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,659
Of course.

25
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:50,599
It must be special for
the recipient to be grateful.

26
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:53,810
Chairman,

27
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,569
let me brief you on the procedure
of the scholarship awarding ceremony.

28
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,139
That's okay.

29
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:03,949
We do the same thing every year.
I memorized everything.

30
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,389
You are indeed amazing, Mr. Chairman.

31
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,159
If there's nothing else to share,
you can leave, Mr. Choi.

32
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:15,659
There's one more thing
I'd like to share with you.

33
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,660
Mr. Choi.

34
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,000
You can discuss that with me later.

35
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,740
What is it?

36
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:26,170
Well...

37
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,540
It's regarding the school janitors
I mentioned before.

38
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,480
Mr. Choi.

39
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:36,980
You should only focus
on teaching the kids!

40
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:39,579
I'll manage the school affairs.

41
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:41,449
Do you understand?

42
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,519
Yes, sir.

43
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:47,959
Mr. Choi. You may leave.

44
00:04:57,269 --> 00:04:59,040
No wonder.

45
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:02,839
He's so weak-hearted.

46
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,139
My gosh.

47
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,160
Oh, gosh. This is unbelievable.

48
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,959
Officer Park, this is a sinkhole, right?

49
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,930
It's big enough to be recorded
in the Guinness Book of Records.

50
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,170
That's nonsense.

51

- Oh, gosh!
- Goodness! What was that?

54
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,009
What? What?

55
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,579
You just pushed me! Be honest!

56
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,889
Why would I push you?

57
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,259
Darn it. I can't see the bottom.

58
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,490
This land belongs to the chairman.

59
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:55,589
It might all end up becoming worthless.

60
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:57,959
The chairman?

61
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:00,399
You don't need to know.

62
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,370
Gosh, it must be in the car being charged.

63
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,769
Will you stop taking pictures?

64
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:15,209
Hey, put up a police line
so no one can get in.

65
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:16,509
What?

66
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,920
By myself?

67
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,319
Just do as I say. Got it?

68
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:23,959
Yes, sir.

71
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,300
Chairman Choi, this is Park Soon Il. Yes.

72
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,300
We have a little problem here.

73
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:43,170
The land for the nursing home
you're going to build.

74
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,379
We found a hole in the land.

75
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:48,449
A hole? What kind of hole?

76
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,980
Well, it's...

77
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:53,720
kind of a big hole.

78
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,550
What are you talking about?

79
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,290
How can a hole suddenly
appear in the mountain?

80
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,629
Well, I think it's a sinkhole.

81
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,399
A sinkhole?

82
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,430
Do you know
how much money is at stake there?

83
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,540
I don't care how much soil you need.
Just gather some people...

84
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,240
and fill the hole by today.

85
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:17,009
If you don't want to be fired,
get it done.

86
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,209
Yes, Chairman Choi. I'll get it done.

87
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,319
Gosh. This is crazy.

88
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,730
How am I supposed to fill a hole this big?

89
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:38,959
Hey, this is upside down. Put it up again!

90
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,819
Who are you?

91
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:12,329
Who on earth are you?

92
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,139
You seem all right.

93
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:30,980
Why does an officer keep
pointing her gun at me?

94
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,720
Don't you remember?

95
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:39,919
You tried to kill me at the mountain.

96
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,399
Good.

97
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:00,509
Are you sure you're okay?

98
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,320
Wait.

99
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,490
What did you see in the hole?

100
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:18,429
Well?

101
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:21,970
My friend's eyes changed black too,
and he acted strangely.

102
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,570
You must know something about it.

103
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,169
- Sung Beom.
- Don't do this.

104
00:09:29,909 --> 00:09:31,009
This isn't like you.

105
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,220
Yes.

106
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,419
Hwa Seon, I got the security footage...

107
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,730
of Lee Soo Yeon’s car
recorded a month ago.

108
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,700
It was in front of Jingan Tunnel
in Muji City.

109
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,629
I'll send you the footage right now.

110
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,899
Jingan Tunnel?

111
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,500
Thank you.

112
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,299
I'm sorry but I didn't see anything.

113
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,610
Excuse me.

114
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:03,539
Well, wait.

115
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:25,500
It takes three hours
to Jingan Tunnel by foot.

116
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,980
Get in.

117
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,149
- Hello.
- Hello.

118
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:47,850
- Hello.
- Hello.

119
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,750
Don't run.

120
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,090
Sir, what are you doing?

121
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,129
They were saying
the door wouldn't lock so I checked.

122
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,529
And it seems I have to change the latch.

123
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,129
I see. Do you have to
change the whole thing?

124
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,440
Yes, I think I should. It's broken.

125
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:05,899
So I should change it.

126
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:07,639
Dong Rim.

127
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,980
What happened to you?

128
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,009
It's nothing.

129
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,649
What do you mean it's nothing?

130
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,120
You should go to the nurse's office.

131
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,450
I'll go later.

132
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:25,789
You're attending my class this period
so go to the nurse's office now.

133
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,360
That's the bell, guys.

134
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,740
Do you know the phone number?

135
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,909
What phone number?

136
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,210
The phone number of a counseling center
or a welfare center.

137
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,419
(A helping hand for adolescents,
Call 1388 anytime)

138
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,120
There's no use
in enduring everything by yourself.

139
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,159
And no one can help you
unless you talk first.

Sir.

142

Sir.

143
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,190
How is his condition?

144
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,019
He suddenly vomited
then he started convulsing.

145
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:33,960
Sir, can you hear my voice?

146
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,830
Move him inside.

147
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,700
Oh, gosh.

148
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:49,840
Yes, that's right. Yes.

149
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,840
It's Chairman Choi's orders.

150
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,509
I have to fill the hole by today.

151
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,580
How many times do I have to tell you?

152
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,179
Every piece of equipment
is taken out to the site.

153
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,850
Hey, can't you understand the situation?

154
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,350
If you fall out of favor with the old man,

155
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:03,750
do you think
you can keep the business going?

156
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:05,019
So we have to fill the hole by today.

157
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,629
If we can't, we'll both be in trouble.

158
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,200
All right, all right.
I'll bring the equipment from the site.

159
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:13,399
What? Okay, okay.

160
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,799
Hey, you have to be very discreet.
Do you understand?

161
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,440
This little jerk.
I was going to hang up first.

162
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:35,620
Shall I give you what you want?

163
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,519
Do you want it?

164
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,289
Tell me.

165
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,629
Do you want it?

166
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,230
Come.

00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,899
Come to me.

00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:31,139
The ones who do not accept me will die.

169
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:35,580
The ones who do not accept me will die.

170
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:39,450
The ones who do not accept me will die.

171
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:42,850
The ones who do not accept me will die.

172
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,419
The ones who do not accept me will die.

173
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,690
The ones who do not accept me will die.

174
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,509
The ones who do not accept me...

175
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,649
will die.

176
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:21,289
What?

177
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,159
- My brother.
- Gosh, what?

178
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,299
You startled me.

179
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,970
The New Lord loves you.

180
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,840
(Repent. The new paradise is near.
Welcome the New Lord.)

181
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,740
Mister, I'm busy right now.

182
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,450
So get lost.

183
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,049
The New Lord will start
giving revelations soon.

184
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:47,350
It's not too late for you so...

185
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:50,220
What are you talking about,
you cult freak? Darn it.

186
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,230
Han Dong Rim!

187
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,429
Hey, hey.

188
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,500
I've been waiting for a while.

189
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:02,799
We need to talk.

190
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,799
It's not about our business.

191
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:08,639
I just want to talk human-to-human.

192
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,580
You recorded an interesting video.

193
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,850
Where are you looking at?

194
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,450
- Lift your head up, Dong Rim.
- Lift up your head.

195
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,820
Is this funny? Hey.

196
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,330
Your grandma shouldn't watch this, right?

197
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,629
What do you want from me?

198
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,559
Don't be so touchy.

199
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:36,330
I just want to show you something fun.

200
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,470
Hop on first.

201
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,970
Whenever I come to this school,
it reminds me of when I was expelled,

202
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,769
so it feels like dirt.

203
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,809
Let's go.

204
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:48,779
Hurry up!

205
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,879
- Walk faster!
- Look.

206
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,389
Why would you say that?

207
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,590
Hey.

208
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,159
Where are we going?

209
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,830
Have you guys heard of a sinkhole?

210
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:06,829
Oh, like a big hole in the ground!

211
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,630
Is that the best you can explain it?

212
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,599
- A hole is a hole!
- You dimwits.

213
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,269
Is that funny?

214
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:16,240
But what about it?

215
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,880
Well, there's one here.

216
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,079
Amazing! Really?

217
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,349
Darn it.

218
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,180
So we came all the way here
just to see a hole in the ground?

219
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:28,619
What, don't you want to?

220
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,890
Then go get a part-time job
and fry some chickens or something.

221
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,960
Why would you suddenly say that?

222
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:39,029
You know I don't like chickens.

223
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,329
Let's go.

224
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,000
Come on.

225
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,539
Hey.

226
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,880
Is this funny? What are you staring at?

227
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,829
Doesn't it look like
there's something in there?

228
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:12,900
- Hey!
- Gosh!

229
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:18,470
- Did you get scared?
- Not at all!

230
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:22,809
- My gosh.
- Let's check what's in there.

231
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:31,420
- Dong Rim.
- Dong Rim!

232
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,819
What?

233
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,549
What are you doing?

234
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,319
Their phones are all new.

235
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,619
Let's use yours.

236
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:45,400
(It's so fascinating
to see the inside of a sinkhole!)

237
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,829
(What if something suddenly pops up?)

238
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,430
It's so deep.

239
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,400
Man, there's nothing inside.

240
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,940
It's no big deal.

241
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,210
How deep is this thing?

242
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:02,450
What's wrong with this?

243
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,849
Hey. Do it properly, will you?

244
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,890
What? I didn't do anything!

245
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,049
Nothing's showing on the screen, idiot!

246
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,059
I'm just holding the line.

247
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:16,759
What was that?
I think someone pulled the line.

248
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:19,799
Hold it tight. Pull it.

249
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:22,599
Darn it.

250
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,400
What's wrong with this?

251
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,410
- Gosh.
- What was that just now?

252
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,440
I think someone really pulled it.

253
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:35,309
Who on earth would pull it?

254
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,750
Do you think there's a monster down there
or something?

255
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:40,319
What a coward.

256
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:42,819
- Gosh.
- Darn it.

257
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:50,730
Sorry about your phone, breadwinner.

258
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,630
What's there for you to be sorry about?

259
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,529
It's her phone's fault.

260
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,470
Why did it have to fall like that?

261
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,799
Hey. Go and get it yourself.

262
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,609
- Let me go.
- Are you ignoring us?

263
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,210
- Let me go.
- Come here.

264
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:10,049
- Let me go!
- Go get it yourself.

265
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:11,480
Let go of me!

266
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,319
Are you all right?

267
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,089
Do you have a death wish?

268
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:24,630
Hey. Grab her properly.

269
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,329
She's so strong for her size.

270
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,200
You'll only come to your senses
after you've broken a bone or two, right?

271
00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:32,140
Do you want to die?

272
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,740
Are you crazy? I'm talking to you!

273
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,210
What're you looking at?

274
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:53,720
- What is this?
- What's this?

275
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,299
Hey, are you all right?

276
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:03,730
What's wrong?

277
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,410
Stop!

278
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:11,309
I'll kill you. I'll kill you all!

279
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,740
Don't touch me!

280
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:18,150
A scum like you should die!

281
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:20,480
Die, die!

282
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,519
Die!

283
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:25,920
Hey!

284
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:28,029
Die! Die!

285
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,759
Die. I'll kill you.

286
00:21:31,829 --> 00:21:32,829
Die.

287
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:39,470
Mom.

288
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,940
Don't leave.

289
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,009
Mom.

290
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:07,329
What...

291
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:10,460
Hurry up and push!

292
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,869
Harder!

293
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,670
Hurry up!

294
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,299
What am I doing
in the middle of the night?

295
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,799
Where are you?

296
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:23,730
There's not much time left,
so get there as soon as possible.

297
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,710
Soon Il, it's too dark to see anything.

298
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:31,410
Are you going to take responsibility
if I get in an accident like this?

299
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,940
Take responsibility, my foot.

300
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,809
If I get fired, you'll get fired too.
Don't you know that?

301
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,049
That won't do.

302
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,450
Whatever. Let's go!

303
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:49,630
(Tunnel Ahead)

304
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,220
The clip is from a month ago.

305
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,920
The car belongs to a woman in her 20s.

306
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:16,819
She's still missing.

307
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:19,819
The car enters the tunnel,
but it doesn't come out.

308
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,130
I think it went out through a door
in the middle of the tunnel.

309
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:04,299
Hwa Seon.

310
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:15,609
Lee Soo Yeon!

311
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,710
It's this way.

312
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,019
I'm over here.

313
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:34,559
Hwa Seon.

314
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,279
Black eyes.

315
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,240
Sung Beom.

316
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,079
No.

317
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,180
Please wake up.

318
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,279
You're going into that hole again.

319
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,220
Get out of there.

320
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:32,190
You can't go in too deep.

321
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,069
There's no Wi-Fi here.

322
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,210
I can't look up
why your eyes turned black.

323
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:03,250
Did you eat something weird
in the mountain?

324
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,990
My friend's eyes turned black like yours.

325
00:29:09,819 --> 00:29:13,220
My eyes turned black?

326
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,460
Yes.

327
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,460
They're fine now.

328
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:22,400
This is frustrating.
It's not like I can show you.

329
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:29,210
I don't understand why,

330
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:31,210
but I see things out of the blue.

331
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:33,579
You see things?

332
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:37,779
Young Sik also...

333
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:39,519
Tae Han. My father's here!

334
00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:41,819
Your father passed away long ago.
Get a grip!

335
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,519
It's my father!

336
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:44,619
Nurse!

337
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,119
He said he saw his dead father.

338
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:54,759
What did you see?

339
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,769
Lee Soo Yeon.

340
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,769
I saw the serial killer
who killed my husband.

341
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:05,380
Just like the day she killed my husband,

342
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,809
she put a white cloth over his head...

343
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:12,119
and injected him in the neck.

344
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,079
Then what happened?

345
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:18,420
Did you catch that person?

346
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:20,589
No.

347
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,259
I came to Muji to catch her.

348
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:28,000
Ever since I fainted...

349
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,170
after seeing that great sinkhole
in the mountains,

350
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:35,640
I think I started seeing things.

351
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,440
Why did you kill him?

352
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,450
Why did you kill him?

353
00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:48,849
Let's go see a doctor first.

354
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:52,190
It's on the way into town.

355
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:53,619
I mean the hospital.

356
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,569
- Oh, dear.
- Be careful!

357
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,069
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

358
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,769
- My goodness.
- Seriously.

359
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,869
- What's going on?
- You brat!

360
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,240
You punk! You put out
a whole row of lights!

361
00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:14,410
I told you it's dangerous
to work at night!

362
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,650
How dare you?

363
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:16,710
My gosh!

364
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,829
What's going on?

365
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,259
My goodness.

366
00:31:31,329 --> 00:31:33,700
You punks! Is this the best you can do?

367
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:35,900
Didn't I tell you it's dangerous at night?

368
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,670
- You punk!
- How dare you glare at me?

369
00:31:38,769 --> 00:31:40,240
- Come here!
- Don't do it.

370
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:42,569
- Move!
- I'll handle it.

371
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,509
- Please, don't.
- I won't put you down!

372
00:31:44,609 --> 00:31:47,240
- You brat.
- Come at me. I'll take you on.

373
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,519
What was that?

374
00:31:57,019 --> 00:31:58,819
Sir! My gosh.

375
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,690
- Sir!
- Sir!

376
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:02,630
Sir! Please help me!

377
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,059
There's nothing wrong here.

378
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,500
Excuse me, sir.

379
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,799
What are you doing? Are you kidding me?

380
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,029
I'm sorry. We're figuring out
what the problem is.

381
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:13,569
- So please wait a little more.
- Wait?

382
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,440
What on earth?

383
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:19,880
Is there a fire?

384
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,180
- My goodness.
- What is this?

385
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:33,660
(Safety warning: Dong-gu,
Blackout caused by utility pole)

386
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,329
Dong-gu?

387
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,859
My mom's hospital is in Dong-gu.

388
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,569
Why is there a blackout?

389
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:45,369
Did it really blow up?

390
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,369
What are you talking about?

391
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,069
Don't you watch the news?

392
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,440
The sun even exploded.

393
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,180
- Isn't that Dong Rim?
- Who? Dong Rim?

394
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,069
I'm sorry, sir.

395
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:25,210
Yes. Of course.

396
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:27,279
I'll sort it out quickly.

397
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,680
Sure.

398
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:38,650
Hey! Will you hurry up?

399
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:42,259
You don't dare talk back to an old man.

400
00:33:42,329 --> 00:33:44,089
Why are you taking it out on us?

401
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:45,529
What?

402
00:33:45,829 --> 00:33:47,559
Why? Am I wrong?

403
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,769
You want a fight with me?

404
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:52,670
- You want a piece of me? Bring it!
- Darn you!

405
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:54,440
How dare you!

406
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:57,039
Wait! Let me go!

407
00:33:57,109 --> 00:33:59,579
- Are you trying to fake a move?
- No!

408
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,210
What is that?

409
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:02,650
What's that?

410
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,279
What on earth is that?

411
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,989
Is that a fire?

412
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:13,090
- What's going on?
- What's this?

413
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,190
- What's this?
- What's this?

414
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,059
What is that?

415
00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:31,610
- Stop her!
- What are you doing?

416
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,110
What is this?

417
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,480
What's happening?

418
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,789
- Stop her!
- Get her off me!

419
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:06,280
Hey! What is that?

420
00:35:07,309 --> 00:35:10,150
Please step aside. Move.

421
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:18,019
Excuse me.

422
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:21,719
What was that?

423
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:25,360
Gosh, do you think
something's going on out there?

424
00:35:26,329 --> 00:35:28,099
I have plans this evening.

425
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,800
Are you having drinks again?

426
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,800
I don't want to do an autopsy on you.

427
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,210
Why would you do an autopsy on me?

428
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,809
No one knows who will die first.

429
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,679
My cell phone's not working.

430
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:49,289
- Ask them over the intercom.
- All right.

431
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:52,489
(Staff only)

432
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,559
Hi, this is the autopsy room.

433
00:35:55,659 --> 00:35:57,230
Is something going on out there?

434
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:31,730
(Mom, when are you coming home?)

435
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:37,530
Mom?

436
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:45,909
Get inside please. Be careful.

437
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:06,599
My baby. Mommy is here.

438
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,429
Open the door.

439
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,699
Mom?

440
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,969
- Please don't run and be careful.
- Hurry.

441
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:15,610
Could you please help me first?
Ma'am, please.

442
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,369
My goodness.

443
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:19,539
(Mom, when are you coming home?)

444
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,750
Oh, no. What do I do?

445
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:41,329
(Incoming video call)

446
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,599
(Mom)

447
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:45,969
Do Yoon.

448
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:49,340
Things are busy at the hospital.
So I'll be home late.

449
00:37:49,539 --> 00:37:52,309
I'll come as soon as I can
so wait a little longer.

450
00:37:57,409 --> 00:37:58,909
Mom, aren't you...

451
00:38:00,019 --> 00:38:02,079
in front of our house right now?

452
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:05,190
What? I'm still at the hospital.

453
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,800
Do Yoon, what's going on?

454
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:25,170
Do Yoon, can't you hear me? Jung Do Yoon.

455
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:31,909
What's...

456
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,719
My baby, my baby. Come here.

457
00:38:35,789 --> 00:38:37,320
Come to Mommy!

458
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:42,090
Do Yoon. Do Yoon!

459
00:38:58,369 --> 00:38:59,510
Do Yoon!

460
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:01,409
This way. Come this way!

461
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,110
Step aside please.

462
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,510
Just a moment.

463
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:08,880
Excuse me.

464
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:10,389
Things are crazy here too.

465
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,869
My goodness.

466
00:39:40,179 --> 00:39:42,690
Excuse me.

467
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:44,820
Excuse me, sir.

468
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,889
Sir?

469
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:50,789
Are you all right?

470
00:39:50,929 --> 00:39:53,800
What are you looking at?
What on earth are you looking at?

471
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,800
I'll gouge your eyes out.

472
00:40:00,769 --> 00:40:01,969
That man.

473
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:07,739
I'll gouge your eyes out.

474
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:10,349
I'll gouge your eyes out.

475
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:12,280
I've seen him in the mountains.

476
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:14,920
- What?
- His eyes were black then too.

477
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,289
Hey, wait.

478
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:24,489
Sir!

479
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,329
Sir...

480
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,960
Sir. Gosh.

481
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,070
My goodness.

482
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:40,539
What are you doing?

483
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:57,130
I'll gouge your eyes out.

484
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:00,900
I'll gouge your eyes out.

485
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,199
Are you all right? How...

486
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,510
Don't move!

487
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:24,519
(ER nurse Ban Ji Hyun)

488
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,199
I told you not to look at me like that.

489
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:39,130
I'll gouge your eyes out. Your eyes!

490
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:41,400
I'll gouge your eyes out.

491
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,469
I'll gouge your eyes out.

492
00:41:43,539 --> 00:41:47,480
I told you not to look at me like that.
I'll gouge your eyes out.

493
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,309
I'll gouge your eyes out.

494
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,480
Stop it.

495
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:26,980
Black eyes and black blood.

496
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,920
He isn't human.

497
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,590
How could this happen?

498
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:38,960
Detective. I need your help.

499
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,769
I think something happened to my daughter.

500
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:47,900
The woman's eyes were black like his.

501
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,880
Detective, please help me.

502
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,980
All right. I'll go with you.

503
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,679
Thank you.

504
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:02,889
I'll go get my car.

505
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:10,489
My father is here.

506
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,900
What about you?

507
00:43:21,269 --> 00:43:23,739
I think I should go find my friend.

508
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:26,679
Wait.

509
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:36,889
Something might happen to you again.

510
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,190
Be careful.

511
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,530
Thank you.

512
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:55,699
You should be careful too.

513
00:43:57,139 --> 00:43:58,210
Okay.

514
00:44:13,789 --> 00:44:15,789
Excuse me!

515
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:19,360
What in the world is happening?

516
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,400
It's...

517
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,670
Why did you kill him?

518
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:35,039
For now,

519
00:44:35,909 --> 00:44:38,349
make sure
the smoke doesn't enter the hospital.

520
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,780
Got it?

521
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,519
What? But...

522
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,500
Hyun Ho!

523
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:07,440
The armory.
How many guns do we have in the armory?

524
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:08,880
- Pardon?
- And bullets.

525
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,380
Hold on, I can't really explain it.

526
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,780
What are you saying?

527
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,920
Calm down, Soon Il. Calm down!

528
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:17,949
Officer Park, open the door quickly!

529
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:20,260
- Mr. Bae, sorry.
- Quickly!

530
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,460
The situation is a bit...

531
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:22,989
- Open the door!
- Isn't he asking to open the door?

532
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:25,090
- Stay still!
- Please save me.

533
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,530
Darn it, all right.

534
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:30,000
Come in quickly!

535
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:33,199
You scumbag.

536
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,869
- Do you have a death wish?
- Calm down. I'm sorry!

537
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,110
- How can you do this to me?
- I'm really sorry.

538
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:37,570
Goodness.

539
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,340
My phone's not working.

540
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,710
Hey, use the police radio...

541
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,980
to contact the Blue House
or the National Police Agency!

542
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:49,219
Officer Cho,
contact the National Police Agency.

543
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,389
- Pardon?
- Now!

544
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,289
Yes, sir.

545
00:45:54,889 --> 00:45:56,760
What are you doing over there?
It's dangerous!

546
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:59,860
Soon Il, why is it so quiet outside?

547
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,570
You see that? They've all gone crazy!

548
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,869
- What are all those people?
- Stay still.

549
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:09,769
Help me!

550
00:46:16,179 --> 00:46:17,179
They're gone.

551
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:21,320
Officer Cho, bring desks and chairs
to barricade the door!

552
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:23,590
Officer Park, Ji Hye will be fine, right?

553
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:24,690
Pull yourself together!

554
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:27,860
Get all the desks and chairs. Hurry up!

555
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,929
Get anything that can barricade the door.
Desks, chairs, everything!

556
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:32,789
We don't know when they'll come back.
Move it!

557
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,460
Faster, get them!

558
00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:39,300
Mr. Bae! Why are you just sitting around?

559
00:46:39,769 --> 00:46:42,469
Mr. Bae! What are you doing?

560
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:45,469
Mr. Bae.

561
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,510
Mr. Bae?

562
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,510
Look here! Mr. Bae.

563
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:52,679
Mr. Bae!

564
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:55,250
Wake up, Mr. Bae!

565
00:47:01,289 --> 00:47:02,289
Shoot!

566
00:47:10,469 --> 00:47:11,670
Hyun Ho, get out!

567
00:47:14,469 --> 00:47:16,170
Bring them all. Faster!

568
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,440
Stick them in here!

569
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:21,280
- Goodness.
- Hold that side!

570
00:47:23,849 --> 00:47:26,150
It's done. Go, go!

571
00:47:42,969 --> 00:47:45,969
Detective, will Do Yoon be all right?

572
00:47:46,699 --> 00:47:48,340
She'll be fine if she's in the house.

573
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:03,250
We don't have time,
so let's leave the car behind.

574
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:05,349
- Pardon?
- We might change like them.

575
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:07,260
We need to find your daughter before then.
Hurry up!

576
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,460
Okay.

577
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,480
Young Sik.

578
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,460
Young Sik!

579
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:18,260
Jung Do Yoon!

580
00:49:21,329 --> 00:49:22,329
Do Yoon...

581
00:49:36,909 --> 00:49:37,909
Do Yoon!

582
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:55,360
You were here, my baby!

583
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:02,070
Do Yoon. Do Yoon!

584
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:05,769
Do Yoon!

585
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,309
Do Yoon!

586
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,849
Do Yoon. Do Yoon!

587
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:15,480
Do Yoon.

588
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:17,650
Do Yoon!

589
00:50:21,989 --> 00:50:23,260
Jung Do Yoon!

590
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:28,059
Do Yoon! Jung Do Yoon!

591
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,400
Mom!

592
00:50:34,769 --> 00:50:36,070
I'm here!

593
00:50:36,139 --> 00:50:38,869
I'll go to you, Do Yoon!

594
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,340
Keep calling me!

595
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,380
Where are you?

596
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,269
Young Sik.

597
00:51:29,059 --> 00:51:31,789
- Young Sik.
- Why, Father?

598
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:33,960
Are you going to hit me again?

599
00:51:37,269 --> 00:51:39,530
I don't want to get beaten up anymore.

600
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,769
Stop hitting me!

601
00:51:43,969 --> 00:51:45,269
If you continue hitting me,

602
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,340
I'll kill you.

603
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:49,880
Young Sik.

604
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,449
Wake up.

605
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:55,920
I'll kill you!

606
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:32,289
Wake up, man!

607
00:53:11,929 --> 00:53:13,090
Do Yoon!

608
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,699
- I'm coming!
- Mom, where are you?

609
00:53:16,769 --> 00:53:18,929
Do Yoon!

610
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,099
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

611
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:22,670
I'm fine.

612
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,440
My baby.

613
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:27,539
Do Yoon, let's go.

614
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:29,380
Let's go.

615
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:38,690
You piece of trash.

616
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:41,360
Get your hands off Young Min.

617
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,559
I'm not Young Min!

618
00:53:44,659 --> 00:53:46,460
I'm Do Yoon. Jung Do Yoon!

619
00:53:55,269 --> 00:53:56,269
Young Min.

620
00:53:57,239 --> 00:53:58,940
Come to Mommy.

621
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:00,739
Mommy's sorry.

622
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,380
Get in!

623
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:15,019
Get in now!

624
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,960
Mom!

625
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,239
- Mom!
- Detective!

626
00:54:34,309 --> 00:54:36,309
Start the car now!

627
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:38,050
Mom!

628
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:40,650
Go!

629
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:47,320
Do Yoon! Listen to the detective.

630
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,519
Make sure to survive.

631
00:54:49,789 --> 00:54:51,360
- Okay?
- Mom!

632
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:55,260
Detective! Just go now!

633
00:54:57,969 --> 00:54:59,900
Mom...

634
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:08,079
I said, go!

635
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:09,710
Mom!

636
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:20,389
Hold on tight! It's dangerous!

637
00:55:22,059 --> 00:55:23,960
Mom...

638
00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:00,860
Mom...

639
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,170
Mom...

640
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:16,239
Ma'am?

641
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:19,510
Ma'am!

642
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:30,750
Are you okay?

643
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:33,519
Yes, I'm all right.

644
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,070
Let's go.

645
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:32,050
Kid!

646
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,559
Kid?

647
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:15,659
Kid!

648
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,659
If you hear this,
come to Muji High School.

649
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:19,659
- There's a shelter.
- To the school!

650
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:21,760
If you hear this,
come to Muji High School.

651
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:23,530
- There's a shelter.
- Let's hurry!

652
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:27,400
If you hear this,
come to Muji High School.

653
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,869
Kid!

654
00:59:29,869 --> 00:59:32,170
If you hear this,
come to Muji High School.

655
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:33,840
There's a shelter.

656
00:59:34,139 --> 00:59:35,679
If you hear this,
come to Muji High School.

657
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:37,150
There's a shelter.

658
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,530
The smoke is coming!

659
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:12,849
(We'd like to thank Jung Hae Kyun,)

660
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,320
(Ahn Eun Jin, and Tak Jae Hoon
for their appearance.)

661
01:00:31,769 --> 01:00:33,940
(Dark Hole)

662
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,369
We must save the people outside.

663
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:36,940
Our students are out there!

664
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:38,869
This is an emergency!

665
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,480
Do you want all of us to die?

666
01:00:43,309 --> 01:00:45,309
Our redemption is here!

667
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:47,980
I understand that we might
seem weird to you.

668
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:50,389
Why did you take the kid?

669
01:00:50,489 --> 01:00:54,090
I saw you.
That woman inhaled black smoke too.

670
01:00:54,289 --> 01:00:56,860
