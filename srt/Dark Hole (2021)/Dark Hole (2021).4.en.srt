Tae Han, we got a report.

12
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:07,640
It seems like Kang Soo stole money
from an arcade.

13
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:16,150
Nice.

14
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,620
Hey, Brother. You're home.

15
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,760
Come out here.

16
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,329
Hang on. It's the last round.

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,829
- I said, come out!
- It's the last round.

18
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,969
Why are you yelling at me?

19
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,769
Are you showing off now that you're a cop?

20
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,769
How can you steal
when your brother is a cop?

21
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,209
- What?
- You promised...

22
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,579
that you'd never steal again!

23
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,079
It wasn't me, okay?

24
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,150
All right.

25
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,819
Let's go down to the station.

26
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,219
It really wasn't me!

27
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,260
You're just the same.

28
00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:59,859
You should believe me
even if no one else does.

29
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,489
That's family!

30
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,060
How dare you talk back at me?

31
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:04,659
I just went there to play a game.

32
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:07,400
I kept our promise!

33
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,969
Hey!

34
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,780
Yes.

35
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,349
Are you sure?

36
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,620
It wasn't Kang Soo?

37
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,159
Okay.

38
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,550
(Tae Han, congratulations
on becoming a cop!)

39

Tae Han, congratulations
on becoming a cop!

40
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,520
I'll get you a real one later,
not a fake one.

41
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,759
I spent 10 dollars to win this.

42
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:34,319
- Is he badly hurt?
- Oh, no.

43
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:36,650
- He's bleeding so much.
- Somebody call 911.

44
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,560
- I think we should call 911.
- We're at...

45
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,330
- Call 911.
- There was an accident.

46
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:42,129
Please come fast.

47
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,000
- Oh, no...
- His helmet came off.

50
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:27,410
Look at that. It's there.

51
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:30,639
The surgical ward was shut down.

52
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:36,779
(Help! There are survivors here!)

53
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,120
Wait a minute.

54
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,689
Isn't that your wife?

55
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,589
That's my wife.

56
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,129
Baby, Daddy is off to work.
I'll be back soon.

57
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:56,800
Have a good day!

58
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,939
Ji Hye is in there!

59
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,550
No! Ji Hye!

60
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,019
What happened?

61
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:13,579
Why is your wife there?

62
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,889
She said she'd go to the hospital
because our baby is almost due.

63
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,319
I couldn't reach her,
so I thought she was at home.

64
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:22,290
How do we get there?

65
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,660
That ward was shut down,
so it's swarming with the infected.

66
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,860
It's too dangerous.

67
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,769
Then we just leave them?
With his wife like that?

68
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,069
What? Do you have a plan?

69
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,439
I don't know.
I'll just have to come up with one.

70
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,850
Hwa Seon!

71
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,129
Hwa Seon!

72
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:21,839
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

73
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,509
Let's get into the school building.

74
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,480
Let's go.

75
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,949
You're the one
who did the broadcast, aren't you?

76
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,509
I'm a teacher at this school.

77
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,949
And he is the school security guard.

78
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:34,019
Let's go in quickly.

79
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,250
All right. This way.

80
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,389
Go on in. I'll be right behind you.

81
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:56,409
Take the child and go!

82
00:08:58,409 --> 00:08:59,409
Let's go.

83
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,529

85

Are you okay?

90
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,779
What... What happened?

91
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,629
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine. I'm not hurt much.

92
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,529
- Did you hurt your arm?
- Yes, I think I sprained it.

93
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,470
- But I'm fine.
- Let me take a look.

94
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,669
I'm really okay.

95
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,340
- Let me see.
- Mr. Choi.

96
00:11:11,909 --> 00:11:13,879
What do you think you're doing?

97
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,710
What will you do
if these people here got infected too?

98
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:20,519
Sir, they are not infected.

99
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:23,490
They're just people who needed our help.

100
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,960
Then what about them?

101
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,799
If you put us in danger
just to save these two,

102
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,470
will you take full responsibility?

103
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,240
Mr. Seo, what are you waiting for?

104
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:40,340
Kick them out of here!

105
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,240
Enough.

106
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,179
I feel disgusted by you.

107
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:50,549
- What?
- Don't pretend you care about others.

108
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,320
I know you're doing this
only to protect yourself, Father!

How dare you...

110
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:58,889
Stop. The students are watching.

111
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,830
Let go of my arm.

112
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:02,289
I'm a police officer.

113
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,159
Do you want to be arrested for assault?

114
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:08,370
I know you're scared right now.

115
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:11,370
But we are not infected as you think.

116
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,440
How am I supposed to believe that?

117
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,279
Just look at my eyes.

118
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,350
Do my eyes look like
the ones of an infected?

119
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:32,659
I guess we'll have to wait and see
whether you're right or not.

120
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:38,600
Now, let go of my arm.
Are you trying to break it?

Really?

What will you do
with the infected inside the hospital?

137

She's with other people.

138

I'm sure she's safe there.

The rescue is on the way,
so let's just wait a little longer.

Don't lie.

You know
that no one's coming to rescue us.

142

I'll go with you.

You know the building well, right?

144
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,870
Take us to the 5th floor surgical ward.

Wait, wait, wait.

147
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,879
What do you mean
you're going to another ward?

148
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:05,450
There are survivors on another floor.

149

We're going to rescue them.

150

Is there anyone else who wants to help?

151
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,590
Wait a minute.

152
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,789
So you're saying
you're going to rescue those people?

153
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,490
Is that why you're making such a fuss?

154
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,759
A fuss? To save people?

155
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:19,460
Yes, you are making such a fuss.

156

What if the infected get in here?

157

- What will you do if that happens?
- If those people were your family,

158

would you have said the same?

What do you think?

166
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:52,659
I got fired.

167
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,330
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

168
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,370
Why would you be?

169
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,570
What? Well...

170
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:04,610
I don't know who's responsible for this,
but if I catch that son of a gun...

171
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:07,950
Don't overreact.
I'll be just fine without this job.

172
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:13,120
Let's go have a drink.

173
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,629
What? You know I'm not making things up.

174
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,600
Isn't that right, Officer Park?

175
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:32,070
So don't make a fuss.

176
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,710
Get lost if you're not here to help.

177
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,980
Nobody's going to help out, right?

178
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,620
Let's just go by ourselves.

179
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,159
Soon Il.

180
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:13,679
- Darn it.
- Where are you going?

181
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,990
Hey, do you still wear that?

182
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:30,830
Let's go.

183
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:36,269
My goodness.

184
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,940
- It'll be dangerous.
- Gosh.

185
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,440
(Fire Blockage)

186
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:16,710
Please try to hold it in
and breathe slowly.

187
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,519
(4th Floor,
Nurse Station, Negative Pressure Room)

188
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:32,920
(Second Basement,
Autopsy Room, Underground Parking Lot)

189
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:39,799
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

190
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:44,000
Do you think she can make it to
the 4th floor Negative Pressure Room?

191
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,069
What are you planning?

192
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,609
Excuse me. You're not planning
to get out of here, are you?

193
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:54,109
The infected disappeared just now.

194
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:56,210
Now is the time to get moving.

195
00:17:56,349 --> 00:17:58,619
You're going to open the door?

196
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,519
Then should we all just die here?

197
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,559
Still, it's dangerous
to head out by ourselves!

198
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:08,859
I think it's better to wait for
a rescue team or the police.

199
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,089
Isn't it?

200
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,299
I also think it'll be more dangerous
for us to go out.

201
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,900
Her condition is not looking good.

202
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,700
We need to get her to safety quickly.

203
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:21,769
Darn it! Nowhere's safe now.

204
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,410
Wouldn't the Negative Pressure Room
on the 4th floor be safe?

205
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,609
You're right. The place is equipped
with an air pressure regulator,

206
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,150
so we can block out the smoke.

207
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,390
The door is also double-layered, so the
infected won't be able to get in easily.

208
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,589
Look. Maybe we can get there by ourselves,

209
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,559
but how can we go all the way there
with a pregnant woman?

210
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,430
If the infected suddenly attacks,
what will we do?

211
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:46,829
I'll try my best to stop them.

212
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,769
I'll lead the way. The rest of you,

213
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:55,069
focus on protecting her.

214
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,309
What should we do?

215
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:00,880
Hey,

216
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,849
let's stop overthinking.

217
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,180
Whatever happens,

218
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,250
it's best to listen to someone
who works for the government.

219
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,990
Darn it.

220
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,589
All right.

221
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,529
Then grab something
you can use as a weapon.

222
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:26,240
Thank you for your work.

223
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,309
Are you all right?

224
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,079
Thank you for your help earlier.

225
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,250
It must've been difficult
to muster up the courage.

226
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:40,779
It's nothing.

227
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:43,390
It's best to save as many as possible.

228
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:48,430
But why did the black smoke
and the infected...

229
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:50,559
suddenly disappear earlier?

230
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:56,599
I think they reacted to a bizarre sound
with high frequency.

231
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,299
High-frequency sound?

232
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:03,569
I didn't hear anything.

233
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,180
Really?

234
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,480
Yes.

235
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:19,589
The sound that only you can hear,

236
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,589
what do you think it is?

237
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,490
I'm not sure,

238
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,230
but judging from
how all the infected stopped attacking,

239
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,529
I think they're being controlled
by something.

240
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,880
Right, I forgot to introduce myself.

241
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,650
I'm Choi Seung Tae.

242
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:47,420
I'm Detective Lee Hwa Seon from Seoul.

243
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,839
Move, you punk!

244
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,509
What happened here?

245
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,940
What...

246
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,579
What...

247
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:20,180
What on earth happened here?

248
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:22,220
This is bad!

249
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,359
The number you’ve reached
is not available.

250
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,690
Darn it!

251
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:39,240
You punk,
didn't I tell you to watch over this?

252
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,269
- I did!
- Then,

253
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:43,539
why is the door broken,

254
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:45,640
and why is there no cow at all?

255
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:49,950
You punk, what were you doing...

256
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,680
when all my cows disappeared?

257
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,119
You scum!

258
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,339
Who are you?

259
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:24,480
You're chosen by him.

260
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,319
You'll meet him soon.

261
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:31,210
How are things going?

262
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,049
Are you all right?

263
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,619
Yes, I'm fine.

264
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,759
Everything seems fine for now.

265
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:48,400
They should be careful
not to run into the infected.

266
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:53,670
Doctor, I'll go check the generator.

267
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,769
Sure, go ahead.

268
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,220
Hey, all the infected here disappeared!

269
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,160
(Muji Hospital, 2nd Floor)

270
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,410
Is there no other way to get there?

271
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,440
Hold on.

272
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,640
Can you hear me?

273
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,750
Yes, this is the security room.

274
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:38,420
Let me see.

275
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:40,579
If you turn to the corner
from where you are,

276
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,490
there's an emergency staircase
at the end of the corridor on the left.

277
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:45,259
There's no one there.

278
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,680
- It's too dangerous to leave now.
- Let me go.

279
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,220
- No, you can't.
- Look!

280
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:52,660
The smoke is gone,
and I can't see the infected.

281
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,619
How long should I stay here?

282
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,930
Whether it's an army base or another city,

283
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,529
we must do something.

284
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:01,160
Darn it, you're so noisy.

285
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,329
Look here.

286
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:06,970
They say they want to leave,
why are you stopping them for?

287
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,809
Let me get some sleep, will you?

288
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:12,579
My kid and my wife are waiting for me.

289
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,009
You expect me to stay here and do nothing?

290
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:18,210
You can stay here. I'm going to leave.

291
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:22,720
If there's anyone who wants to leave,
come with me.

292
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,390
Where will he go?

293
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,289
- We can't leave yet.
- We shouldn't leave.

294
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,519
I'm leaving too.

295
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,759
- Let's go.
- We're also leaving.

296
00:26:30,829 --> 00:26:32,130
Okay, let's go.

297
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,660
Dad.

298
00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:38,170
What are you doing?

299
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:41,269
Where are you going?

300
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,380
Dad. Don't go.

301
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:50,779
Dad.

302
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,480
Dad. Don't leave us.

303
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,720
Please open the door.

304
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,390
How can you leave alone?

305
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,559
Let go.

306
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:02,630
Let go of me!

307
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:08,730
Honey! You can't leave us!

308
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:11,500
Dad! Save me!

309
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,500
- Dad.
- Be quiet.

310
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:15,309
She's crazy. Everyone's watching.

311
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:17,539
- Please take us with you!
- No.

312
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:19,079
- You piece of trash!
- It's not what you think.

313
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,480
How can you leave us?

314
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:22,150
I'm not your husband!

315
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:25,279
You'll all die if you go outside.

316
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,019
Who are you?

317
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:28,920
Go ahead and leave.

318
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:33,859
You'll be punished severely
if you don't do as I say.

319
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,500
You can show them yourself.

320
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:44,130
You lunatic.
What kind of shaman witchery is this?

321
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,799
Let's go.

322
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,799
- Let's go now.
- All right.

323
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,839
- Wait.
- I'm leaving voluntarily.

324
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,170
- Don't go.
- Come on.

325
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,539
- Where is he going?
- What does he think he's doing?

326
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:55,509
- Don't go.
- My goodness.

327
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,150
He really left.

328
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,400
What was that about? She's such bad luck.

329
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:17,930
What?

330
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,700
It's nothing. Let's get going.

331
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:25,309
He showed me everything.

332
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:03,049
- Hey! Open the door!
- Get lost, you punk!

333
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:05,619
- Open the door!
- Come on!

334
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,119
Why won't it start?

335
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,819
Open the door! Open it!

336
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,289
Help me! Help me!

337
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,089
Darn it.

338
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,789
Why won't it start?

339
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,730
- They're dead.
- Did they really die?

340
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,029
My goodness.

341
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:26,440
You were right.

342
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,970
You said we'll all die if we go outside.

343
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,109
And they did.

344
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,609
- Yes.
- They should've listened to her.

345
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,839
- That's so scary.
- What will we do?

346
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,309
- Poor them.
- He insisted on leaving.

347
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,849
That shaman is going to make a bloodbath.

348
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,940
- My goodness.
- Will you look at it?

349
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,410
I'm sorry, sir.

350
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,079
The kids must've never hammered
a nail in their lives.

351
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:16,450
You should've taught them well
if they're not good at it!

352
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:18,289
Must I tell you everything?

353
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:19,960
No, sir. I'm so sorry.

354
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:23,390
Are you kidding me?

355
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,329
Jin Seok, let go of this.

356
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,930
Mister, are you joking?

357
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,940
You can have these pickles
all by yourselves.

358
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,799
Eat them. Eat them!

359
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:35,869
Hey!

360
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:40,410
What are you doing to a teacher?

361
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:45,549
Do you still think I'm your student?

362
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,950
Hey, you guys expelled me.

363
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:52,289
Why are you acting like
a teacher when you expelled me?

364
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:53,559
Hey, little boy.

365
00:30:56,789 --> 00:30:57,630
What?

366
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,299
Why are you being a picky eater
if you're not a kid?

367
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:05,369
Oh, I see. Are you acting up
because you're a cop?

368
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,440
Darn you.

369
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,009
Hey...

370
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:20,180
Enough.

371
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Open your eyes.

372
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,279
Get up.

373
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,730
What? What are you all looking at?

374
00:32:26,349 --> 00:32:27,950
Grandma called you to eat.

375
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,390
- Look over there. Do you see it?
- What?

376
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,819
Over there.

377
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:35,789
With that, we can play catch. Right?

378
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,250
Do Yoon, you're so brave!

379
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:08,859
You can do it!

380
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:50,230
Hey! It's dangerous! Come back quick!

381
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,470
Hey!

382
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:21,199
Why did you do that?

383
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,269
Don't you know what happens
if you inhale the smoke?

384
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,969
Tell me! Why did you go outside?

385
00:34:27,269 --> 00:34:29,369
To fight the infected...

386
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:31,369
we need a gun.

387
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:33,539
You're a cop.

388
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:39,519
Wait.

389
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,429
Your name is Do Yoon, right?

390
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,699
Wow, I'm impressed, Do Yoon.

391
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:01,340
You were really brave.

392
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:07,340
But you can't do
something like this ever again.

393
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:08,510
All right?

394
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:12,949
Why don't you go inside first?

395
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,219
I need to talk to the detective.
We'll be right there with you.

396
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,190
Do Yoon.

397
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:38,210
You may be good at catching criminals.

398
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:41,739
But it seems you're not good at
talking to children.

399
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,150
What she did was reckless.

400
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:48,849
She knows that too.

401
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,920
She knew that,
but she went out risking everything...

402
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:53,260
for you.

403
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,489
Maybe it's not my place to say this but...

404
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,199
Try not to shut people out.

405
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,400
Because right now,
we have to get through this together.

406
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,980
First, I'll put tripe on a perilla leaf.

407
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:19,280
Then put noodles on it. What next?

408
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,280
- Garlic.
- Right, garlic.

409
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:22,889
- Then I'll wrap...
- Yes, make a wrap.

410
00:36:22,949 --> 00:36:24,150
And put it in my mouth.

411
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,190
What are you, a pig?
Why would you eat my wrap?

412
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,559
You kids know nothing about food.

413
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,690
He even tried to steal my food earlier.

414
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,000
Haven't you heard about Ram-Don?

415
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:36,269
Mix it with your right hand
and mix it with your left hand.

416
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:39,170
That's Bibimmyeon commercial,
you ignorant pig.

417
00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:42,369
Darn it.

418
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:46,880
Be quiet, little brats.

419
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:50,480
What are you looking at? What do you want?

420
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,849
Are you crazy, you little jerk?

421
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,550
Stop trying to intimidate us and get lost.

422
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,449
You weren't so strong
in front of that detective.

423
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:03,730
Have you all gone crazy?

424
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:06,360
What? What do you want from us?

425
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:12,340
Just wait and see what I'll do to you.

426
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:19,139
He should be embarrassed.
Why are you up? Lie down.

427
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,840
Should we just gang up on him?

428
00:37:21,909 --> 00:37:23,309
- Should we?
- Yes, let's.

429
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,679
- Just be quiet.
- Darn it.

430
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:31,889
Honey, why are you alone?
Where did your mother go?

431
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:34,190
She's...

432
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,559
not my mother.

433
00:37:38,429 --> 00:37:39,929
My mother is...

434
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,699
It's okay. It's okay.

435
00:37:43,269 --> 00:37:46,170
You don't have to say it. I know.

436
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:50,110
Let's go get something to eat with Chang.

437
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,360
What are you doing?

438
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,869
You're having so much fun, aren't you?

439
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,369
What are you talking about?

440
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,440
You think you have something on me.

441
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,909
Just tell them.

442
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:25,440
Tell them and I'll kill everyone.

443
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,880
I told you before.

444
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,349
Tell me how you're going to kill me.

445
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,289
A creative way to kill me.

446
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:39,119
Tell me if anything pops into your head.

447
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,960
But I doubt your stupid head
will come up with one.

448
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:25,800
Do Yoon! Listen to the detective.

449
00:39:25,869 --> 00:39:28,239
Make sure you survive. Okay?

450
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:33,440
Detective! Just go now!

451
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,179
My mom...

452
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:42,320
always found me wherever I hid.

453
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,360
It's okay now.

454
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,000
It's cold at night.

455
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,699
Thank you.

456
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,940
Children easily become friends.

457
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:12,349
I'm sure you'll be a good friend to her.

458
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:19,989
I don't know how to treat her.

459
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,329
When I look into her eyes,
I can see how desperate she is.

460
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,070
But I'm not sure if I can protect her.

461
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,570
I'm scared.

462
00:40:35,739 --> 00:40:36,969
Well...

463
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:40,110
What she wants from you right now...

464
00:40:41,179 --> 00:40:42,340
is...

465
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:46,280
just being there for her.

466
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:50,849
So don't try too hard to do something.

467
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:20,449
What was that?

468
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,179
Quiet down.

469
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,860
This is Doctor Han.

470
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,130
Yes.

471
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,960
There's an emergency exit
at the cardiovascular center.

472
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:37,400
It seems like the fastest way.

473
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,670
Yes. Got it.

474
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,119
(Muji Hospital, 3rd Floor)

475
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:00,989
The power of authority.

476
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:19,909
(Muji Hospital, 4th Floor)

477
00:42:49,539 --> 00:42:50,940
What is it?

478
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:57,510
I think it's nothing.

479
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,719
Let's move.

480
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:02,380
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

481
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:07,559
I should stay strong
for the sake of my baby.

482
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,500
Wait.

483
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,800
Look at that.

484
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,110
Why are they going that way?

485
00:43:26,139 --> 00:43:28,010
Isn't that the 4th floor?

486
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:30,909
The negative pressure room.

487
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,610
The smoke can't get in the room there.

488
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:34,280
They're going to the negative
pressure room because it's safe.

489
00:43:35,219 --> 00:43:36,250
Can you hear me?

490
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,460
People on the 5th floor... the 4th floor.

491
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:41,059
Not the 5th floor...

492
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,389
What is she saying?

493
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:46,059
People on the 5th floor...

494
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:48,159
are going to the negative pressure room
on the 4th floor.

495
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,269
It's not the 5th floor, but the 4th floor.

496
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,340
Can you hear my...

497
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,010
The 4th floor?

498
00:43:58,409 --> 00:43:59,780
Why the 4th floor?

499
00:44:00,409 --> 00:44:01,739
She said the 4th floor.

500
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:03,610
Give me that.

501
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,280
Say that again.

502
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:13,989
Say that again.

503
00:44:14,059 --> 00:44:16,360
Officer Cho, can you hear my voice?

504
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:40,380
What's wrong?

505
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:46,590
Well, that jailer somehow looks familiar.

506
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,489
What do you mean?

507
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:52,059
It's nothing.

508
00:44:52,829 --> 00:44:54,659
I must be on edge.

509
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:42,039
Run!

510
00:46:16,409 --> 00:46:17,480
Get in quickly!

511
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:43,969
See that? Authority.

512
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,579
You should've shot earlier.

513
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:51,150
I thought I was going to die!

514
00:47:16,869 --> 00:47:19,070
The ones who do not accept me will die.

515
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,780
The ones who do not accept me will die.

516
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:25,650
They shall all die.

517
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,349
The ones who do not accept...

518
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:30,789
shall die.

519
00:47:31,219 --> 00:47:33,559
The ones who do not accept me will die.

520
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:37,559
The ones who do not accept me will die.

521
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:27,309
Tell me what you want.

522
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:29,510
I'll grant you your wish.

523
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,769
Accept me.

524
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:58,369
Then you can take revenge!

525
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:00,940
Who are you?

526
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,179
Why did you stop the attack?

527
00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:05,849
Because it's fun.

528
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:09,179
I can toy with them however I like.

529
00:50:53,389 --> 00:50:54,690
Who on earth did this?

530
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:11,670
Sir!

531
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:15,380
Wake up! Are you okay? Sir!

532
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:17,079
Sir!

533
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:20,719
We should quickly take him to the shelter.

534
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:23,449
We can't take him there.
Others will get scared.

535
00:51:23,849 --> 00:51:26,119
Then there's a consultation room.

536
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:27,889
- Let's take him there.
- Okay.

537
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:30,130
- Hurry up!
- My gosh.

538
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:31,929
Hang in there.

539
00:51:31,989 --> 00:51:33,030
This way.

540
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,400
Hurry up!

541
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,440
Quickly.

542
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:46,070
Hurry up.

543
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:49,539
Here you go.

544
00:51:54,449 --> 00:51:56,079
Do you have any medicine for first aid?

545
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:59,860
Medicine that can treat a wound
this bad is in the infirmary.

546
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,420
We can't go to the annex.
There are too many of the infected.

547
00:52:02,489 --> 00:52:05,130
If he's not treated, he'll go into shock
from losing too much blood!

548
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:10,900
I'll go.

549
00:52:12,369 --> 00:52:14,099
Just tell me where the infirmary is.

550
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:16,239
But it's too dangerous to go to the annex.

551
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:19,980
You two helped me as well,
despite the danger.

552
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:22,280
What do you need?

553
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:25,309
Surgical instruments to close the wound,
hydrocolloid dressing,

554
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:28,480
bandages, painkillers,
and hydrogen peroxide.

555
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:31,119
Please bring povidone and dry powder
just in case.

556
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,920
Also, bring all the painkillers
and anti-inflammatory drugs you can find.

557
00:52:33,989 --> 00:52:35,059
Got it.

558
00:52:41,929 --> 00:52:42,929
Detective.

559
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,329
Do you think
this is a civil defense drill?

560
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:50,670
This is an actual situation!

561
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:54,380
So stop running around
without my permission, got it?

562
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:57,079
If he doesn't get treated fast,
he might die.

563
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:59,179
Yes, he might die,

564
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:02,880
and everyone else here would die because of you.

565
00:53:04,019 --> 00:53:07,219
I'm the owner of this school.
I'm the one in charge.

566
00:53:07,289 --> 00:53:11,329
I'm responsible
for the safety of the people here.

567
00:53:11,389 --> 00:53:13,130
You can't even take responsibility
for one person,

568
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,130
so how can you take responsibility
for everyone?

569
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,170
Isn't it strange?

570
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:21,599
There's always that one bad apple...

571
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:24,139
which spoils the whole barrel.

572
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:26,980
- What?
- This is why...

573
00:53:27,809 --> 00:53:31,280
order and control are most important.

574
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:34,880
We can't spoil the whole barrel
just because of one rotten apple...

575
00:53:34,949 --> 00:53:36,820
that came out of nowhere, can we?

576
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:42,119
Tell me honestly. What do you really want?

577
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,300
You can remain here under my authority,

578
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:52,030
or you can go get the medicine...

579
00:53:52,099 --> 00:53:53,699
and leave the school.

580
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:00,239
Fine.

581
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,349
I'll leave the school
once I get the medicine.

582
00:54:03,409 --> 00:54:04,449
Detective.

583
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:07,750
Oh, right. I forgot.

584
00:54:08,449 --> 00:54:10,989
Since you came with the kid,
you should take her too.

585
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:14,119
That's enough, Father.
Anyone who leaves this place dies!

586
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:17,289
Sacrifice is needed to save everyone else!

587
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:20,730
Don't you agree?

588
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,469
Chairman Choi, isn't it too harsh
to kick out the kid?

589
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:32,570
Then you should go outside instead.

590
00:54:36,949 --> 00:54:38,079
Dong Rim.

591
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:41,519
Wow, Han Dong Rim.

592
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,650
I have a plan.

593
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:46,219
What do you mean?

594
00:54:46,289 --> 00:54:48,719
There's a way you can go to the infirmary
while avoiding the infected.

595
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:50,260
You're out of your mind.

596
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,030
Follow me.

597
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,400
The quickest way to the infirmary
is to cross this overpass.

598
00:54:59,469 --> 00:55:00,639
(Overpass)

599
00:55:00,699 --> 00:55:02,139
But as we all fled here,

600
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:04,369
we locked all the doors
to keep the infected out.

601
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:06,409
What about the keys?

602
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:09,780
Well, the teacher who had the keys...

603
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:12,849
got infected.

604
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:15,619
We can get there without the keys.

605
00:55:15,849 --> 00:55:18,320
- What?
- This door is broken.

606
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:21,289
What are you doing?

607
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:24,090
They were saying
the door wouldn't lock so I checked.

608
00:55:24,289 --> 00:55:25,929
And it seems I have to change the latch.

609
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:27,960
Do you have to change the whole thing?

610
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:37,539
Gosh, you guys are so frustrating.

611
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:39,610
Why are you here?

612
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,849
Well, I wanted to help.

613
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:47,349
What do you really want?

614
00:55:48,949 --> 00:55:52,719
How can I just sit and watch
when a man is dying?

615
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,090
I'm not that horrible.

616
00:55:55,219 --> 00:55:59,130
Besides, even if the door is open
like she said,

617
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:02,500
how will you pass the study hall corridor?

618
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:05,329
You don't know where
and how many infected there are.

619
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,170
The three of you are
just going to fight through them?

620
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:13,809
Are you saying you have another plan?

621
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:20,820
Well, you know, I'm good with tricks.

622
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:24,849
Then tell us what your trick is.

623
00:56:28,659 --> 00:56:32,059
Detective, are you
good at distracting others?

624
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:35,960
Hey.

625
00:57:37,789 --> 00:57:39,630
- Do you hear me?
- What's this?

626
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:41,030
Where is it coming from?

627
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:45,469
- It's not from mine.
- Yes, Detective.

628
00:57:46,099 --> 00:57:49,800
I know it's hard to believe,
but I saw something in the smoke.

629
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:52,570
The black smoke isn't the end of it.

630
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:56,210
What do you mean
the black smoke isn't the end?

631
00:57:57,309 --> 00:57:58,909
Inside the black smoke,

632
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:02,619
there's a being we do not know about.

633
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,519
Be careful.

634
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,159
Detective. Detective.

635
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:11,929
Which detective? Who is it?

636
00:58:12,329 --> 00:58:14,000
She's a detective from Seoul.

637
00:58:16,329 --> 00:58:19,570
She clearly said there's something
inside the black smoke.

638
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:21,599
What?

639
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:36,420
(A day ago)

640
00:58:37,719 --> 00:58:39,219
We cleaned out his stomach,

641
00:58:39,289 --> 00:58:40,789
but we found pesticides.

642
00:58:41,219 --> 00:58:44,030
He can go home when he gets up
and after he's done with the IV.

643
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:00,809
Hello, Chief. It's me.

644
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:05,679
I think he drank pesticide. Yes.

645
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:09,150
I'll get back to the station
once he's done with his IV.

646
00:59:29,139 --> 00:59:30,170
What of the emergency power?

647
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:32,340
Check the vitals
of the patient in Room 503.

648
01:00:23,289 --> 01:00:24,530
Sir.

649
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:37,170
(Exit)

650
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:51,889
(We'd like to thank Lee Cheol Min
for his special appearance.)

651
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:10,969
(Dark Hole)

652
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:13,070
The black smoke...

653
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,579
is watching us, not attacking us.

654
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:19,809
So you must not trust people.
You should trust him.

655
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,480
This is the mark of the chosen.

656
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:23,449
