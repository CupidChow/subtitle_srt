12
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:12,739
You should go to college
and become a great person...

13
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,280
for the sake of your late father.

14
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,450
That's how you can become
a good daughter.

15
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,290
Write the cause of his death
as illness in the medical note.

16
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:27,760
Are you sure you won't do this?

17
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:30,400
All you have to do
is walk into the motel.

18
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:32,230
We'll take care of everything else.

19
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:35,230
Raise your head
so that I can see your face. Look at me.

20
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,579
Stop lying!

21
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,409
I know you lied to the police.

22
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,750
Do you have a death wish?

23
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,300
All those who do not accept me will die.

24
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,199
All those who do not accept me will die.

25
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:15,569
All those who do not accept me will die.

26
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,939
All those who do not accept me will die.

27
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:35,889
- Be careful.
- Let's go.

28
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,900
Let's hurry.

(Episode 11)

31
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:13,099
I was trying to find a way
to save people.

32
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,900
Even though I kept failing.

33
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,939
Detective, you said...

34
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,009
that there's something controlling
the black smoke and the infected, right?

35
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,080
Yes. You're right.

36
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,250
It was controlling us until now.

37
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,520
What did you want to show me?

38
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,340
What was that?

39
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:03,580
What on earth are you doing?

40
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,319
Whenever a new virus emerges,

41
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,990
how do you think vaccines are made?

42
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,459
Did you think we got it
with no sacrifices?

43
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:23,300
What on earth have you been doing?

44
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:31,540
I wondered why the shaman
suddenly stopped attacking.

45
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,040
The shaman...

46
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:36,550
only let the people here live
because of you. To protect you!

47
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:40,180
Are you suspecting me?

48
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,490
Whatever you are,

49
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,790
if you really got over the smoke,

50
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,889
then you could provide a cure.

51
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,410
Stop.

52
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:51,319
How dare you...

53
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,600
(Liquid Nitrogen)

54
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,680
The monster's weakness.

55
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,490
(Liquid Nitrogen)

56
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,629
(Liquid Nitrogen)

57
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:46,180
What happened?

58
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,050
Who are the people...

59
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,490
who weren't there?

60
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:02,129
They're Dong Rim and Na Se Na.

61
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:05,459
What have you been doing?

62
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:09,629
I heard something,
so I came to see what's going on.

63
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,100
Were you alone the whole time?

64
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,110
What?

65
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,139
She was with me.

66
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,410
We were talking in the hallway.

67
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:23,779
She must've come here
when I went to the toilet.

68
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,850
What's going on?

69
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,060
(Police)

70
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:40,569
So this is why they say
you can't trust anyone.

71
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,930
How could she have done that?

72
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,199
What happened to the monster?

73
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,410
When it was attacking us,

74
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:51,040
it got stuck in a gas barrel.

75
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,910
Then it ran away.

76
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,350
Do you know...

77
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:57,579
what LN2 is?

78
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,519
It's liquid nitrogen.

79
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,290
Liquid nitrogen.

80
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,889
When liquid nitrogen touched its skin,

81
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,930
it got frozen.

82
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,129
It's ultra-low temperature
liquefied gas.

83
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,300
Anyone who touches it
will get cold burns.

84
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,930
I think we can figure out...

85
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:18,370
which body the monster is hiding in.

86
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,769
When liquid nitrogen touched its skin,

87
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:25,339
I could hear the pain in its voice.

88
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,850
I could also feel the pain myself.

89
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,449
So if liquid nitrogen touches the host,

90
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,779
the monster will react to it.

91
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,690
And I'm sure I will feel that.

92
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,519
That means we need liquid nitrogen.

93
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,590
What do we do?
The nitrogen in the room all evaporated.

94
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,299
I think you can find some
at the dermatology unit.

95
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:48,330
I heard they use nitrogen
to remove corns.

96
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,529
The dermatology unit.

97
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,370
You guys take some rest.
I'll go find it.

98
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,909
Tae Han, wait.

99
00:08:56,309 --> 00:08:58,539
- Why?
- Let's get ready first.

100
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,350
- Are you coming with me?
- How can I let you go alone?

101
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,019
Okay, then.

102
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,220
Let's take a short rest.

103
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:08,750
How come you don't take a break?

104
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,620
Do you know how old I am?

105
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,460
Him Chan, I'm sorry.

106
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:23,500
I should be able to protect you.

107
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,240
Hyun Ho, what's going on?
Is everything okay?

108
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,779
What? Yes, everything's fine.

109
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,879
Don't worry about it.

110
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,149
I won't let anyone separate us.

111
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,850
What do you mean?

112
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,820
Why would anyone separate us?

113
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:49,490
Do they know I inhaled the...

114
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:52,159
No. No one knows yet.

115
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,470
Were you alive?

116
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,419
Ji Hye.

117
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:14,320
Hyun Ho.

118
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,519
They're trying to take our Him Chan.

119
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,990
Don't worry. No one else is here.

120
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:22,090
I'm so scared.

121
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,169
I'll do anything to protect you.

122
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
I love you.

123
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
It's okay.

124
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:40,879
It's okay.

125
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:43,549
Listen to the detective.

126
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,820
Make sure you survive.

127
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,850
Mom!

128
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,620
I said, go!

129
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,470
Do Yoon.

130
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:10,070
What's wrong?

131
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,580
Him Chan just fell asleep.

132
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,940
You'll wake him up.

133
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,250
Come on. Let's go.

134
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,429
(Sulfadiazine
for second and third-degree burns)

135
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,769
What are you doing?

136
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,940
I was going to change the bandage.

137
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,610
Do you want me to help?

138
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:49,080
No thanks. I can do it later.

139
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:52,580
Are you looking for something?

140
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,019
Do you know where I can find
a map of the hospital building?

141
00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:58,389
Well...

142
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:03,730
It's in the brochure of the hospital.
You'll find it in the hallway.

143
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,659
I saw it when I came here
with my grandmother.

144
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,070
Should I go get one for you?

145
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,200
No, I'll go find it.

146
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,789
It's ultra-low temperature
liquefied gas.

147
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,220
Anyone who touches it
will get cold burns.

148
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:09,360
When liquid nitrogen touched its skin,

149
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:11,500
I could hear the pain in its voice.

150
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,029
I could also feel the pain myself.

151
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:29,309
Hey. Dong Rim.

152
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:33,279
Do you want to say something to me?

153
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:40,019
This book. Can you explain it to me?

154
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:43,830
Everyone whose name is
written in here...

155
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,259
either got killed by the monster
or became infected.

156
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,370
And they are all...

157
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:50,830
You're right.

158
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:55,309
They are people who I hated so much
that I wanted to kill them.

159
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:59,039
You could have just told the rest
when we were with them just now.

160
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,710
Why didn't you?

161
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:03,549
Just because you hate someone...

162
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,950
to the point of wanting to kill them,

163
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,590
it doesn't necessarily mean
you'll become a monster.

164
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,919
Just like how the detective...

165
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:16,230
didn't become infected
even though she inhaled the black smoke.

166
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,000
What do you think of me then?

167
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,470
I believe you'll be like her as well.

168
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,100
This is where we are,

169
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:56,529
so the path adjacent
to the Professor's Room...

170
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,740
is the only way there.

171
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:00,669
There might be infected in this area.

172
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:02,669
We should just go through them.

173
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:04,840
Do you think you have multiple lives?

174
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:06,240
Why are you so rash?

175
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:07,409
You'll come anyway.

176
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,889
Excuse me, Detective.
Do you have a moment?

177
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,649
Yes.

178
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,090
What is it?

179
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,200
Well...

180
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:29,399
You're suspecting Dong Rim, aren't you?

181
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,500
Yes, I am.

182
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,139
I'm more suspicious about Ms. Na.

183
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,940
She even ran away from the storage room.

184
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,779
If Ms. Na is really the host,

185
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:47,379
she revealed herself too easily
compared to how well she hid till now.

186
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,690
It's as if it was staged for us to see.

187
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,490
But it's Ms. Na who attacked,

188
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,559
and Dong Rim is the victim.

189
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:57,230
She might have been controlled
by the monster.

190
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,159
It doesn't really make sense
for Dong Rim to control Ms. Na...

191
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,269
to attack her, does it?

192
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,110
I kept an eye on Dong Rim,
and there was nothing out of ordinary.

193
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:11,779
Mr. Choi, why do you care for Dong Rim
so much?

194
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,309
Because I'm a teacher.

195
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:16,080
Please tell me honestly.

196
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,820
I don't think it's just because
you're a teacher.

197
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,649
Actually...

198
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,789
(My Daughter)

199
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,490
The hit-and-run driver who killed
Dong Rim's father...

200
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:32,200
is my father.

201
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,629
I saw him use his money and power...

202
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:40,370
to bribe people
to cover up the accident, but...

203
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:44,740
I didn't do anything like a coward.

204
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,679
But not this time.

205
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:52,350
Even if Dong Rim is the monster's host
as you suspect,

206
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:53,679
this time...

207
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,590
This time, I'll protect her
until the end.

208
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:24,809
Officer Park, are you out for a stroll?

209
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,140
Snake Eyes.

210
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,849
It's you again?

211
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,910
Are you guys close?

212
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:35,720
It looks like
you still don't know anything.

213
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:39,319
Officer.

214
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,160
have you not told him yet?

215
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:43,460
Snake Eyes!

216
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,430
Don't trust people easily.
You'll be backstabbed by them again.

217
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,599
Got it?

218
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,069
See you next time, Officer.

219
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,839
What's up with that jerk?

220
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,019
Are you hiding something from me?

221
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,319
- No.
- Then why are you intimidated by him?

222
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:10,190
Intimidated by him?

223
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,490
I'm Park Soon Il.

224
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,460
Detective, I'll lead the way.

225
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,670
What's all this?

226
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:31,240
Can't you see?

227
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,650
It's done by those punks.

228
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,490
I just let them be
because the shaman told me to,

229
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:45,059
but they're taking it too far.

230
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:46,619
Pardon?

231
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,359
Ma'am.

232
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,200
When you were giving out food
in the lobby,

233
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,759
didn't you see those lowlifes...

234
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:57,000
going against the shaman
with their weapons?

235
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,470
They have cops with them,
so they won't simply kill people.

236
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,440
Isn't that right?

237
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,279
You're right. Isn't that going too far?

238
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,710
You guys are still wet behind the ears.

239
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:10,380
There are more to people...

240
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,079
than what meets the eye.

241
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,150
Among those lowlifes,

242
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,349
there's a corrupt cop who got fired...

243
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,190
for accepting bribery,

244
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,660
and another cop who's a gambler.

245
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:25,230
Isn't this just your speculation?

246
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:28,829
Then should I show you the evidence?

247
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:32,170
Will you believe me then?

248
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,339
Everyone, come here!

249
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,509
I'll show you something fun.

250
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,910
What... What is it?

251
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,079
- What's that?
- You can see, right?

252
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,690
What is all this?

253
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,089
Darn it.

254
00:20:57,829 --> 00:20:59,430

259
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,700
They went after the apprentices
with their weapons.

260
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,339
Can you believe me now?

261
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,269
Those lowlifes...

262
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,079
are going to betray the shaman...

263
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,109
and kill everyone in here!

264
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:54,420
Are we just going to stay still
and let them get us?

265
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,019
We shouldn't just let them be.

266
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:58,890
Let's go tell the shaman right now!

267
00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:01,990
She's right. If we don't chase them out,
we'll all die!

268
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:04,190
- You're right!
- We should kick them out!

269
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:06,500
- Yes we should!
- They're dangerous!

270
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,730
- We should chase them out!
- Inform the shaman!

271
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,789
You know it too.

272
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,220
I'm the only shaman
who's capable of serving you.

273
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:37,690
Why would you say that?

274
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:41,470
Why can't you be satisfied with just me?

275

00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,289
Ji Hye.

333
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,619
You have me.

334
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:43,460
I'll do whatever it takes
to protect you.

335
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,829
You'll do whatever it takes?

336
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,170
Please wait a little longer.

337
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,809
Do not be afraid.

338
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:08,049
I came to give you a present.

339
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:10,220
What are you up to now?

340
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,289
You want it to be gone, don't you?

341
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,160
The black smoke that's inside your wife.

342
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,630
How do you know about that?

343
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,400
Go to Dermatology.

344
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,869
And get rid of what they're looking for.

345
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:32,380
Then I'll tell you
how to save your wife.

346
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:36,579
Make the right choice.

347
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,619
You said it yourself...

348
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,779
that you'll do whatever it takes.

349
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,059
I'm so sorry.

350
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:58,029
I had to save Ji Hye.
I had no other choice.

351
00:29:59,369 --> 00:30:01,099
I'm so sorry, everyone.

352
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,670
This is all your fault.

353
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,079
Everyone is going to die because of you!

354
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:07,980
Stop.

355
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,650
Everyone is destined
to be sacrificed anyway.

356
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:12,619
No!

357
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,349
Let him go.

358
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,319
Do Yoon.

359
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,660
Kid.

360
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:25,829
Then will you replace...

361
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:33,869
Tell me! Tell me what I should do
to save Ji Hye!

362
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,039
Tell me now!

363
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,180
(Dermatology)

364
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,980
Come on.

365
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,519
(Dermatology)

366
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,859
Please don't tell Ji Hye about this.

367
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,400
We need to talk.

368
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:16,670
Do Yoon.

369
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,740
Why did you do that?

370
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,950
I'm sorry.

371
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:27,279
I did it to protect you.

372
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,789
And if Him Chan loses
both his mom and dad,

373
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:33,490
it'd be really sad.

374
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,799
Never...

375
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,470
Never do such a thing again.
Do you understand?

376
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,880
Do you understand?

377
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:10,430
Dong Rim.

378
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:45,519
No. Please, don't.

379
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:48,159
Please let me stay with Him Chan.

380
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:50,159
Please.

381
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,760
Calm down.

382
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:57,000
Don't be afraid.

383
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:01,940
You can overcome it.

384
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,139
What?

385
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,639
Just hang in there.

386
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,050
Okay.

387
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,750
Ji Hye.

388
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,329
Hyun Ho.

389
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,340
Is Ji Hye okay?

390
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,440
Yes, I think she's trying
to fight it off.

391
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,039
Good for her.

392
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,820
But we don't know when she'll change.
So we should keep an eye on her.

393
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,250
Right.

394
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:07,400
Where is Mr. Choi?

395
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:08,969
Well, I haven't seen him in a while.

396
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:12,340
He followed after Dong Rim a while ago.

397
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:16,110
Mr. Choi is in danger.

398
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,550
Stay here and keep them safe.

399
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:22,920
Okay.

400
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,989
I said I didn't!

401
00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:03,090
I didn't kill him!

402
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:32,420
Those who lied
and those who remained silent.

403
00:37:32,489 --> 00:37:33,789
They're all the same.

404
00:37:37,329 --> 00:37:38,929
Dong Rim, you should stop now.

405
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:42,670
You were the only one I trusted.

406
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:44,469
But...

407
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,670
you did nothing when you knew
your father killed my father.

408
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:54,039
I didn't have the courage.

409
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,409
The courage to keep you safe...

410
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,179
and the courage to protect myself.

411
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:03,190
You're a hypocrite.

412
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,659
People in this town...

413
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,530
are all hypocrites.

414
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,570
Dong Rim, I'm so sorry.

415
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:21,840
I was...

416
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,389
I'm sorry.

417
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,170
You all saw those punks
following the apprentice in the video.

418
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:55,940
If we don't do anything,
we'll end up like him too.

419
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:57,869
What are you suggesting we do?

420
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,409
What am I suggesting?

421
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:02,679
How could you not know
after seeing what happened to him?

422
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,380
We have to kick them out.

423
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,219
Otherwise, we'll be attacked too.

424
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:11,650
So we should settle the matter.

425
00:39:12,989 --> 00:39:16,530
But they have two police officers.

426
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,760
How can we even fight against them?

427
00:39:18,829 --> 00:39:22,570
My goodness.
You're making me frustrated.

428
00:39:23,769 --> 00:39:25,099
Listen.

429
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,409
Count how many people there are.

430
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:32,639
We outnumber them.

431
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,639
Numbers do win a battle.

432
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,650
More importantly,

433
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,920
we have the shaman with us.

434
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,789
- He's right.
- Yes, certainly.

435
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,090
Yes, he's right.

436
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,929
We can't give them any more time.
We should start moving.

437
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:54,030
Everyone, go grab something
that can be used as a weapon.

438
00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:56,730
- Right. Let's go.
- Let's go find something.

439
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,800
- Gosh, I should go too.
- Yes, let's go.

440
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,750
I told you
I won't let you get away with it.

441
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:17,289
You messed with the wrong guy,
Yoo Tae Han.

442
00:40:18,989 --> 00:40:21,690
Maybe they're going to
break into the intensive care unit.

443
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,530
Gosh, what do we do? Mr. Choi is there.
The pregnant woman and the baby too.

444
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,159
Why should we help them?
They're all in it together.

445
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:31,130
They seemed suspicious
since we were at the supermarket.

446
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:34,500
But the detective helped us
since we were at the school.

447
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:36,369
Can't you see?

448
00:40:36,469 --> 00:40:38,710
The detective didn't help for us.

449
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,239
She did it for herself.

450
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,909
If you don't want to put yourself
in danger, think wisely.

451
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,250
What are you doing?

452
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,690
I told you not to touch her
without my permission.

453
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:30,130
I was only trying to protect you.

454
00:41:30,289 --> 00:41:32,800
Do you think
I don't know your intention?

455
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:36,730
Why are you doing this to me?

456
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:40,440
She was trying to kill you by
taking advantage of your weakness.

457
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,309
How dare you? Are you doubting me?

458
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:47,110
No. I wasn't doubting...

459
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:50,610
Silence! You useless witch.

460
00:41:51,579 --> 00:41:52,719
It's...

461
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:55,349
over for you.

462
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,920
No.

463
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,090
Please, don't abandon me.

464
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:08,199
I heard she was losing her divine power.
I guess they were right.

465
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,130
Do you think we can get our money back?

466
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:12,539
Of course. We spent a fortune on this.

467
00:42:14,269 --> 00:42:17,269
How dare you roll your eyes at me
when you've lost all your divine power?

468
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:20,210
Do you know how much money
I've lost because of you?

469
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,780
My goodness.

470
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,150
No. Don't leave me!

471
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,980
Don't leave me!

472
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,920
Don't go to her.

473
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:34,789
I'm the only one you have!

474
00:43:05,989 --> 00:43:07,489
I'll kill them.

475
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:11,659
I'll kill them all.

476
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,059
I'll kill them all.

477
00:43:41,489 --> 00:43:43,130
Is the shaman there?

478
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:44,329
No, she isn't.

479
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:48,329
Where did she go?

480
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,099
We need to hurry up and get these guys.

481
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,079
Go check it out.

482
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,480
Hurry up and go!

483
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:16,059
What is happening?

484
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:19,929
- Goodness!
- It's the infected!

485
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,300
(Pharmacy)

486
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,530
What are you writing down?

487
00:46:36,369 --> 00:46:38,369
I was writing my diary.

488
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:46,579
They keep tormenting me.

489
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,940
I want to kill them all.

490
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:50,510
This is Dong Rim's diary.

491
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,820
It feels like I'm slowly becoming
someone else.

492
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:58,449
It feels like I'm slowly disappearing,

493
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:01,690
and the being inside me is eating me up.

494
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:05,530
I decided to work with the monster...

495
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:09,360
and started taking revenge on the people
who ruined me and my family.

496
00:47:09,429 --> 00:47:12,829
I'm not afraid of killing people
who deserve death.

497
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,000
