12
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:12,379
The director told me...

13
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:17,420
that he'd become my family.

14
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,650
But he...

15
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,269
(Interrogation Room)

16
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,040
Are you sure you can get back on your own?

17
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,079
Where are you staying?

18
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,180
You can go to Sunflower Care Center
or a shelter.

19
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,719
- I called them, so...
- No.

20
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,189
I'm scared of care centers now.

21
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,390
Why would you talk like that
when she's trying to help you?

22
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,500
You can get back inside.
I'll take care of it.

23
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:15,810
- Follow me.
- Let go!

24
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,139
- I'm walking!
- Just come along!

25
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,379
Let go of me, you jerk!

26
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,879
Scumbags like you should rot in prison.

27
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:23,449
Let go! Let go of me!

28
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,930
Would you come to my place?

29
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:36,590
Sorry?

30
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,729
There's an extra room
where I keep my clothes.

31
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,900
It's a little tight,
but it should be okay.

32
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,039
Until you can find a home
where you feel safe,

33
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,169
you can stay with me.

34
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:49,310
Are you sure?

35
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:52,780
I'm a detective. I wouldn't scam you.

36
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,919
Keep this on.

37
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,530
What are you doing?

38
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,629
Your smell.

39
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,939
You smell really warm.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,710
Like family.

41
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,750
Thank you,

42
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:30,449

Hwa Seon.

47
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,379
Don't do this.

48
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,210
You've done so well until now.

49
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,419
You're going into that hole again.

50
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,990
Get out of there.

51
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,789
You can't go in too deep.

52
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,219
Don't do this. This isn't like you.

53
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:19,699
Hwa Seon... Please don't turn into them.

54
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,399
I'll never give up.

55
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:55,000
Is that all you got?

56
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:57,970
No.

57
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,569
Detective.

58
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:39,910
Where is Soo Yeon?

59
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:16,149
(Out of order, do not use)

60
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,279
Hold on tight.

61
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,910
Detective!

62
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,759
Did you see her?

63
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,470
Yes.

64
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,740
It's all over now.

65
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,810
I won't ever see Soo Yeon again.

66
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,449
I'm sure you won't.

67
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,620
You did well.

68
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,879
Wait.

69
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,320
Thank you.

70
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,389
I still don't know your name.

71
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,129
It's Yoo Tae Han.

72
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:50,200
I'm Lee Hwa Seon.

73
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,990
She's okay, right?

74
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,320
Yes, Doctor. Thank you so much...

75
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,059
for saving Ji Hye and Wriggly.

76
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,059
Have you decided on his name?

77
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:21,929
Yes, it's Him Chan.

78
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,399
That's a nice name.

79
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,509
Ma'am, are you uncomfortable?

80
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,940
Sorry?

81
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,309
No.

82
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:36,279
Call me right away
if you feel any discomfort.

83
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,649
Okay.

84
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,820
Get some rest.

85
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,950
Wait, Doctor.

86
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,860
Have you seen Officer Park?

87
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,330
Well, no. It was really hectic,
so I haven't seen him.

88
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,460
I'll ask around.

89
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:53,360
No, it's okay. I'll go look for him.

90
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,240
Ji Hye, wait here with Him Chan.

91
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,440
Okay. I'm fine, you can go.

92
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:05,279
Let's go.

93
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:19,190
(Police)

94
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,399
Excuse me!

95
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:28,470
I need to use the toilet.

96
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,470
Just take care of it on your own.

97
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,110
Come on, guys. It's basic human rights.

98
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:38,509
I'm not talking about taking a pee.
Come on, please.

99
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,879
He wants to take a dump. What do we do?

100
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,220
What if we end up cleaning up his mess?

101
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,379
What an annoying jerk.

102
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,490
- You should do it.
- No, you do it!

103
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:50,450
He might dump in his pants. Hurry.

104
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,990
I really need to go.

105
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:53,759
I'm about to dump in my pants. Come on.

106
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,389
- Why didn't you tell us earlier?
- It'll only take a second.

107
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,730
I'll make it fast.

108
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,399
Gosh, I really need to go.

109
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,769
My goodness.

110
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,340
Finish it in five minutes. Got it?

111
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,980
Hey, what was that? What happened?

112
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,250
I'm Officer Park.

113
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:17,179
I'm Park Soon Il
and I'm the master of head-butting.

114
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:20,990
(World Heart Day)

115
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,690
(Staff Only)

116
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,100
- Officer Park.
- Oh my goodness.

117
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:32,860
You startled me.

118
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,399
Where have you been?

119
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,830
- Wait. Officer Park.
- Yes.

120
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:38,039
- Are you okay?
- What?

121
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,740
Your forehead is bleeding.

122
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,639
It doesn't hurt.
It's someone else's blood.

123
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,940
We have to get out of here.

124
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,580
- What's going on?
- Hyun Ho, listen to me carefully.

125
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,179
- People here are strange.
- What?

126
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,879
Everyone's crazy. They're all crazy.

127
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,950
What are you talking about?

128
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:54,389
Their shaman locked me in there
and barely made out.

129
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,190
These crazy people are
sacrificing people to their higher being.

130
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,289
What do you mean? Sacrifice people?

131
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,029
That's right, Hyun Ho. We have
a TRS radio in the patrol car, right?

132
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,559
Well, yes.

133
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,730
That's right. I'm sure military units
or police agencies in other cities...

134
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,240
will be able to hear our radio message.

135
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,340
But do you think there are
survivors in other cities?

136
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:15,639
We have to try something.

137
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,809
If we stay here, we'll all die.

138
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:20,779
But the patrol car is outside.

139
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,580
Wouldn't it be too dangerous?

140
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,379
Then are you going to let
your wife and kid die in here?

141
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,590
You have a kid to take care of now.

142
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,220
Let's go.

143
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:47,399
Those who do not believe me have died.

144
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,710
Those who do not believe me have died.

145
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:59,049
Excuse me, Shaman.

146
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,159
If I tell you what I've heard,

147
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,730
will I be chosen too?

148
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,610
(Police)

149
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:39,889
(Police)

150
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:46,600
- Why is the trunk open?
- What?

151
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,429
Wait. Where did it go?

152
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,470
The radio was right there.

153
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:55,570
Are you looking for this?

154
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,539
How dare you take that.

155
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:02,610
Hyun Ho,
we can't let them off the hook now.

156
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,820
That's right. This is your gun.

157
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,919
I was right, wasn't I?

158
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:14,059
Yes. You are chosen too.

159
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:16,559
Good for you.

160
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:18,700
Now you're chosen as well.

161
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,570
Shaman, where are you taking me?

162
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,870
You'll see.

163
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:28,970
What?

164
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,039
Why? Do you still not trust me?

165
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,610
Oh, no. Why wouldn't I trust you?

166
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:35,950
Get in.

167
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,980
You'll see your destiny as a chosen one.

168
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,870
I can meet the higher being now.
Right, Shaman?

169
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,570
I am chosen now, right?

170
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,450
Shaman. Shaman.

171
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:10,549
You said you wanted to be chosen.

172
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:12,779
So I chose you.

173
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,649
I chose to punish you
for what you've done.

174
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:21,990
How dare you roll your eyes at me
when you've lost all your divine power?

175
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,860
Do you know how much money
I've lost because of you?

176
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,629
My goodness.

177
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,600
- Did you hear that?
- Gosh, I can't believe it.

178
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,639
Die.

179
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:35,909
That's your punishment for confronting me.

180
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,580
You crazy witch.

181
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,210
Open. Open the door. Open the door!

182

Come on, open. Open the door.
Open the door right now!

Open the door! Open it! Open it!

184
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,379
The master is always behind me.

185
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,519
That's why you can't walk all over me.

186
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:31,330
Take some rest.

187
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:32,929
I'll take a look around.

188
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:34,259
Okay.

189
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,269
Detective, are you okay?

190
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,500
You're not hurt, are you?

191
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:43,870
I'm okay.

192
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,539
Oh, thank goodness.

193
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,580
Why did you come to the mart
instead of going to the hospital?

194
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,750
I was going to go to the hospital.

195
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,649
But I was worried about you
because you were on your own.

196
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:57,049
Besides, Do Yoon was tired too.

197
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,259
Thank you.

198
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,730

I saw you through the infected's eyes.

What?

207
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,049
It felt like I was

You'll see them soon.

- My gosh.
- What was that sound?

Save me.

- Save me.
- Hey!

220
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,839
What is he saying?

222
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:15,309
the foreigner outside,
I think he's completely lost it.

223

Sir, look at me. Hey.

224
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,319
We need to block the way,
or he might get in.

225
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,990
- We need to block the way.
- What is he saying?

226
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:27,619
I think he's saying we need to block
the way so that someone cannot get in.

What's this? Did he inhale the smoke?

I didn't do it on purpose.

I wanted to let you live.
I didn't plan to kill you!

There's nothing there,
so what's the fuss about?

Wouldn't there be a place
where we can shower here?

244

Should we look for it?

- I'll shower first!
- Then I'll go after you.

You should really go and take a rest.

Oh, yes.

249
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,950
She's a smart girl,

250
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:38,119
so I'm sure she's hiding somewhere safe.

What are you thinking about?

321
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,750
I told you that there's something else
in the smoke.

323

I saw it on the way here.

324
00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:21,460
I didn't see its entire body,

325
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,369
but it was a monster
with multiple tentacles.

326
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,239
I think that monster...

327
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:36,079
is controlling the black smoke
and the infected.

328

It could've killed me, but it didn't.

It just...

330
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:50,590
watched me.

331
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,400
I don't think it's a coincidence...

332
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,900
that I saw you through the eyes
of the infected.

It could be Dong Rim.

334
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,659
What are you doing?

335
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:27,960
What if it's the infected?

336
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:30,570
I left her a message
to come to Jingan Supermarket.

337
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:32,800
How are you sure it's her?

338
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:35,099
If it's the infected,
you'll get us all killed!

339
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:41,440
Please open the door! It's me, Dong Rim!

340
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,150
Is there anyone in there?

341
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:46,519
Help me!

342
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:52,960
Hold on.

343
00:35:58,829 --> 00:35:59,829
Dong Rim.

344
00:36:11,309 --> 00:36:13,210
Do you really not remember anything?

345
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,150
No.

346
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,980
After I left the bus,

347
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,989
I ran after the people I saw ahead of me.

348
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:28,590
And I think I saw the monster
in the black smoke.

349
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,530
But I don't remember anything after that.

350
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:41,269
I heard you were also
dragged off by the monster.

351
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,840
Is that true?

352
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,010
Well...

353
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,849
I was definitely dragged off,

354
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,679
but when I regained my consciousness,

355
00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:56,289
I was just lying on the ground.

356
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:02,760
Let's call it a day.
Both of them must be exhausted.

357
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:05,699
Okay.

358
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,929
All right. Please follow me.

359
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,519
I'm glad she's okay.

360
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,889
But how did they make it out?

361
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:55,539
I'm so glad you're back safely.

362
00:37:56,849 --> 00:37:58,650
Thank you, Detective.

363
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,320
Dong Rim.

364
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:09,329
There are just two of us here,

365
00:38:09,389 --> 00:38:11,090
so you can be honest with me.

366
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,960
Sorry?

367
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,030
If you inhaled...

368
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:19,070
the black smoke,

369
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:21,340
I can help you.

370
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:25,110
How?

371
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:28,340
You inhaled the smoke too,

372
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:31,309
but you couldn't do anything either.

373
00:38:36,289 --> 00:38:39,760
You knew I inhaled the smoke?

374
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,829
I saw you in the school hallway.

375
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,469
I'm going to kill you.

376
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:54,869
Lee Soo Yeon.

377
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,570
I'm going to kill you!

378
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:58,710
Hwa Seon!

379
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,179
What are you most afraid of?

380
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,320
Sorry?

381
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,150
After you inhale the smoke,

382
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:14,960
you see what you're afraid of the most.

383
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,059
Because of that, some kill themselves.

384
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,960
And some kill others out of anger.

385
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,869
That's what the infected are doing.

386
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:25,769
But...

387
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,739
How come you didn't turn
like the other infected?

388
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:39,679
There were many people
who didn't want me...

389
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,190
to turn.

390
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:46,719
Hwa Seon, please don't turn into them.

391
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,889
Detective, please be careful.

392
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,829
I will.

393
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,130
Be careful.

394
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:55,300
Hwa Seon.

395
00:39:55,869 --> 00:39:57,500
You've done so well until now.

396
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:04,210
I don't have anyone like that.

397
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:06,179
No one.

398
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,909
You have me.

399
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,210
Dong Rim.

400
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:14,579
I don't want you to turn.

401
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:22,090
I will help you. Do you understand?

402
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,230
Okay.

403
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,030
If I end up inhaling the smoke,

404
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:34,570
I'll do my best not to turn.

405
00:40:35,909 --> 00:40:38,010
I promise I will overcome it.

406
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,639
Like you did.

407
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,480
Good.

408
00:40:45,949 --> 00:40:47,449
Now go take a shower.

409
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:49,449
I'll go find some clothes for you.

410
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,809
No. No.

411
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,650
No.

412
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,000
No, no...

413
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,010
No...

414
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,989
You're not responsible for it.
You had no choice.

415
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,590
We had no choice. We had to live.

416
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:05,059
We just wanted his sin to die.
It's not like I pushed him.

417
00:42:05,329 --> 00:42:07,960
I did nothing wrong. Nothing wrong.

418
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:10,369
Why would I feel guilty? Why?

419
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:16,969
Don't. Don't come near me.

420
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:18,840
Don't...

421
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:26,119
I should kill him.

422
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,820
I should kill him.

423
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:30,789
I should kill him to survive.

424
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,289
(Muji Hospital)

425
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,329
I can take care of this.

426
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,500
(Muji Hospital)

427
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,039
That little jerk. I will kill you.

428
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,269
Hey, why are you doing this to me?

429
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:55,239
You little jerk,
I'll tear you up into pieces...

430
00:42:55,309 --> 00:42:57,250
Hey! Come on!

431
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:54,539
- Han Dong Rim, you give me the creeps.
- Yes, you're so annoying.

432
00:43:55,269 --> 00:43:56,940
Why? Do you have a problem?

433
00:43:57,909 --> 00:43:59,679
- What are you looking at?
- Stop staring.

434
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:02,340
- Hey, hey.
- Gosh, it's getting hot.

435
00:44:02,409 --> 00:44:03,849
Dong Rim, raise your head.

436
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:05,849
Raise your head
so that I can see your face.

437
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:07,019
Look at me.

438
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:00,429
What are you doing up here?

439
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:04,630
Oh, Hwa Seon.

440
00:46:07,969 --> 00:46:09,170
Have a seat.

441
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,480
What are you writing down?

442
00:46:16,909 --> 00:46:19,010
I was writing in my diary.

443
00:46:19,449 --> 00:46:20,619
Your diary?

444
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:25,289
It's my only hobby.
My classmates make fun of it though.

445
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,019
Do they make fun of you...

446
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,130
for keeping a diary?

447
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:36,269
It's because they hated me.

448
00:46:39,539 --> 00:46:41,369
Maybe...

449
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:44,510
I wanted the world to end.

450
00:46:45,909 --> 00:46:47,409
Because in this world,

451
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:50,909
there were so many people
who gave me a hard time.

452
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:52,780
Dong Rim.

453
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:56,219
I have a great business item.

454
00:46:56,519 --> 00:46:59,250
We can divide the money in half. Okay?

455
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,489
Get lost.

456
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:03,789
Just hop on when I say it nicely.

457
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,429
Don't provoke me.

458
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:09,969
Are you sure you don't want to do this?

459
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:14,139
My goodness. This is frustrating.

460
00:47:14,539 --> 00:47:17,139
All you have to do is walk into the motel.

461
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,309
We'll take care of everything else.

462
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:22,010
You're done talking, right?

463
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:24,480
Are you out of your mind?

464
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,679
Hey, do you want to die?

465
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,690
I'm bad, aren't I?

466
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:40,530
I know how you feel.

467
00:47:41,699 --> 00:47:43,469
Because I was like you too.

468
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:47,269
I thought about it a lot.

469
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:49,300
What?

470
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:54,440
I was after a serial killer...

471
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:56,849
who murdered my husband.

472
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:02,650
And when I caught her,

473
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:07,159
I wanted to kill her myself.

474
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:11,889
But why didn't you kill her?

475
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:20,139
Because someone I love the most told me...

476
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:23,570
You're going in the hole again.

477
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:28,539
Get out of there. Don't go in too deep.

478
00:48:29,309 --> 00:48:31,510
He told me not to...

479
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:35,519
fall into the cave in the back of my mind.

480
00:48:37,019 --> 00:48:39,349
If you go in too deep,

481
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,789
you will suddenly find yourself...

482
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:46,190
turning into a monster.

483
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,000
Hwa Seon.

484
00:48:49,329 --> 00:48:51,170
But if...

485
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:57,469
If I end up going deep into the cave,

486
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:01,409
will you...

487
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:04,980
get me out of there?

488
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,250
Of course, I will.

489
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,389
I will help you.

490
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,199
Are you feeling sick?

491
00:49:25,469 --> 00:49:26,570
It's nothing.

492
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:31,039
You went through a lot today,

493
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,840
so don't stay up too late.

494
00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:00,369
Here, it's time for snacks!

495
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,440
Again?

496
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,340
If you don't want to, then don't.

497
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:07,280
I got some drinks as well! Here you go.

498
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,010
Friend, this is not real chicken.

499
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:13,079
What?

500
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:16,150
I want some fried chicken.

501
00:50:16,789 --> 00:50:17,789
Fried chicken?

502
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,920
I want it deep-fried.

503
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:23,230
And when you take a bite
of the crispy chicken,

504
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,429
the spicy and salty flavor
will spread in your mouth.

505
00:50:27,099 --> 00:50:28,460
Dip it into cheddar cheese,

506
00:50:31,099 --> 00:50:33,300
and take another bite.

507
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:35,699
Take one bite, two bites,

508
00:50:35,769 --> 00:50:38,170
and lick the sauce on your fingers.

509
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:39,809
Isn't that how you eat it?

510
00:50:41,309 --> 00:50:43,349
Did you see his face? It's so realistic.

511
00:50:43,949 --> 00:50:46,980
Chang Hee, you can become a model
when you grow up. You're so good!

512
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,260
Ms. Na.

513
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:59,860
Mr. Choi, what brings you here?

514
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:05,130
Well... I would like to ask you something.

515
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,039
What is it?

516
00:51:08,139 --> 00:51:10,039
Dong Rim's father's car accident.

517
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:13,179
You know the truth behind that day, right?

518
00:51:14,309 --> 00:51:16,079
Why would you ask me that?

519
00:51:16,449 --> 00:51:19,250
I don't know anything, so go back.

520
00:51:20,949 --> 00:51:22,719
You were with them on that day!

521
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:25,190
Please tell the truth for Dong Rim.

522
00:51:27,659 --> 00:51:29,019
Who are you to say that?

523
00:51:29,789 --> 00:51:32,690
What's your relationship with Dong Rim
that you're doing this?

524
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,630
I just want to know the truth.

525
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,130
Go back quickly...

526
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,199
before I call the police.

527
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:41,940
Did the Chairman say if you keep quiet,

528
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,869
he'll make you a full-time teacher?

529
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:47,940
He's your father.

530
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,610
So if you're curious,
go ask him yourself...

531
00:51:50,849 --> 00:51:53,110
instead of coming to ask me like a coward.

532
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:29,920
Drink this.

533
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:36,460
Thank you.

534
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:43,500
It's a relief...

535
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,969
that they can rest for a short while.

536
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:50,739
You went through a lot
coming all the way here.

537
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:55,639
Rest well.

538
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,449
Where are you going?

539
00:52:58,949 --> 00:53:01,150
I'm going to the rooftop.

540
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,750
I'll check the surroundings
while I'm up there as well.

541
00:53:06,389 --> 00:53:07,860
I don't think I can sleep.

542
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,849
Doctor.

543
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,820
Have you seen my husband?

544
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:42,019
I think he went to find Officer Park.

545
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,530
He hasn't come back since then.

546
00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:50,900
I'm sure he'll come back soon.
Don't worry and go back to your room.

547
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:53,130
Okay.

548
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:27,039
What are you guys doing?

549
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,840
Do you know who I am?

550
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,739
Untie me right now!

551
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:32,239
This...

552
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,250
I don't think there's anywhere safe
except this place.

553
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:17,619
What should we do now?

554
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:30,300
Shaman, let's start now.

555
00:55:35,269 --> 00:55:36,269
Are you all right?

556
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:45,449
I saw the survivors.

557
00:55:47,619 --> 00:55:49,219
I think she's a shaman.

558
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,449
I saw you.

559
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,760
I saw her smear blood on a cop's forehead.

560
00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:00,300
What is this?

561
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:02,099
Soon Il.

562
00:56:03,099 --> 00:56:04,469
I need to go to the hospital.

563
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:07,440
I'll go with you.

564
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:11,309
No, you should stay here...

565
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:13,269
and protect the others.

566
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:50,380
I left a message
before coming to the supermarket.

567
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,849
Dong Rim will be able to find it, right?

568
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:30,820
(Day after the blackout)

569
00:57:32,389 --> 00:57:33,920
- What happened?
- She's a cardiovascular disease patient,

570
00:57:33,989 --> 00:57:35,519
but her pulse suddenly dropped.

571
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,860
Doctor, what's happening to my child?

572
00:57:38,929 --> 00:57:40,130
Please do something!

573
00:57:40,199 --> 00:57:42,300
My child will die at this rate!

574
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:45,769
Ma'am, please calm down. Ma'am.

575
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:47,869
- Bring a defibrillator!
- Yes.

576
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,340
Hyeon Ju, Hyeon Ju! Hyeon Ju!

577
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:57,880
Aren't you a doctor?

578
00:57:57,949 --> 00:58:01,079
Do something about it!

579
00:58:01,579 --> 00:58:04,489
Oh, no. Hyeon Ju!

580
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:07,590
Hyeon Ju!

581
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:13,699
Doctor.

582
00:58:15,929 --> 00:58:17,269
Please drink some water.

583
00:58:17,329 --> 00:58:19,030
You'll get completely drained like this.

584
00:58:22,099 --> 00:58:23,099
Thank you.

585
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,440
Cheer up.

586
00:58:31,809 --> 00:58:33,510
It's not easy.

587
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:36,320
We could've saved her...

588
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,550
if we transferred her
to a bigger hospital.

589
00:58:39,389 --> 00:58:40,860
But because of the smoke...

590
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:43,190
By the way,

591
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:46,730
I'm sorry for saying this,

592
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,900
but if we experimented with the smoke,

593
00:58:50,969 --> 00:58:53,199
wouldn't we be able to find a cure?

594
00:58:55,639 --> 00:58:57,739
What are you talking about?

595
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:00,840
We're stuck here because of the smoke,

596
00:59:00,909 --> 00:59:04,079
so there's nothing we can do
for the patients.

597
00:59:04,349 --> 00:59:06,210
If we have a cure,

598
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:08,980
we'll be able to help them.

599
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:12,190
You're a doctor, aren't you?

600
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,619
So do something!

601
00:59:15,389 --> 00:59:17,630
Doctor, are you okay?

602
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:20,900
You're a doctor,

603
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,869
so I thought you could try
doing something.

604
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:26,630
I shouldn't have brought it up. I'm sorry.

605
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:29,269
It's okay.

606
00:59:29,969 --> 00:59:32,309
I'll be fine, you can go.

607
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:35,079
Okay, Doctor.

608
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:06,769
I'm sorry.

609
01:00:15,619 --> 01:00:17,719
(All child actors underwent
psychological therapy while filming.)

610
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:37,809
(Dark Hole)

611
01:00:37,969 --> 01:00:39,769
You're going to save others
in the midst of all this?

612
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,039
That's nonsense!

613
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:43,880
People need you, Detective.

614
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:46,309
Dad...

615
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:49,449
Those who speak lies only see lies,

616
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:52,550
and those who speak the truth
only see the truth.

617
01:00:53,019 --> 01:00:56,659
You're only being controlled
by the monster.

618
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,789
Go and get them!

619
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:02,699
Maybe the monster is within us.
