00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,470
I thought it was sent
by the rescue team.

172
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:56,569
Anyway, good job surviving until now
when you're so young.

173
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,980
Did you...

174
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,650
see a young girl here?

175
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,049
Well...

176
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,019
The CCTV in the security room
is a blur...

177
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,359
so I can't tell if it's a boy or a girl,

178
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,390
but I did see a child.

179
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,559
- Security room.
- Tae Han, where are you?

180
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:23,930
We caught him.

181
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,869
I think he saw Do Yoon
in the security room's CCTV.

182
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,339
Where are you?

183
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,839
I'm in front of the machinery room.

184
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,140
I found Do Yoon's trace as well.

185
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,809
I'll go there now.

186
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,250
No, Tae Han.

187
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,950
You should check the CCTV.

188
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:40,819
You might be able to see Do Yoon
in there.

189
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,890
Then we'll be in the security room.

190
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,019
Be careful.

191
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,359
Okay.

192
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:53,859
(Machinery Room)

193
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,799
It's here.

194
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:09,000
Do Yoon! Come over here.

195
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:10,200
Hwa Seon!

196
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:16,769
Are you all right?

197
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:20,210
- Were you hurt?
- No.

198
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,490
Let's go.

199
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:36,759
Hurry up.

200
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:49,970
Do Yoon.

201
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,539
Do Yoon, are you okay?

202
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:05,619
Let's go.

203
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,839
Tae Han. I found Do Yoon.

204
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,680
Where are you now?

205
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,349
(Radial Tube Workroom)

206
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,019
I'm at the radial tube workroom.

207
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,519
How do I go to where you are?

208
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:39,259
There they are.

209
00:23:40,089 --> 00:23:42,529
- We found you.
- If they turn left, and turn right,

210
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,529
the emergency stairs to the third floor
are there.

211
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,430
Go to the left, and turn the corner.

212
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,200
You'll see an emergency exit.

213
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,039
(Restricted Area)

214
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:58,980
What was that?

215
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:02,849
What do we do now?

216
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:06,150
Hey! Tae Han!

217
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:12,660
Stay here.

218
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,089
You're going to come back, right?

219
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,529
I will come back.

220
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,730
Don't ever come out. Do you understand?

221
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:22,799
Yes.

222
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,599
1 times 2 is 2.

223
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,539
2 times 2 is 4.

224
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,009
3 times 2 is 6.

225
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,839
4 times 2 is 8.

226
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,880
5 times 2 is 10.

227
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,720
6 times 2 is 12.

228
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:47,519
7 times 2 is...

229
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:57,460
I'm right here!

230
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,240
Hwa Seon.

231
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:53,920
Where's Do Yoon?

232
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:56,589
She's hiding. This way.

233
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,029
Are you all right?

234
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,029
How can this be?

235
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:45,900
What did you do to Dong Rim?

236
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,440
She chose me.

237
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,140
You should accept me too.

238
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,980
You're the one I want.

239
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,480
Then I will let everyone else live.

240
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,980
You may have fooled the others,
but not me.

241
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,349
I know what you are!

242
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,819
Do you think you survived this long
because of your abilities?

243
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,319
Don't delude yourself.

244
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,490
I let you live.

245
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:15,730
Han Dong Rim!

246
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:28,140
Dong Rim.

247
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:31,109
I know you can hear me.

248
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,250
Dong Rim.

249
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,259
Get out of there.

250
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:44,730
Dong Rim!

251
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,460
Do Yoon.

252
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,329
Dong Rim, don't do it.

253
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:53,099
Please...

254
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:57,140
Please don't do this.

255
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,349
What about you?

256
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,589
I'm fine. Eat up.

257
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:13,390
My mom said...

258
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,960
if we share food, it means we're family.

259
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:18,500
Family?

260
00:29:19,829 --> 00:29:21,599
So let's eat together.

261
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,940
How come you didn't turn
like the other infected?

262
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:34,779
There were many people
who didn't want me...

263
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,450
to turn.

264
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:40,980
I don't have anyone like that.

265
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:42,289
You have me.

266
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:47,119
Dong Rim. I don't want you to turn.

267
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,890
I will help you.

268
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:50,630
Do you understand?

269
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:53,529
Just because you hate someone...

270
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,799
to the point of wanting to kill them,

271
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,569
it doesn't necessarily mean
you'll become a monster.

272
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,039
What do you think of me then?

273
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:08,549
I believe you'll be like her as well.

274
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,019
Thank you.

275
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:32,369
Are you okay?

276
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:49,650
Soon Il.

277
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,589
- Soon Il!
- Hang on.

278
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,599
Are you all okay?

279
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:09,339
What about the monster?

280
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:11,410
We barely made it out,

281
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,609
but I'm not sure how much longer
we can hold out.

282
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,849
We found Do Yoon,

283
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:18,309
so let's get back to the hospital
for now.

284
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:20,720
It will come for us again.

285
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:22,450
We must end it here.

286
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:23,619
Can you...

287
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,859
tell us where the liquid nitrogen is
in the plant?

288
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:31,359
There's one in Building 3,
but the doors are locked...

289
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,599
because the circuit breaker is tripped.

290
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,900
We need to go to the control room
to reset it.

291
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:39,769
- Where is that?
- 3rd floor of Building 2.

292
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,009
I'll go to the control room.

293
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:46,240
Then Officer Park and I will
go to Building 3.

294
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,109
Okay, let's go.

295
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,819
I'll be with the detective,

296
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,519
so call us if something happens.

297
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:01,019
But how will we lure the monster
to the liquid nitrogen?

298
00:32:01,089 --> 00:32:02,589
We don't need to.

299
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,599
It'll follow me anyway.

300
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:13,640
This is the control room key.

301
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:15,269
Be careful.

302
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,119
It's okay.

303
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,890
I'll be fine.

304
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:30,549
I know but...

305
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,960
Don't worry.

306
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,960
You trust me, right?

307
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,069
Yes.

308
00:32:44,869 --> 00:32:47,940
Stay at a safe place with him
and wait for me.

309
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:50,069
Let's go.

If you go straight,
you'll find Building 3.

- I will.

317

Try not to be a burden.

318
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,449
Mind your own business, and be careful.

319
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,420

I'm in the control room. Where are you?

00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,710
Tae Han, we were worried about you.

329

We've just arrived at Building 3.

Officer Park!

351
00:41:59,389 --> 00:42:01,590
Officer Park, where are you?

352
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,489
Detective, Detective.

353
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,400
Don't come here. Don't come here!

354
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:14,340
I'm fine! Run away!

355
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,710
Quickly!

356
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,440
I told you.

357
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:55,539
Others will die because of you.

358
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:03,820
Stop!

359
00:43:07,989 --> 00:43:09,059
Stop it.

360
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:13,199
I'm the one you want.

361
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:17,800
Let the others go.

362
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:24,239
You're giving up?

363
00:43:24,739 --> 00:43:26,809
Are you finally ready to accept me?

364
00:43:58,139 --> 00:43:59,210
Dong Rim?

365
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,480
Sir, wake up. Sir!

366
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:07,349

as the illness in the medical note.

from going bankrupt.

369

Stop lying!

370
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,059

and become a great person...

372

Are you sure you won't do this?

373
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:22,599
All you have to do
is walk into the motel.

374
00:44:22,659 --> 00:44:24,300
We'll take care of everything else.

375
00:44:24,369 --> 00:44:26,500
Raise your head
so that I can see your face.

376
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:27,570

Dong Rim.

379
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,400
You don't have to sacrifice yourself
because of me.

380
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,369
Others still need you.

381
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,070
Let's stop this and get out of here.

382
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:09,079
It's useless.

383
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:11,449
Don't give up.

384
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,219
I promised you that I'll get you
out of the cave if you fall into one.

385
00:45:17,389 --> 00:45:21,059
If I end up going deep into a cave,

386
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,320
will you...

387
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,059
get me out of there?

388
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,670
Of course, I will.

389
00:45:32,369 --> 00:45:33,739
I will help you.

390
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:42,079
If I had met you before the monster,

391
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:47,079
I wouldn't have turned out like this,
would I?

392
00:45:48,949 --> 00:45:50,320
It's not your fault.

393
00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:53,190
Nobody listened to you.

394
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,690
Thank you for understanding me.

395
00:45:57,989 --> 00:45:58,989
But...

396
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,369
I already killed so many people.

397
00:46:03,869 --> 00:46:07,000
Everything will end once I die.
That's the only way...

398
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,010
you...

399
00:46:11,239 --> 00:46:13,510
and the others can live.

400
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:18,710
What are you doing, you weakling?
Useless witch.

401
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,349
How dare you betray me?

402
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,889
Let Dong Rim go.

403
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:24,820
I'm the one you want!

404
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:28,989
Please don't torment the others.

405
00:46:29,929 --> 00:46:30,989
Please!

406
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:40,139
Dong Rim?

407
00:46:45,309 --> 00:46:46,679
What are you doing?

408
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:51,210
You don't have to put yourself
in danger.

409
00:46:56,289 --> 00:46:58,590
Even though it was late, I'm glad...

410
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,619
that I met you.

412
00:47:23,849 --> 00:47:24,809

413

Dong Rim.

414
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,300
No, Dong Rim will die as well.

415
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,380
Dong Rim.

416
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:36,849
Come out of there.

417
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,250
Please.

418
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,519
Come out of there.

419
00:48:45,429 --> 00:48:47,260
You're mine.

423
00:48:56,909 --> 00:49:00,079
I know it's hard. But...

424
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,380
let me go now.

425
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,719
I want to be freed
from this monster now.

426
00:49:10,019 --> 00:49:11,019
Please.

427

428
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,059

I couldn't save her.

No, you saved her...

My goodness. What a mess!

442
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:43,889
Ma'am. How come you're not done
cleaning up?

443

Your store is still a mess.

I stayed in Seoul
for quite a while because I was scared,

00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:51,000
so my store is the only one
that's still dirty.

446
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:52,369
I know.

447
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:55,369

Hi! It's Min Gyu and Ha Young...

452
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:07,079
You should call me Officer Park,
not "mister".

453
00:54:07,219 --> 00:54:09,219
Anyway, what are you guys doing here?

454
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,389
- We have a class near here.
- A class?

455
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:14,159
So you're studying now?

456
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,920
Of course. We're still students.

Okay. Study hard. Go on.

00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,139
Study hard.

462
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,039
- Let me help you.
- It's fine.

463
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,809
We should clean up fast.

464
00:54:30,869 --> 00:54:33,840

- Hi, Do Yoon.

When are you coming?

467
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:14,150
In about an hour.
I have to drop by somewhere first.

468
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:17,050
Get here fast, Hwa Seon!

469
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:19,820
Do Yoon couldn't sleep
because she was too excited to see you!

470
00:55:19,889 --> 00:55:21,519
Go away.

471
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:24,659
Get here fast, Hwa Seon.
I'll be waiting!

472
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:27,260
- Okay, see you later.
- Go away!

473
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:36,369
You. Why do you keep
telling her nonsense?

474
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,409

475
00:55:38,469 --> 00:55:39,869

Him Chan!

477
00:55:46,849 --> 00:55:50,219
Him Chan, who do you like better?
A handsome boy like me...

478
00:55:50,289 --> 00:55:53,019
or a nasty girl like her?

479
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:54,860
Stop being so childish.

480
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:58,329

Let's have lunch now.

Yes! It's lunchtime!

Yes.

496
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:45,070

starting over.
