(Chairman's Office)

12
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:08,640
Don't be standing there...

13
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:11,810
like a thief and just come in.

14
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,459
Mr. Choi. Take a seat.

15
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,900
Do you know what this is?

16
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,400
It's a handgun.

17
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:40,609
It's not just a handgun.

18
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:43,310
It's a medal of honor.

19
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:46,909
It was gifted by the President...

20
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,680
for serving the country for all my life.

21
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:56,519
Do you know how many people
suffered because of that handgun?

22
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,489
Suffered?

23
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,159
If I didn't catch those traitors,

24
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:08,370
the good world we're living in
would not exist!

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,639
Don't justify yourself.

26
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:14,370
The age of suppressing
people with power is over.

27
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:19,080
Listen to me carefully.

28
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:22,409
As long as I have
this medal of honor with me,

29
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,349
in this school,

30
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:27,990
my word is law and justice.

31
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:41,400
(Dark Hole)

32
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,439
It's Lee Soo Yeon. Soo Yeon is back.

33
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,710
I need to see it for myself
to be sure if Soo Yeon's back.

34
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,680
She even murdered my husband.
So how can I not care?

35
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,610
What's this? Is this a meteorite?

36
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,449
- What happened to your eyes?
- Go away!

37
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:58,349
I'll gouge your eyes out.

38
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,889
What did you see in the hole?

39
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,689
My friend's eyes changed black too,
and he acted strangely.

40
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,030
You must know something about it.

41
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,229
Why did you kill him?

42
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,599
I see things out of the blue.

43
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:14,569
Lee Soo Yeon. I saw the serial killer
who killed my husband.

44
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:15,770
Han Dong Rim!

45
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,370
Have you guys heard of a sinkhole?

46
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,000
Stop!

47
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,310
What's that?

48
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,449
Is something going on out there?

49
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:31,550
I'll gouge your eyes out.

50
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,150
Detective. I need your help.
I think something happened to my daughter.

51
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:38,719
The woman's eyes were black like his.

52
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,860
Do Yoon. Do Yoon! Jung Do Yoon!

53
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:44,830
- Mom!
- Just go now!

54
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,229
Mom!

55
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:52,270
- Young Sik.
- Are you going to hit me again?

56
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,240
If you hear this,
come to Muji High School.

57
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,909
There's a shelter.

58
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,520
If you hear this,
come to Muji High School.

59
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,919
Let's go into the school.

60
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:11,189
What could the sound
that only you can hear be?

61
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,020
I'm not sure yet,

62
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,560
but considering how the infected
suddenly stopped attacking,

63
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:17,730
I think they're being controlled
by something.

64
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:21,600
Excuse me. Open the door!

65
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:25,300
Where is the woman?
She inhaled black smoke too.

66
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,110
What if everyone here gets infected?

67
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:29,810
Stop pretending to be tough.

68
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,480
I know how scared you are.

69
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,079
- Wait a minute.
- Isn't that your wife?

70
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,379
How do we get there?

71
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:37,949
That ward is closed.

72
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:40,279
It's surrounded by the infected.
It's too dangerous.

73
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,420
I'll lead the way. The rest of you...

74
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,620
protect the lady.

75
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,730
Do you have any medicine for first aid?

76
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,230
Medicine that can treat a wound
this bad is in the infirmary.

77
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,899
I have a plan.

78
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,470
There's a way you can go to the infirmary
while avoiding the infected.

79
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,610
(Episode 5)

80
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,839
Hey.

81
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,079
Do you hear me?

82
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,250
What's this? Where is it coming from?

83
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,350
It's not from mine.

84
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,779
Yes, Detective.

85
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,220
I know it's hard to believe,

86
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,019
but I saw something in the smoke.

87
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,889
The black smoke isn't the end of it.

88
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:22,660
What do you mean
the black smoke isn't the end?

89
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:28,529
Inside the black smoke,
there's a being we do not know about.

90
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,019
Be careful.

91
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,649
Detective. Detective.

92
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,420
What detective? Who is it?

93
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,620
She's a detective from Seoul.

94
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,129
She clearly said there's something
inside the black smoke.

95
00:05:58,529 --> 00:05:59,529
What?

96
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:23,189
It's all done.

97
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,639
I'll be away only for a short while.
So stay here.

98
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:42,509
Hwa Seon.

99
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,339
My name is Jung Do Yoon
and I'm 8 years old.

100
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,050
I go to Gaehwa Elementary School,
a first-grader in class four.

101
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:52,319
You're coming back, right?

102
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
Yes.

103
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,560
I promise I'll be back,
so wait right here.

104
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,860
Okay.

105
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,870
Why did you join the activist group...

106
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,730
when you were so young?

107
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:51,879
You know the Pledge of Allegiance
to the Korean Flag, right?

108
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:54,310
If you can memorize it word for word,

109
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:55,750
I'll let you go.

110
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:57,379
How does that sound?

111
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,259
My goodness.
You're definitely not a patriot.

112
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,329
Here it goes.

113
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,699
I strongly pledge,
in front of the proud Korean flag,

114
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,029
allegiance to my fatherland,

115
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,870
to devote my body and soul...

116
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,069
to the eternal glory of the race.

117
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:26,939
Here we go.

118
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:30,279
My goodness.

119
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,750
Hey, this is what a true patriot is.

120
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:37,590
But it led us to become closer
and everything's been okay, right?

121
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,669
Doctor.

122
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,110
You're Kim Ok Bun's daughter, aren't you?

123
00:08:56,909 --> 00:08:58,909
How is my mother?

124
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,110
I've been taking good care of her.
Don't worry about her.

125
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,850
Doctor, may I see her just once?

126
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,019
Well, that's... Ma'am.

127
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:15,230
If we keep opening
the door of the isolated room,

128
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:16,490
the air pressure inside could change.

129
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,200
Then it could affect the treatment.

130
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,370
Avoiding contact as much as possible...

131
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,440
is good for the patient.

132
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,000
You do understand that, right?

133
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,710
Yes.

134
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:32,309
Then I'll trust you and do as you say.

135
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:33,379
All right.

136
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:36,250
Goodbye.

137
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,289
Everyone...

138
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,230
Every single person...

139
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,039
Detective.

140
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:49,389
We'll be okay now.

141
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:59,029
The black smoke isn't going to attack us.

142
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,500
It's just watching us.

143
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:02,570
The things that we have to watch out for,

144
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:05,799
might not just be the black smoke.

145
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:08,370
There's something else?

146
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,740
When the security guard was attacked,

147
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:15,779
I saw something.

148
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:21,820
It was something else
and it had some kind of a tentacle.

149
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,320
- What?
- You're all very brave.

150
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,990
But we don't have time for this.
We should hurry.

151
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:43,769
What is it?

152
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:47,909
Shaman, do you remember me?

153
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,149
I'm Bong Joo's mom
from Daebak Real Estate Office.

154
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,320
Go back. There's no use.

155
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:56,049
Excuse me?

156
00:11:56,889 --> 00:11:58,259
That person is already dead.

157
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,759
Oh, no. My goodness.

158
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:03,090
Oh, no. My mom.

159
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:05,799
What do I do with my poor mom?

160
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,700
Mom...

161
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,629
Your husband is dead.

162
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:12,840
What?

163
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,269
Why are you surprised?

164
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,940
It's a good thing that he's dead.

165
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,340
Wait.

166
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,679
What... What are you talking about?

167
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:25,120
You knew.

168
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,950
That he was having an affair.

169
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,419
That miserable jerk.

170
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:35,590
I've been through so much
because of that jerk.

171
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:37,600
He wanted a foreign-made car
so I bought one for him.

172
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:39,429
He wanted new golf clubs
so I bought them too.

173
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,669
I gave him everything he wanted.

174
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,370
But he had an affair?

175
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,100
That is why you should never trust people.

176
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,210
You must trust the higher being.

177
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:50,610
The higher being?

178
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,980
Look at that.

179
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,549
He is in there.

180
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:08,629
Let me see.

181
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:13,960
Is she that good?

182
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,669
- Just be quiet.
- Who is she?

183
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,139
She said the higher being is there.

184
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:46,529
- Hello, doctor.
- Hello.

185
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,440
I was too caught up with the situation
that I forgot to ask,

186
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,039
but which department are you from?

187
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,480
I don't think you're from
the emergency department.

188
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:02,649
I used to work at a hospital in Seoul...

189
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,750
and recently moved to
the internal medicine department here.

190
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,019
Thank you...

191
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,289
for not running away and staying behind...

192
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,789
when you must've felt
very scared yourself.

193
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,259
It's nothing.

194
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:20,629
The patients here need us.

195
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,169
- Rest well.
- Okay.

196
00:14:56,769 --> 00:14:58,669
Hey, what is it?

197
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,970
It feels as if something's following us.

198
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:05,539
Stop with your nonsense.
Who else would be here?

199
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,149
Hurry up, let's go.

200
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:24,899
- Officer, there, there!
- Where? Is it the infected?

201
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,399
Black smoke went into the vent just now.

202
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,769
- Really?
- Are you sure?

203
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,799
- Wear your masks now!
- I'm very sure.

204
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,240
I saw it clearly.

205
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,809
I should check it out.

206
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:43,149
Are you mad?
What if something happens to you?

207
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,220
If it really is the smoke,

208
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,049
it means it's actually following us.

209
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:55,090
- Soon Il.
- What.

210
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:56,559
Bend down.

211
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,659
- Me? Why?
- So I can get up there.

212
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,669
- I have a bad back.
- Then you go up there.

213
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,169
No, I think it's better for you to go up.

214
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,320
My goodness!

215
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:48,450
Watch out!

216
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,720
What happened?

217
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,150
The smoke...

218
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,319
went back into the vent.

219
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,430
What? How can smoke move on its own?

220
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,089
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

221
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:39,230
What the detective said over the radio
must be true.

222
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,069
It could've gotten in here, but it didn't.

223
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,970
Are you seriously planning to go out now?

224
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,210
I don't think it was trying to attack us.

225
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,880
Then what? It just wants to scare us?

226
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,009
That's it.

227
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,750
It's trying to scare us just like a hunt.

228
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,279
Darn it.

229
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:02,319
Are you suggesting that
the smoke is alive or something?

230
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:27,880
I don't think you realize,

231
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,079
but I'm the leader!

232
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,380
I'll take the lead, so get behind me!

233
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,549
(Did you still not get vaccinated
for pneumonia?)

234
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,910
(Administration)

235
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:06,250
Shaman.

236
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:08,089
What is it?

237
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,089
Please make a talisman for me.

238
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,890
You were right
about my husband cheating on me,

239
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,190
and you predicted the guy with
the baseball cap will die if he goes out,

240
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:19,259
which came true as well.

241
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:23,230
I'll just trust you from now on.

242
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:26,140
- Shaman, me too!
- Shaman, please help me too.

243
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,269
- Shaman, please.
- Get behind.

244
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:31,779
- I came here first.
- Line up.

245
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,950
Why are you standing?
It'll bring bad luck.

246
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:40,849
Pardon?

247
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,890
Get on your knees.

248
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,289
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

249
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,619
Shaman, please.

250
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:15,220
Shaman, thank you. Thank you so much!

251
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,450
This is the mark of the chosen.

252
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,089
Never wash it off.

253
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,589
Of course! I understand.

254
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:31,500
Thank you.

255
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,640
Thank you.

256
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,180
Darn it.

257
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,549
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

258
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:54,730
Do not fear death.

259
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:58,200
Those who believe will be saved.

260
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:04,640
Wait.

261
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:10,170
Not again.
I told you to stop ordering me around!

262
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,279
Stop it, you're being childish.

263
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,609
Stop it, Officer Park.

264
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,609
Go ahead.

265
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,049
Just be careful of the infected.

266
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,450
(The temperature is
being controlled for clinical purposes.)

267
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,990
(Please keep the door closed.)

268
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,099
The infected!

269
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,230
- Where?
- At the end of the corridor.

270
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,269
Let's move quietly.

271
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,839
Are you crazy?

272
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,579
We don't have time to take detours.

273
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,809
I renovated a closed school
into a shelter.

274
00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:00,250
I'm glad the kids like it.

275
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:03,990
What if they had grown
with love from their parents?

276
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:07,619
Then they wouldn't have gotten
involved in crime,

277
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:10,490
and they wouldn't have to live here.

278
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:17,630
You're saying that again.

279
00:23:18,769 --> 00:23:20,240
Look at yourself, Hwa Seon.

280
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:22,640
You made it this far
even without what others normally have.

281
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,640
That's because I had you.

282
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,079
Just like what we did for each other,

283
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:35,250
won't they be able to change
if we love and trust them?

284
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,720
Do you believe that people can change?

285
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:43,690
Yes, I do.

286
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:46,859
I changed after I met you.

287
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:50,829
Soo Yeon told me...

288
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:54,470
that you and I are the only family
she has now.

289
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:00,609
I still can't believe that
Soo Yeon did such a terrible thing.

290
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:05,150
I just wish she wasn't the murder suspect.

291
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:09,049
Are you okay?

292
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,130
I'm okay. It's nothing.

293
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,799
(Muji Hospital, 5th floor)

294
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:38,619
Hey.

295
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,990
She's not here.

296
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,059
Ji Hye is not here.

297
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,660
Security office. Come in, security office.

298
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:56,329
Answer me. Can't you hear me?

299
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,970
Darn it. Why didn't they stay there?

300
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,339
Where did they go?

301
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,710
I think they ran away from the infected.

302
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:05,740
(5th floor, Nurse Station, Surgical Ward)

303
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:07,579
(4th floor, Negative Pressure Room)

304
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,650
Negative pressure room?

305
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:10,049
Negative pressure room?

306
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:12,920
Isn't that a better place
to avoid the smoke?

307
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,849
It's connected right next to the exit.

308
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:17,549
Hyun Ho.

309
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,789
You need to calm down.

310
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:22,589
Let's go.

311
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:24,589
Wait.

312
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,700
Officer Park?

313
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,369
Officer Park, can you hear me?

314
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,839
Darn it.

315
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,319
Sir, let us in!

316
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,640
(Rescue Needed.
Survivors, come to Muji High School.)

317
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,250
Will you please pick up the signal?
Gosh, my back hurts.

318
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,849
Gosh!

319
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,720
What do you think you're doing?

320
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,750
It's not that, Chairman Choi.

321
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,619
Well, I have a slipped disc, so...

322
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,329
A slipped disc?

323
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,299
I have a doctor's note too.

324
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:06,430
Get him out of here.

325
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:08,029
Pardon?

326
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,369
Get these freeloaders out of here!

327
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,900
Are you out of your mind?

328
00:27:15,109 --> 00:27:17,470
The kids are scared.
Don't you think you're being too harsh?

329
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,940
If you're a chairman, then act like one.

330
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:24,609
- My gosh.
- Look at that.

331
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,519
Do you also want to get kicked out?

332
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,789
Tell me!

333
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:38,230
Do you want to get kicked out
with these freeloaders...

334
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:40,130
or will you keep your mouth shut...

335
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,470
and do as I say?

336
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,970
I... I didn't mean that.

337
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,710
Is that it?

338
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,750
I'm so sorry! I apologize.

339
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:01,789
I must've lost my mind for a second.

340
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,289
I'll do everything you say.

341
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:09,230
This is why order and control
are of primary importance...

343
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:24,069
You should stay in a safe place
with Dong Rim.

344
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:26,680
I'll come and get you...

345
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,809
once the path to the infirmary is clear.

346
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:45,799
Over here!

347
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,829
What are you doing? Open the door!

348
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:12,819
Dong Rim.

349
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,819
Are you okay?

350
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,420
What do you mean?

351
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,119
Well...

352
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:24,730
The infected might show up anytime.
Aren't you scared?

353
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,460
No.

354
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,500
I'm more scared of people
than the infected.

355
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:35,710
What's gotten into you these days?

356
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,880
You didn't talk to me like this.

357
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,309
Don't you know why?

358
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,289
Well...

359
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:52,119
Dong Rim, I...

360
00:30:56,829 --> 00:30:59,259
Why are you alone? Where is the detective?

361
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,000
Can't you tell?

362
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:04,400
I'm alone because the infected got to her.

363
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,900
Tell me the truth. What did you do to her?

364
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:08,839
Why? Do you think I killed her?

365
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,609
You little brat!

366
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:13,609
Just hit me. Go ahead and hit me!

367
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,680
Darn it. I can't believe
you actually hit me.

368
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,089
I shouldn't have listened
to a jerk like you.

What do you mean?

370
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,059
I think you and I are just the same.

371
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,190
Don't you think so?

372
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,970

373
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,829
What do you think you're doing?

374
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,869
We can't go back like this
when the detective sacrificed herself.

375
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,380
That crazy girl.

376
00:31:47,009 --> 00:31:49,250

Aren't you going after her?

Oh, no. No!

383
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,329
She's darn heavy.

384
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:58,630

388
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:20,159
Hey, where is the keycard?

389
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:26,760
Lady, have you seen the keycard?

390
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,110
Don't just sit there
and look for the keycard.

391
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:42,750
They said we need the keycard
to take the elevator.

392
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:49,019
- Excuse me?
- I mean the keycard.

393
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:51,119
Find the keycard if you don't want to die.

394
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:57,860
Did you say the fetus's name is Wriggly?

395
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:00,500
If you want Wriggly to be born,
find the keycard.

396
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,769
I... I don't know where it is.

397
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,900
Where on earth did they put it?

398
00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:16,679
What was that?

399
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,320

Hey.

403
00:37:55,909 --> 00:37:57,380
Is he alive?

404
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:04,050
Sir, where did the others go?

405
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:08,119
Well? Say something.

406
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,429

407
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,329

Just talk straight with me.

410

Officer Cho, calm down. Calm down.

411
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,739
Clam down.

412
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:25,909
I can't believe she's dead.

413
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:33,250

414

She's alive.

415
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,630
The pregnant lady. She's alive.

416
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:50,099
She took the elevator and went downstairs.

417
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:54,000
Thank goodness. She's alive.
Your wife is alive.

418

how long it will take to the highway?

00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:33,570
Okay.

500
00:50:37,539 --> 00:50:38,539
Get in.

501
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:45,880
(Haeoreum Hall)

502
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,079
Run.

503
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,119
Dong Rim!

504
00:50:58,690 --> 00:50:59,929
Get up.

505
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,369
Detective!

506
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:10,610
Are you hurt?

507
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,409
I can't walk.

508
00:51:13,739 --> 00:51:14,739
What about the medicine?

509
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,909
Jin Seok ran away with it.

510
00:51:19,449 --> 00:51:21,380
Get the medicine
and go to the main building first.

511
00:51:21,449 --> 00:51:23,190
I'll take Dong Rim with me.

512
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,190
- But...
- Hurry up!

513
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:30,530
Okay.

514
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,000
Do you think you can stand?

515
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,769
I'll try.

516
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:02,090
You should go first, Detective.
You'll be in danger too.

517
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:04,289
Don't give up. It's not over yet.

518
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,070
We must jump from here.

519
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,840
From up here?

520
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:21,739
(Haeoreum Hall)

521
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:25,010
There's no time to hesitate! Let's go!

522
00:52:51,909 --> 00:52:53,280
What building is that?

523
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,280
The gym.

524
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,349
You can't go
to the main building like this.

525
00:52:58,449 --> 00:52:59,849
Let's go to the gym.

526
00:54:14,059 --> 00:54:15,789
I'm sorry,
you got into this because of me.

527
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:19,059
Don't be ridiculous.

528
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:27,739
- Here. Drink it.
- Thanks.

529
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:38,579
(Painkiller)

530
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:15,280
Die! Just die!

531
00:55:40,309 --> 00:55:43,849
It's an emergency measure,
but it should help.

532
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:48,050
Aren't you scared, Detective?

533
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:53,019
Everyone runs away alone
to save themselves because they're scared.

534
00:55:57,889 --> 00:56:00,099
I'm also scared.

535
00:56:07,469 --> 00:56:08,599
How is it?

536
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,239
Thank you. It's much better than before.

537
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,280
It must be hard but hang in there.

538
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:21,480
Will the janitor be okay?

539
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:22,949
The medicine bag...

540
00:56:24,889 --> 00:56:26,920
I'm sure your teacher will find it.

541
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:29,920
So don't worry.

542
00:56:31,659 --> 00:56:33,559
My dad told me...

543
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:35,630
that people are the scariest.

544
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:38,369
I'm scared of the infected,

545
00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:40,769
but I'm more scared
of people like Jin Seok.

546
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:43,510
He only tries to save himself
in a situation like this.

547
00:56:44,869 --> 00:56:48,739
The bad guys will pay for what they did...

548
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:52,050
no matter how much the world changes.

549
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:55,420
Do you really think so?

550
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:02,059
My dad died in a hit-and-run accident.

551
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:04,429
But no one got punished for that.

552
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:06,900
It seems like...

553
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,559
only the victims pay the price.

554
00:57:31,389 --> 00:57:33,090
What? What is it?

555
00:57:33,289 --> 00:57:35,820
What are you going to check?

556
00:57:35,889 --> 00:57:37,190
Let's just keep going.

557
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:39,530
He just never listens.

558
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:47,039
I saw the serial killer
who killed my husband.

559
00:57:47,369 --> 00:57:49,739
She put a white cloth over his head...

560
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,239
and injected him in the neck.

561
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:02,219
I still can't believe
that Soo Yeon did such a terrible thing.

562
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:31,780
(Isolated Ward)

563
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,250
(Restricted Area)

564
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:40,420
What are you doing here?

565
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:44,130
Oh, the ER needs more saline.

566
00:58:44,829 --> 00:58:45,929
Oh, well...

567
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:49,500
Have you checked the large drawer
by the desk in the ER?

568
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:51,570
No, I haven't.

569
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:53,800
You should check there.
There's a lot in there.

570
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:55,199
Okay.

571
00:58:55,269 --> 00:58:57,840
Also...

572
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:00,409
Please restrain yourself
from entering this room...

573
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,780
without my permission.

574
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,579
Yes, Doctor.

575
00:59:13,989 --> 00:59:17,030
(Isolated Ward)

576
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:24,400
(Restricted Area)

577
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,659
(Dark Hole)

578
01:00:29,929 --> 01:00:31,800
Why are you going this far
to save some strangers?

579
01:00:31,869 --> 01:00:34,239
Would you leave them there...

580
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:35,639
if they were your parents or kids?

581
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:37,639
I can't leave them
when they're still alive.

582
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:39,210
Hey, have you lost your mind?

583
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:41,210
Yoo Tae Han doesn't know, does he?

584
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,239
That you got him fired.

585
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:47,380
Run! The infected are here!

586
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:51,420
Can't you see? This place is done for!

587
01:00:52,219 --> 01:00:54,659
- Hwa Seon.
- Lee Soo Yeon?
