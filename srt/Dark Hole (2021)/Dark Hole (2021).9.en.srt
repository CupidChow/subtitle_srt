12
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,840
Will you pick up my calls?

13
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:16,349
Hey, can you get off so she can get on?

14
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,950
What about me then?

15
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:21,719
You prick. This is a bus stop.
You can catch a bus.

16
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,390
- Darn, I didn't bring my card though.
- Get off!

17
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,599
Dong Rim. I have a great business item.

18
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:34,700
We can divide the money in half. Okay?

19
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:36,069
Get lost.

20
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:38,900
You should think carefully.

21
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,209
Your grandma's medicine fee
and other living expenses.

22
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:43,340
Will the government subsidies be enough?

23
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,879
You're basically the breadwinner.

24
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:48,079
Mind your own business.

25
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:54,290
Just hop on when I say it nicely.

26
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:56,150
Don't provoke me.

27
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:06,700
Get on.

28
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:12,000
We're off.

29
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:19,610
(Did you ask? Did she say she'll do it?)

30
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,379
(Give it some time, you punk.)

31
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,830
Are you sure you don't want to do this?

32
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,830
My goodness. This is frustrating.

33
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,069
All you have to do
is walk into the motel.

34
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:43,270
We'll take care of everything else.

35
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,669
Listen. You're not
doing anything physical.

36
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,310
You only need to
use your brains, got it?

37
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:56,050
You're done talking, right?

38
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,419
Are you out of your mind?

39
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,689
Hey, do you want to die?

40
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:04,090
How are you going to kill me?

41
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,990
- What?
- Fine. Go ahead and kill me.

42
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,530
This is great.
I've been wanting to die anyway.

43
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,300
Kill me! Go ahead!

44
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,699
Do whatever you want.
Push me off here or strangle me.

45
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:20,569
Wow, you're a total psycho.

46
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,979
I can never kill you
since you're my golden goose.

47
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:36,419
(Dark Hole)

48
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,090
The black smoke is not attacking us.
It's watching us.

49
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,960
So you must not trust people.

50
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,400
You should trust the higher being.

51
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,270
This is the mark of the chosen.

52
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,629
Run!

53
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:51,139
Do you think you can run from them?

54
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,500
Run! The infected are here!

55
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,169
Don't you get it?

56
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,110
This place is done for!

57
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,409
There's no time to hesitate! Let's go!

58
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,849
I saw the serial killer
who killed my husband.

59
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,389
She put a white cloth over his head...

60
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,960
and injected him in the neck.

61
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:20,430
What's wrong? Are you okay?

62
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,629
Hwa Seon.

63
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,040
You can't save anyone.

64
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,209
Lee Soo Yeon?

65
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,670
This is what the monster wants.

66
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,209
Everyone trembling in fear.

67
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,180
From the chaos, he will protect us.

68
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,779
- Please save us.
- Please, Shaman.

69
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,720
To end this situation,

70
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,319
we must reveal the monster's identity.

71
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,089
Yoo Tae Han doesn't know, does he?

72
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,589
That you got him fired.

73
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,730
Hwa Seon. When are you coming?

74
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,029
I've been waiting forever.

75
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,769
You're going to come, right?

76
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,040
Do you know why I killed Sung Beom?

77
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,810
Because only then, you'll fear me.

78
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,410
He was the most precious person
in my life.

79
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,149
(Out of order, do not use)

80
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,819
This is what you wanted, right?

81
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:17,319
Kill me!

82
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,040
(Episode 9)

83
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,670
What should we do now?

84
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,149
Shaman, let's start now.

85
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,089
Are you all right?

86
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,870
I saw the survivors.

87
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:07,769
I think she's a shaman.

88
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:11,009
I saw you.

89
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:18,920
I saw her smear blood
on a cop's forehead.

90
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,550
What is this?

91
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,319
Soon Il.

92
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:25,660
I need to go to the hospital.

93
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:28,730
I'll go with you.

94
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:34,329
No, you should stay here
and protect the others.

95
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,439
I left a message
before we came to the supermarket.

96
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,870
Dong Rim will see it, right?

97
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:19,910
(Dong Rim, come to Jingan Supermarket)

98
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,220
Dong Rim.

99
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,850
Is your leg all right?

100
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
We need to talk.

101
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,490
I have nothing to talk about.

102
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,860
I know you've had a hard time.

103
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,060
But you can't keep
your distance from me.

104
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,629
Who do you think
is responsible for that?

105
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:15,899
What?

106
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,500
Just think about what you've done.

107
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,339
I think you're
misunderstanding something.

108
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:24,810
I'm saying this
because I'm worried about you.

109
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,379
So don't avoid me and just tell me
why you're angry with me.

110
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,819
Do you really not know what you've done?

111
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:34,919
Dong Rim, that's...

112
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,149
I don't want to talk about it.

113
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,960
Don't pretend to be a good guy
after all this time.

114
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,190
And don't pretend
to be worried about me.

115
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,129
I hate cowards like you the most.

116
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:10,860
Where did the guy go?

117
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:14,629
He should've given us a ride
if he had a car.

118
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,960
So where did he run off to?

119
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,759
He had something urgent
to take care of, so he left.

120
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:21,870
How am I supposed to believe that?

121
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,970
We seemed like a burden to you two.

122
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,700
So you two decided to
have the car for yourselves, right?

123
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:37,009
You're confusing the others
so please stop.

124
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,250
Stop what?

125
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:41,190
It seemed like you two knew each other.

126
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,220
Why don't you tell us, Detective?

127
00:09:43,289 --> 00:09:45,059
Tell us what he's thinking.

128
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,330
That man...

129
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:54,029
went back to help his colleague
while risking everything.

130
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:55,970
That's all.

131
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,200
Help someone else
in the middle of all this?

132
00:09:58,269 --> 00:09:59,769
Does that make any sense to you?

133
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,210
The detective is right.

134
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,470
What's wrong with you?

135
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,009
Don't you remember what happened
before we came?

136
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,710
That's our music teacher!

137
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,679
Shouldn't we go help her?

138
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,879
Are you crazy?
The infected are right behind her!

139
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,220
Excuse me!

140
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:25,429
Teacher!

141
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,639
He helped Ms. Na not knowing who she is.

142
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:38,980
It's late.

143
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:40,850
Everyone, get some rest.

144
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:43,950
You kids should get some sleep too.

145
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,720
Just calm down.

146
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:54,889
You should take some rest too.

147
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,309
Everyone's sensitive
because they're anxious.

148
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,830
It's colder these days.

149
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:36,370
Thank you so much, Detective.

150
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:43,610
You're helping Do Yoon
and everyone else too.

151
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,809
You're trying to take care of
all of them.

152
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,809
Even at times like this.

153
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,450
Everyone's exhausted.

154
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,850
If it wasn't for you,

155
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,860
I wouldn't be able to
bring them here all by myself.

156
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,259
I don't think so.

157
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:08,899
These people need you, Detective.

158
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,240
I'll do my best to help you.

159
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:14,769
Thank you.

160
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,679
I'll go on a patrol now.

161
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,460
What's going on?

162
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:46,159
Didn't you see something pass by?

163
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,470
No, I didn't see anything.

164
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:12,759
Dong Rim.

165
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,700
Dong Rim, are you okay?

166
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
Dong Rim.

167
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,639
It's you. What did you do?

168
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,809
Why? Did you think I was dead?

169
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,419
That's all?

170
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,299
I'm different from you two.

171
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:24,659
Jin Seok is back and he's infected.

172
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:25,899
Everyone, run!

173
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,600
We have to get out of here. Hurry!

174
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:30,769
Gosh, Dong Rim. Are you okay?

175
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,070
What happened?

176
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:35,110
Jin Seok attacked Dong Rim.

177
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:41,909
Detective.

178
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,250
The infected are coming this way.

179
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,220
We should get out of here. Now!

180
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:53,159
Run away quickly. Right now!

181
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,690
- Come on.
- Hurry!

182
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,370
Stop right there!

183
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:10,940
Detective!

184
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,379
Hurry up and go!

185
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:18,980
You're no match for me now.

186
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:38,039
Get lost!

187
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:40,139
Move!

188
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,769
Take me with you!

189
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,840
Go somewhere else!

190
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:51,320
Just give up.

191
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:53,480
You're all done for.

192
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,649
You're the one who's done for!

193
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:27,150
Mr. Choi, what should we do now?

194
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,019
Come this way.

195
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,180
Are you all right?

196
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,220
Let's go to the hospital.

197
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:26,529
Mom?

198
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:30,029
Do Yoon, Do Yoon!

199
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,509
I'll go find Do Yoon,
take these people to somewhere safe.

200
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:40,710
- We'll be nearby.
- Okay.

201

206
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,109
Do Yoon?

207
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:17,180
Mom!

208
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,430
Do Yoon, Jung Do Yoon!

209
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,259
Do Yoon, I'm here!

210
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,970
Mom!

211
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:40,500
I'm here! I'll go to you, Do Yoon!

I'll go to you, Do Yoon!

213
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,980
Answer me, Do Yoon.

214

Do Yoon, Jung Do Yoon!

215

219
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,099
I'll go to you! Keep calling me
so I know where you are!

220

Hwa Seon!

Are you hurt?

222
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,539
Why did you do that?

223
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,779
I saw my mom.

224
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,750
What?

225
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:32,319
Don't do that again, okay?

226
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,359
Promise me.

227
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:40,299
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

228
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,700
Stay close to me.

229
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,299

Let's move quickly.

You're here.

233
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,890
Soon, that person will arrive.

234
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,730
It's her, right?

235
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,700
Why is that?

236
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:06,670
She does not obey you.
Why keep her alive?

237
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,039
You don't need to know.

238
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,640
Just do as I say.

239
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:22,289
But I'm the only person you chose.

240

Ma'am, shall I bring the offering?

241
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,329
Bring him to the fifth floor.

242
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,730
Yes, ma'am.

243

Pull yourself together, you punk!

247
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:26,720
It's okay.
If I headbutt them at the right time,

248
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:28,650
we can make it out of here.

249

Why do you look so surprised?

250
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,029
It's as if you saw a ghost.

251
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,039
What happened?

252
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:51,109
The shaman knew everything and saved me.

253
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:14,559
I told you.

254
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,769
You'll be the one to shed blood, not me.

255
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,970
If you want to live,
show your faith in me.

256

You're siding with that shaman?

258

Hey, what is all this?

263
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,289
Mr. Choi, what happened?

264
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:21,029
Maybe there is a psychic
in the hospital or something.

265
00:29:21,099 --> 00:29:22,599
What nonsense are you saying?

266
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:24,769
What are you doing?

267
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:28,039
It was like this at the school too.

Maybe they held exorcism.

- Your fault! Let go!
- What's wrong with you?

I'm innocent! It was him!

- Hurry up and bring him.
- Okay.

- Let's hurry and go.
- It's your fault!

the filthy beings from here.

00:38:41,289 --> 00:38:44,059
- We should run!
- Run! Go, go!

336
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,369
Gosh, I can't breathe.

337
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:52,639
You're all dead, you brats!

338
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:57,869
What do you think you're doing?

339
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:01,110
I told you to do as I say.

340
00:39:01,179 --> 00:39:02,510
I just...

341
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,920
wanted to offer sacrifices to you.

342
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,519
You foolish witch.

343
00:39:09,489 --> 00:39:11,519
I'm telling you the truth. I was...

344
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:15,760
Do you want to go back
to where you were?

345
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,530
Do you wish to be neglected by people?

346
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:36,449
I heard she was losing her divine power.
I guess they were right.

347
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:39,380
How dare you roll your eyes at me
when you've lost all your power?

348
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:46,659
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

349
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:50,030
I will never do it again.

350
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:54,230
So please don't abandon me.

351
00:39:54,429 --> 00:39:56,230
Please don't abandon me.

352
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,829
I'm nothing without you.

353
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,699
I can't live without you.

354
00:40:00,769 --> 00:40:02,869
Please. Please, I beg you.

355
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,840
Please don't abandon me. I was wrong.

356
00:40:05,909 --> 00:40:07,840
Come on. Let's go.

357
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,780
We should hurry.

358
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:14,150
Okay.

359
00:40:15,449 --> 00:40:16,949
My goodness. My leg.

360

- Gosh, it hurts.
- My goodness. What happened?

- We can't stop. Let's hurry.

Come on. Hurry.

363
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,309
- Block the door.
- Okay.

364
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,590
What's going on? What are you doing?

365
00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:51,550
It's dangerous. Get inside.

366
00:40:54,289 --> 00:40:55,489
Get in.

367
00:40:56,659 --> 00:40:58,429
Let's go inside.

(Intensive Care Unit)

369
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:05,500
Open the door.

370
00:41:06,269 --> 00:41:09,440
Open the door. We know you're in there.

371
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:12,780
We can't stay in here forever.
I'll go out.

372
00:41:12,909 --> 00:41:15,610
They have Officer Park's gun.

373
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:16,710
Hey.

374
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,989
If you don't open up,
we'll break the door.

375

- Open the...
- Gosh, it's opened.

376
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:39,199
Calm down.

377
00:41:40,269 --> 00:41:41,469
Why are you doing this?

378
00:41:41,539 --> 00:41:44,369
Why are you acting against the shaman?

379
00:41:45,909 --> 00:41:48,610
What did she do to you to make you...

380
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:50,480
Hey, don't move.

381
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,480
I know you're scared and confused.

382
00:41:54,449 --> 00:41:55,650
But you need to calm down.

383
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:57,650
I told you not to move.
I'll really shoot.

384
00:41:58,989 --> 00:42:00,289
Give it back!

385
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,460
- Gosh, no.
- My goodness.

386
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,690
Stop it.

387
00:42:07,429 --> 00:42:08,960
- Gosh, Shaman.
- Shaman.

388
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,409
My goodness, Shaman.

389
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:20,610
Everyone, step back.

390
00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:25,079
They are our guests.

391
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:28,679
Excuse me? Shaman, what do you mean...

392
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,389
Didn't you hear me?

393
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:33,289
I'm sorry.

What are your true intentions?

396
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:58,579
I only do what he tells me to do.

397

Everyone, go back.

398
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,159
- Go on.
- Let's just go.

399

- Come on.

(Restricted Area)

401
00:43:26,409 --> 00:43:29,449
What happened at the supermarket?

402
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:35,820
The infected attacked us
so we had to come here.

403
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:41,789
It's worse than you think.

404
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:44,829
They're acting crazy
like the shaman's controlling them.

405
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:46,760
Excuse me. How did it go?

406
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:50,699
The people in that room
are from the supermarket.

407
00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:51,869
We should help them.

408

Tae Han, we shouldn't stay here.
Let's get out of here.

There are kids too.

410
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:00,210
Those people are crazy.
We'll all die if we stay.

411
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,110
Getting out of here without a plan
could be more dangerous.

412
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:06,719
Wait a minute. Do you know this woman?
Who are you?

413
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:09,280
I'm from Seoul. A detective
of the Regional Investigation Unit.

414
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:12,820
Is there a safe place
where I can view the whole city?

415
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:16,530
The rooftop of the intensive care unit.

416
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,429
But you can't see the whole city.

417
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:24,199
Let's go there and take a look.

418
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,099
You two should go find something
to block the door.

419
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:30,840
If you're from
the Regional Investigation Unit,

420
00:44:30,909 --> 00:44:33,039
are you a senior officer?

421
00:44:37,449 --> 00:44:40,380
- I'm an inspector.
- Okay, ma'am.

422
00:44:40,449 --> 00:44:42,050
Is this my gun?

423
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:46,260
Doctor, please take care
of the people I brought here.

424
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,489
All right.

425
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:53,530
Can she order us around
just because she's an inspector?

426
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,300
So she is an inspector?

427
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,969
- Officer Park.
- What?

428
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,900
I'll go to Ji Hye for a while.

429
00:45:00,869 --> 00:45:02,199
Sure.

430
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:08,309

without any bullets? Gosh.

Ji Hye, who did this?

434

Hyun Ho, stop!

435
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:37,469
I tied this myself.

436
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,539
Why did you do this?

437
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:42,480
I'm so worried.

438
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:48,250
I'm not putting Him Chan into danger,
am I?

439
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,349
You're not.
Something like that will never happen.

440

Hyun Ho, I don't want to be infected.

441
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:01,300
Don't say that. You won't turn into one.

442
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:04,469
I'll make sure of it.

443
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:17,309
Don't come here, don't come here!

444
00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:21,179
Ji Hye, look at me! Ji Hye!

445
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:23,219
He's trying to come here!

446
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:50,110
Yes, Ji Hye. Please hang in there...

he had suffered from cerebral aneurysm.

- How can I trust you?
- Stop!

499
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,809
(Guardians, please do not touch
other places or other patients.)

500
00:50:51,389 --> 00:50:53,119
(Charity Bazaar)

501
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:57,659
It's strange in every way.

502
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:58,760
What is?

503
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:02,260
Why is she just leaving those brats be?

504
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,730
- You.
- My goodness.

505
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,070
Watch your mouth.

506
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,340
I'm sure the shaman has her reasons!

507
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:11,710
What was that?

508
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,579
Isn't it the security guard?

509
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:15,409
Stop talking and go check on him!

510
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,849
Why is it us again?

511
00:51:16,909 --> 00:51:19,550
You guys are the shaman's disciples!
Hurry up!

512
00:51:19,949 --> 00:51:22,480
- My gosh.
- Am I her disciple?

513
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,150
That guy...

514
00:51:24,219 --> 00:51:26,619
Run! You're so slow.

515
00:51:27,789 --> 00:51:28,920
What's happening?

516
00:51:29,789 --> 00:51:31,659
What was that sound? Hurry up.

517
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:34,260
- I think something happened to him.
- What was that?

518
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,900
It's here.

519
00:51:37,329 --> 00:51:39,769
I think there's something here.

520
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:42,969
Isn't that a person's legs?

521
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:44,110
Let's check it out.

522
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:48,139
Sir, are you okay?

523
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:50,849
Is he dead?

524
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:15,599
Detective.

525
00:52:18,269 --> 00:52:20,639
I think something happened
in the imaging center.

526
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:21,980
Let's go.

527
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:20,300
Goodness, why am I doing this alone?

528
00:54:20,829 --> 00:54:22,000
Come quickly!

529
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:24,300
Open the door.

530
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:31,070
The shaman sent us to pass some food
and blankets to you.

531
00:54:32,909 --> 00:54:34,280
Open the door!

532
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:37,650
What's this all of a sudden?

533
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,050
The shaman sent us.

534
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:43,219
She said you guys ran out of food.

535
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:50,559
No, they are doing us a favor...

536
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:52,989
so that they can offer us as sacrifices.

537
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:54,400
Right? Officer Cho?

538
00:54:54,829 --> 00:54:57,170
He's right, it's too dangerous.

539
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:03,909
But there are kids here.

540
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:07,440
And I need their help
with the patients here.

541
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:15,420
I think things have changed outside.
Let's go and see.

542
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:18,420
I told you. The shaman from the lobby
tried to kill us!

543
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,090
Officer Park.

544
00:55:21,659 --> 00:55:25,230
Then will you take responsibility
for everyone here?

545
00:55:32,699 --> 00:55:36,400
Fine. Then let's all go outside.

546
00:55:36,469 --> 00:55:39,269
That way, they won't be able to
hurt us. Come on. Let's go.

547
00:55:58,059 --> 00:56:01,030
(Emergency Room)

548
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:19,349
What happened?

549
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,750
(Emergency Room, Do Not Enter)

550
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:36,199
(Emergency Center)

551
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:50,849
Tae Han.

552
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:54,380
What happened?

553
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:55,980
Well, that's...

554
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:59,090
The ICU ran out of medicine and food.

555
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:02,360
They're offering us supplies,
so let's take them first.

556
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,869
You were causing all the fuss
to kill us a moment ago.

557
00:57:45,769 --> 00:57:47,300
What are you up to now?

558
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:53,010
We're welcoming you as our guest...

559
00:57:53,239 --> 00:57:56,039
only because he gave you
a chance to repent.

560
00:57:56,909 --> 00:57:59,309
So accept him before it's too late.

561
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,449
Then you can live.

562
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:12,329
Don't be ridiculous.

563
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:14,599
You're only...

564
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,769
being controlled by the monster.

565
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:20,769
That's not true.

566
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:26,469
I'm the only one
who's really chosen by him.

567
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:38,820
(All child actors underwent
psychological therapy while filming.)

568
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:05,449
(Dark Hole)

569
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:06,679
There's no point in running.

570
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:08,780
It's been following us all along.

571
00:59:08,849 --> 00:59:10,050
Don't lie!

572
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,150
What happened between you two?

573
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,559
You're a monster just like them.

574
00:59:14,619 --> 00:59:16,559
You'll be able to live
if you do as I say.

575
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:19,289
You're all being fooled by that shaman!

576
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,300
When we were attacked by the monster,

577
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,260
there was someone who was never with us.

578
00:59:27,369 --> 00:59:29,139
How dare you...
