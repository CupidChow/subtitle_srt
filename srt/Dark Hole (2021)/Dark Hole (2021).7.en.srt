It's quiet and beautiful.

Don't be too immersed in work.

15
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:22,719
You need to take breaks sometimes.

What are you thinking about?

17
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:39,799
I'm...

18

just so happy.

19

If I hadn't met you,

20
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,120
I would have never felt this.

21
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,420
Thank you.

22

Won't you answer me?

27
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,259
I can't even return this.

28
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:37,699
Don't return it.

29

- I'm going to kill you.
- You can't do anything.

47
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:14,629
- Lee Soo Yeon.
- Just give up.

Just give up!

54
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:43,660
Get out of there.
You can't go in too deep.

55
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,290
No.

56
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,459
I'll never give up.

57
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:08,509
I'm so relieved...

58
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,480
that you didn't turn into them.

59
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,810
It's the infected!
They're heading toward our bus!

About 10 minutes? Why do you ask?

75
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,560
Wouldn't it be safer
to get away from Muji...

76

- Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

- That won't help us right now.
- Please...

forgive me for being a sinner.

106

going to do with my stocks!

How dare you roll your eyes at me
when you've lost all your divine power?

114

Do you know how much money
I've lost because of you?

- Did you hear that?
- Gosh, I can't believe it.

Gosh, she's crazy.

- Lady, are you out of your mind?
- Just leave it.

Do you think the higher being
you believe in can save you?

120

Of course he can.

121
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:00,769
Then go out there.

122

- Everyone, step aside.
- Okay.

128
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,399
- What is she doing?
- I have no idea.

129
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,240

130

Everyone.

131
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,940
Don't listen to that shaman.
She's a crook.

132
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:41,450
She's a fake. A fake!

133
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,940
The ones who do not believe me will die.

134

The ones who do not believe me will die.

135
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,139
The ones who do not believe me...

136
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,440
- What was that?
- Did you see that?

137
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,970
- I can't believe it.
- My gosh.

138

My goodness.

139
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:46,009
Shaman, what happened?

140
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:50,649
The higher being told me
how to block the smoke.

141
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,179
My goodness. How do we do that?

142
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,659
We have to offer a sacrifice.

143
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:02,629
How dare you try to deceive everyone?

144
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,000
Hey, how can you say that
after seeing it with your own eyes?

145
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,169
How dare you talk to the shaman that way?

146
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,269
Everyone, we must keep our wits about us.

147
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,039
How on earth can she stop the black smoke?

148
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,940
- You know nothing about the shaman.
- How dare you say that?

149
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:19,009
Then...

150
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,509
how will you stop it?

151
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,549
Shaman, do you want us to grab her?

152
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:29,649
No.

153
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:32,779
Get ahold of yourself.

154
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,149
You had no choice.

155
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:37,289
You didn't kill that guy.

156
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:41,259
We went through a lot to catch this man.

157
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,200
- We finally got him.
- Yes, thank goodness.

158
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:46,600
- He should be arrested.
- You're right.

159
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,100
- He's a bad man.
- I know. Gosh.

160
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,000
- My goodness.
- Shaman.

161
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,970
The black smoke came back
because of this filthy man.

162
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:59,879
What are you talking about?
What did he do?

163
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,250
Isn't that the livestock farmer's watch?

164
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,090
Oh, you're right. It's Mr. Kang's.

165
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:12,289
He always bragged
about his handmade watch.

166
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:15,429
- What is he trying to say?

Are you okay?

335
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,510
Do you think you can get up?

336
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:06,929
Darn it. I was going to kill him.

337
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:27,019
She paralyzed my husband with a drug,

338
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:29,849
put a white cloth over his head,
and killed him.

339
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,460
It was you.

340
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,900
Detective.

341
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,510
Do you hear me?

342
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,869
Yes, I hear you.

343
00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:56,179
Lee Soo Yeon, the murderer
who you're looking for...

344
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,349
is with me right now.

345
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:04,250
Are you sure she's Lee Soo Yeon?

346
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:06,989
Yes, I'm sure of it.

347
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:10,230
I put handcuffs on her in the storage.

348
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:12,130
I'm at Jingan Mart...

349
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:16,670
Hello? Hey. Can you hear me?

350
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,179
You should've recharged the batteries.

351
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,449
You could just change the batteries
since we're at a supermarket.

352
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:34,719
Are you having fun?

353
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:36,619
Where is Jingan Mart?

354
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,059
It's close from here.
You should go that way.

355
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,590
But why do you ask?

356
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,389
I have to go there right away.

357
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,960
You take the people to the hospital.

358
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:48,300
It's important.

359
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:53,039
Did you smile like that
when you killed those people?

360
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:56,010
I kill better when I smile.

361
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,940
I guess it doesn't work for you.

362
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:02,039
By the way, is Young Sik still alive?

363
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,719
No, I'm sure he isn't.

364
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:13,420
What? Do you want to kill me?

365
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:20,260
Go with the teacher
and wait for me at the hospital, okay?

366
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:30,110
Mr. Choi, where is the detective going?

367
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:32,639
She said she'll stop by at Jingan Mart
and come to the hospital.

368
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:34,579
We should go on ahead to the hospital.

369
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:39,619
Mr. Choi, can we even reach the hospital
by ourselves?

370
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,920
She's right. We don't even have a gun.

371
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,349
The detective has a gun.

372
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,119
They're right.
We should go to Jingan Mart too.

373
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:48,659
It's closer than the hospital.

374
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,639
Mister, get me something to drink.

375
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,639
I'm thirsty.

376
00:40:02,909 --> 00:40:04,309
I can't believe you.

377
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:03,429
Hwa Seon must be having so much fun.

378
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:25,789
So was this it?

379
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:39,900
Hurry up. I'll be waiting for you.

380
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:18,539
Untie me. Come on, untie me.

381
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,750
I'm a police officer.

382
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:23,949
Hey.

383
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,510
Oh, Shaman.

384
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,489
Hey, untie me.

385
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:38,059
What do you think you're doing?

386
00:42:38,929 --> 00:42:40,730
You must be punished.

387
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,500
Why are you doing this?
I did nothing wrong.

388
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:47,039
- Yes, Shaman.
- Don't come near me.

389
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:48,469
What are you doing?

390
00:42:48,769 --> 00:42:50,639
No. Don't.

391
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:52,840
- No, not there.
- Darn it.

392
00:42:52,909 --> 00:42:54,079
Here it is.

393
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:59,050
The gangster.

394
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:01,949
You killed him.

395
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,789
No, no. It was an accident.

396
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:06,559
I didn't kill him.

397
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:08,559
Who do you think will believe you?

398
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,829
Yoo Tae Han.

399
00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:14,130
Do you think he'll believe you?

400
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,900
What do you want from me?

401
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,139
Fear.

402
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:26,679
Terror.

403
00:43:26,739 --> 00:43:29,750
Frustration, despair, agony,

404
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:31,550
and death.

405
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:36,090
You must be punished for your sin.

406
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:39,820
We'll use you as a sacrifice
to the higher being.

407
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:45,059
What do you mean?
Speak clearly so I can understand.

408
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:46,429
Stop pretending to be righteous.

409
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,500
- You're just...
- Hey, stop talking.

410
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:54,000
Shaman, do you think it'll be okay
to leave the officer like that?

411
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,639
Just wait. It isn't time yet.

412
00:43:58,409 --> 00:44:02,079
Keep an eye on him
until the higher being speaks to us.

413
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,409
Yes, Shaman.

414
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,820
(Jingan Mart)

415
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,579
Hwa Seon.

416
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:21,280
When are you coming?
I've been waiting forever.

417
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,320
You're going to come quickly, aren't you?

418
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,210
Darn it.

419
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,739
Gosh!

420
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,369
Help me!

421
00:47:50,539 --> 00:47:51,869
That's our music teacher!

422
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,780
Shouldn't we go help her?

423
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,639
Are you crazy?
The infected are right behind her!

424
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:56,880
Don't even think of going there.

425
00:47:58,349 --> 00:47:59,780
Go away!

426
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:03,750
Help me!

427
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,590
What are you doing?
Do you all want to die?

428
00:48:44,659 --> 00:48:45,659
Are you all right?

429
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:07,449
Hwa Seon, you're here.

430
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,460
Lee Soo Yeon.

431
00:49:18,389 --> 00:49:21,559
Why? Seeing me must remind you
of Sung Beom.

432
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:29,570
Hwa Seon.

433
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:44,889
(Jingan Mart)

434
00:50:00,099 --> 00:50:01,099
Excuse me!

435
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:08,440
(Jingan Mart)

436
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,280
Teacher!

437
00:50:20,889 --> 00:50:21,960
Are you okay?

438
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:27,760
Are you okay?

439
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:28,960
Gosh.

440
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:34,639
Wait.

441
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:38,440
Are you guys from the school?

442
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:39,510
Yes.

443
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:42,639
Are you the one who talked over the radio
with the detective?

444
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,980
Where's the detective?

445
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:50,550
I'm not sure.

446
00:50:52,989 --> 00:50:54,889
Hwa Seon's not in danger, right?

447
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,130
She went ahead of us.

448
00:50:58,929 --> 00:51:00,599
Please find her.

449
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,550
Do you know why I killed Sung Beom?

450
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:32,289
Because only then, you'll fear me.

451
00:52:32,989 --> 00:52:34,190
Isn't that right?

452
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:37,960
He...

453
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,630
was the most precious person in my life.

454
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,099
You're infected too?

455
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:26,739
Aren't you curious about
Sung Beom's last words?

456
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:28,210
Shut up!

457
00:53:30,349 --> 00:53:33,550
"Please don't kill me, Soo Yeon.
I want to live."

458
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,449
- Stop.
- "I promised Hwa Seon..."

459
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:39,050
"that I'll make her happy
for the rest of her life."

460
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:55,269
This is what you wanted, right?

461
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,639
Kill me!

462
00:53:56,909 --> 00:53:58,369
You're crazy.

463
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:02,280
So why did you sympathize with me...

464
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:05,550
and look at me as if you'll protect me?

465
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,880
How can you kill someone
just because of that?

466
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:12,619
So why did you try to change me?

467
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:32,110
Hwa Seon.

468
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,449
Don't do this.

469
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,280
You've done so well until now.

470
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:46,449
You're going into that hole again.

471
00:54:46,789 --> 00:54:47,960
Get out of there.

472
00:54:48,219 --> 00:54:49,789
You can't go in too deep.

473
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:51,530
Don't do this.

474
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,400
This isn't like you.

475
00:54:56,929 --> 00:54:58,070
Hwa Seon...

476
00:54:58,699 --> 00:55:00,769
Please don't turn into them.

477
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:06,570
I'll never give up.

478
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,940
Is that all you got?

479
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:26,719
I'll do it.

480
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,230
Are you hurt?

481
00:56:41,469 --> 00:56:42,699
Can I...

482
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:46,809
take the scissors?

483
00:57:14,869 --> 00:57:16,269
Don't worry.

484
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:19,139
It's all over now.

485
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:21,710
Is it really?

486
00:57:23,949 --> 00:57:26,550
Yes, it's all over.

487
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:48,070
Soo Yeon told me that...

488
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:51,269
you and I are the only family she has now.

489
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,579
Hwa Seon.

490
00:57:55,079 --> 00:57:57,980
I still can't believe that Soo Yeon did...

491
00:57:59,179 --> 00:58:00,550
such a terrible thing.

492
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:07,559
I just wish she wasn't the murder suspect.

493
00:58:09,019 --> 00:58:11,860
Hwa Seon... Don't come.

494
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:14,860
(Oh, right! You want to know
why I killed Sung Beom, right?)

495
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,800
(It's because you two thought
you could change me.)

496
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,070
(That really made me sick.)

497
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:20,539
(That's why I killed him.
Isn't it awesome?)

498
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:21,400
(Laughter)

499
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:23,639
(Hwa Seon)

500
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,250
(All child actors underwent
psychological therapy while filming.)

501
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,409
(Dark Hole)

502
00:58:57,570 --> 00:58:59,139
Why on earth are you doing this?

503
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:01,909
Were you behind
everything that happened so far?

504
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:03,610
You said you wanted to be chosen.

505
00:59:03,849 --> 00:59:05,650
So I chose you.

506
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:07,050
Get ready to greet a guest.

507
00:59:07,849 --> 00:59:10,119
I saw you through the eyes
of the infected.

508
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:13,320
It felt as if I was connected to them.

509
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:16,159
If I fall into a deep cave,

510
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,389
will you be able to get me out?

511
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:21,230
I think that monster
is controlling the infected.

512
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,460
Hwa Seon!
