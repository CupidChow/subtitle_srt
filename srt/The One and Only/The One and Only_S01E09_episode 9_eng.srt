1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,660

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:11,020
 Kang Se Yeon, an ordinary housewife.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,990
 The DNA of Kang Se Yeon's husband, Oh Young Chan,

4
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,010
 was found on the golf club used as the murder weapon.

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,220
 She is in the process of filing for a divorce.

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,200
 Sung Mi Do, famous influencer.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,080
 "Would it be a crime if I took only one bad guy with me while I'm dying?"

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,950
 After posting this on her page, it was immediately deleted.

9
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,990
 Expected to marry LE Group Director, Koo Ji Pyo.

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,900
 Pyo In Sook, a skin scrubber. The suspect, Ha Yong Geun's, neighbor.

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,730
 The main character related to the entire case.

12
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:50,350
 In a relationship with Min Woo Cheon, who was the main suspect.

13
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,360
It's a trap.

14
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,500
 These three women are at Morning Sunlight Hospice.

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,900

16
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,390
No, we cannot conclude yet that it's a serial murder.

17
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,950
Do you think it's a copycat crime?

18
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,600
We lack the evidence to reach any definitive conclusions.

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,690
The first victim, Ha Yong Geun, and the second victim, Park Doo Jin,

20
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,440
share in common the fact that they perpetrated cases of child sexual violence.

21
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,120
On top of that, the moss rose is there as a signal in both cases.

22
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,000
Hasn't there been no progress made on the first murder case yet?

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,490
The criticism of the police's ineptitude, and the wild support

24
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,110
- for the Rose Moss Serial Killer– 
 - Since we're out of time, I will be stopping here.

25
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,740
 Team Leader, please wait a minute!

26
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,740
 Park Doo Jin, who was released after serving 13 years in prison on the charge of child sexual abuse,

27
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,180
 has been found dead.

28
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:50,210
It leaves me speechless thinking how he ruined a child's life and was planning to live off of welfare benefits.

29
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,280
Since he died like that, and it's not really right to say this, but

30
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,660
it's quite refreshing, to be honest.

31
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,140
Good thing he died. He deserved it.

32
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,660
A woman who is getting divorced prior to dying.

33
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,570
A woman who is going to get married, and a woman in love.

34
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,690
What's going on here?

35
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,160
These are the violent crime detectives that have been dispatched to the regional investigation unit as of today.

36
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,310
Greet each other gradually. You will need more manpower for investigation, now that this has become a serial murder case.

37
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:28,500
- Excuse me? 
 - Weren't these three women near the scene of Park Doo Jin's murder?

38
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,510
- And Jo Si Yeong is on his way there? 
 - Yes.

39
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,240
- But to judge so simply– 
 - Simply?

40
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,680
- Simply? 
 - We should make judgments

41
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,960
following an examination of the crime scene inspection's results.

42
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,590
For the culprit to reveal their path of movement while committing a serial murder

43
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,450
and being at the crime scene is just...

44
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,330
Don't think of criminals as being impressively calculative.

45
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,430
That girl that is getting married said herself,

46
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:56,170
"Would it be a crime to take one bad guy with me while I'm dying?"

47
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,100
So the three of them went.

48
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,860
But at that time, a hitman, who received a commission,

49
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,180
came and labored in vain.

50
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,710
At any rate, people were so happy after they killed that guy.

51
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:14,140
They were raving! You know how serial killers go crazy for that kind of thing.

52
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,380
"Oh, really? Let's kill more!"

53
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,960
An even worse guy, Park Doo Jin. It's quite simple.

54
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,560
That hasn't been proven.

55
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,690
Only because we couldn't yet.

56
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,500
Mess them up. Mess them up and get it out of them. Those three women

57
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,420
and Min Woo Cheon.

58
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,840
 This is an abuse of power!

59
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,310
 Abuse of power! Abuse of power!

60
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,120
We are not criminals!

61
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,220
 We are not! We are not! We are not!

62
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,860
Please be quiet.

63
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,760
Why are you riding this back?

64
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,330
Are you supervising us right now?

65
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,820
You'll know once we get there.

66
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,640
- We are dying! 
  - We are dying! We are dying!

67
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,540
 It's a trap.

68
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,410
When you said "trap,"

69
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,010
what did you mean?

70
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,020
Don't say anything for now. We need to buy time.

71
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,360
We could be framed for a second murder.

72
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,500

73
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,300

74
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:48,900

75
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,440
 It's all over. Things are going to get worse.

76
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,100
 I'm saying this one last time for your benefit, so listen up.

77
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,980
 Don't fight a fight that you can't win, hurry up and get out of it.

78
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,630
 Don't play around with the phone. Think about your family.

79
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,740
 - Please hurry on inside! 
 - Be careful.

80
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,840
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Please hurry inside!

81
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,390
Head in. Hurry, hurry!

82
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,730
I'm sorry! Yes, yes! Hurry up and get inside.

83
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,530
Gather.

84
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,160
- Okay, listen up. 
 - Excuse me.

85
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,850
Yes?

86
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,990
- You're being rude. 
 - Veronica, stop it.

87
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,960
Wait a second! They're being too mean!

88
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,470
I don't think you have the right to order around the patients. It's not like they're prisoners.

89
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,850
Yes, that's true.

90
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,680
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,230
How rude.

92
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,630
What is it? What's going on?

93
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:23,080
You– Why are you over there?

94
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,220
What happened?

95
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,780
We are in the middle of investigating Ha Yong Geun's murder case.

96
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,830
Yeah, you've been doing that since before.

97
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,380
But why are you doing it here? Who are you investigating?

98
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,620
You? Why are you over there?

99
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,680
Do you happen to know In Sook?

100
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,590
Wait.

101
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:52,090
So that day, you weren't just passing by...

102
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,180
Grandma, let's go in first. I'll explain everything later.

103
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:00,750
What I'm saying is, that day... so... it's like...

104
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,910
Eat.

105
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:10,600
It's time to eat! You have to eat something.

106
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,890
I'll cook something up in no time, so rest up.

107
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:17,220
Come and eat!

108
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,850
You can't just roughly chop it up like that.

109
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,530
You have to slice it diagonally.

110
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,490
Just hurry and slice.

111
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,210
All of those people are waiting, even the police are over there.

112
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,230
I have to bewitch them with flavor.

113
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,030
No, wait–

114
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,860
No! The water hasn't even started boiling!

115
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,940
The timing isn't right.

116
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,870
This is food for the patients! 
   (She added MSG, flavor enhancer)

117
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,290
I just put in a little.

118
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:33,870
Wait!  Why is that coming out of your pocket...

119
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,450
I only put in a little bit.

120
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,400
This isn't the time to be eating...

121
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,560
My goodness, eat up.

122
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,070
You have to eat in order to live. Eat up.

123
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:59,060
But where did the handsome detective go?

124
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:03,780
Oh, that guy doesn't eat well with others.

125
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,270
- Why? 
 - Something about him losing his appetite.

126
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,120
I see...

127
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,130
Hey, there,

128
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:21,320
so are you here because of San Ah's dad dying?

129
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,790
I mean, why are you doing this here?

130
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,510
It doesn't have anything to do with In Sook, does it?

131
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:32,520
She was here on that day, she doesn't know anything.

132
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:38,190
Woo Cheon! Did you bring him here for questioning?

133
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:43,140
Didn't that handsome detective say he already investigated him?

134
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,320
But why did you guys bring him here?

135
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,520
He says he's a volunteer here.

136
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,460
Woo Cheon is? Since when?

137
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,750
- After the murder case went down. 
 - What?

138
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,940
 Phone! We need to call!

139
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,660
 Call someone!

140
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,510
 Oh, gosh!

141
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,990
Tetrodotoxin.

142
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:20,070
It's globe-fish poison. Tetrodotoxin.

143
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:23,690
There was white foam pooling around his mouth and nose.

144
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:28,060
It's been confirmed that they found congested blood and multiple petechiae in his palpebral conjunctiva.

145
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:33,950
Yes. Jo Si Yeong, finish the testifier investigation first.

146
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:40,510
What's the deal with Park Doo Jin? Who killed him, and what's up with the moss rose?

147
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,200
- Did Woo Cheon take a commission to do it? 
 - No.

148
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,350
- How do you know? 
 - Because I was with him.

149
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,040
- You didn't do it with him? 
 - Hey.

150
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,530
I mean, it's really weird.

151
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:54,190
Did those detectives go there because of Park Doo Jin, or because of us?

152
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,290
They arrived as soon as Park Doo Jin's body was found.

153
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,330
That means they were already on their way.

154
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:02,650
They said something suspicious came to light in the Ha Yong Geun murder case.

155
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:05,830
The DNA results came out.

156
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:09,610
We didn't take DNA tests.

157
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,930
- Then... 
 - We have to end it now.

158
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,170
You two, don't say anything.

159
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:20,200
I swung, and you don't know what happened after that.

160
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,050
After that? What's after that?

161
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,180
Aren't you going to eat?

162
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,830
They said the investigation will start soon. Hurry and come out!

163
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:37,230
You mean to say that you will conduct an investigation here?

164
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,900
Of course, you should do that.

165
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:43,060
You can't just take terminally ill patients to the police station.

166
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,920
This side is more suitable for the person being investigated.

167
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,050
- I'm more comfortable here. 
 - It's all right, let her be.

168
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,480
All right, on that day...

169
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,620
Um, please leave.

170
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,150
- Oh, must I? 
 - Yes.

171
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,310
- I see. 
 - Yes.

172
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,250
All right... On that day, you posted something on social media.

173
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,200
- What the heck? Do you follow me? 
 - No.

174
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,060
"Is it a crime to take one bad guy with me when I'm dying?"

175
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,210
What about it? What's the big deal about social media?

176
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,570
It's my space to post and delete whatever I want as I please.

177
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:34,680
- I post and delete things multiple times a day, is that a crime too? 
 - No, that's not a crime.

178
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,500
- But given how unexpected it was... 
 - I'm sorry that it was unexpected.

179
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,330
Where are In Sook and Se Yeon?

180
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,440
- They will be investigated separately. 
 - By who?

181
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,810
- That person? 
 - What?

182
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:51,300
- I mean, why am I stuck with you? 
 - Why?

183
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:57,390
- Do you dislike me? 
 - Well, that handsome higher-up guy is investigating In Sook and Se Yeon,

184
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:00,380
why am I with a nobody like you?

185
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,190
"Nobody"?

186
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,070
Where were you and what were you doing at the time of Park Doo Jin's murder?

187
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,590
- What time was that? 
 - Dawn...

188
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,370
I was obviously asleep!

189
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:17,200
Breathing alone is difficult enough for me; do I look like I would kill someone on the beach?

190
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,530
Forget it. This is an abuse of power.

191
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,640
Anyway, I'm claiming my right to silence.

192
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,050
- Hey, I'm not done. Please sit down. 
 - Hey, Oppa.

193
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,340
Tetrodotoxin? That's not my area of expertise.

194
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,150
That's poison.

195
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:49,060
- But I did see a guy distributing it once when I was in jail... 
 - On that shore,

196
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,270
there is "Sea Breeze." It's a company that adds pufferfish meat

197
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:56,910
into pufferfish extract, and produces that

198
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:00,020
to sell to terminal cancer patients.

199
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,410
They also sell pufferfish poison in powder form.

200
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:07,310
I saw on the news that he ordered food for delivery and didn't leave his house.

201
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:12,020
A gang has a hold of the delivery field in that neighborhood.

202
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,300
Is it the Guseong Gang?

203
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,680
How do you know that?

204
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,620
How do you know that, Hyungnim?

205
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,450
On the day of Ha Yong Geun's murder, you were at the crime scene with Sung Mi Do and Kang Se Yeon, weren't you?

206
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,730
 Don't say anything for now. We need to buy time.

207
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:38,010
 We could get framed for the second murder, too.

208
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,660
If you don't say anything, you will be put at a greater disadvantage.

209
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,780
Did the DNA test results come out?

210
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,260
Yes.

211
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,190
- Then... 
 - Kang Se Yeon will be brought to the station first.

212
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,820
Unnie...

213
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,830
Are you crazy?

214
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,660
What is this about?

215
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,820
What did I do wrong for you to do this?

216
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,850
I'm being like this because I really don't understand.

217
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,620
Do you think it's because I'll abandon my mother-in-law?

218
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,690
Is that really it? Huh? Money?

219
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,630
Hey, we lived together for ten years... Is this all that amounts to?

220
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,230
Let's talk later.

221
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,750
Talk about what later?

222
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,790
Since you're sick...

223
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,990
Since you're sick, I tried to overlook it thinking about that.

224
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,690
Listen up. I will never get divorced!

225
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:53,060
I found a lawyer too, and they said that we can never get divorced over this.

226
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,320
There's no real reason; you're just uselessly exerting yourself.

227
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,860
As a matter of fact, you're more at fault!

228
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:06,230
- I'm at fault? 
 - You always go and buy a ton of groceries at the store and let the food go bad.

229
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,240
It's the same with my mom. There's been more than a few times

230
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,680
when something has almost happened when I left her at home.

231
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,660
On top of that, all of that money that's gone into your miscarriages... You seriously...

232
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,530
- So that was it? 
 - I'm really tired!

233
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,260
Hey!

234
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,400
What do I become if I get divorced by my wife who has cancer?

235
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,090
Wouldn't you just become a husband

236
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,970
who helps out his money-hungry and terminally-ill wife?

237
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,250
Seriously, why are you being like this?!

238
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,290
Seriously, why are you like this? Se Yeon, why are you doing this?

239
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,150
Let's come to our senses, please.

240
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:46,230
Are you, possibly... worried that I might suffer alone after you die?

241
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,690
- Are you trying to let me go before you die or something? 
 - Excuse me.

242
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,530
- I'm Sergeant Oh Jin Kyu from the police investigation unit. 
 - You're a police officer?

243
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:56,850
Why are the police here? Oh, because of the golf club?

244
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,030
- Let's go. 
 - Wait a second.

245
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:03,050
Wait a moment. What's going on?

246
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:08,670
All of a sudden there's divorce and murder... Everything's gone to crap after you came here.

247
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,430
I told you, let's go home.

248
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:15,090
You weren't originally this kind of person, right?

249
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:18,730
The Kang Se Yeon who I loved was not this kind of woman.

250
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,920
What kind of person am I?

251
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,590
- What? 
 - I killed him.

252
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,640
What?

253
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,760
You know...

254
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,890
that I tried to kill your mother, too.

255
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,300
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

256
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,430
What are you talking about?

257
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,550
Even though I'm a murderer,

258
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,820
you still love me. Right?

259
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,420
Se Yeon...

260
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:52,100
Stay still for now. Even if you step in now, there's nothing that you can do.

261
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,660
I realized what happened after I came to my senses the next day.

262
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,730
- You remembered? 
 - Yes.

263
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:13,360
While I was doing a sleep study, I remembered the scene all of a sudden.

264
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,490
I'm going towards that man while holding the golf club.

265
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:24,210
- So you brought the golf club back to your house? 
 - Yes.

266
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,110
There was nowhere to hide it properly.

267
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:35,130
Let's get this straight. Pyo In Sook brought Sung Mi Do with her when she left because she was worried about her grandmother

268
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:40,250
and you followed them out carrying your husband's golf club, and swung it?

269
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,360
While sleep-walking?

270
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,820
Yes.

271
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:50,210
And you don't remember anything else?

272
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,620
Yes.

273
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,790
It's true that the three of you went to the crime scene, and Min Woo Cheon appeared there.

274
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,500
At least that's true.

275
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,500
At least?

276
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,100
At least.

277
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,040
Who strangled him in the time in between?

278
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,270
Even if Kang Se Yeon hit him, the cause of death was suffocation.

279
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,800
We're still blank on who strangled him.

280
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,830
But a second victim appeared dead with a moss rose stuck in his hair.

281
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:31,860
Are these two cases really connected?

282
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,200
This time, there are no moss roses growing in the street. It's a beach over there.

283
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,050
This one was flown in from somewhere. The murder crime scene is like that as a whole.

284
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,630
It feels extremely clean and produced.

285
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,060
All right, then

286
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:52,890
Park Doo Jin ate pufferfish poison at home, and then someone transferred his already dead body to the beach and laid him there.

287
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:56,020
They then placed a flower on him that they carefully flew in.

288
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,890
Killing him wasn't their goal.

289
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,510
It must have been to create an exhibit.

290
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,370
Yeah, Oppa.

291
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:07,290
No... I can't leave the hospice right now...

292
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,730
Really?

293
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:13,120
- You'll bring the dress here? 
 - You guys went out that day, right?

294
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,100
- Did Se Yeon do it? 
 - Oppa, I'll call you in a little bit.

295
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,530
- It's not us. 
 - What about Park Doo Jin?

296
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,720
Did Se Yeon do that to Park Doo Jin, too?

297
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,390
- How could she pull that off? 
 - Yeah.

298
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:30,150
You and Woo Cheon slept in a room together!

299
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,930
So you didn't have time to do that, right?

300
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,890
You guys slept, you must have!

301
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:37,990
- We went through so much trying to get you two together, spreading flowers and everything! 
 - What?

302
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,890
- You spread flowers? 
 - Yeah.

303
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,620
What the heck? Weren't those sent to me by my boyfriend?

304
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:46,460
- No wonder they went missing. 
 - That's not important.

305
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,000
What happened? The two of you...

306
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,330
- We didn't kill Park Doo Jin. 
 - No–

307
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,170
Did you sleep together..?

308
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,500
How could you ask that to her face like that?

309
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,950
Then, where should I turn to ask?

310
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:14,410
Since they received the petition, they'll send in the defense.

311
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:17,320
If your husband behaves that way, it won't be easy.

312
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,790
If the mediation doesn't work, there will be a family investigation.

313
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:24,930
From the court's perspective, they'll investigate the cause of your breakup.

314
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,230
You should prepare well.

315
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,670
Why don't you ask me anything?

316
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,150
- What? 
 - Me, right now,

317
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,910
I am here because I killed a person.

318
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,740
Why don't you ask me anything?

319
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:54,310
Because this is all I can do for you.

320
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,620
 Let's not plan out everything.

321
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,460
 We need to.

322
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:51,320
 If we're using the Eurail Pass, we need to know exactly where we've already gone and where we're going.

323
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,220
 We might fight during the trip.

324
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:58,250
 I want to experience a place before deciding how long to stay there.

325
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,220
 No.

326
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,790
 Do you want to go to a specific country?

327
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:06,500
 Yes. Italy.

328
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,830
 Sounds nice. But why?

329
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,520
 That painting. I want to see it in person.

330
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,990
 That's in the Louvre, in Paris.

331
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,550
 What?

332
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,660
 - Really? 
 - Why do you want to see that painting?

333
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,760
 Look. Those two women are looking after the baby, right.

334
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,300
 People say that Leonardo da Vinci

335
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,460
 painted a fantasy about a stepmother

336
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,430
 and a real mother. But my thinking is different.

337
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:39,070
 I think the women are a couple and are raising the kid together.

338
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:44,450
 Don't you think so? I want to live like that.

339
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,830
 What else do you want to do on the trip?

340
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,530
 I want to do everything that is prohibited in Korea.

341
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,050
 For example?

342
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,810
 Try to guess.

343
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,430
 Is there something that can only be done in foreign countries?

344
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,650
 Kiss.

345
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,240
 Kiss?

346
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:15,500
Her eyes. Mom didn't say anything after that.

347
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,630
She acted as if nothing ever happened.

348
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:21,950
Making me think nothing really happened.

349
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:26,130
After that, everything was embarrassing.

350
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,860
I...

351
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:33,160
My existence itself was embarrassing.

352
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,730
You, who looked so cool,

353
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,180
now looked shabby.

354
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:46,120
Just because of her expression that day.

355
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:51,540
I know. After that, a dozen times, and a hundred times...

356
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,160
Those eyes met mine.

357
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,390
That day, I did go to the airport.

358
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:03,100
 But in the end, I came back. After coming back, I ran away.

359
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,970
Sine then, I have been running away.

360
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,760
I graduated, got a job, and got married.

361
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:14,970
I ran away so that I could live normally, without standing out in front of other people.

362
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,950
In the end, I am here.

363
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,570
It's not your fault.

364
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,920
But you didn't do that, right?

365
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,690
I was defensive in my own way.

366
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:33,730
I live with a shield. Maybe I became a lawyer because of that.

367
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:38,510
I stacked up my resume tirelessly so that people wouldn't ignore me.

368
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,780
I tried hard to have more than what everyone else had.

369
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:46,830
Sometimes, I had these thoughts also.

370
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:54,240
What if I had left with you, then?

371
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:58,130
What if I had lived the way I wanted to?

372
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,790
Would my life have been a little different?

373
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,790
You would have regretted whatever you would have done.

374
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:05,730
If you had run away, you'd feel disappointed that you did so.

375
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:10,190
If you had fought against it, you might've thought things were too difficult.

376
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:16,000
But at the very least, I didn't want to become this kind of a person.

377
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,530
What kind of a person are you?

378
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,140
Why did you turn yourself in?

379
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:30,860
I have passed through it already.

380
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:35,390
My bright times have all gone by.

381
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,530
But for them, it is now.

382
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,700
They are dashing now.

383
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,000
I can see them shine.

384
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,400
Because they are shining too bright,

385
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:02,620
I wanted to give them some time.

386
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:42,730
- Should you really be cooking right now? 
 - Yes.

387
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:46,610
So, the person who shares the room with you,

388
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:49,770
did she really kill that person?

389
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:53,530
Why? How does she know him?

390
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:58,250
Say something. My mind is going crazy.

391
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,000
Don't try to think too much.

392
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,410
So, Woo Cheon...

393
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,630
That guy... From when did you know him?

394
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:08,280
- For a very long time. 
 - Oh goodness!

395
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,090
Speaking nonsense.

396
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:13,150
When did you ever have a guy? Rare thing.

397
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,590
What do you know?

398
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:18,940
There were boys who came with their parents because you beat them up.

399
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,500
There was no guy that liked you.

400
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:28,450
So, are you making this for Woo Cheon?

401
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,130
Yes.

402
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:36,150
So... you are in that kind of a relationship with him?

403
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:39,650
- Yes. 
 - Really?

404
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,370
Why are you smiling?

405
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:51,110
- Me? 
 - Is it good? Do you think he's all right?

406
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,650
I am very grateful.

407
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:55,710
Hey.... Nothing to be grateful for.

408
00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:01,050
I find it interesting and nice that you have a guy in this situation.

409
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,250
I also feel nice being here like this with you.

410
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:11,650
Like nothing is going on. It's nice.

411
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,370
Try it.

412
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:20,700
- What are you doing? 
 - Pancake.

413
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,640
It's all torn. You must have flipped it incorrectly.

414
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,690
Somehow, you tried to keep it together with honey.

415
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,350
Try it. It tastes good.

416
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:39,130
Why are you doing such soft things?

417
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,270
Soft things?

418
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,850
We are not in a normal relationship, right?

419
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,840
I think I like sleeping together. I slept well.

420
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,150
So, the sleep in liking sleeping together

421
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:56,620
is different from the sleep in saying I slept well.

422
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:00,170
- I slept well after doing it— 
 - All right. I understand.

423
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,650
I feel very close to you.

424
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,050
- Yes. 
 - So, that feeling was like...

425
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,870
How do I put this?

426
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,280
What have you decided?

427
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,270
What?

428
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:20,750
You are like this whenever you make a decision. Very unnatural.

429
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:29,070
Try it. Wait.

430
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:32,740
I made this with so much difficulty.

431
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,440
How is it?

432
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,690
- Salty. 
 - Salty?

433
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:45,570
It was salt and not sugar. What to do?

434
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,730
Will you turn yourself in?

435
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,890
I told you I will do that after the picnic.

436
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:57,330
I will get Se Yeon out. Because she doesn't know it was death from suffocation.

437
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:00,510
It's me; nobody other than me.

438
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:04,810
- The person who can wrap up this situation. 
 - The situation has changed.

439
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:08,350
After the second murder, it will become a serial murder case.

440
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,970
First, we have to check the mobile phone.

441
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:15,180
Whatever is there in that mobile phone, it's not proof of the murder.

442
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,790
It's not like that person had murdered.

443
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:19,720
That guy could have killed Park Doo Jin.

444
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,170
- But why? 
 - The crime scene was like that. Like it was all made up.

445
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:28,900
There are not many people who can do that.

446
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,120
Don't step up. Stay quiet.

447
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:37,580
I want to do that the most.

448
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,740
I want to stay quiet the most.

449
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:44,260
I just want to reveal the truth and stay out of this case.

450
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,950
Now, I really need some time.

451
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:53,370
- I just wanted to live. 
 - Just do that.

452
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,050
Let's do that.

453
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:59,340
- Why can't we? Why can't we do that? 
 - You know.

454
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:04,400
Not having parents by your side when young, remaining alone.

455
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:09,520
Though others might not, we know what that feels like.

456
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:17,750
Ultimately, it's something I started.

457
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:21,910
I tried to kill him, and he might have died like that, also.

458
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:24,210
So, I need to end this.

459
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,570
I know who "1" is.

460
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,830
Koo Ji Pyo.

461
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,580
The situation cannot become worse.

462
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:02,690
We will announce our wedding soon. Succession will also be decided.

463
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:06,020
But if the scandal continues, Father will come to know.

464
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:10,790
It will end now. Se Yeon turned herself in.

465
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:15,200
I think that is right. Because she was in the state of sleepwalking.

466
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,670
It will be considered an extenuating circumstance.

467
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:22,020
I have also agreed to be the witness. I will coordinate with In Sook—

468
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,090
Then, what about Park Doo Jin's murder?

469
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:28,900
- What? 
 - He died near the sea, right? With the flower on him.

470
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,650
- We didn't do that. 
 - Are you sure?

471
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:34,350
I heard those two were also near the sea.

472
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,540
 Why him?

473
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:45,040
He is a rich person, right? So why?

474
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,290
That's why he must have something big to hide.

475
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:52,230
Koo Ji Pyo ordered the killing of Ha Yong Geun, and everything is messed up now.

476
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,960
The reason must be inside the phone.

477
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:06,850
I will wait outside. First, try on the dress. Let's talk later.

478
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:12,730
Then, what about Mi Do?

479
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,780
We should tell her.

480
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:20,130
- We are not sure of anything yet, right? 
 - Then will you let her marry him without knowing what kind of a person he is?

481
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,380
It might be better for her to not know.

482
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,190
We are all dying anyway.

483
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:33,630
It might be better to die without waking up from happiness.

484
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,260
You look very pretty.

485
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,350
It suits you very well.

486
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:36,170
Oppa, how do I look?

487
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:42,010
Wow. You are the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in this world.

488
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,690
Really?

489
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,550
 - Min Woo Cheon picked up the call, right? 
 - Yes.

490
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:00,400
 - Do you think he knows it's me? 
 - No.

491
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,910
 Not at all.

492
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,510
Do I look pretty?

493
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:13,110
Yes. Pretty.

494
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:18,910
It's funny that I am doing this in this situation, right?

495
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,420
No.

496
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:27,650
I feel very strange. I have dreamed of this moment hundreds and thousands of times.

497
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:31,650
Even though that moment is now, I still feel like I'm dreaming.

498
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,480
Pinch me.

499
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,570
Ouch!

500
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,650
- It hurts. 
 - It's not a dream.

501
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,390
It isn't, right?

502
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,410
How do you feel?

503
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:56,160
It feels strange, right? You are looking at your loved person wearing the wedding dress for the first time.

504
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,420
I think I would feel very weird if In Sook were wearing that.

505
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:07,070
I have one more dress. How about trying it on?

506
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,490
Where are you holding the wedding?

507
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,430
How about the hotel from that day? You had liked that bathroom so much.

508
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:19,480
That you could even live there.

509
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:29,720
Coming to think of it, a bathroom is just a bathroom.

510
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:36,260
No matter how shiny and flashy it is, a bathroom is just a bathroom.

511
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,240
Shit.

512
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,620
Let's-Let's meet there.

513
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:51,660
What's this? How did you come back again?

514
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:57,660
I don't know. I turned myself in, saying I hit him with the golf club.

515
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,320
The detective was not even surprised.

516
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,560
Even my husband's DNA was detected on the golf club.

517
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,740
If it won't end here, what about this wedding?

518
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,220
Now, Ji Pyo is also anxious.

519
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,020
"At least."

520
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,880
- What? 
 - He said, "at least that."

521
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:23,550
"We went to the crime scene and met Woo Cheon."

522
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:26,690
"At least that much is true." That's what he said.

523
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,620
- At least that much is true? 
 - Yea.

524
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:36,440
 - It wasn't us.  
 - I heard those two were near the sea at the time.

525
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,220
You are hiding something, right?

526
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:47,700
How come you aren't surprised or saying anything? Se Yeon got released.

527
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:53,490
It's Woo Cheon, right? Did he really do something?

528
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:58,230
Honestly, the situation has become complicated because he put that damn flower on him.

529
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,810
Also, because he was a contract murderer, I feel the situation has worsened.

530
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,470
You stop it.

531
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,690
What is it? Tell everything without hiding.

532
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,950
If you want to hide it, then that's up to you.

533
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:19,090
Regardless, you have the key to ending this situation.

534
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,960
Hiding or revealing—

535
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,570
- Sung Mi Do. 
 - Why?

536
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:25,880
I can't end it here.

537
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,960
You know, me...

538
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,090
I have always wanted to receive love.

539
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:34,290
Do you know how that feels?

540
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:40,200
It's like being a dog. You wait the whole day for your master.

541
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:46,470
And if the master doesn't show up, you feel anxious and throw tantrums. You try to act cute or do anything for attention.

542
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:52,370
Maybe because of that, whenever I see a dog, I feel annoyed.

543
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,970
It tries too hard to be loved.

544
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,500
But...

545
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,320
I am like that.

546
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,520
I did all sorts of things to be loved my whole life.

547
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:09,560
But now, a few days away from death,

548
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:14,650
like a lie, everything is about to come true.

549
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:18,790
If I do everything and die, won't I feel a little less unfair?

550
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:21,230
I think I can die like that.

551
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,560
Without anything happening,

552
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,230
without anyone knowing, I don't want to die like that.

553
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,240
What are you?

554
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,370
- What? 
 - What do you want to accomplish?

555
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,600
Daughter-in-law of a rich family?

556
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,240
Is that what you really want?

557
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,190
Is that really the thing you want to achieve before dying?

558
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:47,680
The thing you want to accomplish before death is a pathetic title?

559
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,540
Don't you think a pathetic title is better than being remembered as a murderer?

560
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,840
Stop it. I...

561
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,120
You. Don't think of taking all the responsibility alone.

562
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,130
You get it?

563
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,240
You have always been on her side.

564
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,470
- What?  
 - That's right.

565
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:08,720
I know that too. I don't care.

566
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,500
People usually don't really like me.

567
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,150
Because I am pretty, they get a little interested,

568
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:19,730
they keep me by their side. But it all withers soon and they leave.

569
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:21,750
Guys are like that, too.

570
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:25,050
The more I love them, the more they get tired.

571
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:27,530
So, showing myself?

572
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:32,970
I don't. I am used to putting up a front.

573
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:34,870
I know it, too.

574
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:40,370
But, Ji Pyo is next to me, right?

575
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:43,480
Even when I told him I murdered someone, he was by my side.

576
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,550
He told me he will try everything to help me.

577
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:48,700
Do you know how much that matters to me?

578
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:13,130

579
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:17,260
Yes.

580
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:19,650
A strand of hair?

581
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:22,590
 A hair strand was found in Park Doo Jin's shirt button.

582
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,610
 It is not Park Doo Jin's hair.

583
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:27,750
 Hand us the DNA of the suspects to be further investigated.

584
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:30,020
Yes, all right.

585
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,420
A strand of hair.

586
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:49,800
Grandmother.

587
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,180
Why? What happened?

588
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,750
San Ah is missing.

589
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:55,660
What? Didn't she go to school?

590
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:59,510
Today, she strangely wanted to go to school. After that, I left for work.

591
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:04,080
I received a phone call that she didn't go to school.

592
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:07,150
Then? Where did she go?

593
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:22,300
 I know who "1" is.

594
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,330
 Koo Ji Pyo.

595
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:29,380
 Then will you let her marry him without knowing who he is?

596
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,060
I didn't say that because I dislike Mi Do.

597
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:37,140
It's just that I want her to understand.

598
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:45,020
What she really wants, and whether she really loves that person.

599
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:49,640
What is love?

600
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:55,850
However shabby that person may be...

601
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:58,430
 Buying tons of food from the mart and letting it rot.

602
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:01,540
 And all the money that was used because of the miscarriages.

603
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:04,410
...even if the world is against you,

604
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,170
being able to embrace them.

605
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,160
Hey, hey!

606
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,050
Grandma.

607
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,830
San Ah is missing. She didn't even go to school.

608
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:45,120
- What? 
 - Actually, San Ah has been strange these days.

609
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:49,420
She holds on to her mom, not letting her go to work.

610
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:52,560
Every morning, she doesn't go to school also.

611
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,360
Why? Is it because of that photo?

612
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,690
She keeps getting hurt here and there.

613
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:03,640
I thought maybe other kids did it, so I went to her school once.

614
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:07,350
About that... it looks like she inflicted it upon herself.

615
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:10,090
She hurt her body here and there.

616
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:12,830
It if heals up, then she scrapes it off again.

617
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:15,630
She even has weird marks on her limbs.

618
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:17,320
You should've taken her to the hospital.

619
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,230
She is hurt. She should go!

620
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:21,520
She didn't want to go anywhere.

621
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,740
She just stays home and holds onto her mom.

622
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:28,890
By asking why she abandoned her earlier. And if she would run away again.

623
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:33,230
But this morning, strangely,

624
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:35,970
she said she would go to school.

625
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:39,330
But her school called up to say she didn't come.

626
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:41,110
Where did she go?

627
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:43,240
Did you report it?

628
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:46,200
I reported it a long time ago. They only ask me to wait.

629
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,540
I will go.

630
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:50,670
Hey! Hey, In Sook!

631
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:54,330

632
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:56,320

633
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,780

634
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:02,610
Who do I request?

635
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,080
I need to leave.

636
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,740
What?

637
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:11,720
It seems San Ah caused self-harm. She must be having a hard time.

638
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,370
In a deadly amount of pain.

639
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:15,420
San Ah. What if she is dead?

640
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,670
- Children don't commit suicide. 
 - But she caused self-harm.

641
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:20,050
Self-harm is not done in order to die.

642
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:24,700
Because it was too hard to bear it.

643
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:27,860
They do it to just let someone know.

644
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:31,420
I did that.

645
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,370
Let's go.

646
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:55,100
It looks like we need to do the midway briefing.

647
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,160
Not yet.

648
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,920
Did you see the "Request to Kill" List that got posted?

649
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,990
It's spreading like crazy.

650
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:06,900
That the serial murder case culprit is looking for his next target.

651
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,620
That he is receiving a list.

652
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,940
What do they mean by #Movement?

653
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:13,320
Where did it originate from?

654
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:17,130
The Cyber Investigation Team is in the middle of tracking it.

655
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,830
The higher-ups want to announce

656
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:25,460
that there's at least a likely suspect.

657
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,010
Yes?

658
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:38,630
She left the hospice?

659
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:42,100
It was an urgent situation. So I couldn't do anything.

660
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,780
Because they are close,

661
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:48,060
they might know well where the kid could have gone.

662
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:51,340
They are moving in a hospice vehicle now.

663
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:54,370
They will come back as soon as they find the child.

664
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:56,080
I understand.

665
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,490
Let's track the vehicle.

666
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,360
She can't have gone far away from the neighborhood.

667
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:10,220
From the bus stop to the market near the alley. Let's look at all places she visited.

668
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:12,220
It's already been six hours.

669
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:15,800
She might want to hide right now.

670
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,920
Think again.

671
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,260
Any location she mentioned or any place she visits frequently.

672
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:24,250
Children hide in familiar places.

673
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:32,400
 Why this one?

674
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,860
 San Ah wants this one.

675
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:41,010
 Why do you need this? How will you use it?

676
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,580
 To hide...

677
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,790
 What?

678
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:48,240
 ...To hide.

679
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,100
San Ah.

680
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,940
Why did you do that?

681
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:47,650
Why didn't I try to escape?

682
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:54,570
If I had escaped, nothing would have happened.

683
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:01,160
It's all over. It's all gone by.

684
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:06,910
I wish I disappeared.

685
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:10,060
I wish I was not visible.

686
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:14,610
Everyone is having a hard time because of me.

687
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:19,790
Mom and you.

688
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:21,670
No.

689
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:28,410
You... You are having the hardest time.

690
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:37,590
But you have a life ahead of you.

691
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:41,860
Do you know how amazing that is?

692
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:48,220
You should move forward.

693
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:54,810
Until when will you stay like this, hurting in the same place?

694
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:59,000
I couldn't receive an apology.

695
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,880
I should have received an apology from my father.

696
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,850
I couldn't receive an apology because he died.

697
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,230
But...

698
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:21,850
did you kill another man again?

699
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,860
Hyung, where are you?

700
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,880
It's all o-over.

701
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:08,200
 I t-told you to not get involved anymore. If you did, you'd be in danger.

702
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:12,090
Park Seung Seon left the country. He said the problem will get worse.

703
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:15,440
Where is the cellphone? We have to confirm it.

704
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,160
Woo Cheon, I have things to protect, too.

705
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,650
Where is the cellphone?

706
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:25,270
 This is the best option considering my family.

707
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:28,020
I'll end it by giving them the phone.

708
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:03,430
If I disappear, go to that bridge.

709
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:09,660
Just like how I did for my mom back then, I'll leave you a message there.

710
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:14,090
What are you saying all of a sudden?

711
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:21,350
Just making a promise between us two.

712
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:26,130
Whenever it may be, so that you won't have to look so much.

713
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:44,200
- Hyungnim! 
 - You scared me!

714
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,670
Why am I your hyungnim? One look and it's obvious that I'm younger.

715
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:49,430
Our hyungnim disappeared.

716
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:51,170
That's right. Park Seung Seon has been quiet.

717
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:53,730
I'm wondering if someone killed him, because he disappeared without a word.

718
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:55,210
Do you think I did it?

719
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:57,550
Well...

720
00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:00,430
Things kept getting messy as he got involved with that guy.

721
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:01,890
That guy?

722
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:04,860
Hyungnim told me not to say anything though.

723
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,970
Come here. Over here.

724
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:12,720
What is it? Say it.

725
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:17,880
The picture you showed us for the Moss Rose Case,

726
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,520
- that... 
 - Yes, Min Woo Cheon.

727
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,130
Yes.

728
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:23,550
- I know that guy. 
 - That's right. You said you saw him at the gambling den.

729
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:26,350
That's not it.

730
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:28,710
That guy is the best one.

731
00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:31,910
He's the ace of Narae's Cleaning.

732
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:34,510
They call him, "The White Dog." Apparently, he's a legend in this field.

733
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:37,690
He only kills the bad guys who deserve to die after doing extensive background research.

734
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:39,360
Isn't that exactly him?

735
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:42,210
Ha Yong Geun and Park Doo Jin. Those guys are so bad they deserve to be killed.

736
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:46,920
Besides a professional like him, who else could've committed murder without leaving a single trace?

737
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,280
I'm telling you, I'm right.

738
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:55,670
What?

739
00:55:55,670 --> 00:56:00,400
I heard he was at the emergency room and then went to San Ah's home.

740
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:07,650
Thank you.

741
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,930
- Hey... 
 - Mom.

742
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:21,440
You can't go anywhere.

743
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:25,790
Don't leave me.

744
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:28,140
Mom...

745
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,260
Mom...

746
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,320
 They'll pin it as a serial murder now that there's a second murder.

747
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:18,010
 I have to check the mobile phone first.

748
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:21,270
 If I disappear...

749
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:32,350
Hello?

750
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:33,730
Where is Min Woo Cheon?

751
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:36,130
 He's not here. He disappeared.

752
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:38,290
The hospice car is gone, too?

753
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:39,930
Yes.

754
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:44,110
Come back to the hospice now, In Sook.

755
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:52,180
 Is that person aware that you know?

756
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:53,220
 I'm not sure.

757
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,750
 There's no way that person will come here nonchalantly like this if they knew.

758
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:59,320
 They probably think it doesn't make much difference whether I know or not.

759
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,600
 What are you going to do now?

760
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:08,900
 I have to find clues for the second murder.

761
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,050
Stop.

762
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:13,560
Don't come anymore.

763
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,600
Put it down over there.

764
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:26,740
You're going to k-keep your p-promise, right?

765
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:30,600
Hey, you're the one who called me first. You'll have to trust me then.

766
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,540
There's no other choice for you, really.

767
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:53,600
H-Hey! Woo Cheon!

768
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,350
Woo Cheon.

769
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:10,700
- We found where the hospice car went. Leave immediately. 
 - Yes, Ma'am.

770
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:25,670
 - What's going on? 
 - We can't go in right now.

771
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:27,920
 I've been waiting for a while now.

772
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,260
 About two hours.

773
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:32,190
 I got a text.

774
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:31,670

775
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:33,870
♫  I will be like  ♫

776
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:37,490
♫  Star.  ♫

777
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:40,640
 I basically killed her. I can't forget it.

778
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,470
 I shouldn't have gone there.

779
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:44,510
 I hope you'll think that you did it for me.

780
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:46,660
 Is Woo Cheon alive?

781
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:49,320
 - Is he? 
 - This was made with concrete. I heard it'll collapse soon.

782
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,300
 I'm sure nobody knows you're underneath here.

783
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:52,560
 Park Seung Seon is dead.

784
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,740
 Everyone is going to die in the end. There's nothing we can do.

785
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:58,170
 I worked my butt off, tending to her every need.

786
01:01:58,170 --> 01:02:00,970
 Your wife doesn't love you.

787
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:02,070
 I need to protect In sook.

788
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:07,470
 Where are you? Tell me. I'll go wherever you are.

789
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:11,450
♫  Just you alone  ♫
