1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,270
 This place, where only life and death exist,

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,350
 Morning Light.

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,670
 At this place, where I came to organize my life...

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,210
 - Let go, while I'm being nice! 
 - They're pulling hair!

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,500
 ...I feel warmth.

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,350
 - I feel happiness again. 
 - One, two, three!

7
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,800

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,120
 The lily of the valley's meaning is "newfound happiness".

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,850
 But it's strange. The lily of the valley is toxic.

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,020
 Could newfound happiness be... toxic?

11
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,310

12
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,020
 Because you can never let it go...

13
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,180
 Because it can't be taken away...

14
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,780
 Hello?

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,160
Oppa...

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,540
 Mi Do?

17
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,820

18
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,850

19
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,270

20
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,940
 The phone is turned off, leave a message after the beep...

21
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,270
 - You're saying that it isn't a serial murder? 
 - Yes.

22
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,100
 What about the first case with Ha Yong Geun, and the second with Park Du Jin?

23
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,120
 Didn't you say that Pyo In Sook turned herself in?

24
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,310
 We are planning to do a total reinvestigation.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,580
What are you doing right now?

26
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,930
Why? I shouldn't?

27
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,910
How... why are they here?

28
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,730
Haven't you seen the news? The police said that they are doing a reinvestigation from the beginning.

29
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,230
What? From the beginning?

30
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,620
When will this end?

31
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,030
I held back up until now out of respect for In Sook,

32
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,500
but things keep repeating! Why do I have to keep conceding?

33
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,040
In Sook said that she would take the blame for everything, too.

34
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,430
Sure, but why is she being like this all of a sudden?

35
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,970
She's in a bad state right now.

36
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,070
I'm in a bad state, too! Don't you see me?

37
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,180
I'm trying my best to hold it in!

38
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,780
As if nothing is wrong...

39
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,240
I think I understand you now.

40
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,530
Even if In Sook becomes the culprit from you reporting her,

41
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,200
even if you get that marriage that you want so badly,

42
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,920
you will never be happy.

43
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,650
You will never be satisfied. That's who you are.

44
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,890
Ji Hoo, look.

45
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,160
Mi Do made you an account while she was taking pictures, right?

46
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,720
Yeah, during the party.

47
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,190
As if she was playing with dolls,

48
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,200
she dressed me up and joked around like this.

49
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,520
Grandma! You have over a thousand followers!

50
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,720
- What's a follow? 
 - They're people who want to be friends with you.

51
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,970
They want to be friends with me?

52
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,520
- Why? Who? 
 - Here are the comments.

53
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,580
The people who left comments said that they want to be friends with you.

54
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,850
"Grandma Legend," "Isn't the pose crazy?"

55
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,810
"She's so pretty, no cap"

56
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,530
- They're looking at me and saying I'm crazy? 
 - My goodness.

57
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:58,680
- What does no cap mean? 
 - It's a good thing.

58
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,880
No cap. No cap! No cap...

59
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,200
I felt like we had to catch the trash that is playing games with people's lives.

60
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,420
Yes... That's true, but that's not under our jurisdiction.

61
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,450
What about you, Detective? I only trust you.

62
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,980
Yes, well, I guess I'll give it a shot.

63
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,810
- Grandma said that the transaction took place in front of her house. 
 - Is that right?

64
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,990
But with Pyo In Sook on the run, why would she go through the trouble to get that medicine...

65
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,230
That's what I'm saying. There's no CCTV in that area,

66
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,590
but apparently, the police are staking out since she's on the run.

67
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,250
Wouldn't there be something left in a blackbox video?

68
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,550
Well, probably.

69
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:57,810
If you look through that, wouldn't that damn old woman be recorded somehow?

70
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:02,130
Wow, but how do you know so much about that, Miss Nun?

71
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,970
- Woo Cheonâ€“ 
 - Veronica.

72
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,620
Buddha. 
  (T/N: Buddha sounds similar to Woo Cheon)

73
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,240
- Pardon? 
 - Buddha...

74
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,430
- Ah... Buddha? 
 - Yeah!

75
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,690
Why isn't Grandma coming?

76
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,600
After you got so mad at her like that, why...

77
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,410
She said that she was going to rest today.

78
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,320
She dropped San Ah off and left.

79
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,290
They will be able to catch the scammer, don't worry.

80
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,150
I'm going to regret it.

81
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:57,830
I kept thinking that while I was getting mad at Grandma.

82
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,680
I'm really going to regret this when I die, aren't I?

83
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,280
I'm going to keep remembering this scene. I kept getting mad as I thought that.

84
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,920
I have only gotten mad at her for my entire life.

85
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,410
Because it's comforting.

86
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,970
You don't have to try and look pretty.

87
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,580
Because even then, she loves you.

88
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,720
You can do that to me, too.

89
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,270
Let's eat.

90
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,720
I said, let's eat.

91
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,980
What's wrong?

92
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,180
Are you okay?

93
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,220
What are you doing?

94
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,710
Why are you taking that medicine, without knowing what it is? What do you think is in it?

95
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,340
It's the medicine that my grandma bought me.

96
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,990
It should be good in some way or another.

97
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:39,190
It must have at least one benefit.

98
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,270
In Sook.

99
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,760
Unnie?

100
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,900
I guess we meet again.

101
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,530
How did you know?

102
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,600
You've seen the news, right?

103
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,780
What news?

104
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,240
They said that it wasn't a serial killing.

105
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,890
They announced that they are going to reinvestigate everything from the beginning.

106
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,510
Isn't that why you're here?

107
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,400
But what about Mi Do?

108
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,040
Try and understand Mi Do a little.

109
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,320
Are you okay? I heard that you went to the hospital.

110
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,920
Were you really sick?

111
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,870
I'm okay.

112
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,990
What about you? Are you okay?

113
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,760
I'm okay, too.

114
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,920
What about the divorce? What happened to the divorce?

115
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,050
How funny.

116
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:50,070
In the middle of talking about life and death, the word "divorce" jumps out.

117
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,710
In the middle of life and death, you are getting a divorce.

118
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,730

119
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,250

120
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,760

121
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,390
 I have the video.

122
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,350
 Oppa, I'm sick.

123
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,710
 I'm really sick. I miss you.

124
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,150

125
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,730
In Sook is here.

126
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,540
Chandelier...

127
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,740
What?

128
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,360
The house that Oppa and I are going to live in.

129
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,750
Above the bed in that house, there's a chandelier.

130
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:07,860
Even if you don't turn the lights on, it sparkles.

131
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,580
I don't want to die like this.

132
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,860
I said that I don't want to die here like this.

133
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:23,700
After going home and living even one more day with him,

134
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,890
that is how I want to die.

135
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:32,250
So... can't you end this here?

136
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,620
Please, can't you wrap things up here?

137
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,530
Then after that, Oppa and I will do whatever we can using our power.

138
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:49,530
Whether you're cleared of a false charge or whatever, can't you do that after?

139
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:54,180
The police are suspecting a different side, anyway.

140
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,060
Even if In Sook steps in, nothing will change.

141
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,040
Okay then, where is the different side?

142
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,780
- You and I? 
 - Regardless, it's not In Sook and Woo Cheon.

143
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:07,600
You know it, too. In Sook didn't leave during the party.

144
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,160
So who is it then?

145
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,570
Who is the police suspecting?

146
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,620
Aren't they hiding you here because there's someone else?

147
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,520
How deep does this go? What exactly are you hiding, and why?

148
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,300
Let's stop. We are somewhat responsible, too.

149
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,130
Sure, all three of us went there that day.

150
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:31,670
If I'm responsible there, I think I've taken enough responsibility.

151
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,960
But after that, I know absolutely nothing about what happened.

152
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:40,850
Things keep getting bigger, but you won't say anything.

153
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:45,450
I'm swept up like this, knowing nothing at all,

154
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,260
so I might not even be able to get married.

155
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,650
In Sook...

156
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:54,640
I helped you out every time.

157
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,980
But aren't you thinking of yourself a little too much?

158
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,020
Am I not allowed to?

159
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,530
- What did you say? 
 - I got scared since I'm dying.

160
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,690
Because I didn't want to die in jail.

161
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:12,200
I want to stay hidden here until the truth comes out.

162
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,850
I want to spend my time here, but am I not allowed to?

163
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,750
Then, what about me?

164
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,760
I can't even get in contact with the person I love, and I'm all alone here...

165
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,190
You know, he's that kind of person.

166
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,420
- What did you say? 
 - While knowing good and well what condition you're in,

167
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,390
he only contacts you when he's comfortable, and comes and goes as he pleases. That's what kind of person he is.

168
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,260
He was strange from the start.

169
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,870
Proposing all of a sudden, and then suddenly cutting off the engagement.

170
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,250
Have you really never found it to be strange?

171
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,070
What are you talking about right now?

172
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,260
Are you saying that you don't know why he would like someone like me?

173
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,320
I don't know if he actually loves you.

174
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,000
Why do you have to know, though?

175
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,830
Please stop! Everyone outside will be able to hear.

176
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:58,600
I just wish that that person...

177
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,660
could be a good person.

178
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,660
- What did you say? 
 - Looking only at you,

179
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,030
sincerely loving you,

180
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:14,160
and can make you happy. I wish he was that kind of person.

181
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,560
- If that was the case, I would justâ€“ 
 - What are you going on about, right now?

182
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,850
Is your love the only one that's so precious and affectionate?

183
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,450
What about my love then? Is my love laughable?

184
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,920
A good person? You're in love with a murderer,

185
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,350
and going on about being a "good person" right now?

186
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:40,770

187
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:44,130
In Sook! It was you!

188
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,640
Do you know how worried I was?

189
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,730
Woo Cheon, where in the world did you two go?

190
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,170
Unnie...

191
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:13,590
I was scared that I would never see you again.

192
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,500
- Are you okay? 
 - Yeah.

193
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,030
I am going to move forward.

194
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,890
Good job.

195
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,180
I missed you.

196
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,960
But did you get caught?

197
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,180
No... Have you been well?

198
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,270
Yes, somewhat.

199
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,220
- Are you satisfied? 
 - Yes.

200
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,020
Yes?

201
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:13,250
Yes? Have you seen the public opinion?

202
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,730
My prediction was correct down to the last inch.

203
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:20,540
The public is criticizing us for changing the investigation all of a sudden, due to not being able to catch the runaways.

204
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,000
- I predicted that. 
 - You predicted it?

205
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,560
They don't even believe that it wasn't a serial killing.

206
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,540
They're bursting at the seams with conspiracies about the police covering up the case.

207
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,230
I will announce the accurate investigation results shortly.

208
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,560
- What do you have? 
 - Pardon?

209
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,800
Aren't you causing problems because you have something up your sleeve?

210
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,100
Let's say that you're right about the third murder, but how will you explain the first and second?

211
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,540
I will find definite evidence and then let you know.

212
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,910
You have to.

213
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,960
If not, we're all getting wiped out.

214
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:58,210
I don't want to die with you. I'll give you three days.

215
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,640
Ma'am.

216
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,910
Did she say something else?

217
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:18,120
You sure did put a lot of stuff in your hair!

218
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,350
About two containers.

219
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:25,580
You guys got caught in one go.

220
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,250
What do we do now?

221
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,820
It's all right.

222
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,660
At any rate, because of the serial killings and whatnot,

223
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,220
all of the patients who were going to leave left.

224
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,720
These people are all family.

225
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,450
We will keep your secret, comrade.

226
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,740
That's not right!

227
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:53,780
Are we in the middle of a war? Talking about comrade...

228
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,570
This is a place for people who are dying to spend their time peacefully.

229
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:00,470
What are you suggesting we do after hiding two murderers?

230
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,970
No, the detectives said that they did not kill them.

231
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,590
Then, why are they hiding?

232
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:08,690
Right? Why are they hiding?

233
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:11,280
Hey, stop causing people harm and just leave.

234
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,330
Get caught, or run away, I don't care!

235
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,950
I'm going to report you, anyway.

236
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,080
You're going to report them?

237
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,350
The third case is...

238
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,350
What's this?

239
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,480
The Guseong gang was involved in the second murder.

240
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,930
Koo Ji Pyo ordered the murder.

241
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:42,100
- Who? 
 - We need to catch Shin Tae Il first.

242
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,460
He's someone who can give a concrete testimony.

243
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,080
He's also someone who was in contact with Koo Ji Pyo directly.

244
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,100
Wait a second, I'm still not catching up.

245
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,830
Catch up, without reporting to Jo Ji Ah.

246
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,280
Ah, so I'm two-timing from now on.

247
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,050
Taking care of Jo Ji Ah and you.

248
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:06,330
We need to get the evidence and break it all at once, to have a chance of winning.

249
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,250

250
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,800
So it was you?

251
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,640
You're the one who broke your promise first, even though I did what I was told.

252
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,590
What can you achieve with that video alone?

253
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,810
It doesn't have anything to do with the murder.

254
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,690
Park Du Jin, the second...

255
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:52,310
you asked Park Seung Sun to kill him, and you are the one who killed Park Seung Sun.

256
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,150
Park Du Jin? Why?

257
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,820
He's a bad guy.

258
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,870
 He's the guy who the public is cursing the most right now. Are you not mad?

259
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:02,710
 I... I... I am mad!

260
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:06,620
 So kill him.

261
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,830
Park Seung Sun?

262
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:16,820
Are you saying that Park Seung Sun gave this to you before going? Why would he?

263
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,320
He must have known that you were going to kill him.

264
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,670
If he knew, he wouldn't have gone.

265
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,860
But why is the Guseong gang stuck to you?

266
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,460
- What do you want? 
 - Money.

267
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,350
Yeah, it's always money.

268
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,210
I guess you don't care about things like the truth, either.

269
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,650
Give me five sheets. There's no time.

270
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:46,090
I'll send you the location, so you drop off the cash.

271
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,870
Instead, I have a condition, as well.

272
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,900
Hand over Min Woo Cheon and Pyo In Sook's whereabouts.

273
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:57,370
You would know, since you saved him.

274
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:02,830
The police announced that they were entering a total reinvestigation.

275
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:07,170
If things go that way, you, me, all of us will get caught up in it.

276
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,280
This is your last chance.

277
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:14,420
Since people still believe that it's a serial murder,

278
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,220
we need to move forward now.

279
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,420
As long as Pyo In Sook and Min Woo Cheon are caught,

280
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,250
the situation will end no matter what.

281
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,370
Think it over.

282
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,200
You can't tell anyone that I'm here.

283
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,470
Until when?

284
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,450
Unnie...

285
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,900
Are secrets... bad?

286
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,020
It depends on the situation,

287
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,290
but wouldn't they be a bit heavy?

288
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:57,030
Because you have to cover it up alone.

289
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:02,120
Yeah, you're right. It's heavy.

290
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,230
But... I think I'm happy these days.

291
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:11,050
- Yeah? 
 - Since my mom is by my side.

292
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,860
That's a relief.

293
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:22,160
But... I'm scared that this happiness will break.

294
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,990
So, it is a secret.

295
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,550
It's heavy.

296
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,530
 I did it. I came by because I was worried about San Ah,

297
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:39,050
 but that person was collapsed on the ground. His eyes opened suddenly.

298
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:43,030
 I was so scared, so I strangled him.

299
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:47,800
 I kept putting in more strength without realizing it, so he died.

300
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,570
Ms. Yeo Wool, let's go out and play.

301
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,150
Let's play that game from last time.

302
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,380
You're not going to the academy?

303
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,710
I don't want to go today.

304
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,460
Why?

305
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,310
I just don't feel like it. I don't want to go today.

306
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:34,680
If you're going to do what you want like that, go home and do it, not here.

307
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,560
What?

308
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,640
If you're going to act stubborn and spoiled,

309
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,460
go and do it at your house, not here!

310
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,930
Why are you acting like that to a child?

311
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:56,080
Ji Hoo, go outside for a second.

312
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,860
Do you avoid poop because it's scary? No, you avoid it because it's dirty.

313
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,630
Go outside first.

314
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,670
Why are you treating a child that way?

315
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:22,570
You know yourself that she's only following you because Young Ji passed.

316
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,360
That's why I'm acting like that!

317
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,530
What do you know about how much she's been struggling after Young Ji left?

318
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,490
She still cries herself to sleep.

319
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,470
But if she gets attached to me,

320
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:37,640
Young Ji and Sung Hae left, when I leave too, what is she going to do?

321
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:42,540
Even if that's the case, you shouldn't treat a kid like that.

322
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,860
You know, don't you?

323
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:06,510
Sung Hae said goodbye before she left.

324
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:12,160
You know why she did that, right?

325
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,120
Look at this.

326
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,120
Between friends here, it's okay to die.

327
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,920
She made such a huge fuss before she left, then died alone.

328
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,750
 What? What is it?

329
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,230
 Do you see something?

330
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,970
 Someone is dying, but...

331
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,790
I hate it.

332
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:15,310
I hate it all.

333
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,730
Relying and depending on the people here,

334
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:23,870
laughing together and whatnot... I'm scared of all of it, now.

335
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,890
I don't want to do it anymore.

336
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:34,620
Hey, we're all going to die anyway, how can you hold on so tightly?

337
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:40,080
 I am this hospice's hope.

338
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,940
 What's the point of that?

339
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:47,620
 Empty hope? That will only be more devastating.

340
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,680
 Does empty hope exist?

341
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,630
 To sick patients, it's just

342
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:59,700
 strength to get past now.

343
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,510
What about it?

344
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,840
I'm doing that.

345
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,140
I'm going to keep doing it.

346
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,960
I'm going to hold on.

347
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,230
I'm going to hold tight.

348
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,810
What about it?

349
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:23,810
That's what I want to do, while I'm alive.

350
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,560
That's all that I can do.

351
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:23,010
I fall asleep easily these days.

352
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:27,370
I'm not in pain, and the aching has decreased.

353
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:29,540
Isn't that good?

354
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:33,920
The strange thing is, if you're sleeping more,

355
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:39,280
and the aching decreases, you're supposed to be closer to death.

356
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,440
What?

357
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,000
They say that those are deathbed symptoms.

358
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,360
Unnie.

359
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:55,590
Unnie, what do you mean?

360
00:27:55,590 --> 00:28:00,840
Honestly.... my heart was really heavy.

361
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,840
I don't remember, but if I said that on that day,

362
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,130
and led us to go there...

363
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:14,380
To be honest, I was really angry at the time.

364
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:21,410
That's what the end of my life looked like... There was no escape...

365
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:24,130
So I must have exploded.

366
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:29,110
That thing happened because of my internal anger,

367
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,350
so you guys ended up like this...

368
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:33,030
It's not like that.

369
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,900
Don't feel guilty.

370
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,670
Then you should say who did it. Why won't you say it?

371
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,720
We started it together.

372
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,550
So we should know, too!

373
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,970
 I said that I would protect her...

374
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,390
 I told her that I would protect her...

375
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:56,270
 Are you saying that we should kill him?

376
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:59,920
 If you could save one person by killing another...

377
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:04,330
 What about taking just one person?

378
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:12,920
Unnie, what's wrong? Are you okay?

379
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,740
Shouldn't Kang Se Yeon go to the hospital?

380
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,780
She said that she wanted to be here, that she wanted to wrap things up here.

381
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,490
That's why she came back.

382
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:32,620
I think that her symptoms of delirium are coming.

383
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,150
Her cognitive functions will temporarily falter,

384
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:39,480
so she can't differentiate times and places. She'll start seeing things

385
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,440
and hearing things.

386
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:49,790
Sung Mi Do's hemoptysis symptoms are getting more severe as well. Pyo In Sook also...

387
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:56,040
All three of them are in a bad condition?

388
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:02,330

389
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,880
Ever since some time, I keep seeing visions.

390
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,590
But I like that.

391
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,580
What do you see?

392
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,290
The three of us are there.

393
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:25,840
But it doesn't feel like a vision, but a memory.

394
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,760
Like something that happened long before we met here.

395
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,580
I keep seeing it right before my eyes.

396
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,310
What are the three of us doing?

397
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:39,410
We just... go shopping, and drink coffee,

398
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:43,390
walk along the street, and even go on drives.

399
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:45,660
So it's nothing big.

400
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:49,940
You're right, it's nothing big.

401
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,160
But I never had a chance to do that.

402
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,640
Let's do it.

403
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,900
We can just do it.

404
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,880
Let's go.

405
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,860
I... can't go out.

406
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,440
How else should we cover you up?

407
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,370
- Try these. 
 - Huh?

408
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,160
Take a look at this.

409
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,070
Woah, you look so much prettier covered up like this.

410
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:37,700
Unni.

411
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,860
You can't tell who you are.

412
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,850
That's good.

413
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,800
This is so cute.

414
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,220
Oh gosh!

415
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,340
How long do we have to wait and watch?

416
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,370
Maybe it's too bright. Let's see.

417
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:54,400
This is the one. This!

418
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,590
It's so pretty!

419
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:01,370
- How does it look? 
 - It's so pretty.

420
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:03,660
I think I'm okay as is.

421
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,570
Try this one. And this.

422
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:13,670
- What about this? 
 - And this?

423
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,030
It's pretty.

424
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,390
It's really pretty.

425
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,870
Pretty.

426
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:47,180
It's all right. Nobody's looking at you.

427
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:51,080
They're all just looking at me.

428
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,700
No way.

429
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,450
I'm serious! I'm introverted.

430
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:07,650
If you're introverted, who in the world would be extroverted?

431
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:10,420
You can't judge a book by its cover.

432
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:14,290
Don't you know about 90% of what I say is complete nonsense?

433
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:17,510
Though I seem bright externally,

434
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:22,210
if you pay close attention to me, you'll realize I don't talk about myself much.

435
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,750
What about you?

436
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,050
What are you guys talking about?

437
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,480
Don't you know what MBTI's are?

438
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,420
- No. 
 - No way.

439
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:32,890
You've been listening this whole time, without understanding this conversation?

440
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,110
Then talk about it.

441
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:37,130
- About what? 
 - About yourself.

442
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:40,610
So suddenly? What about myself?

443
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,910
Your love life.

444
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,930
Gosh.

445
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,800
Love?

446
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,850
When it comes to love...

447
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:00,330
When you love someone,

448
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:05,170
you probably feel so complete and safe when you're with them,

449
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,790
am I right?

450
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,610
Do you feel that way?

451
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,380
Yeah.

452
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:15,380
I feel anxious.

453
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:21,040
Strangely, the more I like someone, the more anxious I become.

454
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,910
Are you scared they'll leave you?

455
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,760
Maybe.

456
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,320
Here.

457
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:49,370
Were you hurt by Yeo Wool earlier?

458
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,300
No.

459
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:55,050
Yeo Wool is the one who's hurt.

460
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:01,310
Mister,

461
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:08,670
how do you endure when someone you love is no longer by you?

462
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,480
You can't.

463
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:20,860
If you try to endure it, you become unable to.

464
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:25,850
Then... what do you do?

465
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:32,270
When confronted with sadness or pain,

466
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:38,450
don't resist and just push through.

467
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,150
But I'm not so sure myself...

468
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:49,120
if that'll be possible.

469
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:37,930
What's this? Are you going somewhere?

470
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:41,140
You haven't even been feeling well recently.

471
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,090
I'm going home.

472
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:46,700
Home? Why home, so suddenly?

473
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,600
Unni, what are you planning on doing?

474
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,510
What's going on? Aren't you getting a divorce?

475
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,710
I'll be back.

476
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,680
Hello.

477
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,730
Are you ready?

478
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,760
Why are you here? Why are you taking her?

479
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,040
My mother-in-law keeps looking for Se Yeon.

480
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,790
Of course, she'd look for her! To work her like a slave again.

481
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,120
Why are you going there?

482
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,470
Se Yeon is really sick.

483
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,580
I'm aware.

484
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,920
Let's go.

485
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,060
Where?

486
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,620
One moment please.

487
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,870
Team Leader, Koo Ji Pyo's car is in transit right now.

488
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:50,580
- To where? 
 - Hospice.

489
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,870
Yes. Thank you.

490
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,490
What is this? Have they made amends?

491
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:06,880
People do that before they're about to die.

492
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,500
I love you.

493
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:16,600
Why are you saying that?

494
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:21,310
I thought about it, and I never said those words.

495
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:23,970
Forget it.

496
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:27,740
I've never said those words to Ji Pyo.

497
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,300
Oh.

498
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,790
I don't think he's said it to me either. Has he?

499
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:37,760
Aren't you supposed to remember things like that?

500
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,520
Yeah.

501
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:48,320
Oppa.

502
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,970
Right now? You're here?

503
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,250
We meet again.

504
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,730
Oppa!

505
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,890
What brings you here again?

506
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,560
She has a reason to be here.

507
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,190
Not at all. The location of the picnic.

508
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:34,030
- Excuse me? 
 - Reservations had originally been made for a different location,

509
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,490
but the location changed suddenly, the day before the picnic.

510
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:39,770
The Head Nun said this was suggested by you.

511
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:43,160
- So? 
 - That's where Park Du Jin was murdered.

512
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:48,050
Hey. What's this nonsense? Why are you roping him in again?

513
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:55,450
I only recommended that location because there was a nice inn there.

514
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:59,360
Our company is in the midst of sponsoring the hospice.

515
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,050
You're here?

516
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:07,170
I had been planning on contacting you sometime soon.

517
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:09,700
As you're aware, because of the Moss Flower serialâ€”

518
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,200
I guess it's not a serial murder case anymore.

519
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,890
But because of that, we've been losing so many patients,

520
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:19,750
that I've been losing weight along with it.

521
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:24,240
That's why I was wondering, in regards to LE Group's sponsorship of our hospiceâ€”

522
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,570
Sponsor? He's someone who broke off the engagement through the news.

523
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:30,310
Why would he provide any more support?

524
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:33,410
What's happening with the marriage, huh?

525
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:35,840
Are you really not going to do it?

526
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,000
Did you really dump our Mi Do?

527
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,750
No. That's why he's here. He wouldn't be so shameless.

528
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:47,090
Cut it out!

529
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,020
Is he really all that because he's rich?

530
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,770
 We're just trying to watch out for you.

531
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:56,350
Your dad?

532
00:40:56,350 --> 00:41:00,410
Yes. He released the article on his own.

533
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:05,210
I guess he felt burdened by the company getting involved in the case.

534
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:07,140
I see.

535
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:11,910
I'm sorry I couldn't contact you sooner.

536
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:14,070
Were you in lots of pain?

537
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,140
Yes.

538
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,530
My body keeps breaking down.

539
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:22,320
What did you mean earlier?

540
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:26,750
You said that detective had a reason to be at the hospice.

541
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,540
Oppa, do you love me?

542
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:35,730
Huh? What do you mean?

543
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:39,840
I just... want to hear you say it.

544
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,890
- Yes. 
 - Huh?

545
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:44,000
I do love you.

546
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:52,280
If we catch the criminal and this all ends,

547
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,190
can we really get married?

548
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:58,110
Just wait a bit more. I'll do whatever it takes to end it.

549
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,980
Can't we just get married?

550
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,700
I'm starting to get scared.

551
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:08,480
As long as you're by my side,

552
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,350
I think everything would be all right.

553
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:22,590
- What about you? 
 - Huh?

554
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:27,100
Do you love me?

555
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:32,690
Regardless of what kind of person I may be?

556
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,960
If... What if I were a bad person?

557
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:46,660
Why would you be?

558
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:50,530
Would you love me, if you knew the real me?

559
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:53,690
I've had such thoughts since I was little.

560
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:57,090
I thought that whenever I saw my dad.

561
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,300
Welcome.

562
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,800
Are you Se Yeon?

563
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:26,200
- Yes. 
 - I've been so curious

564
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,120
ever since our Young Chan told me he was bringing home his wife.

565
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:35,580
Perhaps it's because he talked so much about you. You seem like someone I know.

566
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:42,300
Young Chan talks about you so much.

567
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:46,540
You're competent, smart, and pretty.

568
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:50,690
How is she? Don't you think so?

569
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:52,700
She is.

570
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:03,620
No, no. Se Yeon is allergic to peanuts.

571
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:06,100
She can't eat that.

572
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,640
You two will have a wonderful life.

573
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,630
- You think so? 
 - They say a couple will be happy if the man loves the woman more.

574
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,440
Look at Young Chan.

575
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:26,700
He's just looking at you, ever since you got here.

576
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:32,310
Enjoy your food.

577
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,020
Thank you.

578
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:03,620
Thank you.

579
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,740
The reason Koo Ji Pyo started all of this

580
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:14,710
is in that video?

581
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:17,960
And Shin Tae Il has that video?

582
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,630
After the first murder went awry and an investigation started,

583
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:24,490
he feared the case would get bigger.

584
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:27,660
He insisted In Sook turn herself in, but I blocked that.

585
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,880
That's why he tried to kill you,

586
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:35,160
and fabricated the Moss Flower serial murder.

587
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,700
But now that Park Seung Sun is dead, we lack evidence.

588
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,650
Is Mi Do not involved at all?

589
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:43,300
She isn't. She doesn't know anything.

590
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:48,240
Did you hide the truth to protect Sung Mi Do?

591
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,230
You know where Shin Tae Il is, don't you?

592
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:54,600
What'll happen to him if he gets caught?

593
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,970
All the murders Narae Cleaners is involved in will get a separate investigation.

594
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:59,390
What'll happen to Woo Cheon?

595
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:01,630
You accepted the request to kill Ha Young Geun.

596
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:03,900
If Shin Tae Il testifies, you won't be able to evade charges.

597
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:08,120
No. Woo Cheon didn't kill him.

598
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,200
It may be possible to reduce his sentence.

599
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,350
I looked into the Narae Cleaning account book,

600
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:18,330
and it seems those who requested murders were quite influential.

601
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:20,630
If those people don't come clean,

602
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:26,550
it could be quite difficult to prove the murders were committed.

603
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:30,880

604
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,500
 Let's meet. Where are you?

605
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,840
What are you trying to do?

606
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,770
Don't do anything.

607
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:47,870
If he doesn't get caught and we don't say anything,

608
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:49,750
we can get out of this somehow.

609
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:53,100
You're doing this to protect San Ah.

610
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,120
You're going to keep it a secret until the end.

611
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:01,100
If we want to prove it wasn't a serial murder, we have to tie Koo Ji Pyo to this case somehow.

612
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:04,000
We can' stay hidden here forever.

613
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:18,110
Why are you hesitating? Just expose Min Woo Cheon's whereabouts! Let's take the money and end this!

614
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,530
Dammit.

615
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:26,400
Hyungnim!

616
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,240
I told you to not walk around in large groups as if you're thugs.

617
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,620
Detectives... Detectives are snooping around this case.

618
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:35,970
-  What? 
 - They...

619
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:39,420
They have Narae Cleaning's entire account book!

620
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:44,710
We need to move fast, before they find evidence.

621
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:47,140
If the police expose this before we do, we can't get the money.

622
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:51,620
Deny everything for now and buy us some time. Expose things when I say so.

623
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,230
Find some people to take the blow, too.

624
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:55,260
Yes, Sir.

625
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,350
Min Woo Cheon landed the first punch.

626
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:04,060
Huh?

627
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:08,860
How else would the police have gotten the account book?

628
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:11,460
You said Min Woo Cheon had that.

629
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,790
This bastard.

630
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:18,320
Why would he ask to meet you now, of all times?

631
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,020
Don't you smell something suspicious?

632
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:26,130
We have to move quickly, before Koo Ji Pyo changes his mind.

633
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:27,850
Aren't you going to talk to Woo Cheon directly?

634
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:29,340
Why are you asking me?

635
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:32,970
Why are you questioning me?

636
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:34,530
I always have. Should I stop?

637
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:38,530
I don't have time to joke around. Just do what I ask you to.

638
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:42,770
Found it. Namhyeon City, Sungwoon Road.

639
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:45,570
He's at Morning Light Hospice.

640
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,830

641
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:53,630
The furniture here is not great.

642
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:58,130
I like the white, modern background

643
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:01,920
but want the furniture to be more antique.

644
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,780
How's that?

645
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:08,550
Are you okay?

646
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,330
- Oh no. 
 - I'm okay.

647
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:16,390
Wait a minute.

648
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:33,830
I'm going to grab some clothes from my car.

649
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:06,480
 I know where he is.

650
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,770
 I'll tell you where he is, so put the money there first.

651
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,310
 Do you need to do this? You're already loaded.

652
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:17,670
 How will you have time to study, managing this?

653
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:20,200
 This pays too well to pass up.

654
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,900
 10 billion. Hurry and upload it.

655
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:30,290

656
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:32,880
It's all over now.

657
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,970
How do you feel?

658
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:38,380
I'm not sure.

659
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:43,180
I feel like I've finally found my place after taking a long detour.

660
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,470
I didn't go that day either.

661
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:51,270
To the airport.

662
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:53,780
I didn't go either.

663
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:58,770
So you're not the only one that ran away.

664
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:01,520
But even as you're running away, you're bound to take some type of path.

665
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,740
On that path, I met you again.

666
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:08,070
You're right.

667
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:13,230
There are things that we know now

668
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:15,900
only because we went down that path.

669
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:20,930
You know, I'm pretty slow.

670
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:24,380
But...

671
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,570
I'm too late now, aren't I?

672
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:30,370
Not at all.

673
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,110

674
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:51,870

675
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,850
Are you okay?

676
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,320
I'll go call the doctor.

677
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:05,440
Don't. I'm okay.

678
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,330
Let's...

679
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:20,550
Let's read through these notes here.

680
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,800
Read it.

681
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:33,930
You first.

682
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,920
"Make sure Hye Jin pays back the 10 million she borrowed from you."

683
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,250
"Get it back."

684
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,440
- "We are beggars." 
 - Huh?

685
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,810
"Luther wrote this before he died."

686
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:53,320
- Who's Luther. 
 - Some German guy. 
  (T/N: quote is by Martin Luther, a German priest and theologian. Lutherans follow his teachings)

687
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:56,000
You think I'm stupid?

688
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,390
Yes, a bit.

689
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:02,470
Next.

690
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:20,530
"I love you. I love you. I love you.

691
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,530
I love you."

692
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:26,110
Liar.

693
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:46,690

694
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:05,040
"I want to live."

695
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,280
"I want to live."

696
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,220
I want to live.

697
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:57,440
I want to live.

698
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:16,330
 You didn't know that gangs run that organization?

699
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:17,530
 What are you suspecting?

700
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:19,640
 It's not a suspicion, but a question. For now.

701
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:23,930
 I wish that person were a good person.

702
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:27,390
 Would you love me, if you knew the real me?

703
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:27,190
 You know this guy, don't you?

704
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:52,440
Arrest them immediately.

705
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,800
Yes, understood.

706
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,790
What's going on?

707
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:02,060
We received a tip this morning. The information was leaked to prosecution and reporters, as well.

708
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:05,680
- The suspect of the second murderâ€” 
 - It's been settled now.

709
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:14,380
Goodness.

710
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:50,340
- They're here. 
  - Found in the basement.

711
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:08,330
What's going on?

712
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,680
This is Morning Light Hospice.

713
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:17,560
The police were dispatched here after receiving a tip that the two wanted murder suspects,

714
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:21,880
Pyo In Sook and Min Woo Cheon, were hiding here at the hospice.

715
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:27,080
- They're not here. 
 - We only have a few questions.

716
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,680
I'm a patient here.

717
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:36,810
They're coming!

718
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:44,310
In Sook, are you okay?

719
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:46,920
In Sook!

720
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:50,590
Stay still! You're making things more difficult.

721
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:54,000
Wait. Please just wait a little bit.

722
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,180
She's sick.

723
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:58,820
- Let her take some medicineâ€” 
 - We cannot allow that.

724
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:01,300
Detective, please.

725
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,630
Get out of my way!

726
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:10,770
Unni. Unni!

727
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:16,120
Did you just push her? Are you okay?

728
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:26,150
Unni! Unni, are you okay?

729
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:28,390
- Unni! 
 - Move!

730
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:32,140
What are you doing? They didn't do it!

731
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:34,990
- It's not them! 
 - We'll investigate that one on our own.

732
00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:36,810
- Move! 
 - Block him.

733
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:40,420
Get out of my way! Move!

734
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:42,330
Unni!

735
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:45,300
What are you doing? Block them!

736
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,630
Get out of our way!

737
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:04,180
Move! Get out of my way!

738
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:42,120
How do you feel right now? Do you acknowledge the things you've done?

739
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:45,030
Why did you hide in hospice while you were wanted?

740
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:46,680
Is it true that you were involved in a contract murder?

741
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:51,200
Are you the culprit behind the Moss Flower case?

742
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:59,760
Why did you place the Moss Flower on your victims? Do you admit your wrongdoings?

743
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:02,810
What was your motive for murder? How do you feel right now?

744
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:04,310
Did you really murder them because they were bad people?

745
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:05,790
Why were you in hiding?

746
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:10,050
Do you knowledge the accusations? Who ordered you to murder?

747
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:23,350

748
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:29,900
â™«  The fluttering petals. Does it make sense?  â™«

749
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,260
 San Ah reminds me of me. I wanted to protect her.

750
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:34,380
 I couldn't protect anyone.

751
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:37,610
 I think I was able to protect the life I had thrown away.

752
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:39,430
 Because I met you.

753
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:41,800
 How could you do this to me?!

754
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:45,110
 I love my baby too much to do that.

755
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:48,300
 We can only link Koo Ji Pyo to this case if the Narae Cleaning contract murders

756
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,680
 are proven to be true.

757
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:52,030
 For that to happen, Min Woo Cheon needs to take responsibility.

758
01:01:52,030 --> 01:01:54,720
 Let's have the most fantastical wedding in the world.

759
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,520
 If any burden becomes too heavy for you to bear, just let it go.

760
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,390
 - I'm going to find that video. 
 - You promised to be by my side when I died.

761
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:03,160
 Let's run away to the ocean. The three of us.

762
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:06,200
 If tomorrow comes...

763
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:11,260
â™«  I don't know how you feel  â™«

764
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,750
