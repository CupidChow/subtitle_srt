1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:08,550

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:16,980

3
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,320
What's with you? Are you okay?

4
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,720
Should I call someone? Will you be okay?

5
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:42,770
I'm really sorry. I'll settle it.

6
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,950
Did you scrub a lot? All the customers are only looking for you.

7
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,850
A young woman's strength is good.

8
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,260
Why? Were you up all night again?

9
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,480
Your face is so haggard!

10
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,470
- Why do you always bring that, do you have kids? 
 - Yes.

11
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,290
Really?  Do you really have kids?

12
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,520
- No. 
 - No, right?

13
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,920
 I thought it was true.

14
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,140
Here, our ace.

15
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,230
- Thank you. 
 - Drink this and keep up the good work!

16
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,350
Hey! Know your place.

17
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:06,660
If you scrub all night long, then do we play around?

18
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,090
Why are you acting like this? There are customers here, stop.

19
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,220
- Let's go. 
 - This is too much, right.

20
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,790
Knowing that we are running out of money, you are persistently eating up all the money.

21
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,110
This young woman is smiling softly. Do you even feel sorry?

22
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,790
- I am exploding inside with heat... 
 - I knew she was like that.

23
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,590
What are you staring at? Do you want to punch me?

24
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,030
It's enough Unnie, let's go. Come on.

25
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,890
They say the strength of a starving demon is good and call for me. What can I do?

26
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:37,090
- Huh? 
 - Oh my! You're crazy!

27
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,760
- This rude girl! 
 - No, wait.

28
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,820
What are you doing, right now?!

29
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,920
- Let go of me. 
 - Let's talk.

30
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,640
Hey, don't you know who your superiors are?

31
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,170
Are you happy now?

32
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,520
- Do you think you're everything just because you're young? 
 -  Wait, wait. Please stop.

33
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,100
- You rude jerk! You have no manners! 
 - Please, be patient.

34
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,890
- Kid, let's eat. 
  - All right.

35
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,670
Aren't the black bean noodles yesterday's leftovers?

36
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,330
Did you sprinkle the chili flakes on them?

37
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,820
Don't complain a lot when eating.

38
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,540
Hey, but...

39
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,310
What is the meaning of "signature"?

40
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:37,330
If this place gets redeveloped, it's going to be the "Signature Palace Apartments."

41
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,840
Gosh, before I die I want to buy an apartment.

42
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,480
That's good for you, too, right?

43
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,510
But it's weird to live in close quarters like a matchbox.

44
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,790
I don't know if people don't find it suffocating.

45
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:57,250
Even if you talk a little, people next door might hear. Right?

46
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,990
Grandma, my ears are hurting.

47
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:06,250
- Your ears hurt? 
 - You talking without even breathing. Please stop.

48
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,790
It's a habit.

49
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,260
I want water.

50
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,230
Keep eating and then drink some water. I'll be right back.

51
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,790
What is that?

52
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,280
What do you mean?

53
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,320
With difficulty, I found these tangerine peels and dried them.

54
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,390
- Find them? You had to find those? 
 - Don't pick a fight.

55
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:38,560
If you boil dried tangerine peels and drink, they say it's good for your body.

56
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,140
I saw it on TV.

57
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,360
Your father. He deposited 1,200,000 won.

58
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,810
Why do you keep saying that?

59
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:05,500
1,200,000 won in three years? Then 400,000 won per year? 
 (T/N ~$1,200 and $400)

60
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:11,560
- Grandma, aren't you mad? 
 - Why would I be mad? He's my son.

61
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,770
Find another job.

62
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:22,100
Why are you a body scrubber, such a young woman?

63
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,150
- What else? 
 - Something other than body scrubbing.

64
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,310
- There is nothing I can do other than that. 
 - There is!

65
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,420
Drink up, it's good for your health.

66
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,420
It tastes all right. Oddly throwing a fit.

67
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,730
What are you doing? What's wrong?

68
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,890
- I feel sick because of that water. 
 - Are you going somewhere?

69
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,330
- Are you going out? 
 - To buy bottled water.

70
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,700
- Instead of buying plain water, buy some soda.

71
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,500
Buy something that has something in it.

72
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,090
That girl. Geez.

73
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,990
 Help me!

74
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,730
Save me!

75
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,260
Please save me!

76
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,430
- Please save me! 
 - Save what? You crazy kid!

77
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,260
I told you not to touch my mobile phone. My phone!

78
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,390
Save me!

79
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,400
Hey! Damn it!

80
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,460
Why are you running so fast?

81
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,030
I told you not to touch my phone. My phone!

82
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,100
- Unnie, save me! 
 - What do you mean, "save me"? Damn!

83
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,030
Give that to me!

84
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,790
Look at you!

85
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,770
You must be crazy!

86
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,190
Lady, that's mine.

87
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,430
That's mine, please give it back.

88
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:39,470
I said that's mine.

89
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:43,060
What are you doing? Ha San Ah, come here.

90
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,690
Lady, just go. Ha San Ah, let's go.

91
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,990
- What are you doing? I'm her dad. 
 - So what?

92
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,200
- What? 
 - So what if you are her dad.

93
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,290
- I'm her dad, so just go! 
 - Even so, I'm not leaving.

94
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:57,430
- Are you crazy? What are you doing? 
 - It's all right. It's all right.

95
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,030
Hey, Ha San Ah. Hey!

96
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,030
Let's run!

97
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,520
Hey, who do you think you are?

98
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,420
What's with you?!

99
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,990
Unnie, are you okay?

100
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,490
Go. Just go.

101
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,770
Hey, Stop there.

102
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,630
We tried to get away. With difficulty, we moved here.

103
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,560
The police gave him our address because he is my dad.

104
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,700
- I'm sorry. 
 - I'm sorry.

105
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,200
- Why are you sorry? 
 - I couldn't hear you.

106
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,700
- What? 
 - I said I couldn't hear you.

107
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:58,790
I cannot hear well. I can hear well from a closer distance.

108
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,390
But even so, I can still tell by the shapes of the mouth.

109
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,930
Did you learn to...

110
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,270
read lips? 
 - No.

111
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,600
I do it spontaneously.

112
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,770
That one time I was scared,

113
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,600
when I couldn't hear anything.

114
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,830
- About one year ago, you and your mom had just moved in, right? 
 - Yes.

115
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:30,800
Was it sometime after that? The day your dad had come back?

116
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,440
Oh, you had a dad. Maybe he is here after a long time.

117
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,530
That's good. Even so,

118
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:43,030
it must have been that night. I passed by and saw...

119
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:47,040
the shadow go back and forth.

120
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,770
"Are they excitedly having a party?"

121
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:54,320
"Are they dancing?" I thought, and left.

122
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:01,340
I didn't hear it. The screaming.

123
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,870
The screaming for life.

124
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:09,870
The next day, when the ambulance came by, that's when I knew.

125
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,530
The meaning of that shadow.

126
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,970
I didn't hear it well that's why you almost died.

127
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:21,730
Since that day, I was scared that something might happen to you.

128
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,190
That day I knew,

129
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,730
when you can't hear...

130
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,180
you can't protect anyone.

131
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,060
- Where is your mom? 
 - She ran away.

132
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,070
Leaving you?

133
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:49,360
She might come back. If Mom is there, Dad gets wilder.

134
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,430
It might be better if my mom doesn't come.

135
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:59,130
It might be better if I die alone.

136
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:05,250
Mom said that one day we will die at Dad's hand.

137
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,790
No.

138
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,410
I'll protect you.

139
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,410
Let's go.

140
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,740
Unnie, are you okay?

141
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,510
 Are you okay? Get it together.

142
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,500
 Unnie!

143
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,360
I wasn't able to say bye to mom.

144
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,210
You're not going.

145
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:43,260
I'll go, I'll see her.

146
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,610
- I'll say bye. 
 - I said no.

147
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,630
- Where did she go? 
 - I told you, she went far away.

148
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,880
We'll be living separately from now.

149
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,750
Please let me say goodbye, please.

150
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,230
If you keep acting like this, I'm going to leave you here and go.

151
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,480
Where are you going?

152
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,930
Wow, that stubborn girl, really!

153
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,020
As you can see here, this is a tumor.

154
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,040
It's about 5 centimeters and right under the skull,

155
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,070
but the range metastasized into normal cells.

156
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:47,070
The problem is, it's not benign, it's malignant.

157
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,710
Since it's in a state where we can't do removal surgery.

158
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,940
Goodbye.

159
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,320
I wasn't able to say bye.

160
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,590
Well... You must be shocked.

161
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,360
Wait a moment.

162
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,320
Yes, I would like a refund.

163
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,550
Yes, please take care of it immediately.

164
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,820
So how much...

165
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,980
It's not definite, but probably a few months.

166
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,570
- How much of a refund did you get? 
 - What?

167
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,810
- How much? 
 - Well...

168
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,630
- I asked how much. 
 - 1,200,000 won.

169
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,530
1,200,000 won... (~$1,200)

170
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,920
1,200,000.

171
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,490
1,200,000.

172
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,250
Excuse me.

173
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:42,940
 The symptoms must have shown up quite late, but you'll show signs of absent-mindedness,

174
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:48,940
 things like headaches, or blurry vision, those kinds of symptoms.

175
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,740
No! Isn't everything covered with 30 thousand won?

176
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,050
I told you that the massage alone was 30 thousand won and that the skin scrubbing was separate.

177
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,520
Then you shouldn't call it a set!

178
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,490
The skin scrubbing during the massage counts as a set!

179
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:22,950
- You need to give me 10 thousand more won. 
 - Whatever.

180
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,020
I won't.

181
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,330
Seriously!

182
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,670
Gosh! Hey!

183
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:33,390
Let go. Let go, will you?

184
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:39,010
Even if you do this, I won't give it to you; even if I die, I won't.

185
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,150
Even if you die...

186
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,490
you won't pay? Even if you die?

187
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,910
Y-Yeah, I won't.

188
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,870
What are you doing?

189
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:58,110
What?

190
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,390
She's a shameless robber! I asked where the manager was!

191
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,300
Oh my, there's been an accident.

192
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,340
Oh my! There's a ruckus at the supermarket!

193
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,560
It's an accident.

194
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,450
-  Oh my god! 
 -  Oh my gosh!

195
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:33,980
- God! Someone should do something. 
 - What to do?

196
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,530
- Oh my god! 
 - Look at that!

197
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,360
This isn't somewhere they can bring cars.

198
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,220
They shouldn't have come in a car.

199
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,930
 No way!

200
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,880
What happened?

201
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,020
The driver set the transmission gear to drive, turned off the car, and left.

202
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,140
- The parking brake wasn't even activated. 
 - He must be crazy.

203
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,030
Exactly where has the driver gone when someone has died?

204
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,200
Don't take pictures.

205
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,020
You can't take pictures, go inside.

206
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,860
Go inside.

207
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,980
Please don't take pictures.

208
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,170
Please keep going. Pass by.

209
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:04,150

210
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:12,150
You drink one too, In Sook.

211
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:15,210
Thank you.

212
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,160
It really is a needless death.

213
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:24,420
Why are you drinking it all of a sudden? You should take it for your child.

214
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:31,070
I'll be quitting.

215
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,530
Ah, because of that woman earlier.

216
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:38,360
Even if the boss knows, they won't do anything. Don't worry.

217
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,180
Thank you for everything.

218
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,130
In Sook!

219
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,840
Thank you.

220
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,270
Th-The car's owner?

221
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,810
It's a stolen vehicle.

222
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:17,090
Oh, yeah, yeah... as expected.

223
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,080
Please scrap this immediately. I made some calls while trying to get the location.

224
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,530
O-O-Okay.

225
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:31,420
 Do you see the stall in front of the supermarket? If you look inside, the item will be there.

226
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,730
 Go inside. Go inside!

227
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,420
But that guy,

228
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,550
how did you know that he was going around looking for drugs?

229
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:03,650
I mean, he was selling to minors and then scratching relentlessly, this jerk.

230
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:08,750
Now that neighborhood's drug supply should be cut off.

231
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,120
No matter how you think about it, it's quite ingenious.

232
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,060
What are you going to do next time?

233
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,030
So that it doesn't hurt.

234
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,020
If you don't know, it doesn't hurt.

235
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,670
If you die and you don't know, it doesn't hurt.

236
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,860
Watching death coming is what's scary.

237
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,690
Death hurts, what nonsense are you talking about.

238
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:34,620
Hey, hey! Why do you grab the lettuce and eat it like that?

239
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:39,220
- Because if I eat lettuce, I s– 
 - You sleep well, yeah yeah.

240
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,720
Hyung, give me some money.

241
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,980
Okay.

242
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:51,220
W-Woo Cheon, when you use a lot of cash,

243
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:55,970
bring me back a cash receipt, I need to receive a tax deduction. Okay? Tax.

244
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,710
Got it?

245
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,680
"You all sure are living freaking hard."

246
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,670
What did you say, punk?

247
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:08,090
No matter what, isn't it a bit much to say something like that to your hyung?

248
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,900
I thought she wouldn't come... She was sulking, so I thought she wouldn't come.

249
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:19,890
In Sook, since you came, I feel a bit more at peace.

250
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,550
I just... wanted to butt in somewhere.

251
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,830
- Good job! 
 - Let's have a drink for In Sook.

252
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,730
Let's have a drink.

253
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,460
Drink up!

254
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:37,890
 People always say... It's like you have an epiphany when facing death.

255
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:42,550
 Even if you do everything you want, life is short.

256
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:47,920
But I have nothing I want to do.

257
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,190
Hey, stop drinking.

258
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,140
That's it.

259
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,130
Stop drinking!

260
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:01,930
- Stop drinking! 
 - Enough enough.

261
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:06,150
- You should stop drinking. 
 - You have to go out tomorrow.

262
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:09,590

263
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,990
Hospice...

264
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,850

265
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,030
 It's really good.

266
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,500
 The atmosphere is good.

267
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,030
Why did we get divorced?

268
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,300
There was no reason, I just hated living like that.

269
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,090
Just? What about me? Did you consider me?

270
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:16,110
There’s a saying mothers need to raise a child until they’re at least three.

271
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,440
She did at least that much.

272
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,520
It's just that I... I can't live like that.

273
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:27,600
It's just the way I was born. Honestly, who can make music while living like that?

274
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,220
You're already past the age to be begging for your mother anyway.

275
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,810
Just have fun living and enjoy your life. You should live your life while having fun.

276
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,770
 Yay! Woo hoo!

277
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:43,500
Quiet down! You're so loud, we can't have a conversation.

278
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,770
Got it, got it. All right, quiet.

279
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:49,610
Sorry, it's hard to speak when it's so loud. Right?

280
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:59,790
It seems like you've forgotten that I can't hear well.

281
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:05,310
Dad... they say I'm dying.

282
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:10,780
- Huh? 
 - A brain tumor. They say they can't do surgery.

283
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,700
I didn't tell grandma. I won't tell her.

284
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,690
So, Dad, you can never tell her.

285
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,920
I plan on going into a hospice.

286
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,590
But it seems that I don't have the money to check-in.

287
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,550
They said it's about 5,000,000 won (~$5,000 USD)

288
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:32,020
Since I think I'll die after using about that much,

289
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,440
give me some money.

290
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:04,210
Why are you doing stupid things all day long?

291
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,250
Grandma, you nicked your head here that one time.

292
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,470
- Did you quit being a body scrubber? 
 - Yeah.

293
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:15,430
- My goodness, good job! 
 - You're smiling?

294
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,310
- Do something else. 
 - What?

295
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:20,390
A company! With a computer and everything, that kind of company.

296
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,730
Sure.

297
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,040
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

298
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:31,690
But before that,

299
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:35,980
I plan on going on a trip. For a few months.

300
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,410
A t-trip? To where?

301
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:41,300
- Abroad. 
 - Abroad where?

302
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:46,470
- Singapore. 
 - Where is that? India?

303
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,270
Isn't it China?

304
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,820
You're going and you don't even know where it is?

305
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:56,230
Well, it's just... the pronunciation is nice... Singapore.

306
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:59,770
A load of crap. Goodness.

307
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:11,080
Grandma, from now on, don't pick up what others have thrown out.

308
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:17,310
- You picked me up, too. 
 - Who threw you away? Not a stranger.

309
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:23,520
If I don't throw it away, you'll live on this trash pile until you die.

310
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,930
Let's throw it away, please?

311
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:31,720
What are you saying? It's all useful.

312
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:37,640
Why would we throw this away?

313
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,030
- It's broken. 
 - It's fine if we fix it and use it!

314
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,880
When, huh? When?

315
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,240
When exactly?

316
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,530
I mean, why would you even pick something like this up?

317
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:54,410
I want to use it as a pillow when I sleep.

318
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:58,200
Grandma! Why do you live like this?!

319
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,860
What's up with you?

320
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,740
It's gross.

321
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,180
I hate it all, I just hate it all!

322
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,490
Do you think I like living like this?

323
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:11,150
That's what I'm saying, let's just throw it all away. Just throw it all out.

324
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:15,420
As long as we throw this all away, it will be fine. If we just throw all of this away, it'll be alright.

325
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:23,090
You can't win over me, girl.

326
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,060
Hm? My goodness, really.

327
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,500
What is this?

328
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,930
There, you're hurt.

329
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:11,660
I mean, it's bruised. Why would you put on red medicine?

330
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,190
It's skinned!

331
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,430
Ah, seriously.

332
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,970
Why is nothing going right?

333
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,220
Things can't go right, can they?

334
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,890
What has to be all right?

335
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:30,020
Grandma...

336
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:35,270
I'm scared.

337
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:37,380
Of what?

338
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,380
I...

339
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:48,920
No– What is all this? It's scary.

340
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,380
What is this? It's so scary.

341
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,770
You...

342
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:59,730
You, you... This is the first time I've seen you cry in my life!

343
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,410

344
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:33,100

345
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,480

346
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:58,590
 Wow, Venice. Venice is really nice.

347
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:03,030
 There is water everywhere. Laying down and having a glass of beer is just...

348
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:06,220
 Hey, that's really heaven right there.

349
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,380
Heaven?

350
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,760
- Hey, let's go out. 
 - Huh?

351
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,150
Hurry and come out.

352
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,850
Okay.

353
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,840
Why are we coming out? Go inside, Grandma.

354
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:42,340
- What is that? 
 - I called a taxi. I asked them to take you to the airport.

355
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,230
He's a guy I know, so it's cheap.

356
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,650
Mister, take care of her well.

357
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:50,040
Yes. Don't worry, I'll escort her well.

358
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,170
- Why? There's a bus to the airport. 
 - This is your first trip.

359
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:56,450
I really wanted to do this for you.

360
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:59,720
Hurry, get in. Hurry and get in.

361
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,030
Get in.

362
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,820
Hurry up!

363
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:15,650
Go!

364
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,480
Set off!

365
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:35,800
 Grandma... I'm sorry.

366
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,890
 I love you...

367
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,370
 so much.

368
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,490

369
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:17,850

370
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,510
Everyone! It's me, Mi Do!

371
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,850
Hello! Hi!

372
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:49,180

373
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:52,360
I'm so excited!

374
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,450
Huh? There was something there?

375
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,970
- What are you talking about?

376
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:08,660
There was something there? A ghost?

377
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,740
Let's go back, to give a greeting.

378
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,550
Okay, go!

379
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,810
Oh my! Oh my!

380
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,700
Oh my, what? It was a person!

381
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,140
I guess it wasn't a ghost.

382
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,440
Hello!

383
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,180
What to do? Goodbye!

384
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,960
Let's go!

385
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,210
That's so funny. Ah, Goo Ji Pyo?

386
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,220
Oppa, they're saying this is the first time they've seen a chaebol.

387
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,630
I'm not a chaebol, I'm an employee.

388
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:15,260
And this beautiful person?

389
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:19,910
Hey, you guys already know! My bestie!

390
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:23,370
You're getting foundation on my clothes. They're really expensive...

391
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:26,710
Ah... sorry sorry.

392
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:26,150
Excuse me!

393
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,660
I...

394
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,960
I...

395
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,860
I... Where.?

396
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:59,060
W-W-Wait!

397
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:08,810
Hey, y-you...

398
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:51,250
My goodness, she got startled!

399
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,300
I haven't seen her before.

400
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,690
She's pretty.

401
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,020
We were really scared yesterday.

402
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:50,020
I was worried that something had happened when you didn't come even though your arrival time had long passed.

403
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,790
10 years ago, Sister Magdalena started this as her long-awaited business.

404
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:59,870
You can think of it as a women's only guesthouse.

405
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:04,450
Typically, hospices are intended for people with around 6 months left to live,

406
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:08,460
but we don't really put any limitations on the time period.

407
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:13,130
Look, look, look, look.

408
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:17,060
Look, look, look over there!

409
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:20,820
My goodness, it seems like she woke up!

410
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:24,490
- Why was she going in there in the middle of the night? 
 - Since a while ago,

411
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:29,260
there was some strange sound from near the end of the church.

412
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,300
I saw something like a white shadow that one time.

413
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,960
She must have thought that we were ghosts.

414
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,400
Falling over surprised.

415
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,630
I don't know if you've heard the rumors, but this place was in ruins for a long time.

416
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,150
Rumors?

417
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:47,560
Since the buildings here are large and there's a lot of land,

418
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,860
some actor bought this place for dirt cheap.

419
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:55,220
But not long after, he died choking on a rice cake in a drama.

420
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,160
After that, a chaebol bought it,

421
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,960
but... what was it? A stomach ache? Ah! Death while having sex!

422
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,240
Anyways, rumors started to go around about this place being cursed.

423
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,370
And so Sister Magdalena bought this place that had long been empty

424
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:14,460
for dirt cheap! How lucky!

425
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,170
Over there, is the cafeteria.

426
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:12,590
We have services covering everything from aches to spiritual care.

427
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:20,150
Those people are volunteers,

428
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:23,790
and this hospice's only men,

429
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,610
but I'll explain more...

430
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:32,700
a bit later. Come this way.

431
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:43,740
Since we are an independent hospital, we operate in connection with a special hospital.

432
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,960
So in case of an emergency, a perfect alternative is possible.

433
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,370
In the medical treatment room, Doctor Jo gives simple condition examinations.

434
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:56,670
How are your meals? Food is everything. If you have good food, that's enough.

435
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,740
However you look at it, numbered rooms seem very hospital-like.

436
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,090
So we named each room with a movie title.

437
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:12,880
You can change it at any time as well: melo, horror.

438
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,530
Patients tend to change them according to their emotional state.

439
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,710
Here it is.

440
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:23,490

441
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:30,130

442
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:49,630
Your spot is inside here–

443
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:53,470
That's so funny!

444
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,830
Surprise!

445
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:59,130
Everyone, I'll introduce today's new face!

446
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:01,680
Hello!

447
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:09,990
This is mine?

448
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,870
Hey, this isn't yours. Is it?

449
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:22,070
 Goodbye!

450
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:26,510
You didn't buy this, did you? It's over a million won.

451
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:32,290
No! It's just because I lost this yesterday.

452
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:35,990
Everyone! I found it!

453
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:39,710

454
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:42,400

455
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,690
Oh my!

456
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,410
Oh my!

457
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:52,530
Oh my!

458
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:56,540
What the heck?

459
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:01,030
Hey!

460
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:04,250
(Hurry!)

461
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:11,330
There's a fight! Someone's fighting.

462
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,110
- They're pulling hair! 
 - Let go!

463
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:18,880
- Let go while I'm being nice! 
 - Pulling hair! Pulling hair!

464
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,030
What's our new friend's condition?

465
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:24,170
- Breast cancer? 
 - These days people don't die from breast cancer too easily.

466
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:27,090
I haven't seen a dogfight like this

467
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:29,630
in a really long time.

468
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:32,220
Breast cancer sounds good, too. I wish I were younger.

469
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,840
I got it. I got it. I got it. On the count of three, let's let go.

470
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:39,250
- Okay. 
 - One, two, three!

471
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,650
Hey!

472
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:47,050
- Geez. 
 - Go to this side.

473
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:49,110
Hey!

474
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,580
You're right! It's not mine! I picked it up.

475
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:57,710
After some crazy bitch dropped it while screeching in a car acting crazy and endangering people!

476
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:00,900
That's right! I don't buy pieces of cloth like this for millions of won!

477
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:05,550
Hey! Do you know who I am!? I'm Sung Mi Do! The influencer!

478
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:07,850
Influenza?

479
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:13,290
Talking about influenza, you can make jokes in a situation like this?

480
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:17,330
- Hey, you know me, don't you? 
 - I sure do.

481
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:21,050
- I know kids like you very well. 
 - What did you say?

482
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:23,010
You're pretty.

483
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:25,230
- That's all. 
 - What?

484
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,360
That's all there is to you people.

485
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,770
But...

486
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:35,020
it looks like you're dying, too.

487
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,590
 Wait a moment.

488
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:50,600
 Excuse me

489
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:03,020
Was it two years ago? Two patients

490
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:07,850
were pulling their hair out and fighting like the two of you.

491
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:13,220
One person died like that.

492
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:16,870
Was it a heart attack?

493
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:19,030
That person died without even closing their eyes.

494
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:23,520
That was the last face that person saw.

495
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:28,240
What? Are you threatening me?

496
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,090
You have been like this often, Mi Do. She has lung cancer...

497
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:38,190
What? Why are you revealing others' illnesses?

498
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:40,260
Didn't you know that not revealing illnesses is an unwritten law here?

499
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:45,190
Oh, is that so? As the director of this place, I didn't know that.

500
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:49,160
Hey. Reveal yours as well. What's yours?

501
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,470
What is yours?!

502
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:52,820
Okay, okay. Calm down.

503
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:55,460
You can't fight in a hospice center.

504
00:45:55,460 --> 00:46:00,390
Of course, I understand. You are unable to control your anger, right?

505
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:05,670
Not because your personality is messy, it's also a symptom of the disease.

506
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:08,990
The anger control disorder program is at two o'clock

507
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:11,440
The two of you, make sure to attend it.

508
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,590
I won't.

509
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:15,920
Forget it. What kind of school is this?

510
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,020
I'll just go to the hospital.

511
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:26,300
She's cute, isn't she?

512
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,820
You didn't want others to know, so you didn't write it down?

513
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:34,620
- What? 
 - Hearing ability.

514
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,920
You didn't write down that you have a problem hearing.

515
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,630
Health-related conditions must be filled in without any omissions.

516
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:46,670
I will not tell anyone other than Dr. Jo.

517
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:50,670
I don't think there will be any dangerous situation.

518
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:53,640
Congratulations on coming to the hospice!

519
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,530
Is that really something to congratulate?

520
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:58,820
Ah, then welcome. Welcome is the right term.

521
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:04,630
This is a place to live. It's not a place to wait to die.

522
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:06,550
After knowing that you are terminally ill,

523
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:09,900
the world remains the same, but you change.

524
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:15,420
Living as if nothing ever happened, is actually hard.

525
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,800
It's lonely and scary, isn't it?

526
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:23,400
That's why I thought of a place where people with similar circumstances can gather.

527
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,070
There are many hospice programs!

528
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:28,800
- Art therapy, gardening... 
 - No.

529
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,690
- Why? 
 - This is funny.

530
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:33,120
Closing your eyes and deceiving yourself.

531
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:37,560
When we are going to die soon, singing, arranging flowers... What treatment do we do?

532
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,790
Then, what would you like to do?

533
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,030
Just forget it.

534
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:45,390
I want to throw it away, after enjoyably watching time go by.

535
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:47,480
Why did you come here?

536
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,550
Because of the discount. But do you know how freaking stupid it is?

537
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:53,040
Giving discounts to young people.

538
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:58,500
You were the only one to ask for installments to pay the fees.

539
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:03,420
That... I couldn't break the savings... I will pay you everything soon.

540
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:07,310
Until then, try to live as best as you can!

541
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:13,930
Look at the sun!

542
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:19,280
 Every human faces death.

543
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,120
 They're dying slowly, but

544
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:25,230
 they are insensibly living their life.

545
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:29,180
- No. no. That's not it. 
 - I won't play.

546
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:33,830
 There are some that know when they'll die, and some who don't.

547
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:37,220
Today also, hang in there.

548
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:41,970
 That could also be a chance.

549
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:45,500
 To find something new, to love

550
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:49,680
 to be grateful. A chance to feel all this.

551
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,800
 When something good is happening,

552
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,900
 you don't move past that.

553
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:05,440
 Mostly, happiness is in the smallest of moments.

554
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,820
 If you realize that, every day feels different.

555
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:12,620
 You will be able to see something else.

556
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:17,500

557
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,830
Ong Do, can you play trot as well?

558
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:41,560
- Madam, I'll do it! 
 - Oh, it's fine!

559
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,690
You gave it right away.

560
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:46,060
This won't be enough. Nearly twenty people are coming.

561
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,620
Seating everyone here will also be difficult.

562
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:51,320
Why did you call so many people? You should have divided.

563
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,320
This is my first Open House after coming here.

564
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,930
Everyone wanted to come so bad. I tried to select only a few people.

565
00:49:57,930 --> 00:50:01,460
Honestly, they are not people who would come to a place like this.

566
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:04,360
Because this place is very shabby.

567
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:07,060
Shabby? Shabby!!??

568
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:11,020
Oh my! That's a word I haven't heard in a long time!

569
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:13,160
Who? Who's coming?

570
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,460
I am also your follower.

571
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:19,750
I'll just do it separately on the outdoor terrace.

572
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:23,840
There are many helping hands... All I need to set is the table and flowers.

573
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:27,600
I ordered some steak also.

574
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,760
She's cute!

575
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:36,280

576
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,540
Hello?

577
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:44,430
Hello?

578
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:47,860
Mom? Can you hear me?

579
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,010
Hello?

580
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,720
Mom?

581
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,330
Who's that? It's the first time I've seen his face.

582
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:26,020
Is it someone's husband?

583
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:28,840
Whose husband came to a hospice and is playing golf?

584
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,070
Maybe he stopped here before going to play golf.

585
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:36,320
It's a party day, but... oh my god. I don't want to see his face.

586
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,280
I'll see you later!

587
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:50,560
I know, right. How can you transfer the savings to my mother-in-law's account?

588
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,930
That... I am like this here... my mom—

589
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:55,540
What is it with your mother and my mother? I will take care of everything.

590
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:58,050
With old people, we don't know when what might happen.

591
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:01,900
Password? She might forget it. It's better that I manage all the money.

592
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:05,220
- No, even so. That... 
 - No, in any case.

593
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,820
- Mother-in-Law is living with us anyway.  
 - What?

594
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:12,650
Today, I was going to bring her along. Something happened, so I am here alone.

595
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:15,330
Where... is Mom right now?

596
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:18,190
At my house! When you came here,

597
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:21,330
 what else could I do?

598
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:31,730
 Oh my! Oh my goodness. Oh my...

599
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:35,990
 Didn't you take the medicine?

600
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:38,350
My mother's Parkinson's disease is getting worse slowly.

601
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:40,450
Even people I hire for help don't last long.

602
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:43,290
Your mother came in to fill in your spot to help.

603
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:47,180
Coming to think of it, what's the use of a mother-in-law coming back and forth.

604
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:49,540
She is family, we could live together.

605
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:56,180
Why is that spot mine?

606
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,190

607
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:23,030

608
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:28,950

609
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:35,130

610
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:08,360
What if you have money?

611
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:11,900
What will you do living like this?

612
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:14,270
- Is it good? It is, isn't it? 
 - Yes, it is.

613
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:16,920
Only in our room,

614
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,450
there is such a big cockroach.

615
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:22,520
Apply properly.

616
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,760
I love you, my daughter! Okay, go now. Hurry.

617
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,640
Be safe!

618
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:39,820
Oh god. She is still like that.

619
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:42,060
Maybe no one showed up.

620
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:45,050
What did you say? Influ... oncer?

621
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:48,340
She's very popular on the internet. She had her own shopping mall.

622
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:51,660
She was criticized for selling luxury counterfeits.

623
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:54,200
Then her parents... What had happened?

624
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:58,010
They fell into debt and closed the shopping mall also. Did you see her family coming here?

625
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:00,820
Then they came here.. and talk about our lives?

626
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:03,710
She wrote a diary about terminal illness. So she is really popular now.

627
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:06,550
Kids these days do all sorts of things.

628
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:08,350
Is that something to show off?

629
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:11,240
- But why doesn't anyone come? 
 - How pitiful...

630
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:14,800
Hey, we're more pitiful!

631
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,200

632
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:29,820

633
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:42,440

634
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:45,040
-  This kind of birthday party is fresh.  
 -  Mi Do and Ho Seon is the best combination.

635
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,880
-  Birthday party looks fun.  
 -  Seong Mi Do's party, of course it's possible.

636
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,880
 Everyone, saw my SNS right?

637
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,610
 We are preparing a lot for the party.

638
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:56,530
 Hi! Please come, everyone!

639
00:55:56,530 --> 00:55:58,830
 We'll wait here!

640
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:02,920
 As expected, Ho Seon's class doesn't match Mi Do.

641
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,440
 This is a total celebrity-only party.

642
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:46,720
Woo-Woo Cheon. This one... sup-superiors are involved.

643
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:51,500
I-I will never be investigated b-because of an accident in one room.

644
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,110

645
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,880
The important thing is the phone.

646
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,070
Make sure to take care of his phone.

647
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:01,100

648
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,640
Life insurance...

649
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:07,840

650
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,430
He's trying to kill the kid.

651
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:32,450
- What are you doing? You're such a nuisance! 
 - What are you doing?

652
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:34,970
Why don't you just die?

653
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:39,160
Even you are ignoring me?

654
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,880
My goodness, why are you doing this?

655
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:51,870

656
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,090
Seriously.

657
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:15,240
Geez!

658
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:40,270

659
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:47,470
Gosh!

660
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:55,910
- Hey! 
 - What?

661
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:58,720
- Why are you acting like this? 
 -  It's a video call.

662
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,770
My grandmother thinks I'm overseas.

663
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:05,550
Well, take it over there.

664
00:59:06,350 --> 00:59:08,550
Oh, okay.

665
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:16,510
Grandmother! Your... Your face what happened?

666
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:22,430
That lowlife... San Ah's father...

667
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:24,640
 Yeah, what about him?

668
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,140
What's going on?!

669
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:30,480
I was coming home... and on the bridge...

670
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,760
he beat me up violently.

671
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:38,850
- You didn't report it? 
 - I lost the taste for it after seeing his eyes.

672
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:43,500
What if something happened to San Ah because I did something useless?

673
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:47,310
 - So I didn't. 
 - Still!  You should have reported it!

674
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:53,920
My dreams were unsettling last night, so something feels off.

675
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:59,110
 The kid's mother isn't even there, I at least want to take the kid away.

676
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:03,020
 Hey! San Ah!

677
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,720
Grandmother! Grandmother! Grandmother!

678
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,600
- Wh-What? Did she hang up? 
 - I have to go.

679
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:18,500
No, where are you planning on going alone at night?

680
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,750
I'll take you there by car.

681
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:25,090
Exactly who is it? What kind of crazy guy beats up an old person?

682
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:26,570
A man who lives in my neighborhood.

683
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:29,890
Is there... a child in the house?

684
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:33,810
Yes. There is a child.

685
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:45,330
The child always hangs around outside of the house

686
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:47,820
because the house is the most dangerous.

687
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:54,390
 Who are you glaring at?! Why are you glaring?!

688
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:57,530
 Why would you give me the side-eye?!

689
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:02,450
 Be careful!

690
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,810
 Enjoying the view?

691
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:09,290
But she can't escape.

692
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:13,120
The child only waits for her mother who's left the house.

693
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:20,320
But the one who always comes back... is her father.

694
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:26,350
The child knows, that she will eventually die in that house.

695
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,990
I said I would protect her... I said that I would protect her.

696
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:34,840
You go take them.

697
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:41,900
- San Ah? 
 - No. That bastard.

698
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:47,160
What are you saying? Are you suggesting that she kill him?

699
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:49,980
If you could kill one person,

700
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:54,520
in order to save someone else, would you not make the choice?

701
01:01:56,290 --> 01:02:00,520
We're dying anyway. What about...

702
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,620
taking just one person with you?

703
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:14,280
 You never know, it might be better if I die on my own.

704
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:20,310
 My mom said, one day we will die by my fathers hands.

705
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:27,780
What are you going to do by going alone?

706
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:35,780
You're hungry, right?

707
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:41,220
Tasty milk.

708
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:15,230
I definitely heard something.

709
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:32,350
Hey, you like white milk. Wait, I bought bread too.

710
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:38,820
Wow, there's bread and milk too.

711
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:42,190
San Ah,  you like this milk.

712
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:45,170
Drink. Drink.

713
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:48,590
Drink it! Drink, drink.

714
01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:52,330
Take it, drink up! Why are you acting like this? You like white milk.

715
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:55,360
Okay, drink it all up. One shot, one shot.

716
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:58,090
Drink it all up! You have to in order to grow taller.

717
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,110
One shot, one shot!

718
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,660
No!

719
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:11,760
Seriously?

720
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,690
Save me!

721
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:16,840
Save me!

722
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:21,360
Hey! Will I snatch you up and eat you?!

723
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,400
Are you not going to stop!?

724
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,230
What the!

725
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:33,760
Ha San Ah where are...

726
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:37,160
Hey!  Where did she...?

727
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:41,710
Hey, Ha San Ah! Where are you? Aren't you coming back?

728
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:43,240
Hey.

729
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:46,010
Han San Ah!

730
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:51,030
Where are you? Let's speak human to human in a human way!

731
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:54,670
Your dad dressed up nicely for the first time in a while.

732
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:04,120
Are you kidding me...

733
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:39,500
You sly little–

734
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:43,120
Hey. Hey!

735
01:05:45,830 --> 01:05:48,650
- Hey! Stop there! 
 - Save me!

736
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:50,880
Hey, Hey!

737
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:57,220
Ow, that hurts. Damn it.

738
01:05:58,220 --> 01:05:59,860
Where?

739
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:09,130
Hey! Hey, San Ah!

740
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:20,130
Hey, San Ah!

741
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:25,190
Don't get caught.

742
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:42,390
Hey! Where are you, Ha San Ah? Hurry and come out!

743
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:44,650
Let's just end it now!

744
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:46,920
Don't resent your dad!

745
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:50,860
This is all because of this damned rotting world,

746
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:53,980
with no hole to find even a penny!

747
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:43,660
- I won't go. I won't go. 
 - Let's put an end to this. Stop it!

748
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:50,000
Hey! Hey! Get up.

749
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,490
Hey!

750
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:57,150
Get up! Ah!

751
01:07:59,590 --> 01:08:04,060
You bastard. What the fuck? Who are you?

752
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:05,800
I'm her dad! You...

753
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:08,060
crazy bastard!

754
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:12,690
Who are you, you bastard!

755
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:16,100
What's your deal, you bastard?!

756
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,600
Do you know who I am?

757
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:37,990
I'm her dad, you crazy jerk!

758
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:30,900

759
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,570
 Relationships of hate. Relationships of debt. He was quite the person worth killing.

760
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:35,060
 If it's a relationship of hate,

761
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:37,610
 why would they have left a flower there?

762
01:09:37,610 --> 01:09:38,830
 Why would you go to the crime scene?

763
01:09:38,830 --> 01:09:41,490
 What kind of idiot goes to a crime scene where someone died?

764
01:09:41,490 --> 01:09:44,430
 Did my dad... die?

765
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:47,400
 Now... I can live together with my mom, right?

766
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,960
 Why would you kill someone and put a flower on his head?

767
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,560
 You're dead. I'm dead. We're all going to die!

768
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,440
 W-What happened?

769
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,850
 You have to remove the variable.

770
01:09:57,850 --> 01:09:59,640
 I'll take care of it.

771
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:06,360

772
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:08,840
 Exploding with joy!
