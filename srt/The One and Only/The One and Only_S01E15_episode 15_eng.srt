1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,270
 I want to see it.

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,460
 - The green ray? 
 - Yeah.

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,760
 It's hard to see the green ray.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,980
 The atmosphere has to be really clean.

5
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,540
 The sun is different from what we see.

6
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,870
 When the sun seems to reach the horizon,

7
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,250
 it's actually already below it.

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,050
 Out of all of the colors, green is the one that is deflected the most.

9
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,280
 The color that is visible when the sun disappears below.

10
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:00,200
 If there's green in Heaven,

11
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,270
 would it really be that kind of color?

12
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,610

13
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,830
 The strong suspects in the Moss Rose Serial Killings, Pyo In Sook and Min Woo Cheon,

14
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,330
 have been detained by the police.

15
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,940
 The police, who were dispatched after receiving a tip

16
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,370
 that the culprit was hiding in a hospice located somewhere in Gyeonggi province,

17
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,890
 revealed that they have escorted the two suspects to the station, and have begun the investigation.

18
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:38,000

19
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,660
Having trouble sleeping?

20
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,360
Yeah.

21
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,110
But... is In Sook really

22
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,210
at the hospice?

23
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,090
Yeah.

24
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,490
But, Mom, this is a secret.

25
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:15,330
Until they catch the real culprit.

26
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,220
Okay.

27
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,260
It's heavy for you, too. Isn't it?

28
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,700
- What? 
 - It's heavy for you, too.

29
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,490
Because you're hiding a secret.

30
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,020
I'm okay, Mom.

31
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,700
You...

32
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,620
You knew?

33
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,460
You did it for me.

34
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,000
You and In Sook, both

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,710
did everything to protect me.

36
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,640
So...

37
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,860
I'm okay.

38
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,820
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,530
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,100
So the first murder, Ha Yong Geun, wasn't Pyo In Sook either.

41
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,020
Yes.

42
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:41,800
So what happened with the watch that Pyo In Sook brought from the crime scene?

43
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,490
That day, I took the watch.

44
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:50,150
I sold it, but I went to find it again because it kept bothering my conscience.

45
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:55,610
But... In Sook asked me to give it to her.

46
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,870
She said that she would take the fall for everything.

47
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,460
I shouldn't have given it to her...

48
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,710
I gave it to her.

49
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,870
 - Congrats Unnie !
 - Congrats on the marriage!

50
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,290
 - You're finally joining the ranks of married women? 
 - I saw it on Koo Ji Pyo's page.

51
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,470
- What is this? 
  - Congrats.

52
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,400

53
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,460
 We are getting married as planned.

54
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,860
Mi Do!

55
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,820
Hello.

56
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,120
Were you surprised?

57
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,410
What's going on all of a sudden? On your social media...

58
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,090
I posted first, because I was so happy.

59
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,470
Was I to hasty?

60
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,150
You must feel a bit off... she was your friend, after all.

61
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:30,890
I must have been too focused on us. I was so happy.

62
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,850
Where did you go yesterday?

63
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,360
What?

64
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,110
When I woke up, you weren't there.

65
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,330
Oh, I had some business to attend to yesterday.

66
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,220
You were sleeping so well, that it would have been rude to wake you.

67
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,450
Are you mad because of that?

68
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,300
Since we'll live together from now on, I'll wake you up every day.

69
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,160
I told my dad that we would be getting married as planned, too.

70
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,720
Oppa.

71
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,540
Are you a bad person?

72
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,520
What does that mean?

73
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,600
You asked me

74
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,680
if I would love you, even if you were a bad person.

75
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,530
That... that was because I was too caught up in my feelings.

76
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,270
I get that way when my dad comes up in conversation.

77
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,840
You're not, right?

78
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:32,230
I'm sorry, I won't leave you alone again.

79
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,460
 You won't be...

80
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,050
 It's nothing.

81
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,260
Why did you do that?

82
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,140
What are you going to do about San Ah?

83
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,080
She just found her happiness.

84
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,720
It's the same for you.

85
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,960
You just found your happiness.

86
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,380
San Ah said it herself, that you look happy.

87
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:07,430
That it was the first time she had seen your face like that, and that she wanted to protect it.

88
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,160
San Ah knew?

89
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:25,860
She's known the whole time, but was stuck, unable to say anything.

90
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,810
That young kid probably struggled so much.

91
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,600
That was the first worry that I had.

92
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,200
More than you, In Sook, I was concerned for San Ah.

93
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,310
I'm sorry.

94
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:50,850
So... I'm turning myself in for San Ah.

95
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,260
That secret is too big

96
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,670
for her to bear.

97
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,670
But...

98
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,390
San Ah will need her mother.

99
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,500
Grandma said that she would look after her.

100
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,050
 Y-You...

101
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,170
 You d-d-did that?

102
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:22,510
 I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

103
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,700
 I hesitated for too long.

104
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,310
 I can't say that it's all right.

105
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,610
 I understand.

106
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,130
 Since I pity my child more,

107
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,270
 I can't say that.

108
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,620
 I understand.

109
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,550
 You, how could you do this to me?

110
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,430
 My child became a killler,

111
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,760
 and dragged that body around like that...

112
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,280
 A kid that could die anywhere, at any time, went through that living hell.

113
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,340
 How...

114
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,380
 How?

115
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,230
 San Ah...

116
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,010
 I couldn't leave San Ah alone.

117
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,610
 A kid who smiles now...

118
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:22,070
 I couldn't leave her alone and go.

119
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,410
 Then, what about my child? What about my kid?

120
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,940
 She knew everything and couldn't say anything.

121
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,800
 She said that she would take the blame for everything.

122
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,160
 Can you imagine swallowing something like that alone?

123
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,860
 Can you imagine feeling so dark inside?

124
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,180
 She was going to die, anyway...

125
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,860
 Does that invalidate her life?

126
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,030
 I'm sorry.

127
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,210
 I shouldn't do that.

128
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,460
 I'll turn myself in.

129
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,600
 I'm going to take hold of everything.

130
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,260
 I hate you.

131
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,140
 No matter what you try,

132
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,020
 I hate you.

133
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:34,730
 But... I don't hate San Ah.

134
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:39,800
 I can't. Don't worry about San Ah.

135
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,940
 Because she needs me. That child.

136
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,490
What are you saying?

137
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,740
Chief wants us to process this as a serial murder...

138
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,080
and once things quiet down a littleâ€”

139
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,670
The real culprit confessed, so why would we process it that way?

140
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,140
That's what I told her too, but she said that's the situation...

141
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,840
Because she's going to die anyway?

142
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,370
So she wants us to end it by framing her as the serial murderer?

143
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,730
I don't know if she's trying to build her career up with a big case...

144
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:27,240
or maybe a higher-upper is pressuring her. Gosh, I don't know anymore.

145
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,730
I'm annoyed, too.

146
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,280
Don't you think this is Koo Ji Pyo's influence?

147
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,280
Woo Kyeong Mi turned herself in!

148
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,680
We can get a confession out of the third suspect,

149
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,740
and solve the Park Doo Jin case. That's it.

150
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,480
- What about Sin Tae Il? 
 - There's absolutely no trace.

151
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,110
Pyo In Sook and Min Woo Cheon are innocent.

152
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,210
We have to release them within 48 hours.

153
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,490
You'll get to leave soon.

154
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,460
We have to hurry up and solve the Park Doo Jin case.

155
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,650
But we have no leads on Sin Tae Il's whereabouts.

156
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,800
There's an electronics repair shop called, Everything In Life.

157
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,600
You'll be able to track his whereabouts if you go there.

158
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,970
Are you aware of this?

159
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:16,900
After Sin Tae Il gets arrested, the charge of soliciting murder through Narae's Cleaning has to go through,

160
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,410
for us to get to Koo Ji Pyo.

161
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:24,110
Then you will have to admit to accepting a murder request and take responsibility for it.

162
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:28,170
Woo Cheon's only involvement was that he received a request for the murder of Ha Yong Geun.

163
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,360
There is no need to dig up everything before that.

164
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,280
We have Narae's Cleaning's transaction history.

165
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,130
Once we find a request for murder, we can't stop the investigation.

166
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,180

167
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,370
Hey, what are you doing?

168
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,400
W-Woo Cheon got caught.

169
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,480
Right, now that he's caught, our situation will be sorted out.

170
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,870
Koo Ji Pyo will take care of it himself.

171
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:11,040
I have known W-Woo Cheon for a l-long time.

172
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:17,280
I've known him for the l-longest time in my life.

173
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,110
I have never seen Woo Cheon s-smile like that.

174
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,550
Don't get emotionally attached to people you work with.

175
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,700
You're ruining my mood.

176
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,560
Count it thoroughly. I may have pocketed a little for myself.

177
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,810
 I'm sorry.

178
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,050
- W-What are you doing? 
 - Damn it.

179
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,920
Hold on.

180
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,980
Back. Take the back door!

181
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,900
- Grandma! 
 - In Sook! My In Sook.

182
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:17,800
- My mom went to the police station. 
 - Goodness.

183
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,310
Are you all right?

184
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,200
Then, what about my In Sook?

185
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,690
My mom turned herself in,

186
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:28,840
so In Sook will be okay now.

187
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,460
I have so many things I want to do with you.

188
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,020
What do you want to do?

189
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,980
- I want to watch a movie together... 
 - And?

190
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,100
and I also want to get drunk with you.

191
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,020
What else?

192
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,080
I want to go to a karaoke room, too.

193
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:23,510
I also want to try wearing a couple's outfit.

194
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,790
I don't like that one.

195
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:30,690
- You don't? 
 - No.

196
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:36,310
Then I want to take pictures together.

197
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,920
- What else? 
 - I also want to...

198
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,940
go to your house.

199
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,090
- My house? 
 - Yes.

200
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:51,800
I want to... live with you.

201
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,540
But this is it.

202
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,080
Maybe I'm getting punished, at last.

203
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:16,390
Now of all times. When I want to live the most.

204
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:24,030
When I have something I want most. When I need time the most.

205
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,000
I guess I'm getting the harshest punishment.

206
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,680
This is sausage!

207
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,700
You bought sausages, Grandma?

208
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,730
Of course, I bought it. You thought I picked it up from the streets?

209
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,860
Hurry up and eat.

210
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,620
It is so yummy! It is really yummy.

211
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,320
This is yummy, too!

212
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,500
I like to cook too, Grandma.

213
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,640
I will cook for you next time.

214
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,490
I'm good at making egg rolls. They taste even better with green onions in them.

215
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,710
Don't say stuff like that.

216
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,750
Pardon?

217
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:42,350
You shouldn't say stuff like that at your age. Why are you trying to hold it in?

218
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:47,030
Pretending like you're fine. Like everything is all right.

219
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,500
How is it that you do the exact same thing In Sook used to do?

220
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,590
Cry if it hurts. Hide if you are scared.

221
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,380
Shout if you get angry.

222
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,000
That's what you do at your age.

223
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,640
Mom!

224
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,950
My baby.

225
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:26,310
I can see my mom again, right?

226
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,380
She'll come out after receiving her punishment, right?

227
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:34,060
Of course. Absolutely.

228
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,690
There's no doubt.

229
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,820
Don't cry.

230
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,580
Don't cry.

231
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,140
Don't cry, baby.

232
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,650
Unnie.

233
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,760
Unnie?

234
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,280
You scared me.

235
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,930
I keep feeling sleepy.

236
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:24,020
What is it? Did something happen?

237
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:31,200
 I found out where he is. I'll tell you his whereabouts after you give me the money.

238
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:39,340
No. It's nothing.

239
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,670
Something happened, right?

240
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,410
What do you plan on doing?

241
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:53,740
What else? We have to announce that Woo Kyeong Mi turned herself in.

242
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:58,590
The problem is the moss flower. Since it's become an important theme in these murders,

243
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,120
we can't brush it over by saying it was a coincidence.

244
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,400
We can't say that Woo Kyeong Mi pinned a moss flower on her husband after she murdered him.

245
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,600
Nor can we say that the hitman who was feeling strange that day

246
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,140
pinned the moss flower on the head of the dead body.

247
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,030
Why did you feel that way?

248
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,460
Just because... I met you.

249
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,510
It's funny because it was a signal of love for you.

250
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:31,570
But the fact that it became a signal of anger to the world.

251
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,310
Team Leader?

252
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:38,080
No, no thanks. I don't want to listen. I know what Jo Jia said.

253
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,700
- Come on. Just a second. 
 - No.

254
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,800
Just a moment.

255
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
What?

256
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,550
- Chief got replaced. 
 - What? Why?

257
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,720
After we caught Pyo In Sook and Min Woo Cheon yesterday, she got excited and drank.

258
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,530
She got a DUI.

259
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,560
Let's be real, it's not like it's the first time.

260
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,620
- I knew this was going to happen. 
 - Gosh.

261
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,790
What are you doing?

262
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,370
Putting it off.

263
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,320
What?

264
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,340
The passing of time.

265
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,300
Does time not pass if you walk like that?

266
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,920
It feels like it's passing slower.

267
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,640
I can see time flowing in between my legs.

268
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,890
You're a fool, aren't you?

269
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,140
Let's run.

270
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,030
- Huh? 
 - To save time.

271
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,260
Did you see the news?

272
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,960
Then the wife killed him?

273
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,850
What about Pyo In Sook? Why did she turn herself in?

274
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:21,080
They're saying she did it to protect the mom, since she was already dying.

275
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,450
To be honest, I was rooting for that female serial killer...

276
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,600
So someone else killed them all?

277
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:31,610
It was San Ah's mom.

278
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,970
San Ah's mom...

279
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:40,430
That's why In Sook hid it, to protect San Ah.

280
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,380
But why didn't she tell us?

281
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,650
Did she think that we would go and tell the truth if we knew?

282
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:50,670
Then... what's the deal with the second murder?

283
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,890
Why would she have gone so far as to take the blame for that?

284
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,490
Who knows?

285
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,120
Do you really need to leave?

286
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,660
You don't look so good.

287
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,850
My mom moved, it's the first day.

288
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,580
Did your husband give the money?

289
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,670
Yeah. He got her a house, too.

290
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,810
What's his deal?

291
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,430
Since there's not much time.

292
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,120
I'll drop you off.

293
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,150
Why are we here?

294
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,150
They're pretty.

295
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,190
Are you planning on buying some?

296
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,440
Yeah.

297
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,330
Forget it.

298
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,310
- Why? 
 - I don't like flowers.

299
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,300
Why not?

300
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,760
Because I don't like watching them wilt.

301
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,180
Is there anything that doesn't wilt?

302
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,450
Everything that lives, wilts.

303
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:08,530
Right now, they're blooming.

304
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,050
It's the first time!

305
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:27,270
- What is? 
 - Living alone in a house this nice.

306
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,960
It's fascinating.

307
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:43,230
I opened a savings account in your name.

308
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,100
What?

309
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,780
Hey, this...

310
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,680
How could I accept this money?

311
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,610
Why would I accept this?

312
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:03,890
It's all in your name now.

313
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:08,370
You have to live on in your own name.

314
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:20,470
Unnie, I'll step out for a bit.

315
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:50,010
Ma'am...

316
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,520
Is my mom there?

317
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,250
You know where she is, don't you?

318
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,290
Se Yeon...

319
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,890
I remember,

320
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:19,270
every time your father threw a fit,

321
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,380
I pushed you forward.

322
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,170
 Get out of my way!

323
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,860
 - Take my socks off! 
 - Go to him.

324
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,760
 How scared you must have been, how much would you have hated it?

325
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:34,470
But since I couldn't handle it,

326
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:38,570
I did it because things got a little better if you went in.

327
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:42,740
But now that I think of it,

328
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,580
I pushed you forward like that

329
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:49,290
my whole life.

330
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,120
Asking you to live the way I wanted,

331
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,880
I pushed you forward.

332
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:05,020
Hey... what do I do?

333
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,950
What can be done?

334
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:14,710
What can be done now... you were born as my child...

335
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,900
Your whole life...

336
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,440
- You were born as my child... 
 - Don't cry.

337
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,830
What am I supposed to do if you cry?

338
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,570
What to do...

339
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:33,700
My child... My daughter...

340
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,790
When I first came here...

341
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,600
When you were sitting here alone,

342
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,860
why were you crying?

343
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,350
Because I just found out that my mom died.

344
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:08,040
I thought that she would have been out there somewhere.

345
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,260
I was fine with that thought alone.

346
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:16,810
"We'll meet at some point, right?"

347
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:22,250
"Where will we meet, how will we meet?" thoughts like that.

348
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,390
But he said that she's nowhere.

349
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,430
He said that she left first.

350
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:35,180
It felt like I was left alone in this world.

351
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:44,960
But then you came, crying like a fool.

352
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,890
Since we're here like this,

353
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:00,550
it feels like everything is starting again.

354
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,050
Again...

355
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:23,480
Grandma! Grandma!

356
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,990
It's all over, it's all right.

357
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:37,610
Grandma... I'm sorry.

358
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,780
For what?

359
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,820
I only got angry,

360
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:47,580
and couldn't say that I was sorry. I was worried that things might end like that.

361
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,890
When did you do something like that?

362
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:52,170
When did we ever do anything like that?

363
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:56,440
I just know, I know.

364
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:02,250
You! Why did you do that?

365
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,710
If this dummy says that she's going to do something like that, you should have stopped her!

366
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,850
How could you take the fall together, without saying a word?

367
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:14,970
What's gotten into your heads that would lead you to do something so scary?

368
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:19,440
I'm sorry, Grandma, for making you worry.

369
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,820
We won't do that anymore.

370
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,310
San Ah...

371
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,430
I'm sorry.

372
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,560
I'm the one who's sorry.

373
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,270
I knew,

374
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:52,380
but I couldn't say anything... because I was scared.

375
00:30:55,010 --> 00:31:00,030
If I were you, I wouldn't have said anything until the end.

376
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,740
I can wait.

377
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:07,310
I will wait patiently for my mom.

378
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,900
In Sook, please help. Se Yeon won't wake up!

379
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:45,560
I really thought she was dead.

380
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:50,010
I thought she just died like this.

381
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,150
It's okay.

382
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,980
No.

383
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,340
Not anymore, we're not okay.

384
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:03,180
She hasn't been like this for long.

385
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:07,130
She just became like this.

386
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:11,310
Soon, you and I...

387
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:13,870
We will become like this, too.

388
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,990
It's been difficult, hasn't it?

389
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,400
Why didn't you say something?

390
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,630
I'm sorry, I couldn't say anything.

391
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:48,380
Unnie, you said that you were going to see my wedding.

392
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,560
You should hurry and get up.

393
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,760
I can't go on without you.

394
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,880
- Mi Do... 
 - What?

395
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,320
Don't speak like you're giving your last words.

396
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,490
If you think that something is heavy,

397
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,560
just let it go.

398
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:17,040
Only after letting go, do you realize how great the burden you were carrying was.

399
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:22,980
Whether what I was carrying was light...

400
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,180
or heavy.

401
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,250
You sure are daring!

402
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,950
How could you think of taking the blame for a murder?

403
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:56,940
We knew from the beginning that it wasn't you guys, but is everything over now?

404
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,710
Yes.

405
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:01,450
- It's really over, right? 
 - Yes.

406
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:04,020
What's over? That guy who died on the beach,

407
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:07,760
who killed him? That has to be revealed for things to end!

408
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,780
- Right? 
 - Yeah.

409
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:14,920
It's you, right? It's because of you!

410
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,010
This is all because of you!

411
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:20,120
In Sook got swept up in some ridiculous murder case,

412
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,590
and had to go through all of this trouble, all because of you!

413
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:26,300
Y-Y-You, aren't you a hitman?

414
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,990
We didn't even know that,

415
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:33,390
and let you run away with our In Sook.

416
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:36,820
You asshole, what's your deal?

417
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,310
What are you doing?

418
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,560
- It's okay... 
 - It's okay? What is?

419
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,480
What's okay?

420
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,270
Where did you come from to be taking our In Sookâ€“

421
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:47,690
Since when has there been an "our"?

422
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:55,480
Since when have you and I been so close?

423
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,000
It's all because of him!

424
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,490
No. It's because of me.

425
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:04,010
I'm the one who planned to kill him, too.

426
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:07,720
Why? Why would you?

427
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,740
Because San Ah reminded me of myself.

428
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:14,210
Her not having parents to lean on, curled up keeping her feelings to herself,

429
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:20,000
holding it in, and pushing through... reminded me of myself. I wanted to protect her.

430
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,060
Why are you just now acting that way?

431
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:31,680
I think it's because you feel apologetic towards In Sook. All you have to do is say you're sorry.

432
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,300
"Were you hurting a lot all that time?"

433
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:38,700
"Was it difficult? I'm sorry."

434
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,340
All you have to say is that one thing.

435
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,170
I'm sorry.

436
00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:00,730
That time, I did that because I wanted to do something.

437
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:07,690
I wanted to do a good job, so I left you alone like that.

438
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:11,090
I couldn't do anything, could I?

439
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:17,480
Since I couldn't do anything, I couldn't come to get you.

440
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:23,090
I lost you that way. I lost everything.

441
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,190
I get it.

442
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,500
Just leave.

443
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,600
I'm sorry.

444
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,880
That phrase was too light, so I couldn't say it.

445
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:42,660
I'm sorry for that, too.

446
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:50,800
You wore a suit that you never wear, and it's been all wrinkled.

447
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:56,550
Today... is your mother's memorial day.

448
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,720
When I heard the news that you were set free,

449
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:04,260
I couldn't help but think that your mom was helping from above.

450
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:12,770
I came because I wanted to go together.

451
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,320
You come, too.

452
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,750
- Grandma. 
 - Eat it!

453
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,650
Eat it.

454
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,460
Is it good?

455
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,180
Yes.

456
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:20,350
But what do you like about In Sook?

457
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,300
Don't do things like that.

458
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:25,190
Well, sure, there's no reason when it comes to love.

459
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:27,480
But when it come to love, I'm the one!

460
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,980
Pyo Kang Seon. Even though I divorced her,

461
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,180
we had a really fiery love!

462
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,850
We fell in love at first sight!

463
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:36,860
You, do you know what falling at first sight is?

464
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,430
Yes. I did that, too.

465
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:44,750
When I first saw her, something strange...

466
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:49,560
Well, not strange, but rather sexy....

467
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,490
Sexyâ€“ I mean, what should I say?

468
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:53,400
Stop it.

469
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,060
Yeah, well, that's right! You get it.

470
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:59,490
That's the scary thing, you fell at first sight.

471
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:03,010
On that day, it was the day of the first snow, too.

472
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:06,060
The snowflakes were as big as my fists!

473
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:09,920
With all our energy, we ran all the way toâ€”

474
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,070
That's nothing to brag about.

475
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:18,310
Anyway, In Sook came to be on that day.

476
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,610
Wow, she came to be quite quickly, too. Didn't she?

477
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:38,130
This is a first for me.

478
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:43,150
- What? 
 - I ate out with my family once...

479
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,850
But that was the last time.

480
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,310
This is a first for us, too!

481
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:55,050
We went our whole lives without eating even a bite together.

482
00:39:55,050 --> 00:40:01,050
That's right. I'm not sure why we couldn't do this.

483
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:05,580
Mom, you need to eat more.

484
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,020
Look at you! You've gotten so thin!

485
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,040
No, no, I'll cook the meat.

486
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,250
Mom, you just eat.

487
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,950
All you need to do is pay at the end.

488
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:22,280
 In the middle of a Youtuber being arrested for charges of killing Bang Joon Seo through bodily injury,

489
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:27,170
 public sympathy for the wife of Ha Yong Geun, who confessed to murdering him, is spreading.

490
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:30,120
 The prosecution is conducting the investigation according to the murder charge,

491
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,420
 but for Miss Woo, who went through a long period of domestic abuse, her concrete situation...

492
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:36,580
If it's manslaughter, are the charges lighter?

493
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:41,380
Apparently, Se Yeon's girlfriend is defending her case.

494
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,240
Se Yeon requested it of her.

495
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,240
Is Se Yeon okay?

496
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,790
She's young so everything's fast.

497
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:53,230
In an old body like mine, cancer moves pretty slow.

498
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:57,150
The young ones get like that out of nowhere.

499
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,910
She won't be able to leave behind a photo.

500
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:02,010
Before Young Ji and Sung Hae left, we couldn't take one...

501
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,370
Why go through the trouble? We'll all be going up soon.

502
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:07,680
However you look at it, we're all separated from our families.

503
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,100
But we came here and made a new family.

504
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,370
So we should have a family photo.

505
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:21,200
What is it, Director?

506
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,390
That's right!

507
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:26,410
- What is? 
 - Love isn't a crime.

508
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:31,420
You lost so much weight praying all night!

509
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:34,340
I'm going crazy because of myself, too.

510
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:37,290
Why do I keep thinking of that face?

511
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:41,040
I'm picky about looks! But why...

512
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,380
is it that face?

513
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,830
Think it over to your heart's content.

514
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:50,980
Because when it comes to the lord, whatever choice you make, if it's love,

515
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,360
he says it's okay!

516
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,090
Are you going somewhere?

517
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:05,870
Our volunteer time is almost over. We need to start getting ready now.

518
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:08,930
Why are you packing up so soon though?

519
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,270
But why do I not want to leave?

520
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,840
I was sick and tired of cleaning up after the patients here.

521
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,660
- What? You liked it. 
 - Me?

522
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,070
When you first came here,

523
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:22,930
your eyes were dead like a fish. You looked like a loser who had no will to live.

524
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:26,370
Thanks to you coming here, I can finally see some life in your eyes.

525
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:29,850
What about you then? You were a sad sight to look at.

526
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:34,930
You were always angry towards everyone. But you're acting like a hotel chef nowadays.

527
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:38,780
Everyone was like that. Their bones healed after they came here.

528
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,580
What do you mean?

529
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:45,960
In a primal environment, you can't survive with a broken leg.

530
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,250
But the bones healing means...

531
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:53,220
that someone stayed beside them and helped to heal and cure the wound.

532
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:58,200
That's how civilization starts.

533
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,510
I think my bones healed, too.

534
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:02,210
Good.

535
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:24,310
Why do you suddenly want to take a picture? It feels like we're taking a portrait for our funeral.

536
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,070
Hey.

537
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,840
Oh?

538
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,340
- What are you doing? 
 - What?

539
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,550
You have never styled hair before, right?

540
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,640
All right, Ma'am. What would you like?

541
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:44,260
Sexy, cutie, pretty?

542
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,060
 Hurry up.

543
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,820
 My goodness.

544
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,750
 My goodness. Sit down.

545
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,830
There you are. Sit down so we can take a picture.

546
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:58,990
No, it's fine. I'm not a part of this family anyway and I'm on duty.

547
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:00,960
You blend in pretty well so hurry up and sit, so we can take the photo.

548
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,660
- You blend in pretty well. 
 - Come in.

549
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:09,830
- Where is Min Woo Cheon? 
 - Oh, here he is.

550
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:18,200
â™«  A long night  â™«

551
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,920
What is that?

552
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,100
- Couple's outfit. 
 - No!

553
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:27,790
- Woo Cheon! 
 - Incredible.

554
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:31,860
 - My goodness, my goodness. 
 - Quickly change so we can take the picture.

555
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:35,040
 - My goodness. 
 - My goodness, seriously?

556
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,710
It's a heart.

557
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:47,680
â™«  All the moments we drew together  â™«

558
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:58,150
â™«  Can never be erased  â™«

559
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,960
Cheese!

560
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:19,420
â™«  I miss you  â™«

561
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:23,970
 All right.

562
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:26,390
Smile!

563
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:31,860
Was it really caught?

564
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,000
Yes, it was caught on the black box.

565
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,080
It's this woman, right?

566
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:41,580
Yes! It's her!

567
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,930
Does that mean we can get the money back?

568
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:46,520
Not just that, we'll have her locked up in prison.

569
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:50,750
Of course. This detective will do everything.

570
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:54,660
I'm glad. It's okay now.

571
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:58,800
Did you stay up all night to find this even with your busy schedule?

572
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,680
It's okay if I lose sleep for a few days.

573
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,090
I was so worried that you may lose sleep instead.

574
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,080
That's what kept you busy, I see.

575
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,890
Just a moment.

576
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,790
Why are you here, Team Leader?

577
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:29,870
I oddly feel comfortable staying here.

578
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,860
I don't think now is the time for you to be sitting around eating mandarins.

579
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,580
Isn't that the same case for you?

580
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:38,170
This is sort of like an extension of my work.

581
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,490
Mom?

582
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:52,460
Mi Do.

583
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:12,120
Have you been well, Mom?

584
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:18,770
Are you really getting married?

585
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,330
Yes.

586
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:24,530
Does he really like you?

587
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:29,040
Yes.

588
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,660
Is that so? Then...

589
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,990
Could I perhaps...

590
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:42,560
borrow some money from you?

591
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:45,800
I got scammed.

592
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,350
I tried to set things right again...

593
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:53,990
but here I am now.

594
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:56,790
- Why? 
 - What?

595
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:01,170
After I was diagnosed with a terminal illness...

596
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,100
it's the first time I saw you since I came here.

597
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,880
But that is the first thing you say to me?

598
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:14,350
- Why is it that? 
 - Forget it, if you don't want to.

599
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:23,110
No matter how much you hate me

600
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:27,750
or dislike me, I tried to understand.

601
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:33,340
Because I was bad. I hurt you.

602
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,180
But now...

603
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,360
I'm going to die soon.

604
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:46,440
Your daughter is going to die...

605
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,690
but you come all the way here to talk about money?

606
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:55,560
- That's pretty harsh. 
 - Everything is a lie with you.

607
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:00,060
Just like when Mi Woong died, too.

608
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,490
Everything is always a lie to you!!

609
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:09,030
Announcing everywhere that you're dying.

610
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:11,730
I couldn't believe any of that.

611
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:18,620
A lie?

612
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:23,330
Lie? Even if it was a lie,

613
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:29,750
shouldn't you be worried before anything when you hear that your child is going to die?

614
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:33,190
How can a mom act like this?

615
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:35,490
If I love you...

616
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,310
I would feel so bad...

617
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:42,980
towards Mi Woong.

618
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,420
Forget it.

619
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,380
I'm not a young kid who wants your love anymore.

620
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:04,060
Doing whatever I can to get your attention,

621
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:06,240
being anxious,

622
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,550
and suffering.

623
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:11,670
I want to stop that now.

624
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:20,010
Just leave. I want to let everything go now.

625
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:24,760
It's all over now.

626
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,630
What happened? What did your mom say?

627
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,170
I let go.

628
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:45,810
What?

629
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:53,990
It's true. Now that I let it go, it wasn't even a big deal.

630
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,020
Sin Tae Il wasn't alone.

631
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:22,210
He's on the move with another person.

632
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,270
Ha Yong Geun's cellphone is in Koo Ji Pyo's hands now.

633
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:29,050
The video wasn't backed up anywhere either.

634
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:32,490
But Tae Il said he had that video.

635
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:36,020
I wonder who has that video?

636
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:39,350
What can that person do with that video?

637
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:43,040
There's only money.

638
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:46,910
The person is probably coming in contact with Koo Ji Pyo.

639
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:55,990
We're getting ch-chased.

640
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:58,260
Then, why would you come here?

641
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:01,050
I thought our deal was done.

642
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:06,240
Send me abroad. I'm being tracked by the police, so I can't leave the country.

643
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:09,420
So what do you want me to do, darn it?

644
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,260
Your company's private plane.

645
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:15,840
Take me to where my f-family is.

646
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,850
If I get caught, it's over for y-you, too.

647
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:27,350
- I told you to go over there. 
 - What's wrong with her?

648
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:29,260
- Don't hit me! 
 - Gosh!

649
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:38,330
It's not enough space.

650
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:45,630
I'm reminded of my college days now.

651
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:53,490
My time at the dormitory was the best.

652
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:56,780
When were you the happiest, Mi Do?

653
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,500
There was one time...

654
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:08,850
my mom smiled at me.

655
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:12,590
I don't know what I did that made her smile.

656
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:18,310
I wanted to make her smile again, but no matter how much I tried to remember what it was, I couldn't remember.

657
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:24,760
I'm sure your mom loved you a lot.

658
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:30,930
If I think about it, I think it was the same for my mom, too.

659
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:38,100
When were you the happiest?

660
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:42,060
For me, it's now.

661
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:45,760
Liar. You meant to say when you're with Woo Cheon.

662
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,770
You're wrong.

663
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,400
Yesterday...

664
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:56,740
I saw the sea.

665
00:53:57,950 --> 00:54:03,120
 The three of us were running towards the sea.

666
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,700
Did you see the green ray?

667
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,290
No.

668
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:22,340
Do you want to go to the sea?

669
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:23,990
Yes.

670
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,370
I want to go to the sea.

671
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:32,750
If...

672
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:37,130
tomorrow comes.

673
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:59,590
You're going to go to the sea?

674
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:02,890
Yes. It's Se Yeon's wish.

675
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:07,300
Se Yeon's body may not be able to survive it.

676
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,360
We still want to go.

677
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:17,950
I can't only send three patients.

678
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:24,320
It won't be easy to take care of three women.

679
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,460
I ask that you will take good care of them.

680
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,920
Yes, don't worry.

681
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:36,680
Have a good trip. I'll see you back here.

682
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,440
Okay.

683
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:41,850
Se Yeon.

684
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,730
Come back safely from your trip.

685
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:51,320
Okay.

686
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:08,820
We'll come back safely. Don't worry.

687
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:22,120
Stop it, old grandma. They said it's just a trip.

688
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:29,370
Let's go now.

689
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:43,850
Thank you.

690
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:46,720
Thank you.

691
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,630
I felt so warm...

692
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:53,890
while I was here.

693
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:57,630
I'll come back safely.

694
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:39,490
- Do you remember? 
 - What?

695
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:45,590
The day we ran away to go see the green ray.

696
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,930
That seems like ages ago.

697
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:53,700
When you first got caught, we thought you'd turn on us, so we tried to run away.

698
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,470
Oh, that time?

699
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:58,490
It was really nice that time.

700
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:02,050
- What was? 
 - That was our beginning.

701
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:04,770
- We had our first kissâ€” 
 - Hey!

702
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:09,920
You two are ridiculous. I thought the two of you were really crazy.

703
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,310
In the middle of the hospice, gosh.

704
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:15,430
- That wasn't a real kissâ€” 
 - It was a real kiss.

705
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:17,370
That's right. You were feeling it then.

706
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:20,090
- Hey, no! 
 - Then, when was your first kiss?

707
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:23,060
- That was when we went on the picnicâ€” 
 - Hey!

708
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:26,680
What's wrong with them? Goodness.

709
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,740
I didn't like the sea.

710
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:01,730
So at some point, whenever I came to the seaside,

711
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:04,810
I would only look down at my feet.

712
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:07,080
But now that I'm looking at it...

713
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,770
my mind has gone blank.

714
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:15,490
I think that's why I like the sea.

715
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:20,900
My mind goes blank whenever I'm in front of the sea.

716
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:24,010
I guess it swallows up my thoughts.

717
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:26,100
Fear too.

718
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:31,740
- Are you scared? 
 - No.

719
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:37,630
Why do people fear death?

720
00:59:37,630 --> 00:59:40,000
Because they don't know what it is.

721
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:44,660
They only know how to live.

722
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:48,780
All humans cry when they are born.

723
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:51,390
That time, they don't know what living is.

724
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:54,200
So they cry out of fear?

725
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,250
I guess that's the reason.

726
00:59:57,770 --> 00:59:59,660
I...

727
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:03,440
have a lot of fear.

728
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:08,910
That's why I was always scared of starting something new.

729
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:12,300
Not knowing is scary.

730
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:19,850
So I struggled with starting things.

731
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:26,750
But I always did well if I started.

732
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:35,050
I think I can do well.

733
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:02,390
It's the green ray.

734
01:01:37,290 --> 01:01:39,490
You're right.

735
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,680
It really is.

736
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:56,320
It's the color of Heaven.

737
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:33,770

738
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:40,440

739
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:44,510
â™«  Is there a reason behind it  â™«

740
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:52,500
â™«  Just because it's red, just because it's pretty  â™«

741
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:59,340
â™«  That's why it resembles you  â™«

742
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:05,070
â™«  Your name is in my heart  â™«

743
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:11,040
â™«  I hold my breath  â™«

744
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:17,340
â™«  I close my eyes  â™«
