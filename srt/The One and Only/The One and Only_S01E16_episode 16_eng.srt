1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,280
 There's a movie about one's disappearance even from the afterlife

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,680
 when no more people on the planet are alive to remember you.

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:22,120
 Maybe life is all about memories.

4
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,620
 Me in someone's memory,

5
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,820
 or someone in my memory.

6
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,380
 I think everyone lives

7
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,860
 and breathes with different faces

8
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,010
 in each memory..

9
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,960
 Will I disappear?

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,770
 Or will I stay?

11
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:59,640

12
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:07,980

13
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,320

14
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,650

15
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,050
Did you do that?

16
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,580
- Sorry? 
 - Why did you take out Se Yeon's name?

17
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,240
She's not here anymore.

18
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,510
What? How can you say that?

19
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,230
Why are you in such a hurry to remove her name?

20
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,350
I'm not ready to send her yet.

21
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,740
Why are you already treating her like someone who doesn't exist?

22
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,480
I guess you'd remove my name immediately after I die, too.

23
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,640
Since In Sook and I are disappearing soon.

24
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,970
Why are you crying? It's not a sad thing.

25
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,230
You're such a heartless person.

26
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,070
How can you say that they're gone as if nothing's wrong?

27
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,310
They're here.

28
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,560
What is that?

29
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,440
I... remember all

30
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,390
these names and faces.

31
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,930

32
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,960
It's all in my memory.

33
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,350
Even though they're not here.

34
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,600
What is this?

35
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,620
It's not even Death Note. 
  (Referring to the Japanese manga/anime)

36
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:36,710
Unnie... how is your trip?

37
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,120
Heaven is too far...

38
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,290
so it takes a bit of time. Right?

39
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,270
What is this?

40
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,260
What should I do?

41
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,420
What'll you do?

42
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,370
Even for me, it's so hard and I'm in so much pain.

43
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:43,170
What'll you do after you're left alone?

44
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,240
I remember it so vividly.

45
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,850
All the memories left in my heart

46
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,570
are hurting me so.

47
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,320
You're going to feel the same way.

48
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,210
If I'm not there, you'll hold onto those...

49
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,740
memories and suffer.

50
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,700
I won't suffer.

51
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:36,040
I'll pick one of those memories every day...

52
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:44,610
and reflect on the best scenes.

53
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,390
I'm going to cherish them.

54
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,590
I'm going to enjoy it.

55
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,920
Since it's mine.

56
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,230
What is this?

57
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,800
It's a billion won. Hurry up and post it.

58
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,490
This is Koo Ji Pyo's video and it's gone viral on the internet.

59
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,940
Who uploaded it?

60
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,510
Sung Mi Do.

61
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:31,580
 -   
 -

62
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,590

63
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,130

64
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,540
Are you okay?

65
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,140
Was it... you?

66
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,960
 What are you talking about?

67
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,970
 Let's end it here.

68
00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:00,230
 The guy who killed Park Doo Jin is dead anyway. Then there's no evidence.

69
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,700
 Let's not fight anymore and end it here.

70
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,400
 I can't do that. I'll find the video.

71
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,330
 That won't count as evidence for the murder.

72
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,740
 But it's a motive for murder.

73
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,390
 If Koo Ji Pyo gets caught...

74
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,440
 the truth about how you received a murder request from him will come to light. There will be no way out for you then.

75
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,060
 If I'm wrong, I'll handle it myself.

76
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,150
You should've told me. Really.

77
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,230
Then I could make my own decision.

78
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,300
Why are you doing something stupid,

79
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,980
like thinking by yourself and taking it upon yourself?

80
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,420
Have you known it all along?

81
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,420
I wanted to deny it.

82
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,840
I didn't want to know.

83
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:47,380
But when I got to know him, after facing it,

84
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,190
it didn't hurt.

85
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,810
 It was you.

86
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:01,180
 Killing Park Doo Jin and letting them know about In Sook's whereabouts. It was all you.

87
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,320
 Just to hide that one video.

88
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,950
 Who said that?

89
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:09,760
 Pyo In Sook? Min Woo Cheon? Do you really believe that?

90
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,830
 Let me ask you one thing.

91
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,100
 Were you at least sincere about me?

92
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,620
 Or did you just want to use me?

93
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,120
 Did you really love me?

94
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,900
 Didn't you fall for me because I'm an heir and someone that everyone looks up to?

95
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,160
 Fine. Being calculative is not a bad thing.

96
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,550
 But you need to find the answer if you started it.

97
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:36,940
 So if you just shut your mouth, I'll do whatever I can to get the situation under control.

98
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,050
 You just need to wait a little more and we'll get a happy ending.

99
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,310
 Happy ending, my foot.

100
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:49,450
 Have you ever been hurt because of me?

101
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,930
 You never once hurt because of me, right?

102
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,250
 Neither have I.

103
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,400
 It doesn't hurt as much as I thought it would.

104
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,090
Why didn't you tell me?

105
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:07,590
It was so pathetic till the end.

106
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:11,400
Even my last love was so pathetic.

107
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,990
No.

108
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:18,250
I know that it's not my fault.

109
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:23,410
I thought about it while sending Se Yeon.

110
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:28,390
Everything I was holding was so light

111
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:32,810
and wasted. That's why I let it go.

112
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,940
Now is the time.

113
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,830
We need to lock Koo Ji Pyo up and end this.

114
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,090
But we can't find a single lead on Sin Tae Il's whereabouts.

115
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,320
His phone is off, too.

116
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,540
He'll start making a move, now that the video has gone viral.

117
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,760
That won't be easy for him.

118
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,110
There are eyes that are watching him.

119
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,510
Although Koo Ji Pyo will probably insist it's not him.

120
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:10,190
Tie him down with Narae's Cleaning's business transaction for now.

121
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:14,660
I will confess. So use me to catch him.

122
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,810
You can't do that yet.

123
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,560
We have no evidence right now since Park Seung Sun is dead.

124
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,570
For now...

125
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,030
That person is alive.

126
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,950
The man you showed me a picture of last time.

127
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,610
I saw him.

128
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:45,610
Ji Pyo handed over a bag of money to him.

129
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,870
He probably threatened him with the video for it.

130
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,270
Then we probably don't have much time now.

131
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,800
You know it yourself.

132
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,010
My sins can't disappear.

133
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,320
So I have to pay for it.

134
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,840
- Butâ€” 
 - I know.

135
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,210
The fact that it's now, hurts me a lot too.

136
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,360
You can't.

137
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,160
Not right now.

138
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,670
You saved me.

139
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,470
But I lived like that.

140
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,670
Then you appeared in front of me again.

141
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:06,240
That's why I got another chance.

142
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,160
A chance to start anew.

143
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,980
 A video that's gone viral on the internet has caused an uproar.

144
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,450
Didn't I tell you? His energy wasn't good.

145
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,980
Why is something that's newsworthy...

146
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:49,710
happening to the kids in the Green Ray room.

147
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,290
Why are you two lying around here instead of eating?

148
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,280
I have no appetite these days.

149
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,110
You still have to eat.

150
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:03,870
- It'll go away once you eat. 
 - You shouldn't skip meals yourself.

151
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,900
- You've gotten skinny. 
 - Gosh.

152
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,590
Why aren't you ladies getting surgery?

153
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,800
There's chemo, too.

154
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,440
I relapsed.

155
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,020
Once it did, I figured what's the point of doing more.

156
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,910
They told me I'm inoperable.

157
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,970
No, they said they won't operate on me.

158
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,800
Isn't In Sook the same case as me?

159
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,780
They said her chances are low.

160
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,350
She was told that operation may be more dangerous,

161
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,100
so they said she can't.

162
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,180
I looked around...

163
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:35,910
when one place asked if she'd like to try.

164
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,230
But they can't guarantee anything either.

165
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,090
- You're not being scammed again, are you? 
 - Gosh.

166
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,980
Don't say that.

167
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,200
But In Sook won't even let me talk to them.

168
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,620
I'm scared, too.

169
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:54,480
If she dies during surgery, I'm afraid it'll haunt me forever.

170
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,130
I also wonder if it's right...

171
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:01,340
for her to spend her remaining time in pain like that.

172
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,920
Nor do we have the money.

173
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,730
Gosh, isn't it strange?

174
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:11,290
That people need money even in a life or death situation?

175
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,270
Can you step out for a moment?

176
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,500
- Why did you come to work? 
 - Father.

177
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,410
Help me. It's not like that video can prove anything.

178
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,740
There's definitely a way for me to get out. You're good at it!

179
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,220
Something minor just blew up.

180
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,300
I tried to stop it myself, but...

181
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,210
You killed a person.

182
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,430
You thought I didn't know anything?

183
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:04,250
You crossed the line. Do I have to cross it, too?

184
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,740
Father, all of this...

185
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,130
it's all your fault in the end! Your fault!

186
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,430
Shut up!

187
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,250
The most stupid guy in the world is one that blames his parents.

188
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,020
I always told you.

189
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,890
Don't try to benefit from your parents or try to blame them.

190
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,450
I said I don't need that kind of child!

191
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,640
Did I do the right thing?

192
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,420
If Ji Pyo gets caught, Woo Cheon will get involved, too. Right?

193
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,280
How strange.

194
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,090
Why do I keep making you suffer?

195
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,640
What was our relationship in our past lives?

196
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,430
Romantic rivals.

197
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,290
Romantic rivals?

198
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,620
Hey, you think you're even a match for me?

199
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,600
- What, so we're fighting for Woo Cheon then? 
 - Yes.

200
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,270
I won.

201
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:24,270
Which is why you held a grudge and appeared in this lifeâ€”

202
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:29,300
What are you saying? Regardless, you two are a match made in heaven.

203
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,720
Think about it. We all met together at first.

204
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,360
The fact that he fell for you instead of me...

205
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,270
it means that's true love.

206
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:43,190
So, in the next life...

207
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,100
there's no such thing as a next life. I don't believe in that.

208
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:55,430
Which is why, you have to do everything in this life.

209
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,390
Okay?

210
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,660
Do everything! Okay?

211
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,890
- I thought we were going to go watch a movie. 
 - We are watching a movie.

212
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:30,140
Do we really have to watch something so bloody with all the killing?

213
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,950
There are romantic movies and stuff, too.

214
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,280
Why would we watch other people dating?

215
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,540
We're doing it ourselves.

216
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:24,350
What about Koo Ji Pyo? The guy who took the fall as the administrator of Hello Video already served his time and got out.

217
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,220
Would he speak the truth now when he's probably received money from him?

218
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,470
It's not over. The US Ministry of Justice requested his extradition.

219
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:34,370
You think he'd go to the US and serve a hundred-year sentence or confess to us?

220
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,560
What about Park Seung Sun?

221
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,110
- Did the henchmen give you anything? 
 - Yes, he's in Korea now.

222
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,230
I think he's moving with Sin Tae Il.

223
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,000
Koo Ji Pyo will make a move.

224
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,120
No. I've blocked it so that he can't even approach them.

225
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,140
What is this, Park Seung Sun?

226
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,840
They have a lead on us.

227
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,140
I think I'll have to ride on that private plane.

228
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,890
We're one body from now, all right?

229
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:12,280
- What about Sin Tae Il? 
 - I don't know. He didn't come at our promised time.

230
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,590
He probably got caught already.

231
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,340
- Hey, let's go. 
 - Why would I go with you?

232
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,060
- We're in this mess because of you, you bastard! 
 - How dare you to call me that, you bastard!

233
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,010
And why is this all because of me? It's because of you!

234
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,490
Why did you screw up and kill someone?

235
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,530
Think about it a little if you have a brain.

236
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:31,180
You're the worst scumbag out of everyone.

237
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,520
Why are you acting different? You're scaring me.

238
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,700
The sunlight hit you for five seconds and you looked really handsome.

239
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,690
- Five seconds? 
 - Yes.

240
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,600
What about now?

241
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:42,080
Never in my life did you feed me food.

242
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,720
You smile so well, too.

243
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,320
How did you live all your life without smiling when you're that good at it?

244
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,080
Here.

245
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,980
You too.

246
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:09,550
Why did you offer to dye my hair all of a sudden?

247
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,600
You used to ask me to dye it in the past.

248
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,020
- You hated it. 
 - I didn't like it then.

249
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,150
Didn't like what?

250
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:19,010
I didn't get why you had to dye your gray hair black.

251
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:23,290
I didn't like how all the grandmas had the same dyed hair.

252
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:28,230
It's because we don't like that people can see all the time that has passed.

253
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:32,280
We don't like the time passing.

254
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,690
Why?

255
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:37,140
It's time that you survived for so long.

256
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,440
It shows those times.

257
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,510
Right. You are right.

258
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:47,570
They are those times, but we try to erase them.

259
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:55,520
I want to walk around gray-haired with In Sook later when I'm old.

260
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,610
All gray.

261
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,910
Until your roots turn gray?

262
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,700
Oh, that's what that meant.

263
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:10,010
I... once... tried to die.

264
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:13,470
Life was too tough.

265
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,860
No matter how much I tried, it just didn't work out.

266
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:21,650
One day, I stood blankly by a river.

267
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,870
Next thing, I was walking in with my shoes off.

268
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:31,850
But suddenly, your father Gang Sun's face popped up.

269
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:36,990
I couldn't die once that face popped up.

270
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:39,740
So I survived it.

271
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,980
That is life for everyone.

272
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:49,010
You live for others. You live because of others.

273
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:54,950
When I see the two of you together and smiling like this...

274
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:58,000
it wears my heart out.

275
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,480
- In Sook. 
 - Yes?

276
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:11,210
You should live like that, too. Live for others.

277
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:14,850
Look at him. Take a look at his eyes.

278
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:17,190
Live for Woo Cheon.

279
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:20,710
Try getting surgery and try out chemo, too.

280
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,340
Grandma, that'sâ€”

281
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:27,470
I know! It's scary. You don't know if the surgery could go wrong.

282
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:31,380
You get the surgery, only to be told that your condition is worse.

283
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,590
But let's still try.

284
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:37,390
We're just trying something new. No big deal!

285
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:42,310
Let's try. Let's try whatever we can.

286
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:46,980
Grandma Cheon Deok gave us money. She gave us a big amount.

287
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,540
She wants you to try what she couldn't.

288
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:55,130
It's shameless of me, but I'm going to take that money.

289
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,630
If that means you can get better...

290
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:02,030
I'm going to work until my back breaks and pay her back.

291
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:06,910
As long as I have you... if I have you...

292
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:10,350
I can do anything.

293
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,650
Okay?

294
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,930

295
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,070
It's over.

296
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,820
It's all over now.

297
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,730
It's done.

298
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,190
This is the last time, Woo Cheon.

299
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,750

300
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:00,280

301
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,350

302
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,130
 LE Group's private plane.

303
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,260

304
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,590
LE Group! The terminal for private planes.

305
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:20,050
They are going that way. Hurry up.

306
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,910
We can't lose them.

307
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,570
Okay, yes. All right.

308
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,080
They got a signal from Sin Tae Il's cellphone.

309
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,880
- Around the airport? 
 - No, around here.

310
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:34,620
Spread out! Hurry up and spread out.

311
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,990

312
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:03,880
Is it over now?

313
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,800
Yes.

314
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,080
What should we do?

315
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,800
What should we?

316
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,340
What can we do?

317
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,690
Whatever.

318
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:38,060
Shall we run away?

319
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,400
No.

320
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,360
Then?

321
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,660
Let's go to my house.

322
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:02,620
This is what your room looks like.

323
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:08,220
Yes. You are the first.

324
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,260
Nobody else ever came.

325
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,510
This...

326
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,210
I brought it.

327
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,210
When?

328
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:27,430
It's yours, so I wanted you to sit on it.

329
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,970
So you can sit and rest.

330
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,360
- Sit down. 
 - Okay.

331
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:51,470
I guess you never cooked anything before?

332
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:57,100
No. This place felt like a prison.

333
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:02,140
But it's different with you over there.

334
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,670
Everything is changing.

335
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,770
Take a good look while you wait.

336
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:18,360
Okay.

337
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,620
It would be nice for you to grow a plant.

338
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:26,120
This place gets a lot of sunlight, so it'll grow well.

339
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:32,820
 I lived with the curtains closed all the time, so I didn't know.

340
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,220
Shall we hang our picture, too?

341
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,530
 Even if it's a little silly.

342
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,290
 White for the blankets.

343
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:53,430
 My grandma didn't like white. She said it was hard to wash.

344
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:56,870
 That's why everything was colorful and drab.

345
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:01,370
 I'm going to get a very white blanket.

346
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:05,740
Then we'll get matching white pajamas.

347
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:11,170
 Whenever we wake up in the morning...

348
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:14,900
 you'll be in front of my eyes.

349
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,700
What is all this?

350
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,510
In Sook isn't here.

351
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,050
I know!

352
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:53,510
- I brought it for you. 
 - Gosh!

353
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,940
- It looks delicious. 
 - My goodness.

354
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:58,060
Me and you. We do this because there's a void.

355
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,760
That's why we gather everything we can.

356
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:06,000
I pick up trash and you buy whatever you can.

357
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:14,640
- It's hot! Gosh, it's hot. 
 - My goodness.

358
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,620
- Gosh, your temper. 
 - What?

359
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,130
That's my name.

360
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:22,030
- Sung Mi Do? 
 - Yes. 
  (T/N: Sung Mi Do sounds like the word for "temper")

361
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,660
Is that so?

362
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:29,790
This is really delicious! What kimchi did you use to make it?

363
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:33,120
What else? I used my kimchi.

364
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,770
I like pajeon, too. Can't you make me that, too?

365
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:40,700
How are you the polar opposite of In Sook?

366
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,710
Every person is different.

367
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:48,350
If you were my granddaughter, it would've been easier mentally.

368
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:53,220
You just yell and talk about everything.

369
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:02,360
But I never did that with my mom either.

370
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:16,500
You're not going to try to get surgery or anything?

371
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,190
Well, I tried.

372
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:23,780
I went to all sorts of places every day.

373
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:27,550
One hospital today and another tomorrow.

374
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:31,260
But they all said they couldn't.

375
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:38,990
Grandma, I want to live too.

376
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,860
All humans feel that way.

377
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,960
But they said I couldn't.

378
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:51,030
If they say that...

379
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,070
I want to live, too.

380
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:16,650
You pretty thing.

381
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,070
Thank you.

382
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:38,950
Every person has at least one person.

383
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:42,450
But I didn't have one.

384
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:44,790
I was always alone.

385
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:50,160
That felt so normal.

386
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:57,230
So I wasn't lonely. But I was wrong.

387
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:02,630
I bought a big teddy bear one day.

388
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,280

389
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,570
But I threw it away.

390
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:20,260
Because I didn't like how I was feeling lonely.

391
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,740
Is it...

392
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,830
Did you ever think this?

393
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:50,220
How often coincidences are repeated...

394
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,720
for us to meet the one.

395
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,900
 Why do you pick this stuff up?

396
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,200
Maybe they meet against all the odds.

397
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,630
The thought that that's how you become the one for one another.

398
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:13,940
Maybe life can only be saved by that one and only.

399
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:38,000

400
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,700
Shall we go together?

401
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,840
Shall we die together?

402
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:04,220
I said I would be with you...

403
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,690
until the very end.

404
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,350
I don't think I can live without you.

405
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:21,760
I don't want to do that anymore.

406
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,360
Can't you wait for me?

407
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:29,700
Could you not wait for me?

408
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,680
Endure.

409
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,790
Push it back.

410
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:39,400
Can't you live?

411
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:50,770
I don't want to get my hopes up anymore.

412
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:53,610
I don't want to get greedy.

413
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,670
I'm scared.

414
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:01,230
Be greedy.

415
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,730
Get your hopes up and walk.

416
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,920
One year... One month.

417
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,640
No, even if you can live for just one more day.

418
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,560
Get the surgery, okay?

419
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,120
Let's try whatever we can.

420
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,030
So that I can be by your side...

421
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:28,440
until the very end.

422
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:32,800
Can't you do that for me?

423
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,160
I will wait.

424
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,530
I'm going to wait.

425
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:29,640
Whatever it takes.

426
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,340
I will wait.

427
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:26,440
 People are shocked to learn that Vice-President Koo Ji Pyo was behind the murders of Ha Yong Geun and Park Doo Jin.

428
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:31,140
 I only did as I was told! Koo Ji Pyo wanted to hide that video.

429
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,260
 So he told me to make up the "Moss Flower Serial Murder" story.

430
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:37,740
- Gosh. 
  - That's why I murdered Park Doo Jin.

431
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:43,260
 - But this punk tried to kill me! 
  - What a strange case. One that was made from social lunacy and anger.

432
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,370
A serial murder of all things.

433
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:50,520
Seriously. They were all different culprits. They almost took the fall for everything.

434
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:55,010
Pyo In Sook and Min Woo Cheon suffered for nothing.

435
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:58,600
It's a strange world. Why do they cause a ruckus like that?

436
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,760
As a person who is about to die, I don't really get it.

437
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,440
Why do you continue to stay silent when you turned yourself in?

438
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:11,560
Until I admit to everything and tell you the truth...

439
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:18,000
Woo Cheon has some time, right?

440
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:31,460
â™«  I'm staying here  â™«

441
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:39,100
â™«  I'm staying here. Here I am  â™«

442
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:46,490
â™«  I'll stop here. I will not leave  â™«

443
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:50,060
â™«  I'm staying here  â™«

444
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:58,260
â™«  Hold me a little more  â™«

445
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:05,110
â™«  I hope you will stay by me  â™«

446
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:16,330

447
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:29,170
You really don't know what can happen in life.

448
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:31,710
Grandma Cheon Duk you're a senior...

449
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:34,080
in... influantâ€”

450
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,920
- Inflation. 
 - Yes!

451
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,340
Who would have known...

452
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,800
that you would get so popular through that.

453
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,600
Your son visited you thanks to that.

454
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,560
Now you can go to the US,

455
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,130
and with your son by your side...

456
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:47,800
I can die next to him.

457
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,490
Gosh, you can't just go like that.

458
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:54,220
- I have to pay you back. 
 - Gosh!

459
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,840
What need for money would I have now?

460
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,720
It's all good for me now.

461
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,990
The fact that things played out this way at the very end of my life...

462
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:05,120
you have no idea how glad I am.

463
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:10,440
Gosh, you should be thanking Mi Do. Here she comes right on time. Mi Do!

464
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,370
How are you today?

465
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:23,420
I'm good.

466
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:27,460
Good. You'll get even better.

467
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:31,650
Mi Do, thank you so much.

468
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,830
I didn't do anything.

469
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:37,500
Who would've known I would shine at the end of my life?

470
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,830
I hit the jackpot thanks to you.

471
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:45,820
But you gave all the money to In Sook instead.

472
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:49,430
Thank you...

473
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:51,900
for giving me the surgery money.

474
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:56,110
If you're really grateful, you better make the money worth it.

475
00:43:56,110 --> 00:44:00,510
You have to live. You have to get better, all right?

476
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:08,330
You are not dead,

477
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:10,840
until you die.

478
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,120
What are you saying?

479
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,170
I'm just saying.

480
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:20,440
What's up with you? Why are about to cry after saying something strange?

481
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,780
It's because I can't do anything for you.

482
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:36,230
- But where is Se Yeon? 
 - What?

483
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:39,400
She was here just a moment ago.

484
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,550
Where is Se Yeon?

485
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:47,200
She...

486
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,430
died.

487
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:51,730
What are you saying?

488
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:55,380
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

489
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:58,600
Why are you being like this?

490
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:07,290
You really can't remember? You can't remember Se Yeon's last day?

491
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:09,920
We went to the beach together.

492
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,790
Remember it! Try to remember it.

493
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:17,360
Are you going to forget me, too?

494
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,370
You have to remember.

495
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:25,100
You have to survive and remember me after I die.

496
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:30,840
I will remember.

497
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,330
What about the first time we met?

498
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:36,210
Do you remember the first time we met?

499
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:42,540
We fought here.

500
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,510
That's right.

501
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:48,610
What about the time you went to go save San Ah?

502
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:54,890
What about Woo Cheon then? You don't remember him?

503
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,940
I remember him.

504
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,380
I will remember.

505
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:10,570
I will remember.

506
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:15,620
I will remember.

507
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,370
I will remember.

508
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:27,460
They said you may suffer some memory loss right after your surgery.

509
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:31,160
That means I can get better, right?

510
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,590
They tried to remove the brain tumor as much as they could.

511
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:40,490
But part of the temporal lobe is related to language, so they couldn't remove everything.

512
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:43,630
That may be why you're experiencing memory loss.

513
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:48,420
Are you saying I'll lose more of my memory over time?

514
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:53,490
We'll have to keep an eye on your condition and get a diagnosis from the hospital.

515
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:58,370
What is left behind if I lose my memory?

516
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:01,140
What do I have to do? What can I do?

517
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:05,080
There's an old saying in Russian.

518
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,700
Pray to God.

519
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:12,250
But don't stop moving your hand

520
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:14,910
that is rowing towards the land.

521
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:43,210
You still carry on living.

522
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:06,620
 I was like an alley cat.

523
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,710
 Hey, come at me! Try me!

524
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:12,180
 - Even if you die? 
 - Let go!

525
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,890
 What are you doing? You're a shameless thief!

526
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:17,360
 They say the reason why alley cats have their guard up so much...

527
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,590
 Mom!

528
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:22,270
 ...is because of the bad memories that their bodies remember.

529
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:24,650
 Hey, are you a kidnapper?!

530
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:26,420
 We can just throw it away.

531
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:28,010
 I was like that.

532
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:29,790
 Don't think that you were alone.

533
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:32,050
 I turned the other way.

534
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:34,270
 I crouched.

535
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,560
 I glared.

536
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,320
 But then I met you and loved you.

537
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:50,790
 My body's memories may have changed because I loved.

538
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,030
 Live differently from now on.

539
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:32,640
 I hope you'll live a good life.

540
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,010
 If those memories disappear...

541
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:53,530
 I wonder if I can smile like that again.

542
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:57,270
 If my memory disappears...

543
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:01,490
 what kind of face will I have?

544
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:16,080
Koo Ji Pyo decided to repatriate to the US.

545
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,610
What's going to happen if he goes there?

546
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:22,750
He'll die there probably. I doubt he'll live more than 100 years.

547
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:26,960
- What about Min Woo Cheon? 
 - The higher-ups wish to cover it up. 
 - What?

548
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,330
We can't prove his crimes.

549
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:32,530
The people who requested murder refuse to testify.

550
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:36,900
They're real big shots, you know? They don't want to even reveal the case.

551
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,260
What are they saying? He confessed though.

552
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:42,090
There is no evidence that he committed murder.

553
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:46,030
On top of that, Sin Tae Il was smart enough to make loopholes to get out of trouble.

554
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:49,570
Th-Then what's going to happen?

555
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,710
Are you okay?

556
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:13,040
No. I'm not okay.

557
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,880
It will start to get worse.

558
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,140
Mi Do.

559
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:21,940
But it's okay.

560
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:54,350
Everyone, this is me.

561
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:02,370
Honestly, I can't really remember my childhood.

562
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:07,360
Even the things I can remember,

563
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,410
there are times I get confused if it's real or not.

564
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:13,720
I think I change memories that are too painful...

565
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,760
little by little in my head.

566
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,480
I'm not afraid of nasty comments anymore.

567
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:26,820
It's because I finally learned how to love myself.

568
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:29,120
Do you know what my wish is these days?

569
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:32,480
It's to be able to gulp down water.

570
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:35,250
Isn't it funny?

571
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:37,360
But it's the truth.

572
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:41,590
I'm scared to drink water because it hurts so much.

573
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:44,760
Something that is such a given to you...

574
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,590
may be someone else's earnest wish.

575
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:50,670
Don't forget that.

576
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:07,390
I think today's video may be the last.

577
00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:14,140
I really didn't want to show you the sick side of me.

578
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:21,950
I know some of you felt comforted while watching me.

579
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,750
Thank you.

580
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:31,360
Thank you for following me and not forgetting me.

581
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:41,920
Guys, I, Sung Mi Do, am asking you.

582
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:48,010
You won't forget me, right?

583
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:53,530
You too. Hey, say something.

584
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:56,170
Say anything.

585
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,000
No, thanks.

586
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,650
Unnie?

587
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:33,400
Now I know how it feels.

588
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,450
What do you mean?

589
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:39,690
Death.

590
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:43,530
Death is coming I think.

591
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:49,300
I knew every movie lied about this.

592
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:55,390
Like it would be a panorama passing me by.

593
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:58,320
But I can't see anything.

594
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,070
What are you thinking about?

595
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,490
I want.

596
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:08,620
I want to say something really memorable.

597
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:13,200
But all I can think of are swear words.

598
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:22,580
Donâ€™t think it's funny.

599
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:26,180
Please just pray for me.

600
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:32,850
Good morning.

601
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:14,790
How do I look... right now?

602
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:24,270
Beautiful.

603
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:44,350
 Sis.

604
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,240
 Sis.

605
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:01,430
 Sis.

606
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:14,160
 Mi Yeong

607
00:57:57,770 --> 00:58:03,910

608
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:09,140
 If I lose my memories, I will make new ones.

609
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:14,090
 I will make new memories with you.

610
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:31,340
 The stepfather was found to have abused his stepdaughter, and her life was in danger.

611
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:34,630
Good morning. Did you all eat?

612
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:36,790
Good morning. Hello.

613
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:39,970
Wow, you look so good.

614
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:44,310
Keep your energy up today, too! Good!

615
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:53,170
Excuse me, Mr. Jin Kyu.

616
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:57,540
Weren't you requested as a backup for Team 2?

617
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,890
- I was. 
 - Why are you still here?

618
00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:02,460
- Now? 
 - Of course now. Were you planning on going tomorrow?

619
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:07,770
Didn't you work all night yesterday? I've been waiting for you to get off work.

620
00:59:07,770 --> 00:59:10,530
I'm sorry, but it involves a death.

621
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:13,970
Go home and wait for me there, and I will meet you soon.

622
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:18,150
Ah, why do people keep dying? It's tiring you.

623
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:19,250
Are you okay?

624
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:21,040
- Right? 
 - Yes.

625
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,830
I don't like it.

626
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:28,440
My goodness, you're going to see your mom. I bought it so you can look pretty!

627
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,820
Lies! You didn't buy it.

628
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:32,310
It's pretty though.

629
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:33,780
It's not fashionable!

630
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:37,780
What? What do you know about fashion?

631
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:41,500
I'm going to tell your mom if you don't listen.

632
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:54,500
My mom is getting released soon, right?

633
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:58,460
Yes, of course. Society helped her.

634
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:03,410
People are saying that you're mom had a good reason.

635
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:08,380
I can't believe I received help from society in my lifetime.

636
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:48,050
T-Tofu isn't good.

637
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:50,720
Anyway, I bought you something white.

638
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,570
Eat it.

639
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:05,210
I'm sorry.

640
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:30,440
My goodness, the weather is nice. How can it be this nice?

641
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:34,740
Dress warmly before you go.

642
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:41,670
