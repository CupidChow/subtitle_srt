1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,820
Mom.

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,360
Mom?

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,180
Why? You can't sleep?

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,610
I keep thinking of the ghost I saw on TV yesterday.

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,680
It keeps popping in my mind.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,420
I told you not to watch it.

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,020
What should I do to make me stop thinking of it?

8
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,770
- Who is this? 
 - I don't know.

9
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,750
When I went abroad a long time ago, they were selling pictures at the flea market.

10
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,050
What is this person's name? What kind of life did she live?

11
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,520
Why is she smiling like this?

12
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,180
As I thought about this person's life, my scary thoughts disappeared.

13
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,170
She looks happy.

14
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,000
I'll give this to you.

15
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:08,200
You won't be needing it soon though.

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,780
Why?

17
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,930
As time passes, the things you're scared of disappear.

18
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,230
What if they don't disappear even after time passes?

19
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,560
After a while, you won't be scared of things such as ghosts.

20
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,860
You will be scared of other things.

21
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,110
 Mom was right.

22
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,970
 I'm not scared of such things as ghosts anymore.

23
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,130
 But I'm still scared

24
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:38,140
 of other things. That's why I couldn't sleep at night.

25
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,160
 I'm scared and sad.

26
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,990
 Mom.

27
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,070
 The doctor said that if this is not really a scary and sad event

28
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:13,250
 but I still feel the same way, it means it has become a habit.

29
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,930
 It's not a matter of now

30
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,750
 but a matter of the past.

31
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,500
 I was dwelling there.

32
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,980
 He said that there is a child inside everyone.

33
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:46,880

34
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,270

35
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,380
Give it to me. My wallet.

36
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,520
What?

37
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,750
Give me my wallet.

38
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,900
You came here for that?

39
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,780
But how did you know I was here?

40
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,870
Give me Isobel.

41
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,920
It's the girl in the picture, Isobel.

42
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,070
- Who is that? 
 - I don't know.

43
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,760
What about the picture of a foreigner you don't know?

44
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,160
I don't know her so I'm able to imagine

45
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,320
what kind of life she had or how happy she was.

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,010
Isobel...

47
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:09,450
Isobel probably lived a miserable life and died.

48
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,920
She lived during that time as a girl so she probably was not allowed to do anything at home.

49
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,440
If you look closely, she wasn't even that pretty.

50
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,510
The dog beside her was probably her only friend and must have been the neighborhood punching bag.

51
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,270
It was taken in by everyone hoping to be loved but ended up being kicked out.

52
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,490
What do you know? Who do you think you are?

53
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,590
I'll get your secrets out.

54
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,120
I will go to your grandmother and say that you didn't go on a trip!

55
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,260
I'll tell her that you're dying!

56
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,210
I dare you to say it.

57
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,630
So just give me my wallet.

58
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,910
Oh no.

59
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,810
I think it became a habit.

60
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,460
Excuse me.

61
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:29,070
Are we locking him up or taking him in?

62
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,490
What's all this?

63
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,470
The things that are left behind by those who died.

64
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,660
While Sister Magdalena was cleaning up the dead patients' rooms,

65
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,340
she found messages and notes and she felt bad about just throwing them away.

66
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,950
She said that she collected and kept them here and now it's come to this much.

67
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,760
Because of that, at one point,

68
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,180
people started to write their secrets down and they leave those here.

69
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,420
Things you want to hide or throw away.

70
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,740
Stuff like that.

71
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,830
What should we throw away?

72
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,600
- What? 
 - Where did it all go wrong?

73
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,850
What moment should we throw out to change the present?

74
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,540
The witness has appeared too now.

75
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,630
Is this really the end?

76
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,220
But he came here instead of reporting.

77
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,090
Did he really come all the way here to find the wallet you stole?

78
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,740
- Yes. 
 - Why did you steal it?

79
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,230
In case he reports us, I was going to put the blame on him.

80
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,340
What's with you?

81
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,590
- Then let's do it right. 
 - What?

82
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,010
Let's put his fingerprints all over this golf club.

83
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,960
Unni!

84
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,430
Okay.

85
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,580
What's with her?

86
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,850
Hey. Why did you come here?

87
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,500
What do you want?

88
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,330
About that...

89
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,630
I actually don't know.

90
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,800
What?

91
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,430
It felt like I had to do something.

92
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,900
What?

93
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,800
First, I need to get Isobel back.

94
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,640
Isobel?

95
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,470
What are you talking about?

96
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,560
As for the rest, I need more time to think about it.

97
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,080
I haven't had enough time to think.

98
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,010
I think he's a little dumb.

99
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,040
A lot.

100
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,140
How did he know about this place?

101
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,750
He might have seen it on my social media. He saw my face that day.

102
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,620
Did he really come for his wallet?

103
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,770
Is he not my fan? I think he came to see me.

104
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,690
Something is weird.

105
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,180
Fine. He's a bit weird. It's like he's missing a few screws.

106
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,130
Since there's a witness now, we have to get rid of the evidence.

107
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,920
Evidence.

108
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,950
We killed someone so why are we taking things out like this...

109
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,270
Where should we hide all of these?

110
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,050
Miss Se Yeon!

111
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,150
Your husband is here.

112
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,630
Okay. I'll be out soon.

113
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,700
Let's put everything back in its place.

114
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,380
What are you doing? Hurry up.

115
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,980
Coming!

116
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,520
The weather is nice, isn't it?

117
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,750
Go eat something delicious with your mother, then go to the bank and put your property under my name.

118
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:00,640
I'll take my mother out today.

119
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,260
You've been coming a lot recently. You don't have to go to the company?

120
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,230
I took the day off.

121
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,960
I've never seen you take days off before.

122
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,890
What?

123
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,800
Let's hurry and go.

124
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,340
Okay.

125
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,500
We need to tell Se Yeon the truth.

126
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,400
She thinks she killed him.

127
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,200
Let's solve the problem first.

128
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,050
Did you not see her eyes change when she thought she killed him?

129
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:41,240
She's the type to blab to the police if she didn't think that way.

130
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,650
For now, let's quickly take care of the cellphone.

131
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,330
- How? 
 - Take it back.

132
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:50,020
You can't give it to the victim and can't return it to the original spot.

133
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,180
- Your grandmother's house. 
 - What?

134
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,290
Because that's the most natural place.

135
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,520
San Ah was holding the phone when she fainted

136
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,500
and that guy took San Ah to your grandmother's house.

137
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,970
The cellphone was dropped there.

138
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,530
It must have been hectic, so nobody picked it up.

139
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,820
- What's up with you? 
 - What?

140
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,810
Why are you so proactive?

141
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,520
It'll be over if I just say I killed him.

142
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:21,160
You can just say you tried to stop me or you didn't know.

143
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,930
I'm normally pretty proactive.

144
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:26,630
We're on the same side! Same team.

145
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,910
I like that.

146
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,620
There might be something else if we continue like this.

147
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,860
- What? 
 - I don't know.

148
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,650
After I got told that I was terminally ill, thoughts like "What should I do from now on?" or "What is still left to do?"

149
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,110
All those thoughts seem so bleak.

150
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,280
It's just so structured. I like that.

151
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,690
And I sometimes forget that I'm dying!

152
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,300
I'll go without getting caught.

153
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,740
It's safer than you going to that neighborhood.

154
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:03,810
Keep an eye out on that guy in the meantime, okay?

155
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,790
What?

156
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:39,430
- Se Yeon... 
 - That's been broken for a while.

157
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:57,980
It'll be safer for your husband to do it from now on.

158
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,160
What do I know about managing money?

159
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,030
I'll just forget about it as soon as I turn around.

160
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,360
What about the house?

161
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,420
I left...

162
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,230
Did you take the security deposit and give it to my husband?

163
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,210
Yeah...

164
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,930
- Mom! 
 - What?

165
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,070
I won't be around for long.

166
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,210
What are you saying?

167
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,710
If I'm not around, you're alone.

168
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,790
Don't say stuff like that.

169
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:30,460
You have to accept it. I'm dying!

170
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,520
No...

171
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,850
- If you get better from treatment— 
 - Mom!

172
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:42,790
You must fend for yourself from now on. You can't rely on others anymore.

173
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,220
Oh Young Chan is not going to take care of you. You can't rely on him.

174
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,710
I said not to say stuff like that!

175
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,650
You don't need to stay at his house!

176
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,210
Hello...

177
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:08,500
 It's the CCTV footage where the victim of the Yongil neighborhood random murder case is shown.

178
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,660
That day at three in the afternoon, Mr. Kang had a knife in hand

179
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,810
and approached two elementary students going to school.

180
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:19,080
How can they call it a random crime? It should be a targeted crime!

181
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,970
He obviously was only after elementary students.

182
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:24,980
He definitely asked himself a lot of times which ones are the easiest to kill.

183
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,800
That's correct.

184
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,450
Oh, it's In Sook.

185
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,490
Hi!

186
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,530
Is it not hard?

187
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,300
What's going on?

188
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:14,100
Well... naturally...

189
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,430
You untied yourself?

190
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,290
How?

191
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,690
Um... just did it?

192
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,570
The door was locked though...

193
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,950
There was more than one exit.

194
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,840
 What's here?

195
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,940
 How curious...

196
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,140
There was someone who kept snooping at the door.

197
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,830
 W-What is it?

198
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,520
 Hello. Where is the director's office?

199
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,340
 - Have you done volunteering before? 
 - Yes.

200
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,850
 What kind?

201
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,240
 At the abandoned dogs shelter.

202
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,950
 Oh, is that right?

203
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,450
 Min Woo Cheon, your patient

204
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,120
 has Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis(ALS) or Lou Gehrig's Disease.

205
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,760
 She is a special case, but

206
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,890
 she needs to be moved even when she's sleeping to stay alive.

207
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,740
 The volunteers take turns doing it.

208
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,680
 We are still short on hands. Especially at night.

209
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,270
 Coincidentally, I have insomnia.

210
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:37,380
 Oh my! Perfect!

211
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,980
 I'll do my best.

212
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,330
She hired you without checking your identity?

213
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:46,540
Everybody who works here was previously convicted.

214
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,140
They're doing community service after committing a crime.

215
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,260
Okay, I understand.

216
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,860
I understand, so you go now.

217
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,900
You only did it to get out of the situation back then so now, just go.

218
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,810
What about my wallet?

219
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,030
Oh, the evidence?

220
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,270
What?

221
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:12,790
The evidence of you killing that man?

222
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,190
- What? 
 - Just like you said, there are no security cameras there.

223
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:22,980
There's no evidence and, obviously, the dead can't talk.

224
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,830
So the truth is up to me.

225
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:35,950
If you say something, I will too.

226
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,700
Witnessing a murder scene on the way home

227
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:44,310
and this is a wallet that the murderer dropped.

228
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,470
Something's strange.

229
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,200
Isn't the probability of you killing him

230
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,310
higher than the probability of me killing him?

231
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:59,130
- Why? 
 - You've never been seen in that neighborhood.

232
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,110
- How would you know? 
 - Why were you there?

233
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:04,070
- I was passing by. 
 - You were passing by and coincidentally saw San Ah standing there?

234
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,210
- Yeah. 
 - Okay fine, let's say that happened.

235
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:10,330
Then you saw a murder scene but

236
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:15,820
you didn't report it and came all the way to look for a wallet without any money in it?

237
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,120
But...

238
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,430
I... you...

239
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,260
You...

240
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:43,170
What about me? Why?

241
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:49,220
By the way, are you really terminally ill?

242
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,120
Did you want to ask so obviously?

243
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,030
It's weird though...

244
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:59,220
You're about to die but you're planning to put the blame on me who's still alive?

245
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:09,240
I want to give life a try before I die.

246
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,580
Everybody lives like that.

247
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,700
 The key is under a flower pot in front of the entryway.

248
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,230
 There are all kinds of junk piled up in the house.

249
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,830
 You can just hide it in the pile of broken electronics.

250
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,870
Who are you?

251
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,720
Ah! You scared me.

252
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,150
Hello, I'm In Sook's friend.

253
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,500
She asked me to check if her grandma is doing well.

254
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,560
In Sook does not have friends.

255
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,180
Who doesn't have friends?

256
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,140
Sister In Sook.

257
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,610
She can make friends. She made friends!

258
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:40,450
Me. I'm In Sook's friend.

259
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,910
How did you get in here?

260
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:48,630
Well... Since we're friends, she told me where to find the key.

261
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,940
Anyway... I see her grandma isn't home.

262
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,790
I wanted to see and greet her. Is she doing well?

263
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:02,080
But... do you know me?

264
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,610
- What? 
 - How come you're not asking who I am?

265
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,800
I don't even live in this house.

266
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,750
That's right! Why are you here?

267
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,710
I come here when my mom works.

268
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,840
Oh yeah, I heard about you.

269
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,530
That you come over to play sometimes...

270
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,460
She talked about me?

271
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,930
Yeah... of course...

272
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,950
Where is sister?

273
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:26,770
Where is she?

274
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,250
What? Well...

275
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:32,750
Why does it feel like I'm being interrogated?

276
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,400
But I'm just asking you.

277
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,400
If you feel that way, did you do something wrong?

278
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,820
Look at this kid...

279
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,060
 Can you see me today?

280
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,940
Hey, I'm going to go first!

281
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,500
Oh! Have you seen the new volunteer?

282
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,420
W-Why?

283
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,300
He's handsome.

284
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,250
What?

285
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,430
If he's cleaned– I mean, if he showers, he could be quite attractive.

286
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,600
Have you still not figured it out?

287
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,560
I ran the facial recognition program on the security cameras at the redevelopment site.

288
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,120
There's nothing that comes up from that neighborhood.

289
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,330
There were so many security cameras but nothing was caught. Where did he go?

290
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,090
We'll zoom into the faces more and try again.

291
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,860
Okay, I understand.

292
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,800

293
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,760
- What is it? 
 - The student who died from a scuffle with Min Woo Cheon in middle school,

294
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,470
Joo Eun Hyuk, it's his mother.

295
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,980
- And? 
 - Min Woo Cheon is the suspect...

296
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,850
The pattern of the murder is quite hard to understand.

297
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:15,030
If the motive is vague, the character tells us something.

298
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,000
I have no interest in his character though.

299
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,980
This is an order. Go.

300
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,160
I followed him for 10 years.

301
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,540
I had to ruin that child, Min Woo Cheon.

302
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:46,910
That boy killed my child.

303
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,550
They said it was an accident.

304
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:51,240
My one and only son died

305
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,390
but they said it was an accident.

306
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:59,080
What can I do when my child died.

307
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,590
That boy has to live after coming out from juvenile detention, but I couldn't let that happen.

308
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:08,960
He was good at studying and had a great mind.

309
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,040
He was going to get a license and find work

310
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,720
and was going to earn a living.

311
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,320
I prevented all of that.

312
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,570
Completely. I blocked all of the holes he could breathe through.

313
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:25,250
I lived doing that.

314
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,960
Do you understand?

315
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,180
Yes.

316
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:36,260
Blaming and hating another person... that's how you simplify the problem.

317
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,420
That's why humans always make enemies.

318
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:46,210
On top of that, the boy's mom got sick.

319
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:49,560
But can she get treated if she has no money?

320
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:55,190
She found a hospital but I used my money to get her kicked out.

321
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,360
She probably died at home.

322
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:04,020
While imagining that child watching his mother die, I pulled through even more.

323
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:08,800
But I don't know what happened after that.

324
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,730
He disappeared from the world.

325
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,880
If he hid so perfectly,

326
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:19,330
maybe it's the realm of darkness.

327
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,550
It must have been cold.

328
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,050
It was very cold.

329
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,000
Is it still cold?

330
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,630
No! A little?

331
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:38,900
Wait...

332
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,140
 The ovarian cancer patient, Sister Shaman, whether that be true or not,

333
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,410
 is the biggest interest of the hospice.

334
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,950
Pinky is here... Pink...

335
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,250
 His life... was cold?

336
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,730
Where are you going? Come here!

337
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,740
Why is she here again?

338
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:02,370
She's disrupting my focus. Should I take a look at you, too?

339
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,220
No.

340
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,490
Should we keep going? Come here.

341
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,950
You were cold.

342
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,600
I think I must go now...

343
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,630
N-No! I'll make it warm...

344
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:22,410

345
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:26,680
Woo Cheon, eat this.

346
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,820
No, I'm okay.

347
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,430
You can just drink it with hot water.

348
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:35,630
Now that I see it, your hands are cold these days. Cold!

349
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:39,090
This is good stuff.

350
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,550
Don't give it to other people.

351
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,670
I'm really fine...

352
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:47,480
No!

353
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,580
What is that? Huh?

354
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,080
Lemon preserves.

355
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,790
It's not just lemon preserves. There must be something else in it.

356
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:59,220
She seemed healthier recently. Maybe because of that?

357
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,670
- I'm okay. 
 - No, just try it once.

358
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:04,150
We should also get the same thing as that woman.

359
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,830
It's really all right...

360
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,180
Hurry and take it, take it before someone sees.

361
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,080
You must eat it by yourself. Understand?

362
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,710
- Thank you. 
 - Okay.

363
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,190
Go now.

364
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:18,150
Eat it all! Hurry.

365
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,500
 The hope of the hospice.

366
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:26,440
 She's been living for 2 years since being diagnosed with liver cancer.

367
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:35,950
She is doing that again. Piling up food like a mountain and wasting it.

368
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,010
Her appetite is something else.

369
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:42,680
It's not just her appetite. She asked for double her prescription of drugs.

370
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,500
I shouldn't age like that...

371
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,580
Sung Hae, don't be like that...

372
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,570
Don't be like that...

373
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,800
Eat a lot.

374
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,730
 Her nickname is "nuisance," and her name is Oh Cheon Deok. 
 (TN: nuisance- cheondeok kkureogi)

375
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,760
 Final stage of colon cancer.

376
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:24,770
 Even that grandma, who is quite greedy and eats more than everyone else, likes him.

377
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:37,240
Apples are quite... strange.

378
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,450
What is strange?

379
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,740
Adam and Eve who ate an apple.

380
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,530
You could say that that event was the start of religion,

381
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:50,230
and the start of human history.

382
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:54,380
Before then, Adam and Eve, who weren't gods or humans,

383
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,760
in that kind of state,

384
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,600
were just immature kids running around playing in Eden.

385
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,430
Then a snake deceived Eve

386
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:09,690
and Eve deceived Adam.

387
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:24,320
 Why must one only love one person? Isn't that discrimination?

388
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,540
 While having such thoughts, she dated a number of men at once

389
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:30,600
 then she became a nun. Even that Veronica...

390
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,100
- Is he handsome? 
 - No

391
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,950
- He has an aura about him though. 
 - What aura?

392
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:46,280
He's got a face that stimulates curiosity.

393
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,970
- Then, what about us? 
 - We are flat.

394
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:52,440
What are you talking about, where can such beautiful faces like ours be found?

395
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,090
- He's got an energy that I hate instinctually. 
 - I hate that energy, too!

396
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:59,100
Are we the only ones who hate him?

397
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:03,170
No, I don't think so

398
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:10,670
 The men who were ex-convicts hated him.

399
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,990
 Ooh, he is so cool.

400
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:18,730
 Wow, that was cool

401
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:23,170
 He is handsome.

402
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,690
- How long have you been out here? 
 - Huh?

403
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,890
- Just now. 
 - Great timing.

404
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:44,520
Why are you here all of a sudden?

405
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,040
You've never contacted me personally before.

406
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,930
We only see each other from time to time while meeting Ho Seon.

407
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,840
You like me.

408
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,110
- What? 
 - Am I wrong?

409
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:00,710
You're not, but how did you know?

410
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,500
There aren't many women who don't like me

411
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,840
- Get in for now. 
 - You're ridiculous.

412
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,530
But you don't like women.

413
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:20,770
I don't like them much. I find dating to be cumbersome and uncomfortable.

414
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:24,210
So, are you feeling sympathy for me because I'm dying?

415
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,980
Yeah.

416
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:29,370
I'm just a bit intrigued.

417
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,520
Are you offended?

418
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,200
Not really.

419
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,530
I'm just flustered that you said it so straightforward.

420
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,770
- What are you going to do if I don't die? 
 - That would be better.

421
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:46,010
But... where are we going?

422
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,940
What?

423
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:05,400
It's like a documentary; I do interviews sometimes, too.

424
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,890
You can ask me something.

425
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,710
- Do you have anyone you like? 
 - No.

426
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,780
Then you wouldn't know.

427
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,090
Know what?

428
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:22,340
Under what circumstances do you fall in love at first sight?

429
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:25,910
- Why are you sighing? 
 - Why are you asking a kid about that?

430
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:28,270
The feeling just comes.

431
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:32,850
- What feeling? 
 - Well, like you need to pee.

432
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,660
What kind of scene did you see her in?

433
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:40,940
It's just a bit of a strange scene to discuss with a minor.

434
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,270
- Was she naked? 
 - No, no...

435
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:46,630
No, it wasn't like that.

436
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:51,060
Well, she did take something off...

437
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:56,840
While holding something... and after doing something... to somebody.

438
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,840
And then she took her hood off...

439
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,800
and the rain was falling so hard...

440
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:15,560
I'm not sure...

441
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,550
but I keep thinking about that scene.

442
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:24,320
I think about why I keep thinking about it.

443
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:31,800
But whenever I think of that scene, I feel a softness in my chest...

444
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,240
But like I said, it wasn't the kind of scene that should make me feel like that.

445
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,470
But I keep feeling a bit of a tingle inside...

446
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:46,160
 Does he... like me?

447
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,930
But if you're an insomniac, does that mean that you don't sleep at night?

448
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:54,230
Originally, if I couldn't sleep, I would look at Isobel,

449
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,110
but she's gone now.

450
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,900
Isobel?

451
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:02,240
Why can't you sleep at night?

452
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,320
Sleeping is scary.

453
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,950
Why? Did you have nightmares?

454
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:14,470
I was sleeping when my mom died.

455
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:25,240
That night, my mom was in a lot of pain.

456
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,720
So I knew she wouldn't make it through the night.

457
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:34,150
I knew that. I knew,

458
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:39,410
so I was sad and afraid... but...

459
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:42,000
I fell asleep.

460
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,270
My mom went while I was sleeping.

461
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:51,200
She went alone. It must have been lonely.

462
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,670
 He's a blooming idiot.

463
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,210
Mom.

464
00:37:56,210 --> 00:38:00,100
You scared me! You're drunk again.

465
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,340
Do you know what time it is?

466
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:05,010
Did In Sook call you?

467
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:09,700
She must be having a great time over there.

468
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:15,530
She went there?

469
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:18,730
Yes. A neighborhood full of water.

470
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,490
It's fascinating, isn't it?

471
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,680
- Mom. 
 - Don't look at me like that.

472
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,900
It's unsettling when you look at me like that.

473
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,440
What about food? After drinking, you should at least eat something so that you don't spoil your insides.

474
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,330
Mom!

475
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,150
Since I was young, I really hated being hugged by my mom.

476
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:46,690
- Nonsense. 
 - However, this is what people said.

477
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:50,100
They said that I grew up with a lot of love.

478
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,930
That it shows.

479
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:55,970
People who receive a lot of love are strong,

480
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:59,510
confident, and regardless of what others say,

481
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:03,040
"Yeah, well, what about me?" they don't mind it.

482
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,790
You were quite pretty when you were younger.

483
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:10,700
Every time I took you out, people would stare.

484
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,770
Who would have thought you would live so dirtily?

485
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,970
That's what's driving me crazy!

486
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:21,350
Even if you have such a dirty face, when I look at you,

487
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:24,140
I remember your appearance from back then.

488
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,520
Your best image overlaps with it.

489
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,430
That's why I can't throw you away even though I want to.

490
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:35,840
I couldn't give that to In Sook.

491
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,620
I couldn't give her love.

492
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,870
But you loved her a lot.

493
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:48,500
Of course, I gave her more love than you did.

494
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:52,840
But do you think it will ever come close to a parent's embrace?

495
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:59,350
- Mom. 
 - Why do you keep calling me? It's disgusting.

496
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:03,970
What if I got sick

497
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:08,480
and I would die, what would you do?

498
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,060
What would you want to do? What would you want to do for me?

499
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,570
Do you need money again?

500
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:18,000
Do you want to sell my life and take it all?

501
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:23,060
I gave... her money.

502
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,410
I gave her money,

503
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:32,170
but... I don't know exactly what I should do for her.

504
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:36,690
Why don't I ever know what to do?

505
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:42,070
Unlike others, who know what to do and when to do it,

506
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:45,720
I don't know things like that.

507
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,400
So I just turned my head.

508
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,010
I just drink and try to forget.

509
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:55,060
It's not something that I can forget,

510
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:59,790
but if an issue that's too big comes by...

511
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,880
So...

512
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:08,020
Why are you talking nonsense so late at night?

513
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,750
- Mom, what should I do? 
 - What do you mean?

514
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:17,660
Hurry, and go to your house. You stink.

515
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:31,420
Where are you? Do you know what time it is?

516
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:39,090
Oh, right!  Today is your mom's birthday.

517
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:42,710
Have a nice time and...

518
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:46,800
Never mind, I'll tell you tomorrow.

519
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:56,990
Look at the laundry.

520
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:00,740
It looks upsetting.

521
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,250
Why? Why is this here?

522
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:14,310
I couldn't find it no matter how much I looked. That's weird.

523
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:18,160
It's so expensive here!

524
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,620
What's this?

525
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,350
I don't need to go into a bed.

526
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:32,230
- What? 
 - I thought he would've come since it's your birthday.

527
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:34,160
Jeez.

528
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,740
Even I didn't remember my birthday. I'm sure he's busy.

529
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,490
Huh? Anyway, this is nice.

530
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:44,140
I get to do things that don't suit me.

531
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:47,560
What suited me?

532
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,460
I'm just wondering what suited me.

533
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:53,020
Everything suits you.

534
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:57,710
Mom.

535
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,730
What kind of kid was I?

536
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:03,140
You studied well.

537
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:10,060
Your personality wasn't bad so you were nice to your friends and parents.

538
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,920
You were that kind of kid.

539
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,400
You were like that but...

540
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,680
Was I really like that?

541
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:35,340
By doing what other people like and tell, and being a little unlucky and I have come this far.

542
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,260
I'm not sure of who I am.

543
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:45,460
Who am I? What is inside me?

544
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:56,100
What is it? Is something wrong?

545
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,480
Why did he come searching for me without reporting anything?

546
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,760
Is it really because of the wallet?

547
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,210
 What kind of a scene did you see that person in?

548
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:09,820
 She just took off her hood,

549
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:15,340
 and it was raining. My heart was pounding...

550
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:20,010
Did he fall for me, while I killed someone?

551
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:21,840
 He's weird.

552
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:38,480
 We need to get rid of the variables. You took care of the phone, right?

553
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:19,080
Are you okay?

554
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,560
I'm fine.

555
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,200
Don't you remember me?

556
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:07,130
 The person you're trying to reach is...

557
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,700

558
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:37,930
- Why are you calling this late? 
 - What do you mean, why?

559
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:42,680
I just wanted to call. Must there be a why between us?

560
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:48,390
- What is our relationship? 
 - Bullshit. Hey, you...

561
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:51,680
- You're in Singapore, right? 
  - Yes.

562
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,590
- Right. 
  - Yes.

563
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:57,220
- Is it nice? 
 - Of course.

564
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:00,820
 - When are you coming back?  
 - I'm not sure.

565
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:04,960
- What are you saying? 
 - I lost my way.

566
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,270
-  What?  
 - I am always far behind, right.

567
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:11,820
I am always one step late.

568
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:15,790
- I think I am farther behind now. 
 - So what?

569
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:18,600
So what if you lost your way in someplace?

570
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:22,450
Traveling means you take a path you're unfamiliar with.

571
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:29,130
After losing my way, if I continue on the path,

572
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:31,600
I might see another path.

573
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:34,820
If I keep going like that...

574
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,500
it will end at some point.

575
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:05,330
Oppa. Oppa?

576
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:23,630
Se Yeon.

577
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:28,590
Se Yeon?

578
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,760
 Mom,

579
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,630
 stay here for a while. I booked it for a month.

580
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:37,900
 Just wait a bit.

581
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:45,600
Look at this.

582
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:52,560
- What do we do? 
 - There is a person in there.

583
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,760
Geez. There's a fire. Fire. There's a fire.

584
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,650
Why is there a fire?

585
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:22,560
Se Yeon and Mi Do went out. Pyo In Sook.

586
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,910
Ms. Pyo In Sook.

587
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:26,330
What about Mr. Min Woo Cheon?

588
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:28,650
Did you not see them, grandmother?

589
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:30,920
Why are you asking me that?

590
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:10,990
What are you doing? Why are you here

591
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,890
- It's a misunderstanding. 
 - Why are you here?

592
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:15,130
- Wait, wait. 
 - Are you doing this because of the wallet?

593
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:17,860
- That's not it. 
 - Do you actually like me?

594
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:19,390
Let's leave first.

595
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:21,290
What are you doing here?

596
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:24,190
Why are you here?

597
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:27,430
Do you want to die?

598
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:34,760
Let go! Let go of me, I said!

599
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,500
Are you crazy?

600
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:41,920
Let go! Let go of me! Are you crazy?

601
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,600
What's going on?

602
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,960
Isn't that the fire alarm going off?

603
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,270
- Where's In Sook? 
 - The thing is

604
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:52,030
- she's probably in there. 
 - What?

605
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,650
- Let go! 
 - They're coming out.

606
00:52:57,650 --> 00:53:01,890
- What are you doing? 
 - Wow!

607
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:06,200
- Wow! 
 - Aigoo! Aigoo!

608
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:41,020
All right. I have caught him on CCTV.

609
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:44,760
- Where? 
 - Loa Animal Hospital. Loa.

610
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:48,870
My shoulder...

611
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:57,750
- Did you drink? 
 - A little.

612
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,190
Don't leak any information!

613
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:03,430
Taking drinks from the men in the neighborhood,

614
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:09,220
then leaking information to them while saying, "It's tasty." That's all in the past, right?

615
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:11,060
You fixed it, right?

616
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:13,580
What are we going to do with him?

617
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:16,020
So, you're saying that he's this dog's guardian?

618
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:20,610
Yes. But... has that person done something wrong?

619
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:23,120
No, I just have something to ask.

620
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,950
Does he ever call here?

621
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:27,780
Sometimes, when he cannot come, he does call us.

622
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:29,320
Then, may I give you my contact information?

623
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:33,710
Don't say anything, just contact me if he calls.

624
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:42,810

625
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:46,000
But it's very strange, isn't it?

626
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,150
The fire alarm was ringing so loud, what were they doing in that room to not come out?

627
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:53,180
Later, carrying one of them...

628
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,220
That's it!

629
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:59,260
They did that during the fire?

630
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:03,790
They're in their youth. You can't see or hear anything when you're young.

631
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:06,730
Is it to the point where you can't hear anything...

632
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:09,680
My goodness.

633
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,150
It's been so long that I don't remember.

634
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,130
Me neither.

635
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:20,010
Then, how was it?

636
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:23,590
It's not like that.

637
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:29,820
It seems like that, it seems like that.

638
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:32,190
- It's not, really... 
 - His face is getting red.

639
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:35,270
It's all right.

640
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:38,790
Volunteer?

641
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,000
As expected, it was because of me.

642
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,400
He went through a lot to try and see me. He's almost a stalker.

643
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,150
But... was he really just passing by?

644
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:52,630
It is pretty strange, he even knew all of the CCTV locations.

645
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:55,960
You said that the guy who died had a lot of problems.

646
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:00,650
He was taken in for domestic violence, he gambled, and had a lot of debt.

647
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:03,520
Did he do something to incur a grudge?

648
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,170
He's not the police, right?

649
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:12,260
Sis! What kind of police officer witnesses a murder and just leaves?

650
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:16,600
On top of that, just by looking, you can tell that he's lacking.

651
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,890
He's a nobody.

652
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:21,490
I think he might be a bit of an idiot?

653
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:24,700
And I know kids like that quite well.

654
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,140
Kids that are beggars by default.

655
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:32,360
Spinning around in my surroundings, working out how to get a few pennies from me.

656
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,590
Should I just give it to him? A few pennies?

657
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:38,750
Kids like that? By default?

658
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:42,760
You see that?

659
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,550
- What? 
 - Can you see what kind of person he is?

660
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:47,360
Do you see it?

661
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:51,150
What? You're taking his side?

662
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:53,320
Are you already into him?

663
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:57,190
Well, since you've never dated a man before, you spin at small things,

664
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:00,130
and find meaning in insignificant things, but—

665
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:02,000
A load of crap.

666
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,720
- What did you say? 
 - Who gave you the right?

667
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:09,490
When you don't even look at someone properly, without even intending to look at them, why do you judge them like it's nothing?

668
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:12,640
Do you think you're way above everyone else?

669
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,580
Yes. More than you, for sure.

670
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:17,420
Weren't you just a stain all the way up there?

671
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:23,290
What? Stain? Hey, even if I'm a stain,

672
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:25,690
your home is barely trash.

673
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:27,860
Can you breathe in a place like that?

674
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:31,700
- Looks like you think we are on the same level, just because I let you along. 
 - Looks like you have fun by killing people.

675
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,530
I wasn't the one that killed him!

676
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:37,760
Okay, so that's what you wanted to say?

677
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:45,370
I thought that we were on the same side, but I must have been mistaken.

678
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:49,450
- I should step out. 
 - Stop, you guys.

679
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:53,790
If you guys are like this, what about me? I'm the one who did it...

680
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:55,690
Sis, it wasn't you.

681
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:01,630
Say it yourself, since I'll try to handle this on my own now.

682
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:11,670
It's hard to notice that, how did you get to know?

683
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:18,030
Then... she can't hear because of the brain tumor?

684
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:20,770
It's not because of that.

685
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:25,820
Well, when one's physical condition is unwell, their senses can be influenced.

686
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:30,170
It appears that Pyo In Sook already had a hearing impediment.

687
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,010
What are you saying?

688
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:48,570
In anger, she is just saying that and wants to take responsibility for the killing.

689
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:53,790
She's really weird. Then, is she planning on falling in love? In this situation?

690
00:58:55,930 --> 00:59:00,060
Miss Se Yeon? You're needed in the medical treatment room.

691
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:10,870
When did the sleepwalking begin?

692
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:15,770
It's hard to say... about a month or two ago?

693
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:20,060
It's been about three months since you started taking Zolpidem, too.

694
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:22,760
But... why do I do that all of a sudden?

695
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,720
Your stress levels are at a maximum.

696
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,780
Being told you were terminally ill probably added a lot to your stress levels.

697
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:34,860
When someone is in a sleepwalking state,

698
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:36,190
could their personality change?

699
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:41,250
Rather than a change in personality, one's control can weaken overall.

700
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:46,090
Repressed anger, that was not expressed, could also explode.

701
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:48,730
Repressed anger?

702
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,130
But... it disappeared.

703
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:55,760
I've been all right for the past few days.

704
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,290
In Sook and Mi Do have been watching over me.

705
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:02,600
In the case of sleepwalking, there's no specific way to treat it.

706
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,810
It can take place or be suspended at any time.

707
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:08,350
But when did it disappear?

708
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:10,790
Did something special happen?

709
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:31,520
Brunch?

710
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,920
You can stomach brunch? Asshole.

711
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:43,490
Geez.

712
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:45,700
Should I have killed him?

713
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:52,690
Should I pretend that I killed him?

714
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,260
No, that is—

715
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:57,020
We didn't do it to put the blame on you.

716
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:00,330
You got scared and said you were going to turn us in.

717
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:03,470
Would things clear up if I confess that I killed him?

718
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:06,650
No, that's not it...

719
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:09,590
- It's true that you were the one that suggested it first. 
 - What?

720
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:12,130
If you didn't say that...

721
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:16,600
- Say what? 
 - If you're dying, you should take one bad guy with you. You said that first.

722
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:21,270
In Sook went out after hearing that. Don't you remember?

723
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:23,620
Where is In Sook now?

724
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:56,060
- What are you smiling about? 
 - Isn't her smile pretty?

725
01:01:56,060 --> 01:02:01,830
The person that took the picture must have liked you, it came out pretty.

726
01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:05,830
They say that you can see the feelings of the photographer in the photo.

727
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,900
By now,

728
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:12,320
you would have left this world.

729
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:15,930
That's probably true.

730
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:17,660
I, too,

731
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:22,660
will disappear from this world soon.

732
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:34,060
There probably aren't any pictures of me smiling.

733
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:37,760
I'll take them for you. Prettily.

734
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:41,130
But I won't look forward to anything.

735
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:45,130
I know very well.

736
01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:04,070
 Grandma, I wanted to see the sea.

737
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:07,240
 But it rains all year round in Singapore,

738
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:11,960
 and all of the seawater is poop water. Like my life.

739
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:21,460
 When you expect something and want it...

740
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:23,830
 most of the time it's poop water.

741
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:38,160
 So...

742
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:42,660
 I know. I won't look forward to anything.

743
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,990
I know

744
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:52,130
what that is like. Not being able to keep up with others.

745
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:03,860
Min Woo Cheon. He is currently the strongest suspect.

746
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:06,560
He doesn't have a cell phone or a credit card.

747
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:11,360
The fact that his trail is so difficult to trace is strange on its own.

748
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:16,000
Min Woo Cheon! Min Woo Cheon! Do you know that case from when Min Woo Cheon was younger?

749
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,490
They were saying that it happened when some kids were just having a disagreement,

750
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:21,330
but the doctor's note said otherwise. Take a look.

751
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:25,440
He could have never ended up like that unless he was struck with a weapon.

752
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,160
- You said it was a simple accident. 
 - But that's not the case. That's not it.

753
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:35,260
I think he got involved with some bad guys after he got out of the juvenile detention center. He did all sorts of dirty errands like drug deliveries to earn money.

754
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:39,640
According to the guys there, he was quite smart and knew how to fight well.

755
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:42,800
And then after his mom died, blank.

756
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:51,300

757
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:58,470
We tracked him down to a hospice center from the call he made to the animal hospital.

758
01:05:14,930 --> 01:05:19,070
All right, listen up. Block all entrances and don't let even a rat get away.

759
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:23,750
Also, in the worst-case scenario, you can shoot... stand by.

760
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:27,980
- Are you filming a movie? 
 - Don't shoot until you get orders, all right?

761
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:30,140
 - Yes, sir!  
 - To your places.

762
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:35,300
- To your places! You're going to go in by yourself? 
 - Yes.

763
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:42,900
What are you doing? I said take it.

764
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:45,710
Why? All of a sudden?

765
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:49,440
I forgot that I was dying for a bit.

766
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:54,370
You seem to have found interest in tormenting me after coming here.

767
01:05:54,370 --> 01:05:56,390
It's not fun for me.

768
01:05:57,470 --> 01:06:03,340
One thing, leave the other two people because I was the one who killed.

769
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:05,570
Why did you do it?

770
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:10,800
Because I'm dying anyway. I wanted to take someone out with me.

771
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:17,090
I wanted to protect that child before I went.

772
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:27,020
So take this and go away.

773
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:30,970
- What are you talking about, all of a sudden? 
 - I'm turning myself in.

774
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:32,670
I killed–

775
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,190
 If I kiss...

776
01:07:19,390 --> 01:07:21,040
 sleep will come.

777
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:34,710

778
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:41,200

779
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,750
 I killed someone.

780
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:46,080
 And I am dying. I am about to die but I am reminded of him.

781
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:47,380
 The person you kissed at the hospice center,

782
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:48,230
 what's your relationship with her?

783
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:52,380
 I slept with a man yesterday, and he disappeared like nothing happened.

784
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:55,050
 I know that my mom is going to die,

785
01:07:55,050 --> 01:07:57,360
 it would have been nice for her to have been able to smile one more time.

786
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:00,220
 We found something while investigating the victim's house.

787
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:02,650
 Why is everyone looking for the mobile phone?

788
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:04,490
 If our tail's been caught, we need to cut it off.

789
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:09,060
 - Does that mean I killed another person again? 
 - Don't mess with that woman. If you do...

790
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:10,710
 I might explode.

791
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:16,290
♫  All the moments we drew together can never be erased  ♫

792
01:08:16,290 --> 01:08:18,780
