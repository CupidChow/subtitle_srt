1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,550
 The world is overflowing with anger.

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,490
 Because the world is irrational.

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,450
 Because the law is unjust.

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,090
 Anger for justice?

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,800
 Nevertheless, I don't believe in anger.

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,310
28 year old Bang Joon Seo. This person brutally assaulted and killed his girlfriend, and rose to the top spot on the murder list.

7
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,310
He wasn't expected to run away, so his arrest warrant was dismissed,

8
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:38,580
and he was found dead on the rooftop of a building near his house.

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,490
This is the third murder.

10
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,460
There can't be anymore. Announce an open search.

11
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,360
Since it's gotten this way anyway, put one out for Min Woo Cheon, too.

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,890
A serial killer and a hitman.

13
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,960
 If anger can't find an exit and overflows,

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,790
 no one knows which direction it will go.

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,450
 Anger easily changes direction.

16
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:08,060
 And it rushes on.

17
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,730

18
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,640
Over there!

19
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,920
 After that, it rages like a wave with uncontrollable speed

20
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,850
 and swallows the truth.

21
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,180
 Like that, it strikes everything

22
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,250
 and becomes an infection.

23
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,350

24
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,820

25
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,410
Things are a mess right now! You're looking at the hate comments again, aren't you?

26
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,040
No, I'm not.

27
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,230
Would people know that your hobby is reading hate comments?

28
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,290
- Do you know why I'm reading hate comments? 
 - Vicarious satisfaction?

29
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:56,820
I'm trying to understand the anger.

30
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,260
Criticism and curses spewed recklessly are nothing but excrement.

31
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,370
Anger like that can't face justice.

32
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:10,540
When it comes to the emotion of anger, refined language and attitudes are needed.

33
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:14,660
Isn't it necessary to understand anger in order to properly soothe it?

34
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,960
Yes. To begin with, I think that we may need to soothe this anger first.

35
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,830
There are more than a few patients who are saying that they will leave the hospice, too!

36
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,020
H-H-How many?

37
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,900
What are you going to do? You've seen the articles about the third murder, haven't you?

38
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,660
People are going crazy saying that Min Woo Cheon and Pyo In Sook killed him while on the run.

39
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,030
That won't be true.

40
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,660
I don't know anymore! I can't be sure that it isn't true.

41
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,150
- They are in love. 
 - Pardon?

42
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,840
What kind of lovers would commit murder?

43
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:54,030

44
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,760
Do you think that she will come when you're sitting in this narrow alleyway so obviously?

45
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,430
Will she come? Will she be able to come?

46
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,460
If she has nowhere to go, she has to come here for me to give her food.

47
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,940
Would she come when you guys are sitting here like this?

48
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,220
She's alive, isn't she?

49
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,800
She hasn't died somewhere, right?

50
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,560
Nothing has been confirmed yet.

51
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,560
Yet?

52
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,660
Keep that in mind. She ran away because you guys are barking up the wrong tree!

53
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,720
You couldn't catch the real killer from the beginning,

54
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,130
you're torturing that innocent kid,

55
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,040
ruining a kid that's dying...

56
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,470
My In Sook said that she didn't kill them...

57
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,910
Isn't catching criminals your job?

58
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:20,490
You shouldn't be sitting here, go catch the real culprit!

59
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,380
Grandma!

60
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,650
Grandma!

61
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,690
Please get up.

62
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,250
Forget it. I'm fine.

63
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,580
Since I'm all right, give me San Ah and go to work.

64
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,980
No.

65
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:42,350
Go. Even if the world turns upside down, you need to work in order to eat.

66
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,190
Come with me.

67
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:49,250
Come with me to the hospice. I have to make lunch.

68
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,750
Announcing an open search for Min Woo Cheon was going too far.

69
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,220
The public's attention and anxiety are on the verge of madness.

70
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,000
All of this only happened because you guys couldn't catch them!

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,470
That's why we couldn't stop the third murder!

72
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,100
It is not a serial murder.

73
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,680
He was at the top of the murder list, and the moss rose was in his hair,

74
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,340
but why wasn't it a serial murder?

75
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,990
The evidence is lacking.

76
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,020
Pyo In Sook couldn't explain how she killed Park Du Jin,

77
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,690
and there are a lot of suspicious aspects of the third murder's crime scene.

78
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,600
Bring the evidence!

79
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,350
Don't keep talking about there being no evidence, and bring some evidence!

80
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,760
A witness has appeared.

81
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,930
- Where? 
 - Gosan Station.

82
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,000
Are you okay?

83
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,170
Wait a moment.

84
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,210
- It's all over. 
 - We just need to go a little further.

85
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,940
- Why that picture? 
 - What?

86
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,160
That's my least favorite picture.

87
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,770
When that picture was taken, I said that I didn't want to,

88
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:11,180
but my grandma dressed me in that red outfit.

89
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,570
But the background was red.

90
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,780
So everything but my face was red.

91
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,680
Like my neck was floating alone.

92
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,640
But since that picture is coming out and being labeled a serial killer,

93
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,240
it fits too well.

94
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,730
No, it's pretty.

95
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,900
And why you? Why are you wanted, too?

96
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,730
It's not you. If you get tangled up too...

97
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,890
I'm okay.

98
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,080
- If we get caught like this... 
 - We won't get caught.

99
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,690
Listen up. We only need to go a little further.

100
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,190
A long as we get out of here, there won't be any CCTV.

101
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,330
We only need to run a little more.

102
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,280
Will you be able to run?

103
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,730
Let's go.

104
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,780

105
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,530
This is really unbelievable.

106
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:20,160
What the hell is this? They killed someone else?

107
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,220
Woo Cheon was the one who put the moss rose in the first place.

108
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,530
But another corpse with that flower showed up again...

109
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,980
Another one? Did Woo Cheon actually–

110
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,180
We started this.

111
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:40,450
But... after that, I really don't know what happened.

112
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,230
A serial killer and a hitman?

113
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,730
Isn't this too dramatic?

114
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:52,490
But I think In Sook is hurt.

115
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,160
I think she collapsed.

116
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,690
What the hell? These guys are doing a face assessment at a time like this?

117
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,710
These crazy assholes.

118
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,290
You jerks, talk after having a look at yourself!

119
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,670
Let's go to Venice.

120
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,950
Huh? How can we go abroad in a situation like this?

121
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:32,210
Tae Il Hyung will prepare forged passports and tickets.

122
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,630
Just hang in there for a little longer.

123
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,030
It's okay.

124
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,700
There are times when things are really urgent.

125
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,410
When I'm late for an appointment... or just when things are urgent,

126
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,670
I run like the wind and get on the bus,

127
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:57,680
and look out the window. To get rid of my nerves.

128
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,420
Because for these 30 minutes when I'm on the bus,

129
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,660
nothing changes, no matter what I do.

130
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,690
So I think, "Let's just rest. Let go."

131
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,620
"Being nervous will change nothing."

132
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,330
We'll be all right for an hour.

133
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:24,130
After that, the sun will set. Let's move then.

134
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,980
But is this cathedral... really safe?

135
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,270
Yeah. It's too far out, so we'll be okay.

136
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,910
How did you know about this place?

137
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,140
I came from time to time.

138
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,030
Why?

139
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,830
To pray.

140
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,720
- What kind of prayer? 
 - I don't remember.

141
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,690
I think I was begging for something.

142
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,240
Let's try once.

143
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,900
Do you have anything to pray for?

144
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,110
No.

145
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,260
You don't?

146
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,870
Yeah.

147
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:11,360
Because I'm fine right now since you're by my side.

148
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,080
Everything is all right.

149
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,550
San Ah!

150
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,020
Are you okay now?

151
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,050
That's a relief. Then, should we go play outside?

152
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,190
Sure.

153
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,140
We'll be playing in the yard.

154
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,340
All right, go on.

155
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,980
You came to cook in the middle of all this?

156
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,330
Are you going to be okay?

157
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,310
I feel like I'm being possessed by a ghost.

158
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:05,280
Don't you tell fortunes? Can you have a look at mine?

159
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,320
How did this happen?

160
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,210
I'm not a person that sees those kinds of things.

161
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,600
Then, what do you see?

162
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,860
You may say that I see people's energy.

163
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:18,840
Everyone has a color, I look at that and read their luck.

164
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,700
She's a con artist.

165
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,710
You know that your color is quite dark, right?

166
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,400
Nothing is clear, it's just dark all the way through.

167
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,880
So, will I live if I'm dark all the way through?

168
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,390
What color do you turn when you die?

169
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:36,080
That's not it! You die when you turn all white.

170
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,450
So annoying!

171
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,240
Does this make any sense?

172
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,310
In Sook just said that she wanted to look at Woo Cheon's face one time,

173
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,130
she ran away to see him even one time.

174
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,520
Since the police can't catch the real culprit,

175
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,450
they're placing the blame on them.

176
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,530
Right? That's what's happening, right?

177
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:57,990
Even still, it is quite refreshing. That man who beat his girlfriend to death died for the best.

178
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,840
People don't even pray for the souls of guys like that.

179
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,000
Maybe it's because I have a daughter too,

180
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,590
but I started shaking when I saw that article. How could someone beat someone up like that?

181
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,780
Is that even human?

182
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,490
Hitman?

183
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,470
What's the deal with them saying that Woo Cheon did something like that?

184
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:19,000
Did In Sook really end up like this because she got involved with him?

185
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,280
Did you see In Sook?

186
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,400
- Before she left here? 
 - Yeah.

187
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,520
She was really sick.

188
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,820
Did they say she was dying?

189
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,080
All of the people here are dying.

190
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,720
Why do you say something like that like it's nothing?

191
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,690
Obviously, it's not nothing...

192
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,090
My mom died, too.

193
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,290
Are you okay?

194
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,170
You miss your mom, don't you?

195
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:57,250
Sometimes I forget... that my mom is not here.

196
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,820
It's better when I forget, so I keep trying to.

197
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,760
"My mom is really gone."

198
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,970
When I feel like that, I get really scared.

199
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:13,310
Everything would be all right if I just had my mom, but she's the only thing that's missing.

200
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:19,880
What if I live here with you, too?

201
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,160
Why? What about your mom?

202
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,570
No... I was just thinking.

203
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,600
A thought.

204
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,840
What did you do?

205
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,720
I prayed.

206
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,620
What did you say?

207
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,080
I asked for forgiveness.

208
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,650
For what?

209
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:15,970
I begged to be forgiven for my sins.

210
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,840
When did things start going wrong?

211
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,670
When I was in middle school.

212
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,850
I killed a classmate of mine.

213
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:52,820
We got in a fight, and it was an accident.

214
00:14:52,820 --> 00:15:00,100
But now that I think about it, I think that I thought

215
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,770
that I would like it if he died.

216
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,100
That kid gave me a really hard time.

217
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,650
So could it have been an accident?

218
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:18,830
Or... did he die because I had those kinds of feelings?

219
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,020
It was an accident.

220
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,460
His family was really rich.

221
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,940
His mom had only one son.

222
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:36,240
That mom followed me my whole life and made me suffer.

223
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:42,410
So that I couldn't do anything, so that I couldn't even breathe.

224
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:50,090
So even when my mom died, we couldn't even go to the hospital.

225
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,520
No one helped us.

226
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,210
Did that fix it? Did that make things even?

227
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,220
Should I just die, too?

228
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,400
I lived while only thinking things like that.

229
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,380
But since I met you,

230
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:26,270
I started wanting to be forgiven.

231
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,640
I'm becoming quite devout.

232
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,730
But... this is the only method we have, isn't it?

233
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,390
No one will recognize us.

234
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,350
I think I'm beginning to feel at peace.

235
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,790
It's like we're going on a trip.

236
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,760
We are going on a trip.

237
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:36,270
These days, I keep thinking of that woman's face.

238
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:40,430
At one point, I hated and resented her,

239
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,200
and wondered if I should get revenge.

240
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,990
I wanted to question her about whether she was finally satisfied...

241
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:53,220
But the last time I saw her face, how should I say...

242
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,190
 What can I do?

243
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:08,640
 Aside from the part that hates you, my entire heart is sad.

244
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,470
 My heart feels like it will break open,

245
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,260
 so I should fill it with loathing.

246
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,960
I think that I might understand.

247
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:30,990
If you were to die like this, I might even kill Koo Ji Pyo.

248
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:36,180
While following him for my whole life, I might even kill him.

249
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,570
So don't give up like this.

250
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,820

251
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,010
The room on the second floor is clean and has an amazing view.

252
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:59,270
But is it all right for a nun and a priest to share a room?

253
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,510
Yes, yes. We are all right.

254
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:06,780
In the business spreading the word, there's no night and day, nor man and woman.

255
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,010
Amen.

256
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,390
 Following the death of a third victim who died with a moss rose in his hair

257
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,370
 on a downtown Seoul rooftop,

258
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,670
 the police have announced an open search.

259
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:19,560
 Serial killer Pyo In Sook and hitman Min Woo Cheon

260
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,740
Why is nobody catching those horrible people?

261
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,620
The world is ending.

262
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,220
Hey!

263
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,640
Ah! I'm not sure where my head is at.

264
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,400
The second-floor room is 50 thousand won,

265
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,030
but I gave back an extra 10 thousand!

266
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,300
Look for it. It'll be there.

267
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,530
Is it possible for us to borrow some comfortable clothes?

268
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:10,840
Of course! But as you can see, I run a sushi bar too.

269
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,790
A fresh mullet came in today. Should I give you a plate?

270
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,960
Why aren't you responding?

271
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,410
I don't like fish.

272
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:24,050
I'll give it to you for cheap! The fish is still jumping!

273
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,160
How are they so hard to find?

274
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,820
Min Woo Cheon is a pro.

275
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,980
This is amateur. The crime scene is messy.

276
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,460
I think he was beaten to death.

277
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,680
The DNA will show up everywhere.

278
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,130
What about the results from the National Forensic Service's autopsy?

279
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,530
I asked them to hurry as fast as possible.

280
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:48,920
The family of the victim's girlfriend who he killed, and the friends and acquaintances around her,

281
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:53,050
as well as anyone who may have any hard feelings. Investigate them all and collect DNA samples.

282
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,850
When are we going to do all of that, now?

283
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,620
Team Leader,

284
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:04,070
I mean, the chief pushing that catching Min Woo Cheon and Pyo In Sook is the first priority,

285
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,620
but you're digging into the third serial murder case again.

286
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,930
Look around! Everyone is exhausted.

287
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:13,050
- Is this a serial murder? 
 - I don't know either.

288
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:16,670
It's not a serial murder. You think the same thing.

289
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:20,710
We're gaining momentum, so we can't stop.

290
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,420
At this rate, everything will be broken.

291
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,610
Living here trapped like this,

292
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,520
doesn't look happy.

293
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,840
If you leave, you die.

294
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,310
I thought that my life was like that, too.

295
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:50,630
Trapped, puffing, puffing...

296
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,920
Barely dying or living,

297
00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:01,630
I want to get out, but I don't know where to go or how to get out.

298
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,240
Just the feeling of living trapped like that.

299
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,850
I just barely got out.

300
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,390
But I'm dying.

301
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,790
I thought that I might become happy, somehow.

302
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:22,590
I thought that I had just made it...

303
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:26,260
So I ended up wanting to do so many things...

304
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,590
What happened?

305
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:39,740
Another person was killed? Could it have been Koo Ji Pyo?

306
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,540
He took the phone

307
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:46,850
and the video is in his hands. Why would he?

308
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:01,430
It's raining quite a bit.

309
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,350
I know, right?

310
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:09,740
Do you like being outside when it rains or inside?

311
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,200
Inside.

312
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:16,910
It's raining so hard outside,

313
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:23,850
but if I'm inside like this, I'm cozy and safe.

314
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,060
Me too.

315
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,990
I used to like getting rained on.

316
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:35,980
But now, I really like being inside like this.

317
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,190
I like the smell of rain.

318
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,440
And...

319
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,600
the smell of you.

320
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,620
I think you're running a fever.

321
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,350
I'm not.

322
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,830
You are.

323
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,790
I'm flying.

324
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,010
Wow...

325
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:52,720
I don't want to sleep, but I keep falling asleep.

326
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,020
Sleep.

327
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:09,990
It would be nice if I didn't wake up this time.

328
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:36,230

329
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,930

330
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:59,940

331
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,960
What kind of fairy tale is that sad?

332
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,120
It died so horribly one million times?

333
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,590
But it wasn't a big deal, because it was born again.

334
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:18,820
But it met the white cat and wanted to be by its side for the first time.

335
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:23,430
That's when it finally learned what death was and cried for the first time.

336
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:27,920
Like that, it died after crying one million times.

337
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,950
And it wasn't born again.

338
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,730
It's okay to not be born again.

339
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:36,600
Because it lived a sincere life.

340
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,810
How come you guys are more grown up than I am?

341
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:07,270
I waited to see the sun rising.

342
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:14,650
It already rose, it's radiant.

343
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,060
I couldn't see it.

344
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:22,760
This is the western sea. The sun doesn't rise at the western sea, anyway.

345
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,160
Really?

346
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,880
Let's go to the eastern sea next time.

347
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,210
Next time...

348
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,720
No,

349
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,520
let's go to Venice.

350
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:24,560

351
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,840
What's wrong?

352
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:35,220
I think Hyung is being chased, too.

353
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,800
We can't go then.

354
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,270
It's fine.

355
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:45,470
Venice isn't Heaven, anyway.

356
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,210
I don't want to go.

357
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,200
Don't you think they look familiar?

358
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,690
I think I've seen them before, too.

359
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,740
Isn't it that person?

360
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,610
Are you okay? We are almost there.

361
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,250
It's enough.

362
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,500
What?

363
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,020
There's nowhere else to go.

364
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,150
No.

365
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,760
It's only a matter of time before we get caught.

366
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,590
I'll stay with you until that happens.

367
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:15,350
I think I'm okay now.

368
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,980
I ran away to see you, I saw you,

369
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,990
and I was happy to see you.

370
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:28,370
- So now... 
 - I'm not okay.

371
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:31,040
Because I saw you, I'm not okay.

372
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,440
I don't want to let go. I won't let you go.

373
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:42,280
Listen to me carefully. You're not related to this murder case.

374
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,420
You'll receive some sort of punishment for your sins of the past, but you weren't involved in this one.

375
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,320
That detective will know.

376
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,700
Since I turned myself in and ran away, when I go there, I'll ask them to keep you out of it.

377
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,700
No.

378
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:59,010
I'm sick. I feel like I'm going to die.

379
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:02,090
But I can't even express my pain because I feel sorry about it.

380
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:07,140
I miss my grandmother, too.

381
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,870
Please.

382
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,880
I'm okay now.

383
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,600
I can smile now.

384
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,680
We need to go the hospital first.

385
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,240
The intersection in front of the express bus terminal. Hurry.

386
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:18,050
It'll be hard to redirect the investigation if we keep this up.

387
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:21,240
- Huh? 
 - We've publicized the wanted orders.

388
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,150
The entire world is focused on those two.

389
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:27,090
We can't expose this mistake without some sort of alternative.

390
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:29,070
- You do it. 
 - Do what?

391
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:33,150
You keep working for Jo Jia.

392
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,280
What are you going to do?

393
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,560
I'm going to think of an alternative before it's too late.

394
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,420
- Medicine. 
 - What?

395
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,610
In the bag.

396
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,590
Wait here a minute. I'll go buy it quickly.

397
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,200
Please give me this medicine.

398
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,630
We can't sell this medicine without a doctor's prescription.

399
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,240
Please. I'm begging you.

400
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,380
I can't.

401
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:27,370
Then,  any painkillers.

402
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,840
If you're a brain tumor patient, it won't be useful.

403
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,760
You need to go to the hospital quickly. She might go into shock.

404
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,460
Please!

405
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,320

406
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,350
Mi-Min-Min Ji, are you okay?

407
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:52,100
 Yes. Someone helped us move.

408
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,240
W-Who?

409
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,100
 Some man named Kevin helped us move.

410
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,250
 Give Mom the phone.

411
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:03,630
 Are you okay? Hello?

412
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:06,760
Honey, are you really okay?

413
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,960
 We're fine.

414
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,520
Honey, don't worry...

415
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,480
Honey!

416
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,450
Team Leader, where were you?

417
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:21,550
There were some YouTubers who had been following the third victim.

418
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,800
Yes, so?

419
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,440
I looked through all their footage and found something taken near the site of the crime.

420
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,460
I went into that home without notice, to investigate,

421
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,610
and found other related videos.

422
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:36,960
On the rooftop of that building, the victim got into a fight.

423
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,480
Not against one person, but multiple.

424
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,380
One of those corresponds with the DNA found on site.

425
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,300
What are you planning to do?

426
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,180
We'll have to wait for the forensics results.

427
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,200
We need to know the exact cause of death.

428
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,180
This way.

429
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,780
W-Wait.

430
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,260
P-P-Please.

431
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,530
I'm sorry.

432
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,430
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

433
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:15,230
What?

434
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,960
You're alive. You're alive.

435
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,230
You're alive.

436
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:49,200
I really thought I was going to die.

437
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:56,450
But why are we crying? Do we have this kind of friendship?

438
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,440
I t-thought you were dead, but you're a-alive so I...

439
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,650
Koo Ji Pyo suddenly told me to leave for Buenos Aires.

440
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:08,360
But something felt off, you know. So I sent someone else.

441
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:15,240
Turns out, a car slammed into him as soon as he stepped out of the airport... and killed him.

442
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,770
I fled to another country. Park Seung Seon is dead.

443
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:23,730
I'm Kevin now.

444
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:27,180
- Huh? 
 - I'm 12 years old.

445
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:32,620
Doing dirty work like we do, the system fails us.

446
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:37,660
W-Wait a minute.

447
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:40,470
Kevin? Kevin?!

448
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:45,670
T-Then the person who h-helped my family was...

449
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:50,800
I thought they would kill your wife and kid.

450
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,400
Get it together, jerk.

451
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,940
Let's think about it now.

452
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,470
Let's rethink our relationship.

453
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:03,440
What should I want from you?

454
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:10,390

455
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,820
Look.

456
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,940
I'm in this mess and already this broken,

457
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,110
you wanted to see me in this kind of misery.

458
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,570
You want me to be unhappy.

459
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,180
I don't think so.

460
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:42,280
It's okay to report or whatever you want to do,

461
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,050
but this person...

462
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:49,680
Please help her to not be so sick.

463
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,920
The fever is already cooled down. She's stable for now.

464
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,570
In the morning, bring her to the hospital.

465
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,040
Thank you.

466
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,340
I'm sorry.

467
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:33,150
Eun Hyuk talked about you once before.

468
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:35,400
He was jealous of you.

469
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,540
He said you were poor and couldn't afford to attend academies,

470
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:42,900
but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't beat you.

471
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,860
So I told him,

472
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:51,270
"Don't be jealous of him but hate him. If you're jealous, you can't win.

473
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:54,190
So hate him instead,

474
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,200
and win."

475
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:02,110
At one point, I thought I was the one who made him that way.

476
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:07,080
But I couldn't blame myself.

477
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:11,320
So I chose to blame you instead.

478
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:16,440
If only you were a bad kid, could my Eun Hyuk be remembered as good.

479
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:21,370
No mother in the world can admit that their child is bad.

480
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:27,420
Eun Hyuk gave me a gift once before.

481
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,190
When my gym uniform ripped,

482
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:34,300
I just cut off the sleeves and continued wearing it. I couldn't afford a new one.

483
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:41,630
But Eun Hyuk gave me a new uniform.

484
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:44,050
But I didn't take it from him.

485
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:48,320
"How will he bully me this time? Why is he suddenly being so kind?"

486
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,980
That's what I thought.

487
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:59,230
But... I keep remembering that moment.

488
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,400
The way he cracked a shy smile...

489
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:08,580
as he handed me the new uniform.

490
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:31,530
The complete succession of stake ownership

491
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,320
seems like it'll take a bit more time.

492
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,920
 Do you think Koo Ji Pyo committed the third murder?

493
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,950
No.

494
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,650
Koo Ji Pyo is very timid.

495
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,500
He's a total coward.

496
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:53,610
B-But there's n-nothing we can d-do now.

497
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:57,870
He has Ha Yong Geun's phone

498
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:00,370
and we d-don't have that v-video anymore either.

499
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:03,930
- I have that video. 
 - What?

500
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:08,450
Ha Yong Geun came to me initially, asking if I wanted to work with him.

501
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:11,980
To threaten Koo Ji Pyo, get some money out of him, and split it.

502
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:15,080
But Koo Ji Pyo gave me an offer as well.

503
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,730
To get rid of Ha Yong Geun.

504
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:21,210
Given these options, which would you choose?

505
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:25,080
W-What are you going to do?

506
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:31,420
I'm worried about Woo Cheon and In Sook.

507
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:35,260
I was so surprised they were wanted.

508
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:38,090
Your pour soul must've been shocked by this all.

509
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,930
Unfortunately, this is a case we're still investigating...

510
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:44,770
So... were you able to find any evidence?

511
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,180
What?

512
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,520
No, not yet.

513
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:54,010
 Are you doing well?

514
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,930
Are you doing well?

515
00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:00,070
Hello?

516
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:02,760
I'm really sorry, miss, we actually got CCTV footage of them,

517
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,560
but I can't reveal this information to you.

518
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,200
I think this is our fate. I'm sorry.

519
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,020
Unnie, are you okay?

520
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:23,400
It seemed like you weren't able to sleep a wink yesterday either.

521
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,180
If I sleep,

522
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,600
I'm afraid I will die.

523
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:32,900
That's what I'm most afraid of these days.

524
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,270
Don't say things like that.

525
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:39,000
Once you leave after getting married,

526
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,300
I'll be left alone.

527
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:48,140
That's a relief.

528
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:52,630
Spending time with you and In Sook,

529
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,790
together,

530
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:57,700
made me happy.

531
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,620
What's wrong with you?

532
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:04,320
Stop saying things like that.

533
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:17,060
Hello.

534
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:19,130
Wait a minute.

535
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,430
Unnie is not okay right now.

536
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:27,110
Oh, really?

537
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:30,830
I saw the article. Congrats.

538
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:34,000
Thank you.

539
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,820
Mi Do, want to go look for a house?

540
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:42,330
A house? Who's house?

541
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:45,930
- Our house. 
 - Our house?!

542
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:49,400
I'm checking CCTV footage of pharmacies and hospitals in the area,

543
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,670
but nothing is coming up.

544
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,610
We don't have the time to check all that.

545
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:02,640
Cha Myeong Ju.

546
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,770
Cha Myeong Ju.

547
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,520
Cha Myeong Ju.

548
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:34,560
Where are we?

549
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,530
- Are you okay? 
 - Yeah.

550
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:46,050
Who is this?

551
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:49,660
That kid.

552
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:53,880
The friend... I killed.

553
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:00,750
That kid's mother helped us.

554
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,800
You were forgiven.

555
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:17,620
What a relief.

556
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,620
Really a relief.

557
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:51,940
Go buy anything you want at the department store.

558
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:54,630
I'll set a date for the wedding as soon as possible.

559
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:56,460
Really?

560
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:00,560
Am I really going to live in this house?

561
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,260
Of course. That's the bedroom.

562
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,570
I ordered the bed first.

563
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:09,060
I can't believe it.

564
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:16,260
Ever since I was young, I liked dramatic things.

565
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:19,390
But life... isn't really like that.

566
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:22,230
It's pitiful and boring.

567
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:26,760
Ever since I've become terminally ill,

568
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:30,610
everything's become so theatrical.

569
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:33,060
Maybe that's why I'm here.

570
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,850
But I'm not sure...

571
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:39,490
if it's okay for me to be so happy

572
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,610
all alone.

573
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:43,530
You can.

574
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:46,840
- Really? 
 - Yes.

575
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:54,860
I heard somewhere that when you meet someone you really want to be with,

576
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:59,830
when you live a sincere life, you don't need to be reborn.

577
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:03,540
I guess I won't need to be reborn, either.

578
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,440
Right?

579
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:35,980
It's been a while since I've prepared breakfast.

580
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,410
I set aside some medicine as well.

581
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:56,700
You're not at the bottom, it's a relief.

582
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,670
You're not miserable, it's a relief.

583
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:02,990
I was breaking down, just like you.

584
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:09,090
Protect her well.

585
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:26,890
What's this? What's going on?

586
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:30,070
She suddenly started convulsing, and her anemia has gotten worse.

587
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:32,610
Unnie. Unnie, are you okay?

588
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:34,320
What's wrong with you suddenly?

589
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,400
The house.

590
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,340
- What? 
 - Did you get to see your house?

591
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:42,500
That's not important right now.

592
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,000
Unnie, you'll be okay.

593
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,500
If you die like this, I'll kill you.

594
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,320
She's not going to die.

595
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:53,910
Unnie.

596
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,140
 One, two, three.

597
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:24,240
 One, two, three.

598
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:37,790
 We're in this together. On the same side!

599
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:30,590
Why didn't you tell me your condition had gotten so poor?

600
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:34,290
The doctors said your symptoms must've been severe.

601
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:36,530
Just because.

602
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:40,290
I had too many things to do.

603
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:47,890
While staying at the hospice,

604
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:52,530
I noticed all cancer patients die suddenly.

605
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:54,440
They're fine one day,

606
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:58,540
but their conditions worsen suddenly, over a week.

607
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,360
Out of nowhere.

608
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:06,220
I don't know when it started, but every morning,

609
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:10,020
I started getting scared

610
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:13,240
that day would come to me, too.

611
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
You've grown into a charismatic woman.

612
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,360
Have a seat here.

613
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:42,210
Parents don't know their children.

614
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:46,680
It's a mistake to think they know everything, just because they gave birth to them.

615
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:52,000
I had always crossed the line.

616
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,040
It wasn't for you, but for me.

617
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:00,730
I wanted you to be

618
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:04,100
in the place I wanted you to be.

619
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:07,160
That's why I wouldn't let you be.

620
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,740
- I... 
 - Mom.

621
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:12,660
I always leaned on you.

622
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:15,990
You were my child,

623
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:22,270
my husband, my friend, my everything.

624
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:27,550
So I placed too much of a burden on you.

625
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:29,610
I'm sorry.

626
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:34,440
You don't have to worry about me anymore.

627
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:37,090
I'm living with a widowed friend and it's nice.

628
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:39,430
It's so fun.

629
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,870
What a relief.

630
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,980
I'm going to stand on my own now.

631
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:52,290
I'm going to live my life to its fullest.

632
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:54,740
So don't worry about me,

633
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:57,940
and stand up yourself.

634
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:01,570
Don't worry too much. She'll get up.

635
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:05,740
Yoon Seo, thank you.

636
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:17,160
We caught them on CCTV footage near Cha Myeong Ju's Pediatric Clinic.

637
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,520
Salutations.

638
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,940
Where are they?

639
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:24,820
We've confirmed through CCTV footage that they escaped with the clinic director.

640
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:28,240
- Why would they escape with the clinic director? 
 - Min Woo Cheon is acquainted with her.

641
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,490
- In middle school, Min Woo Ch— 
 - Request support ASAP.

642
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:32,490
- Go surround her house. 
 - Understood.

643
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:35,180
Let's go! Come on!

644
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,290

645
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:11,260
Is it you, In Sook?

646
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,420
What're you here for?

647
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:17,580
There are police everywhere!

648
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:20,170
I have nowhere to go.

649
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,620
I'm sure In Sook doesn't have anywhere to go either.

650
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:32,600
Goodness!

651
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,540
I'm crazy! My daughter is dying

652
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,970
and I blabbered on and on about Venice being Heaven.

653
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:41,700
Crazy!

654
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:53,800
- They said they were going to Venice. 
 - What?

655
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:57,480
She said she was going to Venice with Woo Cheon.

656
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,710
Do you think they made it?

657
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:02,150
Venice?

658
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:06,400
You know that kid, Woo Cheon.

659
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,300
Is he really a hit man?

660
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:11,070
I don't know! I don't understand

661
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:12,820
anything that's going on.

662
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:15,080
He didn't seem like one.

663
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,270
You met him?

664
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:20,200
They came to my shop once.

665
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,460
- Really? 
 - She said he was her boyfriend.

666
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:26,790
It felt strange.

667
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:29,860
But I didn't dislike him.

668
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:33,880
He seemed like he had a screw loose in his head,

669
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,670
but he reminded me a bit of myself.

670
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:38,950
They say daughters tend to meet men like their fathers—

671
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:41,700
Absolutely not! That won't do.

672
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,940
Right, that won't do.

673
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:52,040
I wonder wherever they are if they've been eating properly.

674
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,060
What are they doing?

675
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:56,480
My heart aches so much I could die.

676
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,180
Mom, I don't think this is right.

677
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:01,140
They didn't do it!

678
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:03,560
Must we just sit back and watch?

679
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,020
Shouldn't we be protesting somewhere?

680
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:09,050
Shouldn't we step up?

681
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:13,990
It's fun.

682
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,240
Huh?

683
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,770
I briefly saw the news earlier,

684
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:24,110
and we're heroes.

685
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:28,480
Janitors that clean the trash of this world.

686
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:33,790
Sure, I started all of this.

687
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:37,150
I told myself I would take a bad guy with me.

688
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:41,570
I'm sure that was anger.

689
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:44,970
Anger towards the world that couldn't protect a single child,

690
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:48,550
and towards the world that ostracized me.

691
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:54,140
But things have spiraled out of my control

692
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,930
and we're running for our lives.

693
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:06,570
When will this end?

694
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:11,540
How will it end?

695
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:27,480

696
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:45,920
 The police have surrounded the house. If you go near the kitchen,

697
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,910
 there's a door that leads to an alleyway.

698
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:51,000
 Take that way out.

699
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:11,230
Head to the second floor!

700
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:16,920
Hey, check the veranda.

701
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,610
Check inside there.

702
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:24,850
Hey, over here!

703
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:23,630

704
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:27,740
♫  Stay with me   ♫

705
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:31,600
♫  In your memory...  ♫

706
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:34,980
 Miracles must exist. I've completely healed.

707
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:37,240
 I ignored you once you got sick.

708
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,620
 I can't do anything without you.

709
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:42,240
 Why can't you make eye contact with me?

710
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,340
 I feel like you're being very careful.

711
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,990
 Now, you must make decisions solely based on the influence it will have on the company.

712
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:49,060
 Are you going to start living at the chaebol's house?

713
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:51,290
 We'll torment him with the video,

714
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:52,640
 win big, then pretend we didn't do it.

715
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:53,650
 Where did Min Woo Cheon go?

716
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:56,350
 If this happens, Min Woo Cheon must also speak the truth.

717
01:00:56,350 --> 01:01:00,360
 Do you really think that marrying a man like that, oblivious to it all, can truly be a happy ending?

718
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,320
 You knew?

719
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,930
 If her love wavers,

720
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:05,120
 Mi Do will break down.

721
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:10,360
♫  I will be the light  ♫
