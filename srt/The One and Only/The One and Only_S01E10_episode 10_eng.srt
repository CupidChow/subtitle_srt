1
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,950
 I'm sorry.

2
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,160
 Be it just an hour or even a day,

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,790
 I have to protect you.

4
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,360

5
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,090
 Two years ago, at the age of 27, he was promoted to an executive.

6
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,880
 Now, he has been promoted to Vice President...

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,050
He is so cool!

8
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,190
 Recently, due to his romance of the century with a famous influencer, Sung Mi Do, the stock price is rising.

9
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,500
Oh! It's me.

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,980
 He has the capability...

11
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,220
My goodness. It's going to be chaotic!

12
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,200
I understand. All right.

13
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,490
- What is this? 
 -  Did you really kill him?

14
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,990
 Oh my god! Girl crush.  
  Did you kill Park Doo Jin too?

15
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,660
 On Ho Seon's birthday. That day, right?

16
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,560
 Ho Seon uploaded a video about her police investigation.

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,360
 Recently, I was investigated by the police.

18
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,780
 I was so flustered because nothing like this has happened to me before.

19
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,610
What? Is she crazy?

20
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,060
What do I do now?

21
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,130
Why is this here?

22
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,860
What to do?

23
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,960
- What do we do? Woo Cheon ran away. 
 - What?

24
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,320
It's so relieving. That's right, you knew everything.

25
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,680
Woo Cheon, just give it to him and let's end this. Please!

26
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,530
Didn't I ask you to trust me?

27
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,880
He also has a brain. How can he believe you?

28
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,280
But why are you doing this?

29
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,290
We are here because you didn't do the task properly.

30
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,350
What can you do with the phone? That lady killed that guy.

31
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:13,580
That is the fact, but you didn't let her turn herself in. That's why I came this far.

32
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,470
The reason you came this far is in this.

33
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,990
 You are so rich, do you really have to do this?

34
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,490
 Do you know how much pocket money this is?

35
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,150
 Hey. It's a billion won. Upload it quickly.

36
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,090
 It is really crazy there.

37
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,920
 There are all sorts of videos there.

38
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,470
 But the guy who operated it made millions and got caught.

39
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,690
 But he was only imprisoned for a year.

40
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,400
It was you.

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,680
And the guy who went in for a year was a dummy.

42
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,150
Things just got complicated. I mistakenly sent this to Ha Yong Geun.

43
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,420
Ha Yong Geun was the main customer.

44
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,320
But he suddenly bit me back and threatened me.

45
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,620
Well, what could I do? He didn't listen at all, so I had to get rid of him.

46
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,630
But you ruined everything. Killing a person was the first time for me.

47
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:08,050
But you have done it a lot of times, right? Why did you mess up?

48
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,950
If you had done everything properly, we wouldn't be here.

49
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,540
I came this far cleaning your shit.

50
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,360
No. We are here because of your shit.

51
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,290
All right. I understand it's a bad thing.

52
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,370
Honestly, I didn't think it would become such a hit.

53
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,760
But I studied with that money. I earned it myself.

54
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,320
You're not given all the money in the world just because you're born into a rich family. That's how my father raised me.

55
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,410
I always had to show my abilities.

56
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:39,180
Stop your bullshit. Write those things in your autobiography.

57
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,950
It's all over. But you can't hold me back on it now.

58
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,630
My future is too brilliant for that.

59
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,170
So the one who isn't brilliant should disappear.

60
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,450
You killed Park Doo Jin, too. Right?

61
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,800
Now stop asking me.

62
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:25,960

63
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,800
You didn't tell me it'd be him.

64
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,810
Now leave.

65
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,080
The situation is bad.

66
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,970
Testimony on Min Woo Cheon's murder charge has been obtained.

67
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,390
In this situation, escape is likely considered a confession.

68
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,570
Woo Cheon is not related to this case.

69
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,770
I will tell you everything.

70
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,240
Let's first go inside.

71
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,590
Yes. That day, the three of us went under the bridge.

72
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,000
San Ah was hiding in the closet.

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,830
The moment that guy tried to capture San Ah—

74
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,250
You took a golf club to hit and kill him.

75
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:36,520
But he didn't die. Although I thought he was dead at that time.

76
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,860
After that, when we went to the club, I stepped out for some time. I went under the bridge again.

77
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,650
- How did you go there? 
 - Taxi.

78
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,430
Alone? You rode the taxi and went there?

79
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,410
I was worried about my grandma.

80
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,230
Leaving the body there also seemed off.

81
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,710
But he was alive.

82
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:58,260
When I saw him, he was moving and opened his eyes.

83
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,210
In a reflex, I choked him.

84
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,310
It's his watch.

85
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,290
I took it thinking I could make money out of it.

86
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,850
 I did it.

87
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:22,400
 I came by as I was worried about San Ah. That guy was lying unconscious.

88
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,650
 But he suddenly opened his eyes.

89
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,650
 I was really scared so I choked his neck.

90
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,740
 But, unknowingly, I was doing it strongly.

91
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,800
 And he died. Very easily.

92
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,420
 At that time, I saw this wedding watch.

93
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,140
 Even in that situation, I had this thought.

94
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:54,500
 I could get money by selling this watch. Then, along with San Ah, somehow...

95
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,370
 I wanted to turn myself in.

96
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,880
 But now I don't understand anything. What's with the flower?

97
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,020
 What's with the serial murder case? I was just so scared—

98
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,390
 Think about only one thing.

99
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:19,420
 San Ah needs her mother.

100
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,390
 - But— 
 - It's all right.

101
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,980
 Anyway, I am going to die soon.

102
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,210
 Please stay by San Ah's side.

103
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,110
 Protect her well.

104
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,940
White color, search for 398.

105
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,720
All right.

106
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,960
We found the car.

107
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,870
- Search for a CCTV nearby. 
 - Okay, got it.

108
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,130
Yes. Looks like he ran away leaving the car behind.

109
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,420
Okay, first come back. Pyo In Sook has turned herself in.

110
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,120
In Sook is talking to the detective now.

111
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,800
- Why? 
 - Woo Cheon ran away.

112
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,090
But why is the detective questioning In Sook?

113
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,090
I don't know. Woo Cheon, really!

114
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:42,280
You both must go to the Director's office.

115
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:58,040
Yes. In Sook had left the club in the middle.

116
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,320
She wasn't there for about an hour.

117
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,830
Well, I was busy greeting my friends.

118
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:10,680
When? When did In Sook leave? That never happened, right?

119
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,390
You don't remember anything, right?

120
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:17,430
In Sook was worried about her grandmother, so I drove her there.

121
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,460
Because Se Yeon had brought the golf club, I had to go to that division.

122
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:26,000
We went to the club as we had to slip out of that place soon.

123
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,240
But this isn't aiding or cooperating in murder, right?

124
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,700
Then, what about Park Doo Jin?

125
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,660
- What? That is— 
 - Yes.

126
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,950
Hey.

127
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,180
At first, I killed with the intent of taking along one bad guy.

128
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,350
But everyone seemed to like it.

129
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,390
I thought I did a good job. I didn't have any regrets.

130
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:50,720
So, I knew that Park Doo Jin was living in that neighborhood—

131
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,790
This doesn't make sense.

132
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,280
She has already turned herself in.

133
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,380
The hair strand detected in Park Doo Jin's shirt button

134
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,030
matches with Pyo In Sook's DNA.

135
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,600
But she can't explain how Park Doo Jin was murdered.

136
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,440
Last time, when Min Woo Cheon had surrendered, we released him saying he didn't know about the death due to suffocation. This time...

137
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,670
It's too simple.

138
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,800
Should everything be complicated? It's simple sometimes.

139
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,970
This is a serial murder committed by Pyo In Sook. Do you really believe that?

140
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,770
What can I believe, without evidence?

141
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,820
All the evidence is pointing at Pyo In Sook.

142
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,290
The higher-ups want the case to be closed somehow—

143
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,210
If you are going to do everything the higher-ups say, why do the investigation?

144
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:40,100
If not, then bring the evidence.

145
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,270
- What about Min Woo Cheon? 
 - He left the car and ran away.

146
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,500
Give me Min Woo Cheon's whereabouts.

147
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,440
First, take Pyo In Sook into custody.

148
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,680
You go to the hospice.

149
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,610

150
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,960

151
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,030

152
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,680

153
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,360

154
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,570
Are you awake now?

155
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,350
The public is interesting.

156
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:35,190
Ha Yong Geun died with the flower on him. Once the public knew he was a bad guy, everyone was excited.

157
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,710
That's why I thought.

158
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:41,030
Pyo In Sook won't confess and you will fight hard.

159
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,690
Then, what should I do?

160
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,730
I should make up a situation.

161
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:48,560
I should show what the public wants to see.

162
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,250
 Park Doo Jin? Why?

163
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,710
 He is a bad guy.

164
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:57,270
 The public is the most upset with him right now. Aren't you angry?

165
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:00,860
 Yes— Yes, I am angry.

166
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,630
 That's why. Kill him.

167
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,610
If I ignite it once, it will roll on its own later.

168
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,980
Whatever be the truth, the public runs toward their preset conclusions.

169
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,950
Riding on speculations and rumors.

170
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,400
Please move. This is obstructing my duty.

171
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,720
You cannot go.

172
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,680
I...

173
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,230
Hello.

174
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,820
- It will be night soon. 
 - What?

175
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,660
It's sleeping time soon. Taking the patient at this time is

176
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,660
- a little... 
 - But this is a serious matter—

177
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,740
- There are reporters also outside. 
 - Yes.

178
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,190
I understand your worries... but...

179
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,630
I feel very uncomfortable...

180
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,300
Taking her into custody would be hard.

181
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,200
What?

182
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,140
Pyo In Sook's test results from last week are out.

183
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,730
The size of the tumor has increased by two times.

184
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,160
We don't know when she will collapse.

185
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,680
- The police also have medical staff. 
 - It's a dangerous situation.

186
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,770
We have to check her condition closely.

187
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,340
If you take her by force and if she dies at the police station,

188
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,690
won't there be more backlash?

189
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,700
Oppa isn't picking up my calls.

190
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,550
I am being called a murderer now...

191
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:47,130
You were lying, right?

192
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,760
Did In Sook really step out in the middle?

193
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,030
- Even I don't know that. 
 - What?

194
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,700
In Sook asked me to say that.

195
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,370
 Let's go inside.

196
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,090
 What happened?

197
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,400
 - Listen carefully. You can repeat everything that I say, right? 
 - What?

198
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,800
 Say that I left in the middle of the party on that day, for about an hour. You don't know where I went.

199
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,420
 What are you saying? Did Woo Cheon really kill him?

200
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,860
 Are you taking responsibility for it all on your own?

201
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,020
 Hey. Get yourself together.

202
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,990
 Then, will you take all the blame? Everyone outside is saying that you are the murderer.

203
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,960
Whether she is taking all the blame instead of Woo Cheon, or...

204
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,690
Even I don't what's going on.

205
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,590
She just asked me to say that.

206
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,590
So that's why you spoke like that?

207
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,230
Now, In Sook has become a serial murderer.

208
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,940
I didn't say anything about Park Doo Jin, right.

209
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,110
Just say it's not the case. Tell the truth quickly.

210
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,610
- What if that's what In Sook wanted? 
 - What?

211
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,580
That's right. Surely there's something going on.

212
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,680
May be it's not us who killed him.

213
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,150
Otherwise, why would Woo Cheon run away?

214
00:14:55,150 --> 00:15:00,510
It looks like In Sook is taking up the blame now, for his sake.

215
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,800
If it's In Sook's choice, what will you do?

216
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,120
Now, are you telling me it's for In Sook's sake?

217
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,070
Yes. Just let me be the bad bitch.

218
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:12,740
But I am about to become a serial murderer.

219
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,510
If it keeps going this way, would this wedding be possible?

220
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:20,890
It's a miracle that he wants to marry me who is terminally ill and has nothing else.

221
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:25,200
If I become a serial murderer, would this wedding be possible?

222
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,910
I also want Woo Cheon to be captured and end this.

223
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,530
I am really disappointed in you.

224
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:43,370
Why are looking for alcohol in the day? It hasn't been long since you stopped drinking.

225
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,650
Did lying make you overly anxious?

226
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:51,960
You even forged the medical records. You're good at acting.

227
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,280
What are you saying?

228
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,230
Pyo In Sook. You did that to stop her from being taken away.

229
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,010
It's real though.

230
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,960
What?

231
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,600
The tumor suddenly grew bigger.

232
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,840
I will look at the situation and take her into custody.

233
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,010
And all related people are here. I will just wrap up the investigation here.

234
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,360
Okay. Got it.

235
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,630
Prepare for the midway briefing.

236
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:19,970
Pyo In Sook's confession is not perfect yet.

237
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,270
She confessed, and her hair strand was also detected. What else do you want?

238
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,190
Now the internet is chaotic saying Sung Mi Do is the culprit.

239
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,310
You should provide clarification before catching someone.

240
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,450
I request a search in the area where the hospice vehicle had stopped.

241
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,500
- What? 
 - Min Woo Cheon has escaped.

242
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,480
Hand over the detective agency's side to the separate investigation.

243
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,080
Do the midway briefing and quickly complete the on-site inspection.

244
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,820
I will go there now.

245
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:44,230
Hey! You jerk...

246
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,700
Are you getting in the way of the investigation?

247
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,460
What? Getting in the way?

248
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,310
Why are you ruining what's almost complete?

249
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:58,150
The investigation is not over yet. The briefing is too early.

250
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:02,020
- What are you doing? 
 - We can't see this as a serial murder case.

251
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,400
Why? We have the evidence and a personal statement.

252
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,730
The crime scene doesn't say the same thing.

253
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,610
Is the crime scene only saying that to you?

254
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:13,200
You have always been like this.

255
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,900
- I request support for a search in that area. 
 - Out!

256
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:22,700
It's a mutiny, disobeying the order! You get a suspension for two months.

257
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,000
Director!

258
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:31,950
The suspect is a woman who was a neighbor of the victim.

259
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:36,540
After committing the crime to protect the abused child,

260
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:41,650
she confessed that she murdered the second victim, Park Doo Jin, out of an intoxicated sense of justice.

261
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,260
But we need more in-depth investigation at this point.

262
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,890
We are figuring out the exact motive for the crime and her route

263
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,750
to focus on reconstructing the crime scene.

264
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,740
I'll take the questions now.

265
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,620
- Is it Ms. Sung Mi Do? 
 - No, it's not.

266
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,490
Then, why do you need to investigate the host of the party that Sung Mi Do attended on that day? What's the relation?

267
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,850
We are under investigation.

268
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,260
Please refrain from rash speculations.

269
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:10,700
What about Mi Do? Were you sincere to her?

270
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,050
I don't know.

271
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,780
Of course, I knew Mi Do regardless of this incident.

272
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,630
But our relationship got all tangled up by pure coincidence.

273
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:23,370
The three of them killed Ha Yong Geun and then they came to the club.

274
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,790
I was hooked on that day. Is it fate?

275
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:30,190
Right? Isn't that love?

276
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,510
- Why... 
 - What?

277
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,000
Why do you live like that?

278
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,740
How can you say it like that? I'm trying my best to live well.

279
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,500
It's too bad. If we didn't meet each other like this, we could've been friends.

280
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,380
You and I are similar people.

281
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,940
When I thought of killing Park Doo Jin, I got so excited.

282
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,020
This bastard. I get to kill this trashy being.

283
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,570
I was exhilarated.

284
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,950
I felt like...

285
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,960
This is what it is.

286
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,350
I heard you only kill bad people.

287
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:12,070
I guess you must have been bored listening to me.

288
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,400
It's almost over.

289
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,850

290
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,100
Haven't you heard about it?

291
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,540
Apparently, Ms. Pyo In Sook admitted to the crime.

292
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,650
What? Who confessed what?

293
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,960
Ms. Pyo In Sook.

294
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:36,230
Is it you? You're not the one, are you?

295
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:39,190
What kind of nonsense is this?

296
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:43,620
Why would you do that? How can you kill a person?

297
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,030
I'm sorry.

298
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,690
No, no. I know it!

299
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,080
You're not the criminal!

300
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:55,280
I shouldn't have gotten hit then.

301
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,160
I shouldn't have called you on that day.

302
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:04,010
I should've just died when I got beaten.

303
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:09,430
No, I should've killed that bastard on that day!

304
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,860
Grandma...

305
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,890
Let's do it that way.

306
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:19,010
Detective, let's say I killed the people.

307
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,710
Can't we do that?

308
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:26,550
She's not the one! She's not the killer!

309
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,400
She's not someone who'd do that.

310
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
She's not the one! I'm serious!

311
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,320
Why are you crying? Why?!

312
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,400
You didn't commit the crime. What makes you feel wrong to cry for?

313
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,660
In Sook, tell me.

314
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,650
In Sook, say something.

315
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,980
Tell them you're not the one.

316
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,320
Just say you're not, then I'll do something. Okay?

317
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,910
Just say you're not the killer... Why don't you say something?

318
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:56,210
Why would you do that? Why?

319
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,730
How do you kill people though?

320
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:07,480
If you were me, how would you kill yourself?

321
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,400
I've only ordered it but never killed someone myself before.

322
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,640
But I'm going to do it this time because things keep going sideways. Since this will be the last time.

323
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,140
You can't do it.

324
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,400
- Why not? 
 - Because it's your first time.

325
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,170
There's a first for everyone. Including yourself.

326
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,890
I failed the first time, too.

327
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:33,020
It's like that the first time. But you can't afford to fail this one.

328
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,610
Things won't come to an end then.

329
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,700
There's a lifespan to buildings, too.

330
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:47,760
This was built with reinforced concrete, but because they used cheap materials the building is cracking already.

331
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,360
They say it'll collapse soon.

332
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,750
Which is why we're going to demolish it.

333
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:59,730
Meaning... nobody will know that you're underneath here.

334
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,980
What do you think of this method?

335
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:08,810
It must be scary though... to be breathing when you know you're about to die.

336
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,620
It's all over.

337
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,740
I'm going to flee immediately.

338
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,860
Going to flee immediately.

339
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,030
Hey, get things ready for me.

340
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,190
Where are you going to go?

341
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,800
W-What are you saying? I have to go to my family, of course.

342
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,720
Will you be okay?

343
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,770
- W-What are you saying? 
 - Park Seung Seon is dead.

344
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:48,400
I don't know what country it was, but as soon as he landed at the airport,

345
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,020
he died of an accident.

346
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,510
Hey, hold him tight.

347
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,340
Stay still! Stay still, I said!

348
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:30,650
354-NU-6689.

349
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,220
Yes, hello?

350
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,990
I'd like information on the car owner of license plate 354-NU-6689.

351
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:45,470
He was after that car.

352
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:48,860
There was a reason Min Woo Cheon ran away. That's where we'll find the answer.

353
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,420
You're suspended!

354
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,100
Don't you understand the situation?

355
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,910
You're being strange.

356
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:02,580
- How so? 
 - You seem especially emotional about this case.

357
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,490
I wonder what got you hooked. Is it Pyo In Sook?

358
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,360
You know yourself, that it's not because of Pyo In Sook.

359
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,480
Have you looked into it?

360
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,160
Who?

361
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,710
Koo Ji Pyo?

362
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:20,580
You mean, LE Group's Koo Ji Pyo?

363
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,530
 Don't go, Sis! I'm scared!

364
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:36,430
 Sis!

365
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,730
 Don't go!!

366
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:41,030
 Sis!

367
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,810
 I couldn't see it again.

368
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,810
I heard Mi Do exposed her.

369
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:09,780
Was it really In Sook who did it?

370
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:12,530
I'm sure the three of them went out together that day. I saw it myself.

371
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,490
Not Park Doo Jin though.

372
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,720
She was definitely with Woo Cheon in the room.

373
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,610
- But Woo Cheon ran away. So you never know. 
 - Gosh.

374
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:24,330
She wanted to save herself. She's going to die anyway.

375
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:27,940
- I didn't think she'd do something like that. 
 - Me neither.

376
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,830
 Isn't she Mi Do?

377
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,140
 She is.

378
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,490
 That little brat apparently killed her little brother.

379
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:39,510
 That's right. They went to go save her but her brother died while she lived.

380
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:42,170
 - No way. 
 - Really.

381
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,090
I keep having the same dream these days.

382
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:22,690
Mi Woong is in it.

383
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:29,410
He's calling for me, but I can't look back.

384
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:35,430
When I'm finally able to look back, I wake up.

385
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,860
Mi Woong?

386
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,440
My little brother.

387
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,630
He's dead.

388
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,760
 Don't go, Sis.

389
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,900
 Let's just look at that.

390
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,250
 Sis.

391
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,330
 All right. I'll be right back!

392
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:53,760
 Sis! Don't go, Sis!

393
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,530
 I'm scared, Sis!

394
00:27:56,530 --> 00:28:03,620
 Why did I go to the sea to look at the fireflies that day?

395
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,460
 If I hadn't gone...

396
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,890
 Sis!

397
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,650
 If I hadn't gone...

398
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:12,090
 Where are you, Sis?

399
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,970
 Mi Woong! Mi Woong!

400
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:27,660
 Mi Woong! Mi Woong!

401
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,310
 Mi Woong!

402
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:32,370
 Mi Woong! Where are you?

403
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,020
 Mi Woong!

404
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,150
He was worried I'd be in danger.

405
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:47,650
So he followed after me. But I was unable to save him.

406
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,760
I basically killed him.

407
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:54,830
The way he last looked at me...

408
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,390
I can't forget it.

409
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:05,080
Was it resentment or sadness?

410
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,490
I don't know.

411
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:14,370
It changes every time I think about it. Sometimes it comforts me as if he understands.

412
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:20,240
Sometimes, he glares at me as if he's mad.

413
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,430
I shouldn't have gone there.

414
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,780
I regretted it so much every day.

415
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,400
But...

416
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:36,010
it may not have been because he died...

417
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:41,050
but because I wanted to be loved.

418
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:44,840
 Mi Woong is dead. It was an accident!

419
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,910
 No! It's because of Mi Do. She killed him.

420
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:51,960
 Mi Do is our child, too. She's your child!

421
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,390
 - Until when are you going to blame her?  
 - After Mi Woong died...

422
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:58,120
I had to live while enduring my parents' resentment.

423
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,120
I walked on eggshells, every single day.

424
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,840
 Honey, please!

425
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,470
 What do we do?

426
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,300
I can't smile.

427
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,040
I can't cry either.

428
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,190
I wanted to be loved.

429
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:25,790
That's why I fled to Seoul by myself, earned money,

430
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:29,410
and paid back my parents' debt, too.

431
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,170
I don't know where they are now.

432
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:41,140
No matter how much I let them know about my life through social media... they don't come.

433
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:45,340
Even when I'm dying.

434
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,820
But...

435
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:59,350
since I was the one who got Mi Woong killed,

436
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,610
I may have always been a bad kid.

437
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:18,470
If it's a bad thing to want to live, no one in this world would be a good person.

438
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,190
I'm sorry.

439
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,010
I'm sorry.

440
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:30,830
What are you going to do now?

441
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:34,790
I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

442
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,940
What are you going to do?

443
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:42,560
I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

444
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,950
It's okay.

445
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,760

446
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,100
I wonder why he's chasing Koo Ji Pyo?

447
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,940
There's an abandoned building owned by LE Group around there.

448
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,820
Prepare for a public summons today.

449
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,320
Put him in the photo line and carry out a spot inspection.

450
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,680
About Min Woo Cheon...

451
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,780
Don't talk!

452
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:32,310
Hey! Why are you here?

453
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,500
You didn't piss off yet?

454
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,510
I told you, I have to see Se Yeon.

455
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:47,130
You can just talk to me now.

456
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,540
I can't even meet her?

457
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:51,490
 - She doesn't wish to meet you. 
 - Se Yeon  doesn't?

458
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:53,680
 I'll be direct with you.

459
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,000
 How much are you thinking of regarding the division of your assets?

460
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,580
 I'm not going to get a divorce.

461
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:02,650
If we get a divorce now, it'll end with only me becoming the bad guy when I did nothing wrong.

462
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,470
You visited your wife merely once since she was admitted into the hospice.

463
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:12,130
Your wife who wasn't well due to her miscarriage, took care of your sick mother all by herself.

464
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:16,210
Now that responsibility of taking care of your sick mother has been tossed over to your mother-in-law, isn't that right?

465
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:21,300
On top of that, you took your mother-in-law's lease money.

466
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,650
I was out earning money though. What about me?

467
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:28,920
I worked my butt off kissing up to others!

468
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,750
You must know because you're a lawyer. How can this be a reason for divorce? It can't be.

469
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:36,670
Are you not agreeing to the divorce because of the dividing of assets?

470
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:39,760
It's because I love her! I love Se Yeon!

471
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,500
 I really have no idea why she's talking about divorce all of a sudden.

472
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:47,320
We had no issues until now. I don't understand why she's suddenly doing this.

473
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,930
The lease money? I put it in our savings. I'll return it to my mother-in-law.

474
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:55,270
My mother is going to be admitted into a hospital anyways. Will that work?

475
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,100
My thought...

476
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:04,390
was it would've been better economically to live together rather than my mother-in-law live by herself.

477
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:07,560
 I understand she's worried about her mother who will be left alone.

478
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:12,970
It's not my duty to give money to my mother-in-law after my wife dies.

479
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:15,320
That's up to one's ethics.

480
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:22,800
Your wife doesn't love you.

481
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,360
 - What? 
 - Your wife is terminally ill.

482
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:31,110
She's awaiting death. She wants to be free of you before death.

483
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,190
 She thinks her marriage life was an empty shell.

484
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:37,130
 She thinks it wasn't the life she wanted.

485
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:42,040
 She wants to face death solely as herself.

486
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:45,280
Seriously, w-what are you saying?

487
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,500
You'll be sent a subpoena for mediation of dates.

488
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,580
If a date isn't established, it'll lead to court or judgment.

489
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,010
It means we'll start the process of a lawsuit.

490
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:57,620
It'll be wise for you to get a lawyer.

491
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,590
Excuse me?

492
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,750
Haven't we seen each other from somewhere?

493
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,990
I'm sorry. All right.

494
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,840
She won't meet me!

495
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,660
Yes. A divorce won't happen even if we carry this on, right?

496
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,590
The name of her lawyer...

497
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:31,420
It's Ji Yoon Seo? She seemed strangely familiar.

498
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,530
Is she someone famous? Is she on TV?

499
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,400
Hold on a minute.

500
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:44,200
 - What are you looking at? 
 - Oh, you're awake.

501
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:03,460
That's what I thought.

502
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,720
I thought so.

503
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,190

504
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,060

505
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,460
Mi Do.

506
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,590
Oppa.

507
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:17,010
I'm sorry, I've had a lot going on lately.

508
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:23,280
It's alright. You were really shocked, right?

509
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,320
I already knew, but my father...

510
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,730
What did he say?

511
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:31,590
He thinks we should wait until things are sorted out.

512
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:35,810
He's saying we should push back our wedding announcement and speed up the transfer of succession instead.

513
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,990
It's all right. Don't worry too much.

514
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:45,290
Everything will work out fine. I thought you said she turned herself in?

515
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:47,240
I...

516
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:51,380
I lied.

517
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,800
Lied about what?

518
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,750
I just did as In Sook told me to.

519
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,950
But she ended up becoming a serial killer.

520
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:09,120
Whatever the case, you didn't commit the murder.

521
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,010
She's probably the only one who knows the truth.

522
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:16,860
Things need to get sorted out quickly so that you... I mean, so we can be happy.

523
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:19,880
Let's just think about ourselves, okay?

524
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:23,000
For me...

525
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,830
I hope you can think that you did it for me.

526
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,660
I love you.

527
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,440
Where is Woo Cheon?

528
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:01,890
It's all over. So don't mess with Woo Cheon.

529
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:06,590
- You should've confessed earlier then. If you did— 
 - What?

530
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:10,590
That's right. It's over now.

531
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,900
What are you saying?

532
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,820
I said, what are you saying!

533
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:49,730
What have you done? Woo Cheon...

534
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:07,190

535
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:40,100
I heard Pyo In Sook doesn't have much time.

536
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,360
It'll be difficult to carry out a spot inspection at this point.

537
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,770
Is she just screwing with us?

538
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:48,310
She's unconscious. I think she has to go to the emergency room.

539
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:52,290
The timing of it though! It's strange.

540
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:57,200
Even if we have to push the spot inspection back, check to see if she's well enough to stand in a photo line.

541
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,450
What was that? Did you just sigh?

542
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,280
No, Ma'am.

543
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,700
- Yes? 
 - The LE Group building where the hospice car was at...

544
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:20,320
They demolished it today. Everything is destroyed.

545
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:34,080

546
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:29,830
I-I'm sorry.

547
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:31,640
Why did you come back?

548
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,290
T-To save you.

549
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:39,180
Since we're all going to die anyway, I thought that I might as well save you.

550
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,800
Did you backup the video from the phone?

551
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:46,260
Woo Cheon... Let's stop, please.

552
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,560
The Guseong Gang

553
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:51,250
is under the impression that I killed Park Seung Seon and is coming for me. Th-This is...

554
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:54,990
all Koo Ji Pyo's doing. In the end, he'll kill us all.

555
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:57,130
So that things are clean.

556
00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:01,490
We've always done that up until now, there's nothing more that we can do.

557
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:04,930
Things like truth and revenge don't mean anything.

558
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:10,220
Woo Cheon, let's just run away. You said that you wanted to leave, too.

559
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:15,620
- I have to protect In Sook. 
 - All right, in that case...

560
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:18,350
take her too. You said so yourself.

561
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:22,900
That you need time, that time was the most important.

562
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:27,280
Let's run away, please.

563
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,200
- Yes? 
 - Pyo In Sook collapsed and is now being transferred to the emergency room.

564
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,400
I'll head over there.

565
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,990

566
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:44,870
What happened to her, all of a sudden?

567
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:48,760
As her brain tumor grows, her brain pressure is rising.

568
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:53,060
As it grows, the tumor itself may press on the brain stem,

569
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:56,850
or if the brain stem is crushed due to the increase in brain pressure,

570
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:58,910
she can fall into a comatose state.

571
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:02,130
If it's severe, she may experience respiratory or cardiac arrest.

572
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:04,750
- As for the details... 
 - Is it possible...

573
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:09,250
for me to die suddenly, too?

574
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:12,290
Ah, you're awake? Wait a moment.

575
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,400
Ms. Pyo In Sook.

576
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,530
Why is Min Woo Cheon chasing Koo Ji Pyo? You know, don't you?

577
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:29,700
Woo Cheon... Where is he now?

578
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,290
No... is Woo Cheon alive?

579
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:35,320
What are you talking about?

580
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,870
I'm asking if Woo Cheon is alive.

581
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:40,040
Who is trying to kill Min Woo Cheon?

582
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,020
You must speak, Pyo In Sook. There is no time.

583
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,300
If things come to a crime scene investigation, that will be the end of it.

584
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:51,900
How will you explain killing Park Doo Jin?

585
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:58,700
Pyo In Sook! Hey! Doctor, it's patient Pyo In Sook!

586
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:09,770
What did they say happened?

587
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:13,280
She woke up, but due to the painkillers and medication

588
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,330
she seems to keep waking and falling back asleep. They said that they need to watch her for a bit longer.

589
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:19,470
Even so, that's a relief.

590
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:23,370
I was scared to death, wondering if something went wrong.

591
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:25,530
She'll be okay.

592
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:33,420
Let's split up here.

593
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,420
There's no time, think it over well.

594
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:40,280
I'll make preparations.

595
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:56,750

596
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:03,880
 Where... do I have to go?

597
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:09,330
 If I die like this,

598
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:12,350
 will I be able to meet you?

599
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,870
 Or do I need to be persistent and wake up

600
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:21,860
 in order to see you?

601
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,930
 Where are you?

602
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,890
 Tell me.

603
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:34,010
 I'll go, wherever it is.

604
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:43,400
♫   To you, who got bigger, I hope this   ♫

605
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:51,400
♫   Stay with me, for just a little longer   ♫

606
00:46:51,400 --> 00:47:00,110
♫   Hug me, stay by my side   ♫

607
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,360
Why do you always pack food to bring?

608
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,790
She's laying down and can't even eat.

609
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:31,440
I should give it to her if she wakes up suddenly and wants to eat.

610
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,600
Mom,

611
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,510
In Sook must be getting revenge on me.

612
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:38,830
Why would she want to get revenge over something as trivial as you?

613
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:41,990
She has never felt sick at heart in her whole life, but at the last minute

614
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:47,000
she dropped a bomb like that.

615
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,840
Does she have the time to feel sick at heart?

616
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,370
She would have had to see your face in order to feel that.

617
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,980
And what do you mean at the last minute?

618
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:57,560
I don't know what anything is right now!

619
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,590
It still doesn't feel real that In Sook is dying.

620
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:03,740
What's the deal with the murder? What is going on?

621
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:06,100
This is something that never happens to others, why...

622
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:09,550
Stuff that doesn't happen to me happens to others.

623
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:11,870
That's just how things are.

624
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:17,650
I... put up my store for sale.

625
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:21,920
I wanted to buy a house with that money, and live there with you and In Sook.

626
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,990
Whatever it takes, all of the things that I wasn't able to do for you all that time,

627
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:29,520
I was going to do that.

628
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,000
If In Sook dies like this...

629
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,180
Be quiet! Why would she die?

630
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:38,330
I will never be able to send her off like this.

631
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,730
Grandma...

632
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:14,200
You're up?

633
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:18,820
Are you hungry?

634
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:22,860
I brought your favorite tteokbokki.

635
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:30,150
- What about Woo Cheon? 
 - Huh?

636
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:34,600
Where is Woo Cheon?

637
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,310
Did he not come?

638
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:51,940
Three hours have passed. Carry on without setbacks.

639
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:55,150
Wouldn't it be a bit much to do an open summons?

640
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:59,960
We need to wrap this up before she collapses again. It's already been a few days.

641
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,690
Do we have to say that after waiting indefinitely,

642
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:05,520
the serial killer died from a chronic illness?

643
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,610
I'll take her away.

644
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:09,590
She just woke up, where are you going to take her?

645
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,080
On top of that, if she collapses again, what are you going to do about it?

646
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,540
In that case, we will end the open summons procedure, and return her to the hosp–

647
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:15,070
I said that you can't!

648
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:17,770
She just died and came back to life.

649
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:19,620
What are you going to do if she goes there and gets shocked?

650
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:23,330
- Isn't this a human rights violation? 
 - Sir.

651
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:26,540
This is a serial murder case.

652
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:31,100
Is it true that In Sook killed them?

653
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,450
- She confessed herself. 
 - No!

654
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:36,040
So, why her?

655
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:39,800
Why would she kill someone? Something must have gone wrong.

656
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,920
I didn't raise my child like–

657
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,820
I mean, I didn't raise her...

658
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:48,720
But she's really a nice person! I guarantee you!

659
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:52,380
No, listen...

660
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,560
Hello, Mother, I'll take her myself.

661
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,170
We'll be making a trip to the examination room.

662
00:50:56,170 --> 00:51:00,810
- Let's just get the open summons over with– 
 - Let her get her examination!

663
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:04,380
Where is that detective?

664
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:07,130
He has stepped out of the investigation.

665
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:10,280
- Hey, In Sook's grandmother!  In Sook's grandmother! 
 - Wait.

666
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,680
Just let her get examined.

667
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,070
- She will go after getting the examination! 
 - Sir, this is an obstruction of justice.

668
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:17,880
Why do you keep saying official duty?

669
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,390
I wasn't a bright person since I was a kid, so I don't know anything about official duties.

670
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:23,710
You can't go!

671
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:48,270
I'm going to go to the bathroom real quick,

672
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:51,400
so stay here.

673
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,240
Don't worry. Don't worry about anything.

674
00:51:55,240 --> 00:52:01,180
All you need to do is eat and sleep well.

675
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,910
Who are you?

676
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,850
What's happening?

677
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:58,080

678
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,130
You were alive?

679
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:34,740
You're alive right now, right?

680
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:38,360
I'm sorry.

681
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:41,760
Did you consider that if you go without saying anything,

682
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:48,000
you might never be able to see me again?

683
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,210
I'm sorry.

684
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:51,900
Did you forget that I'm dying?

685
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:56,990
Did you forget that something could happen to me at any time?

686
00:53:57,590 --> 00:54:02,020
What were you going to do if things ended like that?

687
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,970
I'm sorry.

688
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,530
I'm sorry...

689
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:14,400
Are you okay?

690
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,320
Wait a second.

691
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:22,200
 Just tell me one thing. It wasn't you guys, was it?

692
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,890
 Something went wrong, right?

693
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:30,070
 Can't you just tell the police the truth?

694
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:33,040
 I just want to be with In Sook...

695
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:36,310
 She keeps falling asleep and waking up like that.

696
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:40,270
 How could I send her off, knowing what will happen?

697
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:44,370
 I can't do that. How could I send her off in that state?

698
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:46,630
 Please let us be together.

699
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:49,100
 I'll protect her from my side.

700
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,760
 I want to be with her.

701
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:28,670
I had a conception dream.

702
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:32,000
- A golden serpent– you know serpents, right? 
 - Yes.

703
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
A serpent bit my arm like this.

704
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,470
It was a dream, but it hurt quite a bit.

705
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:42,810
After waking up from that, I thought that it was abnormal,

706
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:47,750
so I bought a hamburger and was given a coupon.

707
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:50,900
When I scratched the coupon with a coin,

708
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,420
two hamburgers just–

709
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:56,660
So, I thought, that's all?

710
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:59,620
But the hamburger grew little by little,

711
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:01,090
and turned into a person's face.

712
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:05,290
I had never seen such a beautiful woman's face.

713
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:08,110
- She disappeared. 
 - What?

714
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:11,110
I went to the bathroom for a little while,

715
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:13,870
and she was gone when I came back.

716
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,350
Hey.

717
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:23,280
- Please show me the surveillance camera around the first-floor bathroom. 
 - Yes, one second, please.

718
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:26,190
Here it is.

719
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:29,410
The main entrance.

720
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:35,900
Zoom into the black motorcycle's license plate. Stop, stop, stop. Yes.

721
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,860
Dammit! There's no license plate.

722
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:42,910
Hello? Yes, the black motorcycle doesn't have a license plate.

723
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:48,200
I'm at the hospital, and we need to strengthen the inspection and need to search, so please ask for support.

724
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:07,860
It hurts.

725
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:10,490
- Are you okay? 
 - Yeah.

726
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:13,100
Can you walk?

727
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:24,430
 Why is it getting delayed?

728
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,820
What is going on here?

729
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:31,870
Time has gone by, aren't you dragging this out a bit long?

730
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:35,500
 What is going on?

731
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:38,360
 What's happening?

732
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:45,910
Today's personal information reveal has been postponed due to the suspect's poor health.

733
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:48,000
What are you saying, all of a sudden?

734
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,940
This is a serial murder case. Please be clear!

735
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:52,860
Please speak properly. Did she really die or something?

736
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:56,160
 Please say something.

737
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:59,760
- Where are we going. 
 - Just follow me, for now.

738
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:27,340
- Are you okay? 
 - It's too loud.

739
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:34,150
All of the world's sounds... are too loud.

740
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:46,350
Let's not listen to anything.

741
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,930
Let's just look at each other.

742
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:59,520
While I've had my eyes closed, I kept thinking it over.

743
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,990
Whether you died or lived...

744
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:08,030
Whether I should also die like that...

745
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:11,270
Whether I should wake up again...

746
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:13,700
I kept contemplating it.

747
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,800
When I die,

748
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,830
what scene will I remember?

749
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:22,580
I was really curious about that.

750
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,720
But I figured it out.

751
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:29,130
At the moment when death was right in front of my nose,

752
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:33,740
I thought of you.

753
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:41,650

754
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:43,880
I love you.

755
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:48,600
Now that I think of it,

756
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:51,990
I wasn't able to say that.

757
01:00:55,450 --> 01:00:57,920
I love you.

758
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:04,530
♫   It won't take long now   ♫

759
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:11,570
♫  The day this pain will end  ♫

760
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:17,670
♫  Won't you look back on yesterday  ♫

761
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:25,380
♫  Covered in a long night, I live today again  ♫

762
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:31,330
♫  A long night  ♫

763
01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:39,010
♫  If everything passes and disappears, will it be erased, then?  ♫

764
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:45,100
♫  In memory  ♫

765
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:52,810
♫  if you're smiling, I'm Happy End  ♫

766
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:58,520

♫  A long night  ♫

767
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:01,710
 I waited for you, since there was nothing that I could do but wait.

768
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:04,380
 My child, who I don't know what will become of her at any time,

769
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:05,750
 is smiling.

770
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:07,580
 Will we not see each other again?

771
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:08,460
 Let's meet again.

772
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:10,530
 Make a wanted notice for a serial killer

773
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:13,230
 -  and a contractor for the murder. 
 - What? Min Woo Cheon came by?

774
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:14,660
 I don't understand you anymore.

775
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:16,200
 Why are you asking Oppa that?

776
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,500
 I thought that he might be connected to the murder.

777
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:21,730
 I guess I really don't have time, now. My body won't listen to me.

778
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:23,910
 - What kind of relationship did the two of you have? 
 - A loving one.

779
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:26,580
 This is the end that In Sook wants.

780
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:28,930
 I thought that I might not be afraid if I was with you.

781
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:32,720
  - I won't go anywhere. 
 - Will I be able to see another Spring?
