1
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:12,010
Since my life is like this white paper, this is all I have to write.

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,300

(T/N: In Korean, hello and bye are the same short form, "Annyeong")

3
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,900
There are two kinds of greetings. Bye...

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,850
and...

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,140

6
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,930
hello?

7
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,920
 Separation could be a beginning to new meetings,

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,110
 or perhaps separation is necessary in order for new meetings to exist.

9
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,330
 There are banal sayings like that.

10
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:51,750
 Sure, it may be that, if my mom hadn't left in that way...

11
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,760
 Just let me say goodbye, just a goodbye!

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,750
 ...then I wouldn't have been so stubborn that day. 
 - Hey, where are you going!

13
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,680
 I wouldn't have gotten out of the car,

14
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,030
 and I wouldn't have been able to hear that sound.

15
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,350
 If things went that way, I wouldn't have been able to grab that dying child's hand,

16
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,360
 and that child

17
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,220
 would have left this world.

18
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,390
 Now, the time has come for me to say goodbye again.

19
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,610
 Will I be able to do well, this time?

20
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,290

21
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,810
What happens if I have this?

22
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,040
- Why do you have this? 
 - I'm asking, what can I do if I have this?

23
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,310

24
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:11,320
I have this phone, so it would be best for you to not mess with anyone.

25
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,950

26
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,660
It will be tracked.

27
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,410
But the police are here right now...

28
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,710
What are we going to do? Where do we hide it?

29
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,720
On that evening, do you remember the whereabouts of your roommate, Pyo In Sook?

30
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,860
After the visitation, I took my sleeping pills and fell asleep. I don't remember anything.

31
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,930
Ah, around that time, I was struggling with a sleepwalking condition.

32
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,820
- Sleepwalking? 
 - Yes.

33
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,070
I found out about it later, as well.

34
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,570
- When did you come to find out about it? 
 - After that day.

35
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,630
That day?

36
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,880
Yes... After the visitation day.

37
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,040
Why was it the day after that? Did something happen that day?

38
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,020
Did your symptoms start on that day?

39
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:07,670
No, I had already been walking around the hospice for a while.

40
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:11,050
In Sook saw me on the first day she came to the hospice,

41
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:16,630
but since I can't remember anything... she said she thought it was strange.

42
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,410
Excuse me.

43
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,400
- Yes. 
  - The phone signal turned on.

44
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,160
The hospice is within the 1-2 kilometer radius. Morning Light.

45
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:44,880

46
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,410
Let me trouble you for a moment.

47
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,360
I think you are already doing so.

48
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,640
May I have a look at your bag?

49
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,130
You're going to keep going?

50
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,350
What is the matter here?

51
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,940
There's a possibility that important evidence is inside of the hospice, so I'm in the middle of a search.

52
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,490
Do you mind if I search you for a moment?

53
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,390
Don't you need a search warrant or something?

54
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,620
A primary suspect is right here.

55
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,820
Didn't you say he was a witness?

56
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,100
What?

57
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,690
Why the police?

58
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,790
A-Are they looking for me, too?

59
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,520
Y-Yeah okay, I got it. I'm bringing back something tasty.

60
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,340
Are they reporters? Why have they been like that all day? Living like that must suck.

61
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,260
Hey, I think I might have to leave.

62
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,290
Let's go together, I'll take you.

63
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,460
When people are waiting like that?

64
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:42,140
They've been over there all day, we might as well let them take a photo.

65
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,680
Let's go.

66
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:51,620
- That person who called earlier, 1, are they the person on top? 
 - Yeah.

67
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,510
Who might that be?

68
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,780
We'll have to find that out.

69
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:00,630
As long as we have the phone, they won't be able to rashly go after your grandmother.

70
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:06,090
I have to find out what kind of guy he is, and what's inside of that phone.

71
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,950
But if that person gets caught, you get caught too.

72
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,860
Since you're the one who took murder commissions.

73
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,100
- I don't care about that. 
 - I care.

74
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,940
But what exactly are you basing your confidence on?

75
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,720
Would a nun help you do something bad?

76
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,300
- How far have things progressed? 
 - Oh, my heart.

77
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,420
- What is going on here? 
 - Has a whole army showed up?

78
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,090
This is crazy.

79
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:44,460
All right, everyone! Please head to your rooms and wait. Please actively cooperate with the investigation.

80
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,350
I mean, we have to know what's going on in order to cooperate!

81
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,150
If the police swarm in like that– Oh! I'm so afraid!

82
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,510
I heard earlier that this has to do with the moss rose flower murder case!

83
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:58,520
What? Murder? Who did?

84
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,910
Did Woo Cheon? Wait!  Didn't they say something about coming to investigate In Sook?

85
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,430
No, no. They are witnesses.

86
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,840
- But why are they witnesses? 
 - Why?

87
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,090
- You're stuttering right now. 
 - You know something, but you won't tell us!

88
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:13,200
I understand! I understand. Wait a moment. Wait just a moment.

89
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,060
There's a secret. There's a secret.

90
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,730
Well, as the patients are very disturbed,

91
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,080
you may need to explain the extent of the situation just a bit.

92
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,280
If you could just tell me a little about what you are looking for...

93
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,990
The details of the investigation are confidential.

94
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,220
What is confidential?

95
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,010
I heard everything you were talking about over there!

96
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:38,320
The moss rose murder case happened nearby In Sook's house,

97
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,030
and Woo Cheon was in the vicinity on that day.

98
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,470
Wait a second! Why was Woo Cheon nearby In Sook's house?

99
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,230
Since when have they known each other?

100
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,780
- She said they didn't know each other yet. 
 - How would you know that?

101
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,720
The dead man's daughter is my friend.

102
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,790
- Did that kid come here? 
 - Yes.

103
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,760
- She came to see In Sook. 
 - Is that right?

104
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,810
- So that means that she knew she was here. 
 - What?

105
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:09,200
The day of the incident was the hospice's visitation day.

106
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,250
Did anyone here witness Pyo In Sook's whereabouts from that night?

107
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,750
I did! She was in her room.

108
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:20,990
No... that day, didn't you say you saw something?

109
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,150
Th-That day...

110
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,110
That day...

111
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,480
 I saw them.

112
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:52,500
Oh my! It's so loud! That must be Magdalene.

113
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,540
- Did you say you saw three people? 
 - Pardon? I can't hear you!

114
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,630
Did you say you saw three people?

115
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,340
- I'm not sure! 
 - What were they doing?

116
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,040
I think they were on their way back from somewhere.

117
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,620
We went to the club that day.

118
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:19,400
You went to the club, you say? Kang Se Yeong is saying she can't remember anything from that day.

119
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:27,310
Yes, that's how it turned out. We found out she was a sleepwalker when she couldn't remember anything the next day.

120
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:31,060
Ah! I think I posted a photo that day!

121
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,250
Here.

122
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,770
9:15 p.m.

123
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,200
Did you get to the party at that time?

124
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,600
No, I think we went around when the party started. Was it 7:00 p.m?

125
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,090
Is there anyone among the party attendants that can verify that?

126
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,600
Well, a lot of my friends were there,

127
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,070
but since there were so many people, I don't know if they will remember...

128
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,500
My best friend who threw the birthday party is the Public Prosecutor General's daughter.

129
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,290
Her name is Ho Seon!

130
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:13,180
There, there.

131
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:19,140
If we get tangled in at this rate, the blame could shift to us ex-convicts.

132
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:24,460
I went in for drugs. Love and peace. That's a long way from murder.

133
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,920
What about you? What were you in for? Assault?

134
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,350
- Ey... 
 - Adultery?

135
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,410
Don't smile.

136
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:35,990
I'm most curious about our big brother.

137
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,660
Oh, hello! It's nice to meet you.

138
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,030
Nice to meet you.

139
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,640
Yes, hello.

140
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,970
I'm Oh Jin Kyu, who's in charge of the investigation.

141
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,000
You're LE Group's Director Koo Ji Pyo, right?

142
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,010
What is it for? I heard that you don't even have a search warrant.

143
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,820
That's true,

144
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:15,050
but I can't talk about it in detail since it's confidential. It's connected to a big case.

145
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,430
I ask for your understanding. I'm sorry.

146
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,260
Hey!Hey!

147
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,440
- Oppa! 
 - Hey.

148
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,690
It's been a while.

149
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,550
Do you know him?

150
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,260
Yes. Let's do that.

151
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,820
Is it okay if I call you again in a bit? Bye.

152
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,890
- What are you here for? 
 - Please excuse me.

153
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:04,790
Are you searching here too? I'm the only one who uses this room though.

154
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,330
Do you like wine?

155
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:13,320
The wine there are all vintage and since they're old, they smell really good.

156
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,970
You know that smell has the strongest memory trigger, right?

157
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,980
Hey! Why are you here? Isn't it your time to help Noona Young Ji?

158
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,730
- Did you just leave her alone when you were done? 
 - She said you'd be there soon anyway

159
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:29,170
so it's okay for me to leave.

160
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,670
Where are you going?

161
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,080
- Volunteer work. 
 - You can't do that right now.

162
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,920
- I have to go right now. 
 - We're looking for something.

163
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,650
- Or you can just be obedient and give it to us. 
 - It's past the shift rotation time.

164
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,640
- I can't leave the patient by herself. 
 - You can do it later.

165
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,160
- I really have to go. 
 - If you keep doing this, we can take you to the police station.

166
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,500
- I have to go. 
 - Hey, hold on to him.

167
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,490
What's going on? Oh no!

168
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,890
Get him!

169
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,050
- You must like wine, right? 
 - Yes! I love wine!

170
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,010
Just a second.

171
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,130
Director! We've got trouble! Hurry up!

172
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,390
Noona!

173
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:48,380
Noona! Noona! Noona!

174
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,830
- Noona! Open your eyes. 
 - Move.

175
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,100
Noona!

176
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,020
Noona!

177
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,260
Hurry! Go to the doctor's office

178
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,990
- and ask Doctor Jo to come. 
 - I will.

179
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,520
Open your eyes, please!

180
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,960
Noona!

181
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,970
Young Ji.

182
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,960
What should we do?

183
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:28,350
What are you doing? All of us here are dying.

184
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:33,780
If you're going to investigate, do it quietly. Look at this mess you've made. Just go away!

185
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,330
If she dies, I'm suing you.

186
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,660
You people have no sympathy.

187
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,610
Could you do this if it were your own family?

188
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,270
Calm down and head back to your rooms.

189
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:48,470
- Aigoo. 
 - How can they do this?

190
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,430
Why does he have the cellphone?

191
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:04,080
- C-Cellphone? 
 - I see that you didn't know.

192
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:09,200
Just what do you know? It all got twisted like this because you don't know what's going on with the job requested.

193
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,420
However, the higher-ups are always faster than me when it comes to information.

194
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,570
I reported to them that woman is the real killer

195
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,610
but what happens now that he has the cellphone?

196
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:19,180
On top of that, that guy and that woman are in the same hospice.

197
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,060
So what's going on? Are those two on the same side? Why? Since when?

198
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,040
T-They met coin-coincidentally.

199
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,220
Coincidentally?

200
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,930
Coincidentally, huh?

201
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,160
What are you going to do by taking the cellphone? What are you those two planning?

202
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:41,900
I t-think they fell in l-love.

203
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,200
L-L-Love?

204
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,160
What happened?

205
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,190
Are you okay?

206
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,050
I fell.

207
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,840
Without being able to squirm

208
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,060
and just helplessly lying down,

209
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,200
I thought I was going to die like that.

210
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,830
My condition had been really bad these days.

211
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,270
Of course, I was getting myself ready.

212
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,590
If I die like this,

213
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:49,870
I thought I would at least be of help to you.

214
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,110
How could you say that?

215
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:59,390
I liked it.

216
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:04,980
Even if I were to have a chance to live again,

217
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,760
I won't change anything

218
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,830
and live the same life I've lived up to now

219
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:15,670
once more.

220
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,050
Because of Ji Hoo,

221
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,620
because Ji Hoo exists,

222
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,870
for the moment I met her...

223
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,250
For the two of you too,

224
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,730
I think you'll have that kind of moment too.

225
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:50,290
I think we need to talk.

226
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:55,730
I killed him. This is the deceased's cellphone.

227
00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:00,500
So the culprit of the "Moss Rose Case" is you, In Sook?

228
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,320
No. It's me.

229
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,040
- It's you? 
 - No.

230
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:18,230
"Bear one another's burdens," that's what it says in Galatians 6:2-5.

231
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,730
Is that what's going on right now?

232
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:26,840
Anyway, it seems that the truth is in here.

233
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,270
You must not! They will catch the signal.

234
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,340
We didn't kill him.

235
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:42,500
Is that right? Then we can just give this to the police.

236
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,360
It's not that easy. We didn't kill him but the police are zooming in on us.

237
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,760
If there is no information in there, they'll have no choice but to blame it on us.

238
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,830
The world's logic is mostly simple.

239
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:57,830
- The police will come again. 
 - We just need to give this to them then.

240
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:03,570
The police will come anyway so I'll give it to them and turn myself in.

241
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,070
No.

242
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,980
Fine. Do that then.

243
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:19,340
By the way, this is the basement so the phone signal probably won't work.

244
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,760
I have a good feeling about this. It's in the hospice for sure.

245
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:35,410
The most likely suspect is there and we got the signal from there. It all fits

246
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,290
but we don't have any evidence.

247
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,840
Excuse me.

248
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,340
That patient will be okay, right?

249
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,490
They told us not to touch the hospice.

250
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,300
- Said who? 
 - The high-ups.

251
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:00,840
Because we searched without a warrant, there's a lot of talk right now.

252
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,070
If they hear about a patient being in danger, it might create more trouble, too.

253
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,660
Min Woo Cheon doesn't seem to be the suspect

254
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,760
and we even let him go saying he isn't the one.

255
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,730
- He's under investigation without detention. 
 - Either way.

256
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,510
- Is it LE Group? 
 - It could be.

257
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,040
The higher-ups are all somehow connected

258
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,960
- like a bromance. 
 - LE Group sponsors that hospice.

259
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,870
The boyfriend comes and says "Don't touch them!" That must be it.

260
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,940
I'm worried that you're having a lot of exposure these days.

261
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:36,530
All the articles are about you. If you're exposed, people will somehow find fault.

262
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,860
They will want to tear you into pieces. That's a person's mentality.

263
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,930
- They enjoy seeing someone crumble down. 
 - It's all gossip.

264
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:48,730
- It will pass. 
 - Your feelings aren't part of the gossip? 
 - That's right.

265
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,800
- Are you going to get married? 
 - I'm thinking about it.

266
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,570
I'm also thinking.

267
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:01,650
Well, I don't see marriage as a big deal.

268
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:08,690
Since it has come to this, getting married would look better than dating and breaking up with a terminally ill woman.

269
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:12,760
In a world where the rich stir up trouble by getting divorced,

270
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,840
you can cleanly end it with the love story of the century.

271
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:24,030
Look, look, look at that. Is that a crane?'

272
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:27,410
Hey, Makdal, come out. There is a show here.

273
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:32,360
Just look at him, acting so stupidly. They should hire some other people.

274
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:37,930
My goodness! I'm so hungry. Who would be able to stand it? They would leave as soon as they got hired once he starts fussing.

275
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,130
Oh my! My stomach is rumbling.

276
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:47,160
Where are we going for our picnic? Did we decide to vote by majority?

277
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,520
Yeong Ji said she wanted to go to the sea.

278
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,260
I wonder if she'll even be able to go.

279
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,580
Well, it does seem like the crisis has passed.

280
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:01,630
The crisis has to pass because a crisis is our fate.

281
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,780
Did they say that they wanted to go anywhere?

282
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,490
They...

283
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,990
have something off about them.

284
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,100
What are we going to do about the phone?

285
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,220
If they come looking again...

286
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,190
Now they won't be able to come.

287
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:30,200
If something happens to Yeong Ji, we can cover it up by blaming the police for her death...

288
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,400
What? You can talk about someone else's death so easily?

289
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,120
You want us to use that?

290
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,710
Why do you play saint whenever urgent issues arise?

291
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,950
Isn't all of this because of you, anyway? Why did you bring it here?

292
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:45,900
- Since you keep doing things independently– 
 - Yeah, I'm independent.

293
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,680
I committed the crime independently, and I'm going to act independently.

294
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:54,250
At any rate, the police are suspecting me, and if I come out on the DNA examination results, things will be even cleaner.

295
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:58,150
Don't worry, I'm going to end this on my own.

296
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,990
- Where are you going? 
 - What's her deal?

297
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,560
Stop fighting!

298
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:17,490
- Ji Woo. 
 - Yes?

299
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:20,750
- Are you going to school? 
 - Yes.

300
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,780
- Why? 
 - Nothing.

301
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:30,430
You're asking why I'm going to school while my mother is like that, aren't you?

302
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,960
Yeah.

303
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,830
My mom would want me to go to school.

304
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:39,150
I have to live the way I have been, in order for her to feel at peace.

305
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:46,430
Possibly, if there is any chance that

306
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:50,840
she passes away while I'm not here, I will be all right.

307
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,300
Because we have had plenty of time to say goodbye.

308
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,990
I'll be off!

309
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,540
Bye.

310
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,900
Goodbye...

311
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,050

312
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,120
I'm going to turn myself in.

313
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:36,120
- What? 
 - So don't touch my grandmother.

314
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,340
And... give me some time.

315
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,550
There's no time. There's really no time.

316
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:47,160
I'm dying. I'm terminally ill. I have to at least say goodbye.

317
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:52,170
So did you really meet him there for the first time, and become like that?

318
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:57,150
- What are you talking about? 
 - Well, that is...

319
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,280
Falling in love with Baek Gu...

320
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,290
Shut up.

321
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:05,570
I won't be long, I don't have many people to say goodbye to.

322
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,520
That guy has the phone, doesn't he? Hand that over first.

323
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,320
I am going to say goodbye first.

324
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,450
You were here?

325
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,030
Yeah.

326
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,770
Did you stay up all night?

327
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,850
How is Yeong Ji?

328
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,510
She's all right.

329
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,310
That's a relief.

330
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,230
Hurry and go sleep.

331
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,960
Where are you going?

332
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,570
To say goodbye.

333
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:49,760
- Goodbye? 
 - Do you know why dying is sad?

334
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,730
Because of the people left behind.

335
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,710
That's everything.

336
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,520
You said you threw the phone in the trash, but I think someone took it.

337
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,340
Who?

338
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,540
I'm in the middle of figuring that out, but I have one thing to ask you.

339
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,290
All right.

340
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,830
Did you go to the hospice?

341
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,460
How did you know?

342
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,010
Why the hospice?

343
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,360
The phone's signal was caught in that vicinity.

344
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,090
- Are you crazy? 
 - This would be very memorable.

345
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,450
Is that a mourning outfit?

346
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:23,920
 You are so young, why are you always dressing in such drab clothes?

347
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,690
 My insides feel jet-black just looking at you!

348
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:35,850
My grandmother's wish is for me to wear a flower-patterned dress.

349
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:39,060
How is this?

350
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,930
I'll try it on and come out.

351
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:17,890
 Smile a little, I never see you smile.

352
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,970
 I don't even remember the last time you smiled.

353
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,210
She said she wanted to see me smile,

354
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,570
and after that...

355
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:41,690
what was it? Why can't I remember all of a sudden?

356
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,150
There was something else...

357
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,470
To start off...

358
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,990
It doesn't suit you.

359
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:56,530
- It doesn't? 
 - No, not really.

360
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,560
Why have you been like that since before? Why would you follow me and spoil the vibe?

361
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:06,830
Just be the way you are. Things like this don't comfort the people you're leaving.

362
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,510
It will be even sadder to remember things like this.

363
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,370
What's sadder than you making up your mind and saying goodbye?

364
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:15,520
- Then what should I do? 
 - You shouldn't give up!

365
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,850
Don't make it obvious that you gave up by being like this.

366
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,790
Then what should I do?

367
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:23,720
Should I throw a fit, saying that I want to keep living?

368
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,450
That might be better, actually.

369
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:42,580
To be honest, I don't think that I'll die.

370
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:47,410
For some reason, I don't think that I'll die. I can't believe it.

371
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:55,490
I feel like a miracle will happen for once in my life, and some nights I stay up all night hoping for something like that.

372
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:59,590
"Yeah, I am going to live."

373
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,560
So I pushed off telling my grandmother.

374
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:07,780
But that doesn't make any sense.

375
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:12,150
So I have to tell my grandmother goodbye.

376
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,480
Because she needs time to prepare.

377
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:55,470
Grandma, I'm home!

378
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,810
Why?

379
00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:00,370
I mean, is that so surprising?

380
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:03,710
Why did you come? Without even a call?

381
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,070
I wanted to surprise you.

382
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:14,420
How do I look? Pretty?

383
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,580
Yeah, you look pretty.

384
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,710
Why do you keep smiling?

385
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,820
Food! Did you eat?

386
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:29,580
Isn't foreign food covered in grease?

387
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:33,310
I have a lot of your favorite foods.

388
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,080
Come in, come in.

389
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,260
Come in, come and sit down.

390
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:14,000
These aren't leftovers,

391
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,600
I bought them.

392
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:22,660
- Grandma, why would you buy this? 
 - I bought it for you, in case you came.

393
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:26,190
I put in a lot of eggs.

394
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,920
When did you think I would come?

395
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,570
It's jangjorim! 
  (T/N: Soy sauce braised beef)

396
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,660
All right, eat up.

397
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,910
Eat!

398
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:58,640
- It's good! 
 - Eat up.

399
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,690
Eat a lot.

400
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:34,360
You shouldn't mess with the child. What could you get from her?

401
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,600
What brought you here?

402
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,710
In Sook said she was saying goodbye to her grandmother.

403
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,760
Where is the phone?

404
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,720
That came out of nowhere.

405
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,590
Why do you keep asking me that? It's been a while since I turned myself in and got set free.

406
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:03,510
You're still trying to get the phone from me?

407
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:12,350
How should a person facing death say goodbye?

408
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,930
It's better to not do so, isn't it?

409
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:32,250
Every day is the same. When you get old, every day is the same!

410
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,990
But that's all that I wished for.

411
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:39,640
I wished for every day to be the same.

412
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:44,550
Grandma, I'm all right. Okay?

413
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,360
I'm still all right.

414
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:50,440
Why didn't you say anything?

415
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:55,830
Do you think that I would be able to live if I found out after you died?

416
00:34:55,830 --> 00:35:02,200
- That's not it... 
 - Why didn't you say anything? You should have told me first!

417
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:07,290
So that I could do something, anything for you!

418
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,470
- There's nothing. 
 - What?

419
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,660
You already did everything for me.

420
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:20,760
Now you don't have to do anything, Grandma. Okay?

421
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,360
I was just... scared of you knowing.

422
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,960
Because you might be like this.

423
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,320
If you're like this, I can't say anything.

424
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,110
I can't comfort you or say anything nice.

425
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:45,560
- So... 
 - Who asked you to do that?

426
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,460
Did your sickness appear because you didn't eat well?

427
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:03,510
When you were younger, you wanted to eat bananas and cheese so badly, but I didn't buy them for you.

428
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:09,820
I thought that not eating at all would be better than eating only a little, so I didn't buy it for you.

429
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,560
I thought that you would be uselessly getting rid of your appetite.

430
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:17,110
When I couldn't buy you a lot,

431
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:24,560
was it because I made you drink the water that you hated so much?

432
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,520
Was it wrong for me to put everything I saw on TV for healthy water?

433
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,340
Good things in large quantities can become poison.

434
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:37,190
- Grandma, it's not like that. You know it's not like that! 
 - So what caused it?

435
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:41,530
Shouldn't there be a reason? They should at least give you a reason!

436
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:47,940
- What kind of reason? I'm just... I'm just unlucky! 
 - That's what I'm saying!

437
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,360
Why are you unlucky!

438
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,750
How would I know?

439
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,990
Look around! Look at the way things are!

440
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:57,600
I've always been this way with you!

441
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:03,270
Even when I come to say a nice goodbye, you keep saying things that don't make sense!

442
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:08,930
There has to be a reason.

443
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:14,540
Why you? What did you do wrong?

444
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:18,130
Why my child?

445
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:22,620
What is all this?

446
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,530
You've never done anything wrong.

447
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:35,360
You've never committed any sins.

448
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:41,050
Just take me instead! It would be better off that way!

449
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,310
I can't send her away...

450
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:45,550
My child.

451
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,460
Let's go.

452
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,370
You can't do this to me.

453
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:03,190
It's not right to do this to me.

454
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:09,670
I put up with all kinds of dirty things throughout my life,

455
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:14,360
I lived until now without a single complaint.

456
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,830
I never wished for anything much.

457
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:22,830
I never even blamed anyone for my fate.

458
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:27,340
I keep looking back, and I've always been that way.

459
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,920
All I wish for...

460
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,780
there's only one thing that I wish for,

461
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:42,440
and it's that my In Sook could live happily and healthily. That's all I wished for.

462
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:49,940
You can't do this to me!

463
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:54,440
You shouldn't do this to me!

464
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,930
I only wished for one thing!

465
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:07,230
I only wished for my In Sook to live happily and healthily!

466
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:11,600
You can't do this to me!

467
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:28,500
Sometimes I cry while running.

468
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,430
It's pretty difficult, to be honest.

469
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:33,330
I tried doing it ever since I was young,

470
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:37,560
but if I run, tears don't come out.

471
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,590
- Because the tears dry up? 
 - No,

472
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,610
because I'm too busy trying to breathe.

473
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:49,220
You ran like this... ever since you were young?

474
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,290
Yeah.

475
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:58,230
Can you not just cry?

476
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:01,700
- I didn't want to cry. 
 - Why not?

477
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,900
Because there was no one who I wanted to comfort me.

478
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,630
Where are you going?

479
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:20,170
 You went back there?

480
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,600
- You definitely can't get divorced. 
 - Why not?

481
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,900
- Do I have to listen to you until the day I die? 
 - I changed the bank book's name back, too.

482
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,070
- Mom! 
  - Because of that little bit of money,

483
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:34,550
I don't want to hear that my daughter's getting divorced while about to die.

484
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:37,300
- What? 
  - In a little while, your husband will go to pick you up.

485
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:42,230
Since I'll take care of you and your mother-in-law, don't worry, and just come back.

486
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,030
I'm hanging up.

487
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,830
No one can understand what I'm saying.

488
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:55,700
They all think that nothing is wrong,

489
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,200
so they think that I'm the only one with problems.

490
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,060
Knock-knock. Hey,

491
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,200
do you remember the divorce lawyer I told you about?

492
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:12,370
He was my client. Since he had business to attend to nearby, I asked him to come over.

493
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:15,300
- Let's meet with him. 
 - I'm all right.

494
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,780
You're all right?

495
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:20,940
So you are going to leave your mother to live like a maid in that house, and die?

496
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:24,370
- Okay. 
 - No, that's not it...

497
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,340
I plan on trying to talk to my husband again...

498
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:33,800
Hey, it's pretty easy to divorce a guy who's obviously horrible.

499
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,400
It's harder to divorce a guy only slightly bad.

500
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:42,840
I'm not getting mad at you or anything. The lawyer specializes in this; just try and meet him once.

501
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,000
I told him everything I know.

502
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,220
So have a seat, and ask whatever you're curious about.

503
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,070
Lawyer.

504
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:19,990
Has it been twenty years?

505
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:23,530
You haven't changed one bit.

506
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,940
You protected it.

507
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:30,330
- What? 
 - Your face.

508
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:37,140
George Orwell said "Once you turn fifty,

509
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:41,890
one attains a face that speaks of one's value."

510
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:46,930
But in reality, he died when he was forty-six.

511
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,400
Even I don't want to see it.

512
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,500
My face, which speaks of my worth or whatever.

513
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:59,230
Should I call it a relief that I might die before that?

514
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:04,620
Even now, whenever I see myself in the mirror, I get surprised.

515
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:09,540
Is this me? Is this my face?

516
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:13,700
Come to think about it... I was always escaping.

517
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,170
I couldn't protect anything.

518
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:18,560
Since then...

519
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,930
all I did was escape.

520
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,950
So...

521
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,650
Is he my boyfriend?

522
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:14,330
- Yes. 
 - Yes, he is.

523
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:16,700
We've kissed, but haven't slept together yet.

524
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,740
You.. why are you telling me all that?

525
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:21,910
Not... yet?

526
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:23,480
When did Mom die?

527
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,750
Why do you jump around without context in a conversation?

528
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:27,740
Date.

529
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:32,280
February 21st.

530
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,440
It's not far off.

531
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,740
I hope I die on that day.

532
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:41,840
- Hey... what? 
 - It's nice to do it together on the same day.

533
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,460
- Do what? 
 - Ancestral rites.

534
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,310
My mother died in May.

535
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:57,210
I will do it together for you on that day. Live a little longer.

536
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:58,970
Spring is nice.

537
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:02,260
I don't know your mother. Eating together is weird.

538
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,430
- I don't give food. 
 - You should make offerings.

539
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:06,410
- I only light candles. 
 - It has no sincerity.

540
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:08,960
The atmosphere is fine. I light beautiful candles.

541
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,100
Okay then.

542
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:14,340
But still, one beer...?

543
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:19,120
- No need. At least bottled water? 
 - Don't say such things.

544
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,210
Why are you suddenly being like this?

545
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:24,960
I am sorry.

546
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,550
- What for? 
 - I keep getting this thought.

547
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:34,190
Continuously, somehow

548
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:40,150
if I would've lived together with your mom... you and your mom...

549
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,260
if you were together,

550
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:48,170
maybe it wouldn't have turned out like this—

551
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:51,290
If it were that way, I wouldn't have met Woo Cheon.

552
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:59,120
Come to think about it, everything was a chain reaction.

553
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:06,310
If it was that way, then I wouldn't be here with him.

554
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:12,950
So, it's all right. We should just live on.

555
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:18,230
Though I lost one thing, I gained something else.

556
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:21,340
- You should think like this to live comfortably. 
 - Don't act cool.

557
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:24,570
- There's no reason you'd be all right. 
 - I am not trying to act cool.

558
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:28,780
It just doesn't feel real to me.

559
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:32,860
Because I don't know what dying is like.

560
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:41,710
How that approaches you, or what happens...

561
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:45,540
I don't know a thing, so I still feel fine.

562
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:57,840
My father wanted to die along with me.

563
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,960
Because living was hard.

564
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:05,800
He wanted to take me and my mom, but he died alone.

565
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:11,830
But you abandoned your kid to live alone like this.

566
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:18,450
On the wall of In Sook's house, there was a photo of Venice.

567
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:21,540
I had asked her, why is it Venice?

568
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:26,110
When I asked that, she said that her father called it Heaven.

569
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:28,800
Stop it.

570
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,250
That's why I want to go there.

571
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,480

572
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,520

573
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,170
They say around this time is nice.

574
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,970
- How can I go to this place? 
 - By plane.

575
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:48,790
No. Why did you buy this? It's not even a penny or two.

576
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:52,360
I just bought it. I will go there.

577
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:56,780
- With you, together, I will go there somehow. So— 
 - Stop kidding.

578
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:00,710
If you are like this, how would I feel?

579
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,600
Let's go to Venice.

580
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:07,610
- I don't have a ticket for you. 
 - I will buy it.

581
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:13,320
I also want to go, with you. So...

582
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:25,330
Why women other than Pyo In Sook?

583
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:28,540
No. No, no.

584
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:31,650
It doesn't match with Pyo In Sook's DNA.

585
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,150
I am saying it's not Pyo In Sook.

586
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:38,980
- Earlier the components that were detected on the golf club— 
 - Sun cream.

587
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:41,070
It was stuck on the head of the golf club.

588
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:44,630
- I know, I know. 
  - You know, right?

589
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:49,780
 Let me pass by.

590
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:58,810

591
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:01,480

592
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,150
Yes, I had gone on the visiting day.

593
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:11,110
Can I ask you what conversation you had?

594
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:15,990
It was a general visit. That I was sorry

595
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:18,980
for not taking care of her and having her live at the hospice.

596
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:25,310
- It seems like you like golf. 
  - Yes.

597
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,840
I thought I left that there that day.

598
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:32,830
It was there, like that, when I came back home.

599
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:37,320
By any chance, did you bring the golf club to the hospice that day?

600
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:45,410
That... Is my wife related to the murder case somehow?

601
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:47,210
It is her.

602
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:50,350
- She also tried to kill me. 
 - Mom!

603
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:52,070
At night, she entered my room and—

604
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:54,860
tried to choke me.

605
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:58,180
Why is it my Se Yeon?

606
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:02,540
Why? Why are you all like this to her?

607
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,810
I heard you asked the lawyer to take up the case.

608
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:14,540
Yes.

609
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:18,460
But did you already know each other?

610
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:19,680
Yes.

611
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,430
She's a senior from college.

612
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:26,220
Hey, it must be fate. That's good.

613
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,640
Mom.

614
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:04,120
Where was I at this time?

615
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:07,880
You were not there.

616
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:10,130
What?

617
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:13,460
Ten years ago

618
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:19,770
- you were not in this world. 
 - Ahh.

619
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:26,890
- Are you sad? 
 - No, why?

620
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:29,150
It's like that.

621
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:30,940
What?

622
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,590
Dying is...

623
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:38,210
like that.

624
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:44,170
Just not being here...

625
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:47,170
It's like going back

626
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:50,900
to before you were born.

627
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:56,400
It's not sad, right?

628
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:02,080
Yes. It's not sad, Mom.

629
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:57,440
It's weird...

630
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,370
What?

631
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:08,280
I remember that scene.

632
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:14,260
 The first time I went to the sea,

633
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:17,660
 I lost the ring my mom gave me

634
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:21,770
 on the beach.

635
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:25,890
 I searched through the sand for a long time.

636
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:30,670
 I looked and looked.

637
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:36,720
 I don't know how much time passed like that.

638
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:41,810
 Around the time I forgot what I was even looking for,

639
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:45,270
 I stopped and looked up.

640
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:52,540
 The view in front of me was so beautiful.

641
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,120
 It was as if

642
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,170
 my life was that way.

643
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:33,890

644
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:38,060

645
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:08,280
Take care.

646
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,810
Don't be sick anymore.

647
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:51,160
 Hello.

648
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:54,120
 And.

649
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,820
 Bye.

650
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,080
Either way,

651
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:07,410
greetings are not something you can prepare for.

652
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:19,400

653
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:22,860

654
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:26,370
 Though my mom passed away, I think it was a happy ending.

655
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:28,350
 In the video, someone suspected to be Ha's daughter...

656
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:30,760
 What about the wrongs my dad did to me?

657
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,530
 I have evidence that they ordered the murder.

658
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:35,840
 Do you want to team with them and die, or team up with me and live?

659
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,640
 That woman is dying! Why do you have to do this?

660
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,250
 In Sook will never turn herself in because I won't let her do so.

661
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:45,080
 - Let's get married. 
 - I'm scared. I feel like I just started becoming happy...

662
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:49,290
 Let's do it. The most intense thing that a man and a woman can do.
