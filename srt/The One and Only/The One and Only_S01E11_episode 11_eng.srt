1
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,350
Woo Cheon...

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,320
 She's my child but...

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,160
Woo Cheon...

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,890
 I don't know what can or will ever happen to my baby.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,050
 It's not like I want to separate her from me.

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,730
 But she was smiling...

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,380
 She smiled.

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:32,120

9
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,800
 It's an all or nothing situation. Who knows what will happen.

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,890
 I feel like my heart will be so broken

11
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:46,050
 if she dies after being tossed around by the police.

12
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,800
 They have to meet.

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,600
 They are going to have to meet.

14
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,410
This doctor on a show I was watching...

15
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,280
He said he had a patient.

16
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,760
He said that, given the circumstances,

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,150
nothing would be weird even if the patient had already died.

18
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:21,660
But I guess his son was somewhere far away. He said he was waiting for his son.

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:26,020
He insisted on dying only after he had seen his son again.

20
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,550
So he held on.

21
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:31,970
That's how he lived a few more months.

22
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,760
His son came...

23
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:41,730
and he passed away after seeing him.

24
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,520
That's what we call a miracle.

25
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,790
My In Sook is going to wake up.

26
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,880
She's not going to die like this.

27
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:17,950

28
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,740
Don't look at me like that.

29
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,010
I don't know why I'm like this either.

30
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,840
What happened?

31
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,050
What do you mean, "What happened?" We came to save you.

32
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,950
Are you okay?

33
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,610
Me?

34
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,960
I'm done for.

35
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,040
But why...?

36
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,840
I don't know.

37
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,980
 Are you crazy? Does this make sense?

38
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,370
 She is going to run away in this situation?

39
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:29,740
 If we get caught helping In Sook and she runs away, the problem will only get worse!

40
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,810
 Then what will I do?

41
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,440
 If the Moss Flower Serial Murder Case doesn't come to an end, I'll keep getting tied to it.

42
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,770
 No. I can never agree to this.

43
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:42,760
 Her grandma said to take her to Woo Cheon.

44
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,540
Mi Do said she wanted to do it for you.

45
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,580
Did you know?

46
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,220
I've never done anything for someone else.

47
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,820
You know that I always try to get close to anyone who does better than me, right?

48
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:05,410
Even if we were friends, I've never truly done things for them.

49
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,580
That's how messed up I am.

50
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,380
But it is very strange...

51
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,400
why I'm like this with you?

52
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:24,300
You are also my first friend.

53
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,870

54
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,020
Do you think we did the right thing?

55
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,170
What if it's over after we just send her off like this?

56
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:55,160
What we want isn't important.

57
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,900
This is the ending that In Sook wants.

58
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,750
About half a month after sending In Sook to her mom,

59
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,360
I went to see her.

60
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:15,720
And when she saw me, she started picking up her belongings.

61
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,580
She thought I went to pick her up.

62
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,160
That serious kid smiled at me for the first time

63
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,260
and asked imploringly,

64
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,250
"You're picking me up, right?"

65
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,330
But I just left secretly.

66
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:49,440
I keep being reminded of In Sook's face from that time.

67
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,350
She must've waited because you were her dad.

68
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,990
To see when you would come to get her.

69
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,480
Wondering whether her mom would come.

70
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:11,580
So she looked at the calendar every day.

71
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:25,130
I... really did not do anything for In Sook.

72
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:29,110
That's why, if she just dies like this...

73
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,450
Mom... I—

74
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:39,910
My heart... My heart really hurts.

75
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,140
It hurts.

76
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,520
Where are you going?

77
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,260
I don't know.

78
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,720
Will you be fine in that state?

79
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,500
You're sick and you don't know how long you'll have.

80
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,120
- That's why... 
 - What?

81
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,180
That's why I want to be with him.

82
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:50,980
If I'm with him, I don't think I'll be scared.

83
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,350
Take this.

84
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,640
I got this money from marketing my terminal illness in a live broadcast.

85
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,780
It's better off being used by another terminally ill patient.

86
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,240
Thank you.

87
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,600
I'm grateful.

88
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,350
We somehow arrived at this point.

89
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,620
It's all my fault.

90
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,290
Unnie, that's not it.

91
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,800
We only wanted to save a kid.

92
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,950
We saved her. That's enough.

93
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,330
Then, what about us? We're going to die soon.

94
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:09,770
We don't even have much time left. What is all this?

95
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,720
I'll leave now.

96
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,770
Hey! Don't cry.

97
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,270
I hate crying.

98
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,600
Will we never get to meet again?

99
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,990
Let's meet again.

100
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,050
We should meet again.

101
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,730
Again...

102
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:37,280
What is this freaking mess?!

103
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,990
How did a whole crowd of police lose a patient? How did you lose her?

104
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,600
The dying patient who turned herself in disappeared.

105
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,150
We can't use her confession.

106
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,010
And?

107
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,970
It didn't feel right taking her away, no, dragging her away like that.

108
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:53,310
No one is asking you about your feelings right now.

109
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,870
Where are the other women from the hospice?

110
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,710
Sung Mi Do and Kang Se Yeon are not at the hospice. Sung Mi Do's car is moving.

111
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:02,310
- Min Woo Cheon's abandoned bike is near— 
 - Hurry and chase after them!

112
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,210
Roger that.

113
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,700
Hold on.

114
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,880
It's over there.

115
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,190
Got it, Sir!

116
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,460
Let's go.

117
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,890
 In a case like this, it's not too difficult.

118
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,490
In a year...

119
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,280
Sung Mi Do and Kang Se Yeon, I'll be taking the two of you into custody for harboring a criminal and assisting in their escape.

120
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,640
- Is something wrong? 
 - Where is Pyo In Sook?

121
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,840
In Sook? Wasn't she in custody?

122
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,550
Ah... You two, come to the police station for now.

123
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,010
On what grounds are you taking them in?

124
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,530
What are the two of you doing here?

125
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:52,050
As you can see, due to the divorce suit, we are having a scheduled meeting.

126
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,270
I brought her here.

127
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,080
Ah, so you usually give rides...

128
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,030
So, Kang Se Yeon, you came all the way here because of the divorce suit?

129
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,750
Just in time for Pyo In Sook's escape?

130
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,490
That is a reasonable suspicion.

131
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:06,560
But if you can't find evidence before that reasonable suspicion disappears, the crime is not valid.

132
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,920
That's how it's written in article 307 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

133
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,670
Awesome! It wasn't me, but Unnie who was made for it!

134
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,970
Made for crime.

135
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:27,820
Did you call this Lawyer Unnie so that our path of movement would flow a bit more naturally?

136
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,520
But, Unnie, you're totally my style!

137
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,150
You're so cool! I wanted to do something like that, too.

138
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:42,070
You know that kind of thing? Like an expert, know what I mean?

139
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,720
What are you going to do now?

140
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,280
I should go to the hospice.

141
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,020
If the investigators find any evidence–

142
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,540
If that happens, can you defend us?

143
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,690
I mean, I thought it over,

144
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:03,260
and killing Ha Yong Geun was self-defense.

145
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,030
To be honest, we also...

146
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:10,750
well, In Sook killed a psycho!

147
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,370
Well, In Sook didn't kill that Park Du Jin guy,

148
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,370
but there was a possibility that he would commit another crime...

149
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,060
Just because he's a psychopath doesn't make his murder right,

150
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,090
and that kind of thing definitely isn't self-defense either.

151
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:27,740
And what I'm asking about is the criminal acts of both of you.

152
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,780
I see that you're a no-nonsense type.

153
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,180
Where are we going?

154
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,260
You'll see when we get there.

155
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,700
I waited for you.

156
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,860
Since there was nothing else that I could do but wait.

157
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:13,680
 Starting at some time, I had never waited for anyone before.

158
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,370
 I guess I lived that kind of life.

159
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,360
 Without expectations or hope.

160
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,100
 Without waiting.

161
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:36,820
 But as I filled this space,

162
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,440
 while waiting for you, I became aware.

163
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,250
 Waiting is...

164
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,540
 heart fluttering...

165
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,440
 It's a happy thing.

166
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,230
Do you like it?

167
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,050
Yeah.

168
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,910
Come here.

169
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,580
Okay.

170
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,420
I wanted to leave this chair as it is.

171
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,390
Have a seat.

172
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,110
Oh...

173
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,890
Rest.

174
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,230
Rest comfortably.

175
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,020
Okay.

176
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,400
What are you doing?

177
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,280
Why are you standing there?

178
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,470
- Should we step in? 
 - Step into what? 
  - I said, why are you standing next to that woman?

179
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,790
- Tell him to leave. 
 -You're tempting Se Yeon because you're after money, right?

180
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,550
- Oh Young Chan. 
 - Let's have a seat to talk.

181
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,790
I thought it was strange.

182
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:26,340
All of a sudden you were bringing up divorce and a lawyer, I couldn't understand it from a common-sense perspective.

183
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,190
But then I remembered.

184
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:32,490
The sight of you on that night, when you were sitting alone in the living room,

185
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,460
looking at a picture and smiling.

186
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,460
- Stop it. 
 - That was the first time I had seen that expression.

187
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,830
I lived with you for ten years,

188
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,490
but the first time I saw you making that face, was when you were looking at this woman and smiling!

189
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,030
What's your relationship?

190
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,660
Don't make any excuses about being in a senior-junior relationship.

191
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,030
We liked each other.

192
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,750
We met 20 years ago in college as a senior and junior, and came to like each other.

193
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,400
We couldn't meet each other for 20 years...

194
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,520
And we came to meet again by chance through a client.

195
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,870
What makes you so confident?

196
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:09,240
Unnie, just go. Let's talk late–

197
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,960
- Why are you looking at me like that? 
 - Because I feel sorry.

198
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:17,400
- What? 
 - I feel sorry for Se Yeon.

199
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,520
Hey!

200
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,920
Seriously... this is so embarassing.

201
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,100
Yeah, it's embarrassing, isn't it?

202
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:35,810
Now you get how embarrassing what you've done is.

203
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:41,020
No. I'm embarrassed by you.

204
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,510
I'm so embarrassed of the life I lived with a bastard like you for ten years,

205
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:48,630
that I could just die! Do you get it? Do you understand?

206
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,260
Se Yeon! Se Yeon.

207
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,200
 Your call could not be connected, after the beep...

208
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,620

209
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:13,050

210
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,370
 That building owned by LE Group was demolished today. It was all knocked down.

211
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:27,510
 There was a reason that Min Woo Cheon ran away. There will be an answer there.

212
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,520
We blew it. Completely blew it.

213
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,970
Jo Si Yeong disappeared.

214
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:37,000
That guy disappears every other day.

215
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,180
Guseong Gang, Park Seung Seon...

216
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,260
What's up with Seung Seon?

217
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,980
Are you close with Seung Seon?

218
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,170
Well, I wouldn't say "close," but I was in charge of him.

219
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,670
He died.

220
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,780
Why would he die? He– He's not the kind of guy that would die easily.

221
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,720
On the day that Park Du Jin was murdered.

222
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,960
My grandmother prepared it?

223
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,530
Yeah.

224
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,900
It's good.

225
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,570
I want to eat some, too.

226
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,150
It's so good.

227
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:05,190
♫  I will be like a star  ♫

228
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:10,260
♫  I feel your wave, yeah  ♫

229
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:15,490
♫  Inside a tangled maze  ♫

230
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:19,220
♫  I follow the light  ♫

231
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,590
♫  Come find my light  ♫

232
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,950
♫  I'll shine on you, yeah  ♫

233
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,750
This is it.

234
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:35,850
♫  When I open my eyes, still by my side,  ♫

235
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:39,480
♫  You, the one and only  ♫

236
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,230
That's sweet.

237
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:49,920
♫  Star, light, time  ♫

238
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,790
You aren't drunk from drinking this, right?

239
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,290
Anyway, in my dream,

240
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:03,280
I was dancing around on the beach!

241
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,460
So... like this.

242
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:12,320
So people crowded around and they were looking at me.

243
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,360
But the really fascinating thing is, I wasn't embarrassed.

244
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,280
But in the crowd, I spotted you.

245
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:25,300
So I started going towards you, but you ran away!

246
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,150
So I ran for my life trying to catch you.

247
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,430
But you ran into the sea.

248
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,470
I ran into the water too, of course!

249
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:38,180
But... you suddenly disappeared.

250
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,890
So I swam to try and grab you,

251
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,720
but as soon as I thought, "Wait, I can't swim."

252
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,160
I sunk into the water.

253
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,630
As soon as I thought, "This is how I die..."

254
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:55,000
I woke up!

255
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,760
Were you in a lot of pain?

256
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,870
I just kept dreaming.

257
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:08,090
 I looked for you endlessly in my dreams.

258
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,960
But it was so dark that I couldn't see anything.

259
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,520
But far off in the distance,

260
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,680
you turned around to face me.

261
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,820
You were mumbling something.

262
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,520
Right then, subtitles appeared.

263
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,480
What did they say?

264
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,020
It's okay.

265
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,990
Like this.

266
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,620
We...

267
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,740
will be okay, right?

268
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,320
Yeah.

269
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,580
We're together like this.

270
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,550
Yeah.

271
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:01,130
What happened to you, after you disappeared like that?

272
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,900
You met Koo Ji Pyo, right?

273
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,590
I was in the darkness.

274
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,360
I thought, "This must be how I die"...

275
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:17,010
But strangely, I wasn't afraid.

276
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,420
My heart just hurt a little.

277
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,820
Because I couldn't see you.

278
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,300
Because you weren't next to me.

279
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,180
I also thought that it was a relief.

280
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:39,350
That someone came to mind as I died...

281
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:43,620
So that I wasn't lonely...

282
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,060
That I loved someone...

283
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,460
I thought that it was a relief.

284
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,660
That you, one person,

285
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,260
were next to me.

286
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,340
Thank you.

287
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,420
In Sook left well, didn't she?

288
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,210
Yes.

289
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:37,870
I have no idea what happened.

290
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:42,840
Because they said that they didn't do it, I believe that they didn't.

291
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,420
We also believe that.

292
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,000
Are you in pain?

293
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:00,980
This deeply blue place,

294
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,220
how can things be this way?

295
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:10,460
Even when In Sook said cancer,

296
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,030
I would give up my life,

297
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:17,750
so I prayed that that blue child could be left alone.

298
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:22,420
But now that I see the rest of you,

299
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:26,450
I feel so ashamed.

300
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:32,150
We should be sent off in order! What's this mess?

301
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,660
Why am I crying right now?

302
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:47,990
You're always covered in scars,

303
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:53,010
it's because you're tied up in that.

304
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:05,570
Grandma, you are the first one...

305
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,210
First what?

306
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:16,120
The first one to ask me if I'm hurting

307
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,260
and to truly worry about me.

308
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,650
For being friends with my In Sook,

309
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,210
thank you.

310
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:42,890
She was always so tough and didn't smile, so she didn't have any friends.

311
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:46,040
She always looked so empty,

312
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:51,680
and that... broke my heart.

313
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,690
Since the two of you were always with her,

314
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:02,850
I felt so secure.

315
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:10,680
In Sook smiles a lot now.

316
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,580
She's smiling...

317
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,460
I see, she knows how to smile like this.

318
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:03,560
Wait a second. Try enlarging it.

319
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,520
What are they doing? Are they fighting?

320
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:15,610
Excluding the places where Sung Mi Do's vehicle was captured by CCTVs, center investigations on places without CCTVs.

321
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,720
- It's the neighborhood that Min Woo Cheon lived in when he was young. 
 - Understood.

322
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,060
- And track the location of Koo Ji Pyo's vehicle. 
 - All right.

323
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,120
Who?

324
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:30,640
- I was late today. 
  - Really?

325
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,080
- Why? 
 - I must have slept really well for the first time in a while, I slept all the way from 9:00 p.m.

326
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,620
Ah... So that's why you didn't call me yesterday?

327
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,770
Yeah, I'll head to the hospice later.

328
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:43,110
Oh? Really?

329
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,600
I have an important announcement to make.

330
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,250
I slept well.

331
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,550
You're up?

332
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,120
I slept too much, didn't I?

333
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,570
Good job.

334
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:51,050
Hurry and come, let's eat.

335
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,940
It looks good.

336
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,490
When did you prepare all of this?

337
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,650
Eat up.

338
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,750
They say that when foreigners die,

339
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,540
their wish is to die next to someone they love.

340
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,260
But for Koreans, not causing an inconvenience

341
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:52,210
to their family or their children is preferred.

342
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,690
That's true, that's true.

343
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,910
My parents passed early,

344
00:30:55,910 --> 00:31:00,320
and my close friends grew distant after getting married and starting families.

345
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,580
How could it be that ever since I was born, there is not one person

346
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:09,570
who loves me and I love back?

347
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,560
It's a little weird.

348
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,920
I miss my mom.

349
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,270
I nursed my mom for a long time.

350
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:24,490
My mom is dying, but I was also dying right next to her.

351
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:33,880
But one day, I began to think...

352
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,550
it would be nice if my mom died, now.

353
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,890
Everyone is like that in that kind of situation.

354
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:48,040
It's so difficult. But that's not how you really felt then.

355
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,980
But my mom must have gotten revenge on me.

356
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:56,570
When she actually died, I wasn't there.

357
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,340
When I stepped out for a moment,

358
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,340
she passed on.

359
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:12,980
So... after I was diagnosed, I headed straight here.

360
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:20,790
If my daughter were to think like that when I die, it would be so pitiful.

361
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:24,780
Even still, it would be nice if she was next to you when you die, right?

362
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:29,660
Yeah, so that I could just caress her face one time.

363
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,750
What about your son?

364
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:37,430
My son... is in America.

365
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:40,250
Even if your son is in America,

366
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,810
he should come if his mom is sick and dying!

367
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,520
Geez, he doesn't know.

368
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,420
You didn't tell him?

369
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:49,290
So you haven't had contact with him that whole time?

370
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:51,580
I met him once.

371
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,190
He came from far away,

372
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,050
but I could tell just by looking.

373
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:07,210
My husband started a new family, and he thought that his stepmother was his real mom,

374
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:11,880
but he was confused when I appeared so suddenly.

375
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,980
I thought I should let him go.

376
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:20,750
So I said my farewell then.

377
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,920
Even still, you should tell him.

378
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:27,900
He'll be so agitated if he finds out later after you die.

379
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:33,620
Even if he's agitated, death doesn't solve everything.

380
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:39,320
The distance grew for a long time,

381
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:44,770
so to go now, and tell him that his mom is dying, and ask him to be next to me...

382
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,050
I shouldn't do that to my child.

383
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,480
Even then, those, what was it... ever since those Green Ray kids showed up,

384
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,000
this place seems like it actually has people living in it! Right?

385
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,680
Life is a drama, my goodness.

386
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,090
They're doing all kinds of crap!

387
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:09,250
In Sook! Look at how she ran away to be with Woo Cheon in that state! She's so cool.

388
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,850
I mean, one of them is marrying a chaebol,

389
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:14,870
and another is talking about liking women out of nowhere,

390
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:17,650
and one is on the run for being a serial killer!

391
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:22,780
Wow... there's so much variety! I'm having so much fun that I can't die.

392
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,590
- Oppa! 
 - You're alone?

393
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,620
I mean,

394
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,770
what's the important announcement?

395
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:40,350
What is it? What is it?

396
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:43,510
I got the date for our wedding.

397
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,120
How?

398
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,020
I mean... didn't your father say we should look over the situation a bit?

399
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:55,020
She turned herself in and the situation is over.

400
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:59,320
But apparently, they put off the public summons.

401
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,710
Is she really that sick?

402
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:06,400
That is...

403
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,840
What? Is something wrong?

404
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:14,700
- She ran away. 
 - What?

405
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:18,230
Oppa, shhh... Be quiet.

406
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,660
Things ended up that way.

407
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,410
How do things end up that way?

408
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:25,960
Well, it's true that In Sook was in a really bad state,

409
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,450
but she said that she had to see Woo Cheon again...

410
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:33,230
Min Woo Cheon? How would she meet him?

411
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,530
What?

412
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:38,370
I mean, how could he know to meet?

413
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,590
Woo Cheon came to the hospital and grandma secretly–

414
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,520
What did you say?

415
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,710
Why are you so surprised?

416
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:51,710
- So you're saying, Min Woo Cheon came? 
 - Yeah.

417
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:54,140
What's wrong, Oppa?

418
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:01,360
Oppa! Oppa!

419
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,490
What am I supposed to do if you just leave like this?

420
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:06,850
So you helped them?

421
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:09,930
I really don't know why you're being like this.

422
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,700
That's obviously a crime.

423
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,620
No matter how much of a friend she is, why do you keep stepping and helping her commit crimes like that?

424
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,020
They are not the culprits.

425
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,480
- Then who is it? 
 - I don't know!

426
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,720
Anyway, they said that they didn't do it. They said it themselves.

427
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:28,670
Are the police stupid? They're investigating and announcing all of the evidence they find.

428
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,490
I'm sorry.

429
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,520
Forget it...

430
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,590
What is it?

431
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:39,940
Detective?

432
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:44,380
- You know Jo Si Yeong, right? 
 - Didn't Jo Si Yeong get fired?

433
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:48,260
How did you know that? None of the investigators even know that.

434
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,430
Anyway, I am above him. The team leader.

435
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,130
- So? 
 - Before Jo Si Yeong was fired,

436
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,750
he handed over a ton of materials.

437
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,150
You know this man, don't you?

438
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:08,430
No. Who is it?

439
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,850
What are you doing right now?

440
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:23,090
- I'm asking a question. 
 - I mean, why are you asking him that?

441
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:27,410
Because I thought that he might be involved in Park Du Jin's murder.

442
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,560
What?

443
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,890
This person.

444
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:35,630
Okay? Why are you asking my oppa about that right now?

445
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:43,190
I don't know who that is. Did Jo Si Yeong say that I had something to do with it?

446
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:47,970
This person came up in LE Group's bank account records.

447
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:53,010
Did you not know that this place had gang affiliations?

448
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,110
What are you suspecting right now?

449
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,440
It's not suspicion, it's a doubt, for now.

450
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,800
Put aside your unnecessary doubts and catch the criminal.

451
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,090
The criminal ran away, should you be here making wrong guesses?

452
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,990
Oppa!

453
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:22,840
No.

454
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:27,950
No, that's not evidence.

455
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,330
- What's your category, my sister? 
 - Pardon?

456
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:43,650
- Her face complexion screams liver cancer. 
 - Are you planning to come live here?

457
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:48,520
- Of course, she has to. 
 - What stage are you in?

458
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,620
Excuse me, Detective.

459
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,160
What are you talking about earlier?

460
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,910
What are you talking about?!

461
00:38:55,910 --> 00:39:00,300
You can't leave after saying that nonsense without an explanation.

462
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,220

463
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,690
Oh, right! I saw her with In Sook last time.

464
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,880
Let's talk once things make sense.

465
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,040
Sorry?

466
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,580
She can't do that to another person.

467
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,660
Where are you?

468
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,080
The reporters have caught on to it.

469
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,850
 Someone followed you!

470
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:28,630
 We're on the verge of everything being revealed to the entire world. That fact that a murderer ran away

471
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:34,470
 and that the incompetent police tried to hide this by lying that her condition got worse!

472
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:35,680
Catch her right now.

473
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,530
I'll do whatever I can to stop the news from getting out to buy you some time, so go catch her right now!

474
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,080
- What day is it today? 
 - I'm not sure.

475
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:09,460
I saw the calendar somewhere.

476
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:19,190
It's an old calendar.

477
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:25,040
I don't remember spring.

478
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,060
Will I be able to see spring again?

479
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:40,520
I hated cherry blossoms. I hated the same songs they would keep playing from all directions, too.

480
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,220
I didn't like those songs either.

481
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:45,060
There was a park near the public bathhouse,

482
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,010
and there's usually no one there.

483
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:53,890
I rested there by myself. But when the cherry blossoms start to fall,

484
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:59,030
people come to the park and take pictures and laugh.

485
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:02,650
Among the people who are doing something, I put my head down alone.

486
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:06,220
Then I step on the scattered cherry blossoms on the floor.

487
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:09,890
Cherry blossoms fall in a short period of time.

488
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,960
Their petals blowing everywhere.

489
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:20,050
I couldn't handle it.

490
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,460
I think it'll be okay...

491
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,690
if I watch it with you.

492
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:38,770
 They say if you catch the falling cherry blossom flowers, love will come true.

493
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:41,900
 Then, we can catch them together.

494
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:52,500

495
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:05,770

496
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:19,480
Get it together, all of you!

497
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,130
Why are you wasting time? Are you doing this on purpose?!

498
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,660

499
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,290
What's this?

500
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:20,330
Why is this picture all of sudden here? I already erased it.

501
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:24,220
I think the reporter leaked it after the escape article was released.

502
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,560
It's a photo from the day of the incident.

503
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,060
Oh no, what do we do? Our personal information is being exposed.

504
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:37,530
They even found out that In Sook lives around where Ha Young Geun's house was.

505
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:41,400
How did they find out that you were getting a divorce?

506
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:46,320
We live in a world where everyone is somehow connected to each other.

507
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:52,530
They're going crazy, saying we're "headache-inducing terminal patients."

508
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:54,630
Are you going to be okay?

509
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:00,750
- Mi Do is not related to the case. 
 - I think she is related.

510
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:04,850
- Sorry? 
 - That's what people think, anyway, and what they think matters.

511
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:08,930
Everyone's watching now that the culprit has run away.

512
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:13,200
Don't you think we'll have to stop funding the hospice? Now the wedding?

513
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,460
- As planned— 
 - This is an important time.

514
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:18,850
Cut everyone out. Anyone who's associated with the serial killer.

515
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:22,120
- Everything will be under control soon. 
 - Not anymore.

516
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:30,200
We are really alike.

517
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:35,300
But you always told me you were different, you were kind.

518
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,890
Why?

519
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:42,040
- What are you suddenly saying? 
 - Wasn't it because you wished we were different?

520
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:45,220
That's why I tried to seem different.

521
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,830
But I think from all that hiding and repressing,

522
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,090
something may have broken.

523
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:09,730
Woo Cheon. Woo Cheon...

524
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:13,110
Woo Cheon.

525
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,170
Woo Cheon.

526
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,040
Woo Cheon.

527
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,700
Woo Cheon.

528
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:13,230
 I'm going to leave first.

529
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:16,090
 I'll get it ready within four days.

530
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:24,620
 Be careful. Be healthy. Bye.

531
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:27,290
Here.

532
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:28,800
Thank you.

533
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:33,340

534
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:36,370
Where's W-Woo Cheon right now?

535
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:37,760
He's still in that neighborhood.

536
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,810
T-Try to get it ready as soon as possible i-if possible.

537
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:43,820
I'll have to leave while the police are still keeping the escape under wrap.

538
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:47,100
- You going to your family, right? 
 - Yes.

539
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:57,500
Hello, Min-Min Ju.

540
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,170
I will—

541
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:01,620
 Dad, please don't come.

542
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:04,030
 If you come, they will kill us.

543
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,070
What are you talking about?

544
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,660
Am I dead?

545
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,210
Or is this a dream?

546
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:38,670
It's not cherry blossom season yet.

547
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:10,430
- Did you see the cherry blossoms? 
 - What?

548
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,690
Do you want to try catching it?

549
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:29,000
Did you go out to buy this?

550
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:35,400
- Yes, once you woke up— 
 - I told you to stay by my side!

551
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:39,920
You slept for a while, so I just

552
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,700
- stepped out for a minute. 
 - How do you know if I was sleeping or dead?

553
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,580
I don't even know when or how I'll die.

554
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:48,060
What are you talking about?

555
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:57,000
The tumor has gotten bigger.

556
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,410
They say my heart can stop at any second.

557
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:03,430
That's why I asked you to stay by my side.

558
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:08,980
I ran away because I want to stay by your side, so please stay with me!

559
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:14,000
It's fake and I don't like it. I don't like anything.

560
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,660
I'm sorry.

561
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:44,930
I won't go anywhere.

562
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:57,960
You want to stop?

563
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:02,320
- Yes. 
 - Why?

564
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:05,490
- I feel sorry. 
 - For what?

565
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:12,430
I feel like no good will come for you. I don't know what he's capable of when he's that angry.

566
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:17,150
He says he'll do what he can to get over it if I withdraw the divorce suit.

567
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:20,450
Remember what you said, Se Yeon?

568
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:26,360
When I asked why you wanted to get a divorce, you said you just wanted to cut him out.

569
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:29,150
That you wanted to do that before you died.

570
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:36,430
I know that feeling so well. That's why I wanted to help you. I'm just doing my job.

571
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:41,780
I don't want you to go back,

572
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:45,330
and leave you feeling embarrassed and obsequious.

573
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,430
That person...

574
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:52,240
will not leave me alone.

575
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:57,130
Do you want to run away again?

576
00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:02,890
You feel small because you run away. If you want to cut him off, you have to look him directly in the face.

577
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,690
Either in the past or now, we never did anything wrong.

578
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:18,230
Ma'am...

579
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:20,550
you can't do this all of a sudden.

580
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:22,370
I can't stand it anymore.

581
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:26,630
I've seen many patients, but it's never been this tough.

582
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:31,480
She flips the table over every time and is just so vicious. I can't do this anymore.

583
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:36,050
- Can you just wait until I find someone else— 
 - I've waited until now.

584
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:41,610
I shouldn't say this but... it must have been really tough for your wife.

585
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:44,590
I don't know how she did this for years by herself.

586
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:52,140
It seems like your wife's heartfelt caring wasn't unnoticed though. She keeps looking for her.

587
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:57,320
Kang Se Yeon?

588
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:01,540
Where is Se Yeon?

589
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:05,940
She told me she was going to make me abalone porridge. Where did she go?

590
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,820
Did she go to the hospital?

591
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:12,920
- Did she go get IVF treatment? 
 - Mom...

592
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:18,090
- Se Yeon's dying. 
 - What?

593
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:27,250
Se Yeon... is dying.

594
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,620
Do you understand?

595
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,210
 It seems like the Ankylosis is progressing.

596
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:45,900
 It will affect the hands and feet first, but will affect her organs eventually.

597
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:52,460
 I placed a pencil in Mother-in-Law's stiff hands.

598
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:57,990
 She struggled at first, but she didn't give up writing.

599
00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:02,920
 The first thing she wrote was... Kang Se Yeon.

600
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:06,030
 It was my name.

601
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:14,250
 She ate lunch twice today. It seemed like she forgot she had already eaten.

602
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:19,400
 I made her porridge that was easy to digest so that it wouldn't upset her stomach.

603
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:24,820
 After they increased the number of medications, she's experiencing side effects like motor disturbance,

604
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:28,630
 seeing things, amongst others.

605
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:33,520
 I think I'll have to take her to the hospital and get another consultation.

606
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:51,990
I'm sorry.

607
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:56,470
It's okay. I'm the one who made a mistake.

608
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:01,920
If we were dating like regular people,

609
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:08,860
we probably would have fought about small things, broken up, and reconciled. Right?

610
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:14,300
- No. 
 - If we had met that way...

611
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:19,870
- I wonder if you would have kept liking me. 
 - I would.

612
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:22,970
No.

613
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:27,420
You would've been tired of me in no time because of my bad temper.

614
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:33,800
Or you may have just left me. But because you know I'm dying,

615
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,830
we can't do any of that stuff.

616
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:39,330
There's no time to play games with each other,

617
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:43,650
nor can we fight or get upset at each other.

618
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:50,790
We can't cheat on each other and be at each other's throats. We can't do any of that stuff.

619
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,270
Which is why I think...

620
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:57,490
dying sucks.

621
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:59,510
Do you want to do that stuff?

622
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:12,660
To be honest, your temper is really bad.

623
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:17,600
You're brusque and your immediate reaction is to get mad when things don't go your way.

624
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,420
Your nostrils even move separately when you're mad.

625
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:22,770
Also, it hasn't even been that long since we started dating,

626
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:27,620
- but you going to the bathroom with the door open is really disgusting. 
 - Hey! When did I do that?

627
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:32,290
- That's because the bathroom door is broken! 
 - You're also quite uneducated.

628
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:34,570
- What? 
 - I saw your diary.

629
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:36,940
You got a lot of your words spelled wrong.

630
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:41,290
You spelled easy with two e's and dumbfounded without the b.

631
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:43,020
Why did you read my diary?

632
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:46,530
- Because you're careless about where you place things. 
 - You're really—

633
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:50,720
I'm seriously so dumbfounded right now without the b! What about you then?

634
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:51,970
You think you're such a catch?

635
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:54,470
Honestly, you're not really my type.

636
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:57,090
I came to terms with your looks.

637
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:58,930
But the more I thought about it, the more it felt unfair.

638
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:02,030
How did a loser like me, end up with a bigger loser like you?

639
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:04,700
Shouldn't the loser end up with a prince? Isn't that a fair trade?

640
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:09,660
- How is that a trade? That's a scam. 
 - Hey, you!

641
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:12,490
You... this is how you really feel, right?

642
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:15,360
It's too detailed!

643
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:18,430
Cute.

644
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:25,090
You're so cute.

645
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:44,250
Let's go out.

646
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:54,290
- What? 
 - I want to buy you something.

647
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,230
I want to go out.

648
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:03,890
Start an open search for her. Just expose Min Woo Cheon too now that things have gone this far.

649
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:06,300
Serial killer and a hit man.

650
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:09,370
- We have to go in strong. 
 - We can't do that.

651
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:13,440
- Hey! 
 - There are no grounds to view this as a serial murder.

652
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,370
- We have to continue our investigation— 
 - Do you want to get fired, too?

653
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:21,000
If this drags out, it's not only your job that's on the line.

654
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,360
I'm on the verge of getting fired, too!

655
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:28,690
What is this?

656
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:36,960
Is Heaven helping me?

657
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,320
What happened?

658
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,990
This is nonsense.

659
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:43,320
Apparently In Sook and Woo Cheon...

660
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:46,430
Gosh.

661
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:49,390

662
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:09,330
- Oppa! 
  - I'm sorry I got upset last time.

663
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:11,890
 I was a little on edge.

664
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:14,920
No, I'm sorry.

665
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:18,300
 I was so scared because you didn't call me.

666
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:22,030
Don't worry about anything. We're going to proceed with the succession procedure.

667
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:24,970
Let's get married as planned after that.

668
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:27,400
Thank you.

669
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:31,330
What should we do?

670
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:34,900
Why?

671
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:47,870
- Are you happy that we are out? 
 - Yes.

672
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,770
You both have such friendly faces.

673
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:04,590
- I doubt that. 
 - No, really! I'd like to talk about your spirits.

674
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:08,890
It's because I feel bad for you two. I have to perform an ancestral rite for you.

675
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:11,390
I'm sorry.

676
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:15,760
Hello. I'm a college student out taking surveys.

677
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,370
- Do you have any— 
 - Go try talking to her.

678
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:35,770
Are you okay? Can you stand up?

679
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:49,520
Ji Min!

680
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,760
Are you okay? Thank you.

681
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,700
Are you not hurt? Are you okay?

682
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,930
Thank you.

683
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:02,530
Let's go.

684
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:05,960
There.

685
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:24,220

686
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,980

687
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:02,290
♫  Stay with me  ♫

688
01:01:02,290 --> 01:01:05,900

689
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,530
 You saw the third article, right?

690
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:11,220
 People are going crazy that Pyo In Sook and Min Woo Cheon killed them while running away.

691
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:14,670
 She ran away because you guys are barking up the wrong tree!

692
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:18,030
 - You don't think she's lying dead somewhere, right? 
 - I wonder if that was an accident.

693
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:20,160
 When did things start to go wrong?

694
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,530
 The brother is with me.

695
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:24,930
 I don't know if it's right for only me to be happy like this.

696
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:27,560
 To think that I'll die like that... that scares me the most.

697
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,090
 It's only a matter of time for us to get caught. There's nowhere else to go.

698
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:34,700
 Look at me. I'm ruined like this. Just please help her to not feel pain.

699
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:40,340
♫  Even if I lose my way for a moment  ♫
