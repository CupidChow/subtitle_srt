1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:07,980

2
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,850
 I'm sorry. This time I will be the one that saves you.

3
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,480

4
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,570
What you're saying is while passing by, you thought the child was in danger so you swung a golf club at him on impulse?

5
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,670
Yes.

6
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,200
- There was a golf club nearby? 
 - Yes.

7
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,140
Where did that gold club disappear to?

8
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,480
I don't know. I left it there.

9
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,950
You brought the child to a house with lights on and you fell asleep there.

10
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,720
- On your way out, you put a flower on the victim's head? 
 - Yes.

11
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,950
- Simple because it was pretty? 
 - Yes.

12
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,580
For accidental murders, the person usually flees the scene or falls into panic because they don't know what to do.

13
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,870
I know that it's weird.

14
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,730
It's just... hard to explain.

15
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,930
Pyo In Sook. Is what you said back then true?

16
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:22,610
About how you coincidentally saw the picture of the girl who saved you as a kid and the hospice thing.

17
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,180
Yes.

18
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,410
Was it a floral tribute for the dead?

19
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,410
Ji Hoo, please hold on to this for me.

20
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Unnie!

21
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,430
Woo Cheon... Where is Woo Cheon?

22
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,950
- Turning himself in. 
 - What?

23
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:23,280
Because of you, it's over. He went there to end this.

24
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,280
 Hyung, I'm going to turn myself in.

25
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,050
 Isn't that what the other side wanted anyway?

26
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,470
 Don't say such nonsense! Why would you?

27
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,600
 Please get a hold of yourself!

28
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,940
 I'm going to pay for my crimes now.

29
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,420
 I want to do that now.

30
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:49,660
 W-oo Cheon, t-that woman i-is terminally ill. She's going to die anyway. Why would you do that for a dying woman?

31
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,050
 That girl said...

32
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,620
 that everyone lives until they die.

33
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,970
 Stop playing with words.

34
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,560
 No. Just stay put and I'll take care of it.

35
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,420
 Hyung, you should stop now too.

36
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,020
 What?

37
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,000
 When you kill someone,

38
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,410
 someone is left behind.

39
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,710
 I really hate being left behind.

40
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,590
 Please, Hyung. I've never asked you for a favor before.

41
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,260
 So, please, I ask of you this one time.

42
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,040
 Please take care of that woman for me.

43
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,280
 Buy her delicious food and give her money.

44
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,440
 I'll turn myself in so give the money to her.

45
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,050
 Also, to her grandmother. A house where they can live well in.

46
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,440
 But... I don't even know what she likes.

47
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,660
 I couldn't ask her anything...

48
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,160
 so I know nothing.

49
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,820
You don't know him. You don't know how he has lived.

50
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,740
Although he wasn't happy, living as he has lived so far

51
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,220
might have been the safest option.

52
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,080
That dog is Woo Cheon's only family. He wanted this place to take care of him.

53
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,800
What was that? Who is that?

54
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,090
What kind of golf club did you use?

55
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,860
I don't think it's any of these.

56
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,450
Have a thorough look at the shape.

57
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,890
I don't know since it was too dark.

58
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,270
Do you remember the texture of the handle?

59
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,030
I'm not sure.

60
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,920
Did you kill Ha Yong Geun by swinging a golf club you found nearby?

61
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,540
Yes.

62
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,960
 It's been determined that the cause of death is asphyxiation.

63
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,250
The cause of death is asphyxiation.

64
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,250
Lieutenant.

65
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,820
- So what? 
 - Woo Cheon went to confess.

66
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,120
- So what about that? 
 - What?

67
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,450
It's for the better. He went there to kill the guy anyway.

68
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:07,830
Since an article even came out, we should block it before we get investigated too.

69
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,450
- We should be grateful. 
 - He has to keep living though.

70
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,350
We're dying. We're going to die soon.

71
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,290
That's right. We're dying. You're about to die, and what?

72
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,290
Are you going to try something with him? Want to date him?

73
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,430
- Stop it. 
 - What about you?

74
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,580
I'm into a chaebol. 
  (T/N: chaebol- heir to large conglomerate)

75
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,680
I'm trying to have a heroic death after creating a grand image. What about it?

76
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,460
Just please stop.

77
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,000
Unnie! Don't make me the only bad person here.

78
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,520
Is there anybody here who wants to die in prison?

79
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,050
Although we've done the deed, we're all scared.

80
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,690
Even though we want to say we can do everything since we're dying, the truth is, we can't.

81
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,920
Because we're alive right now. Because we have to live!

82
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:58,290
- What's wrong? 
 - Well... She's trying to go somewhere without helping us first.

83
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,630
Hey!

84
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,790
He came to turn himself in but he ended up proving that he didn't do it.

85
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:12,220
Why would you throw a wrench in things? The case was practically closed.

86
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,770
- He didn't know it was asphyxiation. 
 - What if it was a high level tactic?

87
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,560
Why would he do that after turning himself in?

88
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,390
Since he's the most likely suspect, he wants to drive the point that it isn't him.

89
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,110
He knew that the weapon used was a golf club.

90
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,130
- Either way, he's involved in this case. 
 - He also placed the moss rose there.

91
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:31,490
In the time between the golf club and the moss rose, somebody strangled Ha Yong Geun

92
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,180
and Min Woo Cheon was not aware of that fact.

93
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,500
Was it Min Woo Cheon who swung the golf club?

94
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,650
Let's reimagine the scene using his statement.

95
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:49,990
 While passing by, he thought the child was in danger so he swung the golf club he found nearby.

96
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,860
 He brought the unconscious child to a house nearby with lights on.

97
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,310
In the time in between, someone strangled the collapsed Ha Yong Geun and took the phone?

98
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,290
I mean... Do you believe his words right now?

99
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,710
Did he turn himself in thinking that he was the one who killed him?

100
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,290
He could have confessed to protect someone, too.

101
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,260
Pyo In Sook?

102
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:28,030
 No. It can't be.

103
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:32,380
 I killed him. It was all because of me.

104
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,710

105
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:46,160

106
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,030
We'll continue with the investigation without detention.

107
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,980
You're going to that place anyway, correct? The hospice.

108
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,590

109
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,630
What is it? What happened?

110
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,490
Why did you come here?

111
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,380
To turn myself in.

112
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,620
Did you really do it?

113
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,790
Yeah, I killed him.

114
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,650
You didn't know?

115
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,170
- Let's go for a walk first. 
 - I said I'm turning myself in.

116
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,980
Let's just walk!

117
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,310
- I'm putting this to an end. 
 - Put an end to what? Why?

118
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,970
Why? Because I murdered him.

119
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,490
I did it because I was going to die soon anyway.

120
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:55,320
I hate being anxious like this and I don't want to cause harm to others.

121
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,020
Did you want to kill that man that much?

122
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,520
Yeah.

123
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,090
I said I was going to protect San Ah.

124
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,430
But I'm about to die

125
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,680
and then she will be alone.

126
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,950
She has to live.

127
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,490
What about me?

128
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,390
Can't you give me time?

129
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,770
If In Sook turns herself in, what happens to us?

130
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:42,280
We shouldn't be staying here right now. Shouldn't we go and get her?

131
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,140
The detective that came then, where's his business card?

132
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:50,130
- Love... it's quite interesting, isn't it? 
 - What?

133
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:56,760
It enables a selfish person to act in the interest of another.

134
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:03,010
Why are you doing this again? It scares me when you talk with that blank stare.

135
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,940
I couldn't do that even when I was in love.

136
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,910
Whatever it is, I was always hesitant.

137
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,180
Then I ran away.

138
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,290
Why are you suddenly ranting about love?

139
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,950
We're about to be ruined because of that damned love.

140
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,550
Do you think you could do that?

141
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,620
Mi Do, come here for a bit.

142
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,920
No.

143
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:34,640
If I had to take the blame for someone, I wouldn't even love them to begin with.

144
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,550
Did that girl not come?

145
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,460
Y-Yeah...

146
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,820
It must be rough.

147
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:52,050
By the way, a lot of people came. LE Group is really no joke. Even reporters came.

148
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,050
They're from the promotion team. I called them here.

149
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:58,190
There are news journalists, too. Isn't that Reporter Park?

150
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,620
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

151
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,190
I get to see someone who's hard to meet at such an unexpected place.

152
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:10,350
The new product we're releasing appeals to women's needs so we did this for promotion and we're volunteering while we're at it.

153
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:13,060
It's been a while Reporter Park. Thank you for coming.

154
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,680
I see that Sung Mi Do is in this hospice, too.

155
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,690
You must be really close.

156
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,350
Oh, yes.

157
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,840
What if a rumor starts up that you're dating?

158
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,150
What? N-No!

159
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,040
We are dating.

160
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,920
What?

161
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,420
I just wanted to walk like this.

162
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:07,090
Since we're outside and it's loud, you can't hear well.

163
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,880
I've...

164
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,810
heard your voice before.

165
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,910
"I'm okay." That's what you said.

166
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:22,300
 - Are you okay? 
 - I'm okay.

167
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,850
You already know?

168
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,460
Why didn't you say anything?

169
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:48,020
I wasn't confident. I thought you would regret saving me.

170
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,620
I don't regret it.

171
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,640
No... Make me not regret it.

172
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:02,570
You... have time.

173
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,720
You should live.

174
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,250
So now...

175
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,730
From now on...

176
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,930
live differently.

177
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,560
Live well.

178
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,090
Okay?

179
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,210
- How can you do that suddenly? 
 - Do what?

180
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,430
Saying that we're dating in front of those reporters...

181
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,440
Isn't it not true?

182
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,020
It's not that... You didn't say anything to me.

183
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,350
I wouldn't do this for a woman I'm not dating.

184
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,430
You have to confess to me first.

185
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,890
But we even slept together.

186
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,500
Is that a confession?!

187
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,110
Confession?

188
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,430
You mean, "Let's date, I like you." Like that?

189
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,380
What are they doing?

190
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,620
Mi Do, I like you. It's fun when I'm with you.

191
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,590
I care about you. Let's date.

192
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:33,310
Being here like this...

193
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:37,710
I feel like those kids, like ordinary people.

194
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,210
You want to be ordinary?

195
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,740
Yeah.

196
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:49,620
Like nothing happened, like everything's okay.

197
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,470
Let's do it.

198
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,230
What kind of food do you like?

199
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,350
- The ones I have to wait for. 
 - What?

200
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:39,620
The kind that is cooked for you while you wait.

201
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,900
Back then, my mom made donuts for me once.

202
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:51,260
I don't remember the taste, but waiting for something my mom was cooking for me

203
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,240
made me feel like it would taste good.

204
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:14,380

205
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,690
Let's get one rice cake.

206
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,770
I want fish cakes, too.

207
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:21,580
Fish cake, fritters,

208
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,930
and beer.

209
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,000
But do you have money?

210
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,850
Uh... wait a minute.

211
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,590
I don't have my credit card. What should we do?

212
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,180
You came out but you didn't bring money?

213
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,190
I was going to turn myself in. Why would I bring money?

214
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,620
Let's go.

215
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,400
I'm sorry.

216
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,890
I'm sorry.

217
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,850
- You have a cellphone, right? 
 - Huh?

218
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:21,270
I saw Granny Cheon Deok sell stuff at a resale market.

219
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:24,250
Let's look for it.

220
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,790
Should we sell that?

221
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,000
I bought this at a bazaar with my money. I won't.

222
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,550
Do you have anything?

223
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,240
Should I sell this?

224
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,400
Who will buy this?

225
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,380
Someone will buy it since you can't find it anywhere. It's precious.

226
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,990
I didn't want the tape to wear down so I listened to it sparingly.

227
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,320
My mom used to listen to it.

228
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,630
She said when I was crying as a baby, I would smile after she put this on.

229
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:22,090
How can you sell that?

230
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,540
I think it's the right time to do so.

231
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,410
Right now.

232
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:42,910
♫  I will be like a star  ♫

233
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:48,020
♫  I feel your wave, yeah  ♫

234
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:53,080
♫  In the tangled maze  ♫

235
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,090
♫  I follow the light  ♫

236
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:17,000
♫  In this world, the one and only person for me  ♫

237
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,420
I was always one of the people passing by.

238
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:41,850
I was jealous of the people who sat here watching from the inside.

239
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,750
What's this? You even got a candle?

240
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,550
It's my birthday.

241
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,380
Really?

242
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,880
For real?

243
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,570
I want it to be. Blow it.

244
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,200
Go ahead and blow it.

245
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,240
What was that?

246
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,270
Pretty.

247
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,480
It came out well.

248
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:11,890
Why did we come here? You said we were going somewhere important.

249
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,520
Because it's disappearing.

250
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,110
What?

251
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:23,780
People don't use this bridge anymore.

252
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,410
This place will disappear soon, too.

253
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:30,960
I walked this road every day.

254
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:36,700
I waited here for my mom to finish work

255
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,480
and I always walked across this bridge with her.

256
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,390
If I wasn't here, I would leave a message here.

257
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:51,380
It will say "Mom, I'm going somewhere. I'll be at some place."

258
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,140
I scattered Mom's ashes here.

259
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:59,710
Mom left a last message here.

260
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,090
What did it say?

261
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:03,160
Just a sentence.

262
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,960
"Woo Cheon, it's okay."

263
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:28,230
You know,

264
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,220
I'm okay now.

265
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:36,980
When I was told I was going to die... You know that bucket list thing?

266
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:41,770
I tried writing it but nothing came to mind.

267
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:46,840
I just wrote down what other people do.

268
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:54,130
But you know, I got to do all of it today.

269
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:59,610
I thought they wouldn't feel like much... but it felt special

270
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,930
because I did them with you.

271
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,320
♫  A long night  ♫

272
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:19,090
♫  If everything passes and disappears, will it be erased, then?  ♫

273
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:24,620
♫  Inside my memory  ♫

274
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:32,880
♫  If you're smiling, I'm Happy End  ♫

275
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,130
♫  All the moments we drew together  ♫

276
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:48,730
♫  can never be erased  ♫

277
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,400
Woo Cheon.

278
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,680
What?

279
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,080
I'm going to turn myself in.

280
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,890
I didn't know...

281
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:22,140
that you went back there that night to strangle him. I didn't know.

282
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:26,690
What? Why would I go back there?

283
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:29,920
Strangle? What are you talking about?

284
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,850
It wasn't you?

285
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:34,070
No... What are you talking about?

286
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,260
So, it wasn't you?

287
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,670
- What? 
 - So it wasn't you.

288
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:45,310
It was not you. It wasn't me either.

289
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:49,080
That man didn't die from the golf club.

290
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,170
He was alive then.

291
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:55,010
Someone strangled him while he was lying there.

292
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,430
Who did it?

293
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:13,320
Lieutenant! We got another phone signal.

294
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,250
It's near the Kamyeong Market Cell Tower.

295
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,910
Yes. The cellphone was turned off again.

296
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:36,270
This is a redevelopment site. Send in a search team for a 10 kilometer radius.

297
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:47,490

298
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:07,600
All of your items that contained a part of your life

299
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,440
were purchased by a lot of people.

300
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,500
Now, think back to those moments.

301
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,570
Whether they be happy or sad moments,

302
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:22,050
embrace them warmly in your hearts.

303
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,850
Yes!

304
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,790
Today's profit

305
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:30,630
will be donated to fund women from low-income families.

306
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:36,120
Everyone, you really worked hard today!

307
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,270
I don't think I can eat pancakes for a while.

308
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:44,790
You lived well today, too.

309
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,630
When do we sleep?

310
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:55,130
Then, what is the highlight prepared by LE Group?

311
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:58,180
We'll start the fireworks.

312
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:02,860
Let's enjoy the fireworks together!

313
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:08,660
Mom! It's my first time seeing fireworks. I'm excited!

314
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,030
I'm seeing it for the first time, Ji Hoo.

315
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,630
Why is In Sook not coming?

316
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,460
She'll probably be here.

317
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,920
The best day of my life.

318
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,550
It would really be something if the cops came and arrested us now.

319
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,970
Be quiet. You're being obvious.

320
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,360
I'm so anxious.

321
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:36,370
You're good at riding stranger's cars, too... What if we get caught while riding this...

322
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:39,230
For now, let's just get out of this area.

323
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:42,390
By the way, who's following us?

324
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:45,680
Whoever it may be. I just have a feeling.

325
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,950
A feeling?

326
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:52,610
When you live the way I did, you develop a sense for it.

327
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:58,290
If we're not the ones who did it, can't we just tell the police the truth?

328
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:04,090
I swung the golf club and you carried the child back and placed the moss rose there.

329
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,940
We don't know who strangled him in between.

330
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:10,140
We'll be able to get out of murder charges.

331
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:15,340
If you hastily step up, you can become the scapegoat.

332
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,520
Scapegoat?

333
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:21,490
They're people who do not care about the truth. Closing the case is what matters.

334
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:26,640
I've seen that a lot of times. Putting the blame on pushovers.

335
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,630
As long as we're involved with the case, we're easy targets to put the blame on.

336
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,590
The phone disappeared, too.

337
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,120
The cellphone?

338
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,820
Is it that man's cellphone?

339
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,290
Yes. His cellphone.

340
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:47,760
There must be something in that phone.

341
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:53,220
I think he's using it for blackmail. That's why I was ordered to kill him.

342
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,320
 Grandma!

343
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,130
Did you eat?

344
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,450
What about San Ah?

345
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:18,970
She went to her friend's house.

346
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,710
Her friend's house?

347
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:23,110
We video called earlier.

348
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:26,880
I got the phone number, she said she's coming back later.

349
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,310
Give me a glass, too.

350
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,810
- It's good! 
 - Grab some kimchi, for your health.

351
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:43,300
Grandma, thank you.

352
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,530
For what?

353
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:49,250
Thanks to you watching over San Ah, I can work.

354
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,830
This feels like it could be my real family home.

355
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,580
You can't raise a child alone.

356
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:03,980
If I knew that before,

357
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:10,450
when In Sook's mom was raising her, I should have helped a bit.

358
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:15,720
I thought that not looking or going there was helping.

359
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,910
But if I had helped a little,

360
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:23,150
I think that her mom wouldn't have left like that.

361
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:28,310
As I get older, my regrets just increase.

362
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,970
These days, I live while looking back and wondering if I did anything wrong.

363
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:39,810
I look back again and again.

364
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:43,180
If I hadn't done anything wrong,

365
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:51,390
the heavens wouldn't have treated me this way.

366
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:04,010
They couldn't possibly have treated me this way.

367
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:14,280
To me, In Sook is my legs, arms, flesh, and bones.

368
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,720
She's my everything!

369
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,980
Why? Are you embarrassed?

370
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,510
Since you're coming back after saying you quit?

371
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,300
Yeah.

372
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:41,080
But now, this is all we have.

373
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:44,670
Baek Gu is here, too.

374
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:47,510
Yeah, my mom.

375
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:49,810
Hm?

376
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,390
My mom said

377
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:54,910
that if she died, she would reincarnate as a dog.

378
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,780
Dogs can tell time, too.

379
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,780
- How? 
 - By smell.

380
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:05,880
When its owner leaves the house, its owner's potent smell will gradually fade.

381
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:12,390
The dog knows how much the smell should fade by the time its owner comes home.

382
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:17,360
So to dogs, smell is their clock.

383
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,040
My mom said that

384
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,740
wherever I am or whereabout I'm coming from,

385
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,750
she'll know wherever it is by the smell.

386
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:02,510
 It's beautiful.

387
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:20,110
 Look at these.

388
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:23,650
Oppa, it's so pretty.

389
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,690
Mom, is it pretty?

390
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:30,190
Yes, so pretty.

391
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,900
They're back.

392
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,120
Unnie!

393
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,980
How did you get here?

394
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,250
I came to give you a gift.

395
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,420
It's a diary.

396
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,610
If it's this thick, you can use it until you die.

397
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,150
Thanks.

398
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,600
Why is this person here?

399
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:36,290
He volunteers here.

400
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,930
Volunteer?

401
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,580
Um, well...

402
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,900
You, don't think of anything.

403
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,360
This is an issue where there will be no answer if you try to think about it.

404
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,650
You're not going home? Did you tell your mom?

405
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:53,130
Yes, I said that I went to my friend's house to study.

406
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,850
It's pretty late now...

407
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,230
I'll take a taxi to get back.

408
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,620
- With what money? 
 - I have money!

409
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:02,220
I sold my dad's watch. His marriage watch.

410
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:17,050
- Was it by chance... a blue watch? 
 - Yeah.

411
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,170
Did it happen to be broken?

412
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,630
How did you know?

413
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,930
Where did you get that watch?

414
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:25,580
My mom had it.

415
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,680
Your mom?

416
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:23,180
Have you guys seen the article?

417
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:30,050
What's up with my face? It came out bigger than Ji Pyo's.

418
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:33,050
Ugh, so annoying.

419
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:42,020
 On the 18th, in the middle of downtown Seoul,

420
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:45,970
 the discovery of a man's corpse has given citizens a great shock.

421
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:49,590
 According to the police, the victim was found

422
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,970
- They're crazy. 
  with a flower that appears to be a moss rose stuck above his head.

423
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:56,450
Why would they stick a flower after killing him? What the heck?

424
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,730
What's the deal with the moss rose?

425
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:03,160
Well, that is... there was a moss rose blooming between some stones,

426
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,200
and it was so pretty...

427
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,220
- Are you really insane? 
 - I felt off that day,

428
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:12,460
I saw In Sook's childhood photos...

429
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,030
What are you talking about?

430
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,880
It got weirder after you put the flower there!

431
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,060
Is it sane to stick a flower in a dead person's hair?

432
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:24,260
But... you went to turn yourself in, how were you released?

433
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:28,710
- That is... 
 - Because it's not him. He said they're suspecting me.

434
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:31,560
You? How do they know about you?

435
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:37,950
They came to know that San Ah and I know each other, and that Woo Cheon and I have a connection.

436
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:41,380
- That's not evidence. 
 - They'll investigate.

437
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,530
Then we'll get caught in it, too!

438
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,080
Oh my god! A really popular person just followed me!

439
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,980
Wow, this person too?

440
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,160
No. Definitely not now.

441
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,440
If I get caught up in a situation like this, Ji Pyo's name will be disgraced.

442
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,490
Don't worry.

443
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:16,460
I will never mention you or Se Yeon.

444
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:23,100
Team Leader!

445
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,980
How is the investigation going?

446
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:28,090
The culprit stuck a flower in the victim's hair, are you interpreting this as a psychopath's crime?

447
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:31,810
Is it true that a suspect turned himself in, and was freed?

448
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:32,920
Please say something.

449
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,030
- Team Leader. 
 - Please say something.

450
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:45,190
How did the reporters know? I asked for heavy security.

451
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,830
Ah yes, that is...

452
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:50,090
When he came to turn himself in, I thought the situation had ended, so I mentioned it slightly.

453
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:53,940
But I didn't realize things would end up like this.

454
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:59,020
- This is perfect, just great. 
 - The chief?

455
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:01,790
The timing is not good.

456
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:06,660
- What timing? 
 - Recently, the high-ranking staff was caught drunk driving, right?

457
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:10,340
- They tried to hide their identity and received additional punishments for that. 
 - How does that matter?

458
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,930
Whatever it is, they didn't want to hear that the police are incompetent.

459
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:17,900
It seems like they want to bring up the image by getting the public's attention focused on the "Moss Rose Murder,"

460
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,500
and solving it theatrically.

461
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,720
Let's wait for the DNA results from the golf club to come out.

462
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,040
Hey! Hey!

463
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:02,030

464
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:04,630

465
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:09,030
I think the phone is in that guy's hands,

466
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:12,170
 so I plan on solving it now.

467
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:19,950

468
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,960
Yes, he went to turn himself in,

469
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,850
but I'll go find out what happened.

470
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,880
What do you mean?

471
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:41,090

472
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:46,780
Wait! You really need me! You really need me! Let me live...

473
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:50,460
 Please let me live, let me live.

474
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,830
 I'll do my best!

475
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:01,410
Why isn't she coming out?

476
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,420
Min Ji's dad!

477
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,380
M-My daughter Min Ji, where is she?

478
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:14,520
I warned you.

479
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:21,380
I-I asked, w-where is my daughter?!

480
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:24,460
Don't worry.

481
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:27,660
All right, let's talk about it.

482
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,320
- Where is the phone? 
 - Bring my daughter back first.

483
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,190
That has to happen for me to find it.

484
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:39,590
You're trying to make a deal with me when my face has gotten like this? You said that this was over!!

485
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:45,740
Did that guy really go turn himself in? What kind of crazy investigator releases someone who turns himself in?!

486
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,580
What if the real culprit...

487
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:50,160
is someone else?

488
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:56,430
- Real culprit? 
 - Yes.

489
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:06,360
 There must be something in that phone.

490
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,190
 That's why I was ordered to kill him.

491
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:25,500
- There's no one around Ha Yong Geun whose DNA corresponds with the DNA found on the golf club? 
 - Yes.

492
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:29,190
The public opinion is not good. The phone is a mystery

493
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:31,990
and we set free a suspect who turned himself in.

494
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:36,330
- In every way, it's a spirit that creates a picture. 
 - Through Min Woo Cheon?

495
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,930
Are they saying to make an image with Min Woo Cheon, and end it?

496
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:43,000
One person is missing.

497
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,790
Pyo In Sook.

498
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:48,450
- It was San Ah's mom. 
 - What?

499
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:50,930
When that man collapsed, I definitely saw it.

500
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:54,510
He had a watch on his wrist.

501
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:56,650
That's right... when I put the flower, there was no watch.

502
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:59,280
She came home at some point between those times.

503
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:01,700
So what are we going to do?

504
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:09,690
If San Ah's mom gets taken in, San Ah will be left alone.

505
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:11,470
So?

506
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:16,300
San Ah just started smiling. I've never seen her smile like that before.

507
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:22,600
She just became happy, how could I take that from her?

508
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,020
Where are you going? What are you planning to do?

509
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,080
I will not let all the blame fall on you.

510
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,470
I'm dying anyway, did you forget?

511
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:46,180
That's why I went to kill him.

512
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,820
Because I wanted to protect San Ah. That's why it's all right.

513
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:51,070
Live properly while you're alive!

514
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,930
Don't go–

515
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,670
In Sook.

516
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:20,170
Don't go. Don't go anywhere.

517
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:23,430
Please, okay?

518
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:46,520
I prescribed pain medication, so she will be all right soon.

519
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,070
Why is she like this?

520
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:52,370
Why? Because of her brain tumor.

521
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:59,900
- Does it hurt a lot? 
 - We can't know.

522
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:05,100
Is it really impossible to treat?

523
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:09,260
She gave up life-support treatment.

524
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:14,730
If she gets treatment, how much longer can she live? One year?

525
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:20,630
Six months? No, can she live even one month longer?

526
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:24,760
Well, since dating is something where you get tired and break up quickly anyway,

527
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:28,190
just one year... until we fight and get tired of each other.

528
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:31,970
No... 2 years, maybe...

529
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:49,120
Don't get a divorce. I beg of you.

530
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,180
- Stop it. 
 - Why are you like this?

531
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:55,200
All right, I understand your personality changes when you are sick.

532
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:59,380
- Your heart becomes crooked.... but... 
 - I told you to stop.

533
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:03,390
- Why are you acting shamelessly? 
 - You always worry about what others think, right?

534
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:04,910
Se Yeon!

535
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:06,370
Did you call my mom?

536
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:08,170
Mother-in-Law should know, too.

537
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:10,680
All I wanted was one thing.

538
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:15,360
Give my mom her house. And I wanted to give her my savings.

539
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,830
- But you never replied to that till now. 
 - Is this a money matter?

540
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:22,620
In our relationship... In our love relationship, what is all this?

541
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:27,050
- You not believing me suddenly, and all that... I am so bummed. 
 - Okay, Se Yeon...

542
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:30,520
I don't need money. I am all right.

543
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,930
Mom, will you live forever next to this man?

544
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:36,760
We are a family, right? I will take care of her.

545
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:42,000
You are bothered by your own mother, so you kept wandering outside the house... You will take care of my mom?

546
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,890
- How can you talk like that? 
 - You cannot say no, right? After Mother-in-Law moved in

547
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:49,370
Even on weekends, you went out of the house and came back home late.

548
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:52,520
You told me you went to work, but there was always a golf club in the car.

549
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:56,760
Golf is also a job. Dealing with the buyers... that's also a job.

550
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,950
Really... joking around... gosh!

551
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:12,050
Somehow, the number of men here is increasing. And with good visuals, too.

552
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:13,960
He looks exactly like a swallow.

553
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,410
He resembles me.

554
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:25,370
- Are you here? 
 - Yes.

555
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:31,050
Thank you for cooperating.

556
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:36,340
Right now, she is at the doctor's office. Her condition is not good. As you know, everyone here is a patient.

557
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:38,410
It'll only take a moment.

558
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:46,190
Veronica, we should control ourselves.

559
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:49,760

560
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,090
Open up wider, please.

561
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:54,450

562
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,950
- Thank you for your work. 
 - Thank you!

563
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:03,810
- We heard there were several quarrels, and also reported. 
 - Yes.

564
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:10,250
You are acquainted with the child of that house and to Min Woo Cheon who dropped her in the grandmother's house.

565
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:11,250
Yes.

566
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:14,770
Did you know that San Ah's father was murdered?

567
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:17,490
My grandmother had told me.

568
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:22,930
But this... if you are doing it for all the neighbors, did my grandmother do it as well?

569
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:24,390
Yes.

570
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,710
My grandmother... she doesn't know that I am here, right?

571
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:36,520
- Yes. 
 - Don't tell her. She thinks I am traveling.

572
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:42,040
Soon a simple investigation of witnesses will take place. Let's meet again once you recover.

573
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:54,530
- Give me a divorce. 
 - Really... why are you like this?

574
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:56,850
If you do this, what becomes of me?

575
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:02,630
I know you had a hard time because of my mother. House chores would have been difficult, too.

576
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:05,600
I know you struggled because of the pregnancy and miscarriage.

577
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,280
But that was not only for me, right.

578
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,850
Even I was working outside and did not have time to rest.

579
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:16,720
Se Yeon, everyone lives like that. That's how it is.

580
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,650
I remember now.

581
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:26,790
When I was sleepwalking... I always used to stand in front of the door.

582
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:31,440
I thought, "Why did I do so?"

583
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,530
What are you saying now?

584
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:38,710
You sent me to that room.

585
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:42,830
What?

586
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:47,260
 Ah... then... why...

587
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:50,030
 Mom, are you okay?

588
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:53,110
-  Remove the socks. 
 - Go to him.

589
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:57,600
 I am asking you to remove my socks.

590
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:05,460
 You guys... if you get out,  I'll kill you.

591
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:07,450
 I can't take them off!

592
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:18,460
 Remove my socks.

593
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:22,720
 All I did after going into the room was just...

594
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:27,780
 remove Father's socks while he was screaming.

595
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:34,220
 Then father's screaming subsides.... and he falls asleep. What is that?

596
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,710
 The feeling at that time...

597
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:46,990
Yes, what I had learned at that time.... was humiliation.

598
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:51,100
After getting married, doing the house chores, taking care of my mother-in-law,

599
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:54,190
spreading my legs at the gynecologist's to get pregnant,

600
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:58,870
and supporting you. After living like that, my feeling was

601
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:00,630
was that...

602
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:03,060
Humiliation.

603
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:10,130
- That's why I want to stop now. 
 - What the hell are you saying now?

604
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:13,420
- Huh? 
 - I know. What I am saying

605
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:16,090
will not be understood by anyone.

606
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,570
It's not something the world will understand.

607
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:27,620
The world understands only your words. I know everything.

608
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:42,350
 If San Ah mother is arrested, she will remain alone.

609
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:47,020
 San Ah has started smiling now. I've never seen her smile like that.

610
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:51,570
 Now she started being happy. But how do I grab that from her?

611
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:04,070
Do you have something to say?

612
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:05,770
We meet again.

613
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:11,070
- No. Why... 
 - What's the matter?

614
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:15,310
Last time, you had come to catch hold of our innocent Woo Cheon.

615
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:17,150
- Why did you come again? 
 - Is In Sook the witness?

616
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:18,890
You said it was a murder case.

617
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:23,250
Whatever it may be, how can you do this to a sick girl?

618
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:25,430
- Please calm down. 
 - I find this really strange.

619
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:27,920
Please calm down.

620
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,550
- Is there a CCTV at the hospice? 
 - No, we don't. But why?

621
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:35,590
September, 18th at 9:00. I want to confirm where Pyo In Sook was.

622
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:39,390
She was at the hospice. No one can walk out at night without permission.

623
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:41,190
I can show you the daily records.

624
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:44,630
Can I meet the others who share the room with her?

625
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,630
- No, I got the permiss— 
 - Geez.

626
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,120
I... will... pass by.

627
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,750
Excuse me.

628
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:55,620
I will just pass by.

629
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:58,190
That... guy from then...

630
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:00,990
- That guy. 
 - Something feels off.

631
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:07,520
Oppa, I love it here.

632
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,790
- Do you want to drink?  
 - Yes.

633
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:13,690
But meeting by avoiding people is so difficult.

634
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:15,930
It's difficult, right?

635
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:20,590
On that note, should I move out of the hospice?

636
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:23,720
To live where? Didn't you move out of the officetel?

637
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,360
Ahh, yes I did.

638
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:33,570
Oh right, did you look at today's article?

639
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:36,790
Someone killed and placed a flower on their victim.

640
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:40,660
Why? Are you all right?

641
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,500
Oh yes. I am all right.

642
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:49,820
That's right, it gives goosebumps. Killing someone and placing a flower....

643
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:53,920
Ho Seon's father is the Public Prosecutor General, right? He was interested in that case.

644
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:56,670
Is that so?

645
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:44,930
I don't have anything to write. I have never written a diary.

646
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:01,260
- Are you feeling all right? 
 - Yes.

647
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:04,430
- Did it hurt a lot? 
 - Yes.

648
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:11,290
- What did the police say? 
 - Nothing much. Soon there will be a witness investigation it seems.

649
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:14,730
Would the DNA from there be mine?

650
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:18,830
That's good. It would end in a simple way.

651
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,130

652
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:31,460

653
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:34,970

654
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,940
Annoying.

655
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:45,110
It's really annoying.

656
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:17,230
Accept the call.

657
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:22,960

658
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,630
 I know everything that you did.

659
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:29,860
 Surrender while I am being nice. If not,

660
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:32,570
your grandmother will be in danger.

661
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:39,140
Hello—

662
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:47,700
It's the client.

663
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:52,120
- What should we do about my grandmother? 
 - It's all right. Don't worry. I will protect her.

664
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:13,290
What would happen if this is there?

665
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:16,880
- Why is this with you? 
 - I am asking what can we do with this?

666
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:30,930

667
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:58,070

668
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:04,830

669
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:07,960
 Did anyone witness Pyo In Sook's whereabouts that night?

670
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:09,360
 What do we do? Where do we hide it?

671
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,390
 You should have told me first.

672
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:14,670
 What wrong did my poor kid do?

673
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:16,810
 You have not changed one bit.

674
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:18,600
 I couldn't protect anything.

675
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,060
 Tomorrow, Dad has invited you for lunch. He wanted to see you.

676
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:22,870
 We have to find who "One" is.

677
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:24,960
 There must be a higher-up's weakness in this.

678
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,060
 That's right, there must be at least one miracle in my life.

679
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:30,390
 I will live on.

680
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:32,990
♫  When I open my eyes  ♫

681
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:36,840
