1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:07,900

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,800
 People ask me

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,220
 if I'm actually terminally ill.

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:20,890
 Why do I act so nonchalant while being terminally ill?

5
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:27,760
 Maybe it's because reality hasn't quite hit me yet.

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,820
- What do you think, Oppa? 
 - It suits you.

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,600
 Because my life is still flowing on.

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,790
This is so nice!

9
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,460
 On top of that...

10
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,380
- Do you like it? 
 - Yeah!

11
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,560
 ...these are my happiest times.

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,810
- It suits you. 
 - Really?

13
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,860
 "Reality hasn't hit me"...

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,320
 Is it just because I'm immature?

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,860
 Perhaps, somewhere deep in my heart,

16
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,900
 couldn't there be some kind of hope?

17
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,270
 Fake medicine that's really candy,

18
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,500
 has helped a patient get up, who was previously unable to.

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,010
 Isn't that what hope is?

20
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,920
 Even people who have been diagnosed with terminal illness

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,260
 retain their hope until the day they die.

22
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,990
 Is that reckless?

23
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,540
You don't have time to stand around like that, hurry up and get in!

24
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,370
 But... rather than despair,

25
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,920
 isn't hope easier?

26
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:51,510

27
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,940
So today, I want to talk about hope.

28
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,980
There's definitely some big news at our hospice today!

29
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,850
Unnie!

30
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,600
All right. Everyone, this is our hospice's

31
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,220
"Hope," hope, Ms. Choi Sung Hae.

32
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:16,820
Choi Sung Hae, who has been fighting liver cancer for no less than two years,

33
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:21,810
has been declared fully healed and will be leaving the hospice soon!

34
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,350
Hello, everyone.

35
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:35,720
Two years ago, I was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer,

36
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,850
and I can't help but think of when I first came into the hospice.

37
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:46,840
At that time, I thought that my whole life was over.

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,630
But after coming into this hospice,

39
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,830
my tumor shrank little by little.

40
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,290
So I began to think that I had fully gotten better,

41
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,580
but after leaving, it grew again.

42
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,820
So I had to come back.

43
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:08,130
That's how I spent these two years.

44
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:13,080
So I became this hospice, Morning Light's, "Hope"...

45
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,870
I became hope, didn't I?

46
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:22,180
But... it appears that a miracle has occurred, everyone.

47
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,660
In the end, today...

48
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,280
I was declared fully healed. Thank you.

49
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,760
Thank you!

50
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,810
Since they are 100% nearby, request that the whole area be secured.

51
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,360
We have to catch them at all costs, got it?

52
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,220
 - Yes. 
 - Yes.

53
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,990
Shit...

54
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,650
Is she saving us or capturing us?

55
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,260
I think she's the ring-leader...

56
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,940
Are you okay?

57
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,860
What about Mother-in-law?

58
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,740
Well...

59
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,660
I'm a bit late since I came after seeing her fall asleep.

60
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,110
Since you're not there,

61
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,150
I can't do anything.

62
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,730
Hurry and go back.

63
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,300
I'm all right.

64
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,120
Is that woman the reason you want a divorce?

65
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,730
No.

66
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,290
For a really long time, I...

67
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,970
lived without thinking about myself.

68
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,590
That thought came to mind.

69
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,580
I'm not sure whether it's a strange kind of stubbornness,

70
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:18,190
but it's how I feel. So according to how I feel,

71
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,810
according to my inclinations, is how I want to act.

72
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,270
You don't understand what I'm talking about, do you?

73
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,320
To be honest, I don't really understand.

74
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,000
But you are sick and went into the hospice,

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,310
after that, everything was so sudden.

76
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,210
You were suddenly like a different person.

77
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,220
You...

78
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,450
don't know me.

79
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,230
Because I also... lived without knowing myself.

80
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,000
I know.

81
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,250
Do you know why I fell for you?

82
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,760
Because you were that kind of person.

83
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,670
You were soft but strong, and you chose and made the right decisions.

84
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,190
You were like that in everything you did.

85
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,110
Do you remember how much I had to pester you to marry me?

86
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,960
There were a lot of men who liked you,

87
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,970
and I did all kinds of things to swoop you up.

88
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,300
That's how we got married.

89
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,970
I made you this way.

90
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:37,270
Under the pretense of our office romance, you were fired despite being competent, instead of me.

91
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,300
And you had to take responsibility for my mom after returning home.

92
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:46,500
You repeatedly withstood difficult surgeries to have a child.

93
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,220
I disregarded you...

94
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,180
as you faded like that.

95
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,320
It was unfamiliar to me, and I hated it.

96
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,190
I acted like I didn't even know who you were, as you struggled...

97
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,300
It wasn't me.

98
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,000
You may not have been where you wanted to be,

99
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,190
but you were consistently there.

100
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,540
My mom only looks for you.

101
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,150
She can't even remember my, her son's, own name,

102
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,130
but she remembers yours.

103
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:41,020
She only remembers your name.

104
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,010
Kang Se Yeon...

105
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,160
You were that kind of person.

106
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,930
You were someone who lived like that.

107
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,160
I'm sorry...

108
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,940
You followed Koo Ji Pyo,

109
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,820
and almost died while doing it. Right?

110
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,050
You received the order to murder Ha Yong Geun,

111
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,320
but the situation went off the rails after Pyo In Sook intervened.

112
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,250
As for the second murder of Park Du Jin, the Guseong Gang is involved.

113
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,400
What's their relation to Koo Ji Pyo?

114
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,560
Speak. If you get caught like this,

115
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,850
the case will be closed as the "Moss Rose Serial Killings."

116
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,660
It will be difficult to turn the tide after that.

117
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:45,290
If I speak, what will change?

118
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:50,340
If you had so many suspicions, why are we getting chased like this?

119
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,900
If I tell the truth, how far will it go?

120
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,430
Won't they go with the truth that they want, anyway?

121
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,510
What can you even do at this point?

122
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:04,260
While trying to do something, Jo Si Yeong was kicked out.

123
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,670
I have a child. I have a kid to raise.

124
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:12,980
What that means is, if I get fired, my kid will starve too.

125
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:18,660
So, right now, I am trying to do something while putting my child on the line.

126
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,830
- Why? 
 - Because it's not you guys.

127
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,100
It's simple.

128
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,740
Why is it so hard to hold onto something so simple?

129
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,030
You don't trust the police, do you?

130
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:39,570
That's possible. I'm the same way.

131
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:45,090
I saw my colleague get demoted by external forces when he was trying to investigate according to his convictions,

132
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,500
and I tried to go down the wrong path after getting swept up by irregular public opinion,

133
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,380
so I even cursed my superior...

134
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,070
and I was even conflicted with the thought of just getting comfortably swept up.

135
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:59,900
But... why are you being like this, all of a sudden?

136
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,300
So, what are you going to do? I'm a police officer.

137
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,740
If you don't trust the police, do you have some kind of method?

138
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,650
In the middle of the world rejoicing that a murderer killed some bad guys,

139
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:14,210
if the police take their hands off, what do you think will happen next?

140
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,630
To put it grandiosely,

141
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:22,950
I want to show my kid a world that has a little hope.

142
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,020
Lost?

143
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,570
You lost them?

144
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,320
Yes.

145
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,240
Right in front of you?

146
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,740
How could you lose them with such a large team?

147
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,660
I am sorry.

148
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,720
I am about to be fired now.

149
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,310
Where is Hwang Ma Jin?

150
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,300
I will heavily take into consideration that a child was endangered

151
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,780
before Ha Yong Geun's murder took place.

152
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,130
However, if a second and third murder gets mixed in,

153
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,980
and this becomes a serial murder case, it will be difficult to handle.

154
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,520

155
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,220
In Sook. In Sook, are you okay?

156
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,500
Hospital, p-please go to the hospital.

157
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,290
If we go to the hospital, you'll get caught.

158
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,890
I don't care.

159
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,020
- Why? 
 - Pardon?

160
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,720
Why don't you care?

161
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,460
She can live.

162
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,180
She can pull through and survive longer than expected.

163
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,740
Do you want to throw away that time by being dragged around as a serial killer?

164
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,510
Don't the two of you need that time?

165
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,840
I don't know for whom

166
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,690
or what you are hiding, that is leading you to take all of the blame,

167
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,940
but are you certain that that's what's best for that person?

168
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:03,890
Are you judging others' paths as you please?

169
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:09,440
There are many cases where someone is deluded that they are making a sacrifice when they are actually being narcissistic.

170
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,650
If that's really what you want, do it.

171
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:19,540
All I have to do is close my eyes and take the safe route.

172
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,040

173
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,460
In Sook, try to get up.

174
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,390
In Sook.

175
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,800
Wait a second.

176
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,220
I don't think this place will work.

177
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,970
I-I-I don't want anything, just let me go o-overseas.

178
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,340
Hey! We're in the same boat, so what am I supposed to do if the boat goes that way?

179
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,170
You expect me to swim on my own?

180
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:01,730
I-I got it. W-What do you want me to do? Don't hit me...

181
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,520
I considered just killing him at first,

182
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,350
but come to think of it, I wouldn't gain anything from that. So I thought a little more.

183
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:17,320
What if I torture him to my heart's content with the video, and squeeze him of all the money he's worth?

184
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,350
Ha Yong Geun died trying to do that.

185
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,380
Hey, let's make a fortune and then turn a blind eye to it.

186
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,660
This isn't about the video.

187
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,350
I have evidence that Koo Ji Pyo was behind Park Du Jin's murder.

188
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,900
Because I killed him. But I'm dead,

189
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,290
and the person who killed me was Koo Ji Pyo.

190
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,640
Wow, the scale is huge, isn't it?

191
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,440
So the payout will be huge, too.

192
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,430
This will be the safest place.

193
00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:02,560
While I'm trying to do something, you two lay low here.

194
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,220
Get her treated, to start... and rest.

195
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:14,080
After that, you need to help me. You must tell me the truth.

196
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:31,820
It's Narae Cleaning's transaction records. The people who commissioned murders.

197
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:40,050
It's the only evidence that can tie people who I killed to Koo Ji Pyo.

198
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:43,320
If things go this way, you have no choice but to get wrapped up in it too.

199
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,040
I... don't care what happens to me.

200
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:57,290
What...? Where are we?

201
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,450
Let's go.

202
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,830
Take this.

203
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,870
- It's pretty, isn't it? 
 - It is.

204
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,900
Leave it up there.

205
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,160
Hello?

206
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,690
What?

207
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,190
Hey, do this and try going to school,

208
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,920
the other kids will seriously go crazy.

209
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:36,230
They will go crazy, laughing to death.

210
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,240
If you do nail art, your whole mood will change.

211
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,840
This is total healing!

212
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,510
Mi Do, after the hospice discharge party tomorrow,

213
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,720
are you going to eat dinner at that chaebol's place?

214
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,400
Yes.

215
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,900
You're meeting his family for the first time, right?

216
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,180
Yes... I'm really so nervous that I could die.

217
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:02,440
What should I wear? What should I say? I feel like my head will explode!

218
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:09,260
Unnies, you've never seen a chaebol family, have you?

219
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,820
Well now, see... there she goes again.

220
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,900
No! It's the first time for me, too.

221
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,380
What if the food I've never eaten before comes out?

222
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,720
What if there's an order for grabbing knives or something?

223
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,280
She's cute.

224
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,820
Mi Do, just stab it with a fork.

225
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,530
That's the best part.

226
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:34,900
You'll do great. And even if you can't do things like that, you're still lovely.

227
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,370
Unnie, after dying and coming back to life, how do you feel?

228
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,030
What do you want to do most?

229
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:45,060
Do you have thoughts about needing to live life to the fullest?

230
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,290
No, I want to live ordinarily.

231
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,480
What?

232
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,280
When I thought that I was dying, things that I wanted so badly,

233
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:01,240
things that I thought were a shame, and things that I regretted,

234
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,000
I can't really see things like that anymore.

235
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,540
When you think that you are dying, things that appeared big... go back to being small.

236
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:16,460
To be honest, that was their original size.

237
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,900
"The way that I lived wasn't that bad either."

238
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,660
Thoughts like that come to mind...

239
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,220

240
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:57,920

241
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,360
A miracle happened!

242
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,470
Choi Sung Hae has fully recovered.

243
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,410
- Really? 
 - Yes.

244
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,960
As life goes on, things like this happen, too.

245
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,860
It would be nice if you guys could join the party.

246
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,730
That's a relief.

247
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,000
Things really turned out great.

248
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,580
Everyone was worried about Sung Hae's condition.

249
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,780
On days when she looked unusually healthy, everyone wondered what she ate that made her that way.

250
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,700
If she was like that because she exercised, then they followed her.

251
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,950
And on days when she looked unwell, everyone was nervous.

252
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,350
Yes, it's a relief.

253
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:44,010
And on a day as great as this, you coming back to the hospice

254
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,880
is also a relief.

255
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,760
For the time being, I think that you may need to live here.

256
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,050
Now, there aren't many patients. But if someone sees you, it could be dangerous.

257
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:10,020
You will need to have your meals here, as well.

258
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,610
What about Mi Do and Se Yeon?

259
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,230
It would be best if they didn't know.

260
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,300
Se Yeon is in the hospital right now.

261
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,520
Why? Is she very sick?

262
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,560
What happened?

263
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,010
Don't worry too much.

264
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:25,550
Her condition is stable and she'll be returning here tomorrow.

265
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,580
What about my grandmother?

266
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,160
Can I not even see my grandmother?

267
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,050
That's a bit... I'll think about it.

268
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,670
All right.

269
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,680
Sister.

270
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,420
Thank you.

271
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:02,750
You are a patient of our hospice.

272
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,650
Straighten your shoulders.

273
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:10,450
But your hospital fees have been delayed.

274
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:16,570
Since it seems that many patients have pulled out, management is getting more difficult.

275
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:22,560
That being said, while you're staying here, I'll give you 50% off.

276
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,400
All right.

277
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,000
Here it is.

278
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,550
It's right. Stay healthy!

279
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,700
Thank you.

280
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,420
Grandma!

281
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,680
What are you doing?

282
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,460
Hope! It's my hope.

283
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,370
You came to eat? Let's head inside.

284
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:09,590
But why is the house so empty?

285
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:12,710
I'm going to put it up for lease.

286
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,470
What about you, then?

287
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,580
For the time being, I can go and live at the hospice,

288
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,880
and my son said that he is selling his store, too.

289
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,060
He said that we should all live together with In Sook.

290
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,750
Then, what about me?

291
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:29,950
My goodness, don't worry. We'll stay in this area.

292
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,830
But why are you doing this, all of a sudden?

293
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:40,210
Because I need money...

294
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:47,320
But... since earlier,

295
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,530
why can't you look at me straight on?

296
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,450
- Pardon? 
 - I feel like you just keep

297
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,750
stealthily reading the room.

298
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,670
Of course not! Eat some of this.

299
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:07,730
You're so busy, why are you bringing all of this? Eat up.

300
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:13,750
Thanks to you, I came to know what a home is.

301
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,100
What?

302
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,790
Ever since I was young, my house was the most unsettling place.

303
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,990
My mom also lived her whole life getting hit.

304
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,720
If my dad started hitting my mom,

305
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,780
I watched that entire scene while trapped in a small room.

306
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,420
I...

307
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:39,010
was always afraid of home.

308
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,730
I got married to escape that house,

309
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,280
but that house was another hell.

310
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,270
San Ah, you would have done the same.

311
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,690
But a home has appeared for us.

312
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:03,360
Warm and comfortable, a real home.

313
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,190
Thanks to you, San Ah and I–

314
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:11,480
My goodness, I told you that I'm not going far!

315
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,280
It's just that...

316
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,760
I'm so thankful.

317
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,320
Eat up.

318
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,190
Have you gotten it together now?

319
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,970
It wasn't my fault.

320
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:33,650
That's right. Of course. You guys, eat a lot.

321
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,650
It's so...

322
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,720
strange. My granddaughter is terminally ill,

323
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,050
and is getting chased down as some kind of murderer,

324
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:59,430
but the food goes down and disappears.

325
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:03,660
That's life, isn't it?

326
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,900
That's how people are.

327
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,310
It looks so good!

328
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:28,680
I researched online yesterday,

329
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,960
and there were a lot of cases like that.

330
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,560
There are a ton of people that get cured of cancer.

331
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,470
Of course! You're healthy. Don't believe everything the doctor says.

332
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,620
That's right.

333
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,170
Of course, the heart is what's most important.

334
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:45,250
Hey! Stop saying things that are obvious.

335
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,880
That thing you usually eat,

336
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,760
hand everything over before you leave. Give us everything that's good for our health.

337
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,400
Hey, of course, Grandma!

338
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,470
I don't need it anymore, I'm all better!

339
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,850
Se Yeon, are you okay?

340
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,310
You're okay?

341
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:08,380
I heard the news and was so surprised.

342
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:11,260
- Congratulations. 
 - Thanks.

343
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,850
You'll be all right. You're doing great.

344
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,950
Unnie! Are you okay?

345
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:25,010
Everyone has their sick days every once in a while.

346
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:28,340
Eventually, you'll be completely cured.

347
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:32,910
Oh, you said that you had a family gathering today, didn't you?

348
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:37,070
- What are you going to wear? 
 - That's my biggest concern right now.

349
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:42,300
There really isn't much time until the wedding.

350
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:47,710
I would like it if I could make it to your wedding.

351
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:52,170
What are you talking about? You have to go with me.

352
00:25:55,670 --> 00:26:00,870
In a shitty emergency situation like this, where the culprit was lost right in front of our noses,

353
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:04,050
where did you disappear to that you are showing up just now?

354
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,850
My kid was sick.

355
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,990
What? In that case, you should have said something before disappearing.

356
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,940
Why didn't you answer the phone?

357
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,940
- Bread... 
 - What?

358
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,780
I think my kid accidentally ate bread.

359
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:19,340
Everything was so hectic because I had to carry him to the emergency room.

360
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,580
They died and came to life after eating bread.

361
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,960
About the third murder case...

362
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,740
- What? 
 - Team Leader.

363
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,170
There are three suspects for the third murder.

364
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:33,780
Firstly, one of them corresponds with the DNA found at the crime scene,

365
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,710
- and I'm waiting for the autopsy results from forensics– 
 - So?

366
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:39,630
The chances that this is not a serial murder are large.

367
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,460
We need to change the direction of the investigation.

368
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,620
At this point? We put up wanted announcements and couldn't catch them,

369
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,340
so we're claiming that it wasn't a serial murder. The public will just see it as an excuse.

370
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,400
You're suggesting that we admit to making wrong guesses starting from the primary investigation?

371
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,150
But we can't convict an innocent person of being a serial killer.

372
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,980
Then, why did they turn themselves in?

373
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,900
- Why did they run away? 
 - There must be a reason.

374
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,570
We don't need a reason right now, we need evidence!

375
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:06,220
We need to follow that reason in order to find evidence.

376
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,450
Why are you being like this to me?

377
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,950
Hey! A reason or no reason,

378
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:16,480
bring undebatable evidence!

379
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,680
After catching and bringing in Min Woo Cheon and Pyo In Sook, start talking.

380
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,910
Ugh! Seriously...

381
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:53,890
Because you're smiling, it's like I'm dreaming.

382
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:58,360
Do you remember? When you first came to find me here,

383
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,710
you got hit by Mi Do and were trapped here.

384
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:05,840
You were asleep. So peacefully, despite the circumstances.

385
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,860
Strangely, I fell asleep super easily that day.

386
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,890
I thought you had a screw loose in your head.

387
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,000
I do, don't I?

388
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:24,320
I have memories, too.

389
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,380
- What? 
 - I have a lot of memories at the hospice.

390
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:34,600
After I came here, a lot of good memories appeared.

391
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,600
Do you hear it?

392
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,290
The party is starting, isn't it?

393
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:55,290
I want to see it. Should we sneak out and take a look?

394
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,160
- Are you jealous? 
 - Yeah.

395
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,730
How about we go all the way?

396
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,100
What?

397
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:14,080
Surgery, cancer treatments, everything. Let's do everything we can.

398
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,190
- Maybe– 
 - Maybe...

399
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:22,190
That kind of thing doesn't exist in my life. It never has.

400
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:27,250
Surgery is difficult, too... But even if I say I'll do it, they said that relapse is very likely.

401
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,460
But there's still a possibility that it won't.

402
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:32,590
You could also just fend it off a little longer.

403
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,690
Don't be like that.

404
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:38,760
You knew from the beginning.

405
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,750
We started this while knowing that I was going to die.

406
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:46,970
I met you because I'm dying.

407
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,130
We shouldn't have started in the first place...

408
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:04,360
I should have thought of you being left alone, and let go.

409
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,710
I don't want to do...

410
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,680
that kind of thing.

411
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
This here. What is this?

412
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,220
Don't touch it.

413
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,870
I know you dumped a bunch of ramen seasoning last time.

414
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,340
Don't even think about putting in a bunch of weird stuff, all right?

415
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:54,220
"Weird stuff"? Why would I put something this precious in?

416
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:06,010
Just mind your own business and get back to work.

417
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:08,990
- You must be busy with prep work. 
 - Oh, yes.

418
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,380
I have something to say to you.

419
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:16,660
Look over here, everyone!

420
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,730
- Isn't she so pretty? 
 - Oh, my!

421
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:22,640
Who is that? My goodness.

422
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,080
Grandma!

423
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,320
These girls used the dolls as bait then dressed me up like this.

424
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,640
- I look strange, don't I? 
 - Oh, my.

425
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,200
Grandma, I'm telling you that you really look like a senior influencer.

426
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,780
- Really? 
 - Yes!

427
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,460
- Do I look all right? 
 - Shall I take a picture for you?

428
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,330
You dressed up like the star of the party.

429
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:41,470
- You look pretty. 
 - Let's take a picture together!

430
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,890
You're jealous, aren't you?

431
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:45,080
- Look here! 
 - Come here, let's take a picture.

432
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,560
In one, two, three!

433
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,340
This is my grandma's cooking.

434
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:11,040
- Is it? 
 - Yes.

435
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:15,230
It's the taste of seasonings. My grandma's seasonings.

436
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,830
Grandma!

437
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,400
It's all good. It's good.

438
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,520
Don't cry. Don't you cry.

439
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,760
Don't cry.

440
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,000
I'm sorry, Grandma.

441
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,170
For what?

442
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:45,480
Just everything. You were really worried, weren't you?

443
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,510
My goodness, the two of you are here together now.

444
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:51,490
It's all good now that you're in front of me.

445
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:55,550
After I sent you away at the hospital,

446
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:59,160
I thought that may have been the last time, and that...

447
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,580
that thought...

448
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:09,440
If I knew you'd come back, I should have made your favorite food.

449
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,120
What do I even like?

450
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,980
You!

451
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,400
You always hated everything I made for you.

452
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:25,170
You said I would only make pickled side dishes.

453
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,260
How I pickled every single thing.

454
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,860
They last longer that way.

455
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:34,040
That's right. I never got to make you something delicious,

456
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:39,760
because I was always penny-pinching like that.

457
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:44,400
The pickled stuff was really delicious.

458
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:49,380
It didn't look good, but it always tasted really good.

459
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,920
I missed your food, Grandma.

460
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,350
- I wanted to eat it. 
 - My goodness!

461
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,410
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

462
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:02,300
Okay. What should I make for you, then?

463
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,750
Everything.

464
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,750
All right.

465
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,210
My baby.

466
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,630
Here.

467
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:25,030
So I drink this with water every morning?

468
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:30,820
Wake your body up in the morning by downing a glass of lukewarm water first.

469
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:35,730
Then slowly let out a big breath.

470
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:40,660
- Then you'll start feeling your blood circulating all across your body. 
 - I see.

471
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,540
- Okay. 
 - You got it?

472
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:47,540
Me too. Give me something to eat, too. You got better after eating this.

473
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,010
- Hold on. Hush. 
 - You got better though.

474
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:53,720
You're dressed up like a model. Don't be like this.

475
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,010
- Yes? 
 - Don't tell this to anyone and take it for yourself only.

476
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,190
What is this? What is it?

477
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:00,570
It's a cure for everything.

478
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:03,650
I'm only giving it to you, so take it regularly.

479
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:07,660
Then exercise for once and eat a little less, please.

480
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,640
- All right. 
 - You got it?

481
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,200
All right, all right.

482
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,370
Hurry on out.

483
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,960
What is that? Give it to me, too.

484
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,970
- Vitamins. 
 - What?

485
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:23,340
Vitamins!

486
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:28,600
Se Yeon.

487
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:40,360
I noticed that you have the same shoe size as me.

488
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,890
I bought these shoes here

489
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:49,570
after I was told I was terminally ill.

490
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:55,100
I used to only wear shoes with sleek heels.

491
00:35:55,100 --> 00:36:01,590
I don't know why I bought these shoes. It's so clumsy-looking with no heels.

492
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,720
Or maybe I do know.

493
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,420
They're so pretty.

494
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:15,650
I feel like I could go anywhere with these shoes on.

495
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:20,310
Yes, you can go anywhere.

496
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,550
Thank you.

497
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,900
What about me? I don't get anything?

498
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:28,710
Hey, I can't match up to your luxurious standards.

499
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,030
But this...

500
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:36,100
It was something my mom used.

501
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:41,080
She hated looking disheveled, so she used it until the very end.

502
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,360
It's so pretty.

503
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,230
- This is totally vintage. 
 - Yes!

504
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,320
Shall I take a look?

505
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:52,520
I think I look prettier than I usually do today.

506
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,070
Yes, you are pretty.

507
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:57,580
Keep telling yourself how pretty you are.

508
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,520
I feel a little less nervous now.

509
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,010
- It's time for Oppa to come now. 
 - I see.

510
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:09,260
I'm going to my in-laws... Gosh, it sounds awkward.

511
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:13,610
Anyway, I'm going to meet them for the first time.

512
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:16,330
Mi Do! What is going on?

513
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:20,100
- What? 
 - You didn't see the article yet?

514
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,120
Father!

515
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:28,330
Did you release that article?

516
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:31,010
Yes. I told you to end it.

517
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:34,260
I told you I will take care of it on my own!

518
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:38,660
Do you think the world is your oyster now that you got promoted?

519
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:44,050
The culprit she shares a room with is still on the run and she keeps coming up on related searches.

520
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:48,130
The people's interest in the serial murder still hasn't died down.

521
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:51,760
Now the company is getting roped in because of our business in supporting the hospice.

522
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,620
Marry? You're going to marry her though?

523
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:01,040
I didn't give you the company so that you could have your way with it. It's the exact opposite.

524
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,900
From now on, you have to think and move only for the company.

525
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:08,000
I'll be branded a complete scumbag if I end it like this.

526
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,690
There's no reason to take it this far with a girl who's dying.

527
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,360
Are you saying the timing is the issue?

528
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,130
Or is it your feelings that are the issue?

529
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:24,060
For me, these kinds of feelings might be love.

530
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,610
And Mi Do? What about Mi Do?

531
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:31,240
Do you really think marrying a guy like him would be a happy ending for Mi Do?

532
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:35,820
Marrying a guy like that without a clue and then dying?

533
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:39,810
Mi Do's life would be so sad then.

534
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:43,230
 Ji Pyo Oppa is next to me.

535
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:46,040
 He still stayed by my side even after I told him I murdered someone.

536
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,330
 He said he'll do whatever he can to help me.

537
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:50,990
 Do you know what that means to me?

538
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:54,160
Mi Do feels like she's being loved for the first time.

539
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,520
She tried her entire life to be loved. She believes in love now.

540
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:02,150
If that love falters, Mi Do will be destroyed.

541
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,600
 Hey! Hey, In Sook!

542
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,080
I somehow knew.

543
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,840
Turns out, it's today!

544
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,780
This is what being lucky means.

545
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:22,190
Grandma! You can't keep going in and out of here.

546
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:24,020
I think you have to head over to the restaurant now.

547
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:27,740
Oh, just a moment. Just a short moment.

548
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,110
What is this?

549
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:32,000
Eat it. It's good for your health.

550
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,020
- What medicine is it? 
 - My goodness!

551
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,860
It was so hard to get these!

552
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,230
Where did you get these from?

553
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,710
These are wild ginseng.

554
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:46,820
They said it's a new medicine made out of the roots of it.

555
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,470
An Oriental Medicine doctor made it.

556
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:54,190
It's become a huge deal because of its ability to help cure terminal cancer patients.

557
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,180
It wasn't easy but I got them!

558
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:59,120
You can no longer buy this for the amount I paid.

559
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,490
You paid for this?

560
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:04,780
Yes, of course, I paid money for it!

561
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,370
I got a good deal because he felt sorry for me.

562
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:11,350
With what money did you buy this?

563
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:14,730
I'm going to pay with our lease money.

564
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:16,260
- What? 
 - Gosh.

565
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,980
The newlywed woman is a very good person.

566
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:25,290
She knows my situation so she gave me all the lease money.

567
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:31,070
Try this.

568
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,440
Where's my car key?

569
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,520
My car key.

570
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,260
He's not picking up?

571
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,650
What is this? Tell me!

572
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:53,950
Why in the world did you do something so stupid like this?

573
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:58,120
I saw the clinic trial...

574
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:02,890
no, video of the clinical trial, too!

575
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:06,000
I'm telling you, there's really someone who got better from taking this.

576
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,560
I saw it!

577
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,760
How can someone get better when they have cancer?

578
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,060
If that's the case, who would die from cancer then?

579
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:15,590
That Sung Hae lady got better and is leaving, too!

580
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,880
Why can't that be the case for you?

581
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,720
Let's just try it, okay?

582
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,300
I shouldn't have come back.

583
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:34,910
I came back only to give you false hope.

584
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,550
Is that wrong?

585
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:05,360
- What? 
 - Is it wrong...

586
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:08,480
- to give a little sense of false hope? 
 - It's wrong.

587
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,520
Don't have any expectations.

588
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,810
That will only make it harder for me.

589
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:15,710
I'm already struggling as is to make myself give up.

590
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:18,580
Continuously expecting and wanting something like that.

591
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,410
I'm struggling so much to give all those up. So just don't!

592
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:24,690
Why would you give up? You can get better and we all—

593
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,720
You're driving me crazy, Grandma!

594
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,100
That's enough.

595
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:35,810
I would have done the same thing. Anyone would. It's because you love them.

596
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:38,440
They can't just let them go.

597
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,450
They want to do anything they can, or else they can't live.

598
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:43,520
At least if they do that,

599
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:48,260
they can endure it.

600
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:13,130
It's not the first time this has happened.

601
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:16,920
There were a lot of people and hospice patients who get scammed like this.

602
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:21,550
They bet their hopes on something like this because surgery isn't an option and there's little chance of being cured.

603
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:26,100
Those people are such jerks.

604
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:30,430
They'll have to experience generations of cancer and die the most painful death,

605
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:32,090
for them to come to their senses.

606
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:34,700
How could someone use a human being's life to scam another?

607
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,150
Someone is dying!

608
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,490
How could they do something like that?

609
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,760
That's why it makes them easier to be used.

610
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,530
People who are desperate will cling to anything.

611
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:45,610
That darn salesman who sold the medicine.

612
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:47,290
You don't think we can get a hold of him again, right?

613
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:51,740
I called that darn salesman, but his number didn't exist anymore.

614
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,660
He probably already ran away with the money.

615
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,200
Do you think we need to report it to the police?

616
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,930
The police don't get involved that easily.

617
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:08,430
Yes, thank you.

618
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,490
Bang Joon Seo's autopsy came out. It was a heart attack.

619
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:17,600
That man who was filming for his YouTube channel and his two companions,

620
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,960
he got a heart attack while getting into a physical altercation with them.

621
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,600
I'll have to announce the result of the investigation.

622
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:25,890
But the chief said we should catch Min Woo Cheon and  Pyo In Sook first—

623
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:28,820
I've requested protection for the second target on the murder list.

624
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,790
The people are telling us to hurry up and kill them.

625
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:32,200
They're very enthusiastic about it.

626
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,890
What am I going to do if you get booted for announcing with the chief's approval?

627
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:38,670
What else? You carry on with the job.

628
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:40,450
Gosh, stop talking nonsense.

629
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:42,760
Let's catch Pyo In Sook and Min Woo Cheon first.

630
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,070
- After that, yes? 
 - No.

631
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:47,550
Oh, come on!

632
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,980
- I feel offended. 
 - Offended about what?

633
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:53,370
I somehow feel very incompetent.

634
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,060

635
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,790
Give it another good thought, okay? Think about it.

636
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:02,950

637
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:07,380
 -Yes, Sister?  
 - Yes, Detective.

638
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,690
It's a bit of a personal request.

639
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:13,540
Could you maybe come to the hospice?

640
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:16,040
Well, if it's a personal request,

641
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,770
I'll have to do whatever I can to go.

642
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:20,370
Okay. I'll be waiting.

643
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:23,660
If you're waiting for me, I'll do my best to get there as soon as possible then.

644
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:26,080
Okay, thank you!

645
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,920
No, thank you. Goodbye.

646
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:31,400
Awesome!

647
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:35,840
Have you fallen in love again?

648
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,860
Gosh, what are you saying? I'm a nun!

649
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,340
I guess you are, right?

650
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:44,740
Even if I'm not a nun, I wouldn't fall for this detective.

651
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,650
- What the? You really sent it. 
 - Yes.

652
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:28,400
I'll start warming it up.

653
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,370
Let's meet them when they're all warmed up and get a deal in one go.

654
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:34,640
- Okay? 
 - Okay.

655
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,130
 Did she really get dumped?

656
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:44,470
 - Did Koo Ji Pyo dump her? 
 - You thought it could've been Sung Mi Do who dumped him?

657
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:47,090
 Who would marry a terminally ill person who's tied to a serial murder.?

658
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:49,330
 He's a chaebol of all things.

659
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:55,580
 I saw the article, Mi Do. I'm worried about you.

660
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:58,500
 You must be suffering both mentally and physically.

661
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,620
 - Hang in there, Mi Do!  
 - That's right.

662
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,210
This is how it normally is.

663
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:08,070
This is how people truly feel.

664
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:12,250
They may seem like they're all supportive,

665
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:14,500
but they were just hoping I would be destroyed.

666
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,670
They must be enjoying my misery.

667
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,900
Just turn off your phone.

668
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:32,180
Where are you going to go?

669
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,520
- I'm going to go see Oppa. 
 - Then what?

670
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,230
- I have to go to our meal together. 
 - What?

671
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:39,730
I was supposed to meet all his family for a meal today.

672
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:42,120
That's what I have to do.

673
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,900
I have to keep my promise.

674
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,330
No, wait. You have to assess the situation.

675
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:50,400
- Why it happened and what's going on— 
 - This is all because of In Sook!

676
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,570
There was a third murder after she ran away.

677
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:57,260
The serial murder won't stop, so I keep getting roped into it.

678
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,540
I have to go and explain to him.

679
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:03,470
We helped her. You wanted In Sook to be happy, too.

680
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:05,660
Yes, that's why I helped.

681
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:07,430
But even as I was helping her,

682
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:10,720
I was worried this may backfire on me.

683
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,230
Turns out I was right.

684
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:14,490
This all happened because I was hoping someone else would be happy,

685
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:18,190
without knowing my happiness was getting destroyed.

686
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:20,510
I have to get going.

687
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,730
You can't go like this!

688
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:40,650
Sung Hae, live a good life. Okay?

689
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:48,250
- Who am I going to hang out with once you leave? 
 - Hey!

690
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:52,230
You want her to die with us here or something?

691
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:55,640
This is good. I shouldn't cry.

692
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:12,210
Where's my grandma?

693
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:15,710
I don't know.

694
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:18,780
Why do you ask after getting so mad at her like that?

695
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:21,010
It's always like this.

696
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:23,460
What is?

697
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:28,600
I become sadder after I get mad at my grandma.

698
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:32,020
I get annoyed then I become sad.

699
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:35,350
That's why I can never win with her.

700
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:39,860
What's there to win or lose?

701
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:45,190
But that really was such a stupid thing to do.

702
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:50,770
Do you know the life my grandma lived?

703
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:53,410
She picked up trash every day.

704
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:57,530
Then she saved that money relentlessly and didn't use it.

705
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:00,250
Things like innerwear and cosmetics I bought for her with the money I saved...

706
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:04,600
she can't even use them because they're too precious.

707
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,160
She just keeps them in a safe place.

708
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:11,780
Not once in her life,

709
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:15,420
did she enjoy good stuff or food.

710
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:17,470
That's my point.

711
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,960
She lived her life without using a penny.

712
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,720
For you...

713
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:35,920
she handed over that large amount of money just to save you.

714
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:44,180
I have to see my grandma.

715
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:46,360
Shall we go out?

716
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:35,160
It's dark outside. Why don't you go once it's bright out?

717
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,550
Are you going to the hospital?

718
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:44,840
Yes.

719
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:49,420
I will have to wait for my death...

720
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:52,560
at the hospital now.

721
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:57,740
It would be nice if you stayed longer at the hospice.

722
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:01,060
Why don't you stay here and...

723
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:04,120
You know how it is.

724
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,920
I can't be in pain...

725
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,040
I can't break down...

726
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:15,490
I can't die.

727
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,260
I can't do any of those.

728
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,290
Woo Cheon and In Sook!

729
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:35,500
I thought I would go without seeing you two.

730
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,630
Why did you do that?

731
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:40,180
Why did you lie?

732
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:45,300
I...

733
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,390
I'm the hope...

734
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:51,510
of this hospice.

735
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,610
Hope.

736
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:02,570
Even while awaiting death,

737
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:05,290
people look ahead.

738
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:08,320
Until the very end,

739
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:11,810
they hang onto hope.

740
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:17,590
What's the point of all that?

741
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:19,800
False hope?

742
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,170
It only gives you greater despair.

743
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:28,090
Is there such thing as false hope?

744
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:30,720
Hope doesn't always

745
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:35,100
have to bring a good result.

746
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:39,060
It just becomes a source of strength,

747
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:43,960
for sick patients to get through this time.

748
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,170
This day,

749
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:50,470
just this one day.

750
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:56,570
If they spent this day that way, that's good enough.

751
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:10,070
Isn't that why the two of you are here, too?

752
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,660
- Why aren't you giving me crap about it? 
 - What?

753
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:57,530
I thought you'd be ripping into me for getting scammed.

754
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:09,180
- What is this? 
 - I told you I sold the store.

755
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:12,030
But why are you giving me this?

756
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:17,390
Tell the person you gave the house to about your situation and give the money back.

757
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:22,550
You liked this house, Mom.

758
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:27,530
It's because I always lived here.

759
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:31,950
After I took In Sook in,

760
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:34,270
we always stayed here.

761
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:41,760
I was trying to make something of myself back then.

762
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,510
I wanted to do something,

763
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:47,740
after I sent In Sook to you.

764
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:51,690
But I wasn't able to accomplish anything.

765
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:55,700
As it turns out, I don't know how to do anything.

766
00:55:55,700 --> 00:56:00,550
- You're good at singing. In Sook liked it, too. 
 - Really?

767
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:05,580
In Sook was always very good at singing.

768
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,540
She took after you.

769
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:09,990
Did she take after me?

770
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:14,810
Of course, she did. She came out of you!

771
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:33,410
My entire life...

772
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:37,910
I thought my life was pretty crappy.

773
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:42,010
Drinking and gambling his entire life.

774
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:48,240
After doing whatever I can to support that old geezer until his death...

775
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,860
there was you.

776
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:55,090
I worked until my back broke again until you got married.

777
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:58,550
I thought I would finally get a break.

778
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:01,690
But you suddenly brought In Sook over.

779
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:06,880
I thought it was my fate to take care of someone my whole life.

780
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,920
How sad...

781
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:14,170
my poor life is.

782
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:22,530
But it might've been those responsibilities that kept me alive.

783
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:29,260
What will keep me alive if I don't have my In Sook, too?

784
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:36,260
No. What's the point of me living if I don't have my In Sook?

785
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:39,510
That's what I think.

786
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:57,260
Have you seen a raft of otters sleeping?

787
00:57:57,870 --> 00:57:59,750
I haven't.

788
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,110
They hold their hands before they sleep.

789
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:08,270
They get swept around in the water as they sleep.

790
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:11,260
So they hold hands not to get separated.

791
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:25,280
This day...

792
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,770
 This day, just this one day.

793
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:33,240
Just this one day.

794
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,020
Mi Do.

795
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:59,750
This won't get erased.

796
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:01,350
Stop.

797
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:04,140
- Did you know? 
 - Know what?

798
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:08,600
Did you know those two were here?

799
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:17,800
 Entrance is denied?

800
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,760
 What is this?

801
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:54,070
 They were here?

802
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:59,720
How could they do that without even telling us?

803
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:09,900
- On whose accord? You can't just yet. 
 - We have to catch them right away.

804
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:12,310
Why are you being like this?

805
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:16,310
- Just because I was being nice to you— 
 - Someone else could end up dead.

806
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:18,570
You want me to hide the truth? I can't do this.

807
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:20,150
I never said we should hide it.

808
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:22,220
I'm saying there's a time for everything!

809
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:25,410
We need to cut off the serial murders. That's the first thing we should do.

810
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:28,300
If you enjoy working with Jo Si Yeong as a set that much,

811
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,990
I'll fire you too.

812
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:36,170
Pack your things up first if you're going to announce it.

813
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:09,130
 - Are you saying it's not a serial murder?  
 - Yes.

814
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:13,180
Then what about the first case, Ha Yong Geun. Then the second, Park Doo Jin's case?

815
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:15,430
Didn't you say that Pyo In Sook confessed?

816
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:18,630
We're planning to re-investigate everything.

817
01:01:56,490 --> 01:01:59,960

818
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:17,700

819
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:26,720

820
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,770
 Hello?

821
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:37,730
Oppa.

822
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:47,490

823
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:50,710
 - Do you love me, Oppa? 
 - Do you love me? Regardless of what kind of person I am?

824
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:52,760
 I'm saying, I'm not sure if he really loves you.

825
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,960
 You think only your love is so affectionate and desperate?

826
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,510
 - You think my love is a joke? 
 - Thank you.

827
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:59,830
 I heard death is impending once the pain subsides.

828
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:02,210
 - We're all going to die now. 
 - I want to live.

829
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:04,810
 Don't try to endure it. It's something we have to go through.

830
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:07,740
 The reason this all happened is in the video?

831
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,900
 What can you do with just that video?

832
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:12,150
 Is Sung Mi Do not related?

833
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:15,340
 - My goodness, we met again. 
 - Why are you here again?

834
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:17,930
 She has a reason to come.

835
01:03:18,790 --> 01:03:22,360
♫  I'll light the way for you  ♫

836
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,850
