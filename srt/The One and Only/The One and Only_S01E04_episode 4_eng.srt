1
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,970
What are you doing? Take it with you.

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,710
Why? All of a sudden?

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,990
For a second, I forgot that I was dying.

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,610
I think you find it amusing to bleed me dry,

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,220
but it's no fun for me.

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:24,530
Just one thing, leave the other two alone because I killed him.

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,100
Why did you do that?

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,490
I'm dying anyway. I just want to take someone with me.

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:37,230
I wanted to protect that child before I went.

10
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:45,540

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,950
Take it and get lost.

12
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,400
What are you talking about, all of a sudden?

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,470
I'm turning myself in. I killedâ€”

14
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,120
What's going on right now?

15
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,740
Oh my.

16
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,880
 Hand.

17
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,640
 If you grab someone's hand, they will let go.

18
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,460
 Mom.

19
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,100
 Mom.

20
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,880
 If you extend your hand, you get hurt.

21
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:17,930
 So you must never reach out for someone's hands.

22
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,580
 You can't hold anyone's hand.

23
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,800
 But I repeatedly make the mistake.

24
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,680
 I expect something.

25
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,380
 Because it is soft and warm.

26
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,750
 When I know that I'll get hurt.

27
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,330
 I know this, and I know I'll lose something again.

28
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,220
Oh my.

29
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,240
Are you crazy?

30
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,300
What are you doing?

31
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,990
Do you want to die?

32
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,500
Hey.

33
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,500

34
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,690
Crazy jerk.

35
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,820
Hey, what'll we do now?

36
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,940
The police arrested him.

37
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,110
- What? 
 - They come to arrest that jerk.

38
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,200
Why did you guys even kiss?

39
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,010
Never mind, that's not important right now.

40
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,810
But why? What happened?

41
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,870
What should we do? They came to arrest him.

42
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,000
I don't know what I'm more surprised by.

43
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,490
Why would you guys kiss out there?

44
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,020
They arrested him?

45
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,250
The police are here.

46
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,830
 Take it and get lost.

47
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,500
 What are you talking about, all of sudden?

48
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,630
 Where did this bastard go?

49
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,240
 I'm turning myself in.

50
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,170
Turn yourself...

51
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,370
There's been a change to our circumstances.

52
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,960
A variable is forming.

53
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,850
Feelings...

54
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,870
Director, what happened? Why did they arrest him?

55
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,710
Calm the patients and let them know he was taken in for questioning is all. Then send them all to their rooms.

56
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,510
Since Min Woo Cheon isn't here,

57
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,910
ask Miss Pyo In Sook and Sung Mi Do

58
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,690
to take care of Young Ji in his place.

59
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,230
Okay.

60
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,710
It's just a simple investigation. Don't worry.

61
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,070
And go to your room.

62
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,170
- What? 
 - Min Woo Cheon.

63
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,930
That's right, they were kissing just now.

64
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,900
Sorry? What kiss?

65
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,600
It was strange to see in a hospice.

66
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,620
In the middle, they were going...

67
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,380
People were staring at them but they didn't care at all!

68
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,360
This is first time I saw people kissing each other.

69
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,290
Was it okay?

70
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:08,520
But why would you run off like that after a kiss?

71
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,820
Who?

72
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,670
She's probably embarrassed!

73
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:18,010
If she ever kissed anyone again, she would die from embarrassment!

74
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,640
With who?!

75
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,420
- She's here. 
 - She's here.

76
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,170
Oh my.

77
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,220
They were like this.

78
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,000
How shocking.

79
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,300
How did they know to come here?

80
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,480
It must be my grandma that told them.

81
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,930
Since she said the police went to her house.

82
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,970
What are we going to do? Now that he's been caught, he'll testify against us.

83
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,150
He might not.

84
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,010
What are you talking about?

85
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,410
I'm turning myself in.

86
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,750
I was telling him that I'd turn myself in.

87
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,090
I didn't know the police were approaching from behind me.

88
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:25,750
I think he kissed me to make me stop talking.

89
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,220
Wait a minute. What?

90
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:32,520
He kissed you to protect you? How does that make any sense?

91
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,930
Today, Young Ji!

92
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,890
Sorry?

93
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:42,330
Don't forget to take care of Miss Young Ji later this evening.

94
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,550
Since Mr. Woo Cheon isn't here.

95
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,030
What's wrong with her?

96
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,550
What was that?

97
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,250
 So you saw a child collapse while passing by

98
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,110
 and brought her to a house with their light on.

99
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,730
The grandma in that house and the child had a lot of scars

100
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:13,170
- so you went to the pharmacy, bought them medicine, and left? 
 - Yes.

101
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,870
You were there around 9:12 in the evening, that neighborhood.

102
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,010
That house couldn't have been the only one with their light on.

103
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,250
So why was it that house in particular?

104
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,010
Just because... that was the first house I saw.

105
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,780
Why didn't you report to the police?

106
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,710
When I went to that house, it seemed like that grandma knew her.

107
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,600
She kept saying, "What a relief."

108
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,080
They both fell asleep soon after.

109
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,200
You didn't notice that the kid was holding a handphone?

110
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,760
What time did you discover the kid?

111
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,710
Probably around 9:30?

112
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:56,160
The child had fainted, and the father suddenly went missing, leaving the child behind.

113
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,360
You found and moved the child while he was gone.

114
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,640
 Then, someone killed the father once he returned,

115
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,410
if we want to force your claims together with the facts.

116
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,860
That must be it.

117
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,660
What time did you leave the house after giving them the medicine?

118
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,170
I don't know.

119
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:15,440
When I woke up after falling asleep, the rain had stopped. That's when I left.

120
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,080
The rain stopped around 11:00 p.m.

121
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,760
Someone planted a flower there after the rain stopped.

122
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,890
If you really left after the rain stopped,

123
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:34,960
the victim was already near the bridge, unconscious.

124
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,040
But you didn't see him lying there?

125
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,160
Is it fun?

126
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,730
Your expression changes when you look at those pictures of his corpse.

127
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:01,480
Must be fun, looking at dead people.

128
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,610
Innocent people usually get worked up and emotional.

129
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,970
He's way too calm. I tried using the pen technique.

130
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,070
- What? 
 - There.

131
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,740
I put some pens and other small things you can throw on the table.

132
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,530
- He won't touch them. 
 - What have you been watching recently?

133
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:28,560
Criminal: UK. Have you not watched it? It's quite good.

134
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,370
Will he spill or not?

135
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,800
The person who kissed him should know.

136
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,940
What nonsense is that?

137
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,120
- How was the feeling? 
 - Of what?

138
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,080
When you kissed him, how did it feel?

139
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,440
Did it feel sincere? If it was sincere, he won't snitch.

140
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,400
If it wasn't, then he'll spill immediately.

141
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:02,030
Hey, your face is blushing.

142
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:05,160
- No. 
 - Your face is red.

143
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,380
- It's not. 
 -"It's not".

144
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,710
- Are you stupid? 
 - It's not. I'm telling you, it isn't!

145
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,420
It's red.

146
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,020
If he does spill, let's go according to the plan.

147
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,330
- We can just put the blame on him. 
 - Sorry?

148
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:24,980
Oh? Are you hesitating now that you've kissed him?

149
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,740
Do you really think he did that to protect you?

150
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,520
- You liked it that much? 
 - Hey, youâ€”

151
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,430
Then what, we already planned to put the blame on him.

152
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,780
That's why you stole his wallet, isn't it?

153
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,550
- Will it work out that easily? 
 - Why not?

154
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,250
Do we have the face of a killer?

155
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:44,360
Then we'll say Woo Cheon killed someone with a golf club?

156
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,110
Why would we tell them about the golf club?

157
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,320
We can just say he... must've used something to knock him out.

158
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,810
No. Should we just say we saw the corpse?

159
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,450
Pinning the blame on someone else is quite complicated.

160
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,910
Worse circumstance, let's say I did it.

161
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,360
- No, that dayâ€” 
 - I know.

162
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,080
- What? 
 - I remember.

163
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,810
I'm the one that suggested it, and we did it together.

164
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:15,300
We have no choice but to let someone with the best chances take the blame.

165
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,200
I'm diagnosed with sleepwalking and have records of polysomnography.

166
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,380
- Unniâ€” 
 - I'm the only one

167
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,830
that could be released on extenuating circumstances.

168
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:33,190
I saw you're a volunteer at a hospice. Since when?

169
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:37,150
About the woman that you kissed at the hospice,

170
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:41,100
- what is your relationship? 
 - Why does it matter?

171
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,190
I just keep wondering why it had to be that house.

172
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,220
The daughter of the victim, Ha San Ah.

173
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,440
It turns out that she knew Pyo In Sook.

174
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,990
While searching the house, I found something.

175
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,090

176
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,250
Pyo In Sook.

177
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:13,680
After that, I found that name again.

178
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,150
Pyo In Sook.

179
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,630
 - What about your granddaughter? 
 - She went on a trip.

180
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:24,530
 When she comes home, she'll work at a company with a computer.

181
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,250
 She got that award when she was still in school.

182
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,040
 She's so incredible.

183
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,010
 In rain or snow, even if she was sick,

184
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,240
 she always went to school.

185
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,090
 Her resilience is something else!

186
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:43,010
 If you have resilience, you'll succeed in anything.

187
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,840
 It seems like she was close to San Ah.

188
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,770
 Yes, they were.

189
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:51,720
 She was usually never interested in anyone, but

190
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,150
 since this little one was so abused by her father,

191
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,990
 who would be able to ignore that?

192
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,190
 She would always watch their house

193
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,660
 and wake up in the middle of the night, to go check on their house.

194
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,490
But then I saw her there, at the hospice.

195
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,720
 Are you crazy?

196
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,950
I think at this rate, it does matter.

197
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,130
Are you waiting for him?

198
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,920
No.

199
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,160
You can't hide anything.

200
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,960
You're like Candy. 
  (T/N: from the Japanese cartoon, Candy Candy)

201
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,860
When you're lonely and sad, you can't cry because you don't have feelings.

202
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,510
- You don't have many faces. 
 - What do you mean?

203
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:50,920
You most often look unhappy. When you look happy,

204
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,470
it stands out because it's so rare.

205
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,930
He likes you. I knew it from the start.

206
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,140
How did you know?

207
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,670
I'm really good at things like that.

208
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,060
I pay more attention to other people's expressions.

209
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,070
If they like me, if they're interested in me.

210
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,090
I'm sorry about earlier.

211
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,220
I did it because I was jealous.

212
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,890
I couldn't stand that he liked you.

213
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:30,610
Yesterday, I slept with a man.

214
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,870
- What? 
 - Do you remember that man?

215
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,640
The one we met at my friend's party.

216
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,150
That man is a chaebol. The top of the top. 
  (T/N: chaebol - heir of family conglomerate)

217
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,970
Even girls better than me

218
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,220
want to sleep with him. He's that type of guy.

219
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,650
Of course, I liked him too.

220
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,900
But I'm nowhere near their league,

221
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:58,420
so I thought it was embarrassing to have expectations.

222
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,750
But he slept with me.

223
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,000
Then... isn't that a good thing?

224
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,800
When I woke up at dawn, he was gone.

225
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:11,320
Without a note or text.

226
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,900
He disappeared as if nothing had happened.

227
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,660
Crazy jerk.

228
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:27,520
I never thought he actually liked me.

229
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,150
Actually, I tried to convince myself he didn't.

230
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,150
I must've been afraid things would turn out like this.

231
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,460
Aren't you just like that?

232
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,580
What?

233
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,920
Aren't you afraid of being disappointed and getting hurt?

234
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:56,360
Organize all the items by type and clean items that need to be cleaned.

235
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,420
Make sure to properly record the history each item corresponds with on its tag.

236
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,900
- Sure. 
 - Oh.

237
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:07,310
- How come your room hasn't submitted anything for our bazaar? 
 - The what?

238
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:10,160
There are two main events at the hospice.

239
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,150
One is the bazaar, the other is a picnic.

240
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:18,060
- How meaningless. 
 - Patients donate items to the bazaar.

241
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,880
These are not simply objects, but the patient's history.

242
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,670
Whether it be sad or happy,

243
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:27,810
memories or scenes of certain times seep into our belongings.

244
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,290
We sell those moments.

245
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,950
Why do you do that?

246
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,250
The profits are used for something good.

247
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,830
For the future our children will live in.

248
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,950
I wish the world would end.

249
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:43,400
I kindly request you share some of your history.

250
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,590
We're not in that kind of situation?

251
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,990
What situation?

252
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:51,070
We're terminally ill, we're dying.

253
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:56,670
Everyone here is like that.

254
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,500
You can follow them to get their items.

255
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:16,790
What a deep sigh!

256
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,940
I'm not doing this because I want to.

257
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,300
They keep bossing me around because I'm a kid.

258
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,330
All right, fine.

259
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:32,610
Let's give him something. Time? Memories? I'll give them all to you.

260
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:43,680
I wore this during the grand opening of my shopping mall.

261
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,960
This sold out that day. Guess this won't do.

262
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,040
This one I bought from Paris.

263
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,130
Some man was selling things he made in the streets.

264
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,300
He gave off such artistic vibes, you know what I mean?

265
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,850
That man totally fell head over heels for me.

266
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,090
When you make a decision, please tell me.

267
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,290
Isn't this a wedding ring?

268
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:18,220
Yes. The ring is too big for me.

269
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,260
Did you lose a lot of weight here?

270
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,600
No, it's always been too big.

271
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,820
What? He proposed to you with the wrong size?

272
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:29,260
Still, it looks like it would be expensive.

273
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,410
Why don't you just sell it?

274
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,660
 Mom.

275
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,340
What's that?

276
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:09,360
I don't know, I never opened it.

277
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,280
Do you want to open it?

278
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:37,290
"You said you wanted to go to the swimming pool with Mom, didn't you?

279
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:41,690
Sorry I left without saying goodbye. Just wait 100 days.

280
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:46,050
Then when summer comes, I'll come to take you."

281
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,170
She didn't come.

282
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,100
Even though I waited,

283
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,140
she didn't come.

284
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:08,610
You happened to take that child, who collapsed under the bridge, to a house.

285
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,460
 After that, you went to volunteer at the hospice center,

286
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,260
but the granddaughter happened to be there.

287
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,930
He grabbed it.

288
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:28,950
People tend to see coincidence and call it fate.

289
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,660
When I was young, my dad attempted a murder-suicide.

290
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:38,860
It was the first day my family ate at a restaurant.

291
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,200
We ate a good dinner,

292
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,730
and I fell asleep in the car on the way home.

293
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:49,230
When I woke up, I smelled something strange.

294
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:55,340
The car was filled with smoke and my mom's eyes were closed.

295
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,470
I kept beating on the window because I couldn't breathe.

296
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:03,810
 Right when I gave up, thinking that this was how I would die,

297
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,190
that child appeared.

298
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:12,530
A girl smaller than me. That small child

299
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:17,510
broke the window with a rock and grabbed my hand.

300
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,590
That woman is that child.

301
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:24,870
I saw that child's photos in that house.

302
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:31,630
From the time she was a child until she became an adult, there was not a single photo of her smiling.

303
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:35,800
Her face was angry, but she looked sad.

304
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,010
So I wanted to meet her.

305
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:44,860
But then I saw her on a famous person's social media.

306
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:49,430
That famous person was at the hospice, so that's why I went.

307
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:53,140
She hadn't gone on a trip, she was there.

308
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,470
She was terminally ill.

309
00:23:58,450 --> 00:23:59,800
You have to get them when they're vulnerable.

310
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,380
- That's a paper cup. 
 - He just needs to hold onto something.

311
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:16,660
 Only two things appear on your record.

312
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:20,570
One is psychiatry, and one is murder.

313
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:24,030
That's the record of the strongest suspect who appeared at the scene of the murder.

314
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,330
Is this also a huge coincidence?

315
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,630
A psychopath murderer?

316
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,900
You know well. You're a psychopath.

317
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,290
I understand your conviction.

318
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,400
- Now you just need to bring evidence. 
 - Evidence?

319
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,920
Do you think that we won't have evidence?

320
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,910
We're asking because we know everything.

321
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,520
Here. Now, let's get talkingâ€”

322
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,240
What are we going to do with him?

323
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,070
Just wait here. I brought the wrong folder.

324
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,870
Hey, what are you doing?

325
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:16,640
If he hasn't come back yet, it means he snitched.

326
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,940
He won't snitch because he likes me? If I believe that and stay still in a situation like this, I'll get caught.

327
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,830
I forgot for a second, that my predictions are always wrong.

328
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:27,830
Why would he like me? It doesn't make sense.

329
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,310
So where are you going to go?

330
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,450
- The sea. 
 - Is the sea the answer when you're terminally ill?

331
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:40,450
Sis, you talked about The Green Ray that time.

332
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:44,400
I want to see that. You said that those who see the green ray,

333
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,980
can't be fooled by the feeling of love anymore.

334
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,580
You said that if that ray appears, it will make false hopes

335
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,350
and lies disappear.

336
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,280
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

337
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,170
Let's go together!

338
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,040
You're dragging a carrier in the middle of running away?

339
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,630
We don't know how long we'll be running for.

340
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,340
I'm just being well prepared.

341
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:16,270
Drag it quietly! Someone might hear.

342
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:24,230
He's given his statement and will not speak anymore.

343
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,290
How much of this can we believe?

344
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:29,340
It's all a lie. A work of fiction.

345
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:34,180
In this case, we have no choice but to let him go. We can't go over 24 hours.

346
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,300
Sergeant Oh Jin Kyu.

347
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:40,360
Don't interrupt my interrogations.

348
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:45,080
No, it's just that earlier when he grabbed the cup and started touching it,

349
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,780
the atmosphere completely changed. The timing seemed perfect.

350
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,690
Pyo In Sook.

351
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,900
Excuse me?

352
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,560
When he said he met that woman, he grabbed his cup.

353
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:02,740
That's what I'm saying! My strategy worked.

354
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,940
Have you found anything about how Min Woo Cheon and Ha Yong Geun are related?

355
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,860
How much have you investigated Ha Yong Geun's surroundings?

356
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:16,110
You haven't found the phone yet, have you? What about the results from forensics?

357
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,520
Do your job.

358
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:24,100
Yes, understood.

359
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,690
Am I supposed to do all that myself?

360
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,350
What is he going to do if I do all that?

361
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,860
Just sit back, act tough, and order others around? Do you think I can't do that?

362
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:48,480
I'm going to humble him. No,

363
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,210
I'm going to crush Jo Si Yeong.

364
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,510
Who? Hyungnim, what's going on?

365
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,310
If there's something that I can help you with...

366
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:00,230
Do you know him?

367
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,530
 Sugar or cream?

368
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:12,260
I have a hunch about him, but I can't find information on him.

369
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,790
Is he the culprit?

370
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:19,400
No, there's something there. There's definitely something.

371
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,730
But we have no evidence. Look at him. Do you know him?

372
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:25,390
Maybe from the gambling centers that Ha Yong Geun frequented?

373
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:29,810
Something like that.

374
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,510
- Hey. 
 - Yes.

375
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:36,060
Send out all of your guys and round up everything connecting him to Ha Yong Geun.

376
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,670
I don't do secret investigation on people anymore.

377
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,840
Don't lie to me, punk.

378
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,860
I know that's your main stream of revenue.

379
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,800
Yes. Well, I'll look into it.

380
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,870
No. Bring it in no matter what.

381
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,570
Yes.

382
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,160
What's up?

383
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,060
We were supposed to look after Young Ji.

384
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,220
An hour has passed.

385
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,840
- What do we do? 
 - Whatever... someone else will take care of it.

386
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,190
We're about to get arrested for killing someone; why does that matter?

387
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:21,690
Where should we go? Which sea? Put it in!

388
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,790
These kinds of things are done by intuition.

389
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:26,760
Where do you have to go to see the green ray?

390
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,360
Isn't it hard to see?

391
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,170
Try and search it!

392
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,090
I like the western sea...

393
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:38,190
Young Ji said that she wanted to see the sea.

394
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:44,020
If Young Ji dies, does that mean I killed another person?

395
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,720
No. If it already happened, what can we do by going back?

396
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,450
We have to go back. We need to.

397
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:11,710
Mom! Mom! Mom!

398
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:15,710
Mom! Mom!

399
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:22,650
Ji Hoo, your mom needs to hurry to the hospital.

400
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:25,480
I'll go with her, so you wait here.

401
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,750
Okay?

402
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,030
My mom might die because of me.

403
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:57,140
I slept. Since I fell asleep...

404
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,660
If my mom dies...

405
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:08,720
What'll I... What'll I do?

406
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:15,130
It's okay. Your mom will be okay.

407
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:19,130
Where exactly did you go?

408
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:23,380
This little one fought off her sleep trying to stay awake.

409
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,760
I didn't see you guys that way.

410
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,550
She's asking you where you went.

411
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:31,550
Sis, is that what you want to know?

412
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,400
I don't even want to know...

413
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:37,860
- Let's go. 
 - She said she doesn't want to know.

414
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,290
Min Ji!

415
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:54,570
Dad!

416
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,220
Min Ji!

417
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,600
Thank you.

418
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:16,110
Me doing this is my final warning.

419
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:20,100
You know that we have to keep our promises, right?

420
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,170
I saw Baek Gu.

421
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,850
I was really curious about him before, and I saw him.

422
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:32,730
It was him, the psycho!

423
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:35,080
He got caught.

424
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,660
You knew, didn't you.

425
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:52,390
- Seriously. 
 - She's watching.

426
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,080
You should've told me sooner.

427
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,760
He'll be released because there's no evidence.

428
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,790
- He'll be released soon. 
 - Yes.

429
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:09,320
Since they can't catch him without evidence.

430
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:20,330
So, make some evidence.

431
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:24,040
Or make him turn himself in. We can't get caught because of him.

432
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:29,220
Baek Gu leads to you and you lead to me, then my superiors. We're all screwed!

433
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,620
Listen up.

434
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:36,480
I understand this will be a blow to your business, but you need to cut him off now.

435
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:42,140
Just figure out what happened to the phone and return the money.

436
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:28,770
They want you to take responsibility and end it.

437
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:33,690
What about the phone?

438
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,750
I don't know.

439
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:39,900
What? You don't know?

440
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,030
I'll find it.

441
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,730
It must be important to them.

442
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:51,620
I wonder what will happen if I have it.

443
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,780
- Woo Cheonâ€” 
 - Do you...

444
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,160
hope I take responsibility for this, too?

445
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,610
No.

446
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:11,100
That can't happen since you didn't kill him.

447
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:16,260
She's the ones that killed him, Pyo In Sook.

448
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,340
You should take care of this or you'll be in danger.

449
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:27,150
Everything will be fine if you just hand her over, and wrap this up.

450
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,560
Does she have the phone?

451
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,020
Brother.

452
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,530
Tell me.

453
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:44,600
This dog was a straggler. Someone must've abandoned him.

454
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:49,710
People threw rocks at him because he was dirty, smelly, and had patchy fur.

455
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:54,870
I took him in just before they put him to sleep at the shelter.

456
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:58,200
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

457
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,000
But when I brought him home,

458
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,060
he started doing all sorts of things, destroying the house.

459
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:10,540
He would constantly growl. "Why is he acting this way?"

460
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,530
I wondered this for a while.

461
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:20,470
Then I understood. The reason he was acting problematic at home

462
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,100
when he would behave in the shelter or at hotels...

463
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,870
is because he didn't want to lose that happiness ever again.

464
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:32,540
He exploded in obsession and possessiveness.

465
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,990
Brother.

466
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,450
Don't bother her.

467
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:45,130
I might explode if you do.

468
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:59,570
Looking at the sky makes me scared that my mom will be going there.

469
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,040
I'm sorry.

470
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:12,510
I knew my mom was going to die.

471
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:17,960
But if she dies while I was sleeping that would be sad and scary.

472
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:24,360
I might not be able to sleep for the rest of my life either, like Woo Cheon.

473
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:31,110
That won't happen.

474
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:36,710
My mom said this before...

475
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:42,440
that watching me asleep made her feel the most safe.

476
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:48,330
So if you can't sleep because of some stupid thoughts like that,

477
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:53,730
you mom won't feel at ease.

478
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:02,730
I wish I had more time.

479
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,300
It would be nice if I could hold her one more time

480
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,920
and make her laugh again.

481
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,800

482
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,940
Ji Hoo, you were worried weren't you.

483
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:32,660
She's smiling. That means she's alive, right?

484
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,870
The director would be smiling even if she were dead.

485
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,670
Mom!

486
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,830
Hi, Ji Hoo.

487
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:48,120
Are you okay?

488
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,890
I'm okay.

489
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:02,620
Ji Hoo, my Ji Hoo.

490
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:05,850
It's nice to see you.

491
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,130
 Mom!

492
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:28,090
 Mom! Get it together!

493
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:31,650
 Mom! Get up!

494
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:36,470
 Help me! Help me!

495
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,230
 Mom!

496
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,920
 Call the ambulance. Please!

497
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,490
 Mom!

498
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:46,500
 Mom! Mom!

499
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,230
 Mom!

500
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:52,310
 Woo Cheon you know how the world is.

501
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:55,830
 There's a circle drawn around you. I'm the one

502
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,780
 that entered the circle to save you.

503
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:02,650
 Enough. Just hand her over and wrap everything up.

504
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:12,490
Let's drink, like nothing happened.

505
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,940
It's such a relief that she's alive.

506
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,010
Exactly.

507
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:25,160
Everything seems okay now that we know Young Ji is alive.

508
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,090
What should we do now?

509
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,330
Run away again?

510
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,560
Let's stay like this for a bit.

511
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,430
I've been wanting to do this.

512
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:40,530
Just drinking coffee and talking with someone, just resting.

513
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:43,140
You haven't been able to do that before?

514
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:47,160
I wasn't able to.

515
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:53,120
There's just so much that I don't know about the world. There's so much I have yet to learn,

516
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,720
but I'm going to die in my youth.

517
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,180
I hate the word "youth."

518
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:02,060
My youth was a mess.

519
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,560
I was turned down from part-time jobs at cafes

520
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,080
because I wasn't pretty enough and didn't suit their image.

521
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,730
There was nothing I could do.

522
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:16,590
After searching so much, I become a body scrubber.

523
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:23,820
I spent my youth scrubbing bodies to make a savings account, only to throw that all to hospice before dying.

524
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,580
This is my youth.

525
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,090
At least you're ending it with a bang.

526
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:30,890
You killed someone and found love.

527
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:34,890
Be quiet, someone might hear you.

528
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,140
I thought I would just die here...

529
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,300
Oh, you're still going?

530
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,700
New things keep happening.

531
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,950
I get to share my thoughts with others.

532
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:53,270
I've made something similar to friends

533
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:56,400
and talk about myself to them.

534
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,220
Woo Cheon appeared.

535
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:02,410
You might be right.

536
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:04,680
I've never dated anyone,

537
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,200
so I keep finding significance in insignificant things.

538
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,350
I only said that because I was angry.

539
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:12,280
Small things.

540
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,790
I keep thinking about small things.

541
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:19,300
His expression, his gaze...

542
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,750
  Iâ€” you...

543
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:24,430
I know it's a ridiculous delusion,

544
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:26,930
but I keep thinking about it regardless.

545
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,960
What if...

546
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:33,390
I keep thinking, what if.

547
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:36,960
For some reason, I feel like...

548
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,150
Woo Cheon will come.

549
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,390
 Baek Gu!

550
00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:59,630
Get him!

551
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:05,190
Get him! Get him!

552
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:11,090
Grab him! That bastard!

553
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,660
 Hey!

554
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:06,030
Ji Hoo, you must've been so scared.

555
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:09,600
Don't worry too much. Mom's going to be okay.

556
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,560
I have something to show you.

557
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,390
What is it?

558
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:24,470
Because Mr. Woo Cheon isn'tâ€” he might not come,

559
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:28,530
I thought this might be his goodbye.

560
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:39,900
 You're not in this world right now.

561
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,180
 Probably.

562
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:46,430
 Soon, I'll disappear from this world, too.

563
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:51,160
 I don't have any pictures of me smiling.

564
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,300
 I'll take a picture for you.

565
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,120
 A pretty one.

566
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,800
 I know what that feels like.

567
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,880
 Not being able to be like other people.

568
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,350
 I knew since I was young.

569
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:15,020
 When the straggler bird leaves its herd for the skies,

570
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,140
 I wanted to lend it

571
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,070
 my strength.

572
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:58,210
Hey.

573
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:01,650
Hey!

574
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,060
You're sleeping way too long.

575
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,830
Petty.

576
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:10,750
What?

577
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:13,730
Getting me from the back like that, that's unfair.

578
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:20,100
Is it not unfair to do this from the front?

579
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,460
What did you do with the phone?

580
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:31,690
You didn't mess that up too, did you?

581
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:39,000
That's it, isn't it? The thing you're afraid of.

582
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,310
What I planned on doing was actually quite simple.

583
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:49,670
I could make evidence and chase you with it.

584
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:55,000
But... for your benefit, I'm suggesting you turn yourself in.

585
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,460
Your circumstances can be considered extenuating.

586
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:03,640
I'll make sure you only spend about 2 years in jail.

587
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,920
I own a dog.

588
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:08,800
What?

589
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,450
Who'll take care of the dog?

590
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,800
Hey!

591
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:06,140
Are you okay?

592
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:13,040
What happened? Are you okay?

593
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:17,610
What do I do?

594
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,710
Just eat one bite.

595
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:45,630
That's right.

596
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,510
That's from a sashimi knife.

597
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:50,020
Sashimi?

598
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,330
Did he get kidnapped and tortured?

599
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:55,160
Who gets tortured nowadays?

600
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,180
Oh, no!

601
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:07,650
But why aren't you asking me anything?

602
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:11,020
Why would we ask?

603
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:13,520
I was kidnapped and came back.

604
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,960
What I did, what happened...

605
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,320
You were able to come back because it wasn't a big deal.

606
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,500
We assumed you got scammed or something.

607
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,960
Does it hurt?

608
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,750
Should I hug you?

609
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:35,280
See? He didn't snitch.

610
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,130
He didn't get framed, either.

611
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:40,370
For now, he escaped.

612
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:43,590
Why is his face like that? What happened?

613
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:45,970
- I don't know. 
 - You don't know?

614
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:48,230
What on earth happened to him?

615
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:52,430
I can't even ask anything because there are so many people here.

616
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,670
Excuse me!

617
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:59,610
Shouldn't we give him some space?

618
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:05,440
As you all know, these two still have some things unresolved.

619
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,360
Oh, right! Right!

620
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,940
You only made so much progress.

621
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,480
Sure, sure. Do what you want.

622
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,860
Come back soon.

623
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,470
I don't know if we should just leave.

624
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:34,750
Shouldn't we go in and check?

625
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:36,720
Should we?

626
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:40,800
Why are you going in?

627
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,160
Follow me.

628
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,840
What happened?

629
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,640
Did you not snitch?

630
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:02,370
- Why? 
 - Just because.

631
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:09,940
What did the police say?

632
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:13,010
They couldn't find other evidence,

633
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:14,750
and he looked for the phone.

634
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:17,660
- Why? 
 - It seemed important.

635
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,640
Is my grandma in danger?

636
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,820
Grandma?

637
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:25,350
Never mind.

638
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:32,680
Did those people really do this?

639
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:36,350
- I fell. 
 - Does that make sense?

640
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:39,130
I fell really hard.

641
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:44,440
I like it when you

642
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:47,260
look at me like that.

643
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:51,670
- What? 
 - People don't stare at each other often.

644
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:53,700
But you look at me like that.

645
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,960
Nobody ever looked at me like that.

646
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:03,690
Whenever I couldn't hear very well,

647
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:07,010
- I gained the habit of looking at peoples' faces. 
 - Then it's a good thing.

648
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:12,190
But I see things I don't want to see. Peoples' expressions hold a lot.

649
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,230
Your expression...

650
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:19,870
is all sad.

651
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:24,510
So I keep getting caught off guard.

652
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:32,100
 The superiors have heard about it.

653
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:36,760
 I was going to get rid of him myself.

654
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:39,340
He makes things so complicated.

655
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:42,600
Get that bastard right now!

656
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,170
Or else, you're next.

657
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:47,670
Hyungnimâ€”

658
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:03,480
Pyo In Sook.

659
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,100
I don't know why you came to that neighborhood that day.

660
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:10,820
You were too calm.

661
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:15,160
Your gaze on me was weird. Like it wasn't the first time.

662
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,260
And you came here to find your wallet.

663
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:23,040
And then you were arrested by the police and came back in this mess.

664
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,830
Something's strange.

665
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:28,220
I keep thinking something's strange.

666
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:31,240
But I keep trying to cover my suspicions.

667
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:37,280
I killed a person. And I'm dying.

668
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,250
But I keep forgetting that, too.

669
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:45,690
I'm scared of myself.

670
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,730
I'm scared of myself, too.

671
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:56,550
My mom liked the rain a lot.

672
00:53:57,590 --> 00:54:02,040
That's why my name is Woo Cheon. Because I was born in rain. 
  (TN: woocheon- rain)

673
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,860
Maybe that's why...

674
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:07,930
I like rainy days, too.

675
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:11,380
I feel like a worm.

676
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:14,700
I can't look outside of my own circle,

677
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:17,920
and have to wriggle inside it.

678
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:21,900
I lived like that.

679
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,110
Because that's safest.

680
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,870
But...

681
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:31,410
now I keep trying to crawl out of that circle.

682
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,690
Because you're there.

683
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:40,290
I'll probably get stepped on and die.

684
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:44,080
But I can't go back into the circle.

685
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:48,920
So I'm scared, too.

686
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,010
Hey.

687
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,630
Did I sleep here?

688
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:26,450
Yeah. What were you doing to fall asleep here?

689
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:27,930
Talking.

690
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:29,800
- Just talking? 
 - Yeah.

691
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,330
Where's Woo Cheon?

692
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:42,740
Hey, I got a signal on the phone.

693
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:48,280
Together? Let's take my car.

694
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:52,300
Why won't he answer me?

695
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,840
 What did the police say?

696
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:09,410
 They couldn't find any more evidence

697
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:11,220
 and they looked for the phone.

698
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:14,290
 Is my grandma in danger?

699
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,870
Do you have any soju left?

700
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:21,320
Why again?

701
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:29,040
Why do you keep searching for soju nowadays?

702
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,890
Is something wrong?

703
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:34,740
What could be wrong at this age?

704
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:37,450
Something's wrong.

705
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:40,270
Jeez, so unlucky.

706
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:43,470
Nothing's wrong.

707
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:19,450
Oh, my. I almost forgot.

708
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:23,220
Hello, Ma'am. Are you feeling better?

709
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:27,090
Why is your face like that?

710
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:29,960
- I fell overâ€” 
 - You didn't fall over.

711
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,730
You got beat up somewhere.

712
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:34,590
What are you doing here?

713
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:37,210
I left something here.

714
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:38,530
What?

715
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:40,750
Have you seen my phone?

716
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:44,600
Why is everybody looking for a phone?

717
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,540
- Who? 
 - The police.

718
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:50,750
Oh, right. Didn't the police come looking for you?

719
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:53,670
They were asking around.

720
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:56,750
Yes, well. They asked me some questions.

721
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:01,150
Come in and look. Come in.

722
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:11,180
The signal is close to the murder scene.

723
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:17,940
Hey! Good thing you came.

724
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:21,260
Do you have anything to eat at home?

725
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:22,930
Take this and eat it.

726
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:26,180
You left that day without letting me thank you.

727
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:29,160
I felt bad, so take this.

728
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:33,100
It's a proper meal if you eat it with some rice.

729
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:36,420
Why did you make so much?

730
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:39,510
For my granddaughter.

731
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:41,050
I thought she went on a trip.

732
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:44,440
That's right, she left.

733
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:49,720
She went on a trip, but apparently she got lost.

734
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:54,170
If she got lost, someone will need to be there with her.

735
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,760
Somebody will be there.

736
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,200
That's right.

737
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:04,780
She went to travel, but I made so much.

738
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:08,710
When you're old, you have too many thoughts.

739
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:12,540
Then I have to move, but I moved too much.

740
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:14,820
This is good meat.

741
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:17,300
Try it. It's delicious.

742
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:20,890
- It's too much for me. 
 - Eat lots!

743
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:24,570
Share it with your girlfriend.

744
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:27,230
Don't you have a girlfriend?

745
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:29,270
- I do. 
 - Yeah, see!

746
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:32,800
Right, everybody has one nowadays.

747
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:37,970
I hope In Sook finds a pretty guy just like you

748
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:40,500
in Singapore and brings him back.

749
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,840
- I'm pretty? 
 - You're pretty!

750
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,430
Haven't you heard that before?

751
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:49,170
- I haven't. 
 - You're pretty.

752
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:51,980
Your eyes.

753
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:54,060
My eyes?

754
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:58,460
Hey. You couldn't find your phone?

755
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:09,180
Hey. The signal cut out. What should we do?

756
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:11,330
We'll look a little more.

757
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:39,150
Hello. You're Pyo In Sook, right?

758
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:45,490
- Who..? 
 - I'm Woo Cheon's older brother.

759
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:52,020
Woo Cheon is looking for you. He said it was something urgent.

760
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:55,060
Where is Woo Cheon right now?

761
01:01:55,060 --> 01:02:00,140
He's outside. This way.

762
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:15,120
Please get in.

763
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,740
What?

764
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:18,690
Where on earth is Woo Cheon?

765
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:21,170
That is...

766
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:27,450
If we go just a little ways...

767
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:33,290
Noâ€” no. I'll wait here.

768
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:41,890
Stay still! Stay still.

769
01:02:41,890 --> 01:02:44,790
Be quiet.

770
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:24,340
 Woo Cheon, let's figure things out. Otherwise, you're in danger.

771
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:29,200
 If you give me the girl and close the case, things will be over.

772
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,620
 Does she have the phone, too?

773
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:06,970
Who are you? Where are we going?

774
01:04:06,970 --> 01:04:09,720
- The police station. 
 - What?

775
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,010
You killed him.

776
01:04:12,010 --> 01:04:15,200
- Turn yourself in. 
 - Are you police?

777
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,880
If you don't turn yourself in, Woo Cheon will be in danger.

778
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:25,220
Woo Cheon was going to kill him, but you got there first!

779
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:30,510
- What? 
 - Didn't you know? That's his job.

780
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:35,270
Killing people. Contract killing.

781
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:40,230
Where is the phone? Woo Cheon came here to look for it.

782
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:42,910
If we can't find it, we're all dead.

783
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:46,360
 What the hell?

784
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:49,360
 - Give it. My wallet. 
 - You came all this way to find that?

785
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,960
 How did you know I was here?

786
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,350
 Who are you? Why are you here?

787
01:04:54,350 --> 01:04:55,860
 Are you crazy?

788
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:58,420
 He looked for the phone.

789
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:13,460
Where is the phone?

790
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:21,540
Stay still!

791
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:25,530
Stay still!

792
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:33,590
Stay still, damn it!

793
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:41,980
Hey, stop!

794
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:48,720
Damn it.

795
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,350
Seriously.

796
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:20,900
Stop it. Stop here.

797
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:24,130
Let's end it here. Why are you doing this?

798
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:27,320
I told you not to touch her. I might explode.

799
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:31,510
Woo Cheon, I'm doing this for you.

800
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:36,040
At this rate, you'll die! She needs to die for you to live.

801
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,620
Woo Cheon!

802
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,620
Move.

803
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:55,970
 In the end,

804
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:02,950
 if I extend my hand, I'll be the one falling over.

805
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,090
You sick bastard.

806
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:22,670

807
01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:29,460
â™«  A long night  â™«

808
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:32,780
 The One and Only

809
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:35,900
 We found DNA that might be linked to the suspect on the corpse.

810
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:37,440
 He said the police are looking for it.

811
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:39,630
 The only people who know that the phone is in Grandma's house

812
01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:42,100
 - are us. 
 - What's in that phone?

813
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:44,150
 I have all our client information.

814
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:45,530
 Then maybe I'll be the one to die.

815
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:48,860
 They've become a massive sponsor of our hospice center.

816
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:50,270
 - Aren't we friends? 
 - What friends?

817
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:52,140
 Is there someone you're not supposed to like?

818
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:53,910
 - Let's divorce. 
 - You think that will work?

819
01:08:53,910 --> 01:08:56,510
 It was all a lie. Why did you live like that?

820
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:58,840
 Keep watching over him. He'll try to live.

821
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:00,640
 I didn't have a reason to live.

822
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:03,880
 But I found a reason.
