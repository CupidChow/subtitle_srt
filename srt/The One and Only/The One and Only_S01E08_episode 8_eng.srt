1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,340
 This is pretty.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,620
 Picnic.

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,610
 Oh my.

4
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:08,350
 The highlight of a picnic is the night before.

5
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,400
 I said I don't like that.

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,490
 A picnic to me is a memorial day.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:26,980

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,270
 - His dad tried to kill them all. 
 - He did it so he can die with them.

9
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,590
 On a certain bright day, all of us almost died.

10
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,280
 If that happened, it would have been a long picnic.

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,510
 The kimbap Grandma makes are big and ugly.

12
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:56,450
 She puts a lot of healthy burdocks and the color also looks dull.

13
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,770
 Nobody ate my kimbap.

14
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,390
 I didn't know it back then.

15
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,340
 A picnic is one of the things that end in childhood...

16
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,640
 and that if I were to go to a picnic again,

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,410
 it somehow might be the last.

18
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:23,320
 Picnic. Going somewhere.

19
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,030
 Getting away from your daily life.

20
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:30,690
 Departure. Rest.

21
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,900
 Death.

22
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,780

23
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,970
My mom's favorite movie even back from she was a child was "The Smurfs."

24
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,410
Other animated movies were either scary or sad so she couldn't watch those.

25
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:57,480
Although there is a villain called Gargamel in "The Smurfs," he always lost against the four Smurfs.

26
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,390
That's why she was able to believe there will be a happy ending someday.

27
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,270
She was able to watch the animation peacefully.

28
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:13,770
Although Mom has gone to Heaven, I think of it as a happy ending.

29
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,680
Young Ji had a plan all along.

30
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,160
But how come I'm a bridesmaid?

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,500
What should I have for my funeral? Will you do Transformers for me?

32
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,420
By the way, you and Woo Cheon really look good together.

33
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,930
Your dress is also really pretty.

34
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,760
I heard that this is what Young Ji wore at her wedding.

35
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,160
We still have to do a detailed analysis but judging from the loft angle, there's a high chance of a match.

36
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,000
This hair is from the owner of the golf club, right?

37
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,840
- Yes. 
 - If the DNA matches, does that mean you have the culprit to the "Moss Rose Case"?

38
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,710
It will become an important link.

39
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,180
- The police? 
 - Yes.

40
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,450
That detective guy came.

41
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,510
He asked if it's true that I threw the cellphone away

42
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,250
or if I gave it to you.

43
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,750
- And? 
 - Of course, I didn't tell him.

44
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,180
Does the police know it's you?

45
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,560
It will end soon.

46
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,650
What will?

47
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,190
You won't have to lie anymore.

48
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,510
What does that mean?

49
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,080
Are they taking you? Are you going to prison?

50
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,440
I don't know about that.

51
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,770
But a wrongdoing is a wrongdoing, and there's always a consequence to our actions.

52
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,800
Unni!

53
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,360
San Ah.

54
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,820
I hope that you'll feel at ease.

55
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,340
What about the wrong things my dad did to me?

56
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,990
What about those?

57
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,380
In Sook!

58
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,230
Why?

59
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,130
 The identity of the victim of the "Moss Rose Case"

60
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,950
 is being randomly spread on the internet and is expected to create a wave.

61
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:24,800
 The child in the video uploaded by Victim Ha on the children sexual exploitation website Hello Video

62
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,630
 is assumed to be Ha's child and is shocking everyone.

63
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:33,550
 In addition to that, Ha has been revealed to have six counts of previous convictions including domestic abuse and gambling.

64
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,010
San Ah's picture is also being circulated.

65
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,460
How can they spread this kind of picture?

66
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,460
Seriously...

67
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:45,040
By the way, that site is really crazy. They even have videos of two and three-year-olds.

68
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,890
There are all kinds of videos and there are a lot of people who download and watch them.

69
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:55,110
There are organizations that kidnap children and film these types of videos, too.

70
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,640
The person who managed that and earned hundreds of millions got caught

71
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,970
but he was only imprisoned for a year then he got out.

72
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,320
Will San Ah be okay?

73
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,240
She'll overcome it

74
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,910
because it's not San Ah's fault.

75
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:14,090
By the way, he's really trash among trash.

76
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,270
But what is this?

77
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,650
 Good way to get rid of the trash.

78
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,610
 This is what you call a country.

79
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,830
 Wow. It's better than the law.

80
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,080
 The culprit of the "Moss Rose Case" is a great person.

81
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,530
 It was a good deed to kill that bastard.

82
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,140
 Is nobody going to kill those with electronic anklets?

83
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,530
 A personal punishment is needed.

84
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,040
 Kill them all!

85
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,020
The reactions are crazy. They're saying it was good he was killed.

86
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,570
That's right. That's why we killed him.

87
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,440
To just clean up one trash before we die.

88
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,840
There are so many comments under articles of the Moss Rose Case.

89
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,060
It's the most searched in real-time.

90
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,230
At this rate, won't they write it off as justified even if you get caught?

91
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,790
What happened with the DNA analysis?

92
00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:00,130
Considering how nothing has happened to you yet, it should be okay. Right?

93
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,440
But if it's not yours, whose DNA is it?

94
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,640
Wouldn't it be yours or mine?

95
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,490
 The police came.

96
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:26,620
 They asked your husband if something happened on that day, on visitation day.

97
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:32,220
 They said it's connected to a murder case. It's nothing, right?

98
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,230
 It's just an investigation for formality.

99
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,310
 That's right. Why would you be linked to that?

100
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,720
 But your mother-in-law aggressively said that you tried to kill her.

101
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,650
 How can a person be like that?

102
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:52,160
 I was in that house for a short time but I felt so suffocated.

103
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,840
 I'm sorry.

104
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,450
 Whether I didn't know or I was pretending I didn't,

105
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:12,770
 the fact that you're having a hard time and enduring it,

106
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,600
 that you're living reluctantly.

107
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,760
 In the end, I made the choice.

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,540
 I also thought it was a safe bet, just living the way I did.

109
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,020
 But, Mom,

110
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:38,440
 living as I did was actually the hardest.

111
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,010
 My daughter, what should I do?

112
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,090
 What should I do for you?

113
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,740
 I want a divorce.

114
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,510
 Sure. Get a divorce.

115
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:00,820
 I met Yoon Seo.

116
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,940
 Who?

117
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,950
 Don't you remember?

118
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,170
 She's my divorce attorney.

119
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,120
 What? How is she—

120
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,440
 That time, because of her, you took time off school—

121
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,980
 No. It's not because of Yoon Seo.

122
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,420
Hey, hey. The reporters are outside. Where do you think you're going?

123
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,090
Please request a restraint to the victim's identity leak

124
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:44,160
and ask help from the cyber investigation team to find out where the leak started.

125
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,510
The public opinion is no joke.

126
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:49,560
The killer has become a hero so I don't know whether they want the culprit caught or not.

127
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,480
I'm thinking that we should join forces at times like this and...

128
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,870
You should answer...

129
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,850
Don't you think he's going out so he can be in front of the camera?

130
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,840
Why do you keep looking at that guy's private detective agency?

131
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,680
 As long as I have this, they won't give up that easily.

132
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,840
 We have to find out what's in here. Please do it, Hyung.

133
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,250
 What happens when we find out?

134
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,260
 You have to find out '1''s identity.

135
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,550
 The higher-ups' weakness is definitely in this.

136
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,620
 Since I'm at it, I'll threaten you as well.

137
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:45,830
 Evidence related to Narae Cleaning Service is connected to a contract killing service is with me. What do you want to do?

138
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:50,160
 Do you want to stick to their side and die or be on my side and live?

139
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,680
Whatever.

140
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,840
Why did the police go to your house?

141
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,720
The golf club is the murder weapon and it's my husband's.

142
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,550
I sleepwalk and I have a diagnosis for it.

143
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,150
In the worst-case scenario, if we say I'm the one who did it—

144
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,540
- No! 
 - Just listen to me.

145
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,350
What about your divorce?

146
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:12,100
If you get connected to the murder, divorce or whatever, you'll be at a disadvantage.

147
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,380
On top of that, the situation isn't that simple.

148
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:20,260
How and why would a sleepwalker like you go there by yourself?

149
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,640
It will obviously come out that we used my car and that the three of us going to the club was an alibi.

150
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,770
It will eventually link the three of us.

151
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,070
That night, In Sook's grandmother called.

152
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,730
She was beaten up by that guy and we went there because we were worried.

153
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,410
We saw San Ah in danger so I did it on impulse—

154
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,560
No. The impulse excuse does not make sense.

155
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,930
You brought the golf club from here. The motive is undeniable.

156
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,310
Hey. Why aren't you saying anything?

157
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:53,060
We're all in this so at least give some advice.

158
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,970
I think...

159
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,420
I think that just telling the truth would be best.

160
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,400
- What did you say? 
 - What is he talking about?

161
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,810
Excuse me.

162
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,900
Oppa... what is it?

163
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:23,730
Mi Do... I came because I have something to tell you.

164
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,350
What?

165
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,590
Ta-da.

166
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,950
Let's get married.

167
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:37,440
What? This is so sudden...

168
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,770
I have a business trip starting next week, so I think I'll be pretty busy for the next month.

169
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:01,700
Hold on a second!  What is happening right now?

170
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,310
So you're saying, we should get married because your schedule is clear?

171
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,430
Pretty much.

172
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,890
I planned a party, would all of you like to come?

173
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,540
Hey, I still haven't answered.

174
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,280
That's right.

175
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,850
Please answer.

176
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:28,400
You didn't forget that I'm dying... right?

177
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,700
So there's not much time left. Let's do everything we can.

178
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,380
Even still...

179
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,190
I want to be with you.

180
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,890
Congrats!

181
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,530
Congratulations!

182
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,050
- When did you get here? 
 - We've been here since earlier.

183
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,230
Here are Mi Do's friends, say hi.

184
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,690
Hello.

185
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,850
Congratulations, seriously.

186
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,900
Remember when you said that you wanted to come to my house? When are you coming?

187
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,420
You know that I've always been rooting for you, right?

188
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,890
Did you?

189
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,960
Thanks!

190
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,820
Congratulations.

191
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,500
This seems to be the same group that ruined my birthday party.

192
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,330
Has one person been added?

193
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,020
Hi.

194
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,610
Congrats.

195
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,550
- So that's why you did that? 
 - Huh?

196
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,090
Didn't the police come and turn the hospice inside out?

197
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:11,430
So that's why you stepped in. Telling them not to touch the hospice.

198
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,720
My dad told me.

199
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,500
I guess you guys have a love strong enough to move the Public Prosecutor General.

200
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:24,940
Did I invite you? How did you know about this?

201
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:29,190
Mi Do is my best friend... Of course, I had to come.

202
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:33,280
You liked me, so I thought that you wouldn't come.

203
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,550
Oppa, why are you being like this?

204
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:43,100
Ho Seon! Thanks for coming.

205
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,850
What are you doing?

206
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,920
These are too nice to be kept in a bathroom.

207
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,150
I could put them in my room.

208
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,970
Should we drop formalities with each other?

209
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:46,320
- Why? 
 - Just because. We're in the same position.

210
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,300
In what way?

211
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,620
Falling in love... with a terminally ill person.

212
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,590
 In Sook! Do you want to play with me?

213
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:41,560
Hey! What are you doing? What are you thinking about?

214
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:51,860
When I was younger, there was a kid like you that was pretty and popular.

215
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,230
Everyone liked her.

216
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:59,020
I didn't want to, but I liked her too.

217
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,520
But she must have disliked me.

218
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,130
Well, everyone was like that, anyway.

219
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,290
If I wasn't terminally ill,

220
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:15,120
I never would have been able to meet someone like you.

221
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,260
I was unpopular, though.

222
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,800
I was an outcast.

223
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,890
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

224
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,450
Why?

225
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,120
Is there ever a reason for being an outcast?

226
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,970
It appears that the outcasts have come together well.

227
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,550
- You weren't one, were you, Unnie? 
 - No.

228
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,240
Kids liked me.

229
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,520
I was kind and fair to everyone,

230
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,800
so I had no interest in anyone.

231
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,160
So you were the stuck-up type, weren't you?

232
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,860
Right.

233
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:01,690
To be honest, they really looked down on me.

234
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:04,720
They were all born into that life.

235
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,250
No matter how much you fall over yourself trying to rise to their level, how can you win over a birthright?

236
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,120
But look at things now!

237
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,140
They're acting all nice to me now, since I'm marrying a chaebol.

238
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,270
Don't give the gazes of others any attention.

239
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:24,360
At any rate, congratulations on today.

240
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,770
Thank you, Unnie.

241
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:34,530
It really feels like a dream. It's unreal.

242
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,860
I'm at the top where I always wanted to be,

243
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:43,060
but I'm nervous that I might fall down...

244
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,800
because of what we did.

245
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,190
Don't worry about that.

246
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,320
Let's just...

247
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,560
have fun in this moment.

248
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:20,360
 The city of Jeongnam, which has been under suspicion of poor construction on their river project for the past 5 years

249
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,190
 is being held responsible for their ill-gotten profits

250
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,550
 while working with a contracted construction company.

251
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:29,700
 Recently, relevant documentation revealed that the construction company

252
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,450
  experienced out-of-pocket expenses amounting to over 70 billion won (~70 million USD).

253
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,100
 As such, prosecution has launched a full-scale investigation of this incident.

254
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:42,800
If you take one bad guy with you when you die,

255
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,360
would that be a sin?

256
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,480
Oppa!

257
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,730
- What were you doing? 
 - Hm?

258
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,580
I'm drunk.

259
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,520
- You're drunk? 
 - Yeah.

260
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,170
What is it?

261
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:17,490
Oppa... do you love me?

262
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,920
Of course, I love you a lot.

263
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,280
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

264
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:27,190
Then... even if I told you I killed someone, would you love me?

265
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,420
Who did you kill?

266
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,510
A real bastard!

267
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,590
- Good job. 
 - Really?

268
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,090
Would you really love me if I killed someone?

269
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:50,300
 Park Du Jin, who was sentenced to 9 years of prison labor on the charge of child sexual exploitation, is set to be released tomorrow morning.

270
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,430
If you kill a guy like that, he deserved it.

271
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,170
 He is restricted from going outside late at night and drinking excessively.

272
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,150
 On top of that, until 2035,

273
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,980
 he is required to wear an electric anklet.

274
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,520
Really?

275
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:11,620
Oppa... the truth is, I have a secret.

276
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,980
What is it?

277
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,300
That is...

278
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:28,060
I was wondering why the reporters weren't here today,

279
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,260
I guess it was because of Park Du Jin's release.

280
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:34,050
Did you get dressed up for the reporters? Were you planning on saying something to them?

281
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:38,620
What are you talking about... I have a date after I leave here today.

282
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,420
That was funny.

283
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,450
I guess there's still a state of emergency over there.

284
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,300
Apparently, a murder plot on Park Du Jin was caught.

285
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,230
Everyone must be angry.

286
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,950
Of course, since the law couldn't do its job properly.

287
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:02,200
We feel the same way sometimes, no? We work hard to get people behind bars, but they get released for all sorts of excuses.

288
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,060
Have you seen criminals self-reflecting?

289
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,720
How do we know that they won't do anything again after getting released?

290
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:14,060
Do we have to solve that case?

291
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,710
I mean, everyone's ecstatic saying that a man that deserved to die got killed.

292
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,720
Do we really need to catch the perpetrator?

293
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,960
Inspector Jo Si Yeong, what do you think?

294
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,580
We should catch them.

295
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:32,960
- Why? 
 - Because it's our job. It's how we get paid.

296
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,930
Pyo In Sook and her roommates Kang Se Yeon and Sung Mi Do were together on that day.

297
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:42,660
Going off of Sung Mi Do's testimony, because no one came for her on visitation day,

298
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,700
she attended her friend's birthday party at a club.

299
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,450
There's a picture from that day on Sung Mi Do's social media, as well.

300
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,750
I follow Sung Mi Do.

301
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,270
- Why? 
 - It's a given.

302
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,640
She's famous.

303
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,410
What the heck?

304
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:21,470

305
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:24,920
What's up with this? It was here...

306
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,700
I've lost my mind...

307
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,650
I've lost it...

308
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:42,410
Oppa? Oppa!

309
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,550
Oppa, where are you?

310
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,930
Oppa! He's not here...

311
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:54,320
 The truth is, I have a secret.

312
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,520
 What is it?

313
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,660
 I killed a bad guy.

314
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:03,940
 Well, I technically wasn't the one who killed him... but I mean...

315
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,960
 What happened that day...

316
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,990
What am I going to do?

317
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,130
What am I going to do?

318
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,010
Seriously.

319
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,630
Finally, it's tomorrow!

320
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,450
- Everyone hears the sound of the ocean waiting for us, right? 
 - Yes!

321
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:35,370
I have also prepared many fun programs for us. Look forward to it!

322
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,020
See you tomorrow!

323
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,090
Why the sea, of all places? What are we going to do in a place full of nothing but water?

324
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:49,220
I wanted to go to a temple instead.

325
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:55,200
- How many times do I need to tell you? Yeong Ji asked us to spread her ashes into the sea! 
 - Oh! The sound of the sea must be so nice!

326
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,050
What are the two of you doing here?

327
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,850
A date? A date?

328
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:05,390
Stop making fun of them and go. Why are you sitting here, making others envious?

329
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,460
Date.

330
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:15,880
Remember when we were young, we'd confess to the people we liked on picnics?

331
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,580
Really?

332
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,860
I guess you've never been confessed to.

333
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:28,630
What about you? Did you confess?

334
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,690
No.

335
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,770
Why?

336
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,800
There was no one who I liked.

337
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,570
Everyone has at least one person.

338
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:44,340
There was one person, in my heart.

339
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,830
But?

340
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,480
I didn't know where she was.

341
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:56,930
She saved me, but I couldn't find her.

342
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,570
So I imagined.

343
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:08,040
What would she be doing? Maybe she's on a picnic, too.

344
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,990
She's probably fitting in and playing with the other kids.

345
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,790
Does she have a crush on someone?

346
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:20,990
But she probably doesn't like him too much.

347
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:27,590
Perhaps, she might even remember me.

348
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,430
What about you?

349
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:40,620
What do you want to do most at a picnic?

350
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:45,570
Kimbap.

351
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,030
Hm?

352
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:53,930
Make cute and small kimbap, and fill a lunch box.

353
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:59,530
And eating that kimbap with the person I like.

354
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,150
Is that all?

355
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:05,240
Yeah, that's all.

356
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,190
So this is how it's going to be?

357
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:35,030
Okay, time out.

358
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,620
You didn't work today?

359
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,590
Do you have any soju left?

360
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:55,090
Not today. Stop drinking.

361
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,350
Elder, I'll give you a glass.

362
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,910
Since I'm alone as well.

363
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,960
Go ahead.

364
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,690
Did something bad happen?

365
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:44,110
How did you live, that led to your face getting like that?

366
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,710
Well, this much is...

367
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:52,760
I'm don't mean to say that you're attractive or ugly,

368
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,610
you still have time.

369
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:59,190
It's good to have time.

370
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:04,080
So try living right, so that your face can get prettier.

371
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,800
Yes.

372
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,560
It's all over.

373
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,070
What?

374
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,250
What's wrong?

375
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,510
I think I've done something bad...

376
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:38,440
What did you do? Get in a fight?

377
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:43,330
Something even bigger might come from it.

378
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:50,270
Since I'm going to tell the whole truth starting now and delete my account,

379
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,790
it's all over.

380
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,180
With Oppa too...

381
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:59,580

382
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,190
Just a second.

383
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:18,630
What the heck, Grandma!

384
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:24,340
Time out. Time has become my life.

385
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,860
Bring the phone here, and turn yourself in.

386
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,570
Where is it?

387
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:57,170
What is it? What's going on?

388
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,470
What's up with you?

389
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,240
Woo Cheon! Where is Woo Cheon?

390
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,420
I don't know.

391
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,370
Why is she being like that?

392
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:37,490
Hey! I just spiked the drink.

393
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:40,230
I just made it seem like she was kidnapped!

394
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:44,000
She's not dead! I respect elders, okay?

395
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,580
Damn.

396
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:57,610
Grandma! Grandma!

397
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:00,610
Grandma! Grandma!

398
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,900
- Grandma! 
 - Gosh, my ears are about to fall off.

399
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,870
Oh, goodness, I must've fallen asleep.

400
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:09,700
Are you okay? Was nobody here?

401
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:14,010
Hmm? Who?

402
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:16,470
Why am I here?

403
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,010
Huh?

404
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:21,500
I had a drink earlier.

405
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:25,250
Oh, that guy must've brought me home.

406
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:29,840
- Who? 
 - Some guy at the pancake stand offered me some soju, so I had a drink.

407
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,820
But I must've been knocked out after that.

408
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:37,860
Guess my body is aging, passing out as I did.

409
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,010
That's a relief for now.

410
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:47,680
I cleaned it all up! Got rid of all this

411
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,680
and got a water filter, too.

412
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:54,420
So move back home now, will you?

413
00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:01,590
I seem fine now, but my condition will only get worse.

414
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,950
You can't take care of me when that happens.

415
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:08,250
Why couldn't I? What could I not do?

416
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:14,500
I've taken care of you since before you were potty trained.

417
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,790
Grandma,

418
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,850
can we stay at the hospice together, just for now?

419
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:26,030
Why would I go there?

420
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:29,580
I mean, I'm there and there's a lot of stuff to do there.

421
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,930
Why would I leave my house and go there?

422
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:34,580
I like it there.

423
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:39,260
Not for too long, just for a little bit.

424
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,420
Did you follow me?

425
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:20,770
You're too predictable. Making a move because you tried to go through Narae and couldn't find anything.

426
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:24,320
All a bastard like you can do is threaten others.

427
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:31,750
Hey, grasp the situation before acting all tough.

428
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:38,030
Are you going to expose Narae, too? Do you think you'll be safe if you do that?

429
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:42,210
I'm not doing this just for myself, I'm doing it for all of us!

430
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:45,950
That girl's going to die anyway. There's no need to take it this far.

431
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:50,030
If she confesses now and we wrap up the case as is,

432
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:59,670
No. In Sook will never turn herself in. I won't let her.

433
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,690
Everyone's interested in the Moss Flower case right now.

434
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:05,550
Let's say they find a connection to Narae.

435
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:08,360
Then, do you think the higher-ups will stay still?

436
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:12,390
Yes. I'm going to make them.

437
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,650
No, no.

438
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,180

439
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,930
No, don't pick up. Don't take the call.

440
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,800
No, stop it!

441
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,870
 Listen carefully.

442
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:49,120
 Falling in love... with a terminally ill person?

443
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,250

444
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,160
- What did he say? 
 - Koo Ji Pyo.

445
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,050
- He revealed his name? 
 - So it is him.

446
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,930
What is?

447
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:13,320
What?

448
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,200
Say something!

449
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,960
Of course, he wants a testimony!

450
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,090
He wants Pyo In Sook to turn herself in so this can all end.

451
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:26,110
The public opinion is in her favor. She'll turn herself in, be called a warrior of justice,

452
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:29,040
and she'll live a good final year.

453
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,300
I have Ha Young Geun's phone. I got the order to kill and Narae's records of that are with me, too.

454
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,060
If you act up, I'll pull everyone involved in

455
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:40,760
and expose all of us as I go down so you better stay quiet.

456
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,300
What is it that you want?

457
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:48,160
Time.

458
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,760
What happened? Where's the phone?

459
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,790
Your grandma is fine. She'll be okay.

460
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,660
Give me the phone.

461
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,290
I'll kill you if something happens to my grandma because of you.

462
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:14,090
Since when has Mi Do known Koo Ji Pyo?

463
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:18,470
- Why are you asking that? 
 - Since when did she know and start liking him?

464
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:22,490
How would I know that? Stop changing the subject and give me the phone.

465
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,390
Did you tell him that you'd turn yourself in?

466
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,000
Yes.

467
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:34,720
They don't know yet that San Ah's mother is the culprit.

468
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,560
So I need to take care of it soon, keep things clean.

469
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,550
For San Ah, her mom,

470
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:46,930
my grandma, Mi Do, Se Yeon,

471
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,660
and for you.

472
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:55,310
I'm the one that swung the golf club, so I can just say I came back to choke him.

473
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,330
I'm going to get caught eventually, so—

474
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:01,770
- I... always want the opposite. 
 - Huh?

475
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:06,700
It's always been this way. The things I really wish for never happen.

476
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:10,300
- So I've always wished for the opposite. 
 - What are you saying?

477
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,530
If I hope for the opposite to happen, even if it doesn't,

478
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:18,530
I feel okay about it, for some reason. You'll get caught.

479
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:22,160
You'll get caught soon, and that's how things will end.

480
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,040
I don't want to live anxiously like this,

481
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,870
and I'm scared of starting or ending things with a dying person

482
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,870
so I'd wish you'd stay out of my life.

483
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,310
I hope you'll end things this way.

484
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:36,590
Then I won't have to watch you die.

485
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:41,190
That's... That's what'll happen.

486
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:46,120
It'll happen that way. It will.

487
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,530
He said he'd love me even if I killed someone.

488
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:08,670
That's what he told me, that he loves me.

489
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:13,730
But... there's no way that'd be true. How could it be?

490
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:17,300
Didn't you say you were going to meet his father today?

491
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,860
How could I meet him, under these circumstances?

492
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:24,580
The marriage and all, it's all over.

493
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,730
No way.

494
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,200
- You're here? 
 - Hi.

495
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,180
Oppa.

496
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,910
Are you ready to go? Is your hangover not too bad?

497
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,580
About that...

498
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:45,030
What'll we do? There probably won't be any hangover stew for you at my house.

499
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,630
I thought you wouldn't come.

500
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,620
- Why not? 
 - About what I said yesterday...

501
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:05,950
You're not the one that killed him. You just went with them and stood by them.

502
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:09,050
Isn't it all over if your friend confesses?

503
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,440
I'll figure out the rest.

504
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:23,500
I think you're getting a phone call.

505
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:36,150
I forgot I had something to take care of. Let's get dinner another day.

506
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,800
Sure.

507
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,100
Here.

508
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,870
- Woo Cheon isn't back. 
 - He isn't?

509
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,800
No, he said he'd go directly to the picnic.

510
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,800
- Did he call? 
 - Sister Magdalene said that he'd be going there directly.

511
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,650
Since Young Ji isn't here, I guess he doesn't have much to do here anymore.

512
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:01,190
- In Sook! 
 - You're here?

513
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:03,330
I met the head nun,

514
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:06,690
and they told me to take care of the kitchen work.

515
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:11,050
This is my grandmother. She'll be here often for the time being.

516
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:13,410
- She'll help out in the kitchen— 
 - There's no need.

517
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:17,240
I heard you're too slow when serving food.

518
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,480
That's because there's a proper temperature—

519
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:23,810
I used to cook meals for 100 all by myself in a factory dining hall.

520
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:26,850
- No, that's not the important part. 
 - Just let me help.

521
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:29,910
I'll be so quick with everything.

522
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:32,130
Lucky you.

523
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:35,790
- Please watch over her well. 
 - There's nothing about me that needs watching.

524
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:39,760
- Still, I've got to ask. 
 - Here.

525
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,690
- What's this? 
 - I heard you're going on a picnic!

526
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:45,990
I packed some kimbap, just the way you like it.

527
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:49,440
Why did you make this?

528
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,160
Grandma, you have to stay here. If something goes wrong—

529
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,600
What's there to go wrong? Nothing's going to happen.

530
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,430
Don't worry about a thing and just enjoy your picnic.

531
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,880
Please take care of her well.

532
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,660
Okay.

533
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:21,650
- Yes, Oppa? 
 - Are you on your way?

534
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:23,890
Yes. We're on our way now.

535
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:28,100
Are you really busy? You can't come today, right?

536
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,310
I want to, but I don't think I'll be able to clear my schedule.

537
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:33,120
Oceans are meant to be visited with lovers.

538
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,400
I'll be going with a bunch of women.

539
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,500
- Is that person going with you, too? 
 - Who?

540
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,380
- Min Woo Cheon. 
  - Woo Cheon?

541
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:48,730
No, he's been gone since yesterday.

542
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:52,100
In Sook is looking down, too.

543
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,800
He hasn't been there since yesterday, huh?

544
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:02,060
Sin Tae Il. One of his men opened their mouths.

545
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,830
How did you get them to? They said they never would.

546
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:10,960
There's a place called Narae Cleaning, a company that imports air cleaner parts from China to sell. He's the CEO.

547
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,170
Then Narae Cleaning is actually a commercial agency?

548
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:17,310
I don't think they're an ordinary commercial agency.

549
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:24,410
The other agencies caught recently illegally tracked cellphones with location tracking devices for information

550
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:29,870
to share and sell that with their clients, just stuff like that. But I think Narae

551
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:34,280
took the information they obtained illegally to do worse things.

552
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,150
Contracted murder?

553
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:39,230
We need to find their connection to Min Woo Cheon.

554
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:46,260
What... What happened?

555
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,010
This is worth my life.

556
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:51,650
I've restored countless devices here.

557
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:53,800
It's always interesting to hear what customers will say to me first.

558
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,490
They say, "My entire life is on this device." So I restore it.

559
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:59,450
But once I restore it, I realize there isn't much.

560
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:06,320
- Just some lame notes, diaries, or useless pictures. 
 - I asked you what you found!

561
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,560
I was about to piss my pants.

562
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:45,560

563
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,100
 Dammit!

564
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,660

565
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:09,860
 Has it come to a point that I must track your phone?

566
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,420
 I don't like talking.

567
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:16,590
 But you keep making me.

568
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,280
 - Min Woo Cheon picked up the phone, right? 
 - Yes.

569
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,080
 I see.

570
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,780
 Does he know that it's me?

571
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:31,430
 No. No, not at all.

572
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:33,430
 And if he does?

573
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:35,280
 There's no way that would be.

574
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,750
 What did he say?

575
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:41,820
 He said he'd never let that wretch turn herself in.

576
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:45,000
 I think we need to trouble ourselves with him first.

577
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,980
 I'll take care of him at all costs! Please give me one more chance!

578
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:52,410
 Must we kill again?

579
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:11,020

580
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:26,410
It's still warm. Mom...

581
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:33,350
Mom. Mom.

582
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,600
I miss you, Mom.

583
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:40,290
Mom, I miss you.

584
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:56,020

585
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,540
Mom...

586
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,230
Mom...

587
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:19,320
Young Ji,

588
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,170
don't worry about Ji Woo

589
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:23,920
and rest peacefully.

590
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:27,850
We'll join you later.

591
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:44,910
Wow, look at this.

592
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:46,790
The view is amazing.

593
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,040
Hey, hey!  With what kind of money did we rent out this place?

594
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,630
Mi Do's rich boyfriend did it for us!

595
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:59,520
- Oh really? 
 - People mustn't become slaves to money. But in this moment, money is what I love!

596
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:04,580
They said they put our names on each room.

597
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,760
If I need to share a room with the same people as the hospice, I'm leaving.

598
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,960
I want to try rooming with other people!

599
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,890
I don't like you and your snoring either.

600
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:13,120
You grind your teeth.

601
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:34,570
Were you a smart kid?

602
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:37,400
- Yes. 
 - I wasn't.

603
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,820
I thought so.

604
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:44,030
If you were a smart kid, why did you live like that?

605
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,430
I'm not sure.

606
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,590
What color do you like?

607
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:58,000
Blue.

608
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:04,460
- What about you? 
 - The color of poop.

609
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:08,470
 Grandma, I wanted to see the ocean.

610
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:14,460
 But in Singapore, it rains all year, and the water is poop-colored.

611
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:18,850
 Just like my life. When you expect and want something,

612
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:23,990
 all of it is poop-colored. I won't have expectations.

613
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,060
What's your dream?

614
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:30,130
No such thing exists.

615
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,290
What's yours?

616
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:36,660
I just found one.

617
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:40,530
Going to Venice with you.

618
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,690
Do you like the sea or the mountains?

619
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:55,970
I used to like the mountains,

620
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,360
but now I like the sea.

621
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,840
Do you like the countryside or the city?

622
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,150
The city.

623
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:06,260
- Really? 
 - Yeah. What about you?

624
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,330
I like... the countryside.

625
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:10,490
Then me, too.

626
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:15,430
I love you.

627
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:44,830
The ocean... is too black.

628
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,620
Unni...

629
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,590
what if... In Sook were to turn herself in?

630
00:52:56,590 --> 00:53:00,030
- What? 
 - If the investigation continues,

631
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:02,400
we'll eventually all get caught.

632
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,930
Wouldn't it be better to confess before the situation gets out of hand?

633
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:10,060
You want In Sook to take responsibility for all of this?

634
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:12,260
I'm scared.

635
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:17,320
I feel like I'm just starting to become happy, so I don't want to ruin it.

636
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,240
I won't.

637
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:31,460
- Stop that. 
 - Get off me.

638
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:36,790
Goodness! Gosh!

639
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:40,320
- Can't fall asleep, can you? 
 - Goodness!

640
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,380
Why are we so stuck together?

641
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:43,620
I can't sleep.

642
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:48,460
What's wrong? It's fun, like we're on some kind of school trip.

643
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:51,260
We have to give up at least this much for them.

644
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:07,690

645
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,360
- What do you think those two are doing right now? 
 - I bet they're so happy right now.

646
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:35,660
My lips are all swollen from blowing all those balloons.

647
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:39,150
I remember my old days.

648
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:45,130
- Should I tell you about my first love? 
 - Oh, I need to use the bathroom. 
 - Suddenly so tired.

649
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:50,210
Ji Woo, are you sleeping—

650
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:16,520
What? What's wrong?

651
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:23,690
- Let's do it. 
 - Do what?

652
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:26,500
The most intense thing.

653
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:27,940
Huh?

654
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:32,480
The most intense thing a man and woman can do.

655
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:37,690
Okay.

656
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,110
What are you doing?

657
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:41,580
Doing this makes me feel closest to someone.

658
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:43,870
The most intense.

659
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:48,490
You've...

660
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:52,680
never done it, right?

661
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:06,850
What about you? Have you done it?

662
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:11,480
See,  you haven't either.

663
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:19,830
If we haven't, can we not?

664
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:25,260
I mean, we could. Everyone has a first time.

665
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:30,610
Does it not just happen naturally?

666
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:36,890
I think as long as this conversation continues, it won't be natural.

667
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:40,400
When you watch movies,

668
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,720
the second they make eye contact

669
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:50,380
they like shove each other and strip... and stuff.

670
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:52,600
Y-Yeah...

671
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:57,340
But why aren't we... acting that way?

672
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:02,990
I don't think we should keep talking about it.

673
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,640
- Right. 
 - Yup.

674
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:23,070
 Mom. Mom!

675
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,260
In Sook.

676
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:28,420
I'm okay.

677
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:32,630
It's okay.

678
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:46,380
♫  It won't take long now  ♫

679
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:53,590
♫  The day this pain will end  ♫

680
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:59,480
♫  Won't you look back on yesterday  ♫

681
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:07,290
♫  Covered in a long night, I live today again  ♫

682
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:13,280
♫  A long night  ♫

683
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:20,890
♫  If everything passes and disappears, will it be erased, then?  ♫

684
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:26,890
♫  In memory  ♫

685
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:34,640
♫  If you're smiling, I'm Happy End  ♫

686
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:41,160
♫  In memory, you are always smiling  ♫

687
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:48,470
♫  With that, I have a Happy End  ♫

688
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:54,460
♫  All the moments we drew together  ♫

689
01:00:54,460 --> 01:01:04,850
♫  Can never be erased  ♫

690
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:15,760
♫  Even now  ♫

691
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:26,040
♫  I miss you  ♫

692
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:31,870
♫  Please, don't disappear  ♫

693
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:56,190
 It's her! That woman!

694
01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:01,370
What? What are you saying?

695
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:03,780
Park Du Jin, who was released yesterday, has been murdered!

696
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:06,480
Turns out, the location was there! The place they're having the picnic.

697
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,670
 The place where Min Woo Cheon and Pyo In Sook are. You're on your way, right?

698
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:57,550
 Someone call! Call!

699
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:16,130
It's a trap.

700
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:32,640

701
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:37,130
♫  I will be like a star  ♫

702
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:39,380
 Did you see the murder relay request?

703
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:41,360
 It says they're looking for their next target.

704
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,480
 My bright and youthful days are over.

705
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:46,250
 But for them, it's now. I wanted to give them time.

706
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:49,650
 I just now started needing time. I just started wanting to live.

707
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:52,540
 Why can't we do that? We need to find evidence about the second murder.

708
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:55,420
 I can't end things here! I've always wanted to be loved.

709
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:59,070
 - Do you know how that feels? 
 - I wish I could just disappear.

710
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:01,240
 - San Ah is gone. 
 - I know who 1 is.

711
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:02,510
 I'm going to turn in the phone and end things.

712
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:08,200
 If I disappear, come to the bridge. So you won't find him.
