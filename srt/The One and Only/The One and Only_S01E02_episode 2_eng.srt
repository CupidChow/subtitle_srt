1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,410
Don't get caught.

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,910
San Ah, where are you? Come out quickly!

3
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,080
Let's just end this now.

4
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:29,520

5
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,460
I won't go. No.

6
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,650
Why won't you come? Stop this. Hide and seek is over!

7
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,140
Hey, wake up!

8
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,140
What are you, punk?

9
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,600
 How did we become us?

10
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,130
-  Sister, I am scared.  
 -  Hurry.

11
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,990
 It's because of Mi Do.

12
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,730

13
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,190
 I was diagnosed with a terminal illness.

14
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,400
What is it?

15
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,350
 -    
 - What is this?

16
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,380

17
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,560

18
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,110

19
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,330

20
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,970
 Did the world accept us because we were humans?

21
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,210
 Or is it because the world accepts us...

22
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,610
 that we become humans?

23
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,730
 Why is it my position?

24
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,640
 Let go of my leg!

25
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,180
 Mother-in-Law, what are you doing?

26
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,680
 I want to make some beef bone soup.

27
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,970
 I will make it for you.

28
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:56,060
 It's weird... Why does a baby always die in your womb?

29
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,940

30
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,570
 When somebody's name is called and given a position,

31
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,740
 we become humans.

32
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,160
 Are the test reports out?

33
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,860
 It's leukemia. You are in the fourth stage.

34
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,470
 Save me. Sister help me.

35
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:34,480
 Someday we will die due to my father.

36
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,620
 No. I will protect you.

37
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,740
Do you know who I am?

38
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,080
You son of a bitch.

39
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:22,710
 We couldn't get our spot and couldn't become a person even once.

40
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,060
 We never became us.

41
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,710
 Now we are facing death and became us.

42
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,250

43
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,480

44
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,000
Please keep quiet.

45
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,010
What are you?

46
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,840
- I am the witness. 
 - What?

47
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,680
What do we do? What can we do?

48
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,990
Did he really die?

49
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,880
No. He is not dead yet.

50
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,750
Quickly call 119.

51
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,280
No. Don't do that.

52
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,340
This was an accident. We didn't really want to kill him, right?

53
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,030
- Yes. 
  - If by killing someone

54
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,000
 we can save someone, won't you choose?

55
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,400
 We are dying anyway. How about taking one person along?

56
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,330
 Hey. Where are you going alone?

57
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,600
I... I kept stopping you, right?

58
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,620
I was worried that you were going alone, so I came along.

59
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,530
Earlier, you were the first to go.

60
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:32,530
Then, why did you bring the golf club?

61
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:37,070
If that wasn't there, would she have made a person like that with one shot?

62
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,040
No, but why are you so strong?

63
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,280
If you hit like that, will a person remain alive?

64
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,280
Please keep quiet.

65
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,450
First, let's check his breathing.

66
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:52,880
Don't touch. If you cannot take care of it properly, moving the body is dangerous.

67
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,570
Do something with the golf club.

68
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,460
There is no CCTV here. If you go that way, there is.

69
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,340
So, going this way is better. Did you bring a car?

70
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,530
Ye-Yes.

71
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,730
But it's parked a little far away. At the alley down there.

72
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,760
There is no CCTV there.

73
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,810
If you go past the alley and towards the small supermarket, there's a shortcut.

74
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:21,110
Okay. It looks like there is no CCTV here.

75
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,940
San Ah.

76
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,250
First, we have to take care of the kid. Follow me.

77
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,750
Leave the kid at this house. Tell them that she was unconscious underneath the bridge.

78
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,980
I saw her dad being killed.

79
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,860
How did you know he was the dad?

80
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,410
Maybe... the circumstance.

81
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:16,710
Why did you come to this neighborhood? What were you doing here?

82
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,650
- Who are you all? 
 - I asked you first. Why are you here?

83
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,860
You were continuously watching over San Ah, right?

84
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,650
That's right. Why were watching over her?

85
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:37,310
Hey, you CCTV. Do you know her father?

86
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,140
What are you really?

87
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,120
We should catch this guy.

88
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,890
Hey, let's pretend we didn't see each other. Then we can save you.

89
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,670
It looks like you killed many people.

90
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:52,280
No. This is the first time. Earlier, you heard everything right.

91
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,650
We came here somehow. It's not like we meant to kill him.

92
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,540
It was just an accident. Accident.

93
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,930
The kid was in danger. Anything could have happened.

94
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,920
So, when you got here somehow,

95
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,950
the kid was in danger, so it was an accident?

96
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,840
And even while carrying a golf club?

97
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,730
I didn’t know that we had a golf club.

98
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,280
If you want to report this, go ahead.

99
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,720
 Who is it?

100
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,910
What the hell did we do?

101
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:12,590
Hey, is it okay to leave the witness like that?

102
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,640
How do you know what he might do?

103
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:22,230
We should just go to the police and surrender. That would be better.

104
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,730
Accidental occurrence. Because it was...

105
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,860
Wait a moment.

106
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,080
What are you doing? Interior (decorating)?

107
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,830
It looks natural, right? If you try to hide it, we'll make it obvious.

108
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:56,030
It looks natural here.

109
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,480
There is no sticker for this trash.

110
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,970
Then, nobody will take it. It can continue to be here.

111
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,670
It means that you are leaving the evidence near the crime scene.

112
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,990
Geez.

113
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:14,890
Come in. Come in. My goodness, thank goodness! Thank god!

114
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,850
Thank you so much! It doesn't look like you are from here.

115
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,780
How... while passing by...

116
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,650
- Yes. 
 - Uhh?

117
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,120
I saw her while passing by.

118
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,580
Come here. Come inside.

119
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,140
My granddaughter. She went on a trip... to Singapore.

120
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,050
She is beautiful.

121
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:04,240
Pretty, my foot. She is always swollen like that...

122
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,090
She is pretty.

123
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,260
Why are we here?

124
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,090
Alibi.

125
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:39,890
If the witness blows up, we need to prove where we were.

126
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:45,920
We were not at Hospice. So, we were at a party for the past two hours.

127
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,610
Wear this.

128
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,260
What are you doing? Quickly wear it. Do you know its cost?

129
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,720
This is useless. I hit him.

130
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,950
I did it, so you guys stay out of it.

131
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,790
We were at the party two hours ago.

132
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:40,060
I was going to go anyway. Luckily, I left comments also.

133
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,480
Checking when people came would be difficult, as there are many people.

134
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,580
Plus, I'm sure everyone's drunk already.

135
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,680
Making everyone believe we've been here for the past 2 hours?

136
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,490
It's easy.

137
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,980
Moreover, we have merit.

138
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,900
We are terminally ill.

139
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,570
It was a visiting day, but nobody came.

140
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,200
So, we were sad, frustrated, and angry...

141
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,070
So, we came for a party.

142
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:10,530
It's an emotional line that hits well.

143
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,850
More than saying we killed someone.

144
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,250
What? When did you change?

145
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,590
 The important thing is... the phone.

146
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,330
 Definitely take care of his mobile phone.

147
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,790
 World.

148
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,090
 The world I didn't know about.

149
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:48,680
 I received a death notice. I killed someone. A world I was thrown into.

150
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,980
Unni.

151
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,290
1, 2...

152
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:06,720
Hey, what are you doing?

153
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,060
1, 2... smile a bit.

154
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,200
1, 2, 3.

155
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:19,490

156
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,260
Oh Mi Do, did you come now?

157
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,490
Oppa, we greeted each other earlier.

158
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,820
I have been here for the past two hours.

159
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,720
- Is that so? 
 - How upsetting.

160
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,960
Oh yes, that's right!

161
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,910
Let's see each other later.

162
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,830
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

163
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:52,220
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

164
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:58,000
I came two hours ago. I came in now to surprise you.

165
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,510
They are my friends.

166
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:11,270
I am sorry for not contacting you. Let us meet separately later.

167
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:15,480
- For today, just leave. 
 - Uhh?

168
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,220
I'm completely caught by my dad right now. Even a single stain will destroy it.

169
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:25,260
You've been raging and are being sued because of your parents' debt battles.

170
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:30,890
But suddenly, I'm also tangled up and being cursed, so my dad warned me to be careful.

171
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,180
- So.... 
 - That is... 
 - Stain.

172
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,970
Not a friend, but a stain.

173
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,360
Mi Do.

174
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,560
- Oppa. 
  - Were you here?

175
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,120
- Yes. 
 - Today, I had gone to the hospice.

176
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,220
I was a bit late because of work, but it was all over.

177
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,460
- Oh yeah. 
 - You had gone there?

178
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,150
Why would you go there?

179
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,090
The cake is here.

180
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,930
Unnie! Unnie!

181
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:39,700
 We started becoming us like this.

182
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,700
- Salute. 
 - When was it reported?

183
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,860
The first report was 6:00 this morning.

184
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:35,720
- Where is the person who reported it? 
 - He is being moved to the police station.

185
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,120
- They are here for sightseeing. Sightseeing. 
  - He's dead.

186
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,130
 Why do people keep dying?

187
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:47,270
 Serves him right for beating his wife!

188
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:56,700
Hey! Hey!  Aren't you going to stop him?

189
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,400
- Ohh, it's a shit show. 
 - Who are you? You cannot come in here.

190
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,900

191
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,300
- Hey, what are you doing? 
 - He is a lieutenant.

192
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,200
Lieutenant? Higher than me?

193
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,460
Isn't it him? The one who was suspended two years ago, and came back now.

194
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:31,290
What's wrong with his clothing? What's that handkerchief?

195
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,420
Who is the crazy guy?

196
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,220
The one who's been killed...?

197
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,060
Or the one who killed?

198
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,660
Sir.

199
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,950
Hello. I am Oh Jin Gyu, sorry for the late greeting.

200
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,470
Okay.

201
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,520
Okay.

202
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,050
The mobile phone isn't here.

203
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,860
Do you want to borrow it?

204
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,840
The victim's mobile phone.

205
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,800
- Track that. 
 - Okay.

206
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,720
Such a harmonious family.

207
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,490
Track the kid and her mom's whereabouts.

208
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,260
Anytime something like this happens, the family is the first suspect.

209
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,590
All right.

210
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,990
Hello, Uncle.

211
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,280
Hello.

212
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,040
Let's go.

213
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,250
 Woo Cheon!

214
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,490
 What should we eat?

215
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,210
 He told me a little while ago that he wanted to eat beef.

216
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,470
 It's the first time we are going to eat out, so I want him to choose carefully.

217
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,530
 What do you want to eat?

218
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,300
 I want to eat jjajangmyeon.

219
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,980
 Jjajamyeon? Let's make Dad buy something more delicious.

220
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,180
 - What about sweet and sour pork? 
 - Of course!

221
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,750
 Do you like it?

222
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:34,060
 Dad, I smell something strange.

223
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,020
 Mom!

224
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:05,370
 About Baek Gu, what is up with him?

225
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,980
You know the higher-ups are involved this time, right?

226
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,130
If things go wrong, everyone is dead.

227
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,300
That's why I'm requesting your service.

228
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,330
To that punk, Baek Gu.

229
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,520
No, w-w-why must you... here...

230
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,920
What? It's my dream to be an office worker.

231
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,410
We look normal so it's good.

232
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,970
So who is Baek Gu?

233
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:37,030
It's annoying. Why are you asking again and again? It's a secret.

234
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,400
We'll meet since we're in the same circle anyway.

235
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,240
W-We are not in t-the s-same circle.

236
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,740
There are rumors going around.

237
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:53,000
- I heard he only kills AT's. 
 - AT?

238
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,070
AT! AT!  Absolute trash!

239
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:58,620
- Trash, seriously. 
 - Ah... AT.

240
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:02,480
I heard he does thorough background checks on all his clients.

241
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,780
What cigarettes he buys at the store, the color of his house...

242
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:10,240
Everything was investigated. Things were thoroughly prepared,

243
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,180
but he said he has standards. He won’t kill them if the piece of trash doesn’t deserve it.

244
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,650
What kind of anti-hero is he?

245
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:23,810
Well, I guess it's hard to say a guy someone asked to kill is not trash.

246
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:27,030
The guy we took care of this time was complete trash. You took care of it well, right?

247
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,370
Definitely.

248
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:32,080
Geez.

249
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,400
He's quite peculiar.

250
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,530
Apparently, he goes around wearing a t-shirt that says "I'll kill you".

251
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,340

252
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,270
Are you tired?

253
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,270
Guardian.

254
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:16,020
Imma's hotel fees, grooming, snacks, and inoculation fees are all included.

255
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,510
But... why his name is Imma?

256
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:21,710
I think that's a typo.

257
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,990
Imma, I'll be back.

258
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,120
 Why would you come to this neighborhood?

259
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,550
 If you want to report this, go ahead.

260
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:53,600
What are you doing? Let's go.

261
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,420
I don't have my wallet.

262
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,710
 Haven't you woken up yet?

263
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,800
The door is locked...

264
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,250
Please open the door.

265
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,350
Wait a minute. We'll go out in a minute.

266
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,590
 There's no problem, right?

267
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,640
Unnie!

268
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,900
 - Are you okay?  
 - We are undressing now.

269
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,660
Wait a minute.

270
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:56,170
- What's that? 
 - What to do?

271
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:12,140
This was dropped and it didn't feel right to just leave it.

272
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,700
But I just carried it with me.

273
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,750

274
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:20,700
Lay down, fast.

275
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,120
Is there a problem?

276
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,420
No. There's no problem. We're okay.

277
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:32,040
Oh, I was scared. I was worried.

278
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,840
You can't lock the door.

279
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,390
Got it.

280
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:49,850
Why am I wearing this kind of dress?

281
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,470
What?

282
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,850
This...

283
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,660
You t-took care of it well, right?

284
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,440
 Variable.

285
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,140
 She's not from another organization.

286
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,960
You made it look like an a-accident, r-right?

287
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,140
 No, it's our first time.

288
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,370
 We didn't intended to kill him.

289
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:20,400
 It was a total accident.

290
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,730
 It's wasn't quite an accident.

291
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:24,190
A-Answer the question.

292
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,300
I t-told you right? This time is i-important.

293
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,580
You can't mess it up, bastard.

294
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:35,090
 Thank God. What a relief! Come inside.

295
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,250
 They knew each other.

296
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,120
Cell phone?

297
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:43,500
- Hyung! 
 - What?

298
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,830
Let's find a person.

299
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:51,990
Why am I wearing these clothes? They are not even mine.

300
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,410
They are my clothes.

301
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:55,050
Why am I wearing your clothes?

302
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:58,010
Yesterday, we went to party...

303
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,160
Which party?

304
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,530
Why are you behaving scary? Like someone else.

305
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:06,750
Unnie, where do you remember till?

306
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,380
What?

307
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,670
What did you do yesterday?

308
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:15,540
My husband came to visit me...

309
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,590
and then...

310
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,630
I slept, of course.

311
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:34,390
Is that all?

312
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,040
Why? What happened?

313
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:45,340
- Good morning. 
 - Good morning.

314
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,560
But yesterday was a little noisy, right?

315
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,860
I think someone went to some party.

316
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,320
They are young.

317
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,860
They should enjoy it when they are young.

318
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,610
Who goes to a party carrying a golf club around?

319
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:05,620
Were you listening?  Did you not sleep again yesterday?

320
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,940
I wasn't able to sleep because of the sound of rain.

321
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,410
So I was sitting here and looking around,

322
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:19,430
and they snuck in from over there all suspiciously.

323
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:24,410
Slowly... Slowly.

324
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,720
Don't do it. It's scary.

325
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,560
I think they have caused some trouble.

326
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,970
Why? Can you see something?

327
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:36,720
You all know Ji Hoo has supernatural skills, right?

328
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,840
How is knowing what will happen in 5 minutes a supernatural skill?

329
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,870
Everything could also be decided in 5 minutes.

330
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:49,530
I think you might have to go to school in 5 minutes.

331
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,960
Applause.

332
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,600
Isn't she pretending not to remember anything?

333
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,610
- Why would she do that? 
 -  To step out of it.

334
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:08,840
She might say, "That's what you both did and I don't remember anything as I have a problem with sleepwalking."

335
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,150
 Excuse me.

336
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,750
 You.

337
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:21,840
 No. She does have a sleepwalking problem.

338
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,960
- She did it when I first saw her. 
 - I didn't know about it.

339
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,300
She's been asleep since getting up from bed.

340
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:31,220
- So, when she said to kill one someone while you're dying... 
   - Just one person

341
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:35,120
was just nonsense she said while she was asleep?

342
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,010
She was a little different than the other days.

343
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:42,190
But then also, she went there, we killed a person, and even went to the party.

344
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:46,080
Is that possible that she cannot remember any of it?  She was asleep thewhole time?

345
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,630
Yeah.

346
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:54,410
- Hey, wait. 
 - You don't remember anything?

347
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:00,480
Even this, too?

348
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,770
What are you doing?

349
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:12,650
- We should talk. We have to talk before it's too late.  
 - No, you cannot.

350
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:15,630
It doesn't mean anything. I don't remember a thing about yesterday.

351
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:19,030
If you talk to them then, it's going to be dangerous for you only.

352
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:21,870
- Huh? 
 - You're the one that swung!

353
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:25,770
Strictly speaking, you're the one that killed him.

354
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,360
I did that?

355
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,960
That golf club was your husband's, and you were the one that swung.

356
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,530
We just went to stop you when you were sleepwalking.

357
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:39,730
It's not possible. How can I?

358
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:44,050
- Unnie, no, it's not— 
 - That's why, stay still.

359
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:48,630
- Are you crazy? 
 - Don't you know what the most important thing is to terminally ill people like us?

360
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:52,550
The time we have left. That's everything to us.

361
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,180
- What are you doing now? 
 - That's the safest thing we can do.

362
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:08,180
As long as there's a witness, even if your tail gets caught there are extenuating circumstances.

363
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:11,030
I'm going to take all the responsibility. You just get out of this.

364
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,280
Being the murderer, aiding in murder, which one seems lighter?

365
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:18,310
We're all caught in this anyway. This isn't the time for you to act aloof all alone anymore.

366
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,110
If you were going to be like this, why did you follow me?

367
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:24,110
If you wanted to live so bad, enough to act this way, why did you come with us?

368
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:27,160
- Is it not the same for you? 
 - What?

369
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,320
Do you really not have a speck of greed in you?

370
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:36,400
The time you have left... Don't you want to at least properly enjoy the time you have left before you die?

371
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,490
Properly?

372
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,460
- I haven't lived my life properly up to this point and you want me to start now? 
 - That's what I'm saying.

373
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:49,290
A hope of maybe living happily even with the time you have left...

374
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:54,220
Do you not have any reservations that there might still be more to life?

375
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:04,030
Why is there no news?

376
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:07,000
Somebody died right in the middle of a neighborhood.

377
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,400
But there is no news on that.

378
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:15,260
Did you confirm that he was dead?

379
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:20,180
If someone gets hit by a golf club, is it guaranteed that they'll die?

380
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,910
How many times do I have to tell you?

381
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:32,600
You have to floss before brushing your teeth.

382
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,760
It's wrong to brush before flossing. It's meaningless.

383
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,730
Yeah, okay Mom has to work. I have a long way to go.

384
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,960
Ey, you're going to eat ramen?

385
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,650
Hey, hurry and put the soup in the water first.

386
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,730
And you're supposed to put the noodles in after the water boils, got it?

387
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:53,400
And after you eat, you have to turn the gas off. Okay? Send me a verification photo of the valve.

388
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,410
Okay.

389
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:58,500
Team Leader, Ha Yong Geun is completely outstanding.

390
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,590
He's got 6 criminal offenses, and a few domestic violence cases.

391
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:05,600
He was getting charged here and there since he started getting his hands into gambling while in the business of prostitution.

392
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,360
Whether it be because of grudges or debts, there are a lot of people who'd want him dead,

393
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,990
but the strange thing about it is the moss rose.

394
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:15,220
If it was a grudge, why do you think they'd put a moss rose on him?

395
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:19,360
It couldn't be due to the meaning of a moss rose. Time.

396
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,180
 If that were so, the blood should have been puddling.

397
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:28,250
 The body was soaked and soggy all over, but the moss rose on his hair was not damaged.

398
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,100
So the flower must have been put there later!

399
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:35,030
If it wasn't a planned murder, they accidentally swung the blunt object and ran away...

400
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:37,740
but the flower was stuck there for an accidental murder.

401
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,640
But this neighborhood doesn't seem to have any CCTV.

402
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,250
- Would the offender have known that? 
 - Of course, they would have.

403
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,420
He died in front of his house, but what happened to the family?

404
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,950
The child and her mother were not at the house.

405
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:53,150
We've acquired the mother's whereabouts.

406
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,010
What did you say? What about San Ah?

407
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,600
She was with that jerk!  If he died, I would just–

408
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,150
Where did the child go?

409
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:10,240
We don't know if he's done already something to her! That bastard isn't even human!

410
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,290
You left your child with the man who is unpredictable and inhuman,

411
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:16,480
and have been out of the house for around a month.

412
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,180
I only had 40,000 thousand won in my bank account.

413
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,000
If I took the child with me when I left, what do you think I could have done with that money?

414
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,150
We can only run away if I earn enough money to find a place where San Ah and I can at least stay in.

415
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:31,950
Thinking "Just hang in there. Hang in there for one more day."

416
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:35,560
is how I endured it. But if something bad happened to my San Ah...

417
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,850
We searched the house and found that milk had been sprayed everywhere.

418
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:41,920
- Milk? 
 - Pesticide was mixed into it.

419
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,160
That bastard... he was trying to get the life insurance payout.

420
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,670
She didn't drink it.

421
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:52,400
If we say Ha Yong Geun passed over the cup of milk with the pesticide mixed in,

422
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,440
 and the child grabbed and tossed the cup and then ran away,

423
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,400
 would there be a place good enough for her to hide?

424
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,290
She said that she occasionally goes to the grandma's house across the neighborhood bridge.

425
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:05,030
There's a grandma that picks up waste and a girl living there.

426
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,830
Unnie!

427
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,790
Are you crazy? Why would you go to the crime scene?

428
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:18,560
What kind of idiot goes to the crime scene after killing someone?

429
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,820
We don't know if he actually died. We have to go check.

430
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:26,310
- Whether you know or not, just stay here please. 
 - You just stay here, then.

431
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:32,710
The thing I hate most is getting left out. Let's go together.

432
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,620
You ran away and hid to avoid your father.

433
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:39,770
But when you almost got caught after the phone rang, you lost consciousness.

434
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:42,990
- And when you woke up, you were here? 
 - Yes.

435
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:48,650
- Was the phone your father's? 
 - Yes.

436
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:53,330
So, some youth brought San Ah here after she collapsed in front of the house.

437
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:56,090
- Yes. 
 - Why would they have come here, of all places?

438
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:59,030
There are quite a few houses around here.

439
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:02,910
It's because I come to this house often.

440
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,880
A stranger wouldn't be able to know that.

441
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,210
We don't know! Think by yourself.

442
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:11,230
What did that youth look like?

443
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,720
Well, he looked like a dog.

444
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,360
Are you saying he left a dirty impression?

445
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,720
No, why would I mean that?

446
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,460
He was pretty, and looked sweet and gentle like a dog.

447
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,660
Even if he went around doing dirty things, his face was bright.

448
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:29,830
He had a sweet heart, too. He left some medicine that he bought before going.

449
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:34,600
But... what's going on?

450
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,790
Did my dad...

451
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:40,260
die?

452
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,720
I lived.

453
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:52,210
Now... I can go live together with my mom. Right?

454
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:57,470
I can do that, right? Now, nobody

455
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:03,570
will look for us, touch us, or hurt us...

456
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:10,630
I can just... live together with my mom, right?

457
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,420
He died.

458
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:34,060
I killed...

459
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:47,650
 San Ah!

460
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:56,650
 You went through a lot. You really went through a lot.

461
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:00,460
You struggled. It's over now.

462
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,870
It's such a relief,

463
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:06,480
since they look happy.

464
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,460
 Aigoo, you went through so much.

465
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,580
Yes, it was a day with a lot of rain, wasn't it?

466
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:24,720
I planned on closing up, but he came in, in a hurry.

467
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:33,390
- Can I check what was recorded that day? 
 - Yes.

468
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:37,640
He's a strong suspect that was caught on the pharmacy's CCTV.

469
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:42,890
Just by looking at his physiognomy, he's a psychopath.

470
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:45,320
He killed a person, and then stuck a rose moss in his hair?

471
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:50,240
He's the type that shows off his murders. You can see this as a sort of provocation as well. Provocation.

472
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,630
9:45.

473
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:54,350
The rain stopped at 11:30.

474
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:58,640
After swinging the gold club, he laid the child down at the grandma's house and bought medicine from the pharmacy...

475
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,900
After staying in that house from 10 to 11, he came out and stuck the rose moss.

476
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,770
Something is empty.

477
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:09,740
The motive is missing. Since there's no consistency to his actions.

478
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,510
The phone disappeared. Is Ha Yong Geun's phone the one that disappeared?

479
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:17,340
The last thing the signal caught was the location on the day of the incident.

480
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:22,380
Ha San Ah was holding it and it disappeared after his death. Now a signal cannot be found.

481
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:28,620
He killed a person and then took their phone... that's something with intent.

482
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,280
But would it have been only one person?

483
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:52,890
-  That was your husband's golf club and you wielded it.  
 - Was it true?

484
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:56,090
 We were just trying to  stop you from sleepwalking.

485
00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:01,820
  This wretched woman tried to kill me last night! This bitch–

486
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:06,210
 - Last night. Me! 
 - Mom! Please stop!

487
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:08,810
  Get your senses together!

488
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:13,790
 Stop! Get it together! What is wrong with you?

489
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:17,880
-  She choked my neck. She strangled my neck. 
 - All right. Come back to your senses.

490
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,660
It was true.

491
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,010
Damn, the witness.

492
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:35,850
What do we do? What made you believe the witness and let him go?

493
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,430
He covered her eyes.

494
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,470
- Are you okay? 
 - What happened?

495
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:19,140
Let's quickly return to the hospice. Hurry!

496
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,780
Okay, hold on.

497
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,120
  In Sook!

498
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:02,330
 Do you want to play with me?

499
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:34,720
That day... weirdly she pestered me.

500
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,700
She asked me to buy a swimsuit and swimming cap.

501
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:42,440
I told her she couldn't get water into her ears because of the infection and tried to stop her, but

502
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:48,970
she found a swimsuit and my shower cap and went anyway.

503
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:55,910
Pus came out of her ears for a year and the infection got worse.

504
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:58,790
She couldn't hear well from then on.

505
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:01,400
So it was that sound...

506
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,740
- What? 
 - I asked unnie.

507
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:08,620
What was the last sound she heard well?

508
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:15,950
Unnie said she heard laughter, cheerful sniggers.

509
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,160
San Ah eat.

510
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,350
If my In Sook had a mom...

511
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:38,330
If her mom was by her side...

512
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:44,980
The first time In Sook came to me...

513
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,590
 No. Raise your own child yourself!

514
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:52,620
 Mom!

515
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:58,810
 It wasn't that I didn't want to,

516
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:05,730
 I thought if I made a fuss, In Sook would be able to go to her mom.

517
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:10,680
 She squeezed her hands into fists that turned so red.

518
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:18,250
 Children know everything

519
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:21,790
 Why would they not know when they are being thrown away?

520
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:25,150
 How afraid and disturbed she must've been.

521
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,100
Even so, she just fisted her hands

522
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,410
and held it in.

523
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:41,170
Being angry, sad, afraid, and

524
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:45,150
sad... she just held it in.

525
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:51,960
She didn't cry or laugh.

526
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,020
She just held it in!

527
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,010
That is the saddest part for me.

528
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:14,000
Hey, so..

529
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,080
In the end, I did all the work.

530
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,930
What did he do?

531
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:24,460
- I'm so mad. 
 - Gosh, Bro.

532
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:31,970
Hey, I can just tell this case will be good.

533
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:37,510
- That's why I'm trying so hard to get it right. 
 - Bro...

534
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:42,540
So what's the case? I think Bro's cases are more interesting than movies.

535
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:46,360
- Is that so? 
 - Of course!

536
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,790
- A person died. 
 - Really?

537
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:52,500
But on the head...

538
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,730
- ... were flowers. 
 - Pepper? 
  (TN: pepper and flowers sound similar in Korean)

539
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:01,500
Flowers! Flower, you dummy.

540
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:05,270
- You bastard. You punk. 
 - What are you saying...

541
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:09,920
But I was so distracted by this flower that I didn't know.

542
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:16,500
When I looked closely at the victim, he was familiar.

543
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:22,430
- He was frequently seen at your gambling den. 
 - Oh the guys at our gambling den...

544
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:25,720
They all look like this. Everyone is the same.

545
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,120
Right? They all look like that.

546
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:31,670
Why do they all look similar?

547
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:37,350
Is this the guy?

548
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:49,660
I'm right! You're nice so you can't lie!

549
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:55,370
So nice! Good job, now let's talk.

550
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:57,800

551
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,030
I will start the briefing.

552
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,310
His name is Min Woo Cheon.

553
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:05,460
Age... where is it? Here.

554
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:08,900
29 years old. Here's the rest.

555
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,190
- The end. 
 - What?

556
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:16,490
There's nothing in his history. There's no record past middle school.

557
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,990
Should I go over that?

558
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:25,570
He was smart when young. He won more than one math and science competition.

559
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:29,390
He went to juvie after dropping out of middle school.

560
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:32,360
- Why? 
 - He killed a classmate.

561
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,460
That's the main point. What do you mean by the end?

562
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:37,030
An accident. It was an innocent accident.

563
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:40,040
- What about his family? 
 - His parents are dead.

564
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:43,100
When Min Woo Cheon was young, his father tried to commit murder suicide,

565
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,540
but the son survived with his mother.

566
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:48,830
The two of them lived together until he came out of juvie

567
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:51,120
and his mother died from chronic illness not long after.

568
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,180
What are Min Woo Cheon's whereabouts?

569
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:55,000
That's the thing... we don't even know his address.

570
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
He has no credit cards, no cell phone. It's like he's from the Joseon dynasty.

571
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,770
But there's one official record.

572
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:03,300
Psychiatrist.

573
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,720
Th-Th-This person

574
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,580
Wh-Who is this?

575
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:25,260
This person... her life is quite...

576
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:27,820
After her p-parents' d-divorce,

577
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:32,060
she lived with her g-grandmother and after g-graduating from h-high school she scrubbed people at saunas.

578
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:37,170
Then she was diagnosed with a b-brain tumor with limited time to live. The end.

579
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:45,230
 That's my granddaughter. She's on vacation in Singapore.

580
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:47,500

581
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,380
So who is it?

582
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:58,380
Is Head Shin Tae Il there?

583
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,220
 Tell your boss to come out!

584
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:05,030
 Not coming out?!

585
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:08,290
 Quickly!

586
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:12,780
- Geez. 
 - Oh, oh, wait.

587
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:17,790
Assistant Managers Kim and Park, go take a break.

588
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:21,840
 - What's going on? 
 - Just hurry.

589
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:26,650
What happened?

590
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:29,930
- Why is there an investigation? 
 - Investigation?

591
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:31,970
I clearly told you

592
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:36,560
to do it quietly and pass it off as an accident.

593
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,790
Isn't that why I paid you so much?

594
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:44,480
 - You should have just asked me to investigate the case.  
 - Wait... Wh-what are you saying?

595
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,160
Why would you kill someone and put a flower on them?!

596
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:51,590
- F-Flower? 
 - That catches people's attention you idiot.

597
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:56,820
Where is he? Where is that son of a bitch Baek Gu?

598
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:03,760
Sugar or cream?

599
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:06,290
What the?

600
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,380
Bookkeeping.

601
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:15,530
Book... Bookkeeping.

602
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:21,660
Are you an idiot?

603
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:31,890
You badass punks.

604
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,790
The cellphone. Be sure about how you took care of the cellphone.

605
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:41,020
If the higher-ups know about this, you die, I die, we all die!

606
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:43,100
Yes.

607
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:55,520
Either kill or do something about that Baek Gu bastard. You figure it out.

608
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:17,690
Why is she not waking up? She's been laying down for so long.

609
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:20,480
She's not going to die, right?

610
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,190
- Seriously, what are we going to do? 
 - Green ray of light.

611
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:29,160
She wanted to see the green rays before she died.

612
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,130
- What's that? 
 - Green rays are

613
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:35,490
light that one can see when the sun sets by the ocean.

614
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:40,920
It's the refraction of light phenomenon. If there's green color in Heaven,

615
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,020
then it would symbolize hope.

616
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,010
I want to see that.

617
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:48,900
- Are you awake? 
 - Are you okay?

618
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:54,000
I want to see that.

619
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,900
Yeah, let's go see it.

620
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:00,030
- When? 
 - Anytime.

621
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:20,860
W-What happened? You said it looked like an a-accident.

622
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:24,290
- There was a variable. 
 - A variable?

623
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:27,040
Is she the variable?

624
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:35,810
I'll take care of it.

625
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:41,260
Okay, you need to get rid of the variable.

626
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,730
The cellphone is taken care of right?

627
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:57,080
I wanted to know why.

628
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:02,500
Every morning, the patients would sit here

629
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,270
and look at the sunlight.

630
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:12,040
I guess seeing the morning of another day is something to be grateful for.

631
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:19,360
It's because tomorrow is not guaranteed for us.

632
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:25,090
I wish there was no tomorrow.

633
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:26,830
We saw the police line.

634
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:31,490
That means the police were there. But why is it so quiet?

635
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:33,770
What was inside me?

636
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:36,710
What was inside me that made me go there?

637
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:41,760
That's because that guy was going to catch the kid. You just panicked and stepped forward.

638
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,600
Was it a sense of justice?

639
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,680
Was it anger?

640
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:51,800
When you learned you were going to die,

641
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,130
how did you feel?

642
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:02,300
I just stared at the doctor.

643
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:08,080
 We ran a test because we suspected lung cancer and confirmed that it is adenocarcinoma.

644
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:11,060
 Based on the scans, it is stage 4.

645
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:15,490
 I saw the doctor's expression and he was looking at me.

646
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:19,410
 Was it sadness or compassion?

647
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:23,410
 And I tried to look as devastated as I could.

648
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:26,010
 And I thought,

649
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:31,570
 "Lung cancer sucks. I don't even smoke."

650
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:37,770
So, I was thinking if the doctor's expression was not good.

651
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:41,230
Isn't it funny?

652
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:45,730
I'm like that... I've been like that my whole life.

653
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:48,180
I was like that at that moment as well.

654
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:54,190
I... I didn't know how I should feel.

655
00:56:55,950 --> 00:57:04,150
Sadness? Fear? Anger?

656
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:07,370
I thought I should feel one of those, but...

657
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:14,460
I didn't know.

658
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:18,780
When big things happen, you just feel overwhelmed.

659
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:24,290
I left the hospital in a daze and had no one to talk to.

660
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:29,940
You feel less of it if you share your sadness with someone.

661
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,480
I told my dad first.

662
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,630
 I'm going to die. It's a brain tumor.

663
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:37,220
 What?

664
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,650
I wanted revenge.

665
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:44,460
You threw me away

666
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:48,640
and I lived so pathetically.

667
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:50,970
Now I'm going to die.

668
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:57,000
So I wanted him to be sad, grieve, blame himself

669
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,310
and regret everything.

670
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:05,020
But... I failed.

671
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:21,160
Miss In Sook, someone is looking for you.

672
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:36,620
Thank you for the ₩5,000,000.

673
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,100
I won't be able to pay you back.

674
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:44,800
Why did you come?

675
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,790
I... what can I...

676
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:51,310
I don't know what I can do.

677
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:53,360
It's always been like that.

678
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:58,500
So I just turn the other way and run.

679
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,970
First, I sent you the money because you asked.

680
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:04,210
But this isn't it. If you just give up–

681
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:09,380
Just continue living without knowing. Or pretend you don't know.

682
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:15,790
I... I wasn't a good father.

683
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:18,240
I wasn't a good person either.

684
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:22,760
I wasn't anything.

685
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,570
But...

686
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:29,560
I remember. When you were a baby,

687
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:34,340
your smile while you wiggled on top of my stomach.

688
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:39,260
And back then, what made me happy...

689
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:41,330
I remember.

690
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:43,990
In Sook...

691
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,460
Don't cry.

692
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:58,390
My grief...

693
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:00,820
I don't want to be comforted by you.

694
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:06,120
I'm sorry. I'm s-sorry.

695
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:14,480
Since I'm dying, I want to forgive you,

696
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,900
thank you, and love you.

697
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:19,460
I want to do that, but

698
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:24,610
I can't do that.

699
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:33,420

700
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:42,210

701
01:00:51,090 --> 01:00:54,660
You asked me that day, didn't you? Why I got divorced?

702
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:57,200
Your mom wanted it.

703
01:00:57,770 --> 01:01:00,710
She said she couldn't stand me anymore.

704
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:08,110
I really did everything I could to not get divorced,

705
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:11,980
but maybe it was out of love, maybe out of anger.

706
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:16,480
Your mother was so stubborn insisting that she raised you, I didn't give you to her.

707
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,430
After divorcing,

708
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:22,100
she did everything she could to meet you, but I didn't let her.

709
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:26,480
So, where is she now?

710
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:29,490
She already passed.

711
01:01:35,370 --> 01:01:38,750
I believe it was about 5 years after the divorce.

712
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:40,690
By cancer, apparently.

713
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:43,560
But I didn't show you to her until the very end.

714
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:46,050
I thought of it as revenge.

715
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:50,020
I was getting revenge after she abandoned me and left.

716
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:53,770
Don't think that you were alone!

717
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:58,680
Don't think that your mother had abandoned you,

718
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:03,770
or that no one loved you.

719
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:06,870
Your mom only looked for you until the day she died.

720
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:12,350
I regret it, I couldn't even let you guys say goodbye.

721
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:16,960
I also feel like I'm getting punished since you ended up this way, too.

722
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,310
But your mother, grandmother, and myself...

723
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:22,040
we all loved you.

724
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,150
As if that would be a big deal.

725
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,420
I'm sorry...

726
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:49,780
You're too late...

727
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:57,620

728
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:47,620
 You have to remove the variable.

729
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:50,430
 You took care of the phone, didn't you?

730
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,760
 But...

731
01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:03,430
 What's with the rose moss?

732
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:11,620
 Because it was pretty...

733
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,480
 That day...

734
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:26,690
 everything was just strange altogether.

735
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:30,290
 There are days like that.

736
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:33,600
 Days where as if you're broken,

737
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:39,530
 you don't know the meaning of your feelings, or your actions.

738
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:50,730
 It's been so long since summer ended,

739
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:54,210
 but that flower that was between stones blooming with all its might,

740
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,820
 was just so pretty.

741
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:38,540
Give it to me. My wallet.

742
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:41,630
What?

743
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:45,290
I said to give me my wallet.

744
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:11,130

745
01:06:11,130 --> 01:06:13,610
 The patient that Min Woo Cheon will be caring for

746
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:16,190
 needs more help, especially at night.

747
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:18,620
 Even though I seem this way, I have insomnia.

748
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:21,810
 Oh my! That's great to hear.

749
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:24,160
 - My wallet. 
 - Evidence?

750
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,740
 The evidence that you left after killing that man?

751
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:30,980
 If you go down, that means I'm going down too.

752
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:33,530
 - Do you like that man? 
 - It's really strange.

753
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:36,610
 So are you thinking of falling in love or something? In this situation?

754
01:06:36,610 --> 01:06:40,830
 You... like me?

755
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:47,610

756
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:50,100
 Exploding with fun!
