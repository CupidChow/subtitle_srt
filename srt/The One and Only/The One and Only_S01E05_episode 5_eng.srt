1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,830

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:13,200
 For me, murder was no more than a dot.

3
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,350
 If I erased the dot properly, that would be it.

4
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,140
 You can't be here. Everyone, please go in.

5
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,780
 Please go in.

6
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,550
 Guilt? I don't know.

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,280
 I was living in prison anyway.

8
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,440
 But since when was it?

9
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,170
 Wow...

10
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,500
 You can do it with more strength.

11
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,150
 That feels good.

12
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,690
 I found out that

13
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:12,210
 what I had erased, was not merely a dot.

14
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,090
 Stop it! Let's end it here.

15
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,520
 What's wrong with you?

16
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,250
 Step away.

17
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,590
 The gaze,

18
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,130
 the person or love,

19
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,470
 I regretted it for the first time, and I became ashamed.

20
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,100
 You jerk.

21
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,940
 I became afraid of losing you.

22
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,210

23
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,080
 I couldn't find it.

24
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,060
I definitely got

25
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,270
a cell phone signal near there.

26
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,190
Golf club.

27
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,720
As a result of analyzing the characteristics of tool marks,

28
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,860
the murder weapon turned out to be a golf club.

29
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,650
The amount of strength was pretty huge.

30
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:43,860
It's not like he picked up a brick nearby. If it's a golf club, it's not an accidental crime.

31
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,380
At that late night, he went to Ha Yong Geun's house with a golf club.

32
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,820
That's a clear intention to kill!

33
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,850
It's weird that he prepared a golf club as a murder weapon.

34
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,640
What if it's a golf club that someone threw away nearby.

35
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,320
Nobody living in a neighborhood like that would play golf.

36
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,000
Investigate the residents of the neighborhood

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,910
and see if anyone recently threw away golf clubs.

38
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,450
I'm telling you there'd be no one. Why investigate that?

39
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,070
Will it be possible to analyze specific models of golf clubs?

40
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,250
Well, even if you find the model, the range is too wide.

41
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,530
First, we need to find the golf club.

42
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,790
Take some medication for your headache.

43
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,570
They are coming.

44
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,920
- Hey. Come here. 
 - Hi.

45
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,450
Something is not right.

46
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,070
Yesterday, they slept together.

47
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,880
- Did... it not go well? 
 - Should we feed him some bokbunja? 
  (T/N Korean raspberry, though to be good for stamina)

48
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,120
Come on.

49
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,200
We're talking about good things.

50
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:01,150

51
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,070
Crazy bastard.

52
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,610
What's wrong?

53
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,390
Did you find Woo Cheon?

54
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,150
You didn't hear it or you're not listening?

55
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,460
What the hell? Where are you going?

56
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,090
Did you guys fight?

57
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,510
- Then what is it? 
 - I'm just a bad guy.

58
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,160
Are you having a lovers quarrel in this situation?

59
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,080
Did something happen to you while you were arrested?

60
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,460
What did the police ask? What did you say to be released?

61
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,650
I just said I found the child unconscious, so I took her home.

62
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,410
- Is that everything? 
 - You didn't say anything, right?

63
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,950
I'm out of my mind.

64
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,440
I'm crazy.

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,100
Just say it's your fault.

66
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,200
- Get lost. 
 - Okay, I'll get lost.

67
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,170
Do you have something to say?

68
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,610
"No, I'm not a person who kills people.

69
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,090
It's a misunderstanding." If you're going to say that say it.

70
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,420
- No. 
 - No?

71
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,550
- No, you're not? 
 - No, I am.

72
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,480
- Then it's true? 
 - Yes.

73
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,870
Then you came to kill him that day and I was the one who interfered.

74
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,870
You're here because of the phone.

75
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,960
The reason you didn't snitch after being arrested is because you felt guilty.

76
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,770
It was all a lie.

77
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,180
Like an earthworm inside a circle, everything was a lie. Right?

78
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,820
I'm laughing because I'm so embarrassed.

79
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,280
What did I expect?

80
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:37,280
But still, I... felt you were a wriggling earthworm.

81
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,110
and I did so because I didn't want you to be trampled to death...

82
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,370
But it all ended up being a lie.

83
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,710
A murderer? That's true.

84
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:51,370
I killed someone, too. Just two murderers hanging out. Isn't that funny?

85
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,270
I guess we have something in common.

86
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,370
I was wrong.

87
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:01,050
Not to me, but the people you killed.

88
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,570
You're here for the phone.

89
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,090
Did you leave this morning looking for that?

90
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,300
Since I'm worried about my grandmother, you thought it was there?

91
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,220
It wasn't there.

92
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,550
- It was not there? 
 - No.

93
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,190
Did you really go to find that?

94
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,140
- Yes. 
 - What are you really?

95
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,240
Is it your job to kill people?

96
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,800
Is that your job? Is that really you?

97
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,530
I lived like that.

98
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,240
That's how I lived.

99
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,560
Why? Why did you live like that?

100
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,520
Why?

101
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,210
A murderer? What do you mean?

102
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:08,600
That day, were you really there to kill him?

103
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,750
What's with all this junk?

104
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,210
Are you a Blue lover or what?

105
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,110
Do we need to throw this out or keep it.

106
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,040
Is that usable?

107
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,110
Just leave it.

108
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:05,310
So, Woo Cheon came to kill him that day, but we intervened.

109
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,780
But a contractor for murder? Wow, aren't people like that only in movies?

110
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:14,930
What kind of killer looks like that?

111
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:19,030
I've never seen a murderer before.

112
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,310
He looks so dense.

113
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,120
Is it a high level of tactics?

114
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,440
- You're talking about camouflage, right? 
 - Why are you pointing that out now?

115
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,700
How did you know?

116
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,170
He didn't blow our cover because he felt guilty.

117
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:38,050
Liking me was just an excuse.

118
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:43,180
Why are you bringing that up? Do you want the murderer to like you?

119
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,730
He came to kill him that day, right?

120
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,390
Isn't it better?

121
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:53,050
If he is a murderer, then putting the blame on him is all we have to do.

122
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,060
If they investigate, they'll find out that he is a contract killer.

123
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,380
Then naturally, he will become the culprit.

124
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,500
And we witnessed it on our way to your grandmother's house.

125
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,750
- But he didn't kill him. 
 - He was going to kill him.

126
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,590
But if he felt uneasy about it, it's much simpler for him to tell the truth.

127
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:12,120
To get rid of the suspicion, he could just say we were the murderers.

128
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,850
Why would he just leave the investigation room?

129
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,150
You're right. It's was weird.

130
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,620
You look like you're about to cry.

131
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,650
Not even. I don't cry.

132
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,760
Even in a fight, you need to take a stance.

133
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,870
But I don't have my own stance.

134
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,390
It's just that I'm bad no matter what.

135
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,350
That's the scariest thing, isn't it?

136
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,110
Only you know that you're really bad.

137
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,570
I'm scared too if I'm a bad kid.

138
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,390
Why would you be?

139
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:02,590
Others wouldn't know. Only I do.

140
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,620
Only I know that I'm bad.

141
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,790
Really bad.

142
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,160
See? You're crying.

143
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,950
What's wrong? So burdensome.

144
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,910
I regret it.

145
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,990
I'm scared.

146
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,840
Then that's fine.

147
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,980
You're a good person.

148
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:39,300
You met someone who makes you feel regret for your bad doings.

149
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,480
Isn't that love?

150
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,840
Wanting to become a better person,

151
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,110
making each other better.

152
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,830
Where are you going?

153
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,570
The phone, where did you put it?

154
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,770
What? Why are you asking all of a sudden?

155
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,270
Where did you leave it? Did you hide it where I told you to?

156
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:21,900
Yeah, where all the junk is. I hid it in between the video and audiotapes.

157
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,030
What's going on?

158
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,360
- The police are looking for it. 
 - What?

159
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,010
Why? What's on the phone?

160
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,850
I don't know. It could be important, but the phone isn't there.

161
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,770
What are you saying? Did Woo Cheon say that? Did he go there?

162
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,600
- Yes. 
 - Why?

163
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,660
He must've looked for it because there was something important inside.

164
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,610
Something important?

165
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:48,460
Do you think there's some kind of evidence in there?

166
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,020
- Don't you think he stole it? 
 - No. It can't be.

167
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,520
What do you mean no? Do you still believe in him?

168
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:01,320
First, I need to see it with my own eyes. My grandmother might be in danger.

169
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,370
 - Woo Cheon. 
 - Woo Cheon....

170
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,910
  What's wrong with his eyes?

171
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,280
Woo Cheon, sit!

172
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,170
How many days have you not slept?

173
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:34,310
How can you walk around like that?

174
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,830
- I'm fine.  
 - What's fine?

175
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,850
Humans can't stay without sleep.

176
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,850
Really, I'm fine.

177
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,990
 - Where are you going? 
 - Woo Cheon!

178
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,000
Oh my! Don't fall over! Oh, dear.

179
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,760
I am worried for him.

180
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,070
It seems like he really did fight with In Sook.

181
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,980
Why do you think they fought?

182
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,880
What kind of person is good on their first time?

183
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,690
Some men are bad at it.

184
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,520
What nonsense are you saying?

185
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,570
Good job.

186
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,340
Grandmother...

187
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,380
What should I do?

188
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:40,720
 Yeah, where all the junk is. I hid it in between the video and audiotapes.

189
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:07,970
Thank you for coming earlier than we expected.

190
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,450
I should have done it sooner. I am sorry. I'll come sooner next time.

191
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:15,320
- Did the police come? 
 - We're so grateful you'd come and visit yourself like this.

192
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,940
- Really? 
 - Let's go quietly.

193
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,230
Thank you.

194
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,020
Oh! Mi Do is here.

195
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,660
Mi Do!

196
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,590
Why are you like that? Do you know him?

197
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,430
It's nothing. Let's just leave.

198
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,860
Hey, Sung Mi Do.

199
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:45,470
The LE Group has promised massive support towards the hospice.

200
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,510
The public opinion about our center is not that great sometimes.

201
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,860
That women are dying off in herds, or this place is unlucky.

202
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,300
Well, it's not because of that.

203
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,880
Some random things are also involved.

204
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,560
Truthfully, we could have gone bankrupt.

205
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,460
But the LE Group could be a reliable defense.

206
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,880
I think it's thanks to Mi Do. I heard you're friends!

207
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,790
Friends? Friend?

208
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,710
Are we not friends?

209
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,610
- What kind of friends? 
 - What?

210
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:34,980
A hospice for women. Doesn't that attract attention?

211
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,080
Of course, it's not that I don't have any plans.

212
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,520
Because I need to improve the image of the company.

213
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,020
What's up with you?

214
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,640
Why suddenly pretend to be a feminist?

215
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,900
Not that. You disappeared that day and didn't contact me.

216
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,820
I've been working. Didn't I tell you then, that I had an important company project?

217
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,940
Oh... so you have time for brunch

218
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,160
but you don't have time to send me a text message.

219
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,650
You also didn't contact me.

220
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:09,410
What the heck? Do you really not know?

221
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,570
If a girl slept with a guy

222
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:16,650
but if the guy just disappears and doesn't reach out, what kind of girl... So annoying.

223
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,220
So we slept together and what? What would I say?

224
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,860
Good morning? Did you feel good? That's so weird.

225
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,290
If not that then at least send an emoticon.

226
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:30,110
I don't use emoticons. If there's no reason to say anything, I usually don't reach out.

227
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,030
Are you mad?

228
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:39,980
Did I come for no reason? I put a lot of thought into this though.

229
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,810
I had fun with you that day and I had work the next day.

230
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:48,170
As I was working, I thought I should donate to where you were.

231
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:51,790
So I wrapped up my work to clear my schedule so I can come here as soon as possible.

232
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,860
Don't be mad.

233
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,060
Don't be mad, okay?

234
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,970
Whatever...

235
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,270
Let's see, let's see...

236
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:14,000
Looking at them side by side, his face is a bit lacking.

237
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,540
Who? Woo Cheon?

238
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:22,930
No way... His clothes are dirty, but his face is handsome.

239
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:26,540
- They have different flavors, right? 
 - Of course, they are different flavors.

240
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,050
- Not that. Charm. 
 - Flavor?

241
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,720
- I said charm. 
 - Flavor?

242
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,470
Charm.

243
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,960
Where did In Sook go?

244
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,600
Why are you looking for her? Go away.

245
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,080
Okay...

246
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,730
Give me a second.

247
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,100
Where's the cellphone? Did you find it?

248
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,010
What happened? Was it really not there?

249
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:31,670
What the heck? Where did it go?

250
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:34,360
Did your grandmother sell the junk?

251
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,960
What the heck? Can you just ignore people like that when you want to?

252
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,750
Your personality is seriously the worst.

253
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:44,400
Hey! I asked what happened? It's not there?

254
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,020
It's not there.

255
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,990
It can't have moved on its own.

256
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:52,510
Then, did someone go into your house? Why? How?

257
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,990
Aside from us, no one knows the cellphone was in your grandmother's house.

258
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:00,590
Aside from us, only Woo Cheon knows.

259
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,450
Hey, he took it.

260
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,630
Excuse me.

261
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,230
Oppa...

262
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,700
I think I need to go, so I came to say bye.

263
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,670
You're leaving already?

264
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:21,340
I'll come again. Now I have a reason to visit often.

265
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,790
My name is Koo Ji Pyo. I'll see you next time.

266
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,060
Oh, okay.

267
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,230
I'm leaving.

268
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,880
Beat Woo Cheon up.

269
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,340
Who was that man earlier?

270
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:45,330
What? Oh... why?

271
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:48,230
You seemed really harsh towards him.

272
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:51,400
I can be harsh because he's a bad guy.

273
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,810
Why is he bad?

274
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,510
He did something bad, so he's a bad guy.

275
00:21:55,510 --> 00:22:00,020
He looks like he's lacking in something, but he's really scary.

276
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,300
Oh really?

277
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,930
I need to go now.

278
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:09,160
Hey... I'll just be the first to message you.

279
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,440
As many times as you want.

280
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,540
We are hosting the bazaar. It would be our first support project.

281
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,020
Let's do well together.

282
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,630
Okay!

283
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,480
Why don't you listen to my words, and get beaten up?

284
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,250
Seriously.

285
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,730
Won't that jerk snap out of it? I told you to discipline him quickly and finish the task, right?

286
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:40,340
I think there must be another way.

287
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:44,620
J-Just give me a l-little more time.

288
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:49,690
Time is gold. You can't just keep asking me to give you gold.

289
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,970
Should I just cut you loose?

290
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:56,970
You know I have a spy in the police force, right?

291
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:02,680
Already, the detective is trying to find the connection between Baek Gu and Ha Yong Geun.

292
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,790
Should I turn you in, too?

293
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,630
Clear your head and say that guy had a connection

294
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:11,460
and let it slip that it was a contract murder?

295
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,390
Then, do you think I'll go down alone?

296
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,920
I have all our client information.

297
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:25,140
- What? 
 - In that case, you would get caught and it would travel up the ranks.

298
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,950
This son of a–

299
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:56,780
Hanging up after three rings is a warning that this is the last chance.

300
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:05,020
- Mobile phone. Find out for sure how it was dealt with. 
 - Okay.

301
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,000
Someone took the phone.

302
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,200
The signal was turned off after being on for a little while.

303
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,120
The chances of it getting soaked in the water are high.

304
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,710
I think that the signal was turned off after being briefly turned on faintly.

305
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:20,460
Anyway, someone took it and left.

306
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,540
There must have been a reason they took it.

307
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,890
All right, all right. CCTV.

308
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,790
CCTV.

309
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,360
I have obtained all of the CCTV footage near the market, but since that spot is pretty secluded, some stores had no CCTV at all.

310
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,930
At least the road should be fully captured.

311
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,940
Let's check.

312
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,780
What?

313
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,940
It would take a lot of time to look through all of that.

314
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,210
Do you not have time?

315
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:47,570
No, it's just that I have to search through that neighborhood to find if someone threw away a golf club.

316
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,850
I'll check the CCTV.

317
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:53,120
You will? Work hard, then.

318
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:06,100
G-Grandma, I'll help you.

319
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,950
Thanks.

320
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,010
You came again?

321
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:23,060
Yes, I was just passing through.

322
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,360
Why are you here?

323
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,270
Why are you?

324
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,980
Do you know each other?

325
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:33,570
But this time, he's the one whose face is messed up.

326
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,950
Did you guys fight?

327
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,150
No-no-no.

328
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,650
Please go ahead, I'll push.

329
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,920
Okay, thanks.

330
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,870
Don't say anything useless.

331
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,810
It's good for your body, drink.

332
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,830
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

333
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,640
Who took this down?

334
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,680
Did someone come through?

335
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,390
What happened?

336
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:20,660
This is where my granddaughter went on a trip.

337
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:24,090
Could someone have come in?

338
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,510
Should we report it?

339
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:30,960
No, no. There's a kid that comes and goes.

340
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,840
But why did she take this down?

341
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,270
- Your granddaughter went on a trip? 
 - Yes.

342
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,860
What about her parents?

343
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:43,000
Her mom passed early and her dad runs a bar,

344
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,530
but he binges all of the alcohol himself and talks nonsense.

345
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:51,140
But this boy, he left like that and hasn't even called.

346
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:54,410
The bar, w-w-where...

347
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,710
You don't drink.

348
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,290
Don't say useless things.

349
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,460
Did you eat all of the jangjorim? 
  (T/N: soy sauce braised beef)

350
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,940
He ate all of it.

351
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:09,070
J-J-J-Jangjorim? I-I-I...

352
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,990
I did? It was so delicious!

353
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:24,040
Why did you come here?

354
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:30,140
What excuse do I have to visit family? It's for threatening.

355
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,130
Are you going to grab that grandma, and threaten her to confess?

356
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,870
Yes.

357
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:40,810
You must have been in a hurry.

358
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,690
Why are you so slow?

359
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:48,180
What? You jerk?

360
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:52,030
If we get our hands on the phone, they can't mess with us recklessly.

361
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:00,600
Do you have it?

362
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,360
At any rate, they don't have it.

363
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,050
W-What are you thinking right now?

364
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,590
What's in that phone?

365
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:12,460
I... I don't know. Looking at the organization getting so nervous, it must be someone higher up.

366
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:16,390
Won't it be something that can reveal the branch of the higher-ups?

367
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,670
Then say that I have it, that they can't touch me.

368
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,790
We can make a quick buck from it.

369
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,340
That money the dead guy tried to get, we can get it.

370
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:31,410
Woo Cheon, I'm starting to see something in your eyes.

371
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,420
They're starting to fill with something.

372
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:38,390
The reason I pulled you to this side was because you were empty.

373
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,730
 He just sits blank-minded in front of the house his mom died in.

374
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:50,880
 I don't think he's eaten in a few days. At this rate, I think he'll die.

375
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,400
 He can't die like that. Then I won't be able to live.

376
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,280
 Keep watching over him.

377
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,400
 Because he's a human. An animal that has to live by any means.

378
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,240
 He'll get up to live again.

379
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:21,140
That's when I thought, I had to save you.

380
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:25,080
When I saw your empty eyes.

381
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,700
 Eat slowly. You might get indigestion.

382
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:39,970
Like a lost dog, you ate what you were given, slept, and ate again.

383
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,580
And your eyes were always empty.

384
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:54,080
After about a month passed like that, I asked you if you would try to do this job.

385
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,970
You nodded, without even asking what kind of work it was. Why could that be?

386
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:05,820
For some reason, I thought that you could do this job well.

387
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,230
Inside of your empty eyes,

388
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,340
I saw anger.

389
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:25,650
I was just... really hungry.

390
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:30,770
Living is just like that. Even if you want to die, even if you're angry, or sad,

391
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:34,560
even if you're suffering, you're just hungry.

392
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,600
Then you need to eat.

393
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,930
But, Brother, was I really living?

394
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,610
Woo Cheon, stop here.

395
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:55,060
Let's turn that woman in, and don't look back. If this doesn't end with me,

396
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,940
the issue will grow.

397
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,240
There's someone that saved me,

398
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,740
but I had no reason to live then.

399
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:08,070
There's no reason to life!

400
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:14,170
But... now a reason has appeared.

401
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:29,060
The guy you told me about before, it looks like he went to the same gambling house as Ha Yong Geun.

402
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,060
Really?

403
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,800
And I heard that they fought once.

404
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,000
- An employee of mine said that. 
 - And the evidence?

405
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,230
In a way, there's a witness.

406
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:42,160
Is there no kind of CCTV there?

407
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,920
Hyungnim, who would put a CCTV in a place with illegal activities?

408
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,480
That's true. Good for them.

409
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,820
Set up a witness, so we can call them.

410
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,500
Yes.

411
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,420
Did you find anything?

412
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,630
Could Min Woo Cheon be the culprit?

413
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,460
He is a strong suspect.

414
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:13,090
How much of that can we believe? Coincidence, destiny.

415
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,150
We can't.

416
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:16,870
So do you think it was all a lie?

417
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:20,870
He coincidentally brought a passed-out child to a house with the lights turned on,

418
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:27,080
and in the pictures hung inside that house, he saw the child that saved him when he was young.

419
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,790
So he went to find that girl, but she was terminally ill.

420
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:33,220
I'm sure there's some sort of causality there, perhaps in a different arrangement than he claims.

421
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:37,690
Arrangement. Will the order be different or the intervals?

422
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,310
The focus keeps falling on her. Pyo In Sook.

423
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:44,260
The abuse victim's daughter and the suspect, Min Woo Cheon,

424
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,730
that woman is between the two of them.

425
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,350
Wait a second.

426
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,550
Is there something wrong?

427
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:07,390
No, I just have a few things to ask.

428
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,770
Why didn't you say that you had the phone?

429
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:14,550
I don't even know your phone number.

430
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:17,750
And you didn't tell me to let you know if I found it.

431
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:22,370
It turns out that it was in a junk pile at grandma's house.

432
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:26,160
Sometimes, I steal and sell things that are somewhat useful.

433
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:31,240
Grandma said that I could take what I needed, and it was originally my dad's.

434
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,610
- So you went to sell it? 
 - Yes.

435
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:38,530
But since it was soaked in water, it didn't even turn on,

436
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:43,270
so... I threw it away.

437
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,230
Where was that?

438
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,990
A trashcan at the market.

439
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,920
Why would the phone be here?

440
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,610
I mean.

441
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,490
I'm telling you, it's not the time for us to be here.

442
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,900
The phone is nothing, the important thing is

443
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:09,640
Min Woo Cheon went to the same gambling house as Ha Yong Geun. I'm telling you, it's that jerk!

444
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,410
And that gambling house's worker was a witness?

445
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:13,340
Yes! No doubt!

446
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:16,990
Look through all of this, and then summon the witness.

447
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,850
Look through it all...

448
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,860
 Unnie.

449
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,110
 Are you looking for this?

450
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,670
 It was you, wasn't it?

451
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,250
 I'm sorry.

452
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:30,140
 I... killed him.

453
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,810
 It's okay.

454
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:34,680
 I said it 100 times,

455
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,270
 it would be nice if my dad disappeared.

456
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:42,520
 Every night I prayed that a car accident or something would happen.

457
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:48,660
 Unnie, where are you staying?

458
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,450
 Where have you been?

459
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,560
 Hospice.

460
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,240
 What?

461
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,710
 I... I'm dying.

462
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:08,750
 What are you talking about?

463
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:13,750
 They say it's cancer, so I can't live longer than a few months.

464
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,500
 Why?

465
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,150
 Why?

466
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,790
 What kind of nonsense is that?

467
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:36,210
 I know, right? What kind of nonsense is that?

468
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:38,270
 No!

469
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:29,260
 I heard that you came here to find the phone, did you leave in the morning to find it too?

470
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,740
 Because I was worried about my grandma, did you think it was there?

471
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,670
 It wasn't there.

472
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,370
 Where is the phone?

473
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:43,120
 Woo Cheon came here to find it, we'll all die if he can't find it...

474
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:54,610
 Oppa, after the bazaar, how about we shoot fireworks in the evening?

475
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:58,190
 If it's not too much for the patients, that sounds good.

476
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:01,510
 Really? I really like fireworks!

477
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,570
 Then we definitely have to do it.

478
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:07,960
But... where could the phone have gone?

479
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,480
It's Woo Cheon, I'm telling you.

480
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:16,500
Now that I think of it, that might be for the better.

481
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,760
It'll be a no-brainer if a hit-man possesses key evidence.

482
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:26,020
But what is she doing over there?

483
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,650
- Hey, what are you doing over there? 
 - What?

484
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,820
You found it?

485
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,120
Yeah.

486
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:39,580
What? So... San Ah knows everything?

487
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:43,550
Yeah, it turns out she remembered.

488
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:49,150
Wait, but... if she tells the police, we're all done for!

489
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:53,180
If she was going to tell the police, why would she have given In Sook the phone?

490
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,850
She's a kid...

491
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:58,530
How long could a kid hold out for?

492
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:03,700
But why did you say you didn't have it? Were you planning on giving it to Woo Cheon?

493
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:09,960
That's supposed to be important to Woo Cheon. So were you planning on not telling us, and giving it to him?

494
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:24,530
 So it was all a lie... It was all a lie, wasn't it?

495
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:28,750
 But still, I felt you were a wriggling earthworm

496
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,980
 and I did so because I didn't want you to be trampled to death...

497
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,040
 But it all ended up being a lie.

498
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:40,060
 Murderer? I killed someone, too. Just two murderers hanging out. Isn't that funny?

499
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:04,340
Where are you going? Are you planning to leave?

500
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:08,500
The wind is quite strong outside, you should dress warmly.

501
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,720
Don't say useless things.

502
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,840
Don't talk to me. Don't say things that are meaningless either.

503
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:19,030
Do you know why I'm saying meaningless things?

504
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,280
What?

505
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,320
Because I can't say things that are meaningful.

506
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:30,110
Now whenever I see you, I can't think of anything but a scene of you killing someone.

507
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:34,530
How many people have you killed? How did you kill them?

508
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:39,040
What did you do after killing them?

509
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:42,390
I ate.

510
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:48,860
I ate, and slept, and opened my eyes...

511
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,110
That's what I did.

512
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:59,510
That's right, I killed someone too.

513
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:05,690
In reality, I had no thoughts after killing him. I felt comforted that San Ah could be happy.

514
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:12,900
But even still, if you kill someone, you lose one thing.

515
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,220
You're empty as if you have a hole somewhere.

516
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:18,000
I'm like that, as it turns out.

517
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,880
How much would you have lost?

518
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:27,700
Could there be anything left inside of you?

519
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:31,250
There was nothing.

520
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:38,130
So, it's possible that... I may have searched relentlessly for the reason.

521
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:42,100
How much of a bad guy I am, how much I deserve to die.

522
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,400
I found the reason while searching every corner.

523
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,860
But even then, in the end, I killed people.

524
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:53,530
People with eyes.

525
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,090
So, I'm so scared.

526
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:04,530
The fact that I can't turn back, no matter what. I can't be forgiven,

527
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:08,870
that I, in this state, should not like you.

528
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:16,760
I, in this state... cannot like you.

529
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:45,800
So this is how things turned out. I'm scared of you now.

530
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:51,240
Get lost.

531
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,990
Disappear from my sight.

532
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:15,450
So, the man that you saw at the gambling house,

533
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:17,160
is this man.

534
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,610
Right?

535
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:23,080
This person, well, he didn't come very often.

536
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,490
But anyway, they fought hard over a money problem.

537
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:31,460
I think he said something like, "If you don't pay up, I'll kill you."

538
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:35,470
Huh? He said he would kill him?

539
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:37,390
- Yes. 
 - Wow...

540
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:39,140
This man was a regular customer,

541
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,460
was that the only time he had a problem like that?

542
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,420
Hard to say.

543
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:50,020
This guy sure is scary, talking about killing someone...

544
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,480
How was he with these people?

545
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:57,560
Who are all of these guys?

546
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,640
I don't really remember...

547
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:03,890
But they're all people that had altercations with or fought Ha Yong Geun at the gambling house.

548
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:08,890
While not being able to remember these people, it seems like you remember this person clearly.

549
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:14,000
No, because he didn't see any of these guys, he saw him!

550
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,080
He said he saw him... what are...?

551
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:22,500
Apparently, this guy even had a knife...

552
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,930
My goodness. Look at this...

553
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:33,360
Nobody would buy this. Give me a $1 discount. Because it's me, I said I'll buy it.

554
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,620
Why are you being like that?

555
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:38,620
Why is that grandmother doing that?

556
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:41,990
Because items will be released in the bazaar,

557
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:44,400
she is selling them diligently.

558
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,170
She's addicted to buying and selling used things.

559
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:51,160
Our hospice's image is getting ruined because of that grandmother.

560
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:55,000
She's horrible. She asks for huge discounts or ghosts people.

561
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,500
She's like that because she's lonely.

562
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,170
Buying and selling something continuously

563
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:03,680
can help her meet people.

564
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,600
She is creating work.

565
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:12,260
- Did you not sell it again? 
 - That woman was creating a fuss to reduce the price for a dollar and finding defects.

566
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:15,240
Is it not because you don't want to sell it?

567
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,320
I feel that way sometimes.

568
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,610
Memories remain in the items.

569
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:24,070
This must be the dress I wore when I met that person.

570
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:29,070
This was a gift from that person... something like that.

571
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:31,090
The air that day...

572
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:35,010
I remember the smell also.

573
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:37,460
That's why I can't throw it away.

574
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:40,600
When I gave birth to my son...

575
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,700
For the first time, I bought flowers and fixed them

576
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,340
- in this vase. 
 - Grandma, you have a son?

577
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:48,220
Then, why did he not visit even once?

578
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:50,700
Even the son abandoned her.

579
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:57,160
- Honey... 
 - Woo Cheon, we are making dalgona. 
  (Korean candy made with melted sugar and baking soda.)

580
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,770
Come here.

581
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,130
- What is it? 
  - This....

582
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:10,100
She went out to sell this but brought it back as it is.

583
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:14,010
Can't you sell it to me?

584
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:16,500
How are you going to use it?

585
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,770
At the most important place in the world...

586
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:21,710
Is that so?

587
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,580
Then, you can have it.

588
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:28,930
How much is it?

589
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:32,540
Nevermind. Just use it.

590
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,580
Oh, you are the best!

591
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,790
She never gave anything to me...

592
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:44,560
- Hey. Oh my gosh. What is this? 
 - Everyone together.

593
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:49,070
Blood. He's bleeding.

594
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:52,430
It's because he is not sleeping enough. I am so sad.

595
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:57,180
My goodness, my kid. What'll we do?

596
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:02,460
Goodness.

597
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:16,580
Hurry! Hurry!

598
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:34,340

599
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:39,090
Unni.

600
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,020
Oppa sent me firecrackers.

601
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,890
To practice tonight.

602
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:47,530
- It must be nice. 
 - Yeah.

603
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:50,430
Woo Cheon fainted.

604
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:52,310
Why?

605
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:53,980
I don't know.

606
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:59,990
I still really think it could've turned out for the better.

607
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:02,530
A hitman at a crime scene?

608
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:04,950
It fits perfectly.

609
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,640
I don't know what In Sook is thinking.

610
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,040
If he's someone she shouldn't like, then she should stop. What else can be done?

611
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,250
Would it be easy if it were you?

612
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:15,910
It's would be easier than falling in love with a murderer.

613
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:22,000
Are there people we shouldn't fall in love with?

614
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,920
Of course. Murderers.

615
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:29,350
- We also killed a person. 
 - No, that's not right.

616
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:32,310
I think the situation is getting complicated now.

617
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:35,280
You should get this right. If the detectives comes to question us,

618
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,660
Woo Cheon killed that guy.

619
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:42,000
We should bring In Sook back to her senses and have her match our words.

620
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:53,970
- What is it? 
 - His wound is infected, and it ruptured.

621
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:58,260
The infection was pretty deep because the wound wasn't taken care of properly.

622
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:59,560
He didn't even sleep well for days.

623
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,570
He said he had insomnia.

624
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:05,270
We should've prescribed some sleeping pills.

625
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:09,360
What is this?

626
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:15,000
Look at his strength. Why is he holding on to this?

627
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,070

What's this? This is my handwriting.

628
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:02,480
What is this? Why is it with you?

629
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:04,520
What?

630
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:07,930
I threw this away. This is my handwriting. Why is it with you?

631
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:10,040
You... wrote this?

632
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,670
Who are you?

633
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:14,140
Did you follow me? From when? Why?

634
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:16,890
Why is everything unexplainable?

635
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:18,530
I picked it up.

636
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:21,150
Pick up? You picked this up?

637
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:23,560
What I had written? Coincidentally?

638
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,640
Yes.

639
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,680
Does that make sense? You coincidentally picked up what I threw away.

640
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:32,530
- Coincidentally, you came to the place where I killed a person.... 
 - There are people here.

641
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:37,930
Are you all right?

642
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:05,750
I am sorry.

643
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:12,500
Me liking you

644
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,620
has become something you fear.

645
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:19,060
So, I am sorry.

646
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:24,210
Then you take responsibility. You can take the blame for everything.

647
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,540
- Hello. Hi. 
 - How pretty.

648
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,380
Hi, welcome.

649
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:53,880
The lights are so pretty.

650
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,980
Sisters.

651
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,050
Unnies, will you light up firecrackers?

652
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,500
I shouldn't shoot this at a person, right?

653
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:09,850
Of course not. Be careful.

654
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:11,640
Se Yeon, here you go.

655
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,630
I am scared of this.

656
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,140

657
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:56,260
It's good that you're at the hospice. If you stay with your daughter, you'll ruin her.

658
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:59,090
Here you go.

659
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:02,890
- Do it properly, please. Gosh!! 
 - If I make everything well, it wouldn't be popular.

660
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:06,680
- Make it quickly. Hurry. 
 - Would you like some vegetable pancakes?

661
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,790
- Please work hard today. 
 - Yes.

662
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:12,740

663
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:16,440
- You are here. 
 - Ji Pyo, you must've worked hard.

664
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,080
Hello. Head in.

665
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:24,110
Everything looks nice, right. It looks delicious.

666
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:26,430
I want to try that.

667
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:31,170
You look so beautiful!

668
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:35,210
Oh, it's so pretty.

669
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:39,100
Looks like when sunlight reflects off the water in a lake.

670
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:43,400
- This too. 
 - I will try this once...

671
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,200
It doesn't fit.

672
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,930
- Little finger. 
 - Oh, here?

673
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:51,290
It looks good.

674
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:54,240
 That I cannot reverse everything.

675
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,850
 That I cannot be forgiven.

676
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:59,730
 That I cannot like you now.

677
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:04,900
 That a person like me shouldn't be liking you.

678
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:16,360
The bazaar has started.

679
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:18,850
Let's go out.

680
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,290
Yes.

681
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:23,430
Okay, got it.

682
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:25,630
Team Leader, I'll go to the Forensic Service Center.

683
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:29,160
DNA of a probable suspect was detected from the scar of the corpse.

684
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,730
Then, let's go...

685
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:34,010
Just go. Go.

686
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:37,730
He does all the important things alone.

687
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:40,940
- "Ji"? 
 - We are the same age. 
 (T/N: Ji - informal/impolite form of He)

688
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:43,610
We are all the same age, aren't we?

689
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:53,230
That was funny. Same age? As if.

690
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:01,650
How is this?

691
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,970
It's all right.

692
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:07,550
Come again!

693
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,510
Miss!

694
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:14,340
Sung Mi Do!

695
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:20,740
- Hello. 
 - I'm here.

696
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:23,330
Hello.

697
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:25,540
Have a look before you go.

698
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:36,060
Have a look.

699
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:06,450
Are you selling this?

700
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,730
How much is it?

701
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:12,480
At first, I also thought that it was murder using a blunt weapon.

702
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,630
To figure out the golf club model, I focused on the scar on his head

703
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:18,960
and I found someone else's DNA there.

704
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,870
- Was it a mark of defense? 
 - It's not that.

705
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:24,890
Considering that it was found on the spot where the blunt object hit the head,

706
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:29,520
I thought it could have been from the serration part of the bottom of the grip.

707
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,900
It looks like sunscreen.

708
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:36,480
- Sunscreen? 
 - Someone who applied sunscreen touched the serration on the grip.

709
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,730
Because it's sunscreen, it was not washed off by the rain.

710
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:45,160
I've done the discharge procedure. Let's go home.

711
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:48,290
Let me go! I'm not going!

712
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:50,910
I know. I understand.

713
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:53,760
I'm sorry that I couldn't take care of you although you're sick.

714
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,840
I'll do all of it now.

715
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:00,430
I know you're only acting sensitive because you're sick.

716
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:03,490
Let's get a divorce.

717
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:06,770
- What? 
 - I want a divorce.

718
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:12,300
I want to get divorced, get the assets I could get, and leave them to my mom.

719
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:13,570
What are you talking about?

720
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:15,660
No matter how I say it, you never understood what I say.

721
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:18,580
- That's why let's divorce— 
 - How is that a reason for divorce?

722
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:19,810
Did I do something wrong?

723
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:21,110
Did I ever hit you?

724
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:22,790
Did I cheat on you?

725
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:26,410
Do you think this makes sense? Do you think that's a reason for divorce?

726
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:30,170
- Let's just go home. Let's go home for now. 
 - I don't want to.

727
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:32,540
- Let's just please go home! 
 - I said I won't go!

728
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:34,260
- Let's go. 
 - I won't!

729
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,670
- Let's go, okay? 
 - Let me go.

730
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:38,360
- Let me go. 
 - Let's go. 
 - I don't want to! I said no!

731
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,280
Let's just go, please.

732
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:46,570
- She said she's not going. 
 - Who are you?

733
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:49,340
- Whoever (she needs). 
 - What?

734
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:55,140
Let's go. Let's just go.

735
00:58:57,570 --> 00:58:59,940
She got him.

736
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:02,290
Just quietly leave.

737
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,730
Once the results come out, we'll have to compare the DNA with those of the people around Ha Yeong Geun

738
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:16,120
so make sure to get swabs from everyone, neighbors, family members, and people he's been in contact with.

739
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,600
I think we'll need to get Min Woo Cheon's, too.

740
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,530
I already got it.

741
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:32,620
What am I fighting for?

742
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:37,260
That's right, my husband didn't do anything wrong.

743
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:43,860
Faithful head of the family, husband, filial son...

744
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:47,530
But that faithful head of the family, husband, and filial son

745
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:49,810
doesn't want to give you any money?

746
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:54,410
Because we are a family. He said he will take care of it.

747
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:56,810
You don't trust him, right?

748
00:59:57,410 --> 00:59:59,840
Why did you marry such a person?

749
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:02,360
Because it was a decent time.

750
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:05,980
He was a decent person.

751
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:08,710
I just lived a decent life.

752
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,760
Because I just wanted to hide.

753
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:17,410
From when did it all start to distort?

754
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:19,100
Was it after marriage

755
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:23,360
when I was fired for being married and stayed locked up at home?

756
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:30,660
Or when we lost our first and second child?

757
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:36,300
Or when my mother-in-law moved in when she was sick and my husband started going out?

758
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,100
Or maybe...

759
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:41,630
Was it way before that?

760
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:51,570

761
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:13,430
For now, he left. Because he needs to decide, he wants some more time.

762
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:17,570
Your husband was very worried.

763
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:20,920
By the way, where did Woo Cheon go?

764
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,400
He quit.

765
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,200
He left last night.

766
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:28,810
I think he just gave a bunch of his belongings, I mean they're just garbage, to Ji Woo and then he left.

767
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,760
Over there.

768
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:36,980
- Mom! Look at this! 
 - Wow.

769
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:49,560
Let's go to the hospice for now.

770
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:10,220
A bird called the satin bowerbird

771
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:14,580
only collects blue things to express its love for its female counterpart.

772
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:20,190
Woo Cheon collected stuff like this every day.

773
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:24,510
These are all of Woo Cheon's possessions.

774
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:30,800
He said his whole life only amounts to this.

775
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:58,270

776
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:11,030
♫  It won't take long now  ♫

777
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:18,200
♫  The day this pain will end  ♫

778
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:24,260
♫  Won't you look back on yesterday  ♫

779
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:31,800
♫  Covered in a long night, I live today again  ♫

780
01:05:31,850 --> 01:05:37,960
♫  A long night  ♫

781
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:41,400
♫  If everything passes and disappears,  ♫

782
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:45,640
♫  Will it be erased, then?  ♫

783
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,150
 I'm sorry.

784
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:56,920
 This time, I'll be the one who'll save you.

785
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:05,830
♫  Yesterday's you is getting darker day by day  ♫

786
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:12,880
♫  Because it's a long-time dream, I want to reach  ♫

787
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:19,090
♫  Even though I know you'll lose me and get hurt  ♫

788
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:26,820
♫  Even in this breathless moment, I ran to you  ♫

789
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:31,220

790
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:32,540
 So, please, I ask of you this one time.

791
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:34,090
 Take care of that girl.

792
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:36,960
 You know things like a bucket list? I did everything on that.

793
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,720
 Did you kill Ha Yeon Geun? 
 - Yes.

794
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,660
 I think I was humiliated. I sent myself to that room.

795
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:42,890
 Looks like you like golf.

796
01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:45,630
