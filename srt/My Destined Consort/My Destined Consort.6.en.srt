22
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,620
Hexiang,

23
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:43,930
first question.

24
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,450
Five years ago,

25
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,890
did you know about Tai

26
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,300
pushing someone

27
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,330
out of the carriage?

28
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,330
Second question.

29
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,660
Were you involved in this?

30
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,450
Who was the mastermind

31
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,660
behind it?

32
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,380
Hexiang,

33
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:25,730
don't be afraid.

34
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,540
I'm here today.

35
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,700
Just tell the truth

36
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,490
about what happened back then.

37
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,450
This...

38
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,220
Please speak freely, Mr. Song.

39
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,540
Hexiang said

40
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,700
that it was Consort Danling

41
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,770
who instructed Tai

42
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,210
to push Consort Jiangli

43
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,770
off the carriage,

44
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,380
but he accidentally

45
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,680
pushed the princess instead.

46
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,040
However, Consort Danling said

47
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:17,980
it was

48
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,980
no big deal

49
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,100
and just went along with it

50
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,300
to incite conflict

51
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,280
between the princess
and Consort Jiangli.

52
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,570
That can't be true.

53
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,730
Consort Danling is kind,

54
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,050
gentle, and generous.

55
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,610
How could she do
such a despicable thing?

56
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,860
Mr. Song,

57
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,890
this is of great importance.

58
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,700
You must be careful with your words.

59
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,050
If I tell even half a lie,

60
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,050
I'm willing to give up
all my good fortune.

61
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:48,940
Mr. Song.

62
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:56,770
Qingqing.

63
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,050
It's not like this, Qingqing.

64
00:03:59,050 --> 00:03:59,890
Sister Ling,

65
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,300
all these years,

66
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,300
you've always treated me like a fool.

67
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,010
No.

68
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,100
I didn't.

69
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,170
Hexiang,

70
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,450
do you know the crime
of slandering a consort?

71
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,020
How many guts and lives do you have

72
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,180
to dare to slander me?

73
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,340
Wang Danling,

74
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:18,940
stop denying it.

75
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,340
Qingqing,

76
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,400
listen to me. It wasn't me.

77
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,380
- It was them.
- Let go.

78
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,930
- They're slandering me.
- Let go.

79
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,460
Qingqing,

80
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,020
you must believe me.

81
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,020
I will find the evidence

82
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,330
to prove my innocence.

83
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,140
You just wait.

84
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,380
Wang Danling.

85
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,140
All these years,

86
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,470
I've treated her

87
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,940
like a real sister,

88
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:22,980
but unexpectedly...

89
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,290
Since I brought the medicine,

90
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,180
I never intended to take it back.

91
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,170
Jiangli,

92
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:34,980
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,270
Rather than calling me Jiangli,

94
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,380
you'd better call me Shen Jiangli.

95
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,540
Jingming,

96
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,650
what should I do?

97
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,700
I've been misled by the spiteful,

98
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,480
and I've been against Jiangli for years.

99
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,290
It's not just you.

100
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,410
We all misunderstood her.

101
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,290
From now on,

102
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,060
we can make it right.

103
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,060
Jingming, wait.

104
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,490
Well.

105
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,630
Here's the crab roe puff for you.

106
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,540
Jiangli.

107
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,780
Are you mad?

108
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,620
Stop pretending to care about me.

109
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,650
Why did you let Wang Danling go?

110
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,450
Why didn't you send her to the Prefect

111
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,700
so the truth can come to light?

112
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,890
What? Do you feel sorry for her?

113
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:00,990
Have you thought about it?

114
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,140
General Wang and Jingxiu

115
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,080
are behind Wang Danling.

116
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,890
Do you remember the ceremony?

117
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,310
If we don't have a sure way to win,

118
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,360
it's better to remain still for now.

119
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,420
Wang Danling

120
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,910
is General Wang's only daughter.

121
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,850
No matter what she did wrong,

122
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,820
Jingxiu and the Wang family

123
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,180
will use all their power

124
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,330
to protect her.

125
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,620
If the spiteful

126
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,450
add fuel to the fire

127
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,820
and twist it into a brotherly dispute,

128
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,940
things will get complicated.

129
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,060
Even if we have Tai and Hexiang,

130
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,380
we could still be accused

131
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,290
of bribing witnesses.

132
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,140
Sometimes, the truth

133
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,940
doesn't matter that much.

134
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,800
Even if Father believes us,

135
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,210
he'll still have his considerations.

136
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,610
Alright.

137
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,020
I understand now.

138
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:58,820
If this matter

139
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,620
is exposed now,

140
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,890
it'll be just like the ceremony,

141
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,490
which seemed to be serious

142
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,800
yet caused her little harm.

143
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,650
Since you know everything,

144
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,240
why are you still mad at me?

145
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,620
Do you want to see my attitude?

146
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,610
You've misunderstood me for years
because of this.

147
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,610
Just because the misunderstanding
is cleared,

148
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,290
should I immediately forgive you,

149
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,970
smile, say it's fine,

150
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,140
and let everything go?

151
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,100
By the way,

152
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:32,980
this is for you.

153
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,220
What's this?

154
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:36,810
It's from Qingqing.

155
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:38,650
She kept saying

156
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:39,980
she brought this for me,

157
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,340
but she knows

158
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,100
I don't like crab roe puffs.

159
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,740
You two are truly siblings.

160
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,570
There's one more thing.

161
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,410
Mother is about to celebrate
her birthday soon.

162
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,570
I'd like to buy some things.

163
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,510
I wonder if Consort Jiangli

164
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,840
would be willing to accompany me.

165
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,410
Just have Yunyi and Yunjiu

166
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,380
go with you.

167
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,690
Those two rough men
don't know such things.

168
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,530
Let's go.

169
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,140
(Since Wang Danling)

170
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,290
(instructed Tai to do this,)

171
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,740
(it's not hard to guess)

172
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,290
(she must also)

173
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,700
(manage to poison Lady Shu.)

174
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,810
(Wang Danling made such a huge mistake)

175
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,080
(yet couldn't be brought down,)

176
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,460
(which shows
that in the Prefect's Mansion,)

177
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,570
(there's no right or wrong,)

178
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,570
(and only strength matters.)

179
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,050
(Now, Lu Jingming and I)

180
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,970
(have cleared the misunderstandings.)

181
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,290
(Once I get the Lei Pill,)

182
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,570
(I can leave with Yanyan asap.)

183
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:02,620
(Shen Mansion)

184
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:30,740
(Shen Qilan)

185
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:39,780
(Guardian of the Nation)

186
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,460
Master,

187
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,930
how can you still be in mood

188
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,440
to play with birds at a time like this?

189
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,380
(Shen Zhengshan)
Master.

190
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,140
Master, come and sit.

191
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,020
Come and sit.

192
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,350
(Zou Jiaoyue, Shen's concubine)
Master, I heard

193
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,690
that since Jiangli returned
from the ancestral tomb,

194
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,020
Master Jingming has been spoiling her.

195
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,020
This side.

196
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,300
As for Qilan's marriage,

197
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,780
you should also pay attention to it.

198
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,740
Now is the best time to act.

199
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,140
Master,

200
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,980
why not visit Master Jingming's Mansion

201
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,060
more often?

202
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,220
I'm not going.

203
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,740
Jiangli has been confined
to the ancestral tomb for five years.

204
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,940
She's already been abandoned.

205
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,160
How could she still be favored?

206
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,860
Don't listen to the gossip

207
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,700
of those common folk.

208
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,020
You can find out

209
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,660
whether it's true for yourself

210
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,500
by visiting them.

211
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,780
I won't go.

212
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,380
This unfilial daughter

213
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,620
didn't even bother to visit me
after returning.

214
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,940
How could I go see her first?

215
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,540
What would others think of me?

216
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,940
Well,

217
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,420
if you won't visit them,

218
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,020
you can at least visit the Prefect's Mansion.

219
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,900
Qilan is our biological daughter.

220
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,660
You should think more

221
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,980
about her

222
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,460
and our family.

223
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,980
(Guardian of the Nation)

224
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,740
Children will have their own blessings.

225
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,460
Father, Mother,

226
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,820
on this hot summer day,

227
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,040
the best way to cool off
is to have some qingtuan.

228
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,860
Fuling will bring them over to you soon.

229
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,500
I made them early this morning.

230
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,100
I hope you'll like them.

231
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,020
Master,

232
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,740
look at how graceful
and elegant Qilan is.

233
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,180
In my opinion,

234
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,100
she's much better than Shen Jiangli

235
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,460
and deserves to find a good husband.

236
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,060
Don't you think so, Master?

237
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,060
Master,

238
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,300
say something.

239
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,940
Master,

240
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,420
isn't that right?

241
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,620
Qilan,

242
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,780
come with me to celebrate

243
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,400
Lady Shu's birthday in a few days.

244
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,620
You and Jiangli

245
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,060
haven't seen each other in a while.

246
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,500
It'll be good for you to catch up.

247
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,700
I'll make sure
not to embarrass you and Jiangli.

248
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,140
Qilan,

249
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,700
at Lady Shu's birthday banquet,

250
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,620
there will be many noble young masters.

251
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,860
Remember what I've told you.

252
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,060
You must behave.

253
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,060
I'll give you

254
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,140
extra money from the household

255
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,780
to buy some fine jewelry.

256
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,180
Make sure to dress yourself up.

257
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,820
I know.

258
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:31,460
(Guardian of the Nation)

259
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,140
(Shen Xiaolan,)

260
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,460
(run away.)

261
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,900
(You're free now.)

262
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,580
Alright, go in.

263
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,740
Trinkets!

264
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,620
Freshly made delicious buns!

265
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,220
(Fuling, Shen Qilan's maid)

266
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,540
What a nice day.

267
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,230
Sir,

268
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,300
two jin of beef,

269
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,340
and a pot of wine.

270
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,660
Do you want it?

271
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,740
(Tian's Snacks)
Please help me.

272
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,280
- Get out.
- Please give me some food.

273
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,900
- No. Just go.
- I've starved for days.

274
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,760
- Go.
- Sir.

275
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,770
You want four lamb buns, right?

276
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,560
Give me two.

277
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,940
Wonton!

278
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,960
Big and delicious wonton!

279
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,740
Thank you, Miss.

280
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,220
Thank you, Miss.

281
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,110
Buns!

282
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,140
My Lady,

283
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,740
that man is obviously a fraud.

284
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,820
Buns!

285
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,100
How many things in this world

286
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,940
can we really see clearly?

287
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,500
But I've seen him

288
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,820
begging in several places.

289
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,980
He's definitely not a beggar.

290
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,740
Well, that means

291
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,220
this is how he makes a living.

292
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,580
Anyway, being kind

293
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,580
is never wrong.

294
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,780
Remember that.

295
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,300
Sure.

296
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,340
I'll buy it for you.

297
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,160
- What a beauty.
- What are you doing?

298
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,580
Why are you resisting?

299
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,320
I like it when you resist like this.

300
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,220
Come with us.

301
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,220
Let go.

302
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,020
Step aside.

303
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,400
- Don't touch me.
- Step aside.

304
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,700
Let go.

305
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,060
Everyone, look.

306
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,520
This has nothing to do with me.

307
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,420
Hurry, Fuling.

308
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,460
Hurry.

309
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:39,900
My Lady.

310
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,380
It looks like there's an accident.

311
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,220
- Are you okay?
- My Lady, let's go.

312
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,380
- Canvas!
- It hurts.

313
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,400
Give me the handkerchief.

314
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,380
Hang on.

315
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,460
I think you should

316
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,460
get your wound bandaged
at the clinic ahead.

317
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,050
Alright.

318
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,980
Here.

319
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,060
Thank you for saving me.

320
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,340
Take care.

321
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,100
Miss.

322
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,780
Being kind.

323
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,300
Wonton!

324
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,140
Is it tasty?

325
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,630
Big and delicious wonton!

326
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,500
- Let's go.
- Wait.

327
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,340
Come on, let's help.

328
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,860
Trinkets!

329
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,260
Look over there.

330
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,940
It's really beautiful.

331
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,260
Try it.

332
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,420
Take a skewer.

333
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,060
It's tasty.

334
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,660
This is the shop I told you about.

335
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,260
It's a new ready-made garment shop,

336
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,820
and they have a lot of Shu brocade

337
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,690
that other shops in the city don't.

338
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,100
My Lady.

339
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,260
My Lady.

340
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,320
Fuling,

341
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,260
go tell the shopkeeper

342
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,460
to bring out the latest stock.

343
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,540
Just buy the expensive ones.

344
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,380
Got it.

345
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,470
I'm going to Moon Jewelry

346
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,380
to buy some jewelry.

347
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,320
Let's go.

348
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,980
My Lady, how about this one?

349
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,940
What about this one?

350
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,580
You're like peach blossoms;
it suits you.

351
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,300
Too vulgar.

352
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,740
Do you like it?

353
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,140
It's yours then.

354
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,300
Thank you, My Lady.

355
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,100
This one's also pretty.

356
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,700
Greetings, Consort Danling.

357
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,300
I just saw you enter.

358
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,820
Your beauty is unparalleled,

359
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,100
shining like pearls and jade.

360
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,620
I think

361
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,460
this hairpin suits you the best.

362
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,050
You're more sensible than your sister.

363
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,980
Jiangli and I

364
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,900
are always on good terms.

365
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,700
Your sister

366
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,020
has always respected and cared for me
as her sister-in-law.

367
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,930
In the past,

368
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,580
she even used to help me with my hair.

369
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,940
Yes.

370
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,620
I heard it's a skill passed down
from Consort Jiangli's family.

371
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,300
If your sister is so good at this,

372
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,620
then it must be
an easy pie for you, right?

373
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,100
It's an honor for me

374
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,220
to help you with your hair.

375
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,620
Consort Danling, would you like it

376
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,620
this way?

377
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,740
How about this?

378
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,420
It's fine.

379
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,340
Your sister's skill is

380
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,100
a little better than yours.

381
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,620
You should

382
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,340
learn more from her in the future.

383
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,820
Of course, I'm also

384
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,980
willing to give you some guidance.

385
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,540
This one

386
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,860
- is for you.
- As a concubine's daughter,

387
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,100
- Thanks...
- it's an honor

388
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,300
for her to help with your hair.

389
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,240
Thank you, Consort Danling.

390
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:11,020
(Garment Shop)

391
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,030
They're all trinkets.

392
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,620
Ms. Jiangli.

393
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,480
(Garment Shop)
Master Jingming, Consort Danling.

394
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,220
Master Jingming, Consort Danling,

395
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,180
your visit

396
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,740
truly honors our humble shop.

397
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,700
Master Jingming,
the outfits you ordered last time

398
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,860
have been completed.

399
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,860
Please try them on in the fitting room.

400
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,140
Sure.

401
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,180
Jingming, good for you.

402
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,380
With such a busy schedule,

403
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,860
you still have time to order clothes.

404
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,300
Customizing clothes for me

405
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,900
should be your responsibility,

406
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,620
but I understand

407
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,410
that you're not skilled in needlework,

408
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,620
so

409
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,800
I had to order it myself.

410
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,840
How do you know
I'm not skilled in needlework?

411
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,620
So, I must've misunderstood you.

412
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,280
I'll wait here.

413
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,580
You can take your time.

414
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,580
Master Jingming,

415
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,580
this way, please.

416
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,620
Master Jingming,

417
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,540
this outfit suits you perfectly.

418
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,220
If you wear this

419
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,500
while strolling through the city,

420
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,600
all the young ladies
won't take their eyes off you.

421
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,140
Consort Jiangli,

422
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,100
take a look.

423
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,180
Master Jingming looks

424
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,660
like a noble orchid and tree
under the moonlight in this.

425
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,380
What tree and moonlight?

426
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,420
To me,

427
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,980
it's just a black blur.

428
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,140
If it's for the birthday banquet,

429
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,700
this outfit won't do.

430
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,820
Sir, please

431
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,540
bring out something more bright.

432
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,860
Alright, alright.

433
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,860
This one's vibrant

434
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,720
and makes you
look even more noble and radiant.

435
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,060
Compared to this one,

436
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,540
the previous one

437
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,820
is indeed duller.

438
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,660
My Lady, thanks to you.

439
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,940
You know best

440
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,620
what kind of clothes
suit Master Jingming.

441
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,070
Jingming, have you ever heard

442
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,780
of a sacred bird called peacock

443
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,620
in the Fan Kingdom?

444
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,940
It's said

445
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,260
that when the male bird
is courting the female,

446
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,860
it spreads its enormous tail feathers

447
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,940
that glow brightly

448
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,120
and flaunts itself everywhere.

449
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,940
Although I've never seen this bird,

450
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,020
looking at you now,

451
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,460
I can almost see the bird.

452
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,340
Sure.

453
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,780
Consort Jiangli,

454
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,900
Master Jingming

455
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,900
have these clothes custom-made for you.

456
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,780
You can try them on later as well.

457
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,660
(So, he brought me here)

458
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,300
(to buy me clothes.)

459
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,980
How did you know my size?

460
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,820
I asked Yulan.

461
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,500
I thought

462
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,300
you should wear something presentable

463
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,100
at the birthday banquet.

464
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,660
I appreciate the thought,

465
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,520
but I don't want the clothes.

466
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,740
Master Jingming,

467
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,780
Consort Danling, take care.

468
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,420
You two have been married for years,

469
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,740
yet you're still so affectionate.

470
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,300
How enviable.

471
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,300
Jiangli.

472
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,180
Jiangli.

473
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,860
Greetings, Master Jingming.

474
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,600
Greetings, Consort Jiangli.

475
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:52,780
Qilan,

476
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,120
it's been years since we last met.

477
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,180
You've become so graceful and elegant.

478
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,980
I almost didn't recognize you.

479
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,010
Between us sisters,

480
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,460
you can still call me Jiangli

481
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,420
as before.

482
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,940
Jiangli,

483
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,940
how have you been

484
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,460
these past five years?

485
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,420
I've always wanted to visit,

486
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,860
but

487
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,780
father...

488
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,620
I know.

489
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,180
I understand why you couldn't come.

490
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,780
You need not feel bad about it.

491
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,180
We finally met today.

492
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,060
I'm just relieved to see

493
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,180
that you're so healthy today.

494
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,820
If you have time,

495
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,040
come to my house for a visit.

496
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,540
Father.

497
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,410
Father.

498
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,060
Master Jingming,

499
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,220
long time no see.

500
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,420
Is everything going well?

501
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,380
Everything's fine.

502
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,860
Father,

503
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,260
Jiangli is still here.

504
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:46,900
Jiangli.

505
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,100
I'm here today

506
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,020
to shop with my husband.

507
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,220
I didn't expect

508
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,660
to run into you here.

509
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,210
Jiangli,

510
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,060
you're back,

511
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,380
but you didn't even visit us.

512
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,020
You should bring Master Jingming

513
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,340
back to our home for a visit.

514
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,980
I've always let Jiangli take charge.

515
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,420
It's up to Jiangli.

516
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,660
If that's the case,

517
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,180
then today is the perfect day.

518
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,460
Why don't you...

519
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,300
No need.

520
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,300
I've been confined

521
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,100
at the ancestral tomb for five years,

522
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,040
yet you never once asked about me.

523
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,340
I thought

524
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,820
you had assumed I was dead.

525
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,220
Since that's the case,

526
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,900
please pretend I never came back.

527
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,400
Young Master,

528
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,240
the iron ore we're transporting

529
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,920
has been detained
by Master Jingxiu's men

530
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,580
at the city gate.

531
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,040
They claim we're smuggling minerals.

532
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,780
Understood.

533
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,820
I still have things to do.

534
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,120
I'll take my leave now.

535
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,580
I'll go with you.

536
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,380
Alright.

537
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,580
Goodbye, Master Jingming.

538
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,040
Goodbye, Consort Jiangli.

539
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,380
Father,

540
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,740
I also want to go to the city gate.

541
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,080
Qilan,

542
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,420
since when did you start enjoying
watching the commotion?

543
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,180
I'm worried that Jiangli

544
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,220
might need help.

545
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:57,900
Besides,

546
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,300
isn't this a good way to ease things

547
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,560
between Jiangli and our family?

548
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,420
You have a point.

549
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,940
Qilan, go ahead and have a look.

550
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,180
I won't get involved in this.

551
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,400
If it's about court matters
and they see me there,

552
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,580
I'll end up taking the blame.

553
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,280
I don't want to make trouble for myself.

554
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,540
I'll go home first.

555
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:12,980
Father, take care.

556
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,900
