22
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,250
I was born noble.

23
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,610
The position of Prefect's Wife
should be mine.

24
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,730
With your background,

25
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,060
how dare you compete with me?

26
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,780
You should stay in ancestral tomb
till you die.

27
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,450
Wang Danling,

28
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,060
why are you here?

29
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,330
To check on you.

30
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,020
Not bad.

31
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,680
This place matches
your status.

32
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:12,930
Wang Danling,

33
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,140
why did you set me up?

34
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,650
I didn't hurt
Qingqing's face.

35
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,700
I didn't drug Lady Shu.

36
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,050
I didn't drug

37
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,610
Master Jingxiu either.

38
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,330
So what if I wronged you?

39
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,260
Your humble origins
make you

40
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,860
unqualified to be
on equal footing with me.

41
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,770
We're both
consorts.

42
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,420
Why am I unqualified?

43
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,170
For I'm lineal daughter
of the Wang Family.

44
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,380
It gives you no right
to bully people.

45
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,330
Did I ever offend you?

46
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,700
Why did you
do this to me?

47
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,700
Why are you the one
by Ming's side?

48
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,050
Even if I, Wang Danling, reject it.

49
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,020
You're not entitled to claim it.

50
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,380
The rain is just in time.

51
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,010
Take her out.

52
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,100
What are you gonna do?

53
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,820
What are you gonna do?

54
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,820
Let go of me.

55
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,980
Let go of me.

56
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:36,890
Wang Danling.

57
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,980
You idiot deserves to be

58
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,700
stuck here for life.

59
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,890
You just won't stop
going against me.

60
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,420
If you hadn't come back,

61
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,860
the ceremony
carefully planned by me

62
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,860
wouldn't have been ruined.

63
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,050
Nanny Zhou

64
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,980
wouldn't have
died so miserably.

65
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,140
Died so miserably?

66
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,820
Who did she

67
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,500
take the blame for?

68
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,330
Why did you

69
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,060
plan the ceremony?

70
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,330
You haven't had any kids
all these years.

71
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,140
You should know why.

72
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,340
Wang Danling,

73
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,210
you have expertise

74
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,410
in Taoism.

75
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,820
How come you don't know

76
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,060
what goes around comes around?

77
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,210
Shen Jiangli, you!

78
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,580
Just to remind you.

79
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,940
Pretending a good guy
for so long,

80
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,530
you even forget

81
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,890
the tarnished deeds
you did.

82
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,330
The mask will

83
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:47,970
fall down one day.

84
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,700
Shen Jiangli,

85
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,870
Shen Jiangli,

86
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:54,890
stop there.

87
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,020
Shen Jiangli,

88
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,140
you're being
so sarcastic

89
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,180
and aggressive.

90
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,820
I don't think you just
want a fight

91
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,410
after getting me
and my husband here.

92
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,290
Show me whatever tricks
you've got left.

93
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,580
I have no more patience.

94
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,330
Shen Jiangli,

95
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,890
you can't do this to me.

96
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,130
Somebody, help!

97
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,330
Consort Jiangli pushed Consort Danling
into the water!

98
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,770
- Again.
- Something's wrong!

99
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,740
- Somebody!
- Help!

100
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,340
I'll go take a look.

101
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,610
Help,

102
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,820
help!

103
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:44,930
Help.

104
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,610
Wang Danling,

105
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,770
give me your hand.

106
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,700
Help.

107
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,540
Come on.

108
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,050
Let's go.

109
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,890
Go get the doctor.

110
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,530
If Consort Danling catches a cold,

111
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,940
you'll lose your heads.

112
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,780
Yes.

113
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,420
Jingming,

114
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,500
take a look at what your wife

115
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,450
did to Danling.

116
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,540
What happened?

117
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,100
I didn't push her.

118
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,850
She jumped into the water herself.

119
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,380
I jumped down to save her.

120
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,610
Let's go.

121
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,020
Jingming,

122
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,620
is this rule of Master Jingming's Mansion?

123
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,820
How dare your wife
push mine into the water?

124
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,770
It is outrageous!

125
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,330
Jiangli has said

126
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,180
she was there to help

127
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48,700
instead of pushing.

128
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,140
So you're indicating

129
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,450
that Danling told a lie?

130
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,670
You've gone way too far.

131
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,770
Who on earth lied?

132
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,690
Why don't we

133
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,530
meet in Prefect's Mansion.

134
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,100
Jingming,

135
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,650
is this a case of fury for your wife?

136
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,660
I don't dare to.

137
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,890
I just think

138
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,330
this is a big deal.

139
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,860
Maybe we should

140
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,500
ask Father to judge.

141
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,330
In my opinion,

142
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,580
Jiangli is such a smart girl.

143
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,700
Xiulan, your birthday

144
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,210
is really unforgettable.

145
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,660
Shen Jiangli, I don't think

146
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,890
you reflect on your mistakes
at ancestral tomb.

147
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,610
- Mother
- Jingming.

148
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,330
You wanna piss me off?

149
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:48,690
Shut up.

150
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,410
It's already a mess here.

151
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,450
Jiangli is my wife.

152
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,100
If anyone dares

153
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,500
to blame her here today

154
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,290
without any evidence.

155
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,210
Then as her husband,

156
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,850
I will be the first to object.

157
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,340
Father,

158
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,420
Danling,

159
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,860
Lady Shu,

160
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,940
I don't think it's fair

161
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,970
to jump to conclusions.

162
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,330
We'd better listen
to Jiangli's defense.

163
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,060
I agree, Father.

164
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,450
I also think

165
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,530
we should let
Jiangli explain

166
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,700
in case we misjudge her.

167
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,050
Jiangli,

168
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,530
what on earth is going on?

169
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,740
You tell me.

170
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,060
I didn't push Danling

171
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,570
but she jumped
into the water.

172
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,290
I was worried about her

173
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,140
so I jumped down to save her.

174
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,260
The weather is cold

175
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,810
and I can't swim.

176
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,980
How would I risk my life

177
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,050
to smear you?

178
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,620
I don't know

179
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,810
why you jumped into the water.

180
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,770
If I wanted to hurt you,

181
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,770
why did save you?

182
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:54,890
Jiangli,

183
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,220
why do you...

184
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,860
Danling.

185
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,410
Danling,

186
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,250
I didn't wanna

187
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,650
upset Lady Shu again,

188
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,380
but you just won't
stop defaming me.

189
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,740
That crosses the line!

190
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,050
I'm curious about this.

191
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,340
Why did you

192
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,650
go to garden
since it was dark

193
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,410
and the road was slippery.

194
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,530
I was a little drunk,

195
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,690
so I went out for some air.

196
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,370
What?

197
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:28,860
Do you think

198
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,740
I had no right
to go there?

199
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,140
I feel too embarrassed to

200
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,890
say what you have
in your mind.

201
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,740
You!

202
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,740
Let me tell you all.

203
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,940
Father,

204
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,020
a maid just told me

205
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,220
Qingqing fell into the water,

206
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,570
tricking me to check.

207
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,860
Unexpectedly,

208
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,100
I met Danling

209
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,460
right there.

210
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,500
She told me as she cried

211
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,380
that she's been resentful

212
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,260
after getting married.

213
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,340
I...

214
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,980
Then Jiangli was
conned to the spot.

215
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,290
She attempted to drive

216
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,460
- a wedge between me and Jiangli.
- I didn't.

217
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:01,770
Master Jingming,

218
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:02,930
Consort Jiangli,

219
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,650
you two actually

220
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,340
smeared me regardless of

221
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,340
your statuses.

222
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,650
You're so good

223
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,770
at distorting facts.

224
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,130
Jingming,

225
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,370
Jiangli,

226
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,570
you two echo so well.

227
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,500
What a fabulous show!

228
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,010
Master JIngxiu,

229
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,980
you think it fabulous?

230
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,770
Obviously,

231
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,690
you know nothing about

232
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,050
what happened that year.

233
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,410
That was a good show.

234
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,260
We both know

235
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,020
well about that event.

236
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,700
Back then,

237
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,460
you made everyone believe

238
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,500
I was the one
who drove

239
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,570
a wedge between
you and Master Jingming.

240
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,770
In fact, it was
your own choice.

241
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:50,300
(Five years ago)

242
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,220
Sorry, seems I come to
the wrong place.

243
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,980
Stop there.

244
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,690
It's the right place.

245
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,980
I asked you to come
in the name of Ming.

246
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,060
Why do you

247
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,140
want to see me?

248
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,460
Hey,

249
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,100
don't you know
who I am?

250
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,490
I know.

251
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:16,690
Miss Wang.

252
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,340
Good that you know it.

253
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,770
I asked you to come

254
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,500
since I want to see

255
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,100
the appearance of a girl

256
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,170
from a poor family.

257
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,810
You're out of the league

258
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,620
to marry Ming.

259
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,460
Grandma arranged
the marriage.

260
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,570
Jingming, why did you invite me here?

261
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,820
Master Jingxiu,

262
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,810
I should go.

263
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,170
Poor people

264
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,860
are really unpresentable.

265
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,530
Am I so scary?

266
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,380
Of course not, Xiu.

267
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,620
Jingming should be
expecting me here.

268
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,290
I was also expecting him.

269
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,810
But I only saw
Shen Jiangli

270
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,340
after I reached here.

271
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,170
- Well.
- Since the dishes are ready,

272
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,300
why don't we eat

273
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,890
as we wait for him?

274
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,810
Maybe Jingming is on the way.

275
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,950
Sure.

276
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:17,860
Take a seat, Xiu.

277
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,740
Jingxiu, have a refill.

278
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,580
Come on.

279
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,810
We're almost drunk.

280
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,260
How come Jingming
is not here yet?

281
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,860
Jingxiu,

282
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,410
may all

283
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,690
your wishes

284
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,260
come true.

285
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,290
Cheers.

286
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:41,260
Thank you, Danling.

287
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,060
Jingxiu,

288
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,140
are you drunk?

289
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,420
Jingxiu?

290
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,380
Danling.

291
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,370
Jingxiu,

292
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,700
Jingxiu?

293
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,060
Jingming,

294
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,260
Shen Jiangli is to blame.

295
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,810
She adores you.

296
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,500
She knows we're close

297
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,100
since we
grew up together.

298
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,170
That's why

299
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,980
she made me drunk

300
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,500
and took me
to Jingxiu's room.

301
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:26,730
She did this to

302
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,500
stir up trouble
between us.

303
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,020
Jingming,

304
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,220
say something.

305
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,380
Jingming.

306
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:38,730
Miss Shen,

307
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,100
my lady did that just to

308
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,740
make it happen for you
and Young Master.

309
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,220
If my lady can't
marry Master

310
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,740
because of your rumor,

311
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,410
you won't marry
Young Master.

312
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:49,730
But...

313
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,700
before

314
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,740
in order to marry Master,

315
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,860
- you put on a show at the price
- I didn't.

316
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,860
of your own reputation.

317
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,740
Shen Jiangli, shut up.

318
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,050
Time will tell

319
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,530
my love for Master.

320
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:07,650
I...

321
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,770
Shen Jiangli is to
blame for this.

322
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,170
Jingxiu is not
a frivolous man.

323
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,650
General Wang,
how do you think

324
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,170
we should work this out?

325
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,250
Your Highness,

326
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,050
I'm a general
and my daughter

327
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,170
was insulted.

328
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,410
The Shen House
should be blamed.

329
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,290
This matter concerns
my daughter's reputation.

330
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,220
Father, Mother,

331
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,500
I should also be blamed

332
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,620
although I was drugged.

333
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,340
I have been

334
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,220
keen on Danling.

335
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,570
If Dangling doesn't mind,

336
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,100
I'll marry her properly.

337
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,020
I'll be always
there for you

338
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,980
and I won't let you
be wronged.

339
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,370
Danling,

340
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,020
you and Jingxiu
are a good match.

341
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,020
If you nod your head,

342
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,570
you'll become
Junior Consort Danling.

343
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,890
I agree.

344
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,220
You said

345
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:19,980
you admire Master,

346
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,220
but your trick

347
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,650
labeled him

348
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,860
a reckless drunk.

349
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,740
Moreover, Father has

350
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,930
wronged Master
all these years.

351
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,930
You said time will tell.

352
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,620
Back then, I didn't
nail the lie

353
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,340
just in order to
protect your reputation.

354
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,820
However,

355
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,460
you blamed

356
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,140
all that on me

357
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,690
since I was

358
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,220
young and timid.

359
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,100
- Shen Jiangli.
- You said

360
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,810
you and Master

361
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,650
became physically involved
because I drugged you.

362
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,980
I had been wronged
for years.

363
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,340
Shen Jiangli,
shut up.

364
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,380
I took the blame

365
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,690
to keep the peace
at home.

366
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,500
Unexpectedly,
you wronged me

367
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,860
that I pushed you
into the water.

368
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,530
And you drove a wedge
between me and Jingming.

369
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:06,740
I never did that.

370
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,200
- If I took the blame today,
- Trust me.

371
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,070
- you'd just
- I never did that.

372
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,530
go even further.

373
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:16,570
Shen Jiangli,

374
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,500
you have no proof

375
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,690
and you didn't
witness it.

376
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,650
That's a load of crap.

377
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,810
You can't insult me

378
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,860
even you hold grudges
against me.

379
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,580
Jiangli,

380
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,770
you're now much more

381
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,810
sharp-tongued.

382
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,570
If you wanna
blame everything on me,

383
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,460
I can do nothing.

384
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,500
Truly.

385
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,770
Everyone knows

386
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,570
Jingxiu and Danling
love each other.

387
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,380
You just won't stop

388
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,650
picking on Danling

389
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:47,890
because of such a trifle.

390
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,090
You're so narrow-minded.

391
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,460
Jiangli, this matter

392
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,050
concerns the reputation
of my family.

393
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,500
You should stop
the nonsense,

394
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,050
if you don't have proof.

395
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,410
Shen Jiangli, just cut it out.

396
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,460
You didn't reflect
on your mistakes.

397
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,290
Jingming,

398
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,770
let me handle this
for you.

399
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,180
Divorce Shen Jiangli.

400
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,330
It doesn't make sense

401
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,770
that I divorce my wife

402
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,370
because of
the groundless rumor.

403
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,530
Since no one believes us,

404
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:18,650
we should leave here.

405
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,780
Hold on.

406
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,610
I won't let Jiangli

407
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:23,700
suffer in silence.

408
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,770
Mother,
I need to say something.

409
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,580
Qingqing.

410
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:36,890
Father,

411
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,130
my face got hurt

412
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,260
after I was pushed
out of the carriage.

413
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,180
It wasn't Jiangli
who did this.

414
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,700
It was Wang Danling.

415
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,100
What?

416
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,450
Qingqing,

417
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,660
have you been deceived
by Shen Jiangli?

418
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,460
You and I are
like sisters.

419
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,200
Why would I hurt you?

420
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,500
Stop pretending
at this point.

421
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,340
Qingqing,

422
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,580
Qingqing,

423
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:10,700
do you forget this?

424
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,020
After the accident,

425
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,610
I was there with you
every night.

426
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:15,770
When you were upset,

427
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,130
I kept your company,

428
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,020
I cheered you up

429
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,190
and I entertained you.

430
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,530
I even asked Father

431
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,460
to find good doctors
for you.

432
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,290
How would I hurt you?

433
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,370
Don't let Jiangli
deceive you.

434
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,610
That's why
I never suspected you.

435
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,740
I thought
Jiangli was the culprit.

436
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,980
It never occurred to me

437
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,810
the culprit was

438
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,090
my sister-like friend.

439
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,420
Qingqing,

440
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,020
are you sure about that?

441
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,220
Was she really
the culprit?

442
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,660
I didn't do that.

443
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,800
Qingqing, it wasn't me.

444
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,610
Of course you wouldn't
hurt Qingqing.

445
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,420
At the beginning,

446
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,530
your target was me.

447
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,570
Accidentally,

448
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,370
Qingqing was
in my carriage.

449
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,460
That's why
she got hurt.

450
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,180
No.

451
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,410
People,

452
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,220
Danling is very timid.

453
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,090
She feels sad

454
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,570
even if she crushes
an ant.

455
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
How would she do
such a thing?

456
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:20,900
Yeah.

457
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,420
We've been there
since she was young.

458
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,460
I know
she's a kind girl.

459
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:27,690
Qingqing,

460
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,980
there must be
some misunderstanding.

461
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,340
Qingqing,

462
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,290
I've explained
over and over again.

463
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,020
I really have nothing
to do with this.

464
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:41,740
I don't know

465
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,290
who the culprit was.

466
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,660
Under great protection,

467
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,420
you've never seen
evil people.

468
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,980
I don't blame you today

469
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,530
for you were incited.

470
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,460
Wang Danling,

471
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,420
I didn't know you are

472
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,050
such a sophist

473
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,130
and hypocritical guy.

474
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,260
I want you to make up

475
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,260
for the injustice
I suffered.

476
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,100
- You...
- Qingqing!

477
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,420
She's your
sister-in-law.

478
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,130
Danling...

479
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,130
Father, Mother,

480
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,770
you don't
trust me though,

481
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,770
you should
trust Mr. Song.

482
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,530
He was the witness.

483
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,260
Qingqing,

484
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,980
don't let Jiangli
deceive you.

485
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,330
Mr. Song

486
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,530
might have taken bribes

487
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,500
from Shen Jiangli.

488
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,260
- You!
- Shut up.

489
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,370
Danling,

490
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,500
Mr. Song is a leading
Confucian master.

491
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,530
You were once
his student.

492
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,180
How could you frame him?

493
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,180
Qingqing,

494
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,370
why didn't you
say it earlier?

495
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,260
Mother,

496
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,130
I didn't know the truth
until days ago.

497
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,500
Your birthday
was coming.

498
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,570
I didn't wanna upset you

499
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,940
so I've kept the truth
a secret.

500
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,610
Moreover,

501
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,370
it's been years.

502
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,610
I thought

503
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,980
Danling might
have reformed.

504
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,850
I wanted to let her off.

505
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,770
But I can't tolerate

506
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,420
what she did
just now.

507
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,370
General Wang,

508
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,020
do you think

509
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,740
it necessary to invite
Mr. Song

510
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,740
to prove the truth?

511
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,060
Fine.

512
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,290
Since you don't
believe me,

513
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,770
I'll clear my name
by suicide.

514
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,050
Danling.

515
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,180
Let me die.

516
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,090
Danling.

517
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,010
That's enough!

518
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,700
How silly you are!

519
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,770
- Dad.
- Alright, alright.

520
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,580
Danling.

521
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,570
We own our being
to our parents.

522
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,530
If not for yourself,

523
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,700
think of your father.

524
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,940
Do you want to leave him

525
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,370
in unbearable grief

526
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,050
and sick from grief?

527
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,740
Father,

528
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,530
the guy who pushed

529
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,660
Qingqing out
of the carriage

530
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,900
also told me
another thing.

531
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,130
Lu Jingming,

532
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,500
enough already.

533
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,820
In fact,

534
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,330
the one who attempted

535
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,660
to poison Mother

536
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,180
was also Wang Danling.

537
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,570
Mother loves lilies.

538
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,900
It's said

539
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,850
that lilies help us calm.

540
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,940
I should have these
sent to Mother.

541
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,130
Danling,

542
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,050
thank you for
keeping my company.

543
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,290
Somehow I've had
a foggy head

544
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,460
and lacked enegery

545
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,260
these days.

546
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,290
Fortunately, I have you.

547
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:25,460
You're a nice
and filial girl.

548
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:28,660
Your Highness, I'll tell His Highness

549
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,050
you won't attend tonight.

550
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,220
You can't.

551
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,500
I have to go tonight.

552
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,770
Come on.

553
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:36,610
Help me up to get changed.

554
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,660
It's my fault.

555
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:51,850
Mother,

556
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:52,980
do you feel better now?

557
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,460
I'm pruning the lilies

558
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,180
and will sent them
to you.

559
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,050
You're so caring.

560
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:03,330
It's early and you're
already pruning.

561
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,330
Young Master is at a war.

562
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,460
I'm just doing
what I should do.

563
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,020
Good girl.

564
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,740
You're so hardworking.

565
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,260
You must be tired.

566
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,610
It's my responsibility.

567
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:22,660
Responsibility?

568
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,020
You're upset
for I punished you

569
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,220
so you poisoned me

570
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,370
to kill me.

571
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:29,980
Mother.

572
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,500
- I...
- Since you wanna be filial,

573
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,850
go watch
the ancestral tomb

574
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,530
of the Lu House. Take her away.

575
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:35,610
- Yes.
- Mother.

576
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:36,450
I didn't,

577
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,850
I didn't poison you.

578
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:38,810
- Go.
- Mother.

579
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,570
- Go! Go.
- I...

580
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,610
She even shifted
the blame

581
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:42,700
to Jiangli

582
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,050
so that Jiangli had been

583
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,260
grounded for years.

584
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,220
I didn't...

585
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,610
It turns out like this.

586
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,350
Young Master,

587
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,460
you're just like
your wife.

588
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,530
General Wang,

589
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,090
this is not
a trifle matter.

590
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,420
My mother is involved.

591
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,130
Please mind your words.

592
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,300
Mother,

593
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,740
about that thing,

594
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,260
I have evidence.

595
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,260
Yunyi.

596
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,860
You Highness,

597
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,940
Tai loiters in the streets

598
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:22,930
and commits many crimes.

599
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,130
But he's well-aware

600
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,290
that he's just a pawn.

601
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,180
He was alert.

602
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,090
He incorrectly labeled
the Tingyu Pavilion.

603
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,020
Junior Consort Danling

604
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,500
carelessly left
the revision mark

605
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,260
on the map.

606
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,020
And here's the copybook

607
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,850
of Junior
Consort Danling.

608
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,420
Please compare,
Your Highness.

609
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,050
Good for you.

610
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,260
Good.

611
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:52,890
How evil you are!

612
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,570
You did tons of
evil deeds

613
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,370
to set up

614
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,660
Jingming
and his wife.

615
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,130
You even hurt Lady Shu

616
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,980
and Qingqing.

617
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,850
How come
you became so cruel?

618
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,130
Father.

619
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,060
Father,

620
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,020
I failed to discipline
my wife properly.

621
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,020
Please punish me.

622
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,900
Your Highness,

623
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,180
my education failed.

624
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,050
Please punish me.

625
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:32,370
Your Highness,

626
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,370
it was my responsibility.

627
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,760
I beg Your Highness to forgive my daughter

628
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,050
since all my family are virtuous people.

629
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,210
Father,

630
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,850
given that Danling

631
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,660
has been caring
for our family,

632
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,180
allow me to
discipline her.

633
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,420
Father, don't worry.

634
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,370
I'll impose
strict discipline.

635
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,130
What will you do?

636
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,860
Wang Danling,

637
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:52,370
starting today,

638
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,020
you'll be grounded
for reflection.

639
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,610
Without my permission,

640
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,090
you can't leave
the mansion.

641
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,260
It's birthday banquet.

642
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,260
You people ruined it.

643
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,850
Everyone, leave now.

644
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,900
Jingxiu...

645
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,260
Father...

646
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,330
Father,

647
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:28,980
Father.

648
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:30,930
Jingxiu,

649
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,940
don't leave me alone.

650
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,180
Father,

651
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,740
Father.

652
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,020
Wang Danling,

653
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,610
if you hadn't forced me,

654
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,130
I wouldn't have
gone so far.

655
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:45,770
You asked for this.

656
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,020
Shen Jiangli,

657
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,460
you're so evil.

658
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,130
If you keep

659
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,810
being stubborn,

660
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,440
I won't let you off.

661
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,290
Shen Jiangli,

662
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:06,020
as long as I am alive,

663
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,900
I'll make you pay

664
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,530
a hundredfold!

665
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:10,610
Good.

666
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,980
I'm waiting.

667
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,260
Let's go.

668
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,130
You were so
well-prepared.

669
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,660
You didn't tell me
about this.

670
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,900
I should have done this
5 years ago.

671
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,220
I'm sorry about

672
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,900
what happened
back then.

673
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,500
Thank you

674
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,860
so much today.

675
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,770
You're a good partner.

676
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,290
I admire you.

677
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,500
Just a partner?

678
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:04,850
What else do you think?

679
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,130
How come

680
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,570
you're still
so weighed down

681
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,260
after the truth
was revealed?

682
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,530
I'm not.

683
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,460
The truth came out today.

684
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:23,810
I'm certainly pleased.

685
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,820
Really?

686
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,940
Then tell me...

687
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:29,610
Look,

688
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:30,970
a meteor.

689
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,580
She Jiangli.

690
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,410
By the way,

691
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,260
Tai repeatedly does
the dirty work.

692
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,700
He's heinously wicked.

693
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:42,810
What are you gonna
do to him?

694
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,570
Send him to Dali Temple.

695
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,090
Someone will judge him.

696
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:47,970
That's it?

697
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,740
What else could we do?

698
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,020
I'm tired.

699
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,020
Young Master,
I won't bother you.

700
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:57,740
I should leave.

701
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,050
Be careful.

702
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:26,090
Shen Qilan.

703
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,540
Tai,

704
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,220
you exposed
Junior Consort Danling

705
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,420
so you should
be rewarded.

706
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:38,610
I just want

707
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,260
3 huts

708
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,610
and some land.

709
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,850
No problem.

710
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,330
Summon Matron Dong.

711
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,180
Yulan,

712
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,940
what can I do for you?

713
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,460
You deserve great credit

714
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,740
for arresting Tai.

715
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,570
Junior Consort Jiangli
is strict about

716
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,660
rewards and consequences.

717
00:30:58,890 --> 00:30:59,740
She said she'd

718
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,500
reward you properly.

719
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,660
That's not necessary.

720
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,290
A large quantity
of money

721
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,660
can't buy

722
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,460
my faithfulness for

723
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,740
Junior Consort Jiangli.

724
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,020
Matron Dong,

725
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,660
Junior Consort Jiangli
said

726
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,810
it's vulgar to
give you money.

727
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,450
Well,

728
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:20,370
eh,

729
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:21,460
it hurts my feeling

730
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,290
if the reward
isn't money.

731
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,020
Would you like Tai

732
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,460
as the reward?

733
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,180
Well, what do you mean, Yulan?

734
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,770
I don't get it.

735
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,660
Tai has a strong physique

736
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,330
but no wife.

737
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,770
He told me

738
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,420
he wants 3 huts

739
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,460
and some land.

740
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,220
I believe

741
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,700
you have these,
don't you?

742
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,130
Yes.

743
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,580
Let go of me.

744
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,850
Mother,

745
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,020
Mother, we're back.

746
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,420
- My lord,
- Father, slow down.

747
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,460
what happened?

748
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:02,900
You're so drunk.

749
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:04,410
Nothing serious.

750
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,290
I just got choked up.

751
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,260
Well, Mother,

752
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,100
I should go.

753
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,220
Okay.

754
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,770
My lord,

755
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,850
I felt something subtle

756
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:20,690
among your family

757
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:25,370
on Lady Shu's birthday,

758
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,420
especially Jingming
and Jingxiu.

759
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,530
Do they have
a bad relationship?

760
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,600
I don't know
what happened to them.

761
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,770
We were pretty close

762
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:33,850
when we were young.

763
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,050
My mother died early.

764
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:39,330
I was raised by Lady Shu.

765
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,770
Jingming

766
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,810
is quite a gentle man.

767
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,370
I've been closer
with him

768
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,740
but I respect
Jingxiu most.

769
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,770
I always think he has

770
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,460
the bearing
of the future prefect.

771
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,810
I don't know them well

772
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,530
but I can tell

773
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,130
from the banquet

774
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,810
that Jingming is
more like a prefect.

775
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:04,940
He's peaceful

776
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,780
and considerate.

777
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,940
I guess he concerns
about the world.

778
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,770
Let's see who will

779
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,740
be ascended to

780
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,370
the future prefect.

781
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,580
Qilan.

782
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,740
Mother.

783
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,940
Did you see Shen Jiangli?

784
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,130
Yes.

785
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,700
She's smart and handy.

786
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,020
Young Master loves her.

787
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,180
Don't worry about her.

788
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,980
She has nothing
to be worried about.

789
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,500
I'm worried
she will request

790
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,530
to split
the inheritance

791
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,220
since she has
Young Master

792
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,370
as her backup.

793
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,210
Mother,

794
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,980
what are you saying?

795
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,850
Jiangli is our family.

796
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:47,700
She's entitled to a share

797
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,050
of the inheritance.

798
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,380
I just want what's best
for you.

799
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,940
If you really do,

800
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,810
don't say anything
like that again.

801
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,850
You're hopeless.

802
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,570
What a waste of my care!

803
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,050
You're supposed
to take my side.

804
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:03,180
I wonder
what's in your mind.

805
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:05,220
Mother,

806
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,060
I'm sleepy.

807
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,580
You...

808
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,570
Mother,
good night.

809
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,580
(Sister for Qilan)

810
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:45,530
Yuzhu,

811
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,050
is Master home yet?

812
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:10,900
You go watch outside.

813
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,010
Yes.

814
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,340
(My lover Jingxiu, Qilan wrote.)

815
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,900
(Shen Qilan,)

816
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,210
(Shen Jiangli,)

817
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,780
(I won't let off)

818
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,570
(you mean sisters easily.)

819
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,090
Here comes Master.

820
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:40,860
Danling,

821
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,530
- today...
- Jingxiu,

822
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,610
don't trust any words

823
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,050
of Shen Jiangli.

824
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,500
She tried to drive

825
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,730
a wedge between us.

826
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,900
I've been deeply devoted

827
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:54,690
to you.

828
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:57,410
Good.

829
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:58,890
Master,

830
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:00,610
I did meet

831
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,650
Young Master today

832
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,360
but I just

833
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,820
wanted to dig up

834
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,970
dirt on him

835
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,050
to undermine
his credibility.

836
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,410
I...

837
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,210
I was not smart

838
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,210
and patient enough.

839
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,980
But I did that

840
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,570
just for the sake of you.

841
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:23,610
I believe you.

842
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:26,860
Thank you, Master.

843
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,450
Master,

844
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:32,610
this soup is for you.

845
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,380
You'd better have it while it's hot.

846
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,620
Sure.

847
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,530
You should leave.

848
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,140
Well,

849
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,300
Master,

850
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,730
get some rest early.

851
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,780
