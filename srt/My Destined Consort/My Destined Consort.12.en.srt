22
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,250
A branded criminal
can still hide the truth

23
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,220
and hold a high position.

24
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:46,940
It seems

25
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,060
the person behind him

26
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,710
is no ordinary figure.

27
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,180
How dare you.

28
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,300
What do you have to say
in your defense?

29
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,980
I know my crime.

30
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,160
Please spare me, My Lord.

31
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,530
You scoundrel!

32
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,970
How dare you deceive me
and disrupt state affairs!

33
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,420
Guards,

34
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,300
take him away.

35
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,700
He shall be beheaded someday.

36
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:07,570
My Lord!

37
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,020
Master Jingxiu!

38
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,380
Save me! Save me!

39
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:12,610
Master Jingxiu!

40
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,210
Master Jingxiu!

41
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,170
Scoundrel!

42
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,400
You slandered Jingming,

43
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,850
and now you want to slander me?

44
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,930
I have no idea

45
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,100
what he is talking about.

46
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,380
My Lord,

47
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,340
it was Master Jingxiu who instructed me.

48
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,300
He didn't want Master Jingming

49
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,380
to be in charge of Qilin Guards,

50
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:29,900
so he came up with this plan

51
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,520
and gave me
three thousand taels of gold.

52
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,450
But I haven't touched the money at all.

53
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,750
Father, please believe me.

54
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,860
I don't know what he's talking about.

55
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,020
This man must've

56
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,380
taken advantage of my desire

57
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,820
to help you

58
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,490
to make me fall into his trap.

59
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:44,820
Then,

60
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,820
he used this trap to frame Jingming.

61
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,210
Father,

62
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,730
I know nothing about it.

63
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,820
Take him away! Take him away!

64
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,170
Take him away!

65
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,290
My Lord!

66
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,100
My Lord!

67
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,820
The situation today

68
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,170
reminds me of a line

69
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,450
from the Book of Songs:

70
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,820
Quails and magpies

71
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,330
fly in pairs.

72
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,820
Why should I take

73
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,140
an unkind man as my brother?

74
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,330
Jingxiu,

75
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,330
you misjudged him.

76
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,610
Starting tomorrow,

77
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,750
no need to greet me or discuss things.

78
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,930
Go home and reflect in isolation.

79
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,450
Leave.

80
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,580
Yes.

81
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,540
I understand.

82
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,890
It should be this way.

83
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,210
Father, please don't be angry,

84
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,100
or you'll have a headache again.

85
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:45,860
Do you think

86
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,140
I'm getting old?

87
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,540
How could I be fooled
by such a lowly man for so long?

88
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,610
You're deeply loved by the people.

89
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,340
It's understandable to miss something
during your busy schedule.

90
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,020
This is also our fault

91
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,540
for not figuring it out earlier.

92
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,730
Jingming,

93
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,210
you did well this time,

94
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,700
showing some of my old style.

95
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,260
You've improved

96
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,650
from your work with Qilin Guards.

97
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,260
Jiangli,

98
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,780
you saw through Zhou Siqi's tricks.

99
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,600
With this kind of insight,

100
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,050
you've really impressed me.

101
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,020
Thank you for the praise.

102
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,140
This is what I should do.

103
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,920
A man should marry a virtuous wife.

104
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,930
Jingming's success today

105
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,260
is also thanks to your efforts.

106
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,840
It seems that my arrangement

107
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,740
for your marriage back then

108
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,450
was a wise decision.

109
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,580
No matter what happened before,

110
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,210
as a couple,

111
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,890
you must support each other.

112
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,880
Don't let me down.

113
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,850
I will remember your teachings.

114
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,370
Mr. Chu.

115
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,210
Thank you for your help this time.

116
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,740
My Lord, you're too kind.

117
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,940
I came

118
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,530
not only to expose the plot

119
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,750
but also to help the victims
of the disaster.

120
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,970
Natural disasters are an act of nature

121
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,050
and should not be blamed
on jinxes or sorcery.

122
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,290
This time,

123
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,090
after an investigation,

124
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,020
I already have a plan
to save the people.

125
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:12,790
Good.

126
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,620
If Mr. Chu is willing to stay,

127
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,650
it will be a blessing for our people.

128
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,410
Jingming,

129
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,060
you should learn more from Mr. Chu.

130
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,580
Yes.

131
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,900
Jingming,

132
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,480
Yao just opened this year's

133
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,620
new peach blossom wine
at Dongfang Tavern today.

134
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,770
Would you and Jiangli like to join us?

135
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,900
Next time.

136
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,140
Last time on the outing,

137
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,180
Yao was very happy to see Jiangli.

138
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,580
Let's drink and admire flowers

139
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,060
next time.

140
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,340
Sure.

141
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,700
What's wrong with Jingming?

142
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,410
He's more anxious than I am.

143
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,020
Thank you, Zimo.

144
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,280
There's no need for thanks between us.

145
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,290
This is also to protect
Mentor's reputation.

146
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,180
Once this disaster is over,

147
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,290
I'll take you back

148
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,180
to Wind Pavilion

149
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,850
to reunite with Yanyan and Mentor.

150
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,290
I miss Mentor too.

151
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,580
I wonder

152
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,290
if the dried fruits and pastries I left

153
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,450
have been finished.

154
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,740
Mentor must be worried

155
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,680
that I'll stay outside

156
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,160
and won't come back to cook for him.

157
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,620
Then when you go back,

158
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,140
you must cook something nice for him.

159
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,380
Zimo, earlier,

160
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,380
what was the secret

161
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,220
you drew?

162
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,060
A birthmark.

163
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,890
Zimo,

164
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,450
good for you.

165
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,770
You can even guess that?

166
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,140
Of course not.

167
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,740
I'm not that capable.

168
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,180
So, how did you know?

169
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,380
When I was with Mentor,

170
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,530
the former chief mentioned this.

171
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,780
What did he say?

172
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,450
He said that when the Prefect

173
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,140
was still the Young Prefect,

174
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,530
he found

175
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,940
a heart-shaped birthmark on his body.

176
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,180
He didn't like it at all,

177
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,440
so he came to Wind Pavilion

178
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,900
and asked if there was a way

179
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,820
to remove it.

180
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,650
Oh, I see.

181
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,850
I thought you could foresee
things like this.

182
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,700
I can foresee something,

183
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,260
but I don't know what it means.

184
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,490
By the way,

185
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,740
you're a distinguished guest.

186
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,020
We have prepared

187
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,260
a top-quality room for you.

188
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,890
You've traveled a long way,

189
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,500
so it's better you rest early.

190
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:11,980
Yunyi.

191
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,450
Please come with me.

192
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,380
Will you stay here?

193
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:16,930
Yes.

194
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,260
This way,

195
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,700
it will be more convenient

196
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,210
for you and the Prefect

197
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,650
to discuss disaster relief matters.

198
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,740
Alright, you can stay here.

199
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,060
It's close to Master Jingming's Mansion,

200
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,380
so you can come find me anytime.

201
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,050
Alright.

202
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,540
Jiangli,

203
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,700
do you have a lot of luggage?

204
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,490
No.

205
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,340
Good.

206
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,680
The disaster relief

207
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,060
won't take long.

208
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,140
Remember to pack early,

209
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,380
so you won't be

210
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,820
in a rush later.

211
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,690
Got it.

212
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,740
Your Grace, you're going out?

213
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,090
Jingming and Jiangli are safe today,

214
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,090
so I made these osmanthus cakes

215
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,500
to celebrate with them.

216
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,190
That's very thoughtful of you.

217
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,890
Has someone important
come to the mansion?

218
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,410
Who is it?

219
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:09,710
Miss, don't be afraid.

220
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:10,730
Let me take a look.

221
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,050
Don't look at me.

222
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,530
It's just a small scratch.

223
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,650
It's not deep.

224
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,050
Please come with me.

225
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,700
Come on.

226
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,100
Come on.

227
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,740
Miss, it's all good now.

228
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,010
Sorry.

229
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,250
I...

230
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,750
Sorry for losing my composure.

231
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,530
It's alright.

232
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,740
But in the future,

233
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,660
don't be so anxious
about your appearance.

234
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,870
There are the good and evil,

235
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,860
the pretty and ugly.

236
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,570
If you follow your heart,

237
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,420
your appearance will change accordingly.

238
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,680
My appearance reflects my heart.

239
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,340
I understand now.

240
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,610
Miss,

241
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:25,860
take this.

242
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,160
Remember to apply it every day.

243
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,370
Sir.

244
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,650
May I ask your name?

245
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,500
I'm Chu Zimo.

246
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,100
Chu Zimo.

247
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,860
By the way,

248
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,270
since I've used this handkerchief,

249
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,650
how about you give it to me?

250
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,530
Now that you've returned,

251
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,150
how long are you planning

252
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,340
to stay before leaving again?

253
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,500
What's the matter?

254
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,100
I'd like to meet Consort Jiangli.

255
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,500
My Lady.

256
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,220
(Master Jingming's Mansion)

257
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,060
My Lady.

258
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:31,980
You're...

259
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,020
Yunniang?

260
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,410
Yes.

261
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:37,740
Who's this?

262
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,570
This is my mother's maid.

263
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:40,770
Yunniang,

264
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,340
why are you here?

265
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,270
I remember you resigned
and returned home

266
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,650
after my mother passed away.

267
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,460
I didn't resign.

268
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,050
I was driven out of Shen Mansion.

269
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,750
- Back then...
- We can't talk outside.

270
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:51,980
Let's go in.

271
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:53,490
Let's go.

272
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,890
My Lady,

273
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,930
I've searched for you for so long.

274
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,690
You said you were driven out?

275
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,170
What happened?

276
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,340
I...

277
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,260
Well.

278
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,620
I'll go back to the kitchen.

279
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,660
You two can talk.

280
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,860
My Lady,

281
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,570
your mother didn't die of illness.

282
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,160
I tried every possible way to find you

283
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,740
just to tell you about this.

284
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,250
No need to kneel.

285
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,170
I don't dare to speak carelessly.

286
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,570
Your mother had always been healthy.

287
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,650
She rarely suffered
from headaches or fever,

288
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,220
but suddenly, without any signs,
she fell ill.

289
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,140
(Shen Jiangli's mother)

290
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,170
My Lady, it's windy.

291
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,500
Let's go back inside.

292
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,500
I don't want to go back in that room.

293
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,650
I just want to get
some fresh air outside.

294
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,260
My Lady, please drink the medicine.

295
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,130
My Lady.

296
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,170
My Lady, should I call the physician?

297
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:18,530
Where is Master?

298
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,930
Master hasn't returned yet.

299
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,530
Jiangli...

300
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,690
She's already asleep.

301
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,100
I'll call her now.

302
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,770
What worries me most

303
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:34,690
is Jiangli.

304
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:37,730
In the future,

305
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,740
you must take good care of her for me.

306
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,490
My Lady,

307
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,160
you've been kind to me.

308
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,860
I will take good care of Ms. Jiangli.

309
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,100
My Lady, you're blessed. You'll be fine.

310
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,060
My Lady.

311
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:56,730
My Lady.

312
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,290
Afterwards, no medicine

313
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,650
or ginseng ever worked.

314
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,050
Your mother eventually passed away.

315
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,930
The most suspicious thing is

316
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,140
that ants died in a circle
around her medicine.

317
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,820
Yunniang,

318
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,570
I was still young back then,

319
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,410
so I don't remember many things.

320
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,220
As you think this is suspicious,

321
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,460
do you have any suspects?

322
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,050
At that time,

323
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,140
Tian Xiaozhen and Zou Jiaoyue
were both favored.

324
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,840
Master often stayed in their chambers.

325
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,860
Your mother advised him to focus on work

326
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,770
and consider the family's future.

327
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,050
Master not only ignored her

328
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,650
but also scolded her,

329
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,340
calling her a jealous woman.

330
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,740
Your mother cried every day.

331
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,170
What a shameless man.

332
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,170
Then, for some reason,

333
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,570
she suddenly went mad

334
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:54,740
and often talked nonsense,

335
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,550
saying things we couldn't understand.

336
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,770
And you also became dazed.

337
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,270
Your reactions

338
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,020
slowed down a lot.

339
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,320
Ms. Tian said

340
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,690
maybe you were possessed
by an evil spirit.

341
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,620
Ms. Zou even invited a Taoist

342
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,050
to exorcise the spirit.

343
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,140
She didn't mean well.

344
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,860
The Taoist said the evil spirit
was dangerous

345
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,970
and couldn't be driven away,

346
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,220
and he also said

347
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,100
you'd endanger the entire family.

348
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:20,610
So, Master

349
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,650
grew even more distant from you two.

350
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,770
When your mother passed away,

351
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,020
Master didn't seem sad

352
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,340
but rather seemed relieved.

353
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,770
Ms. Zou and Ms. Tian

354
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,740
blamed the servants
for neglecting your mother

355
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,620
and expelled all the maids

356
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,140
who attended to her.

357
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,530
Do you have any evidence for this?

358
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,860
When I left the mansion,

359
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,260
I took your mother's medicine dregs

360
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,050
to see if there was anything unusual.

361
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,140
But other servants falsely accused me

362
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,410
of stealing valuable items,

363
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,050
beat me up,

364
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,500
and kicked me out.

365
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,490
Yunniang,

366
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,740
my mother's been gone for ten years.

367
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,170
Why are you only bringing this up now?

368
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,770
After I was expelled,

369
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:01,020
I tried every way to send news to you,

370
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,220
but no one

371
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,410
in Shen Mansion could be trusted.

372
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,060
I thought

373
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,530
you were still young back then,

374
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,530
so even if you knew the truth,

375
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:11,960
there was nothing you could do.

376
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,340
Besides,

377
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,020
your mother had no family to rely on,

378
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,980
and Master

379
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,170
didn't care much about you.

380
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,930
I thought I should wait

381
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,770
and tell you the whole truth

382
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,740
until you were married

383
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,050
and had someone to rely on.

384
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:26,890
But unexpectedly...

385
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,740
Fortunately, I heard recently
that you and Master Jingming

386
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,690
are very close,

387
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,050
so I hurried to tell you.

388
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:36,770
Yunniang,

389
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,690
you were with my mother

390
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,790
when she married my father,

391
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,440
so I naturally trust your loyalty
to my mother.

392
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,380
But there's no evidence

393
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,100
for this right now.

394
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,060
How about this?

395
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,650
You can stay here for now,

396
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,890
but you can't tell anyone about this.

397
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,340
Once I uncover the truth,

398
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,050
I will make those murderers

399
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,500
pay with their blood.

400
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,850
My Lady,

401
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,180
I've found out everything.

402
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,770
The Prefect has confined Master Jingxiu

403
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,900
because of the Director of Astrology.

404
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:18,650
Confined?

405
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,220
Yes.

406
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,020
I heard
that since Master Jingxiu returned,

407
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,220
he's been in a bad mood.

408
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:31,980
It seems

409
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,980
our chance has come.

410
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,050
What do you mean?

411
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,170
Yuzhu,

412
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:40,810
go inform Father and ask him

413
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,090
to fully assist me and Master Jingxiu.

414
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,900
If you want Master to assist you now,

415
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,530
will it benefit your maiden family?

416
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,770
Only after you marry Jingxiu

417
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,220
can you become

418
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,850
the most respected woman in Dongzhou

419
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,530
and the future mistress

420
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,460
of the Prefect's Mansion.

421
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,820
But

422
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,290
I have feelings for Jingming.

423
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,370
In my eyes,

424
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,530
my lineal daughter

425
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,800
should be the most respected woman

426
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,020
in Dongzhou.

427
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,660
Since I married Master Jingxiu,

428
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,980
my maiden family

429
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,770
has been closely allied
with Master Jingxiu.

430
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,860
Master Jingxiu is the lineal eldest son,

431
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,420
and his mother is Lady Wang.

432
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,810
So, how could we not rise again?

433
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,570
That most respected position

434
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,700
must be mine.

435
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,130
Why are you here?

436
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,080
You haven't eaten, right?

437
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,260
Did you prepare this for me?

438
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:52,900
Of course.

439
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,370
Master Jingming spent
the whole afternoon in the kitchen.

440
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:58,930
By the way...

441
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,780
(Rites and Astrology of Zhou)

442
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,590
The only copy
of Rites and Astrology of Zhou?

443
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,220
How did you find this book?

444
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,660
I got it from an old monk

445
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,570
who's been traveling.

446
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,130
You traded with your blood jade.

447
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,220
Why are you

448
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,530
giving me this book?

449
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,980
I heard from Yunniang

450
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,290
that your mother didn't die of illness.

451
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,980
This book contains
many mysterious methods.

452
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,420
I thought

453
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,730
maybe it could be useful to you.

454
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:31,770
I'll take my leave.

455
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,260
Master Jingming,

456
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,130
that day on the cliff,

457
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,090
you saved my life.

458
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,980
The grudges between us are now settled.

459
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,900
You don't need to feel guilty

460
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,940
about the past,

461
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,130
and you don't need to do this
to make up for it.

462
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,050
I'm not doing this
to make up for anything.

463
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,940
I just want to do this.

464
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:58,890
Jiangli.

465
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,740
Jiangli.

466
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,260
- Jiangli.
- Zimo.

467
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:05,890
Jiangli,

468
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,770
I've come up with a plan
to save the people.

469
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,450
I'll submit it to the Prefect tomorrow.

470
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,920
Then we can return to Wind Pavilion.

471
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,790
So soon?

472
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,900
It's been a long time since you left.

473
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,260
Mentor has been missing you.

474
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,220
Jiangli's mother's cause of death
hasn't been clarified.

475
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,410
Why not

476
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,970
look into it before you return?

477
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:31,650
Jiangli,

478
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,290
as a daughter,

479
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,330
you can't remain uninvolved

480
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,090
in such matters.

481
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,390
I'll help you investigate this,

482
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,730
and then we'll go back together.

483
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,500
Mr. Chu, how considerate of you.

484
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,130
You always think of my wife

485
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,530
in everything you do.

486
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,330
You haven't eaten, right?

487
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,460
Please eat; don't starve yourselves.

488
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,020
Zimo, have you eaten?

489
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,220
Would you like to join us?

490
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,650
I...

491
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,500
I asked the kitchen

492
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:00,850
to make this

493
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,330
for Jiangli.

494
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,300
It may not be enough.

495
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,330
How about this?

496
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,050
If Mr. Chu hasn't eaten yet,

497
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,050
I'll have the kitchen
make another serving

498
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,190
and send it to your chamber.

499
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,170
What do you think?

500
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,860
That's fine.

501
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:16,930
Please.

502
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,080
Master Jingming, forgive me.

503
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,240
Five years ago,
Jiangli was seriously ill,

504
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,770
and I treated her day and night,

505
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,330
so naturally, we became closer.

506
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,130
It just so happens

507
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,850
that I've been suffering
from a chronic illness,

508
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,580
and Jiangli

509
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,330
has been caring for me without rest.

510
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,090
Our bond

511
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,570
is self-evident.

512
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,900
It seems that the words

513
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,770
I said at the ancestral tomb that day

514
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,660
were all in vain.

515
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,560
That day at the ancestral tomb,

516
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,290
your words weren't in vain.

517
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,460
I sincerely

518
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,660
thank you

519
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,700
for waking me up.

520
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,560
It was because of that moment

521
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,180
that I decided

522
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:18,810
to do my best

523
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,090
to win back the love in my heart.

524
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:23,610
If

525
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,050
Jiangli still wants to leave in the end,

526
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,460
I won't stop her.

527
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,820
But if

528
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,940
Jiangli doesn't want to leave,

529
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,610
no one can take her away,

530
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,410
not even

531
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,850
you.

532
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,820
Then

533
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,420
we'll see if you

534
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,460
have the ability

535
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:48,410
to stop me

536
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,020
from taking her away.

537
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,300
Young Master.

538
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,910
What are you doing here?

539
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,420
I heard that you've been
sleeping poorly,

540
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,950
so I've prepared calming soup for you.

541
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,260
Please drink it while it's hot.

542
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,450
Put it here.

543
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,530
I know what's troubling you.

544
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,940
What's troubling me?

545
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,390
You must be concerned
about the disaster relief.

546
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,610
As your wife,

547
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:37,940
I'll be by your side.

548
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,940
My father will also assist you.

549
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,290
General Wang will assist me?

550
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:53,450
Of course.

551
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,020
I'm my father's only daughter,

552
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,420
so my family

553
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,610
will surely support you.

554
00:23:59,050 --> 00:23:59,900
A few days ago,

555
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,420
my father even sent a word,

556
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,900
hoping I could relieve your worries.

557
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,660
What does the General think?

558
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,460
I heard that many people in the city

559
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,740
have been displaced
due to the earthquake

560
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,060
and are struggling without food.

561
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,770
Though I can't leave the mansion,

562
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,220
I can have my father buy food,

563
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,290
which can help the people.

564
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,980
Besides, if the Prefect knows about it,

565
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,530
he'll know your good intentions.

566
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,980
Danling,

567
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,850
how thoughtful of you.

568
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,980
It's my fault for neglecting you

569
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,180
these days.

570
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,770
I'll make it up to you in the future.

571
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,850
Take good care of Consort Danling.

572
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,370
Yes.

573
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:47,870
Thank you, Young Master.

574
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,260
Then I'll go prepare it.

575
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,100
Alright.

576
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:06,980
What does that woman

577
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,220
have to fight with me?

578
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,060
Yuzhu,

579
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,700
go tell my father.

580
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,400
- Over there.
- Okay.

581
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,220
- Slow down.
- Be careful.

582
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,540
(Xizhou, Nanzhou)

583
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:50,860
Father.

584
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,570
How's it going?

585
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:55,940
At present,

586
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,090
I've made some inquiries.

587
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,600
In the entire Dongzhou,

588
00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:59,690
this place

589
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:00,410
and this one

590
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:02,340
are the most severely affected
by the disaster.

591
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:05,220
(Map of Dongzhou)
I've sent people to set up

592
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,040
temporary shelters at the marked spots,

593
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,820
which can accommodate
the people for now.

594
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,260
The biggest problem now

595
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,810
is the lack of manpower.

596
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,160
I've sent all Qilin Guards

597
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,620
to help with the disaster relief.

598
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,860
Father,

599
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,530
Jingming, you don't need to worry.

600
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,850
How did your face get like that?

601
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,940
When I was saving people,
there was dust everywhere.

602
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,020
It's unavoidable. It's fine.

603
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,450
By the way, Jingming,

604
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,190
you don't need to worry about manpower.

605
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,090
The people we rescued recently

606
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,900
are willing to help us build houses.

607
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,080
Right now,

608
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,530
everyone is working hard outside.

609
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,740
That's great.

610
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,740
Great.

611
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,660
So, Mr. Chu,

612
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,280
what do you think we should do next?

613
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,700
My Lord, in that case,

614
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,220
Master Jingming

615
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,460
could send more people

616
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:48,810
to assist with the relocation

617
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,320
and rebuilding of the people's homes.

618
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,880
Also, after a great disaster,

619
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,230
there is bound to be an epidemic.

620
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,390
I can prepare some medicines
from Wind Pavilion

621
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,520
to distribute to the people

622
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,040
to prevent the secondary harm
caused by the epidemic.

623
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:00,930
Good.

624
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,290
Mr. Chu, you've lived up to your name.

625
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:05,790
You flatter me, My Lord.

626
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,900
The position of Director of Astrology

627
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,570
has been vacant for a long time.

628
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,460
Mr. Chu, since you're here now,

629
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,500
can you take up this post?

630
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,020
I'm afraid I can't be
the Director of Astrology.

631
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,220
My Lord, if you don't have
a candidate now,

632
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,530
I can temporarily handle this

633
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,420
before my return.

634
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,500
Good.

635
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:28,450
Master Jingming,

636
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,050
please

637
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,500
give me a badge,

638
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,460
allowing me to move freely
in your mansion.

639
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,530
That way,

640
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,700
we can often meet

641
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,600
and discuss matters.

642
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,290
It seems Mr. Chu and Jingming

643
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,090
are like-minded confidants now.

644
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,460
Jingming,

645
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,570
don't let Mr. Chu's goodwill
go to waste.

646
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:47,460
Father, rest assured.

647
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:48,650
I won't let him down.

648
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,220
Has Mr. Chu come back?

649
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,850
Your Grace,

650
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:20,180
Mr. Chu usually spends his days

651
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,330
out with Master Jingming
helping with disaster relief.

652
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,060
In the evening,

653
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,630
he returns to Master Jingming's Mansion

654
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,150
to discuss state affairs with him.

655
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,980
He usually comes back late at night.

656
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,050
Alright.

657
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,850
The Prefect is returning soon

658
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,090
and will be passing by.

659
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,420
Do you know what to do?

660
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,540
Yes.

661
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,770
Once it's done, you'll be rewarded.

662
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,540
Okay.

663
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,860
Let's go.

664
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:49,770
- They're here.
- Let's go.

665
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:56,290
Master Jingxiu
and Consort Danling are kind,

666
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,850
sending us food every day.

667
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,370
- Or we'd be dead by now.
- Yes.

668
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,420
I heard Consort Danling
was in a difficult position

669
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,220
yet still thought of us common folk.

670
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,050
She truly is a living Bodhisattva.

671
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,090
Yes, yes.

672
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,970
- A living Bodhisattva.
- A living Bodhisattva.

673
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:09,920
What a kind woman!

674
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,970
Consort Danling is so kind.

675
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,080
Let's go to Jingxiu's place.

676
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,780
She's so kind!

677
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,370
We're deeply grateful!

678
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:23,610
My Lady,

679
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:24,710
the Prefect has arrived.

680
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:25,710
He's in the main hall.

681
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,300
Greetings,

682
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,900
My Lord.

683
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,130
No need for formalities.

684
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:44,190
I heard you've been
distributing congee to the people.

685
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,810
How are you?

686
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,020
Are you feeling unwell?

687
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,130
No.

688
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:53,940
Thank you for your concern.

689
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,130
My Lady, these days you...

690
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:56,970
Yuzhu,

691
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,180
be quiet.

692
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:00,180
What do you want to say?

693
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:02,970
My Lord,

694
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,330
the consort has been

695
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,940
staying in the mansion these days,

696
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,610
reflecting on her actions,

697
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,850
but upon hearing from the maids

698
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,180
that many people in the city
are homeless,

699
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,320
she's been reciting scriptures
and praying

700
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,460
day and night for the people

701
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,090
without good sleep for days.

702
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:17,940
Yuzhu,

703
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:20,290
don't offend the Prefect.

704
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,260
It's fine.

705
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,810
Tell me what you want to say.

706
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,090
Yes, My Lord.

707
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,850
The consort instructed me
to keep silent,

708
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,290
but if this continues,

709
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,900
her health will collapse.

710
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,610
I'm really worried about her,

711
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,530
so I has to speak out.

712
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,850
The people have suffered
from the earthquake

713
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,220
with no homes

714
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,220
and no food.

715
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,740
Jingxiu couldn't sleep over this.

716
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:42,530
I am

717
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:43,390
just doing some

718
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,810
insignificant little things.

719
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,130
Father, don't listen
to this girl's nonsense.

720
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,300
The physician said

721
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,330
that I just needed some rest.

722
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,470
My Lady, stop hiding this
from the Prefect.

723
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,660
The physician said

724
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,090
that if you continue,

725
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,370
it'll be hard for your blood
and qi to recuperate.

726
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,020
My Lord,

727
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,610
the consort has sold

728
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,800
all the jewelry
she could to raise funds.

729
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,660
It's truly embarrassing.

730
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,090
There's very little money left.

731
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,940
As long as it can help
with disaster relief

732
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,900
and lighten the burden
on Father and Jingxiu,

733
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,260
I'll be content.

734
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,130
Good child.

735
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:21,940
For the people's welfare,

736
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,850
you've even sold your dowry.

737
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,870
You've done very well this time.

738
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,220
It must be hard for you.

739
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,260
Jingxiu

740
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,940
also wants to help with disaster relief,

741
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,810
but because of his confinement,

742
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,330
there are few things he can do.

743
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,330
I was immature in the past

744
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,810
and made some mistakes,

745
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,260
so I've been trying to make up for them.

746
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,940
Now that he's entrusted this to me,

747
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,530
I can't fail

748
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,330
his deep love for the people.

749
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,770
You and Jingxiu have worked hard.

750
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,460
From today on,

751
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,050
the confinement will be lifted.

752
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:58,960
Let Jingxiu join you

753
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,390
in distributing congee to the people.

754
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:02,420
This will also give Jingxiu a chance

755
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,810
to make up for his past mistakes.

756
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,210
Yes.

757
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,180
My Lord, thank you on behalf of Jingxiu.

758
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:18,410
Be careful, Jiangli.

759
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,660
My Lady.

760
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,500
You're busy, right?

761
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,130
Let me do it.

762
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,500
Let me help.

763
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,500
Let me help.

764
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,090
Have you heard?

765
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,020
Consort Danling

766
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,090
sent her maid

767
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,260
to the city

768
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,660
to make a big fuss
about distributing congee.

769
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,660
It just so happened
that the Prefect saw her.

770
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,640
The Prefect

771
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,220
immediately lifted her confinement.

772
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,340
Can you believe it?

773
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,420
All the bad things she did before

774
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,740
are just forgotten now.

775
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,050
My Lady, come on.

776
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,360
It's not that I'm criticizing you,

777
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,610
but you should learn
from Consort Danling.

778
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:58,220
Look at you.

779
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,330
You always do things in the mansion.

780
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,220
Even if you do something extraordinary,

781
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,020
no one will know.

782
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,000
Do you think the Prefect doesn't know

783
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,710
their intentions?

784
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,230
I think the Prefect must believe

785
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,170
that as long as it's for the good
of the people,

786
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,150
their little selfishness

787
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,530
is acceptable.

788
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,090
Whether it's done secretly

789
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,660
or publicly,

790
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,050
we should just do the right thing.

791
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,850
My Lady, you're right.

792
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,670
We should just do the right thing.

793
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:30,370
How's it going?

794
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,290
You're just in time.

795
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,820
Here.

796
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,660
After this great disaster,

797
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,700
there will be an epidemic.

798
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,570
I've prepared some prescriptions.

799
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:40,810
Have them prepared

800
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,010
and distributed to the victims.

801
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,460
And these medicine pouches.

802
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:48,500
Take them.

803
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,810
Let the soldiers carry them

804
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:50,660
to prevent disease.

805
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,020
Zimo,

806
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,570
this is the medicine pouch I prepared.

807
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:57,570
You should carry it too.

808
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:04,450
What?

809
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,700
Do I not need it?

810
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,020
There's none left.

811
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:09,500
It's okay.

812
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,810
I'll make one for you right away.

813
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,500
Danling, what a good daughter-in-law

814
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,860
and a wise wife you are.

815
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,900
Jingxiu is no longer confined.

816
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,690
Danling, you did well.

817
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,090
This is what I should do.

818
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,530
In the future, remember your place.

819
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:51,860
Don't do anything beneath your dignity.

820
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,570
If you do,

821
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,020
no one will be able to save you.

822
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,090
Do you understand?

823
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:56,930
Yes.

824
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,170
I'll remember your teachings.

825
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:04,500
Jingming is now in high spirits.

826
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,500
Even his mother

827
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,980
is becoming arrogant
in the Prefect's Mansion.

828
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,170
Jingxiu and I

829
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,650
are struggling.

830
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,340
A full moon must wane.

831
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:19,980
A peak leads to a decline.

832
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:22,690
It's still possible to suppress

833
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,050
Master Jingming's momentum.

834
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,650
What's your plan?

835
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,940
I think the best way

836
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,500
is to set fire to his backyard.

837
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,090
What do you mean by that?

838
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,710
My Lady,

839
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,210
it's truly an honor to our family

840
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,170
that you came to offer incense
to the late Mrs. Shen.

841
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,930
The late Mrs. Shen
once helped the Prefect.

842
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,020
I've always wanted
to pay respects to her

843
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,200
but only found time today.

844
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,680
Yes.

845
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,380
If it weren't for their past,

846
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,340
Jiangli wouldn't have had the fortune

847
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,090
to marry Master Jingming.

848
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,050
I remember

849
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:26,650
there's still an unmarried young lady
in your family

850
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,180
called

851
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,180
Qilan, right?

852
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:30,370
Exactly.

853
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,570
How about

854
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,530
I find her a husband?

855
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,130
Qilan is perfect in every way,

856
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:39,890
but

857
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,780
she's the daughter of me, a concubine.

858
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,340
It's hard for her
to find a suitable match.

859
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,420
If Qilan

860
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:50,570
is lucky enough to have you
to be the matchmaker,

861
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,730
it would be a blessing for us.

862
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,650
Let me think.

863
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,940
Which young man

864
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,730
could be worthy of Qilan?

865
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,530
In terms of status and talent...

866
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,690
What do you think of Jingming?

867
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,840
Master Jingming?

868
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:12,860
Qilan

869
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:15,210
could never catch Master Jingming's eye.

870
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:16,860
Besides,

871
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,610
Consort Jiangli and Qilan...

872
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,780
This...

873
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,620
As you just said,

874
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,170
Jiangli married Jingming

875
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:27,040
only because of the late Mrs. Shen's
good deeds.

876
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,170
Qilan is beautiful and talented,

877
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:31,210
gentle and refined.

878
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,500
Perhaps

879
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,380
she might win Jingming's favor

880
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,780
more than Jiangli.

881
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,460
Moreover,

882
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,940
Jiangli is the consort

883
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,460
and her sister.

884
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,780
She'd never treat Qilan harshly.

885
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,690
It's good,

886
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,720
but...

887
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,750
Ms. Zou, no need
to beat around the bush.

888
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:57,300
Lady Wang,

889
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,380
why do you want

890
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,460
both of our young ladies

891
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,820
to share

892
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,570
a husband?

893
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,280
As you know,

894
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,340
Danling and Jiangli

895
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,960
have some misunderstandings
between them.

896
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,570
Now, it's causing some friction

897
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,770
between Jingxiu and Jingming.

898
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,780
It's because of the spiteful

899
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,170
who's been spreading rumors.

900
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:20,900
If Qilan

901
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,690
could marry Jingming

902
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,340
and mediate between them,

903
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,050
then my matchmaking efforts

904
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:27,300
wouldn't be in vain.

905
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,820
Greetings, Deputy Wu.

906
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,620
I was just about to look for you.

907
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,340
This is the fragrance for this month.

908
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,420
Master Jingxiu knows

909
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,340
that Consort Danling
has been working hard,

910
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,220
so he had someone

911
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,220
add ingredients

912
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,900
that can calm the mind and aid sleep.

913
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,140
He hopes it will be helpful.

914
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,740
This is Master Jingxiu's kind gesture.

915
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,500
Thank you, Deputy Wu.

916
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,980
Allow me to thank Master Jingxiu

917
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,140
on behalf of Consort Danling.

918
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,180
Jiangli has married Jingming

919
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,180
for five years

920
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,520
but hasn't given birth to a child.

921
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,420
If Qilan

922
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,380
can bear a child soon,

923
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,340
I will persuade the Prefect

924
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,980
to make her Jingming's wife.

925
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,500
At that time,

926
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,980
your position in the Shen family...

927
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,820
That'll be great.

928
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,100
Thank you, Lady Wang.

929
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,460
Qilan and I will repay you

930
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,940
for your great kindness

931
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,180
in the future.

932
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,500
Don't talk like that.

933
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,300
It's not about that.

934
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,380
I just hope the Prefect

935
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,900
can have a grandson soon.

936
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,340
You're so kind to Qilan.

937
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,620
It's Qilan's fortune.

938
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:40,900
I'm more than willing

939
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,660
for this to happen.

940
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,020
Tonight,

941
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,860
I will go to tell Master about this.

942
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,740
You're smart.

943
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,100
