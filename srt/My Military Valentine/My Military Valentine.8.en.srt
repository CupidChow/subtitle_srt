1
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:12,133
Pyeonghwasi has become

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,433
very special to me now.

3
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,833
I can't do it as I was trained.

4
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:01,500
Why don't you follow
the training, Major General?

5
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,233
Why were you running to me?
What if you got yourself killed?

6
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:22,833
Stay right here.

7
00:02:24,267 --> 00:02:26,433
Please exit this way.

8
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:53,233
Get on.

9
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:27,400
Mom, are you okay? I'm okay too.

10
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,867
Lloyd, where are you going?

11
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:31,933
Lloyd! Lloyd!

12
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:02,000
You didn't trust me at the end.

13
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:04,500
I just followed my belief.

14
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,667
Don't say such thing.

15
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:09,400
If you risk your life over small matters,
you'll end up ruining big things.

16
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,900
Just kill me.

17
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,733
I'd rather get killed by you.

18
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:19,367
Don't move.

19
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,500
Go.

20
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,567
Jae Hoon.

21
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:39,700
I said, go, you punk!

22
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,433
Please.

23
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:51,700
Let Seung Tae go.

24
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,500
You should at least wear shoes.

25
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:34,100
I mean,

26
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,367
does this make sense?

27
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:37,500
What was Unified Armed Force Unit doing?

28
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,800
Our comrades are so skilled,
almost like ghosts.

29
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,267
He just admitted they are his comrades.

30
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:44,800
Yes.

31
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,267
They are former members of anti-ROK operations.

32
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:48,667
See? I knew it.

33
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:49,700
Vice Commissioner Park, you…

34
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,167
We must cut off the funding
provided by the South first.

35
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:54,767
I'll take care of that soon--

36
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:56,467
And

37
00:05:56,467 --> 00:05:58,500
we have to capture the leader called "Shadow".

38
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,733
Guilty.

39
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:02,667
Once we catch the head, it's game over.

40
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:05,133
From Pyeonghwasi's perspective,

41
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:08,933
we must solve it before the North-South
Free Passage Agreement Ceremony.

42
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:10,167
You two.

43
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:11,800
Control all the media.

44
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,200
No one should know about yesterday.

45
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:37,667
What are you doing?

46
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:40,067
It's none of your business, Comrade Baek.

47
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:44,600
He's going to stand trial as a DPRK citizen.

48
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,367
Don't you know that

49
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:49,533
violence during interrogation is
illegal and will disgrace the DPRK?

50
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:56,733
Are you trying to teach me?

51
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:59,600
Does Vice Commissioner Park know this as well?

52
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,667
Illegal actions cannot be tolerated.

53
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:06,533
Keep the CCTV on at all times.

54
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,933
Are you okay?

55
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:37,933
Are you alright?

56
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:40,267
You looked pretty injured.

57
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:42,033
I'm okay.

58
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:44,167
The car seat was covered in blood.

59
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:45,467
I was really worried.

60
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:46,567
I'm sorry.

61
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:47,700
I'll pay for the car wash.

62
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,167
A car wash?

63
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:54,433
You should get me a new car.

64
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,933
Sure, I'll replace your car.

65
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:01,000
Forget it.

66
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,100
What's up with Song I?

67
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,533
What do you mean?

68
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:07,367
The kid has been through a lot.

69
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:09,200
It seems like she was
drafted into the hacker unit

70
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,833
after living alone without
parents during childhood.

71
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:11,900
- Hacker unit?
- Yeah.

72
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,367
She was quite an ace.

73
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:17,367
North Korean even sent her to study in Russia.

74
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:21,133
It seems that she became Violet to survive

75
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:24,233
during her time in Russia.

76
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:27,000
She might know or possess

77
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,833
some important information.

78
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,733
But to put the child through such a thing?

79
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:32,667
There's one more thing.

80
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:35,667
What is it? Tell me now.

81
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:38,933
You must have been quite important to her.

82
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:42,467
Otherwise, why would she
risk her life to report it?

83
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:58,400
Everything you said

84
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:01,967
was a lie?

85
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:05,967
It's nothing compared to
the Republic's betrayal.

86
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:08,833
Do you know how many comrades sent to the South

87
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,733
have been eliminated?

88
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:16,000
Republic warriors suddenly
became obstacles to unification,

89
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:21,067
and their reward for loyalty was death.

90
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:28,467
But…

91
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:32,567
I still…

92
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:53,000
Come in.

93
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:56,567
Unification.

94
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,800
How's your brother?

95
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,300
He's fine, thanks.

96
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:18,333
I did you the favor of keeping
your brother by your side.

97
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,267
To bring you here

98
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,867
is because I have high expectations of you.

99
00:10:26,867 --> 00:10:29,633
Yes, I'm aware of it.

100
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:37,333
The higher the expectation,
the greater the disappointment.

101
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:41,233
I'm warning you. If you disappoint me again,

102
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:43,733
I might be left with no choice.

103
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:45,700
Understand?

104
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,500
Understood, Comrade Vice Commissioner.

105
00:10:58,067 --> 00:11:00,667
Is there anything to report to me?

106
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,433
No.

107
00:11:03,433 --> 00:11:05,600
There isn't.

108
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:26,500
Are you going out?

109
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:30,667
You look unwell.

110
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:34,367
You're the one who got injured, Comrade No.

111
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Are you okay?

112
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,633
Are you worried about me now?

113
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:42,567
Why would I worry about you?

114
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:45,700
You look like you're struggling alone.

115
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:53,700
It's something I have to overcome by myself.

116
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,800
It's always been that way.

117
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,833
We're closed.

118
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,967
It's me.

119
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,733
Oh, you are here.

120
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:17,733
How are you?

121
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:20,633
I'm fine.

122
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:22,200
Are you sick?

123
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,133
You don't look so good.

124
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:27,200
I came to see Mi Rae.

125
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,467
Is she asleep?

126
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:31,067
She's too old to be sleeping this early.

127
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:32,733
Get in.

128
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:34,733
Okay.

129
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:43,933
He is Avon.

130
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:46,467
He has the fiercest look.

131
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:49,400
And these are Kane, Maki, and Aron.

132
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,400
How do you know so well?

133
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,200
They all look the same to me.

134
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,633
Never say that to anyone.

135
00:12:55,633 --> 00:12:57,967
It's embarrassing.

136
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,400
He's the leader, Lloyd.

137
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,867
He's quite genuine about music

138
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:04,833
and makes good songs too.

139
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,700
But he's not my type.

140
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,167
He's more your type.

141
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:12,100
What is my type?

142
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,733
How should I put it? It's a bit shabby.

143
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:17,767
What did you say?

144
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,867
What is it? Do you feel pain?

145
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:25,467
A little bit.

146
00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:27,233
Did you take the medicine?

147
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:29,633
Yes, don't worry.

148
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:32,267
How can I not worry?

149
00:13:32,267 --> 00:13:34,400
Stop watching this kind of stuff

150
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,500
and go to bed early.

151
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:46,967
I'm not worried at all

152
00:13:46,967 --> 00:13:52,100
because you promised to cure my pain.

153
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,800
Indeed.

154
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,267
Also, last time,

155
00:13:57,267 --> 00:14:02,100
you kept your promise to come and get me.

156
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,167
You even found me

157
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:08,567
when I escaped the orphanage
and begged at the market.

158
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,233
I can find you

159
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:16,067
wherever you are.

160
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:18,167
For sure.

161
00:14:20,733 --> 00:14:23,833
Go to sleep early. You have school tomorrow.

162
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:29,667
Song I, the phone call…

163
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:37,633
It can't go on any longer.

164
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:38,867
Please stop now.

165
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:41,267
You didn't report to Vice Commissioner Park.

166
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:47,800
Pyeonghwasi? Unified Armed Force Unit?

167
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,067
Do you think this petty show
will change the world?

168
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,133
They are all crazy.

169
00:16:57,167 --> 00:17:00,267
Think about all the effort we've put in.

170
00:17:00,267 --> 00:17:02,900
That doesn't justify what you did.

171
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,300
Unification is just a romanticist's fantasy.

172
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,367
We only just found out

173
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:08,733
there are many opponents to unification
in both the North and South.

174
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:10,733
People like us

175
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:16,400
only gain value and reason to live
when we're in a hostile relationship.

176
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,433
Don't try to persuade me.

177
00:17:19,433 --> 00:17:21,900
I don't think that way.

178
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:29,200
Think about Mi Rae.

179
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,267
And think about us.

180
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,900
I have money and power.

181
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,533
Let's send her to the US for surgery.

182
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:44,267
I refuse.

183
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:49,267
If I were to betray for such a reason,

184
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:52,933
I wouldn't have survived those harsh times.

185
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:55,967
Sacrificing myself for the Republic

186
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,600
and seeking forgiveness
for my father's unjust story

187
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,367
is the reason I live.

188
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,767
How much longer do you
think Mi Rae can hold on?

189
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:35,733
How pretty.

190
00:19:38,067 --> 00:19:40,567
You look so pretty today.

191
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,067
Do you want to die?

192
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:04,600
Gosh, I'm sorry.

193
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,267
Overslept? Have you lost your mind?

194
00:20:07,267 --> 00:20:09,267
Get up now.

195
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,767
What is this ridiculous dream?

196
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:21,367
Comrade Lee…

197
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:23,867
Surely he didn't come and leave, did he?

198
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,167
How come it's more vivid
than a dream about getting shot?

199
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:38,033
Well, I can eat, after all.

200
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:39,033
Enjoy your meal.

201
00:20:39,033 --> 00:20:40,867
Enjoy.

202
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:44,267
A man needs to eat well
to stay strong and fight hard.

203
00:20:44,267 --> 00:20:47,267
But why is it always half-and-half brown rice?

204
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:48,767
It's not like we are on an Arduous March.

205
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,767
It's for health.

206
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:55,667
Don't just gobble rice. Eat meat too.

207
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:57,867
Why are you giving me
something with your saliva on it?

208
00:20:57,867 --> 00:20:59,367
I can just go get more.

209
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:01,267
What's your problem?

210
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:03,967
Stop guys, stop!

211
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,833
Aren't you tired?

212
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,367
You guys full of energy?

213
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:12,833
That's why Unification isn't happening.

214
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,200
[Name, Date of Birth, Email]

215
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:33,433
Come in.

216
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:37,500
Did you lose some weight?

217
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,600
You look healthy.

218
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,833
Have you been doing okay?

219
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,900
Why did you call me?

220
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:47,633
Here's your overnight pass.

221
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:49,500
You know the Pyeonghwa hotel, right?

222
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,567
I heard your parents are coming tonight,

223
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:53,133
so I prepared it.

224
00:21:53,133 --> 00:21:55,333
It's okay.

225
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,400
Are you not on good terms with your parents?

226
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,733
You're not picking up or calling back,
so they're contacting me now.

227
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:01,533
It's not like that.

228
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:04,133
I just want to focus on my military life.

229
00:22:04,133 --> 00:22:05,233
Just go.

230
00:22:05,233 --> 00:22:07,067
Mr. Ban, he's good at golf, isn't he?

231
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:08,100
Oh, him.

232
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,000
He hits the ball well
and is a good drinker too.

233
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,800
He has a bit of a habit when drunk…

234
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,500
Please let me meet Song I.

235
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,267
It's hard to reach her because
of security clearance issues.

236
00:22:20,267 --> 00:22:21,900
But why her?

237
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,367
Don't you know?

238
00:22:23,367 --> 00:22:25,767
She saved my life.

239
00:22:32,867 --> 00:22:34,500
Sure.

240
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,167
We're the kind who do favors for each other.

241
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:24,033
You put me in a tough spot.

242
00:23:26,633 --> 00:23:29,600
Can't you help me now?

243
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,033
Traitor.

244
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:34,233
I'm the one who risked
my life for the Republic.

245
00:23:34,233 --> 00:23:36,067
You are the traitor.

246
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:39,600
Just kill me!

247
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,633
I can't just recklessly kill you here.

248
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,433
Cooperate.

249
00:23:47,433 --> 00:23:52,500
If you do, I'll give you a big reward.

250
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:56,333
If we were to sell our beliefs for rewards,

251
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:58,867
we wouldn't have even started.

252
00:23:58,867 --> 00:24:01,000
Just kill me now.

253
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:08,767
I'll train him mentally
right up until he's about to die.

254
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,300
Shouldn't you turn off
the surveillance cameras first?

255
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:50,667
Your injuries seem serious.

256
00:24:55,467 --> 00:24:59,033
So? Have you thought about it?

257
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:03,533
If you go back to the North now, you'll die.

258
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,167
Don't you want to live?

259
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:12,467
I'm not even hoping for Shadow.

260
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:14,733
Let's just catch one from the upper ranks.

261
00:25:14,733 --> 00:25:16,100
Then we'll climb up…

262
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,267
Kill me.

263
00:25:19,633 --> 00:25:22,267
I will never betray.

264
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:26,633
Betrayal?

265
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,133
What era do you think this is?

266
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:34,200
You're so frustrating.

267
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,067
Song I, I'm here.

268
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:52,533
I'm sorry.

269
00:25:52,533 --> 00:25:56,500
I don't have anything to tell you yet.

270
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:08,400
I'll come again.

271
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:55,633
Where do you think you're going?

272
00:26:55,633 --> 00:26:58,533
It's none of your business.

273
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,467
I saw what you took.

274
00:27:00,467 --> 00:27:02,533
Please don't go.

275
00:27:05,867 --> 00:27:07,767
Do you want to get beaten up badly?

276
00:27:07,767 --> 00:27:09,100
Keep your hands off me.

277
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,233
Are there missions that even
the unit members are unaware of?

278
00:27:11,233 --> 00:27:14,033
It clearly looks dangerous, so don't go.

279
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:19,800
It's not like that, so don't worry.

280
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,200
Do you know that I'm worried?

281
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,600
Major General

282
00:27:33,867 --> 00:27:36,100
Please don't go.

283
00:27:40,233 --> 00:27:43,300
- Let's go, move!
- Where are we going?

284
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,433
Can't you tell? We're going on a mission.

285
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:46,467
I'm the only one who doesn't know again.

286
00:27:46,467 --> 00:27:49,100
Now that you know, get ready.

287
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:52,767
No need to get ready.

288
00:27:52,767 --> 00:27:54,867
- Why?
- It's an order to come to the control tower.

289
00:27:54,867 --> 00:27:57,100
Just me?

290
00:28:14,367 --> 00:28:17,467
[Caller ID Restricted]

291
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,900
Where are you?

292
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,033
I got out.

293
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:28,033
What about Comrade Gyeong Hoon?

294
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,100
I'm sorry. Only I got out.

295
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:37,567
Good job, Sung Eun.

296
00:28:37,567 --> 00:28:40,000
It's nothing.

297
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,967
I should have gotten
Comrade Gyeong Hoon out too…

298
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:45,333
There's nothing we can do.

299
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:46,433
Come back safely.

300
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,800
No.

301
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,300
They might be tailing me.

302
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,733
I'll disappear from here.

303
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:57,800
Comrade Seong, stay safe.

304
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:03,800
Sung Eun.

305
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,333
Come to our meeting point.

306
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:09,367
Comrade Seong, that's risky.

307
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:11,433
Comrade Seong!

308
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,767
Attention.

309
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:06,900
I'll be leading today's operation,
not Lieutenant Baek.

310
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,167
Yes, sir.

311
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:14,767
Did Comrade Lieutenant Baek get fired?

312
00:30:14,767 --> 00:30:18,333
It seems South Korea is
in charge of this operation.

313
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:20,600
That brat…

314
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,633
- Vice Commissioner Lee.
- You are here.

315
00:30:37,633 --> 00:30:38,767
What's the matter?

316
00:30:38,767 --> 00:30:41,233
This is where we control our operations.

317
00:30:41,233 --> 00:30:44,433
So sit back and enjoy.

318
00:30:44,433 --> 00:30:47,300
Having a strong backer must feel good.

319
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:26,600
Team 1 with 3 pairs,

320
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,300
move to Station 1.

321
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,233
Team 2, stand by.

322
00:31:30,233 --> 00:31:33,700
Don't move rashly until the order is given.

323
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:39,167
Vice Commissioner Lee, where is that?

324
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:42,400
That's Pyeonghwasi Climbing Park.

325
00:31:43,933 --> 00:31:46,200
My parents are coming, so

326
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,800
may I leave first?

327
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,800
Oh, really?

328
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,800
Sure, go ahead.

329
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,133
Go on.

330
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,367
Alright, Team 1 with 3 pairs,
get the target first.

331
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:01,433
Keep an eye on those people in sight.

332
00:32:01,433 --> 00:32:03,467
Don't miss them.

333
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:14,467
Let's just go.

334
00:32:17,033 --> 00:32:21,033
You know he wants to treat
you nice before you leave.

335
00:32:21,033 --> 00:32:23,400
But something feels off.

336
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,667
Alright, 10 o'clock direction. Close the gap.

337
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,567
I need to use the restroom.

338
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,333
Be quick.

339
00:33:01,867 --> 00:33:03,933
Comrade Seong.

340
00:33:09,433 --> 00:33:11,567
Thanks for your hard work.

341
00:33:36,033 --> 00:33:38,700
Isn't he Seong Jae Hoon?

342
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,033
Target spotted.

343
00:33:41,033 --> 00:33:43,133
Go, go.

344
00:33:43,133 --> 00:33:45,133
Shoot him.

345
00:33:50,433 --> 00:33:53,300
Okay, 2 o'clock from the restroom.

346
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,800
Second target.

347
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,933
Permission to kill.

348
00:34:05,033 --> 00:34:07,067
Freeze!

349
00:34:56,067 --> 00:35:00,200
I know that sniping is done
from the highest point.

350
00:35:07,533 --> 00:35:10,467
Six of our men were hit by a sniper.

351
00:35:10,467 --> 00:35:13,433
But none of them died.

352
00:35:13,433 --> 00:35:16,900
Because they were all
wearing bulletproof vests.

353
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,033
No, no.

354
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:22,967
It's because the sniper
only aimed at the vests.

355
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:24,933
Isn't it strange?

356
00:35:24,933 --> 00:35:26,967
Why would they do that?

357
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Why did you do this?

358
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:39,333
Answer me. Why did you do this?

359
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:42,333
Even if I tell you, you won't understand.

360
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:45,900
Don't get involved and arouse suspicion.

361
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:51,267
Is that the best you can say?

362
00:35:51,267 --> 00:35:54,567
To someone who rushed here
out of worry for you?

363
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,600
You shouldn't have.

364
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:11,700
Darn it!

365
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:44,467
Unauthorized overnight stay
is considered desertion.

366
00:36:44,467 --> 00:36:45,767
Comrade Vice Commissioner.

367
00:36:45,767 --> 00:36:48,400
Our Lieutenant is not a deserter.

368
00:36:49,533 --> 00:36:52,133
This is not a place for a rascal.

369
00:36:52,133 --> 00:36:54,133
Arrest her.

370
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,567
What do you think you're doing?

371
00:37:00,233 --> 00:37:02,833
I'm taking Lieutenant with me.

372
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,400
Why are you taking her?

373
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,633
Because she's mine!

374
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:16,633
♫ Don't go away ♫

375
00:37:16,633 --> 00:37:19,800
♫ Please don't let go of my hands ♫

376
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,367
♫ I need you, don't go away ♫

377
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:26,500
♫ It has no other meaning to me ♫

378
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,667
♫ Only you ♫

379
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:31,900
♫ I'm standing alone ♫

380
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,033
♫ In the cold ♫

381
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:36,433
♫ I'm standing alone ♫

382
00:37:36,433 --> 00:37:38,667
♫ I can't be with you no more ♫

383
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:42,367
♫ Our end is coming ♫

384
00:37:42,967 --> 00:37:46,033
♫ Who will understand my feelings?
Oh, my heart ♫

385
00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:49,767
♫ Only you can know. No, my heart ♫

386
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,267
♫ I can't be with you no more ♫

387
00:37:52,267 --> 00:37:54,933
♫ A little more, a little more ♫
