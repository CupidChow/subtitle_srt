3
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,400
She won't die, right?

4
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,833
I'm sure she'll survive if you
desperately wish for that.

5
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,367
We were ordered to return before the roll call.

6
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:50,833
Let's pack up and go back now.

7
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,300
I'll stay here a little longer.

8
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:56,200
You're not her guardian, okay?

9
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:08,967
Hold on.

10
00:01:08,967 --> 00:01:11,333
This wasn't a mere accident.

11
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,900
It seems odd no matter
how hard I think about it.

12
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,300
What's odd about it?

13
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,100
It's totally obvious. Why
do you pretend it's not?

14
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,533
You know what happened
to her that night, don't you?

15
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:25,000
I'll report it to my superior
to look into it further.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,700
So just focus on your
military duties, Comrade No.

17
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,000
- Got that?
- Please listen--

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,033
Unification.

19
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:43,767
Lloyd, where have you been?

20
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, my gosh. You guys,
are you still doing that?

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,233
Enough already.

22
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:59,067
That's right. Give up now, Comrade Gang.

23
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:01,600
Are you asking a former UDT soldier to give up?

24
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,033
I'd rather die.

25
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,967
Why are they doing that?

26
00:02:06,967 --> 00:02:08,133
It's the problem of deciding
how to call each other.

27
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:10,933
We all have different ranks
and come from different units.

28
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:12,733
That's why they're fighting.

29
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:16,133
The winner takes it all.
The person who wins gets to decide.

30
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:18,767
It'll be 30 minutes in 5 seconds.

31
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:27,033
Your feet hit the ground first.

32
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:28,467
What? Nonsense.

33
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:30,567
That's because I have long legs.

34
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,633
Your legs are so short, Comrade Gye.

35
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:34,100
What did you say?

36
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,900
Hey, be grateful that I call you a comrade.

37
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,467
I served five years in an anti-aircraft unit
and four years in Wonsan Special Forces.

38
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:42,033
I'm a Special Forces soldier
of the Republic, got that?

39
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:44,200
Do you want to battle it out
forgetting our ranks?

40
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,567
You didn't want to go against me
when we were discussing the pay grade.

41
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:49,344
Have you ever gotten
a special promotion as a reward?

42
00:02:49,344 --> 00:02:52,633
Capitalist financiers are quite scary.

43
00:02:52,633 --> 00:02:56,700
How are you a real soldier if you're
protecting your country to get paid?

44
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,933
I'm so sick of this, man.

45
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:01,300
You guys fight every day.

46
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,133
The unification is right around the corner.
Must you fight over things like that?

47
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:07,667
- Private, you stay out of it!
- Low-ranking soldier, none of your business!

48
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,567
What did you say?

49
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:12,333
Private? Why would you say that, bro?

50
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,367
Look at this.

51
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:15,267
What do you see, man? Nothing, right?

52
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:18,500
You know why? Because we're a team,
man. Nobody is ranked here, bro.

53
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,033
We're all fellow soldiers here.

54
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:25,233
But our ages are all different.

55
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:28,367
Okay, fine. Should we tell
each other how old we are too?

56
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,967
Okay. Over here. I'm John.

57
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:39,533
This guy is Lloyd. Cheol Gyu, Do Hyeon,
and my man, Comrade Gae. Okay?

58
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:43,067
It's not Comrade Gae. It's Gye.
My name is Gye Nam Sik.

59
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:44,300
Okay, "Gae."

- Gae.
- Gye.

63
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:50,867
- It's Gye Nam Sik.
- Gae.

64
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:53,600
Nam Sik. Comrade Gae. It's the same, man!

65
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,067
The pronunciation is different. It's Gye.

66
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:59,033
- Gye.
- Gae! Gae!

68
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,700
Did you discover anything?

69
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,900
There were traces of her
hacking secret files from Violet.

70
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,233
That's why they tried to kill her.

71
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:21,567
Did you find the file?

72
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:23,000
It wasn't on the hard drive,

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,733
and I couldn't find any traces
of it being uploaded online.

74
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:30,367
That means it's on a portable hard drive.

75
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:32,500
She didn't die, did she?

76
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:34,633
Is she awake?

77
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:37,233
Why does that matter?

78
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:39,600
So that we can ask her.

79
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:45,133
To me, what's important is
why she went to the hospital.

80

It's so hard to clean them all up.

I'm sorry. I'll clean them up right away.

83
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,233
But FITA fans are really
amazing. I give you that.

84
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:10,067
I'm always grateful to them.

85
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:12,033
But you even completed the march for survival.

86
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:15,900
Why did you request to return
to the Defense PR Support Unit?

87
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:20,600
I thought about it a lot, but
I don't think I belong to this unit.

88
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,700
Is it that lenient in South Korea that
they let you go to wherever you wish?

89
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,533

- Enjoy.
- Thank you so much!

ranks is important. Right?

Speak comfortably. I'll
take full responsibility.

00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:04,000
Okay. Sure.

100
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,933
What's wrong? What's going on?
Is someone chasing after you again?

101
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:44,533
Lloyd, you're okay, right?

102
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:46,500
Yes, I am. Are you okay?

103
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,267
Yes, I'm okay.

104
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:50,200
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

105
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,233
Don't say that.

106
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:54,100
I did what I ought to do.

107
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,400
It's okay. It really is.

108
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,300
It's really okay.

109
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,167
Where is that jacket?

110
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:03,167
What jacket?

111
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,467
My jacket.

112
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:09,633
I'll go lure them. You go
and call for help quickly.

113
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,033
You're right. Where is that?

114
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:14,200
I think I lost it.

115
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,067
I'll buy you a nicer one.

116
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:18,500
It's okay. I'll get going now.

117
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:25,300
Don't get hurt and make sure
you don't skip meals. Okay?

118
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,333
Okay.

119
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:30,867
See you again.

120
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,533
Yes, see you again.

121
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:35,200
I promise I'll make it happen.

122
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:53,333
Dear fans,

123
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,500
we're really grateful.

124
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,533
But please stop sending gifts now.
I'm going to die at this rate.

125
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:08,533
Lloyd, are you able to make phone calls now?

126
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:12,200
- Han Song I?
- Yes, her.

127
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,933
Can you check and see how she's doing?

128
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:19,367
If her operation went well and when
they expect her to wake up, you know?

129
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:23,867
But why? Sure. Okay.

130
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,167
Thank you, ma'am.

131
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:09,933
Ma'am? It's from the person over there.

132
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:19,067
What's this?

133
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:21,000
Parfait.

134
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,700
Parfait. Parfait.

135
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,000
You moved here recently, right?

136
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,233
It's a welcome gift.

137
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,000
Thank you.

138
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:36,600
Enjoy.

139
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,567
By the way, it's so pretty.

140
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:42,400
Since it's so pretty, it must be
that of South Korea, right?

141
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,633
That's not true.

142
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:45,967
There are many pretty
things in North Korea too.

143
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:49,400
There's nothing pretty in North Korea.

144
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:53,267
But I've never seen

145
00:09:53,267 --> 00:09:56,067
such a pretty girl like you in South Korea.

146
00:09:56,067 --> 00:10:00,100
They say that all male comrades
of South Korea are bluffers.

147
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,667
It's really true.

148
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,400
Who taught you that?

149
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,433
Well, it's a secret.

150
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,000
Gae…

151
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,033
Comrade Gye Nam Sik.

152
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:22,933
Don't talk to me.

153
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:25,333
I'm going to redeem myself from humiliation

154
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,767
of losing to Comrade Gang.

155
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:29,067
In my opinion, you definitely came out on top.

156
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:31,500
Why are you wasting your energy?

157
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:35,100
Really? It was obvious to you
too, right, Comrade No?

158
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,433
Yes.

159
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:38,700
I can tell that you're from the 112 unit.

160
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,067
How do you know about that place?

161
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,867
It's on YouTube.

162
00:10:42,867 --> 00:10:45,533
The ones that were trained
there are the toughest.

163
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:49,567
Your physique makes me think
that you were trained there.

164
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:52,100
I'm not worthy of being compared
to someone from the 112 unit.

165
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,433
They're warriors and legends.

166
00:10:55,433 --> 00:11:00,033
Comrade Lieutenant Baek is from that 112 unit.

167
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:05,667
So what? Once the unification
happens, it won't mean anything.

168
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:07,467
What did you say?

169
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:11,567
The ones from the 112 unit can't be spies
or terrorists now that things are peaceful.

170
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:14,033
After they got abandoned
by the Republic, they formed Violet.

171
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:15,633
Violet?

172
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,267
At the recent unification concert,

173
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:20,667
they tried to bomb the place.

174
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:22,733
I heard that they're members of Violet.

175
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:25,067
You didn't know?

176
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:29,167
I heard that some girl provided information.

177
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Wait.

178
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,467
A girl?

179
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:38,067
- Yes.
- How would you know?

180
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:42,433
Tell me.

181
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:51,667
Who are you?

182
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:53,667
[Attorney Seo Hee Ji]

183
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:57,233
There are some issues about assigning Mr. Lloyd

184
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:59,800
to the Unified Armed Force Unit.

185
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,100
Issues?

186
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,933
Soldiers follow orders, that's all.

187
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,000
This is a document that's ordering him
to be assigned to the Defense PR Support Unit.

188
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:13,267
This is evidence showing
that it wasn't based on orders.

189
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,900
What does it have anything to do with me?

190
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,533
You even had a call with the HR
personnel at the defense ministry.

191
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:23,467
You didn't use a safe line.

192
00:12:24,367 --> 00:12:27,333
I even have a recording of the call.

193
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,900
Shall we listen to it together?

194
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,167
Ms. Seo.

195
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:38,200
When you're doing what's best for our country--

196
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,433
You're not trying to tell me,
a lawyer, that I have to

197
00:12:42,433 --> 00:12:44,867
break the law sometimes?

198
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:56,133
I'm not asking for much.

199
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:59,433
You just need to send him
back to where he belongs.

200
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:04,233
Please send our superstar
to the Defense PR Support Unit.

201
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,033
Mr. Lloyd? This is Seo Hee Ji calling.

202
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:16,100
You'll receive an order to return
to your original unit by tomorrow.

203
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:19,033
Yes.

204
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:22,000
It got resolved much faster than I anticipated.

205
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:28,467
If you're so grateful, I'll give you
an opportunity to pay me back.

206
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,000
Let's grab a meal together.

207
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,633
Come in.

208
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,067
Unification!

209
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:43,667
What brings you here?

210
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:47,300
Are you going somewhere? Dressed like that?

211
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:49,933
Is there a problem?

212
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:51,533
Well, I heard

213
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:53,767
that you're from the 112 unit.

214
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:56,333
You must've been very busy at your hometown.

215
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,467
Was that man I saw before
your child's father? Am I right?

216
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:03,600
Don't cross the line.

217
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,133
Don't test my patience.

218
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,800
Wait, hold on.

219
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,433
A leave pass.

220
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:12,133
Please give me a leave pass.

221
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,967
A leave pass?

222
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:17,800
I'm still under the Unified
Armed Force Unit for today.

223
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,467
♫ I feel kind of clumsy and awkward ♫

224
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:29,233
♫ So I pretend to look away ♫

225
00:14:29,233 --> 00:14:31,900
♫ After a day ♫

226
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,167
♫ And after a month ♫

227
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:35,467
Why do you keep following me?

228
00:14:35,467 --> 00:14:37,933
Me?

229
00:14:37,933 --> 00:14:39,233
I feel flustered.

230
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:40,600
Please don't follow me, okay?

231
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,233
I'll get going first.

232
00:14:42,233 --> 00:14:44,400
Sis!

233
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,267
Mi Rae.

234
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:48,367
Not "Mother"?

235
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,233
"Sis"?

236
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:54,000
I'll come this weekend, so don't worry, okay?

237
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,033
Are you doing well?

238
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,867
I saw Lloyd earlier.

239
00:14:58,867 --> 00:15:01,333
That singer who came to
the Unified Armed Force Unit?

240
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,733
Yes.

241
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:05,867
I should've got his autograph and posted it
on the wall of our convenience store.

242
00:15:06,467 --> 00:15:08,267
Our dear Peace and Unification,

243
00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:11,533
it'd be like winning a lottery
if they'd be as good-looking as Lloyd.

244
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:13,200
What are you saying?

245
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,300
Yu Jin, they need to take
after you and me, honey.

246
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,667
Don't you worry.

247
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,667
Of course, they'll look like you,
their parents. Who else?

248
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:23,800
You have to eat well for your
babies to be healthy, okay?

249
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,633
I wish

250
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:28,100
I could enter the demilitarized zone

251
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,100
and catch a deer for her to eat.
That would be so great.

252
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,467
Thank you for the thought,

253
00:15:32,467 --> 00:15:35,200
but I don't want you to get arrested.

254
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,700
The Unified Armed Force Unit is comprised
of all elite soldiers. What if you get caught?

255
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,167
Whatever.

256
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:41,967
Elite soldiers, my foot.

257
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:45,667
Any North Korean man would be as good as them.

258
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:48,200
I see. Is that right?

259
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:52,533
I think we have more customers after
the Unified Armed Force Unit was formed.

260
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:54,567
What about here?

261
00:15:55,433 --> 00:15:57,633
Yes, perhaps.

262
00:15:57,633 --> 00:15:58,733
Hey, eat this too.

263
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:00,667
You eat up too, honey.

264
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,667
Eat the meat.

265
00:16:06,267 --> 00:16:08,433
Thank you.

266
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:16,300
This is a pub, but the food is quite good
even though the place is small.

267
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,933
It has a good ambiance too.

268
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:20,567
You're here.

269
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:22,567
Hello.

270
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:25,033
Is this that VIP?

271
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:26,767
You know each other, right?

272
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:30,333
Yes, we do. We meet again.

273
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,767
I'm Seong Jae Hoon.

274
00:16:31,767 --> 00:16:35,500
Avon… I meant, Mr. Lloyd.

275
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:37,933
Let's go somewhere else.

276
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:41,233
It has a good ambiance, but feels quite nasty.

277
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,167
You're here.

278
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:50,333
Why don't we all sit here together?

279
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,667
It seems like we all know each other.

280
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:56,300
No, thanks.

281
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:59,767
Cheers.

282
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,733
Ms. Seo, you're very good at what you do.

283
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:14,733
Let's talk casually to each
other. We're the same age.

284
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,100
What? Are you serious?

285
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,500
Why do you react like that?

286
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,733
No, I didn't mean anything bad.

287
00:17:19,733 --> 00:17:23,967
I've never seen any lawyer
as young and pretty as you.

288
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:27,433
I tend to be faster than
everyone else in everything.

289
00:17:27,433 --> 00:17:30,100
Graduating from schools, handling cases,

290
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,433
and having an eye for things.

291
00:17:32,433 --> 00:17:33,767
Cheers.

292
00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:34,767
Try the drink.

293
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:37,100
Okay.

294
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,500
That drink.

295
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,900
It's a cocktail that Mr. Seong
made himself with blueberry wine.

296
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,700
You even know how to make drinks?

297
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,700
Yes.

298
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,933
Now I see who he was thinking of
when he was making the drink.

299
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:58,900
Congratulations on returning
to the PR Support Unit.

300
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,900
Thank you.

301
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,300
Did you hear that? I'm leaving soon.

302
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:08,767
You keep irritating me.

303
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,467
She's your superior.

304
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:13,500
She's my superior, not yours.
So why don't you mind your own business

305
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,433
and go make that blueberry
cocktail or whatever that is?

306
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:18,000
Just let him be.

307
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,700
He's no longer in my unit.

308
00:18:22,233 --> 00:18:25,567
Congratulations, Comrade No. Farewell.

309
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:33,233
Ms. Seo, have you heard of Violet?

310
00:18:33,233 --> 00:18:35,767
Do you mean, the purple color?

311
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,967
Yes, the purple color.

312
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:43,667
When I was little, I made it
often by mixing blue and red.

313
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:46,833
I liked that color, so I always needed more.

314
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:52,533
Maybe she jumped right in front of there,
so that Lloyd would see her, you know?

315
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:54,133
No way.

316
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,167
So many stalkers would risk their lives
to get the stars' attention, you know?

317
00:18:57,167 --> 00:18:59,067
The kids these days are really scary.

318
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:02,000
You're right. Some even jump
to the front of the celebrities' cars.

319
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,233
They don't mind dying
if it's for their beloved singer.

320
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:06,400
Excuse me.

321
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,233
Watch your mouth if you don't
really know what happened.

322
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:11,767
- My fan was in an accident.
- Wait, it's Lloyd.

323
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:14,900
She isn't a stalker or whatever
you think she is. Got that?

324
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,767
If she isn't, so be it.
Why are you yelling, man?

325
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:18,667
- Who cares if you're a celebrity?
- What did you say?

326
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:20,767
- Do you want to hit me?
- Were you there?

327
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:23,233
How would you guys know
if my fan was a stalker or not?

328
00:19:23,233 --> 00:19:25,533
The back door is over there. Come with me.

329
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:29,300
Words of people like you hurt others!

330
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,400
Thank you. Please go back in now.

331
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,100
Next time, let's meet somewhere quiet.

332
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,800
Why are you asking her to meet again?
Who will protect Pyeonghwasi then?

333
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:57,500
Hey, I heard that Lloyd is really here.

334
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,567
Really?

335
00:19:58,567 --> 00:20:01,367
- Is Lloyd really here?
- Seriously.

336
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,200
What if someone recognizes you again?

337
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,067
Are you worried about me right now?

338
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,133
Hold onto this tightly next
time you have a nightmare.

339
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:35,767
I can't be there to hold your
hand every time, you know?

340
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,300
That bluffer.

341
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,767
I never held his hand.

342
00:21:19,267 --> 00:21:23,567
I'm still under the Unified
Armed Force Unit for today.

343
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:25,600
I'm leaving soon.

344
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,333
What are you doing?

345
00:22:19,767 --> 00:22:22,000
What are you doing here, Comrade No?

346
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,133
I thought you might need this.

347
00:22:25,467 --> 00:22:26,800
Thank you.

348
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,267
That sounded so insincere.

349
00:22:29,267 --> 00:22:31,467
What do you mean?

350
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,933
At this rate, what's the point of
the unification? We can't even communicate.

351
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:39,333
Don't worry about stuff like that

352
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:42,133
and take care of your own business.

353
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,200
Thank you for everything.

354
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,433
I'll never forget you.

355
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,167
When you return, forget
everything that happened.

356
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:53,167
But how could I?

357
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:55,733
We were so dynamic together.

358
00:22:58,867 --> 00:23:03,533
In any case, I'm worried about
Song I that I can't even sleep.

359
00:23:03,533 --> 00:23:08,333
Other people think she was a stalker
who tried to commit suicide.

360
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:12,967
But I know it well that
my fans would never do that.

361
00:23:15,033 --> 00:23:18,633
Since she didn't die,
the truth will be revealed.

362
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:21,967
Please visit her often to see how she's doing.

363
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,200
Please.

364
00:23:29,433 --> 00:23:31,167
Will do.

365
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:33,167
Thank you.

366
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:37,167
Then I'll…

367
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:39,367
go now.

368
00:23:40,767 --> 00:23:42,633
I almost forgot.

369
00:23:42,633 --> 00:23:46,267
Don't forget. Go see a doctor when you're sick
and go to a pharmacist when you need medicine.

370
00:23:46,267 --> 00:23:50,233
Stay alert! So that you don't
get conned from now on.

371
00:23:52,033 --> 00:23:55,467
Comrade No, you talk too much
and worry too much too.

372
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,500
Take care.

373
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,767
Why do I talk so much?

374
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:23,567
I'll be made a private again there.

375
00:24:24,367 --> 00:24:26,900
My man, Lloyd.

376
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:32,167
- Take care, all right?
- You too.

377
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:34,233
Bye, No Gwang Yeon.

378
00:24:34,233 --> 00:24:36,733
Take care, Do Hyeon.

379
00:24:37,967 --> 00:24:39,000
Bye.

380
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,733
- See you after the unification.
- Sounds good.

381
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:48,100
Comrade No, we just met,
but we have to say goodbye.

382
00:24:48,633 --> 00:24:49,867
By the way, where is Lieutenant Baek?

383
00:24:49,867 --> 00:24:53,600
Comrade Lieutenant Baek is busy these days
with the Unified Security Agency work.

384
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:57,400
But still, couldn't she say goodbye at least?

385
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,800
You're a nobody.

386
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,833
You can't demand a farewell
from Comrade Lieutenant Baek, okay?

387
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:01,933
Leave now.

388
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:03,700
- Fine, Comrade Gae. I'll get going now.
- It's not "Comrade Gae."

389
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,867
- My name is--
- Okay, Nam Sik.

390
00:25:07,467 --> 00:25:09,533
Take care.

391
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,033
Lloyd. Are you all right?

392
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,633
Yes, I am. I'm totally fine.

393
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:34,533
It doesn't seem like you are.

394
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,233
Hey, I feel so relieved.

395
00:25:38,233 --> 00:25:40,433
I told you that I almost died in that unit.

396
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:42,867
That doomed place.

397
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,167
Then, maybe you don't need
this, but I got a gift for you.

398
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:51,467
I wonder if you'll like it.

399
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,633
What? It's the U.S.N. M9.

400
00:25:56,633 --> 00:26:00,233
I'm the one who ordered it from abroad.
Why does it count as your gift for me?

401
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:01,400
The thing is

402
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,600
that it was held in customs because of
the unpaid taxes. I brought it to life.

403
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,300
So I contributed.

404
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,633
My goodness. Thank you.

405
00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:12,133
You're an amazing manager.
Thank you for your hard work.

406
00:26:12,133 --> 00:26:13,500
Thank you.

407
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,033
No, I should be thanking you.

408
00:26:21,233 --> 00:26:24,433
♫ I close my eyes ♫

409
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:28,033
♫ Naturally ♫

410
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:33,967
♫ You come to my mind ♫

411
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:37,800
♫ It was so picturesque ♫

412
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,600
♫ When I think of that moment ♫

413
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,567
♫ It just makes me laugh ♫

414
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,733
♫ I don't want to forget ♫

415
00:26:53,633 --> 00:26:58,233
♫ I call your name endlessly ♫

416
00:26:58,233 --> 00:27:02,367
♫ But there is no answer ♫

417
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:09,033
♫ I can't control my heart ♫

418
00:27:09,033 --> 00:27:12,500
♫ Can't you hear ♫

419
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,467
♫ My heart ♫

420
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:22,433
♫ The harder I try to hold on to you ♫

421
00:27:22,967 --> 00:27:29,667
♫ You feel so far away ♫

422
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:33,000
♫ To not let go ♫

423
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,567
♫ I'm trying so hard ♫

424
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:41,367
♫ But you seem so unaffected ♫

425
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:43,833
♫ You ♫

426
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:50,033
♫ On that dark night ♫

427
00:27:50,033 --> 00:27:54,667
♫ You were like the wind ♫

428
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:07,133
Jeong Man.

429
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:09,833
Turn the car around.
Let's stop by at the hospital.

430
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:14,833
Lloyd, many reporters are saying
you joined military to escape criticism.

431
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:19,133
If the reporters see you at the hospital,
they'll make weird stories out of it.

432
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:21,333
It'll be hard to see her
again once I leave now.

433
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:24,600
Turn the car around.
I'll take full responsibility.

434
00:28:25,967 --> 00:28:28,500
Gosh, seriously…

435
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:42,767
That punk.

436
00:29:08,967 --> 00:29:14,333
I don't know what really happened,

437
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:17,333
but whoever did this to you
will get caught for sure.

438
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:21,933
She's a little slow sometimes,

439
00:29:21,933 --> 00:29:25,367
but she's the toughest fighter ever.

440
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:32,500
We made a deal to meet again, right?

441
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:37,567
You have to wake up soon to come
to my fan meetings and concerts.

442
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:41,467
I'll make an exception and
send you a special invitation too.

443
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:54,267
You protected me,

444
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,700
but I couldn't do anything for you.

445
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:09,467
I'll get going now.

446
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:10,267
Lloyd, are you okay?

447
00:31:57,467 --> 00:31:59,733
Since you betrayed the Republic,

448
00:31:59,733 --> 00:32:02,767
I thought you, the members
of Violet, had a good justification.

449
00:32:02,767 --> 00:32:06,267
Do you really have to kill a girl
who is already in a critical condition?

450
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,467
You punk.

451
00:32:09,467 --> 00:32:11,500
Why did you do that?

452
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:16,467
Why did you do that?

453
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:20,667
Why?

454
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:21,800
♫ Believe that you will return ♫

455
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,500
♫ Whatever it is, I believe in you ♫

456
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,767
♫ I can't find you anymore ♫

457
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:27,367
♫ I believe in our hearts in those days ♫

458
00:32:27,367 --> 00:32:30,233
♫ Even though it may be foolish
to turn around ♫

459
00:32:30,233 --> 00:32:31,967
♫ Back to that time on my way ♫

460
00:32:31,967 --> 00:32:34,133
♫How are you doing? Goodbye ♫

461
00:32:34,133 --> 00:32:37,500
♫ Who will understand my feelings?
Oh, my heart ♫

462
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,267
♫ Only you can know. No, my heart ♫

463
00:32:41,267 --> 00:32:43,867
♫ I can't be with you no more ♫

464
00:32:43,867 --> 00:32:45,533
♫ A little more, a little more ♫

465
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:47,500
♫ I'm getting closer to you ♫

466
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,267
♫ Don't look back and don't hesitate ♫

467
00:32:50,267 --> 00:32:52,933
♫ This day won't come again ♫

468
00:32:52,933 --> 00:32:54,033
♫ Tonight ♫

469
00:32:54,033 --> 00:32:57,767
♫ Don't turn away ♫
