1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:02,667
Go back now.

2
00:00:02,667 --> 00:00:06,133
Fine, I'm going.

3
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:11,033
But I've got to do something before I go.

4
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:32,933
What were you thinking?

5
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,633
It's time for roll call.

6
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:38,667
I was thinking the same.

7
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:41,500
It would be better if just the two
of us go for the next mission.

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,067
Didn't you say it was just for today?

9
00:00:43,067 --> 00:00:46,033
Have a good night. Unification.

10
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:48,667
Sleep well.

11
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:23,633
Yeah… This is my reality.

12
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:30,144
Snap out of it, Baek Yeong Ok.

13
00:01:30,144 --> 00:01:32,128
All me, baby, it's all me, baby.

14
00:01:32,128 --> 00:01:33,302
It's all right.

15
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,418
It's all me, baby.

16
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,833
That's so dope, right?

17
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,033
Matching shirts, do you agree?

18
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:42,656
Lloyd.

19
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:45,984
Let's go. I'll take your love, baby.

20
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,500
What are you talking about?

21
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,167
Wasn't the swimming pool the best?

22
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:51,500
It was my idea.

23
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,967
That's because Comrade Gang insisted.

24
00:01:53,967 --> 00:01:55,767
We didn't want that.

25
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:58,867
I'll come up with a better plan next time.

26
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:00,867
Hold on a second.

27
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:04,733
Are you suggesting we go on another date?

28
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:08,233
Who else but us would help you two?

29
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:09,967
Next time, let's do it outside.

30
00:02:09,967 --> 00:02:12,333
No, yo, let's go to Jeju Island.

31
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:15,133
No, how about a staycation for the six of us?

32
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:16,833
No, I've never been to Jeju Island.

33
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,167
We can't go to Jeju Island.

34
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:19,900
- Why not?
- It's defection.

35
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,200
- Defection?
- Everyone got carried away.

36
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,733
What the hell is defection?

37
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:27,067
- Don't say "defection".
- Let's go.

38
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,900
It's today.

39
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,500
It's not like we are wiretapped.

40
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,033
Why are you saying like that?

41
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:51,067
You should show me properly
this time, shouldn't you?

42
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:53,733
How do I do it properly?

43
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,633
Listen.

44
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,200
I'll prepare everything needed for the mission.

45
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,800
You can think about what to do or where to go.

46
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,367
Why should I?

47
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:06,900
Oh, seriously.

48
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,767
The key to a successful mission
is to learn, practice, and act.

49
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:12,933
You need to learn if you don't know.

50
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:14,733
Where can I even learn that?

51
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:17,700
In the old days, we learned
about love from books.

52
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,933
Nowadays, we search on YouTube.

53
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,533
Everything from a first kiss
and the thrill to dating spots.

54
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:24,567
Fine.

55
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:27,933
I'll take care of it, so
leave yourself out of this.

56
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:32,033
Can I count on your skills for
the operation, Comrade Lieutenant Baek?

57
00:03:32,033 --> 00:03:34,467
Can I?

58
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:36,500
Yes?

59
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:40,300
So, where's the date going to be?

60
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:42,267
Not today.

61
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:43,800
I made time especially for this.

62
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,067
We're not that free, either.

63
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:49,000
Exactly, you made time.

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,700
So spend it with someone important.
Why make such fuss with me?

65
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,000
Go.

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,133
Our team is very important to me.

67
00:03:57,133 --> 00:04:00,233
Just go while I'm saying nicely, okay?

68
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:02,700
I'm all set.

69
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,200
I mean, why are you all preparing?

70
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,533
We've all been ready for a long time.

71
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:10,600
Okay, then the four of you
who are perfectly prepared,

72
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,733
please have fun.

73
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:14,267
Bye.

74
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:15,933
Not going? Go.

75
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:19,200
Go!

76
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,933
Geez.

77
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:48,233
In the old days, we learned
about love from books.

78
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:51,233
Nowadays, we search on YouTube.

79
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:06,367
Do you want to come over for ramyeon?

80
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:07,467
When a man hears this,

81
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:08,867
- He can't resist.
- What is it?

82
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:11,600
"I love you?" "Do you want
to come over for ramyeon?"

83
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:15,733
Make some magical ramyeon.

84
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:18,333
In a sexy,

85
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,800
elegant voice, say "Do you
want to come over for ramyeon?"

86
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,233
Let's have some ramyeon. I'm hungry.

87
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:25,500
It means you love me, darling?

88
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,767
I'm the only one, right?

89
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:33,267
Do you want to have ramyeon?

90
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:41,833
Do you want to have ramyeon?

91
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:56,700
Do you want to have ramyeon?

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,033
What are you doing?

93
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:13,867
Just get on, hurry.

94
00:06:13,867 --> 00:06:15,800
You, leave right now.

95
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,567
- Oh, my.
- Ugh, what are you doing?

96
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,967
What's wrong?

97
00:06:33,467 --> 00:06:35,367
Hurry up.

98
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:37,500
Look over there.

99
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,133
Those clingy people, seriously.

100
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:44,300
They claim to be the best special
forces from North and South Korea.

101
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,000
Yet, look at how they're wasting
their military tracking skills like that.

102
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,867
Well, never giving up

103
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:54,767
is part of our military spirit.

104
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:58,567
Sure, that must be it.

105
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,133
Wait.

106
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,367
Your lips.

107
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:09,367
And that dress.

108
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,867
I've done some searching like you said.

109
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,200
Then, where shall we go?

110
00:07:20,967 --> 00:07:22,500
Haeundae Beach?

111
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,533
Yeosu's night sea?

112
00:07:40,267 --> 00:07:42,900
Home is where you wanted to go?

113
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,533
Barracks or home, home or barracks.

114
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:48,033
Who would choose a commuting
route as their dating spot?

115
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:51,467
You said you did all the studying and research.

116
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I did.

117
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,533
Then why here?

118
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:06,800
Do you want to have ramyeon?

119
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:11,767
What? Ramyeon?

120
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:15,700
Now? Here?

121
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:30,700
Of course, it's just ramyeon.

122
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,833
She literally meant ramyeon.

123
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,167
What was I expecting?

124
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:39,033
Where is picked radish?

125
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:43,133
This is how we make it.

126
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,067
Seeing the gimbap

127
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:51,700
makes me want to go on a picnic, doesn't it?

128
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,867
A picnic? No way.

129
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:54,933
Me too!

130
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,800
Mi Rae, do you want to have a picnic?

131
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,133
Does Mi Rae want to have a picnic?

132
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:03,500
Really?

133
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,133
Don't run like that. Be careful!

134
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:10,133
Oh, so heavy.

135
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:12,467
At least wear sunglasses.

136
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:14,000
What if someone recognizes you?

137
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,600
We're here to be seen.

138
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,667
Right?

139
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:18,767
Let's go.

140
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,024
Where are you going?

141
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:31,667
Lloyd.

142
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:34,367
Where did Comrade No go?

143
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:37,200
He went on a date with Lieutenant Baek.

144
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,433
I'm so thirsty.

145
00:09:39,967 --> 00:09:43,067
So he went with just Comrade Lieutenant Baek?

146
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:46,300
It must be, since it's a date.

147
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,100
How did a private get the better of me?

148
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,533
I have years of experience
in military operations.

149
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:54,000
Lloyd is so sneaky and petty.

150
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,067
What a schemer.

151
00:09:56,067 --> 00:10:00,333
Why do they keep moving around
in groups like it's a civil defense drill?

152
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:04,000
Stop touching it. You'll scratch it.

153
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,367
Comrade No.

154
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,967
Giddy up, horsie!

155
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:24,200
Hop on!

156
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:41,600
♫ I'm clumsy and awkward ♫

157
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,267
♫ But I try to act like it's nothing ♫

158
00:10:46,267 --> 00:10:49,000
♫ As a day goes by ♫

159
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,900
♫ And another month goes by ♫

160
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,133
♫ Will I be ♫

161
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:57,467
♫ A little closer to you then ♫

162
00:10:57,467 --> 00:10:59,933
♫ You and me ♫

163
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:02,300
♫ So special ♫

164
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,300
♫ Love my hurt ♫

165
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,833
♫ Only for you ♫

166
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,367
♫ I wish for you ♫

167
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:11,000
♫ I was hoping for romance ♫

168
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,800
♫ A heart-pounding day ♫

169
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,200
♫ My trembling heart ♫

170
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,167
♫ I'll give it to the season ♫

171
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:21,733
♫ Rising up to the sky ♫

172
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:24,000
♫ I promise you ♫

173
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,533
♫ For you ♫

174
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:29,533
♫ I'll give you the stars ♫

175
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:51,833
I'm sorry.

176
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,300
I'm so sorry.

177
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,467
That's something that doesn't make
sense in South Korean language.

178
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:01,667
It's not like you committed a crime.

179
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:03,733
Why say sorry?

180
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:05,800
Here.

181
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:09,600
Would you be full just eating that?

182
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:13,167
Follow me.

183
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:15,267
Wait, your stuff…

184
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:23,767
[Gwang Tae's Restaurant]

185
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,700
I'll get going now.

186
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,033
I have something to do.

187
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:30,600
Are you from North Korea?

188
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,700
Sorry?

189
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,633
That Snow White Rice Cake.

190
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:37,233
My kid used to love it.

191
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:40,300
I won't charge you,

192
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,300
so come in and have a meal.

193
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,700
Why are you just standing there?

194
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,967
Where's your hometown?

195
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,133
I don't know, either.

196
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:12,433
I defected when I was very young.

197
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:27,000
Yes.

198
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,533
Yes, got it.

199
00:13:46,967 --> 00:13:50,033
I'll come back for the meal next time.

200
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:52,200
Wait…

201
00:13:59,267 --> 00:14:01,300
Gwang Tae.

202
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,600
Good job.

203
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,500
If you make it, you get a doll?

204
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,567
How about whoever wins
gives the doll to Mi Rae,

205
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:21,667
and the loser grants the winner's wish?

206
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,300
Are you saying you'll beat me?

207
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:27,500
That's not what I meant.

208
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,033
It's just for fun.

209
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:31,233
So, are you in or not?

210
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,700
That was so close.

211
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,733
Here I go.

212
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:53,233
See, Mi Rae. I'll definitely score this one.

213
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:01,767
Nice shot, I won!

214
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,300
I still have the last arrow.

215
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,467
Even if you make it, it'll just be a tie.

216
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:14,600
You can win if you shoot from further back.

217
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,633
It won't work, though.

218
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,767
Wait, you're going that far?

219
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,833
I won.

220
00:16:03,267 --> 00:16:06,200
- Ow, ow.
- What happened?

221
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,467
Seems like Pyeong Hwa and
Tong Il want to come out soon.

222
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:11,467
They are kicking a lot.

223
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:15,367
Little ones.

224
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:17,433
We will meet very soon.

225
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:20,000
Just hang in there a little longer.

226
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:28,467
Ugh, so annoying.

227
00:16:31,467 --> 00:16:33,867
This gimbap doesn't even have pickled radish,

228
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,233
but it strangely still tastes good.

229
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:37,600
Do you like it?

230
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,333
I'm so annoyed that I lost the game,

231
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,733
but it's even more annoying
because it's delicious.

232
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:44,800
Granting a wish isn't an easy task.

233
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,800
So, what's your wish?

234
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,767
My wish is…

235
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:04,100
Tell me the most expensive thing.

236
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,300
Like a diamond ring worth a fortune.

237
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,333
Sing a song for me.

238
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,700
A song? Now?

239
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,267
A song?

240
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,100
That's such an easy wish.

241
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,200
It's not easy for someone.

242
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,300
Is it?

243
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,333
A song…

244
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,500
Hi, everyone.

245
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,833
I'm Lloyd from FITA, currently
serving in the military.

246
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:34,967
I came to sing…

247
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:36,667
Isn't that the real Lloyd?

248
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:39,067
while passing by.

249
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,733

I didn't know

266
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,967
Lloyd was that sneaky.

267
00:19:16,967 --> 00:19:19,700
It's so disappointing. We are a team.

268
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,733
Anyway, does Lloyd have
any relationship issues?

269
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:24,433
Of course there are issues.

270
00:19:24,433 --> 00:19:26,967
With Comrade No rushing
in like a moth to a flame,

271
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:30,867
I wonder if Comrade Lieutenant
Baek can handle it alone.

272
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:33,100
She definitely can't handle it.

273
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,267
Can a South Korean idol and a North
Korean officer make it to the end?

274
00:19:37,267 --> 00:19:39,367
Realistically?

275
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,900
It would be hard.

276
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,700
But I believe they can overcome that reality.

277
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,433
In Pyeonghwasi, youths from the North
and South got to know each other,

278
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:56,400
and a miracle happened where they fell in love.

279
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:02,367
I'm looking forward to
the future they will change.

280
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,533
Here, cheers.

281
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:06,567
Cheers.

282
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:14,200
It's so beautiful, isn't it?

283
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,267
What is it? You're making me nervous.

284
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,200
You're going to tell me
that it's only for today,

285
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,400
so I should forget about you, right?

286
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:42,733
The whole day felt like a dream.

287
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:45,100
I'm so happy

288
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:48,767
that I don't want to let go of this hand.

289
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,333
If you don't want to, then don't.

290
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,700
Look.

291
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,733
Even though it's so beautiful,

292
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:06,067
no one believes it will last forever.

293
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:08,433
After flying around like that,

294
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,000
it'll eventually pop.

295
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,033
Then we just blow it up again.

296
00:21:15,633 --> 00:21:18,600
If it pops, we can make a new one.

297
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,800
I'll take care of that.

298
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,200
You just stay by my side, Lieutenant Baek.

299
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:43,533
This is the black box footage from my car.

300
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:47,833
So, what do you want?

301
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,967
I already told you.

302
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:53,567
Send her back to where she was.

303
00:21:53,567 --> 00:21:56,267
That's too easy.

304
00:21:58,367 --> 00:22:01,567
This is worthy of execution.

305
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:03,500
Is this the answer you wanted?

306
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,167
I'm satisfied.

307
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:07,200
Okay, then.

308
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,133
When your mother wanted something,
she wouldn't let anything stop her.

309
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:15,533
Please send my regards to her.

310
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:17,533
Will do.

311
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:25,200
By the way, about Natasha
you mentioned last time.

312
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,600
Yes?

313
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,267
Could a miracle happen to me too?

314
00:22:29,267 --> 00:22:31,900
The photo on The Wall Of Peace.

315
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,800
I posted it, and this came up.

316
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:45,067
She is alive.

317
00:22:45,867 --> 00:22:47,867
Natasha.

318
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,500
We can finally meet.

319
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,367
Lieutenant Baek.

320
00:23:00,433 --> 00:23:03,867
The reason Song I came to see
me at the hospital that day.

321
00:23:03,867 --> 00:23:06,500
And the thing you were looking for.

322
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,067
I think I know what it is.

323
00:23:09,067 --> 00:23:11,600
What is it?

324
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,533
Isn't it the SD card in Song I's jacket?

325
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,900
So, you're saying you have it?

326
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,300
What's in it that everyone is searching for it?

327
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,033
It's a list of Violet agents.

328
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:38,267
But why are you telling me this?

329
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,233
Because that's causing you to worry about me.

330
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,367
Let's take a photo together.

331
00:23:52,367 --> 00:23:54,400
A photo?

332
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,200
You two take some.

333
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,200
We are fine. Let's leave.

334
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,500
I'll be sitting right in front. Don't worry.

335
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:56,033
I think the fourth photo came out the best.

336
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,633
- Mi Rae.
- Mi Rae.

337
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:08,233
- Where is she?
- Mi Rae.

338
00:25:09,267 --> 00:25:11,500
Mi Rae.

339
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:15,167
Mi Rae.

340
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,667
Mi Rae.

341
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:25,067
Mi Rae.

342
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:34,000
Mi Rae.

343
00:25:37,733 --> 00:25:40,300
I couldn't find her anywhere.

344
00:26:03,933 --> 00:26:06,500
Comrade Seong Jae Hoon…

345
00:26:07,467 --> 00:26:09,400
Don't worry.

346
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,333
What he wants is the list.

347
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:13,600
We can't do that.

348
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,900
Then what about Mi Rae?

349
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,667
I'll take care of this.

350
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:19,967
Trust me this time.

351
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:23,100
I'll bring her back at all costs.

352
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,933
There's…

353
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:34,933
something I couldn't say.

354
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,233
Tell me when I come back.

355
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:48,000
I knew you had it.

356
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,433
Just to confirm that

357
00:26:51,433 --> 00:26:54,433
you even kidnapped a sick kid?

358
00:26:54,433 --> 00:26:55,900
I've been wondering

359
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,700
why Han Song I would risk
her life to come find you.

360
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,833
It wasn't simply out of concern, was it?

361
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:04,867
Where is Mi Rae?

362
00:27:05,433 --> 00:27:08,700
That thing has nothing to do
with you. Give it back to me.

363
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:17,533
Answer me. Where is she?

364
00:27:18,133 --> 00:27:20,133
Sleeping.

365
00:27:26,267 --> 00:27:28,667
You.

366
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:33,233
Stay away from Mi Rae and Lieutenant Baek.

367
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:38,167
If you hadn't butted in,
it wouldn't have come to this.

368
00:27:38,167 --> 00:27:39,200
Don't talk nonsense.

369
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,933
You're just a jerk who'll do
anything to achieve your goals.

370
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:46,867
On that list are the names of our comrades…

371
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:50,933
No, their lives.

372
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:56,600
Then Song I…

373
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:02,400
Did you do that to Song I too?

374
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,700
She brought it upon herself.

375
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:07,767
What are you doing, Seung Tae?

376
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:11,233
It seems he doesn't trust you.

377
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:14,133
He asked me to bring it to him myself.

378
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:26,267
Mi Rae.

379
00:28:26,267 --> 00:28:29,067
Are you okay, Mi Rae?

380
00:28:56,667 --> 00:29:00,000
How could you hand it over?

381
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,667
Who said I did?

382
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:05,667
The real one is already with you.

383
00:29:13,733 --> 00:29:17,767
Do you know the safest way to
boost your chances of winning?

384
00:29:17,767 --> 00:29:21,667
It's by teaming up with
reliable and skilled players.

385
00:29:30,933 --> 00:29:33,667
When the SD card came into my hands,

386
00:29:33,667 --> 00:29:36,900
I chose you as my teammate.

387
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,100
Here it is, ta-da!

388
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,167
This isn't a game.

389
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:49,333
- This is a matter of…
- A matter of life and death reality.

390
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,033
That's why I should have chosen
my teammates more carefully.

391
00:29:53,033 --> 00:29:56,000
Just wait. We will definitely win.

392
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,367
I've never lost in this area.

393
00:29:59,367 --> 00:30:02,600
Later, I should play a game with Mi Rae.

394
00:30:03,233 --> 00:30:06,567
So, it's been there all along?

395
00:30:06,567 --> 00:30:07,833
Yes.

396
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:10,067
It's been right next to you all this time,

397
00:30:10,067 --> 00:30:13,000
but you missed it, just like you missed me.

398
00:30:16,133 --> 00:30:17,833
Tell me now.

399
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:20,433
You said you had something to say.

400
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,100
If it's a prank again…

401
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,100
Yes.

402
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:30,633
I was the one who lied, not Comrade Lloyd.

403
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,733
Bringing someone home
in the middle of the night,

404
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:39,467
it seems you've had quite a romantic time.

405
00:30:39,467 --> 00:30:41,533
It's not like that.

406
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:42,733
Baek Yeong Ok.

407
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:44,700
You are being repatriated for
treason against the Republic.

408
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,267
Comrade Vice Commissioner.

409
00:30:46,267 --> 00:30:47,633
What do you mean by "treason"?

410
00:30:47,633 --> 00:30:51,300
We've got evidence that you
have been meeting Seong Jae Hoon.

411
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,400
It's also related to
the recent shooting incident.

412
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,400
Vice Commissioner Park.

413
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,700
I told you she was with me that night.

414
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:03,300
If you don't want yourself to be charged
with treason too, stay out of it.

415
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,467
Why am I accused of treason?

416
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:08,933
Comrade Vice Commissioner.

417
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:12,400
Comrade No has nothing to do with this.

418
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,000
Then quietly follow me.

419
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,567
Lieutenant Baek.

420
00:31:44,967 --> 00:31:46,567
Yeong Ok?

421
00:31:46,567 --> 00:31:48,167
Vice Commissioner.

422
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:49,467
Hands off me.

423
00:31:49,467 --> 00:31:51,233
Vice Commissioner Park,
what kind of law is this?

424
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:53,633
- Vice Commissioner.
- Yeong Ok.

425
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:56,200
- Mi Rae!
- Mi Rae!

426
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,367
Go away. She's dying.

427
00:31:58,367 --> 00:31:59,933
Mi Rae.

428
00:31:59,933 --> 00:32:01,267
- Mi Rae, are you okay?
- Mi Rae.

429
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:02,867
- Wake up!
- Mi Rae.

430
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:04,333
- Lieutenant Baek.
- Mi Rae.

431
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:05,467
I'll protect Mi Rae.

432
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:07,800
- Don't worry about her.
- Mi Rae!

433
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,167
- Mi Rae, are you alright?
- What happened?

434
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:10,667
Take her to the hospital, hurry!

435
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,700
Lloyd.

436
00:33:16,896 --> 00:33:20,151
[That file is fake.]
[That can't be possible.]

437
00:33:23,847 --> 00:33:29,704
[That file is fake.]

438
00:33:34,784 --> 00:33:37,352
["The Shadow" has left the chat room.]

439
00:33:49,184 --> 00:33:50,272
I guess that guy is a fan of him.

440
00:33:50,272 --> 00:33:52,328
He has a unique taste.

441
00:33:53,321 --> 00:33:56,335
♪ Come a little closer ♪

442
00:33:56,335 --> 00:34:00,424
♪ To the end of the sky with you ♪

443
00:34:07,467 --> 00:34:09,233
My little sister is in the hospital.

444
00:34:09,233 --> 00:34:12,033
Comrade, please let me make a call to her.

445
00:34:12,033 --> 00:34:15,400
Do you have any idea how serious this is?

446
00:34:19,133 --> 00:34:21,167
Treason is

447
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,067
punishable by death.

448
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,800
Let go of me.

449
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,333
I said, let go!

450
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,367
Lieutenant Baek.

451
00:34:46,367 --> 00:34:48,400
Stop.

452
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:52,033
They should at least say goodbye to each other.

453
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,833
Lieutenant Baek.

454
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:01,900
Comrade No.

455
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,067
Please take care of Mi Rae.

456
00:35:04,067 --> 00:35:06,500
If something happens to
her, tell Ms. Geum Sook…

457
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,633
Don't worry.

458
00:35:07,633 --> 00:35:09,167
She's fine in the hospital.

459
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:11,867
I'm also looking for a doctor.

460
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,533
Thank you.

461
00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:18,067
I'll bring you back to
Pyeonghwasi no matter what.

462
00:35:18,067 --> 00:35:20,467
We will definitely meet again.

463
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,367
Enough.

464
00:35:25,367 --> 00:35:26,867
Please don't worry.

465
00:35:26,867 --> 00:35:28,867
Lieutenant Baek.

466
00:35:28,867 --> 00:35:32,133
Let go.

467
00:35:40,067 --> 00:35:42,800
[Ministry of People's Armed Forces]

468
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,300
I will come back.

469
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,800
Definitely.

470
00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:31,000
Baek Yeong Ok was a double agent for Violet?

471
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,333
Yes.

472
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:34,167
Now that we've caught the informant,

473
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:37,700
we'll arrest all the remaining remnants.

474
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,833
But

475
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:40,100
why aren't you investigating in Pyeonghwasi,

476
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,967
but sending her directly to the North?

477
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:44,067
Look at this.

478
00:36:44,067 --> 00:36:45,500
It's very suspicious, ma'am.

479
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,600
Baek Yeong Ok is a republic
112 member, after all.

480
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,100
How can I recklessly investigate her?

481
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,233
That's right.

482
00:36:52,233 --> 00:36:55,067
I understand the North's stance too.

483
00:36:55,067 --> 00:36:57,133
Now, with the upcoming

484
00:36:57,133 --> 00:36:59,700
Peace Treaty Signing, we must
capture Violet as soon as possible

485
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,433
to prevent her from becoming an obstacle.

486
00:37:03,433 --> 00:37:05,733
Mayor Won.

487
00:37:05,733 --> 00:37:08,133
Get off me.

488
00:37:08,133 --> 00:37:11,167
How dare a private barge in here?

489
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:13,567
You know Han Song I, right?

490
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,067
Han Song I?

491
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,867
I have the Violet list that she left me.

492
00:37:18,867 --> 00:37:20,733
If you provide the original file,

493
00:37:20,733 --> 00:37:22,600
we will investigate its connections.

494
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,300
No, let's reveal it here.

495
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,533
In front of everyone.

496
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:30,067
Here?

497
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:32,367
This is the Violet list leaked from the inside.

498
00:37:32,367 --> 00:37:34,833
If Baek Yeong Ok's name isn't on it,

499
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:36,667
it means she was falsely accused.

500
00:37:36,667 --> 00:37:38,133
Falsely accused?

501
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:40,133
Where does this hack get off spouting crap?

502
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:42,167
Alright.

503
00:37:43,433 --> 00:37:45,500
- Mayor!
- Mayor!

504
00:38:07,967 --> 00:38:09,300
♫ Believe that you will return ♫

505
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,933
♫ Whatever it is, I believe in you ♫

506

♫ Who will understand my feelings?
Oh, my heart ♫

512
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,600
♫ Only you can know. No, my heart ♫

513
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,467
♫ I can't be with you no more ♫

514
00:38:31,467 --> 00:38:33,033

00:38:33,033 --> 00:38:34,967
