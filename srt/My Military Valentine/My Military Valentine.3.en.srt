 Our Hearts as One ❤️ Team@Viki.com 

2
00:00:46,267 --> 00:00:48,467
Number 127.

3
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:51,300
Do you still think you're Baek Yeong Ok,
the daughter of Director Baek Ri Soo?

4
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,833
You leeched on people's blood
and lived the high life in Pyongyang

5
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,967
eating well.

6
00:00:55,967 --> 00:00:58,667
Run faster.

7
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,600
Get out of my way!

8
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,500
I said, "get out of my way!"

9
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,500
Let me have some.

10
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:38,033
Let me have some.

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,367
Cut that out.

12
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:44,633
This is hell, got that?

13
00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:47,900
You have to step on and kill whoever it may be

14
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,067
- in order to survive. Got that?
- Take it now.

15
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:53,167
Come on. Take it now.

16
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:15,167
Did you really see Baek Yeong Ok?

17
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:18,467
Yes, sir.
I'm certain that it was Comrade Baek Yeong Ok.

18
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:21,420
You're saying, you got rid of her?

19
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:23,467
Yes, sir.

20
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:30,100
Seung Tae.

21
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:35,367
You can't just assume that you got rid of her.
It must be verifiable.

22
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,167
And you know that she's no match for you guys.

23
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:45,433
If you went out to catch a rabbit,
stick to the plan.

24
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:49,400
Why can't you realize that you could be killed
if you go after a tiger instead?

25
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:54,867
Stick with the rabbit. Got that?

26
00:02:54,867 --> 00:02:57,633
Yes, sir.

27
00:02:57,633 --> 00:03:00,800
Don't sacrifice your life
for a drill that's good for nothing.

28
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:03,767
We're not soldiers.

29
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,400
Where am I?

30
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,300
I'm alive.

31
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,700
Be quiet.

32
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,233
We're not safe yet.

33
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:45,533
By any chance, on your way over,

34
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:47,933
did you see a girl?

35
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:51,267
I sent her away safely in a car
that was driving by.

36
00:03:51,267 --> 00:03:53,300
That's why I was delayed.

37
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:56,333
You're amazing, indeed.

38
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,667
You're quite something yourself too, Comrade.

39
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:04,667
Pardon?

40
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,967
Putting one's own life on the line
for someone else

41
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:10,467
isn't an easy thing to do.

42
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:13,367
Is that what she said?

43
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:15,400
That I put my life on the line?

44
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,167
I wasn't thinking that at all at that moment.

45
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:21,500
If I really had to risk my life,

46
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,700
I don't think I could've done it.

47
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:27,633
I agree.

48
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:34,400
How is it possible that you can't contact
First Lieutenant Baek by radio?

49
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,367
She'd guard the walkie-talkie over her own arm.

50
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:38,533
She was trained at Wonsan 112.

51
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:41,700
Comrade Lieutenant Baek
was trained at Wonsan 112?

52
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,267
If you don't want to be
discharged dishonorably, find her at once.

53
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:50,967
Yes, sir.

54
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,120
[Personal Information]

55
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,688
[Name
Date of birth]

56
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:06,267
United force? Unification? You were all talk.

57
00:05:06,267 --> 00:05:08,667
I knew you were scheming something
behind my back,

58
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:11,367
but I didn't think you'd do that
in a dire situation like this.

59
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:12,733
Please calm down.

60
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:15,367
I was going to share it after I confirm it.

61
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:18,633
Share it? The Coordination Committee
changed everything already.

62
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:20,767
That's manipulation, not sharing.

63
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,867
A Violet member was among us.

64
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:26,100
She took Han Song I.

65
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,067
We, the Security Agency,
became a laughingstock.

66
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:34,233
So you intend to keep the incident a secret
by deleting the CCTV footages?

67
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:38,367
Can you be sure
that there's only one Violet among us?

68
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:39,767
It was a security issue

69
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:43,233
and I didn't intend at all
to handle it on my own.

70
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:47,467
Here. Look.

71
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:57,200
You know something. Don't you?

72
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,400
Don't blame it on North Korea
whenever there's an issue!

73
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,900
Fine, just say you don't.
Why are you getting mad?

74
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,200
You spat on me.

75
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:13,544
It's freezing.

76
00:06:16,032 --> 00:06:19,167
It's freezing.
How long do we have to stay here like this?

77
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:20,500
Don't you have a walkie-talkie or a cell phone?

78
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,000
We'll wait at least an hour before going back.

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,900
I saw you wearing a walkie-talkie
on your back earlier…

80
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,233
Are you hurt?

81
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:31,700
- I'm fine.
- But it looks like you're bleeding.

82
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,900
Are you okay?

83
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,367
Wake up.

84
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:39,400
Gosh. Wait.

85
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,533
I was in a variety show
getting the First Aid Certification.

86
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:49,233
Please don't get me wrong.
I'm trying to treat your wound.

87
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:57,900
If you press down hard like this,

88
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,367
I heard that you can stop the bleeding.

89
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:04,167
Lean on me like this.

90
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:08,233
Satisfied?

91
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:11,100
You punks are the best of the best
in both the North and South Korea combined.

92
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,767
But you were punished like simple soldiers.

93
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:13,900
No, sir.

94
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,900
You basically lost your heads and limbs today.

95
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,167
Got that?

96
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:22,167
Get up.

97
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:26,100
Do whatever it takes

98
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,833
to find her at once. Got that?

99
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,200
Yes, sir!

100
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,267
Let's go.

101
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:36,267
- Attention. Unification!
- Unification!

102
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:38,300
At rest.

103
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:42,533
Exactly the top of the hour.

104
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:43,733
Starting now until midnight--

105
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:46,333
Midnight, my foot.

106
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,400
Twenty-four hours.

107
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,700
No, even if we spend many days and nights,

108
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,433
if we can't find Comrade Lieutenant Baek,
we'll all be sent to a coal mine!

109
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,500
You don't use your brain.

110
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,000
That's why you fail even easy tasks.

111
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,433
What did you say?

112
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:01,167
I didn't say anything wrong.

113
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:03,867
This is all because of
that foolish South Korean comrade.

114
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:05,400
Don't you see?

115
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,200
No, no. Stop, stop.

116
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,867
We shouldn't blame each other. Come on.

117
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:12,900
We're like this because our teamwork is broken.

118
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,500
Hey, they don't know what "teamwork" means.

119
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,933
They only know to "charge forward."

120
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:20,267
You stinky breath. When I charge forward,

121
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,800
don't you bog me down.

122
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,133
Speak for yourself.

123
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:24,767
All right, let's go.

124
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:27,000
Let's go. Move, move.

125
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:41,133
Byoung Man said this is how you start a fire.

126
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:43,300
How come it's not working?

127
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,033
It seemed to work well in the jungle.

128
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,867
The moment you faint, you die.

129
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:18,100
Wake up!

130
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:25,733
Your father was
a high-ranking officer of the Republic

131
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:28,400
and your mother was
a professor at Kim Il Sung University.

132
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,100
Thanks to your proud parents
who were both powerful,

133
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,900
I'm sure you thought
your life would only be rosy.

134
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:44,167
Why are you doing this?

135
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:51,333
Honey!

136
00:09:57,533 --> 00:09:59,833
- Honey!
- Honey.

137
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,433
Father.

138
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:04,033
Please don't go.

139
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:06,233
Yeong Ok!

140
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,700
But you erased the shame
of being the opposition

141
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,900
and endured the hellish 112 training center
for South Korea.

142
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,167
Mother.

143
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,700
Mother.

144
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,967
Father.

145
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:42,767
Please don't go.

146
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,900
Become the best warrior of the Republic!

147
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,500
That will be the only way
you'll be able to wash away

148
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,533
your parents' sorrow
and to live together as a family.

149
00:11:12,267 --> 00:11:14,833
I should go call the emergency hotline.

150
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,833
She might die.

151
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,300
Don't… go.

152
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,300
Hey, look.

153
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,733
I have to go ask for help.
Otherwise, you might die.

154
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:33,333
Please… Please don't go.

155
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,400
What should I do? Seriously.

156
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:01,967
South Korean Comrade, take a break.

157
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:05,000
I'll look through the southeast side again.

158
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,867
Why would I take a break?

159
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:09,800
You might get lost too.

160
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,467
We should ask for help.

161
00:12:11,467 --> 00:12:13,433
Let's ask the superiors… for help.

162
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,333
- No, we're going to find her.
- We have to find her ourselves.

163
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,733
Wait!

164
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:25,767
Over there.

165
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:30,400
Call a medic. Call a medic!

166
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,300
- Medic. Call a medic!
- What? What happened?

167
00:12:58,367 --> 00:13:01,333
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

168
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,533
- Can you recognize me?
- Lloyd.

169
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:05,333
Mr. Ban was so worried about you.

170
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,333
This isn't a dream, right?

171
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:16,267
I would say, the dreamlike reality?

172
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,467
Why did you get so much?

173
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:26,500
Eat up.

174
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,900
Are you sure this is enough?

175
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,967
No, I'll go back in now and cook something…

176
00:13:31,967 --> 00:13:35,467
No, it's okay, Honey.

177
00:13:35,467 --> 00:13:38,267
It's just that I remembered the time
when we were in Kaesong.

178
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:40,333
You were enjoying the food so much.

179
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:43,067
Thinking about those days
is making me have cravings.

180
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:44,333
Yes, right.

181
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,700
Whenever I bought something,

182
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,333
you told me
that it was "buy one, get one free."

183
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,267
I thought it was strange.

184
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:52,367
I gave the "buy one, get one free" deal
only to you,

185
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:55,233
but you always gave me the extra one you got.

186
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:59,200
Is that why we're having twins too?

187
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:01,967
Our dear Peace and Unification.

188
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:04,900
Eat well and grow big.

189
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,200
Grow big.

190
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:09,467
Hello, you're here.

191
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:10,567
Not many days left, right?

192
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:13,167
No, just a month away.

193
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:16,067
May I have one of those?

194
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:18,300
Yes, sure.

195
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:40,633
Sir, what did the owner of Uno Pub do before?

196
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:42,600
I heard a rumor he's the third-generation scion
of a chaebol family.

197
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,433
Or is he a secret, illegitimate child
of a chaebol family?

198
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:48,567
Gosh, how would I know
the owner's personal information?

199
00:14:50,272 --> 00:14:52,233
Here you go.

200
00:14:52,233 --> 00:14:54,867
By the way, how come you always only eat that?

201
00:14:54,867 --> 00:14:59,333
Nowadays, even North Korea
makes different types of snacks.

202
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,800
She always

203
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,000
smelled so sweet just like this snack.

204
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:09,700
If you saw her face, would you recognize her?

205
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,333
No matter how many years go by,

206
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:17,033
I wouldn't be able to forget
her beautiful face.

207
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:27,333
Bye.

208
00:15:30,933 --> 00:15:34,344
- Hey, eat now.
- Okay. It'll get soggy.

209
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,600
Why the Unified Korean Special Armed Force Unit
of Pyeonghwasi out of nowhere?

210
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,100
No, it's the Unified Armed Force Unit.

211
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,167
Be quiet.

212
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:43,700
That's not the point here.

213
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,367
To keep Pyeonghwasi's peace,

214
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:47,600
they really need you. You have no choice.

215
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,400
Peace, my foot!

216
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,567
Hey! Do you even know
what I went through there?

217
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:54,233
Have you been in the military?

218
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:56,067
Me? Of course,

219
00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:57,100
I haven't.

220
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,000
- Have you done the counterterrorism training?
- No.

221
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,533
Have you battled against lunatics

222
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:04,200
who try to shoot you
and stab you from every angle?

223
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,233
No, I haven't.

224
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,767
While I was being bombarded with bullets,

225
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:13,100
I defeated the resistance army!

226
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,367
To save a fan of mine… a fan of FITA,

227
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:17,133
I escaped a gunman!

228
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:19,333
All night long, I carried a woman
who was like a human weapon,

229
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,500
walked a few tens of kilometers
through the DMZ,

230
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,600
and even saved a life. I'm that great.

231
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,700
You know that, right?

232
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:31,600
I had faith in you
that you'd pull through again.

233
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,700
What did I manage to pull through last night?

234
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,467
I'm insane. Seriously.

235
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:37,533
Your fans are totally excited

236
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:42,533
to hear that you've been assigned
to the Special Forces of Pyeonghwasi.

237
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:45,767
That news has been released officially already?

238
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:50,367
If this doesn't go well,

239
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:52,367
it'd jeopardize your image
as well as that of other members.

240
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:55,167
And the FITA fans
will be really disappointed too.

241
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:57,633
No, no.

242
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:58,833
What was it?

243
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:02,567
I saw a document that looked like an order
to transfer me to the Defense PR Support Unit.

244
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:06,267
How could they change the plan
without informing me?

245
00:17:06,267 --> 00:17:08,667
Hey, what happened to that plan?

246
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:10,867
Well, I'm not the one who planned it.

247
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:14,400
Hey. Get out.

248
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,433
Get out.

249
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,667
Doctor. I think I hurt my shoulder.

250
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:21,300
It hurts so much. Please take a look.

251
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,500
One moment, please.

252
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,333
Let me attend to the wounded patient first.

253
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,967
You shouldn't be sitting up.

254
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,133
What on earth are you doing here?

255
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,500
You bluffer.

256
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,033
What? Hey, Jeong Man.

257
00:17:42,033 --> 00:17:43,900
What did she say? Did she just curse at me?

258
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,667
She called you a bluffer.

259
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:47,833
My goodness.

260
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,467
Excuse me. If it weren't for me,

261
00:17:50,467 --> 00:17:54,267
you would've died already
from excessive bleeding. Do you even realize it?

262
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:58,500
Think carefully
why I even got stabbed in the first place!

263
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,800
Ms. Baek Yeong Ok, you have to stay
in the hospital to recover for a few more days.

264
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,233
No, I'm fine.

265
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:09,800
Please check on the head of that bluffer
who is talking nonstop over there.

266
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,467
What did you just say?

267
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:15,733
Mr. Lloyd, your test results are all normal

268
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:18,167
and you're only showing signs of exhaustion
and minor abrasion,

269
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:20,567
so you can be discharged even today.

270
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:21,967
Gosh, doctor.

271
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,133
I don't think that's the case.

272
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:26,133
I think I'm in a coma.

273
00:18:26,133 --> 00:18:27,767
Gosh, MRI, please.

274
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:28,967
My goodness.

275
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:30,933
It's all covered by the insurance,

276
00:18:30,933 --> 00:18:32,867
so please proceed with a CT scan too…

277
00:18:32,867 --> 00:18:34,900
But…

278
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:47,967
What a relief that Lloyd wasn't seriously hurt.

279
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:49,067
Even though Pyeonghwasi is on the outskirts,

280
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:52,467
firing away here is totally unacceptable, okay?

281
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:55,100
This isn't North Korea, you know?

282
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,700
If this happened in Pyongyang,

283
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,067
they would've been executed on the spot.

284
00:19:01,267 --> 00:19:05,967
The actions of Violet,
the anti-unification force, are troubling.

285
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:08,000
We can't let it slide this time.

286
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,367
We have to make
an official complaint to the North.

287
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:13,433
What evidence do you have
to be so sure that it was our doing?

288
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:15,467
Those Violet punks who are on the wanted list

289
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:17,167
are all from North Korea.

290
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:19,900
North Korean defectors
are from North Korea too.

291
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:25,600
I'm curious about who's behind it.
The one in the shadow.

292
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:32,500
Well, how would I know what these cunning
and selfish South Koreans are really thinking?

293
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,100
Okay, okay.

294
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,133
People who oppose our unification
can be anywhere.

295
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:40,400
Let's solve things one by one.

296
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:48,567
- Jeong Man.
- Yes?

297
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:50,033
What do you call that?

298
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:53,467
When the soldiers march
carrying their gears to their death.

299
00:19:53,467 --> 00:19:56,567
- Long distance loaded march?
- Yes, that one.

300
00:19:56,567 --> 00:20:00,800
I marched a long distance
carrying you on my back instead of the gear.

301
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,300
Instead of carrying me,

302
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,633
you should've run quickly to ask for help.

303
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:05,933
I was going to do that.

304
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:07,633
But you held onto my hand

305
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:10,833
and begged me not to go.

306
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,733
It's not like I was shot in the head.
There's no way I would've done that.

307
00:20:13,733 --> 00:20:14,833
Wow.

308
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:18,133
Listen to her. She's so shameless.

309
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,533
You don't remember?

310
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:23,000
Let me tell you what you did. You held my hand…

311
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:30,200
Don't leave me by myself.

312
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,067
Father. Mother.

313
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:38,667
Please. Don't leave me by myself.

314
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:07,200
Cut the nonsense

315
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,000
and just say what you want to say, Comrade No!

316
00:21:32,533 --> 00:21:35,567
I'm Vice Commissioner Lee Min Ho
of the Unified Security Agency of Pyeonghwasi.

317
00:21:35,567 --> 00:21:37,767
It's my pleasure meeting you.

318
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:40,567
Please don't say that. I almost died just now

319
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:44,300
thanks to you who allowed me to have
such a rare and precious experience.

320
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,967
It's my pleasure. Nice to meet you.

321
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:51,467
The Unified Armed Force Unit
doesn't operate in a traditional way.

322
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:55,867
The Unified Korean Armed Force Unit respects
individual's privacy as much as possible.

323
00:21:55,867 --> 00:21:59,300
On top of that, within Pyeonghwasi…

324
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:03,200
it's not difficult to go out or stay out.

325
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,600
You have a lot of freedom.

326
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,300
So what now?

327
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,267
You can't restore my life?
Is that what you're saying?

328
00:22:10,267 --> 00:22:11,933
I'm not saying that I can't.

329
00:22:11,933 --> 00:22:15,700
I'm saying that you'd be much happier here.

330
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,833
- Jeong Man.
- Yes, Lloyd.

331
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:20,933
Can you try calling Attorney Kim again?

332
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:22,033
Gosh, Lloyd.

333
00:22:22,033 --> 00:22:23,900
Mr. Lloyd.

334
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,667
You've become the hero of Pyeonghwasi.

335
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:28,833
You put on the gauntlet, okay?

336
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,900
"I am Iron Man." Like that?

337
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,500
Hey, wait. Please wait.

338
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,433
You can't do this without prior notice.

339
00:22:34,433 --> 00:22:35,967
We got a call.

340
00:22:35,967 --> 00:22:37,567
What? From who?

341
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:38,867
- Hello.
- Wait, come on.

342
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:41,067
Take a picture. Take a picture.

343
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:43,167
Mr. Lloyd.

344
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:45,167
How do you feel about joining
the Pyeonghwasi's Unified Armed Force Unit?

345
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:46,533
Do you feel okay?

346
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:49,567
We were informed
that you made a great impact from day one.

347
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:52,533
As you can see, I'm completely fine.

348
00:22:52,533 --> 00:22:55,467
The Unified Armed Force Unit
is Special Forces, you know?

349
00:22:55,467 --> 00:22:59,567
Perhaps because I've been working out regularly
as a singer,

350
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:02,367
I really enjoy doing the training
with the members of my troop.

351
00:23:02,367 --> 00:23:04,067
I'll be earnest and diligent

352
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:06,033
as I complete my military duty. Thank you.

353
00:23:06,033 --> 00:23:09,133
Please say a word to the FITA fans.

354
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:12,400
Dear FITA fans,

355
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,600
I'm doing well, so please don't worry.

356
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,867
After my service,
I'll return healthy and well to perform again.

357
00:23:19,867 --> 00:23:21,867
I love you.

358
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,000
We'll take a picture.

359
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,067
Picture, picture.

360
00:23:28,233 --> 00:23:29,467
Sir.

361
00:23:29,467 --> 00:23:31,067
We'll take a solo shot of Lloyd.

362
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:32,600
Just one shot, please.

363
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,733
Please step aside.

364
00:23:38,433 --> 00:23:40,733
- Please smile nice and big.
- Sure.

365
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:49,067
Comrade No, you're so shameless.

366
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,300
Please publish a nice article.

367
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,400
Will do.

368
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,267
[Cardiothoracic Surgery, Chief Bae Joong Jae]
Thank you.

369
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,867
Good to see you.

370
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,633
Yes, hello?

371
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:31,000
Wait!

372
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,133
Gosh. My goodness.

373
00:24:33,133 --> 00:24:36,067
People are reacting faster than I anticipated.

374
00:24:36,067 --> 00:24:39,333
"The idol star who is most confident even among
the Unified Korean Special Forces soldiers."

375
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:40,567
"Lloyd,"

376
00:24:40,567 --> 00:24:42,367
"a role model for all idol stars."

377
00:24:42,367 --> 00:24:47,367
"A global idol star has been reborn
as a hero of Pyeonghwasi."

378
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,700
Hero, my foot.

379
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,600
I nearly died. Thanks to you.

380
00:24:54,433 --> 00:24:57,933
It'll never happen again.

381
00:24:57,933 --> 00:24:59,100
I can guarantee that.

382
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,900
I guarantee this too.

383
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,167
If you don't restore my life,

384
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:07,367
I'll reveal every little thing

385
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:12,333
about how the Security Agency
put me in that unit without my consent!

386
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:16,067
Mr. Lloyd.

387
00:25:16,067 --> 00:25:18,700
I wasn't going to go this far and say this,

388
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,333
but do you recall why you joined the military?

389
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:23,133
Possessing an illegal weapon.

390
00:25:23,133 --> 00:25:25,033
That's a serious crime.

391
00:25:25,033 --> 00:25:26,233
Wow.

392
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,767
Some people have no conscience.

393
00:25:29,767 --> 00:25:32,867
Do you think you can threaten me with that?

394
00:25:32,867 --> 00:25:36,333
I'm sure you know that it was a fake gun.
I even have a witness.

395
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:39,967
A witness? Who?

396
00:25:39,967 --> 00:25:41,167
Hey, witness.

397
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:42,900
Comrade Baek.

398
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,567
Comrade Baek, tell him…

399
00:25:45,567 --> 00:25:48,167
What? Where did she go?

400
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:50,267
There's no one.

401
00:25:50,267 --> 00:25:52,867
Exactly my point. Did she go for a walk?

402
00:25:56,533 --> 00:26:00,500
Welcome to the Unified Armed Force Unit.

403
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,633
Where did she go?

404
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,700
Gosh, you startled me.

405
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,267
Didn't you hear me calling you?

406
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:23,467
Oh, you're that person from before.

407
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:24,500
You remember me, don't you?

408
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,300
I was going to go find you.

409
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,933
For… what?

410
00:26:28,933 --> 00:26:32,700
Can I buy that Golden Water right away?

411
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:38,000
We told you then too,
but it's really expensive.

412
00:26:39,067 --> 00:26:41,667
Give me ten bottles, please.

413
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:43,333
Ten bottles? That many?

414
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:47,700
Yes. You're sure
that it's good for the heart, right?

415
00:26:52,267 --> 00:26:54,933
I see. It's you who are not well.

416
00:26:54,933 --> 00:26:57,533
No, I'm fine.

417
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,633
If you drink Golden Water regularly,

418
00:26:59,633 --> 00:27:03,133
any illness will be healed completely.

419
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:07,167
This refined gold, you see,

420
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,567
kills bad cells
while helping good cells grow well

421
00:27:10,567 --> 00:27:12,867
and strengthens the blood vessels.

422
00:27:12,867 --> 00:27:17,067
It works wonders for hearts.

423
00:27:17,733 --> 00:27:18,967
"Wonders?"

424
00:27:18,967 --> 00:27:20,700
You don't get it, do you?

425
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,167
It expands the heart nice and full.

426
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:29,967
Nice and full…

427
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,533
If you drink it every day instead of water,

428
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:35,600
it'll be really good.

429
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,400
No words can describe it entirely.

430
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,533
So how much will do?

431
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:44,133
For now, go to a nearby ATM

432
00:27:44,133 --> 00:27:46,867
and pay us the deposit
of one million won in cash.

433
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:48,200
If you give me your address,

434
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,433
I can deliver it to you every month
for a monthly subscription.

435
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:53,467
Oh, right. You can pay in installments too.

436
00:27:54,367 --> 00:27:59,733
Monthly subscription? Installments?
What are they?

437
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,633
What else? They want to scam your money

438
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:05,567
every month on a regular basis.

439
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:08,033
Comrade No, stay out of it.

440
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:11,800
This is too terrible.
I can't stay out of it, Comrade!

441
00:28:12,933 --> 00:28:16,800
Young lad, you must be her boyfriend.

442
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,333
Don't be so rude. What do you mean, scam?

443
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:23,133
So, you mean, that's a cure-all?

444
00:28:23,733 --> 00:28:25,267
You haven't heard of Golden Water?

445
00:28:25,267 --> 00:28:26,800
It got the FDA approval this year…

446
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,633
Never.

447
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:31,400
Is it good for constipation too?

448
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,267
It really works wonders.

449
00:28:33,267 --> 00:28:35,167
It'll make your butt sob.

450
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:38,733
Wow, would it really?

451
00:28:38,733 --> 00:28:41,867
You won't be able to handle
the consequences if you're lying.

452
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,500
What do you mean, I'm lying?

453
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,233
Perhaps, you don't really know
since you're from North Korea.

454
00:28:48,233 --> 00:28:50,000
This is South Korea.

455
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,500
The healthcare and medical technologies
are gathered right here…

456
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,733
Then I'll try it.

457
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:55,600
What's wrong with you? This is quite pricy.

458
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,933
I'll pay you
ten times the asking price if it works.

459
00:28:57,933 --> 00:29:01,533
Besides, I'm South Korean.

460
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,900
Oh, no.

461
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,067
Llo… Lloyd?

462
00:29:10,867 --> 00:29:14,200
Okay, let's say I drink it and it's effective,

463
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,300
and then my fans will really thank you.

464
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,200
Because they know
that I've been suffering from constipation.

465
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,800
But if I get sick or something goes wrong
after I drink it,

466
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,033
then all your personal information
will be doxed

467
00:29:24,033 --> 00:29:27,200
and you'll be investigated by the police.
You can just guess what will happen next.

468
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,200
Thank you for this.

469
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,200
No, Lloyd!

470
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:33,533
Did you just call me that?

471
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:37,267
I'm in your fan club.

472
00:29:40,633 --> 00:29:43,200
♪ Keep your eyes on me every day, I want you ♪

473
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,267
Gosh, seriously. Hey, come here.

474
00:29:46,267 --> 00:29:48,267
Wait.

475
00:29:49,033 --> 00:29:50,733
- Wait!
- Sorry for loving you.

476
00:29:50,733 --> 00:29:51,900
- Lloyd!
- What's wrong with you?

477
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,033
Hey. Please stop loving me.

478
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:55,867
No fan of mine is a fraud.

479
00:29:55,867 --> 00:29:58,267
Stop being my fan immediately.

480
00:29:58,267 --> 00:30:00,333
You jerk.

481
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:03,000
Let go of my hand now.

482
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,433
Don't you get what just happened here?

483
00:30:06,433 --> 00:30:09,000
I saved you from almost being conned.

484
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,833
How can I trust someone who bluffs?

485
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,100
If you could treat illness
by drinking random liquid like this,

486
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,100
no one would be sick in this world.

487
00:30:25,433 --> 00:30:28,267
But what if they were telling the truth?

488
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:31,433
What if it really could…

489
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,367
Are you naive or just slow?

490
00:30:41,367 --> 00:30:43,333
Are you usually all over the place?

491
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:45,100
Cut it out.

492
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,667
Or perhaps you're really ill?

493
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,567
Don't worry about me.

494
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:51,900
It's none of your business.

495
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,967
You keep making me…

496
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:57,933
worry about you.

497
00:31:05,967 --> 00:31:08,167
Mind your own business.

498
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:25,200
Comrade Seong…

499
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,967
Jae Hoon?

500
00:31:27,967 --> 00:31:29,900
How have you been?

501
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,167
Nice to see you,

502
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:33,233
