Unauthorized overnight stay
is considered a desertion.

2
00:00:02,733 --> 00:00:04,767
Arrest her.

3
00:00:04,767 --> 00:00:07,100
What do you think you're doing?

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,667
I'm taking Lieutenant with me.

5
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,967
Why are you taking her?

6
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:20,000
Because she's my girl.

7
00:00:38,967 --> 00:00:42,933
You'll be fine without me, right?

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,700
I have no choice, but to figure it out.

9
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:54,300
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,033
Don't apologize.

11
00:00:56,033 --> 00:01:00,033
I'm the one who should
apologize. I'm no help at all.

12
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:04,200
You stayed by my side the entire time.

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,500
That's more than enough.

14
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:11,767
Why don't you

15
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:14,867
take this chance and be with that woman?

16
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,933
You guys look great together.

17
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,633
It's too late now.

18
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:23,967
I don't want

19
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:26,567
to make her suffer more.

20
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:31,600
Do you know

21
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:35,933
what I regret the most in my life?

22
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:39,133
Making the person I love wait.

23
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,933
Don't make us wait too long.

24
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:49,233
Both me and her.

25
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:57,700
This is your home,

26
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,333
so come back any time.

27
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,533
Fine.

28
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:12,300
Lieutenant Baek has the ex post facto
reporting procedures to follow.

29
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,700
Let's drop the issue of desertion
caused by unauthorized overnight stay.

30
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,168
Tell me your whereabouts from
yesterday afternoon to this morning.

31
00:02:19,168 --> 00:02:20,267
The thing is…

32
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:23,733
I told you, she was with me the entire time.

33
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:26,467
Comrade No.

34
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:28,300
This is my strategy, so be quiet.

35
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,600
Even in the middle of the night?

36
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,567
That's nonsense.

37
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:33,867
Yes, we were together all night long.

38
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:35,967
We were never apart, not even for a moment.

39
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:39,200
I'm her alibi and a witness. Does that suffice?

40
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:42,267
But that makes no sense.

41
00:02:42,267 --> 00:02:45,600
There's no reason for you two to be
together all night, don't you think?

42
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,500
Why not?

43
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,767
We're dating.

44
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:53,400
You're dating?

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,467
Comrade, you tell me.

46
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,567
If you tell the truth, I'll consider it
an extenuating circumstance.

47
00:02:57,567 --> 00:02:59,000
Comrade Vice Commissioner.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,600
Why must I tell you about
my whereabouts last night?

49
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,933
Please tell me the reason.

50
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:03,933
This isn't fair.

51
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:08,133
Six of our unit members
were targeted yesterday.

52
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:11,000
But all shots fired hit the bulletproof vests,

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,667
so no one got hurt.

54
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:18,167
There aren't many snipers who can do that.

55
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:20,767
Vice Commissioner Park,
I'm really disappointed in you.

56
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:24,033
How could you doubt
Lieutenant Baek with such logic?

57
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:26,500
Are you a single-celled organism?

58
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:28,600
A single-celled organism?

59
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,167
Watch your mouth.

60
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:33,100
You're digging your own grave.

61
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,333
Come on…

62
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,367
Both of you, please calm down.

63
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:38,133
Please calm down.

64
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:41,167
I suppose you didn't play card games all night.

65
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:42,867
Just tell us what you were doing and where.

66
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:44,700
If that's convincing,

67
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,733
it establishes an alibi, right?

68
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:49,433
But you do know, Vice Commissioner Lee.

69
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:50,433
I do?

70
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:53,300
Where was I last night?

71
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,100
Pyeonghwa Hotel?

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,167
What are you two scheming?

73
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:06,900
I understand that it must
be hard for you to believe.

74
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,833
But I feel so horrified by
the fact that I must disclose

75
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,700
my dating life like this.

76
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,833
Horrified?

77
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,567
You may not be familiar with it
since you're from North Korea.

78
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:18,467
But in South Korea,

79
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,667
it's difficult for a top star like me

80
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:24,300
to reveal that I'm dating someone.

81
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,667
That's why Lieutenant Baek…

82
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:28,700
That's why I had to

83
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,167
keep Yeong Ok a secret.

84
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:32,400
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,733
Because of me…

86
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,600
Is he really telling the truth?

87
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:44,000
Well…

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,100
It's okay.

89
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,933
You don't have to hide in the shadows anymore.

90
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:50,200

91
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,167

your love for me.

93
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:17,333
You punk, you caused such big trouble.

94
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,767
It's you who caused trouble. I handled it.

95
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:21,933
I'm sure there was a better way
to resolve it other than bluffing.

96
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:24,267
What other way?

97
00:05:24,267 --> 00:05:25,900
But still.

98
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,300

99

100

What ridiculous nonsense!

101
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:34,767
I didn't want to say that, either.

102
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:38,167
Is it because you don't want
my help or you don't like to lie?

103
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:39,233
If they find out that we lied,

104
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:41,600
have you thought about what could happen?

105
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,667
As long as you don't mess up,
they will never find out.

106
00:05:47,433 --> 00:05:48,667
Why are you going this far?

107
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,400
Are you asking because you really don't know?

108
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,667
That punk. What on earth is he thinking?

109
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:06,800
I've always thought he was playing with fire,

110
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,333
but he really crossed the line this time.

111
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,567
Do you believe what he said?

112
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:12,433
I'm not a single-celled organism.

113
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:14,867
How could I?

00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,700
Whatever.

184
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,767
Lloyd.

185
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,133
I think we'll be okay.

186
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:16,833
No, actually,

187
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,967
we're saved.

188
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:27,633
[Lloyd protects the country, she
protects him, and we protect her.]

189
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:33,867
By any chance, is this me?

190
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:37,500
Then, I would've destroyed it already.

191
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:39,700
At once.

192
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,467
Please go easy on me, won't you?

193
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:43,367
We're fellow comrades
on the same team, you know?

194
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:46,300
Everyone in North and South
is making a fuss about us.

195
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,467
What on earth are you thinking, Comrade?

196
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:51,200
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.

197
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:53,700
- Unification.
- You startled me, seriously.

198
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,733
What's the matter?

199
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:03,667
Vice Commissioner Park asked
for me, so I went to see him.

200
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,667
And?

201
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,567
Hey, is this for real?

202
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:11,000
Yes, it is.

203
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,700
He called me in discreetly

204
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,833
and asked me to spy on two of you carefully.

205
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,267
Spy on us?

206
00:11:17,267 --> 00:11:21,067
He asked me to monitor you to see
if you're really dating and report to him.

207
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:23,067
Nam Sik.

208
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:26,000
Tell him that you saw the two of us kissing.

209
00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:29,067
How embarrassing.

210
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:30,767
I'll do as you say,

211
00:11:30,767 --> 00:11:34,000
but the problem is that I'm not
the only one he gave the order.

212
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,867
Many people are watching you.

213
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,667
Oh, my God. I need some popcorn to watch this.

214
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:42,233
You mean, corn puff snack?

215
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,433
I'll go bring some.

216
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:48,233
Why did you hit me?

217
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,833
Comrade Gye, I want to know
why you're telling us all this.

218
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,533
To me,

219
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:02,033
it's not important what the truth is.

220
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:07,633
I just don't want Comrade Lieutenant Baek
to be sent back to North Korea

221
00:12:07,633 --> 00:12:13,000
and I support the revolutionary love between
two citizens that goes beyond borders.

222
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,267
Fortunately, this incident

223
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:20,900
got buried by Lloyd's scandal.

224
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,900
Yes, ma'am.

225
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,967
The public is very excited
about the South-North couple.

226
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:28,100
Do you actually believe what that punk said?

227
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,167
Is Lloyd scandal fabricated?

228
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,167
No, ma'am.

229
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:36,100
It began when they were
in the hospital together.

230
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,900
Vice Commissioner Lee, you're
just jumping to conclusions.

231
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,267
Okay, listen.

232
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:45,433
There'll be a peace agreement
ceremony of South and North soon.

233
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:50,500
I ask the two of you to cooperate carefully
to prevent any unsavory situations.

234
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,167
You heard about Lloyd already, right?

235
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:56,767
Someone I want to have.

236
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,233
I still feel the same.

237
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:03,267
Do you want to have him or do you love him?

238
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,233
Both.

239
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:50,067
Please finish your food

240
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:52,667
if you don't want them to find out on day one.

241
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:05,667
It makes it easier if you pretend
everyone's eyes as camera lenses.

242
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:07,933
They'll lose their interests soon
if there isn't anything exciting.

243
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:11,067
I don't have the same state of mind as you.

244
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:18,233
You know that I'm trying to understand
your state of mind right now, right?

245
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,500
The way you acted that day,

246
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,833
no one understands it.

247
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,833
I couldn't make sense of it in my head, either.

248
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,200
Only my heart does.

249
00:14:33,467 --> 00:14:35,833
Enjoy your food.

250
00:14:56,933 --> 00:14:58,933
You've never been on a date before?

251
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:00,400
It's not like we're going on a mission.

252
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,800
Why do we have to

253
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,700
wear our uniforms?

254
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,767
We're going on a mission.

255
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:10,633
In any case, how many people are following us?

256
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:12,367
Three or four, I think?

257
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:15,400
But I think there could be more.

258
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:18,167
Let's start acting.

259
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:24,633
Why are you asking me to ride a bike

260
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:27,200
at a park for no reason?

261
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,867
The thing is

262
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:30,167
that people who are in love

263
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:32,233
ride a bike together at parks.

264
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:38,167
In any case, please don't
mention anything to Mi Rae.

265
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:39,400
Understood?

266
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,833
You still don't know FITA fans very well.

267
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,867
I bet she already knows that we're dating.

268
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:47,933
What's up with your acting?

269
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:55,133
It's been a while since I had fun last time.

270
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:58,567
Let's hold hands first.

271
00:16:03,467 --> 00:16:05,733
Run on the count of three.

272
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:08,400
One, two…

273
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:38,767
Congratulations, you two.
You're Mi Rae's elder sister, right?

274
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:42,267
And you're Mr. Lloyd.

275
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,267
South Korean man and North Korean woman.
They look so good together, right, honey?

276
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:50,533
We're big fans of yours.

277
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:52,533
If we could have your autograph,

278
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:55,400
we'll feel so honored and pass it down
from generation to generation.

279
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,500
Oh, okay.

280
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,967
Of course, I will.

281
00:17:00,633 --> 00:17:04,000
I suppose I'm popular in North Korea too?

282
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,633
I'm not sure about that.

283
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,933
I mean, we're big fans of yours.

284
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:11,967
Oh, I see.

285
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:14,133
Thank you.

286
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:20,167
I hope many South-North and North-South
couples follow suit in Pyeonghwasi.

287
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:23,333
As you know, we're such a fantastic couple.

288
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,733
That's enough.

289
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:28,833
That's how she reacts
when she feels embarrassed.

290
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:31,233
Well, goodbye.

291
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:34,700
- Don't forget this.
- Oh, right.

292
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,233
- Go home safely.
- Thank you. Take care.

293
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:38,367
Please come again.

294
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,133
Don't they remind us of our old days?

295
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:47,033
I hope they become happy like us, right?

296
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,900
I'm sorry.

297
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,000
No worries.

298
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:17,367
So,

299
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:21,100
what a pair of lovely lovebirds.

300
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,333
It's not like that.

301
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,133
You aren't Avon.

302
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:31,033
Mi Rae.

303
00:18:31,033 --> 00:18:33,367
Of course, I'm not Avon.

304
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:35,567
Don't you know who I am?

305
00:18:36,267 --> 00:18:37,600
As for me,

306
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,100
I'm the leader who represents FITA.

307
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,433
I'm Lloyd. Hi.

308
00:18:41,433 --> 00:18:43,033
Oh, my.

309
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:44,567
He isn't that great to begin with,

310
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:48,000
but now that I see him in person,
he isn't even your type.

311
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,033
Don't be silly, Mi Rae.

312
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:52,533
What does your sister like then?

313
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:55,300
Some belly fat like a party officer.

314
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,933
Broad shoulders. Eyes
that resemble wild grapes.

315
00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:00,767
But that's not the trend nowadays.

316
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:02,533
She's totally right.

317
00:19:02,533 --> 00:19:06,367
You have to look as strong as me
to be considered a manly man.

318
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,400
What's up with you guys?

319
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,200
What are you doing here?

320
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,733
We just came to a restaurant
to eat. What's wrong with that?

321
00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:14,867
Hello.

322
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:16,200
Hi, kiddo.

323
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
Hi.

324
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,300
Come on in.

325
00:19:23,433 --> 00:19:25,533
Let's invite the convenience store couple too

326
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:28,200
and have a feast today for
the first time in a long time.

327
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,333
A feast?

328
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,233
Your man is here too,

329
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:36,567
so wouldn't it be sad not to have a feast?

330
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:38,833
It's not like that.

331
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:44,233
If your mother and father were alive,

332
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:46,833
they'd been so happy.

333
00:19:50,233 --> 00:19:51,767
I shouldn't have said that.

334
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:56,200
Go bring a nice bottle of
sesame oil from the room.

335
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,233
Okay.

336
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:21,900
Comrade Seong.

337
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,033
- Makgeolli, cheers.
- Cheers.

338
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,100
But that's not helpful.

339
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,300
Don't listen to him. It's total gibberish.

340
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,000
Listen carefully, okay?

341
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,700
If you do as I say, you could benefit greatly.

342
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,900
So tell me.

343
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,233
How will I know if you don't tell me?

344
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:44,200
We know Comrade Lieutenant Baek quite well.

345
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,233
But we don't think

346
00:20:45,233 --> 00:20:48,033
Comrade No fully won
Comrade Lieutenant Baek's heart.

347
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:50,033
But we're dating.

348
00:20:50,033 --> 00:20:52,033
It's very obvious to us.

349
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:55,900
North Korean women don't act so cold
when they have totally fallen for you.

350
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,633
It's entirely different from being coy.

351
00:20:57,633 --> 00:21:00,267
Even if you're dating already,
if you want to win her heart,

352
00:21:00,267 --> 00:21:02,800
you need a strategy.

353
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,067
Strategy?

354
00:21:04,067 --> 00:21:07,000
Like how? Keep going.

355
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
What did he say?

356
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,567
He's telling you to go.

357
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:10,600
- All of a sudden?
- No.

358
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,967
No, no.

359
00:21:11,967 --> 00:21:14,800
Keep going. Continue what you were saying.

360
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,500
What strategy?

361
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,700
Listen carefully, Comrade.

362
00:21:22,567 --> 00:21:26,933
North Korean women like men
who are strong and as tough as steel.

363
00:21:26,933 --> 00:21:29,367
Show a quick smile.

364
00:21:29,367 --> 00:21:32,400
- Then hit the brick with your head. Bam.
- That's right.

365
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,467
Destroy it.

366
00:21:33,467 --> 00:21:35,533
Break a brick with your head out of nowhere?

367
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:37,267
Hit it hard with your head. Bam.

368
00:21:37,267 --> 00:21:40,000
Lloyd, don't do that.

369
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,833
You must give her a gift.

370
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,633
You're rich, you know?

371
00:21:43,633 --> 00:21:47,200
Get her something that's
most expensive and the best.

372
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,700
- You mean, just buy her a designer bag, right?
- Yes.

373
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,833
Gosh, listen to that
South Korean capitalist punk.

374
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,500
More than money or words,

375
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,567
your heart matters the most.

376
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,467
That's what I'm talking about, man.

377
00:21:59,467 --> 00:22:03,200
Hey, heart?

378
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,033
A heart that's as fickle as the wind?
It changes instantly when there's no money.

379
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:08,533
Yes, that's right.

380
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:09,933
Be quiet.

381
00:22:09,933 --> 00:22:11,333
Aren't you guys all single?

382
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,967
Is anyone dating at the moment?

383
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:17,000
You're crossing the line.

384
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:24,367
These are your and Mi Rae's passports.

385
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:26,100
We'll go to China first

386
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,400
and catch a flight to the US.

387
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,933
We don't need these.

388
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:36,267
What are you talking about?

389
00:22:36,267 --> 00:22:38,333
You saved my life. This is nothing.

390
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:41,567
I just paid you back for
what I owed you ten years ago.

391
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:44,667
Ten years ago?

392
00:22:45,433 --> 00:22:47,433
If it weren't for you, Comrade Jae Hoon,

393
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:50,967
I wouldn't be alive now.

394
00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:56,200
What about Mi Rae then?

395
00:22:57,433 --> 00:22:59,967
You know me, don't you?

396
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:04,400
I must get surgery for Mi Rae on my own.

397
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,667
I promised her.

398
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,500
I can't even ask you to come with me then.

399
00:23:27,267 --> 00:23:30,067
Do you even want to leave?

400
00:23:43,367 --> 00:23:45,700
From now on,

401
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:48,533
I hope

402
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:51,733
we don't meet ever again.

403
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,467
I really mean it.

404
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:16,167
We're going to meet again for sure.

405
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,133
That must be our fate.

406
00:24:36,867 --> 00:24:39,500
Wow! That was amazing.

407
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:37,267
This is so great.

408
00:25:37,267 --> 00:25:39,167
Where are we?

409
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:41,833
This isn't our rooftop, is it?

410
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:44,000
Tell me about it.

411
00:25:44,733 --> 00:25:46,700
You said you'd let us have
a date alone. What happened?

412
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,633
There are paparazzi everywhere.

413
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:52,167
Therefore…

414
00:25:53,233 --> 00:25:55,400
We prepared this.

415
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:59,733
Peace beach in peace city.

416
00:26:21,567 --> 00:26:25,467
Why are you so excited
joining someone else's date?

417
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,667
Seriously.

418
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,800
Isn't it good?

419
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,967
It's nicely grilled.

420
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,700
Love you more!

421
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:58,867
I'll not let you slide. Just you wait!

422
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:18,033
Hey, don't come over here.

423
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:48,033
Okay, come on in.

424
00:27:58,733 --> 00:28:01,700
Everyone worked hard today.

425
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,800
I got to see Yeong Ok smile
for the first time in a long time.

426
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,567
It was so great to see Mi Rae so happy.

427
00:28:09,933 --> 00:28:14,767
Do I resemble your son a lot?

428
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:21,267
If I hadn't let go of
that little hand back then

429
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,533
and if he grew up by my side, I would think so.

430
00:28:32,967 --> 00:28:38,833
Any unique characteristics
that you can recognize him by?

431
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:44,900
On his elbow, he has
a burn scar that looks like

432
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,500
the map of the Korean Peninsula.

433
00:28:50,033 --> 00:28:52,467
That was my fault too.

434
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:57,800
If I hadn't taken my eyes off him…

435
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:19,833
We prepared a heartfelt gift for you two.

436
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:23,300
It's okay. Soldiers don't get paid much.

437
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,100
Why do you keep putting us together?

438
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,200
I don't know what the gift is,

439
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,567
but I'll treat you with ten times
the amount that you spent today.

440
00:29:30,567 --> 00:29:33,233
But don't you think they are very thoughtful?

441
00:29:33,233 --> 00:29:36,700
We hope you're happy together for a long time.

442
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,033
Ta-da.

443
00:29:39,033 --> 00:29:41,233
- Look.
- Surprise.

444
00:29:41,233 --> 00:29:43,233
I picked it out.

445
00:29:43,233 --> 00:29:46,933
Why did you pick that? I hate it.

446
00:29:46,933 --> 00:29:51,733
What is that? You guys wear it.
Matching shirts are so last season.

447
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,533
They look lovely.

448
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,867
Please stop.

449
00:30:29,867 --> 00:30:32,067
Here you go.

450
00:30:48,067 --> 00:30:50,467
Do you have feelings for me?

451
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,867
I knew you're blunt,

452
00:30:57,867 --> 00:31:01,933
but how could you change the tempo
from ballad to EDM so abruptly?

453
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:05,167
BPM is just way too fast.

454
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:07,600
Don't like me.

455
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:14,033
We should've never met from the start.

456
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:16,233
Why?

457
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,067
Are you asking because you really don't know?

458
00:31:22,067 --> 00:31:24,700
Because we're too different?

459
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:29,500
But isn't this Pyeonghwasi
where North and South unite?

460
00:31:30,633 --> 00:31:33,200
That's a separate issue.

461
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:37,267
You sacrificed too much.

462
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,833
I'll always be grateful for what you've done.

463
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:46,233
Are my feelings one-sided?

464
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,900
I like you too.

465
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,033
But it must end here.

466
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,733
After today, forget everything.

467
00:32:09,733 --> 00:32:12,067
I'll do the same.

468
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:16,000
You care about me so much

469
00:32:16,633 --> 00:32:19,467
to the point that you want to forget about me?

470
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,067
After today…

471
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,967
We could've slept more, don't you think?

472
00:33:16,967 --> 00:33:19,567
Do you all want to end up at a coal mine?

473
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:21,433
Go back in now and sleep.

474
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:24,067
Unification.

475
00:33:24,867 --> 00:33:28,133
What's a coal mine? A coal mine…

476
00:33:33,033 --> 00:33:36,133
What's a coal mine?

477
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:46,767
Why do you keep following me?

478
00:33:46,767 --> 00:33:50,467
You usually end a date
by walking the girl home.

479
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:52,433
But this is a dorm.

480
00:33:52,433 --> 00:33:53,800
Go now.

481
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,467
I'll watch you go inside first.

482
00:34:03,767 --> 00:34:05,833
What's wrong?

483
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:37,633
What's going on?

484
00:34:37,633 --> 00:34:40,033
What?

485
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,833
Tell me.

486
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:50,300
Wiretap.

487
00:34:50,933 --> 00:34:52,967
Wire--

488
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,600
[Wiretap]

489
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:36,400
I know these punks are in love, but still,

490
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,267
what on earth are they doing
on the military compound?

491
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:06,267
You should've been an actor, not a singer.

492
00:36:06,267 --> 00:36:08,033
I had many roles offered to me,

493
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:09,100
but because of my musical ambition--

494
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,000
Shut your mouth.

495
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,733
Go back now.

496
00:36:12,733 --> 00:36:16,167
Fine, I'm going.

497
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:22,133
But I've got to do something before I go.

498
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:45,533
♫ I'm clumsy and awkward ♫

499
00:36:45,533 --> 00:36:50,167
♫ But I try to act like it's nothing ♫

500
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:52,900
♫ As a day goes by ♫

501
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,767
♫ And another month goes by ♫

502
00:36:55,767 --> 00:36:57,900
♫ Will I be ♫

503
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,533
♫ A little closer to you then ♫

504
00:37:01,533 --> 00:37:03,800
♫ You and me ♫

505
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,233
♫ So special ♫

506
00:37:06,233 --> 00:37:08,167
♫ Love my hurt ♫

507
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:09,833
♫ Only for you ♫

508
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:12,133
♫ I wish for you ♫

509
00:37:12,133 --> 00:37:15,000
♫ I was hoping for romance ♫

510
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,667
♫ A heart-pounding day ♫
