1
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:03,067
Don't be mistaken

2
00:00:03,067 --> 00:00:05,467
thinking that you know me so well.

3
00:00:06,467 --> 00:00:08,833
I doubt you have any idea

4
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:11,767
what kind of a person I am.

5
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:15,700
I was wrong about you.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,967
I really have no single idea

7
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:19,533
what kind of a person you are, Lieutenant Baek.

8
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:21,833
I don't even want to know anymore. But

9
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:25,133
I do want to know what happened to Song I.

10
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:29,833
You should mind your own business.

11
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:32,700
No, I must know.

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,500
Say it now. Say it.

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,800
I said, "say it!"

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,100
Please hold yourself back, Lieutenant Baek.

15
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,367
That comrade is quite awful,
but please just let it go.

16
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:46,167
Enough is enough. How dare
you disrespect your superior!

17
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:48,733
Lloyd, you can get
locked up for this, you idiot.

18
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:51,100
Say you're sorry, man.

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,800
Why don't you just take this?

20
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:28,767
I was wrong about you.

21
00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:31,267
I really have no single idea

22
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:33,367
what kind of a person you are, Lieutenant Baek.

23
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:36,133
I don't even want to know anymore.

24
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,467
Relax, man.

25
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:45,633
Tell me what happened, Lloyd. What's going on?

26
00:01:45,633 --> 00:01:47,767
Lloyd, I knew that

27
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:49,833
you'd get beaten up one day
by Comrade Lieutenant Baek.

28
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:52,200
You aren't any better than her.

29
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,267
How long have you known
about the latest mission?

30
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:56,733
Before the filming?

31
00:01:56,733 --> 00:01:59,300
What do you mean, you were the only one
who didn't know about it? Why would that be?

32
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,167
You said we're fellow soldiers.

33
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:02,600
You said we're on the same team!

34
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,033
Comrade No, we had no idea

35
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:06,500
that you didn't know about it.

36
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,200
We sure thought that you
knew about the mission.

37
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,967
It'd be odd that you were the only
one who didn't know about it.

38
00:02:10,967 --> 00:02:13,067
Don't you think so?

39
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,033
You're going to get locked up.

40
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:32,267
It's Han Song I's jacket
found in Comrade No's locker.

41
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:35,100
I didn't find anything noteworthy.

42
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:42,433
You may go.

43
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:45,567
Unification.

44
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:47,167
I'll give you a holiday pass.

45
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,767
Go rest up for a few days.

46
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:52,700
I have the guard duty for the upcoming event--

47
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,767
I said, rest up.

48
00:02:58,467 --> 00:03:01,000
Thank you, Comrade Vice Commissioner.

49
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,267
Hello, Yeon Gyeong? It's me, Lloyd.

50
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,167
My goodness. You're finally answering my call.

51
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,833
You ignored my text message too.

52
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,533
I'm not doing it.

53
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:36,667
But you can't say no before hearing me out.

54
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:39,400
Whenever you called me, it was never
good news, Vice Commissioner Lee.

55
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,100
This time, it's good news.

56
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,700
It's a party. A special garden party.

57
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,800
No, thanks.

58
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,067
It's the mayor's order.

59
00:03:49,067 --> 00:03:51,500
You must attend.

60
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,533
I'm not interested.

61
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:55,867
Wait.

62
00:03:55,867 --> 00:03:57,467
Quality information, quality information.

63
00:03:57,467 --> 00:04:00,067
There will be guerrilla training soon.

64
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:01,167
It'll be very rigorous.

65
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:02,600
I'm hanging up now.

66
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,833
Guerrilla training…

67
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:09,167
But guerrilla training is really rigorous.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,167
Then, right before the peace treaty,

69
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:17,900
they were all named warriors. Is that right?

70
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,600
Because they were dispatched to the South
concealing their social class from the start,

71
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,767
the Republic gave them social status
and compensation thereafter.

72
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,067
I see.

73
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:30,800
Is everything well with Comrade Director?

74
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,167
Yes, my father is well.

75
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:37,033
Sorry to bother him with a trivial
request when he's so busy.

76
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:38,067
No worries at all, ma'am.

77
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:39,630
You may go.

78
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,950
Unification.

79
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,080

Timing and Subtitles brought to you by 
 Our Hearts as One ❤️ Team@Viki.com 

81
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,033
I've been looking for you everywhere.

82
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:08,633
You have time for that?

83
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:10,033
Don't you have guerrilla training soon?

84
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:12,700
I'm in great shape. Please don't worry.

85
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:17,100
You must survive on your own
at this guerrilla training.

86
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,400
If you fail, you die.

87
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,367
Don't you know why I came back here?

88
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:21,933
It's because of Song I.

89
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:23,400
Stop leaving me out of things

90
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,200
and cooperate.

91
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,067
Must I repeat myself?

92
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:28,100
It's none of your business.

93
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,800
Complete your military duty diligently

94
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,367
and get discharged.

95
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:32,767
Okay, okay.

96
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:35,000
If that's how you're going to be,

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,267
I'll just figure it out on my own.

98
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:40,767
Figure what out on your own?

99
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:43,333
I can think for myself.

100
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:50,633
Don't bother thinking.

101
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,133
If you behave flippantly,

102
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:55,067
I'll not let it slide then.

103
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:57,800
Not let it slide? What can you do anyway?

104
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,233
Going forward, you won't be allowed

105
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:04,267
to leave or stay out overnight.

106
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,067
Got that?

107
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:07,800
That's too harsh.

108
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,900
But…

109
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,890
­

110
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:24,267
Hello?

111
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:26,000
Attorney Seo Hee Ji?

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,200
Wait.

113
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,367
Didn't we agree to be friends?

114
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:31,200
Oh, right.

115
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,767
We're friends.

116
00:06:34,767 --> 00:06:36,567
You agreed too easily.

117
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:39,567
It seems like you have a favor to ask.

118
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:43,867
Were you able to find out
anything about Han Song I?

119
00:06:43,867 --> 00:06:46,533
I want to be the first one to know.

120
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:48,800
There isn't much information in the South.

121
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,300
Other than the fact
that she's a big fan of FITA.

122
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,500
Pyeonghwasi's security is on the line.

123
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,367
And it really seems like
she has ties to North Korea.

124
00:06:57,367 --> 00:07:01,233
The key thing is there's
information that she's a hacker.

125
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:02,467
A hacker?

126
00:07:02,467 --> 00:07:03,700
Anything else?

127
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,267
At this point, it should be "give and take."

128
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:08,667
Do me a favor too.

129
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:11,267
A South Korean conglomerate is hosting

130
00:07:11,267 --> 00:07:14,400
and Pyeonghwasi is supporting
this fundraising party.

131
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,367
Will you attend it as my partner?

132
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:20,600
I'm sorry, but I don't want to go to that.

133
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,733
You don't want to go?

134
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,733
But I have another important
piece of information.

135
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:26,900
No, I don't want to…

136
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,467
Important information?

137
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:33,733
Where are you going?

138
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,100
You sister is coming.

139
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,300
I'll be right back.

140
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,200
I heard someone's giving out free gifts.

141
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,833
Don't go too far, okay?

142
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,133
Okay.

143
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:44,367
Don't run!

144
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:23,367
Are you okay?

145
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:26,633
Yes, I'm fine.

146
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,967
Here.

147
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:34,133
Are you heading to the store?

148
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:36,367
Yes. Why?

149
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:39,267
Well, my sister said she was coming,

150
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:43,067
but I'm not familiar with
the streets, so I'm really late.

151
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:45,033
Then she must be worried.

152
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:47,233
Should we head over together?

153
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:11,667
Mi Rae.

154
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:13,600
Where have you been?

155
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,633
I was worried.

156
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:18,333
Sis.

157
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,067
Don't scold her too harshly.

158
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:22,667
I think she got lost trying to get back.

159
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:30,700
Don't go out by yourself again.

160
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,700
Understood?

161
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,067
You got lucky.

162
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:40,933
You ran into me, so you didn't get lost,

163
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:43,433
and you got a nice gift too.

164
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:46,567
Thank you, Comrade Seong.

165
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:49,167
Come on. Don't call me, "Comrade Seong."

166
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:52,333
Just call me by my name from now on.

167
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,033
That's how they all refer to
each other in South Korea.

168
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:01,000
Bye, Mi Rae.

169
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:08,267
Let's go.

170
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:10,867
Don't go around by yourself again, okay?

171
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,567
There you go. All finished.

172
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:19,167
You need to take your medicine now.

173
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:21,333
It doesn't taste good.

174
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,900
You don't take medicine for its taste.

175
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,900
Don't make me worry and just take it, okay?

176
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,533
"Don't run. Eat slowly."

177
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:28,967
"Don't skip your medicine."

178
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:32,400
Did I nag that much?

179
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:49,067
Your hand looks just like Mother's.

180
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:51,833
Your hands take after Mother's.

181
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,033
I take after Father.

182
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:56,033
Mi Rae, when you grow up,

183
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:58,100
you're going to become
such a beauty like Mother.

184

- Really?
- Yes.

185
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,500
So take good care of yourself
until you get surgery, okay?

186
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,233
And don't get into trouble.

187
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:09,300
Gosh, you're nagging again.

188
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,833
So just tell me exactly what that is.

189
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,133
You'll be in danger if you hold on to that.

190
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,333
No, actually,

191
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,100
I need to make sure you don't have it

192
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,233
to ensure your safety.

193
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:27,667
I'm about to go insane. Seriously.

194

What's this?

195
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,067
Is something wrong with Mi Rae?

196
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:08,800
Her heart

197
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,933
has some issues.

198
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,567
Have a quick drink and sleep tight.

199
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:18,333
If you worry too much,

200
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,333
you'll grow old.

201
00:13:21,533 --> 00:13:22,633
Comrade Jae Hoon.

202
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:24,800
Call me Jae Hoon.

203
00:13:26,267 --> 00:13:28,533
Is that the right name?

204
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:33,233
Weren't you, along with
your name, reported dead?

205
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,900
So you knew already.

206
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:44,133
Seong Jae Hoon of the Republic did die.

207
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:46,600
The person who is here now

208
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,400
is Lee Jae Hoon, the bartender of Uno Pub.

209
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,500
This one thought came to mind after
being on the verge of death numerous times.

210
00:14:00,267 --> 00:14:02,200
"For once,"

211
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,833
"I want to live an ordinary life
like everyone else."

212
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,933
You've never thought that way?

213
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,600
You need to eat a lot to be healthy.

214
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,767
Try this too.

215
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:21,933

216
00:14:21,933 --> 00:14:24,667
Which one is prettier?

217
00:14:25,267 --> 00:14:26,667
They're both pretty.

218
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,233
Are you going somewhere nice?

219

The old man from Uno Pub

220
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:32,767
and I were invited to an event
for the separated families.

221
00:14:32,767 --> 00:14:35,233
I heard that many high-ranking officers
of Pyeonghwasi will be there too,

222
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:39,467
so I plan to ask them
to grant all our requests.

223
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:40,700
Is that right?

224
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,500
Then I'll call a taxi for you.

225
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,067
You can ride it there with Mr. Seok.

226
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:45,967
The owner of Uno Pub was invited too,

227
00:14:45,967 --> 00:14:48,633

of you while you're in the military.

232
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,567
- Hey.
- It stinks here.

233
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:04,900
I have a question.

234
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,667
When I joined the military, I heard
someone at the company was so excited

235
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:11,567
that he or she even clapped.
Do you know who that was?

236
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm so happy that I even cancelled
my vacation to be with you.

237
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,867
Do you have any desire to re-enlist
with the Unified Armed Force Unit?

238
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:22,267
You can even eat chocolate here.

239
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:28,000
Lloyd, there's a more urgent task here.

240
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
A Carlini suit is a must.

241
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,200

Aren't we combatting separately on our own?

248
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,500

you aren't allowed to leave.

[Leave Pass]

251
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:17,367
I told them that I don't want to go
to a formal, fundraising party.

00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:20,167
But the people at the top

253
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:21,700
insisted that I attend as a VIP.

254
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,900
That's why I'm going.

255
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,867
The unit members all went in security
vehicles. Why don't you come with me?

256
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:27,967
I'm not interested.

257
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:29,300
It's not that you're not interested,

258
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,000
but perhaps you've been
excluded from the guard duty.

259
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,533
Don't you know me well? That's not the case.

260
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:38,100
How would I know what kind
of a person you are, Lieutenant Baek?

261
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,833
It's not like we were close.

262
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,000
I didn't complain, but frankly speaking,

263
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,600
whenever we ran into each other,
terrible things happened.

264
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,933

00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,300

mistakenly think you're concerned about me.

00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:33,133
Okay, if this couple wins the game,

365
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,733
no less than 100 million won will be donated.

366
00:26:35,733 --> 00:26:37,400
- Yes, that's right.
- 100 million won?

367
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,467
It's 100 million won.

368
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:39,867
Isn't that amazing?

369
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:41,300
It's by an anonymous sponsor.

370
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:45,533
Lloyd, the lead dancer
and the lead singer of FITA,

371
00:26:45,533 --> 00:26:49,900
requested the donation to be made to establish
a children's heart foundation in Pyeonghwasi.

372
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,400
Is that correct?

373
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,300
Yes, it is.

374
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,233
Of course, in order to donate,
you must complete this successfully.

375
00:26:56,233 --> 00:26:57,933
Okay.

376
00:26:57,933 --> 00:27:00,533
Please come on the stage.

377
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,767
If you're ready, we'll get started.

378
00:27:11,767 --> 00:27:15,100
Please take a deep breath. Let's start it

379
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,367
with a loud cheer.

380
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:19,167
Please go for it whenever you're ready.

381
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,800
Put me down now.

382
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,300
I don't want to.

383
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,900
It's 100 million won to establish
a children's heart foundation.

384
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,467
A children's heart foundation?

385
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:34,867
This isn't a fraud, so don't worry.

386
00:27:34,867 --> 00:27:36,967
Okay, your hand.

387
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:38,000
My hand?

388
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,233
You have to put your arm around me
in order for me to balance myself.

389
00:27:40,233 --> 00:27:41,600
Do it now.

390
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,267
Hurry.

391
00:27:43,267 --> 00:27:45,267
Here we go.

392
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:10,767
Successful! Amazing!

393
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:12,333
Okay, Lloyd, who is as tough as steel.

394
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:14,033
With his strong willpower,

395
00:28:14,033 --> 00:28:17,467
he's able to donate 100 million won
to the children's heart foundation.

396
00:28:17,467 --> 00:28:20,033
That was amazing. Congratulations!

397
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,033
Can I ask you a question?

398
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:48,600
What's your hometown?

399
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,833
Well…

400
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:51,433
Wait. The owner of the Michelin restaurant?

401
00:28:51,433 --> 00:28:53,867
Hello.

402
00:28:53,867 --> 00:28:56,000
I grew up in Seoul.

403
00:28:57,867 --> 00:28:59,667
Your entire life?

404
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:02,000
Yes, my entire life.

405
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,233
I was born in Masan

406
00:29:03,233 --> 00:29:04,867
and grew up in LA. When I was in LA--

407
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:08,900
You really aren't from North Korea?

408
00:29:09,567 --> 00:29:11,600
No.

409
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,200
This is the last time.

410
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,833
Shadow?

411
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:59,133
I ran out of patience a long time ago.

412
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:01,733
Don't expect any more chances.

413
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,067
Two weeks.

414
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:06,100
There will be an agreement ceremony
between two Number Ones

415
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,600
for both North and South to go in
and out of Pyeonghwasi freely.

416
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,200
If you miss that timing,

417
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,767
that will be your end. Don't you forget.

418
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,300
It must be hard for you, Comrade No.

419
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,167
You're always in the center of attention
and have to endure any criticism.

420
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:29,933
You only realized that now?

421
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,900
But what can I do?

422
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:37,700
My fans say that I'm an idol star
who may come out once in a century.

423
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,967
I accept it as my fate.

424
00:30:48,367 --> 00:30:51,400
How pretty.

425
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,800
You look so pretty today.

426
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,400
Don't bluff.

427
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,433
I wasn't bluffing.

428
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,333
Please excuse us for a moment.

429
00:31:26,433 --> 00:31:28,167
Darn it.

430
00:31:28,167 --> 00:31:30,467
That guy is so rude.

431
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:31,933
- Look, man.
- Lloyd.

432
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:33,300
The mayor is looking for you. Come at once.

433
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,233
The mayor? What now?

434
00:31:35,233 --> 00:31:37,200
The speech.

435
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,333
You were sitting in the van again, weren't you?

436
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:40,367
Where have you been?

437
00:31:45,167 --> 00:31:48,033
They sure are pretty, but they don't suit you.

438
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,767
You're right.

439
00:31:51,767 --> 00:31:53,433
Why do women of South Korea

440
00:31:53,433 --> 00:31:57,033
wear such strangely-shaped
sandals like these? I don't get it.

441
00:31:57,033 --> 00:32:00,433
People on the other side
aren't like you and me.

442
00:32:00,433 --> 00:32:02,433
Be careful.

443
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,033
Don't you worry.

444
00:32:07,033 --> 00:32:09,533
There are only two groups of people.

445
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,400
Either enemies or comrades.

446
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,867
Targets and nontargets.

447
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:17,833
Which one am I?

448
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,867
Pyeonghwasi has become

449
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,700
very special to me now.

450
00:33:24,533 --> 00:33:25,833
♫ Believe that you will return ♫

451
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:27,533
♫ Whatever it is, I believe in you ♫

452
00:33:27,533 --> 00:33:28,900
♫ I can't find you anymore ♫

453
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,433
♫ I believe in our hearts in those days ♫

454
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:34,267
♫ Even though it may be foolish
to turn around ♫

455
00:33:34,267 --> 00:33:35,933
♫ Back to that time on my way ♫

456
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:38,133
♫ How are you doing? Goodbye ♫

457
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:41,433
♫ Who will understand my feelings?
Oh, my heart ♫

458
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:45,333
♫ Only you can know. No, my heart ♫

459
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:47,867
♫ I can't be with you no more ♫

460
00:33:47,867 --> 00:33:49,533
♫ A little more, a little more ♫

461
00:33:49,533 --> 00:33:51,500
♫ I'm getting closer to you ♫

462
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,333
♫ Don't look back and don't hesitate ♫

463
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,967
♫ This day won't come again ♫

464
00:33:56,967 --> 00:33:58,067
♫ Tonight ♫

465
00:33:58,067 --> 00:34:00,567
♫ Don't turn away ♫
