I'll just go play video games.

356
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,933
Lloyd. Lloyd.

357
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,160
...

358
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:28,800
Given the situation,
should I just go out with Jini Yoon for real?

359
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,733
What?

360
00:23:29,733 --> 00:23:32,300
Lloyd, don't even joke about
doing such a thing.

361
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,800
I heard that tabloids are yapping lately

362
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,100
about how I've never had a girlfriend
and that something must be wrong with me.

363
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,633
That's because you're so cold to women

364
00:23:39,633 --> 00:23:41,800
and you're the only member
who has never been involved in a scandal.

365
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,933
You're right, Jeong Man.

366
00:23:42,933 --> 00:23:45,267
Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish,
and Margot Robbie.

367
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:47,567
Even when someone like that tries to hit on me,
I don't even flinch, you know?

368
00:23:47,567 --> 00:23:49,467
- Of course, I do.
- But Jini Yoon

369
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:51,733
caused damage to my career.

370
00:23:51,733 --> 00:23:52,867
Lloyd, calm down. Calm down.

371
00:23:52,867 --> 00:23:54,133
You have to maintain your composure
in a situation like this.

372
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:56,533
In my opinion, Jini Yoon is a tough cookie.

373
00:23:56,533 --> 00:23:59,033
It's suspicious how the reporters
appeared out of nowhere.

374
00:23:59,033 --> 00:24:00,767
Forget it.

375
00:24:02,767 --> 00:24:04,733
Even if the world ends tomorrow,

376
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:07,200
I'll die playing video games.

[HK416 Killer Ginkgo]

380
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:37,133
I almost had it.

381
00:24:58,133 --> 00:25:00,200
Didn't I say I'd follow you
even to the gates of hell?

382
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,967
I worked so hard to get that gun.
How dare you destroyed it!

383
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,433
If I catch you, you're dead meat.

384
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,233
No!

385
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,567
What did I just witness?

386
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,967
Two minutes until the grand finale.

387
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,733
Hey! Jeong Man.

388
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:27,467
Back up. Back up.

389
00:26:27,467 --> 00:26:30,267
I saw a real human weapon. I'm serious.

390
00:26:30,267 --> 00:26:31,800
- Back up.
- No.

391
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,100
I can't do that even if
you met your dream girl!

392
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,133
You have to be there for the grand finale.

393
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:46,533
Aren't the South Korean punks
practically mentally ill?

394
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:47,967
They follow around damn singers

395
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:50,200
and waste their time and money.

396
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,300
If they're still bored, they make prank calls.

397
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,567
It doesn't seem like it was a mere prank call.

398
00:26:57,567 --> 00:26:59,933
What do you mean?

399
00:27:03,467 --> 00:27:05,467
I found this, sir.

400
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:08,633
Isn't this a detonator?

401
00:27:08,633 --> 00:27:11,133
I thought hard about it, but Violet…

402
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:13,300
Don't make a big deal out of it!

403
00:27:16,967 --> 00:27:18,367
But

404
00:27:18,367 --> 00:27:19,800
we should reinvestigate this commotion…

405
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,267
What? Do you have something else to say?

406
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,200
No, sir.

407
00:27:27,467 --> 00:27:31,033
I'll look into this matter separately,

408
00:27:31,033 --> 00:27:34,600
so keep your mouth shut, Comrade Baek.
Got that?

409
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,033
Understood, Comrade Vice Commissioner.

410
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:20,300
Did you forget my order
to disappear without a trace?

411
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,467
I'm sorry, sir.

412
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,367
Our operation has been compromised.

413
00:28:33,367 --> 00:28:35,433
Find the informant.

414
00:28:36,067 --> 00:28:38,033
Yes, sir.

415
00:28:49,633 --> 00:28:53,100
Follow me. Follow me. You die if you do that.

Gosh, come here.

417
00:29:02,433 --> 00:29:03,667
Just follow me… Gosh.

00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:06,533
Gosh, that stings. Protect me.

419
00:29:06,533 --> 00:29:08,633
I'm going to die. That stings.

420
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,300
Darn it. Why didn't they help me?

421
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,000
If they want to win, they need to protect me.
They're so frustrating.

Gosh, what now? I'm lying low!

Don't you read the comments at all?

426
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,233
I don't have time for that. I'm so busy.

427
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,300
You should go.

428
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:37,167
You told me to lie low. Go where?

429
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:40,000
The military.

430
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,767
What? The military?

It'll be three weeks as of tomorrow.

433
00:30:23,733 --> 00:30:27,900
You said you'd find a way at all costs
as long as I finish my training.

434
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,467
But you said before

435
00:30:29,467 --> 00:30:32,800
that you'd be cool and join the Marine Corps,
and complete the entire term.

436
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,567
I didn't realize that it'd be so tough.
I'm suffering so much. Seriously.

437
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:38,667
Hang in there just a little longer.

438
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:40,867
Then what? Would you have a solution then?

439
00:30:40,867 --> 00:30:43,800
I'm sure they'll assign you
to the Defense PR Support Unit.
