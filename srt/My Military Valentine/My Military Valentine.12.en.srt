00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,767
You can find them, right, Lieutenant Baek?

3
00:00:47,267 --> 00:00:49,167
They shoot from the highest point.

4
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:51,567
Even I'm aware of that.

5
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,433
Let's stop now.

6
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:13,633
Put that gun down, Seung Tae.

7
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,733
Nothing's going to change even if you kill him.

8
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:20,433
I'm just following orders.

9
00:01:20,967 --> 00:01:23,533
We're not soldiers.

10
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,300
Have you forgotten?

11
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,267
How did our comrades die?

12
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:49,800
It was my fault.

13
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,400
I couldn't protect them

14
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,733
and I was foolish.

15
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:00,800
Right.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,700
You can't carry out a great task
when you have a woman you love.

17
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,333
If you get in my way again,

18
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,900
you'll be killed.

19
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:19,633
Oh Seung Tae!

20
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:25,167
Seung Tae.

21
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,633
"A gun isn't a toy."

22
00:03:10,633 --> 00:03:12,800
"Fire first if you don't want to die."

23
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,300
You told me that.

24
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,533
We meet again here.

25
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:30,667
We said, let's not meet again.

26
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,367
Yes.

27
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:37,400
Because we were always unhappy
whenever we were together.

28
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,933
So, go now.

29
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,133
But

30
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:45,700
I was happy because of you.

31
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:52,933
Please take good care of Yeong Ok,

32
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:55,000
buddy.

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,533
You're so annoying from
the beginning to the end.

34
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:59,667
Do you know that?

35
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:04,867
As for Seung Tae, I will…

36
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,700
Wake up.

37
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,233
Wake up.

38
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:33,533
Wake up!

39
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:38,200
You even survived that hellish 112 Unit.

40
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,370
You can't just die like this.

Upon hearing that we were going
to hide the target in a safe house,

60
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,200
the first one to bite the bait will be Shadow.

61
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,333
But an unexpected event took place.

62
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:37,033
So more time and effort
were needed accordingly.

63
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:49,467
If it's the safest to hide
the real one among fake ones,

64
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,000
as for the thief who is
trying to steal the real one,

65
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,500
where would he be to have
the highest chance of success?

66
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,200
The guard who is protecting
the real one is the culprit.

67
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:38,100
Send them all out.

68
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,567
- Pardon?
- What's going on?

69
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,933
They're plotting something.

70
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:46,567
They're plotting to kill me.

71
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,533
Are you all right?

72
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:09,133
We must catch Shadow.

73
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:12,367
For Comrade Jae Hoon.

74
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,333
It's for all of us too.

75
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:29,133
Okay, all of you, get out.

76
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,800

77
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,433
Mayor Won, what do you mean
they're plotting something?

78
00:08:39,433 --> 00:08:42,933
You're aware that someone
tried to assassinate Lloyd, right?

79
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:44,967
Yes.

80
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:47,900
It wasn't Violet's doing.

81
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,033
Then, who…

82
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:54,900
North Korea tried to kill
Lloyd as well as me, the mayor,

83
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,233
to destroy Pyeonghwasi's
security and its existence.

84
00:08:58,233 --> 00:09:01,967
- It was North Korea's special operations.
- What did you say?

85
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:03,700
Comrade Won Tae Sook.

86
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,533
- Drop your gun.
- You drop it first, Comrade.

87
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:06,800
Drop the gun now!

88
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,367
You drop it first!

89
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:10,333
Drop it!

90
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:22,133
The security team…

91
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:24,600
It doesn't work? Then, we need to break it.

92
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:28,900
It's bulletproof glass, so we could get hurt.

93
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:35,367
Vice Commissioner Lee, open the door.

94
00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:38,267
Open the door, Vice Commissioner Lee!

95
00:09:38,267 --> 00:09:42,333
Vice Commissioner Lee! Open the door now!

96
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:49,600
It's Baek Yeong Ok.

97
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,867
Baek Yeong Ok is framing me as Shadow

98
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:54,633
and is trying to turn Pyeonghwasi upside down.

99
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:56,433
She's a spy sent by North Korea.

100
00:09:56,433 --> 00:09:59,667
Have you lost your mind? What are you saying?

101
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:02,167
How do you plan to handle all this?

102
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,767
Open the door now, Mayor Won.

103
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,667
Or should I call you Shadow now?

104
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,033
From the start, when my car
without the GPS changed the route,

105
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,533
you were the one who was able
to inform the sniper about this.

106
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:24,600
You were hiding right next to the target.
You are Shadow, Mayor Won Tae Sook.

107
00:10:25,867 --> 00:10:28,200
Now, everything makes sense.

108
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,267
Making sense, my foot.

109
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:33,067
This is all North Korea's doing.

110
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:34,367
It is not.

111
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,567
What can I do to make you trust me?

112
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:38,633
You have to convince me
that you're trustworthy.

113
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:41,200
Do you all want to die together?

114
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:48,800
Now, we're

115
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,167
on the same side.

116
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:01,867
Fine.

117
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,533
Why did you do that?

118
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:31,067
Were you trying to start a war in Pyeonghwasi?

119
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:33,200
Won Tae Sook.

120
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,167
You're under arrest for violating
the unification security law.

121
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,200
Arrest her.

122
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:52,100
Freeze!

123
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:54,800
Drop your gun!

124
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,400
You don't know anything.

125
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:01,833
They say, a hero is always
an embodiment of turbulence.

126
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,767
Peace? Reconciliation?

127
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:06,833
Those things don't suit me.

128
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,600
The country's chaos and
heightened security concerns

129
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,967
made me who I am today.

130
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:13,600
That's the power that sustains me.

131
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,733
I don't

132
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:17,733
want to lose that power.

133
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:19,967
Put that gun down.

134
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:22,433
It's over now.

135
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:25,100
I started it,

136
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,133
so I'll end it too.

137
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:29,033
To become who I am today,

138
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:32,133
do you even know how many
sacrifices I had to make?

139
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:34,733
Sacrifices, my foot.

140
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:39,333
Do you really think

141
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,867
that you've become a hero
of Pyeonghwasi? Seriously?

142
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:45,033
Sorry to break it to you,

143
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:48,467
but hero is someone else, not me.

144
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:51,467
Lieutenant Baek, go ahead and shoot.

145
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:53,833
I trust you, Lieutenant Baek.

146
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,940

147
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,567
Comrades.

148
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,833
Don't act rashly!

149
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,433
Shoot now.

150
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:07,733
I said, shoot now!

151
00:13:10,033 --> 00:13:11,467
I can't trust myself.

152
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:14,900
But I trust you. Just shoot!

153
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:17,333
But what if…

154
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,133
But what if something goes wrong?

155
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,933
Without you, Comrade No,

156
00:13:22,933 --> 00:13:25,667
I have no faith I can live now.

157
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:27,933
That's not true.

158
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,300
Don't say that.

159
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,667
Just…

160
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:33,200
Just shoot already!

161
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,633
What?

162
00:14:05,633 --> 00:14:07,670
This isn't what I intended.
It's a misunderstanding.

163
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,630

164
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,933
Lloyd!

165
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:15,767
No!

166
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,600
Comrade No.

167
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:29,133
Comrade No.

168
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:34,300
Comrade No, wake up!

169
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,333
Wake up!

170
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:40,467
It hurts.

171
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,733
I'm sorry.

172
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:47,133
I should've done it sooner…

173

175

and pretentious you could be

176
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:58,167
and even a bluffer…

177
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:01,733
Say it now.

178
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:05,933
I love you.

Comrade No.

182
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,233
If I can hear it one more time,

183
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:20,967
I'll have no regrets.

184
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:38,033
I love you too.

185
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:41,000
Can you say what you just said one more time?

186
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,633
Which one?

187
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:47,567
I feel a little better
hearing that you love me.

188
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,300
Comrade No.

189
00:15:56,833 --> 00:16:00,000
A bulletproof vest is a must, you know?

190
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:12,300
I'm used to that facial expression.

191
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:23,200
So sweet, man.

192
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:25,567
I feel rewarded

193
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,367
for bridging the lovers together.

194
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,233
I love you.

195
00:16:47,933 --> 00:16:50,433
I love you more.

196
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:12,233
Prosecutors arrested Won Tae Sook,
the first mayor of Pyeonghwasi, a pilot city,

197
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:15,667
on charges of violating
the unification security law

198
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:16,900
and forming an anti-state organization.

199
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,433
Won Tae Sook was accused of supporting and
instigating conflicts between the two Koreas

200
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:25,200
and interfering with
peaceful unification through

201
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,367
an anti-unification
terrorist group called Violet.

202
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:31,800
Pyeonghwasi's disastrous crisis
and the risk to its very existence

203
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,400
were overcome by great efforts of
the Unified Korean Armed Force Unit.

204
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,233
The two Koreas agreed

205
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:42,100
to receive preliminary candidate
registration soon to hold a special election

206
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,000
to elect the mayor of Pyeonghwasi.

207
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,290
[Operating Center]

208
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,920
­

209
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,500
What about you?

210
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,667
Of course, don't worry.

211
00:17:57,667 --> 00:18:00,133
I'll be right here waiting for you.

212
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:02,200
Okay?

213
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,867
Mi Rae, when you're finished with your surgery,

214
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:06,633
let's go play at Pyeonghwa Park again.

215
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:08,367
Let's eat gimbap and ramyeon,

216
00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:11,000
and I'll win you a giant plush toy too.

217
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,167
Please sing for me too.

218
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:15,667
I'm indeed a better singer than Avon, right?

219
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:17,500
Yes, of course.

220
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,533
You're serious about singing.

221
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,467
I'll be back.

222
00:18:23,467 --> 00:18:27,633
Meanwhile, please take good care of my sister.

223
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,733
Let's go inside now.

224
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:34,100
Baek Mi Rae, you've got this.

225
00:18:34,867 --> 00:18:37,633
Don't you worry a thing.

226
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:42,430
­

227
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,133
Don't worry too much, okay?

228
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:01,567
She'll be okay.

229
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:03,633
She has dystocia.

230
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:06,500
She's carrying two, not one.

231
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,733
Bringing new lives

232
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:10,700
isn't going to be easy.

233
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,000
Be patient.

234
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,390
­

235
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,667
What do you mean?

236
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,700
I'm sorry

237
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,233
that I didn't tell you sooner.

238
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,667
Did

239
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:38,900
Comrade Seong Jae Hoon really come by?

240
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:42,167
Yes.

241
00:19:51,867 --> 00:19:54,067
Thank you for coming.

242
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,067
I have no reason to avoid you.

243
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:58,100
I lost so much because of you.

244
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,900
So what? Do you want to take revenge?

245
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:05,033
I don't have a reason to do so anymore.

246
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:07,667
Because I'm leaving.

247
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:09,633
Then, why did you want to see me?

248
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:13,700
I want to catch one of
them at least before I go.

249
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,867
Shadow?

250
00:20:15,867 --> 00:20:19,567
I've never seen them in person,
either, so I don't know who it is.

251
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:21,967
But I know what their next plan is.

252
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:25,400
Shadow will attempt to kill you for sure.

253
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,467
Number Ones of the South and
North cannot be the targets now.

254
00:20:28,467 --> 00:20:31,233
So you'd make the most impact.

255
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:34,400
And the moment you're targeted

256
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,000
will be the golden opportunity
to capture Shadow.

257
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,867
So, it sounds like you're
asking me to be the bait.

258
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,500
But why should I?

259
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,433
Because we must catch Shadow
in order for Yeong Ok to return.

260
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:48,267
And why should I trust you?

261
00:20:48,267 --> 00:20:51,667
For Yeong Ok's sake, I don't want

262
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,033
you to be hurt.

263
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,933
In any case, they're going to
try to take you to a safe house.

264
00:20:57,933 --> 00:20:59,733
Based on the safe house information alone,

265
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:02,433
we can't conclude that person to be Shadow.

266
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,267
But what if I change the location abruptly?

267
00:21:05,267 --> 00:21:08,600
If someone knows about
that and contacts Seung Tae,

268
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,033
that person would be…

269
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:11,233
Shadow.

270
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:13,567
Yes.

271
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,000
Is that why you did such a thing?

272
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,267
Offered yourself as bait?

273
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,033
Yes.

274
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,500
­

275
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,500
T-Thank you.

276
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,300
Our baby, Pyeong Hwa, is born.

277
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,833
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

278
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,800
What about Tong Il?

279
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,867
As for Tong Il… Not yet.

280
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:34,800
My goodness. This is

281
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,667
so hard. So hard.

282
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,270
­

283
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,100
Mom.

284
00:23:27,867 --> 00:23:31,467
- Please eat.
- Eat up.

285
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,833
Is the guardian of Baek Mi Rae here?

286
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:38,033
Yes. I'm Baek Mi Rae's guardian.

287
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:42,167
Her surgery went well. She's
in the recovery room now.

288
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:44,133
Thank you.

289
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:47,333
Please charge this credit card.

290
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:50,767
You may pay at the reception.

291
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:53,967
At the reception?

292
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:55,533
- Got it.
- Okay.

293
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:58,100
Lloyd?

294
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,400
Song I.

295
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,100
What are you doing here?

296
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,133
Hey, you…

297
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:07,733
Are you all right?

298
00:24:07,733 --> 00:24:10,100
Are you sure you're okay?

299
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,533
I am.

300
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,967
I'll be able to walk again.

301
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,167
I'm sorry to cause you trouble.

302
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:18,167
No, don't say that.

303
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:20,467
I'm so relieved and thankful

304
00:24:20,467 --> 00:24:23,133
that you're up like this.

305
00:24:23,867 --> 00:24:27,233
You'll hold a concert once
you get discharged, right?

306
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:29,433
I'll go for sure.

307
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:31,667
Of course, you must.

308
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,133
I'm a father now!

309
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:36,900
Sir!

310
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,700
Sir!

311
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,500
Congratulations. Congratulations.

312
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,567
Now I'm Pyeong Hwa and Tong Il's father.

313
00:25:06,133 --> 00:25:08,300
Comrade Seung Min is holding up well.

314
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,400
Comrade Sae Yeong, you're doing great.

315
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,733
It's only been five minutes. Hang in there!

316
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:17,133
Bring on the strength of the corn

317
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:19,700
that you ate in times of suffering.

318
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:23,033
- Hey, remember the hell week. Hang on.
- Who's the boss? Come on, let's go!

319
00:25:23,033 --> 00:25:24,167
35, 36…

320
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:25,767
- Hang on for a little longer.
- 37.

321
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:28,067
- 38.
- Come on, man.

322
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:31,200
What was that?

323
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,400
What do you think you're doing?

324
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,800
Come to think of it,

325
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,433
this is meaningless.

326
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:40,633
I quit.

327
00:25:40,633 --> 00:25:42,367
I quit too.

328
00:25:42,367 --> 00:25:44,233
But it's only been five minutes.

329
00:25:44,233 --> 00:25:46,967
Weak. Bros, you're all weak.

330
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:03,200
Come here for a second.

331
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,267
Drink this.

332
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:46,467
Now that Mi Rae's surgery went well,

333
00:26:46,467 --> 00:26:48,900
let's unite now.

334
00:26:49,867 --> 00:26:52,567
That's not up to us.

335
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:05,233
I mean, the two of us should unite first.

336
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,467
Let's be together for the rest of our lives.

337
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:13,900
Are you

338
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,233
asking me to marry you?

339
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:18,633
Answer me now.

340
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,433
I don't want to.

341
00:27:27,133 --> 00:27:28,867
Why not?

342
00:27:28,867 --> 00:27:31,267
W-Why not?

343
00:27:31,267 --> 00:27:34,400
Both of us want to be together
so desperately. So, why not?

344
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,633
I don't want to.

345
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:39,533
Tell me if I'm lacking something or
if you don't like something about me.

346
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,300
I'll fix it.

347
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,733
Why are you like this all of a sudden?

348
00:28:01,967 --> 00:28:04,400
You order me around to deliver boxes.

349
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,700
Are you sure I'm the owner?

350
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,000
Why do you keep ordering wine
that doesn't even sell well?

351
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,367
Natasha.

352
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:15,067
She used to like it.

353
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,100
Natasha.

354
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,400
She looks so lovely.

355
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,660
­

356
00:29:14,067 --> 00:29:16,767
When are we going to unite?

357
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:18,867
Well, when the time comes, I suppose.

358
00:29:18,867 --> 00:29:21,800
So, when is that?

359
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,100
I heard that marriage is off limits if you'll
continue being a singer after your discharge.

360
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,767
So you're saying, you haven't
accepted my proposal for my sake?

361
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:32,900
Not necessarily.

362
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,200
I love you.

363
00:29:36,633 --> 00:29:38,533
I too

364
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,900
love you.

365
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:47,233
What do I do?

366
00:29:49,033 --> 00:29:51,433
Can you say it one more time?

367
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,667
I

368
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:00,133
do

369
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:02,867
