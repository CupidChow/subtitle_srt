1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,400
If you move even a single step,
I'm going to pull the trigger.

2
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,833
You, an idol star, is going to shoot me
with those hands that used to hold a mic?

3
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:23,867
Yes.

4
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:25,000
Do you want to test it out?

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,567
Is that a real gun at least?

6
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,967
Do you think I came here unprepared?

7
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:52,933
Our unit members will arrive soon.

8
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:55,433
Let's take care of these punks all together.

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,667
- Are you all right?
- Lloyd!

10
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,533
My stomach.

11
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,133
Where are they?

12
00:01:11,133 --> 00:01:13,467
Come out!

13
00:01:13,467 --> 00:01:15,100
Hello.

14
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,367
What on earth is going on?

15
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:19,100
Mind your own business.

16
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,867
You don't even belong to our unit anymore.

17
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:23,533
How could I not mind it?

18
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:27,200
My fan risked her life for me
and is dying right now.

19
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,500
Why are they trying to kill Song I?

20
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,767
I need to know.

21
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:36,533
Fine. You've seen it yourself,
haven't you, Comrade No?

22
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:40,333
Things could go down really badly.

23
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:43,733
You got lucky and survived
with a fake gun this time,

24
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:46,067
but you'll have no such luck next time.

25
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:50,167
I don't want to get involved, either,
but these things keep happening.

26
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:52,400
It doesn't seem to have anything
to do with me, but it does, right?

27
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,500
Am I wrong?

28
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:08,333
[Pyeonghwa Metropolitan.
See you again.]

29
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:13,300
The separated families of South and North
aren't moving in as much as we expected.

30
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,900
It's been more than 70 years
since the country was divided.

31
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,433
It's a given, don't you think?

32
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:21,833
I'm sure many people
already passed away while waiting.

33
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:24,967
To draw the entire nation's attention,

34
00:02:24,967 --> 00:02:27,633
we need fresh impetus.

35
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:28,933
For example,

36
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:31,600
we promote it using Lloyd.

37
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:36,367
You're really using him
for everything, aren't you?

38
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:40,600
Isn't he returning to the PR Support Unit?

39
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,567
No, he isn't.

40
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:45,800
Lloyd belongs to the Unified Armed Force Unit.

41
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,867
We can do anything.

42
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:50,033
I'm sure you're well aware,

43
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:53,800
but you can't pressure him
or do things unofficially.

44
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,833
Of course not.

45
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:55,833
This decision

46
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:59,467
is based on the agreement between Lloyd and me.

47
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:04,300
Please submit reports on how
we can give additional support

48
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,700
to separated families of Pyeonghwasi.

49
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,700
Yes, ma'am.

50
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,467
What a nuisance.

51
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,167
Is that Song I's cell phone?

52
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,133
I knew it.

53
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:39,200
It's my birthday.

54
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,733
What are you doing here?

55
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:44,600
Can't you guess it just by
looking at the wallpaper?

56
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:49,600
Look at these. They're all pictures of me.

57
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,833
Lieutenant Baek.

58
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,667
Let's work together, won't you?

59
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,767
I'm absolutely certain
that I can be of help to you.

60
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,600
Answer my question at once.

61
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,267
What are you doing here, Comrade No?

62
00:03:59,267 --> 00:04:01,933
Unification! Private No Gwang Yeon.

63
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:04,733
I was ordered to serve
in the Unified Armed Force Unit…

64
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:08,567
I came here of my own volition.

65
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:17,900
Hey, my dear fellow soldiers.

66
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm back. Everyone, make some noise!

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,167
Lloyd. Oh, my gosh. What the…

68
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:26,733
What's with that face?

69
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,033
People don't maltreat me
like this in other places.

70
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:30,633
I wonder why you're like this.

71
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:33,333
Comrade No, are you not
taking military seriously?

72
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,100
Why do you keep changing your mind?

73
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,967
You guys are so ridiculous.

74
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:40,600
Didn't you try to convince me
that this is a good place?

75
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:43,200
It's not because of the pay, right?

76
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,900
Okay, listen. I came back because… Well…

77
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:50,900
Since you're new, you sort the garbage.

78
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,900
I missed you, bro. I really did.

79
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,700
But I did it last week.

80
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,267
It's your turn to do it this week, John Kim.

81
00:04:58,267 --> 00:05:01,200
I think Korean is really hard to understand.

82
00:05:04,967 --> 00:05:09,067
That entertainer figured out

83
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:11,800
the girl's cell phone passcode, right?

84
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes, I requested for a forensic analysis.

85
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,367
Didn't I tell you?

86
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:21,667
I told you, there must be a reason
why that girl visited the hospital.

87
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:26,367
There's definitely something between the two.

88
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,500
Don't you think so?

89
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,367
In my opinion, it's just a singer and his fan--

90
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:30,833
Did you look up the vehicle records?

91
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:31,967
Yes.

92
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:34,533
It's a car belonging to a small
advertising photography company.

93
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:36,033
It wasn't registered under a fake name?

94
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:37,600
It doesn't seem like it.

95
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,767
No, wait.

96
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,967
They're trying so hard to kill a mere girl.

97
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:48,500
They must be looking for something.

98
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,633
Shouldn't we find it before they do?

99
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:53,667
I'll find it.

100
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,100
Let's confirm it first.

101
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:02,067
Let's use bait.

102
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:06,967
If the bait works, it means
there's something that will be useful.

103
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,000
Things will get interesting
for the first time in a long time.

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,400
Let's cast a net and corner the fish.

105
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,200
Why did you change your mind all of a sudden?

106
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,233
Something came up so I must do.

107
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,600
I wonder what it is.

108
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,167
Ms. Seo, can you look into someone for me?

109
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,533
Are you asking me to dig someone's background?

110
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:47,533
You were the only person
I could think of to ask for help.

111
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:50,267
I was the only person you could think of?

112
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:59,200
If you're asking me as a friend,
not as your lawyer, I'll help.

113
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,167
A friend? Sure, let's do that then.

114
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:06,300
But in return, you have to do
a favor for me next time.

115
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,300
How does that sound?

116
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,667
Okay, sounds good.

117
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,633
What do you mean by bait?

118
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:25,933
Who else?

119
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:29,233
Do you mean, Comrade No?

120
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,833
Didn't they try to kill a girl who doesn't
even have a chance of surviving?

121
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:37,367
To eliminate any possibilities,

122
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:41,267
they wouldn't leave Comrade No
alone, don't you think?

123
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:43,333
If Comrade No has something,

124
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:46,100
there's no reason why he wouldn't tell us.

125
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,000
How would you know?

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Are you sure about that?

127
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:54,000
But it would be dangerous for him
to be included in the mission now.

128
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,533
Comrade No hasn't gotten proper training yet…

129
00:07:56,533 --> 00:07:59,467
What do you think you're
doing worrying about him?

130
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:13,133
Gosh, you startled me.

131
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:15,000
You should've knocked.

132
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,367
We're all busy. Let's not
fuss over things like that.

133
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:20,133
What brings you here?

134
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,833
If you're going to contribute,
you should make it firm.

135
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:26,300
We should do marketing that you
love so much, Vice Commissioner Lee.

136
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,500
What marketing?

137
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,267
With the entertainer,

138
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:35,867
shouldn't we make a flashing show
of the Unified Armed Force Unit?

139
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:37,667
For the reunion of separated families,

140
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:42,400
let's draw attention of all people
in both the North and the South.

141
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,533
That's quite ambitious.

142
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:48,667
I was already thinking about it.

143
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:50,200
Is that right?

144
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,367
You can take all the credit for it,
Vice Commissioner Lee.

145
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:57,033
They say, "strike while the iron is hot."
Let's proceed immediately.

146
00:08:57,033 --> 00:08:59,700
You really love starting things immediately,

147
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,800
Sounds good. Right now.

148
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,833
I'll let you get back to work.

149
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:13,767
Why wouldn't it go in?

150
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:51,367
Hold on.

151
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:53,067
No outsiders are allowed here.

152
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:55,467
May I see your ID?

153
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,167
I'm sorry. I'm terrible with directions.

154
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,600
Comrade Seong Jae Hoon?

155
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:13,667
What brings you here?

156
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:14,900
I came to see you,

157
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,067
but I ended up getting lost.

158
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,367
I didn't know you were coming. What's going on?

159
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:37,833
I was just curious

160
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,933
about the Unified Armed
Force Unit of North and South.

161
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,767
Isn't the mood quite different
from that of the Republic?

162
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:47,233
I never imagined

163
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,533
that the world will come in which
we who were raised as warriors of the Republic

164
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:51,300
are no longer needed.

165
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,200
I doubt that.

166
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,167
Comrade Seong Jae Hoon,
you were injured serving our country.

167
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:59,967
Wouldn't they compensate you
once the unification happens?

168
00:13:01,267 --> 00:13:04,367
Compensate me? How?

169
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:09,733
I've never seen a soldier as great as you.

170
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:12,800
Look at me.

171
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,400
I'm totally just a civilian now.

172
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,433
I like the way things are now.

173
00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:21,967
I think I'll be busy soon.

174
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,933
Really? Is something going on?

175
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:27,633
I'm totally dumbfounded.

176
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:29,233
It wasn't enough that they meet up outside

177
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:33,233
and now he even makes a visit
to the unit to have a date?

178
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:39,667
Don't interrupt Comrade Major General Baek.

179
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:41,600
Comrade Gae, I'm not trying to interrupt.

180
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,500
I just need to tell her something. Okay?

181
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:46,167
Gosh, let go of me!

182
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:48,000
Hey, wait. Can you listen to me for a second?

183
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,367
No, it's not like that. Hey!

184
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:58,300
Answer your phone.

185
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,100
Got it. I'll come up.

186
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:10,633
You must be busy. I'm sorry that
I came to visit unannounced.

187
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:12,533
No worries.

188
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:14,367
Okay.

189
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:17,200
Then, get back to work. I'll go now.

190
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:27,500
I'll go now. Bye.

191
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:48,633
Gwang Tae must be a young
man in his twenties now.

192
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:52,533
Yes.

193
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:56,067
He takes after his father,

194
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:59,000
so I'm sure he's handsome.

195
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:05,867
On behalf of Pyeonghwasi,

196
00:15:05,867 --> 00:15:08,633
I'd like to express my sincere
gratitude to the hard work

197
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:10,700
of the Unified Armed Force Unit.

198
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,267
Gratitude?

199
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:15,300
They're doing their duty as soldiers.

200
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:20,400
You're the symbol of Pyeonghwasi now.

201
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,533
And as for Private No Gwang Yeon,

202
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:27,300
he's the face of Pyeonghwasi.

203
00:15:30,267 --> 00:15:32,267
In any case,

204
00:15:32,267 --> 00:15:35,967
I plan to create a calendar
using you as models.

205
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:37,500
And the entire proceeds

206
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,667
will be used for the separated
families of Pyeonghwasi.

207
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:42,933
Private No Gwang Yeon. I have a question.

208
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:44,000
Yes, go ahead.

209
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,500
Well, your intentions are good.

210
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,533
But did you come to
an agreement with my agency?

211
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,600
That's a good question.

212
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,200
Private No Gwang Yeon, you're a member
of the Unified Armed Force Unit now.

213
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,967
Please don't forget that.

214
00:15:57,967 --> 00:15:59,100
A model?

215
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,100
How can we make a fool of ourselves like that?

216
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,967
You're a warrior of the Republic.
Is there something you aren't capable?

217
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:05,067
No, sir!

218
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:08,900
I'll make sure to do my best
to contribute to the Republic!

219
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,567
Private No Gwang Yeon.

220
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:19,333
At this filming,

221
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:23,133
may I expect to see your
outstanding performance, Comrade No?

222
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,300
I'll do my best.

223
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:30,300
Unification.

224
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:36,533
Comrade Vice Commissioner.

225
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:38,133
Please consider it one more time.

226
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:39,367
Not just Comrade No,

227
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:42,267
but it could put our unit
members in danger too.

228
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:49,367
We must take risks to get results.

229
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:13,367
Now that you don't wear military
uniforms, are you ignoring my orders?

230
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:15,367
No, sir.

231
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,300
Seung Tae.

232
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,500
Let's not get ahead.

233
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,800
Jae Hoon.

234
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,867
We have to kill Lloyd.

235
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:27,900
You know that, don't you?

236
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,767
If Song I handed over the file
to Lloyd, all of us are in danger.

237
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:33,600
Don't make me repeat myself.
We have to wait until the right time!

238
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,833
We used up all our chances of getting into
the Unified Armed Force Unit because of you.

239
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,267
Your rash judgment

240
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,600
has become a big obstacle
for our organization's future. Got that?

241
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,633
Is it because of Comrade Baek Yeong Ok?

242
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,000
What did you say?

243
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,633
Rather than our organization's safety,

244
00:17:56,633 --> 00:18:00,467
it seems like you're more concerned about her.

245
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,500
Comrade.

246
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,833
Did you forget how we
got to where we are today?

247
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:19,433
Let's not cross the line.

248
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,000
Got that?

249
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:59,567
I believed North and South could never unite.

250
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:02,433
It's really amazing news.

251
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,667
Today, the leaders of the South and the North

252
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:07,033
agreed to build a peace city in the DMZ,
which was a symbol of division,

253
00:19:07,033 --> 00:19:08,500
a place that the two Koreas will cohabit

254
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,100
ahead of unification.

255
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,133
Based on the June 15th
North-South Joint Declaration,

256
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:17,700
the unification issue should be resolved
autonomously by joining forces as one nation…

257
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,433
Jae Hoon, do you think
unification is really possible?

258
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:26,467
Then, will we go back to North Korea?

259
00:19:26,467 --> 00:19:28,667
Just eat. The food is getting cold.

260
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,000
I can't get in touch with Mr. Jung.

261
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:38,833
Since when?

262
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,167
I think it was starting last week.

263
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:56,733
Barriers kept piling up over time of 70 years.

264
00:19:58,567 --> 00:20:01,333
It led to greater mistrust and ignorance.

265
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,367
And people who are indifferent
about unification.

266
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:10,533
And that became a stronger barrier

267
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:13,400
that I ended up believing there's no
future where the Korean Peninsula

268
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,700
will be united.

269
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,833
- Seung Tae.
- Yes?

270
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,300
Look to the right and run right away.

271
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:31,167
You go that way.

272
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:32,200
It'll be dangerous on your own.

273
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,767
- There's no time. Go report it!
- Jae Hoon.

274
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:35,800
Go now!

275
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,267
We, who gave our lives for the Republic…

276
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:29,467
Jae Hoon.

277
00:21:29,467 --> 00:21:31,633
were eliminated like that.

278
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,533
Like slaughtered animals.

279
00:21:46,567 --> 00:21:49,433
Next, this one. Chocolate.

280
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,300
Yes, okay.

281
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,467
Let me put them aside first.

282
00:21:54,133 --> 00:21:56,500
Count this one too.

283
00:22:00,233 --> 00:22:03,533
It seems like it was unsuccessful again.

284
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:06,333
Every time they visit
the separated families liaison office,

285
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,233
they feel down.

286
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:11,367
As for the family of Grandfather Seok,
she must be over 80 years old now.

287
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:13,200
So it's uncertain if she's still alive.

288
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,167
As for Ms. Geum Sook, she doesn't even
know if he's in the North or the South,

289
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:20,700
or somewhere in China.

290
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,100
This country isn't even that big.
I feel so bad for them.

291
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,567
Honey, let's always be thankful as we live.

292
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,967
Yu Jin.

293
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:34,333
Shouldn't you go to your
parents' place to give birth

294
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:35,733
and recover there?

295
00:22:35,733 --> 00:22:37,600
But you can't come.

296
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,400
I'll just give birth here.

297
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,600
I feel so ashamed before your parents.

298
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,967
As for your parents who passed away,

299
00:22:45,967 --> 00:22:48,733
I can't even visit them.

300
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:52,100
So what's the point of having trains
that run at 400km per hour?

301
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,533
We can't even go visit.

302
00:22:54,533 --> 00:22:56,400
When our kids, Peace and Unification, are born,

303
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,200
let's hope that we can go
back and forth freely.

304
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
Let's hope.

305
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:06,867
It's a soldier's duty to protect
our country bearing arms.

306
00:23:06,867 --> 00:23:09,467
What do they mean, we have
to take pictures to promote?

307
00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:13,300
Promoting is what you guys do best.

308
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,067
Yo! Come on, man. It's for a good cause.

309
00:23:16,067 --> 00:23:20,533
It's for a good cause. We've got this, bro.
Come on, let's get it. Give me give.

310
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:23,267
Gosh. For Pyeonghwasi's peace, I'll do it.

311
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:24,467
Don't get too excited.

312
00:23:24,467 --> 00:23:25,800
Lloyd will get the lead role,

313
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,067
and we'll just be in the background.

314
00:23:28,067 --> 00:23:29,100
What's wrong with you?

315
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,333
I'll show them the spirit of North Koreans.

316
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,167
I'll show them what I got too.

317
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:37,033
- I'll do my best!
- That's right. Let's go!

318
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:47,100
Comrade Do Hyeon, come with us.

319
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,400
Okay, here we go.

320
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,467
You're the heroes who protect Pyeonghwasi.

321
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:21,967
You'd gladly sacrifice your life.

322
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:25,400
Don't forget the theme of being
the brave special forces soldiers.

323
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,133
Listen to them talking carelessly
since it doesn't concern their own lives.

324
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,400
Please look over here.

325
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,200
Okay, one, two.

326
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,367
Please change the pose a little.

327
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,833
Okay, one, two.

328
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,167
Okay, great.

329
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:43,667
Here we go again. Do a different pose.

330
00:24:50,433 --> 00:24:52,467
Look cooler.

331
00:24:57,867 --> 00:24:59,933
I'm so honored, Mr. Lloyd.

332
00:24:59,933 --> 00:25:02,533
I'm not a singer now. I'm a soldier
who protects our country.

333
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:04,567
What are you talking about?

334
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:07,500
You're Lloyd, the lead dancer
and the lead singer of FITA.

335
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,800
You're making me blush. Please stop.

336
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,767
Mr. Lloyd, we'll take a couple
of solo shots of you from now.

337
00:25:12,767 --> 00:25:15,100
Sure, sounds good.

338
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:35,267
Seung Tae, do you seriously have a death wish?

339
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,467
I'm dead already.

340
00:25:38,033 --> 00:25:39,800
It's a trap. Get out of there now!

341
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,867
I'm just doing what I need to do.

342
00:25:42,867 --> 00:25:45,100
You focus on what you need to do, Jae Hoon.

343
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,300
Gosh, darn it. What was that?

344
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:26,733
The ten o'clock direction. Number
three and four, block the path.

345
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:28,867
Rest of you, follow me.

346
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:39,633
What Han Song I stole

347
00:27:39,633 --> 00:27:42,800
was the list of names of Violet members.

348
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:51,133
You punk, you should've told us sooner.

349
00:27:57,767 --> 00:28:00,133
You must find it and bring it to me.

350
00:28:00,733 --> 00:28:02,533
Yes, sir.

351
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:04,433
Will they give us the pictures?

352
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:07,133
If my mom back in my
hometown sees it, she'd be so…

353
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:12,000
Don't you have a girlfriend?
All you talk about is your mother.

354
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,300
Don't show your bitterness
of being deprived of your mother's love.

355
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,833
What did you say?

356
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:18,367
Hey, stop fighting, man.

357
00:28:18,367 --> 00:28:22,400
My mother will be so happy to see my picture.

358
00:28:29,633 --> 00:28:32,067
Song I, I'm here.

359
00:28:36,933 --> 00:28:38,600
You shouldn't be here, Lloyd.

360
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,500
I think it's my fault.

361
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,033
I reported it because I was worried about you.

362
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:48,400
But I never asked them
to let me see you. I'm serious.

363
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:54,000
The ones from the 112 unit

364
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,933
can't be spies or terrorists
now that things are peaceful.

365
00:28:56,933 --> 00:28:58,433
After they got abandoned by the Republic,

366
00:28:58,433 --> 00:29:01,233
they formed Violet.

367
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,100
Hey, Song I. What's the matter?

368
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,433
Song I!

369
00:29:22,433 --> 00:29:24,800
Doctor! She needs help.

370
00:29:26,367 --> 00:29:27,433
It's cardiac arrest.

371
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:28,900
- We'll perform CPR.
- Okay.

372
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,800
One, two, three, four,

373
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,967
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

374
00:29:33,967 --> 00:29:35,433
- Vital signs?
- 90 over 44.

375
00:29:35,433 --> 00:29:37,300
- Blood pressure?
- It's dropping, Doctor.

376
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,467
Let's do it one more time.
Get the resuscitator ready.

377
00:29:38,467 --> 00:29:40,467
Yes, Doctor.

378
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:02,900
Four, five, six.

379
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,900
- It's getting better.
- Seven. Is it?

380
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,900
- She's okay now.
- I'm so relieved, Doctor.

381
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,967
Thank you for your hard work.

382
00:30:09,967 --> 00:30:12,033
She's okay now.

383
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:19,233
Seriously, what happened to you?

384
00:31:17,467 --> 00:31:19,833
What are you looking for?

385
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,267
I was conducting a surprise
inspection of the barracks.

386
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:35,967
If you're possessing anything illegal,
according to the penalty rules--

387
00:31:35,967 --> 00:31:37,867
So did you find it?

388
00:31:37,867 --> 00:31:40,000
The illegal item?

389
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,867
I guess not.

390
00:31:48,467 --> 00:31:51,767
Do you have to work right now when you haven't
seen me, your mom, in such a long time?

391
00:31:51,767 --> 00:31:54,000
Isn't it good to be busy?

392
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,200
You were late because you were working too.

393
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,800
I'm proud of you for doing it
on your own without my help,

394
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,133
but seriously, who are you doing this for?

395
00:32:03,133 --> 00:32:05,867
Someone I want to have.

396
00:32:05,867 --> 00:32:08,367
I've never seen you like this before.

397
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,095
Once I get him, I'll show him to you first.

398
00:32:13,095 --> 00:32:18,120
[Pyeonghwasi Mayor Won Tae Sook]

399
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:23,700
How come I'm the only one who didn't know?

400
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:28,067
All the members of the unit
knew what they needed to do,

401
00:32:28,067 --> 00:32:31,500
but I was the only one who
was making a fool of myself!

402
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:35,533
What are you looking for?

403
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:38,267
Is it because you think
that I got something from Song I?

404
00:32:38,267 --> 00:32:40,833
That's just a jumper.

405
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:43,400
If you got something from her,
hand it over to me now.

406
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:48,033
So just tell me exactly what that is.

407
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:49,867
You'll be in danger if you hold on to that.

408
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:51,467
No, actually,

409
00:32:51,467 --> 00:32:55,333
I need to make sure you don't
have it to ensure your safety.

410
00:32:56,533 --> 00:32:58,833
You bluffer.

411
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:03,000
I really mean it.

412
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,333
Seriously, what is the truth?

413
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:08,167
What I know is that Song I saved my life,

414
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:11,000
but I couldn't protect her. That's all.

415
00:33:12,233 --> 00:33:14,833
Who protected whom?

416
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:17,567
You can't even protect yourself.

417
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:22,933
So you were trained in the 112
Daenam Training Center?

418
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:29,500
Then shall we battle it out
forgetting our ranks?

419
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,800
Your life depends on this.

420
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,300
Stop acting like such a fool!

421
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,600
Otherwise, I can't protect you.

422
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,600
Have you actually protected someone?

423
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,633
You get shot or stabbed all the time.

424
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:46,867
You can't even protect your own body.

425
00:33:46,867 --> 00:33:48,533
You always pretend to be tough on the outside,

426
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:50,467
but you're a softy in the inside.

427
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:54,600
Don't be mistaken thinking
that you know me so well.

428
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,067
I doubt you have any idea

429
00:33:58,067 --> 00:34:00,967
what kind of a person I am.

430
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,367
♫ Believe that you will return ♫

431
00:34:06,367 --> 00:34:08,100
♫ Whatever it is, I believe in you ♫

432
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,433
♫ I can't find you anymore ♫

433
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:11,767
♫ I believe in our hearts in those days ♫

434
00:34:11,767 --> 00:34:14,867
♫ Even though it may be foolish
to turn around ♫

435
00:34:14,867 --> 00:34:16,567
♫ Back to that time on my way ♫

436
00:34:16,567 --> 00:34:18,833
♫How are you doing? Goodbye ♫

437
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:22,000
♫ Who will understand my feelings?
Oh, my heart ♫

438
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,933
♫ Only you can know. No, my heart ♫

439
00:34:25,933 --> 00:34:28,433
♫ I can't be with you no more ♫

440
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,067
♫ A little more, a little more ♫

441
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:32,067
♫ I'm getting closer to you ♫

442
00:34:32,067 --> 00:34:34,933
♫ Don't look back and don't hesitate ♫

443
00:34:34,933 --> 00:34:37,533
♫ This day won't come again ♫

444
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,933
♫ Tonight ♫

445
00:34:38,933 --> 00:34:41,667
♫ Don't turn away ♫
