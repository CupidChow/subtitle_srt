00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,930
(World of Street Woman Fighter)

2
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,569
- Hello. - Hello.

3
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,629
(The crews are back in Korea after the Mega Crew Mission.)

4
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,639
(Happy to see the staff)

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,670
- Hi. - Your hair!

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,169
(On their 1st day of filming 3 months ago)

7
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,869
(The dancers returned to Korea, looking completely different.)

8
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,239
(This was her 3 months ago.)

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,779
We're back in Korea.

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,709
(This was her 3 months ago.)

11
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,719
I changed up my style. My hair's long now.

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,319
- I dyed my hair. - Right.

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,319
- Yes, she dyed her hair. - She did.

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,619
And Monika has a more youthful vibe now.

15
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,659
- That's right. - Right.

16
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,019
My bump is gone.

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,659
(Congratulations on the birth of your baby!)

18
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,059
(At the time of the World of K-pop Mission, )

19
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,229
(Monika was still carrying her baby.)

20
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,629
- Goodness. - Yes, my stomach's flatter now.

21
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,699
Us too.

22
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,230
From the moment we began monitoring the show,

23
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,069
we became more conscious of it.

24
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,369
Street Woman Fighter is about dance,

25
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,409
but being fashionable is also really important.

26
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,510
It makes the show more fun to watch.

27
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,080
(AG SQUAD's Vanessa and Danica's eye-catching bikinis)

28
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,819
(Since the first day, they've been wearing bikini tops.)

29
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,079
(Vanessa's bikini compilation: 1. When she's dancing)

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,719
(2. When she's happy)

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,689
(3. When it's cold enough to see her breath)

32
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,260
(4. When she has to wear the team uniform)

33
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,090
(On days she's not wearing a bikini top?)

34
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,090
I'm holding heat.

35
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,859
I think I'm used to Australia where it's always hot.

36
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,769
It's like a form of expression for me.

37
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,800
(Vanessa, you look amazing in your bikinis. Keep doing you!)

38
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,269
(Minami's hair is green to match the color of OSAKA Ojo Gang.)

39
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,369
Ms. Green Hair.

40
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,370
I'm a little bit scared.

41
00:01:42,371 --> 00:01:45,579
That's right. My hair matches my crew's color.

42
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,950
It costs me more than half of my rent to maintain this hair.

43
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,619
I usually go to the hair salon,

44
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,689
but in Korea, my teammates help me with my hair.

45
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,749
(Focused)

46
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,360
To maintain this color, my hair has to be dyed every six days.

47
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,889
(Kyoka is my hair stylist for the day.)

48
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,729
("How to dye hair" by Kyoka. Step 1: Pull at her hair)

49
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,389
(Step 2: Pull at her hair some more)

50
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,459
(Step 3: Knock her head with the comb)

51
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,399
(Step 4: A playful bop on the head?)

52
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,139
Kyoka is different from how she looks.

53
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,140
(With her rough but meticulous hands, )

54
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:13,440
(Kyoka made sure Minami's green hair stays flawless!)

55
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,009
(This girl loves to chew gum.)

56
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,109
(Even when she's in a dance battle, )

57
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,410
(when she's trying to intimidate the other crews, )

58
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,249
(or when she's listening to someone on the other crew talk...)

59
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,049
(While talking to her leader, )

60
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,379
(she saved her gum.)

61
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,450
(She loves chewing gum so much that she doesn't throw it away.)

62
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,289
("I want to know what gum she chews. Fantaye is chewing gum again.")

63
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,760
(So we asked Fantaye, "What is gum to you?")

64
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,129
Focus. Chewing gum helps me stay focused.

65
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,500
I feel like it even helps me do more facials.

66
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,670
This is...

67
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,069
I brought it from America.

68
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,969
(The big reveal of the gum Fantaye brought from America)

69
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,500
This is my favorite gum.

70
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,539
Everyone's been asking me.

71
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,009
- How many are in there? - Hold up.

72
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,739
(Thinking)

73
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,480
I just bought three packs.

74
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,650
(Fantaye has also been wearing many different earrings.)

75
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,990
(Huge earrings are part of Fantaye's signature look.)

76
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,819
(She likes to hang everything from her ears. What are earrings to her?)

77
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,189
- Yes, the earrings. - Yes, I wear different earrings.

78
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,859
But I actually packed so many earrings.

79
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,829
I have 20 earrings with me.

80
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,729
- That's cool. - Yes, they're like a part of you.

81
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,830
I feel like it's just gum and earrings.

82
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,540
That's me.

83
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,970
"What are lashes to me?"

84
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,109
You don't let anyone touch them.

85
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,209
That's true. My lashes are quite...

86
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,580
Why? Are you interested?

87
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,850
Here. Are you interested?

88
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,979
To me, lashes are like brushing teeth. The end.

89
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,919
(She said, "Like brushing teeth")

90
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,249
People brush their teeth every day.

91
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,659
To me, it's no dance, no life.

92
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,320
But it's also no lashes, no life.

93
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,030
You look like a giraffe with them.

94
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,760
(Rico Hirai, the giraffe)

95
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,630
Do any of you wear lipstick in this color?

96
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,329
Or do you wear green or black lipstick?

97
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,300
You're just talking about makeup. Do you have to act so tough?

98
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,669
Since my skin tone is darker,

99
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,939
I don't look good in red lipstick.

100
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,979
I actually think that color is the worst shade on you.

101
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,079
What are you talking about?

102
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,849
I want to see you wear that shade. Just once.

103
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,709
No. Never.

104
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,079
You'll look like you just stepped out of the pool.

105
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,249
(Like this?)

106
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,089
I'm a creative person.

107
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,050
That's what dancers are. Creative.

108
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,159
Let's see what my next hairstyle, my next outfit will be.

109
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,359
Let's see what my whole aesthetic will be.

110
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,429
Hair. Nails done. Eyebrows done. Lashes done.

111
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,829
Outfit's better, makeup's better.

112
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,869
(I love shopping.)

113
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,740
We're on the hunt for outfits.

114
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,110
I'm so hungry.

115
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,369
I feel like they'll ask what kind of outfits we're looking for.

116
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,010
I feel like everything depends on how we do.

117
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,649
We have your size.

118
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,610
You have my size? Mine?

119
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,150
(This is Kyoka's outfit for tomorrow.)

120
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,620
- It says "AG SQUAD." - Gosh.

121
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,319
(They got to check out the WSWF pop-up store...)

122
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,320
(for winning the World of K-pop Mission.)

123
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:44,390
AG.

124
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,419
That's so cool.

125
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,360
Look, they've got little bandanas.

126
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,500
It's like a little carabiner.

127
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,400
- Gosh. - What is this?

128
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,900
What is this?

129
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,470
This is...

130
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,839
Okay, I want this one.

131
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,340
I want that, as well.

132
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,639
You want that one?

133
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,909
There are so many things that are so cute.

134
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,250
Okay, wait. Come on, they've got stickers.

135
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,709
- So cool. - Guys.

136
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,179
My mom would love this.

137
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,679
"Seoul my soul."

138
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,219
- I love it. - Because I love it here in Seoul.

139
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,919
- That's nice. - You can go right there, girl.

140
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,820
The new design. It's new fashion.

141
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,560
- Look at this. - Boom. Boom. Boom.

142
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,430
- All in Aus! - All in Aus!

143
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,929
That's cute.

144
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,200
(Let's keep this momentum going. AG SQUAD, let's take 1st place!)

145
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,569
World of Street Woman Fighter is powered by...

146
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:36,170
product sponsorship and partnership with a leading K-culture brand.

147
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,509
(With the world as their stage, )

148
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,349
(the five crews created their Mega Crew Mission videos.)

149
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,009
(The highest number of views this season)

150
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,079
(In just 3 days, it hit 10 million views.)

151
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,419
(The video received playful comments and shout-outs...)

152
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,249
(from various government agencies and organizations.)

153
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,889
(Even in Japan, the two crews' videos became trending.)

154
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,859
(In America and Australia, as well.)

155
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,660
(It even appeared in the Australian news.)

156
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,759
And they're raking up millions of views.

157
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,329
This job that we're doing now is very special,

158
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,369
and it's very exciting for us.

159
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,439
We've received so much support.

160
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,809
As one of the dancers on this show,

161
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,139
I was reminded to take it more seriously,

162
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,479
and it helped me reconnect with my original mindset.

163
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,249
(Street Woman Fighter's iconic Mega Crew Mission)

164
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,249
You need experience for the Mega Crew Mission.

165
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,419
You'll only do well if you have experience with a mega crew.

166
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,689
Honey J was part of the crew that won the Mega Crew Mission.

167
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,259
We specialize in mega crews.

168
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,719
We're a massive threat to everybody.

169
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,029
The ability to manage a large group of people...

170
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,799
Ruu is going to win this one.

171
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,699
This season, the mega crew mission has a completely different vibe.

172
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,499
This isn't just about dancing.

173
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,599
It's about telling your country's story through your moves.

174
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,939
So you're really going to see a piece of art.

175
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,109
We were involved in...

176
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,139
(Music)

177
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,009
There's an orchestra playing in the background.

178
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,709
Wouldn't it be nice to have a Japanese artist?

179
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,749
(Stage)

180
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,479
I think we should use special effects.

181
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,480
(Creative direction)

182
00:06:51,481 --> 00:06:52,749
I made a storyboard.

183
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,949
Let's use some snakes.

184
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,949
Wotagei glowsticks and waacking.

185
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,189
(Costume)

186
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:01,059
(Location)

187
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,689
We're here at Shibuya.

188
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,799
(Elevate your country's pride...)

189
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,229
(with your performance.)

190
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,729
Because it was more important to be true to the art.

191
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,099
I don't expect us to do the Elimination Battle.

192
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,599
People will resonate with our video.

193
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,009
They're going to love the final video.

194
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,579
I don't think we'll end up last.

195
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,039
Our video is really well put together.

196
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,549
(Let's see.)

197
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,350
They gave us fifth place?

198
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,179
(We'll tear...)

199
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,349
(you up.)

200
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,249
You all forgot this is a competition.

201
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,589
(And tonight, )

202
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,359
(the Mega Crew Mission will decide...)

203
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,759
(who stays and who leaves.)

204
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,189
This high-angle choreography.

205
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,829
I don't think it can get any better than this.

206
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,159
(They all gave them 100 points for everything?)

207
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,929
(Which two crews will end up doing the Elimination Battle?)

208
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,269
I was like, "No way."

209
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,469
My heart dropped.

210
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,900
I can't predict the outcome at all.

211
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,809
(The last chance to move on to the semifinal round)

212
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,380
Who will be claiming that fiercely contested spot?

213
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,850
I hate this.

214
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,340
(Day of the second Elimination Battle)

215
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,880
Hello.

216
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,949
- Hello. - Hello.

217
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,180
(All 5 crews have arrived.)

218
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,050
(AG SQUAD's Crew Agit)

219
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,019
Do you have lip liner? Did you bring lip liner?

220
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,720
- I don't know. I can't find it. - It's here.

221
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,060
I'm stressing too much.

222
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,700
I strongly believe that we're not going to go home.

223
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,430
Because we won the K-pop mission, apparently.

224
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
(Sighing)

225
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,870
(But she keeps sighing.)

226
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,870
(Sighing)

227
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,379
(Sighing)

228
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,980
With the views going now online, we are coming second to last,

229
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,250
so I'm a bit worried.

230
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,449
It's so annoying...

231
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,490
because our video is definitely one of the best.

232
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,589
And we're in the bottom two. This just doesn't make sense.

233
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,590
I think we should...

234
00:09:14,591 --> 00:09:19,299
I thought we would go a little bit more viral than what we did.

235
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,830
So AG SQUAD made a TikTok.

236
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,840
And it was a Korean chant,

237
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,710
which was basically saying, "Vote for us."

238
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,309
Obviously for the view count.

239
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,310
(AG SQUAD uploaded a heartfelt video in Korean to encourage voting.)

240
00:09:30,311 --> 00:09:32,239
(Vote for us.)

241
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,879
(We're AG SQUAD.)

242
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,080
(We're AG SQUAD.)

243
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:43,249
I just don't know what to expect, and I feel nervous.

244
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:48,130
So I hope that our likes help us bump up our score.

245
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,560
Are you going to... Are we...

246
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,200
The Elimination Battle?

247
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,000
I think we're battling.

248
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,470
We're battling.

249
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,599
Right now, we're third in views.

250
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,909
But the thing is, we're not that far away in views...

251
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,280
from AG SQUAD,

252
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,709
compared to the difference between us and OSAKA Ojo Gang last time.

253
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,350
- Yes. - That's why I'm like...

254
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,819
And they have more comments than us.

255
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,680
That's been the only thing that's made me go,

256
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,790
"Yes, we're going to have to battle."

257
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,759
(Thinking)

258
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,860
I'm not wearing these.

259
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,790
I'm definitely wearing this to battle.

260
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,400
But I want to battle Kyoka.

261
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,129
(Did someone say my name?)

262
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,829
- We're in second place, right? - Yes.

263
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,799
- Thank you. - Thank you.

264
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,139
(Congratulations, OSAKA Ojo Gang, on ranking 2nd in views.)

265
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,140
- I'm happy. - Thank you.

266
00:10:33,141 --> 00:10:34,310
I'm very happy.

267
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,039
Of course, because we were last for the World of K-pop Mission.

268
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,010
- That's right. - Did you see how we put in our all?

269
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,680
That's how sincere we are about this.

270
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,850
I think people will judge us highly if that resonates with them.

271
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,680
So far, we're in second place.

272
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,189
So perhaps, that could put us in first place.

273
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,019
You think the rankings could change?

274
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,389
With the fight judges' score?

275
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,160
That and the likes?

276
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:56,960
They haven't announced the likes yet.

277
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,400
I wonder what the results will be.

278
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,630
But, obviously, first place will be...

279
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,869
(You know what I'm trying to say, right?)

280
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,769
I'm being blunt, but I think we'll win by a landslide.

281
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,470
We crushed the Mega Crew Mission by a landslide.

282
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,110
I've never been this sure.

283
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,510
Since the high-angle choreography is one of the evaluation categories,

284
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,450
I think we'll beat the others in that.

285
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,749
I think the judges would have loved that part.

286
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,249
Before, I was kind of scared to see the results.

287
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,919
But now, I can't wait to check our scores.

288
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,049
- Me too. - Don't make it too obvious, though.

289
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,359
Okay. Make it BUMSUP.

290
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,360
Make it BUMSUP.

291
00:11:25,361 --> 00:11:27,559
BUMSUP.

292
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
Let's go.

293
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,499
(Coming up shortly)

294
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,930
(The shocking Elimination Battle)

295
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,409
(In the fight zone, )

296
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,980
(which two crews will end up between elimination and survival?)

297
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,580
(Now)

298
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,860
(The Mega Crew Mission results will decide the crews' fates.)

299
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,690
(Elimination Battle)

300
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,809
(Let's see...)

301
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:18,340
(which two crews will end up battling in the fight zone.)

302
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,740
Amazing.

303
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,079
The set looks completely different.

304
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,510
- This is much better. - Amazing.

305
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,380
This is hyping me up.

306
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,220
It's not a ring.

307
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,750
You like this song, Kyoka.

308
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,559
Dancing here would be nice.

309
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,560
Totally.

310
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,560
They're here.

311
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,230
The day has come.

312
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,660
The tension. I feel nervous.

313
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,070
It's obvious they feel discouraged.

314
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,700
They totally lost their confidence.

315
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,339
Even now, how they're dressed is like, "I'm going to battle."

316
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,739
- Let's go girls. - Yes.

317
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:53,480
Even on the last day of voting, our view count remained low.

318
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,450
I was ashamed as the director and the leader.

319
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,550
I really don't want RHTokyo to go...

320
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,190
because of what they're showcasing.

321
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,920
- It's important. - Yes.

322
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,490
It's starting now.

323
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:11,529
(All 5 crews have entered the fight zone.)

324
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,530
Hello, I'm the host of World of Street Woman Fighter, Sung Han Bin.

325
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,169
(Hello.)

326
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,399
(Hello.)

327
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,670
The signature mission of Mnet's original dance series,

328
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,510
the Mega Crew Mission, is over.

329
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,110
With the world as your stage, you gathered dozens of dancers...

330
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,519
and created a single performance.

331
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,789
That couldn't have been easy.

332
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,820
However,

333
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:40,090
not all five crews that are here...

334
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,990
can join the next performance.

335
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,600
- I can't believe this. - Who will be eliminated,

336
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,030
and who will survive?

337
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,400
This is the moment of truth. Some will rise, some will fall.

338
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:55,340
Which crew will be eliminated today?

339
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,340
We did well.

340
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,740
Whatever this result is,

341
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,179
we're not going home.

342
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,350
Even if we have to battle, we're not going home.

343
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,480
The Mega Crew Mission will decide the fates of the five crews.

344
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:11,759
The fight judges' score and the Global Public Evaluation...

345
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,559
will be added for the final score.

346
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,030
And the lowest-ranking two teams...

347
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,130
will go against each other in the Elimination Battle.

348
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,860
I don't want to.

349
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,870
Since this is an important mission right before the semifinal round,

350
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,899
the fight judges were joined...

351
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,769
by a special judge, Lia Kim.

352
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,080
(In awe)

353
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,910
She's 1MILLION.

354
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,309
I respect that.

355
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,480
She was the winning mega crew.

356
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,179
(Fight Judges Evaluation Day)

357
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,650
- Hello. - Yes.

358
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,749
While I was away,

359
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,020
you did a great job of hosting the show. Thank you.

360
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,359
And Lia.

361
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,430
- Long time no see. - Yes, it's been a while.

362
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,699
(The leader of the global dance studio, 1MILLION, )

363
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,970
(and a K-pop choreographer who created countless hits)

364
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,269
(In Street Woman Fighter 2, as the leader of 1MILLION, )

365
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:03,309
(she led her team to the most views for the Mega Crew Mission.)

366
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,339
For last season's Mega Crew Mission,

367
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,250
Rie Hata was actually sitting here.

368
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,850
She was the special judge for the Mega Crew Mission.

369
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,620
So we were shown a video of Rie Hata evaluating us.

370
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,349
- The best. - That's what's fun about this.

371
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,759
Now, Rie Hata is over there as a participant.

372
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,389
This situation feels incredible.

373
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,630
Gosh, it must have been tough.

374
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,969
It seems so fun,

375
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,369
but I can't imagine how tough it must have been.

376
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,440
- It's not fun. - It's not?

377
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,870
(Laughing)

378
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:34,410
It's exhausting.

379
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,680
You need experience for the Mega Crew Mission.

380
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,309
First, AG SQUAD is...

381
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,709
a team that rose to fame with this.

382
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,819
And K-pop choreographers all have experience...

383
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,180
because of year-end awards ceremonies.

384
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,949
Rie Hata has also choreographed for a lot of year-end awards ceremonies.

385
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,060
I think MOTIV also has a lot of experience.

386
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,860
So they may be younger,

387
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,799
but they're still veterans in dance.

388
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,430
But among them, Rie Hata is still the most experienced.

389
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:04,770
- Right. - Yes.

390
00:16:04,771 --> 00:16:08,170
I'm actually looking forward to the Korean team.

391
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,279
This season, the team is full of people...

392
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,340
who have directed the Mega Crew Mission.

393
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,409
So I think they'll know a lot about this.

394
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,979
I'm so excited.

395
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,180
I'm very excited.

396
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,549
Let's go.

397
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,590
(Mega Crew Mission, let's go!)

398
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,659
The fight judges have watched each crew's video.

399
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,260
High-angle, national identity,

400
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,360
directing, and choreography.

401
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,870
These are the four categories they have given scores for.

402
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,570
Each category is worth 100 points.

403
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:45,580
If all 3 judges give you full points for all 4 categories,

404
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,450
you will get the maximum score of 1,200 points.

405
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,679
(Gosh)

406
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,749
He said 1,200 points.

407
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,920
Even if you don't do well in just one category,

408
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,390
that could affect your overall ranking.

409
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,260
So showing great execution for everything was important.

410
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,860
I'm getting butterflies.

411
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,230
The Global Public Evaluation...

412
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,300
was conducted through...

413
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,100
WSWF's official YouTube channel, “The CHOOM,”

414
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,480
from June 17, right after the episode aired, to 6pm, June 22.

415
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,810
The Global Public Evaluation score...

416
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:24,310
is determined by adding the view counts...

417
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,479
to the number of likes multiplied by 100, which will decide...

418
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,990
the ranking.

419
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,319
The winning crew of the Global Public Evaluation...

420
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,520
gets 1,200 points.

421
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,659
The crews ranked 2nd to 5th...

422
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,530
will be given tiered scores based on their ranking.

423
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,370
Immediately after the videos of the Mega Crew Mission were released,

424
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,169
for the first time in Mnet’s original dance series history,

425
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,740
all crews' videos simultaneously ranked...

426
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,670
in the trending charts in their respective countries,

427
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,580
garnering major attention worldwide.

428
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,910
Nice.

429
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,479
(We're amazing.)

430
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,620
The total view count of the Mega Crew Mission videos...

431
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:06,260
was 30,778,204 views.

432
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,890
It reflected the overwhelming support from viewers worldwide.

433
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,430
That's not all. The video by Team Korea, BUMSUP,

434
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,999
received comments from the accounts of public institutions, such as...

435
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,040
the Cultural Heritage Administration and National Heritage Center.

436
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,080
Praised as a performance of national heritage-caliber,

437
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,919
it hit 10 million views only 3 days after it was released.

438
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,120
This is a record-breaking first for the Street Woman Fighter series.

439
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,120
That's crazy.

440
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,390
- To all our dancers, thank you. - To all our dancers, thank you.

441
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:45,830
However, only the view counts have been revealed so far.

442
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,770
In the previous World of K-pop Mission,

443
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,700
OSAKA Ojo Gang and ROYAL FAMILY...

444
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,599
had high view counts...

445
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,109
but not enough likes, which led them to lose the competition.

446
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,180
They ended up participating in the Elimination Battle.

447
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,709
How will this mission turn out?

448
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,350
Please stay tuned.

449
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,050
I'm nervous.

450
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,050
We'll just smile.

451
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,120
Smile. We got this.

452
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,530
First off, Team Japan.

453
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,030
OSAKA Ojo Gang's fight judges' score will now be revealed.

454
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,830
- We're the first ones? - Yes.

455
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,369
I'm curious.

456
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,970
Since there are two Japanese teams,

457
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,970
I am concerned about the national identity category.

458
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,439
It's quite stressful when things overlap.

459
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,249
To make completely different performances,

460
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,019
they would have had to put a lot of thought into this.

461
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,119
(The two Japanese crews would have struggled more.)

462
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,550
I'm curious to see how they expressed it differently.

463
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,190
Yes.

464
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:46,259
(The day OSAKA Ojo Gang filmed their Mega Crew Mission video)

465
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:51,630
(The dancers look very worn out for some reason.)

466
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,659
What I really want us to remember is that...

467
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,370
we can make the video darker later.

468
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,270
That's quite important.

469
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,069
I wanted to be deliberate with the shifts in energy.

470
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,940
(What happened with OSAKA Ojo Gang?)

471
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,810
Good morning.

472
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,819
Today is our first rehearsal...

473
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,180
with the 100 dancers.

474
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,090
I'm so excited.

475
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,960
There are so many people.

476
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,960
(The rehearsal studio is packed with people.)

477
00:20:20,961 --> 00:20:23,989
- Hello. - Hello.

478
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,959
I'm Ibuki, the leader. I look forward to working with you.

479
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,799
I'm Ruu, the director of...

480
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,899
this Mega Crew Mission. It's a pleasure to be working with you.

481
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,669
- Thank you in advance. - Thank you in advance.

482
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,140
(Ruu is OSAKA Ojo Gang's director for the Mega Crew Mission?)

483
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,579
Mega Crew Mission.

484
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,309
Ruu is going to win this one.

485
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,449
(Laughing)

486
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,049
Before we even came here,

487
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,379
we had chosen Ruu...

488
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,849
to be in charge of our crew...

489
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:47,949
for the Mega Crew Mission.

490
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,489
Her ability to manage a large group of people...

491
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,360
is the best in Japan.

492
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:57,959
Fabulous Sisters is a crew that I founded in 2016.

493
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,929
I truly loved sharing with the world...

494
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:03,429
the performances I made together with my many teammates,

495
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,869
carefully crafted over time like a brilliant fireworks show.

496
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,409
"It's finally my time to shine!"

497
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,909
That was what I thought about this mission.

498
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,579
Ruu, you're the person I want to depend on the most...

499
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,679
for this Mega Crew Mission.

500
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,950
So I want you to really lead us.

501
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,850
I put a lot of thought into this.

502
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,089
I dedicated significant effort...

503
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:26,789
into exploring creative ways to reimagine the symbols of Japan.

504
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,789
I created a performance while envisioning a fusion of...

505
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,500
the new Japan with OSAKA Ojo Gang's color.

506
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,199
I wanted to approach it with a concept that could highlight...

507
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,300
the best of Japan from a new perspective.

508
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,200
Even the props are things we haven't really used before.

509
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,209
I was thinking about using light.

510
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,209
- Like glow sticks? - Glow sticks.

511
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,879
Japan's hardcore fan culture,

512
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,549
like our culture of cheering for idols.

513
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:54,550
I thought that culture suited OSAKA Ojo Gang.

514
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,819
Toward the end of the video,

515
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,659
the glow sticks turn green.

516
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,389
It means that everyone becomes a fan of OSAKA Ojo Gang's.

517
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,489
I thought of it with the hope that people will cheer for us.

518
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,299
Another thing we have to be aware of is that...

519
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,539
there's another crew representing Japan.

520
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,169
It's RHTokyo.

521
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:16,769
So we wanted to take a novel approach in doing so.

522
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,939
We had to show our uniqueness as OSAKA Ojo Gang.

523
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,049
Ojo, which means "lady," and "gang" are two different things.

524
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,179
OSAKA Ojo Gang's image is always relaxed,

525
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,719
cool, and chill.

526
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,119
We're always seen as being full of confidence.

527
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,889
But "Ojo" has a totally different image.

528
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,859
It's glamorous and more luxurious.

529
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,829
It screams "woman power."

530
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,629
So I wanted OSAKA Ojo Gang to show that kind of power.

531
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:42,969
There's an orchestra playing in the background.

532
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,099
The music should have a fast and strong tempo.

533
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,439
I want it to be cool.

534
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,739
I loved feeling the pressure on me.

535
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,309
Pressure is what brings good results.

536
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:57,609
(For the costumes of 100 dancers, )

537
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:02,250
(they designed and checked even the smallest details.)

538
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,459
We worked from early April to May,

539
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,159
so production took about a month.

540
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,829
The vibes were great and everything was moving fast.

541
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,730
I don't think there were any issues.

542
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,330
We'll show you what we've got.

543
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,739
(And one day in May)

544
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,299
(One by one, )

545
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,769
(OSAKA Ojo Gang flew into Korea?)

546
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,879
- Hello. - Hello.

547
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,410
- Hello. - Long time no see.

548
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,249
(A practice studio in Seoul)

549
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,249
(OSAKA Ojo Gang is practicing in Korea.)

550
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,450
(Just then)

551
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,749
Hello.

552
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,090
- Hello. - Hello.

553
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,929
(The visitors to the practice studio...)

554
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:45,059
(are the members of TWICE.)

555
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,499
- We appreciate you working with us. - We appreciate you working with us.

556
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,700
- We appreciate you working with us. - We appreciate you working with us.

557
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:55,009
I want to invite a special guest.

558
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:58,179
My younger sister, Momo of TWICE.

559
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,309
(Momo of TWICE is Hana's younger sister.)

560
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,949
(The first female idol group to hold a concert at an overseas stadium)

561
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,079
(A group that won over not only fans in Korea but also worldwide)

562
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,489
(A global K-pop icon, TWICE)

563
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:13,359
I asked her if she could join us,

564
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,029
and she said "Of course."

565
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,530
(Yes!)

566
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,860
In that moment, I was thankful that I was Momo's older sister.

567
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,999
I'm not sure we'll be of much help,

568
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,039
but we'll do our best.

569
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,269
(We have faith in you.)

570
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,409
Thank you.

571
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,010
With the TWICE members helping us,

572
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,549
I thought we'd gain an advantage in terms of view counts,

573
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:39,249
which we did not have for the previous mission.

574
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,150
It was incredibly encouraging.

575
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,460
I think it's been ten years since Hana and I danced together.

576
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,159
When we were younger, we were on the same dance team.

577
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,460
Whenever our eyes meet, it reminds me of that time.

578
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,370
It's been ten years, but we still have good chemistry.

579
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:02,209
I felt the Osaka spirit that OSAKA Ojo Gang shares with Momo.

580
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,609
Since we're doing this anyway, we wanted to win.

581
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:06,539
And Momo also had this mindset.

582
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,709
The floor of the set was wet with water...

583
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,820
and there were other issues.

584
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:15,420
With the determination to help us overcome this mission...

585
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,150
and the will to win this mission with us,

586
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,260
they really helped us a lot.

587
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:24,190
I think it was an amazing miracle.

588
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,560
Cut.

589
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,829
- Good job, everyone. - Good job, everyone.

590
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,099
OSAKA Ojo Gang, TWICE, let's do this!

591
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,339
(They wrapped up their shoot in Korea with a cheerful chant.)

592
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,740
(After they finished the meaningful shoot in Korea...)

593
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,710
Today is finally the day we're filming...

594
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,279
OSAKA Ojo Gang's mega crew performance video.

595
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,139
I thought the high-angle choreography...

596
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,909
was a very important point,

597
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,049
so I put a lot of care into making it.

598
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,519
When we film the high-angle,

599
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,350
it's going to be Ruu and the Fabulous Sisters.

600
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,659
This is an evaluation category, so everyone has to be perfect.

601
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,490
- Okay. - Okay.

602
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,789
We practiced a lot,

603
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,930
so I was confident.

604
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,259
- Are you ready? - Ready.

605
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,960
Five, six, seven, eight.

606
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,570
She made various versions.

607
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,570
But eventually, we went with a cherry blossom-like choreography.

608
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:11,009
We went with that concept to show the beauty of Japan.

609
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:14,180
The vibes were great and everything was moving fast.

610
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,649
That's very nice. I love it.

611
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,150
I gave it my all.

612
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,349
- Ruu, shall we go? - Yes.

613
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,420
The part with 100 dancers.

614
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,749
The wotagei with 100 dancers.

615
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,360
The wotagei with 100 dancers.

616
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,559
(They're shooting the highly anticipated glow stick part.)

617
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:33,260
The choreography highlights the lingering trails of glow sticks,

618
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,969
so I wanted to make sure there was a lot of contrast...

619
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,200
between the light parts and the dark parts.

620
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,740
I want to check the footage.

621
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,440
How did it turn out?

622
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,970
- It's not that dark. - This one?

623
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,339
It wasn't as well-defined as I expected.

624
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,979
You can't see the motion trails of the glow sticks at all.

625
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,549
If the contrast in brightness is not too strong enough,

626
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,750
people won't be able to really see what we're doing.

627
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,320
It's too bright.

628
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,250
It's still nice when we make it darker, right?

629
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:01,019
The shoot was supposed to last about two hours,

630
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,760
but we spent half the day struggling with this part.

631
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,699
Every single day, from morning until night,

632
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,930
we dedicated ourselves to this mission.

633
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,470
We pushed ourselves to the limit to produce a great video.

634
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,839
Thank you for participating today.

635
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,739
- Thank you. - Thank you.

636
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,309
Please look forward to our video.

637
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,280
(June, Korea)

638
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:26,219
We're back in Korea after shooting the Mega Crew Mission video.

639
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,449
(Welcome back.)

640
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:31,119
Being back here is kind of giving me PTSD.

641
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,059
- Kind of? More like a lot. - I'm getting way too much PTSD.

642
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,429
We're all hungry right now,

643
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,029
- so we should all eat. - Yes, grab some shakes.

644
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,800
- Yes, take them. - These are really filling.

645
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,800
All you have to do is mix the powder with water.

646
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,070
(Shaking)

647
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,370
- It's good. - It has a rich flavor...

648
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,970
and there are crunchy flakes for texture.

649
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:51,370
I'm already full. This would make a great meal.

650
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,779
(The 5 crews are gathered in their crew agits.)

651
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,979
(They get to watch each crew's final rehearsal video...)

652
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,180
(for the Mega Crew Mission.)

653
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,119
We get to watch the videos?

654
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,820
- They're rehearsal videos, right? - Yes.

655
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,689
(Members of OSAKA Ojo Gang are given mysterious papers.)

656
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,060
Thank you.

657
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,259
(The 5 crews' director's papers...)

658
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,029
(with information on their Mega Crew videos.)

659
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,229
Snakes as props?

660
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,929
Maybe the snakes were their special guests.

661
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,299
I think we'll get good scores.

662
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,699
We have TWICE in our video.

663
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,800
It's obvious we've won.

664
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,100
I was sure we would be first place.

665
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,140
(How did the other crews react to OSAKA Ojo Gang's video?)

666
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,149
- Gosh. - Ojo!

667
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,850
It's here.

668
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,979
(Screaming)

669
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,719
Ojo? Oh, no.

670
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,819
I'm curious.

671
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,319
- Let's go, Ojo! - I like them.

672
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,390
I'm sweating.

673
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,689
I see 100 people.

674
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,090
I'm excited.

675
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,669
(Cheering)

676
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,800
- Cool! - It's awesome.

677
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,470
It's Wotagei culture.

678
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,210
(Never seen it before.)

679
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,239
Are they still waacking, though?

680
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,510
- They're always waacking. - Come on.

681
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,210
- This is so Ruu. - It's Ruu.

682
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,009
This is a real Japanese style.

683
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,349
OSAKA Ojo Gang's performance...

684
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,519
- shows a collage all of a sudden. - That's right.

685
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,889
- And it doesn't feel related. - I think...

686
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,690
OSAKA Ojo Gang best represented the Japanese mood.

687
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,519
- You're right. - It's a Japanese mood...

688
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,159
that I've admired.

689
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,429
Yes, it's something we've seen...

690
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,859
- since Fabulous Sisters. - Yes.

691
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:23,070
The last part was all Wotagei. The last scene.

692
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,669
I like that they used the colors of all the crews.

693
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,939
Like for me, the glowstick thing is a turnoff.

694
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,940
- I get you. - This feels like a vibe from 20...

695
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,110
(Chuckling)

696
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,110
From 2012.

697
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,149
It would go viral since TWICE is in it.

698
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,519
- I think so. - It would.

699
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,219
They might aim...

700
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,579
to get a high number of views.

701
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:45,419
Using a very famous group to get your votes.

702
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,459
Which is smart...

703
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,489
It's smart, but it's not you dancing. It's someone else.

704
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:53,059
I feel like they did the high-angle really well.

705
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:57,000
But I feel like the other sections kind of were...

706
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,539
- That's the high-angle. - I see.

707
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,400
- I mean... - Cool.

708
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,510
It looks like that other crew from last season.

709
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,839
I thought they were 1MILLION.

710
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,149
- It looks like 1MILLION's choreo. - It's pretty similar.

711
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,549
Yes, it really looks alike.

712
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,219
(1MILLION's Mega Crew Video, OSAKA Ojo Gang's Mega Crew Video)

713
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,349
Being able to sense what is similar or not...

714
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,319
is also a director's capability.

715
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,720
- We'll have to see the results. - You're right.

716
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:24,189
Did the visuals reflect each nation's identity?

717
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,029
- I thought the high-angle did. - Yes.

718
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,299
I don't know about the rest of it, though.

719
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,359
I'll vote OSAKA Ojo Gang fourth.

720
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,569
Like it's cool. And they executed it very well.

721
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,769
A lack of...

722
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,369
- Originality? - Yes.

723
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:37,810
And then fifth, we've done OSAKA Ojo Gang because...

724
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,510
it wasn't incredible.

725
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,779
(Osaka Ojo Gang received feedback after the interim check.)

726
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,449
What? We rank fifth in all the feedback.

727
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,619
How come?

728
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,750
"It's cool. The high-angle was well-executed."

729
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,890
"But I don't know about the rest?"

730
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:52,860
What?

731
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,230
What feeling?

732
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,490
These ones.

733
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,430
I'll engrave all of these in my mind.

734
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,030
Watch us. We'll definitely win this.

735
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,199
The fifth is the bottom.

736
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,339
This is crazy.

737
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,669
I hope it'll turn out differently...

738
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,869
from the World of K-pop Mission.

739
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,880
Please.

740
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,679
We were ranked the lowest among the six crews.

741
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,880
To be honest, I was anxious.

742
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:23,089
I think we still lack our signature moves as Ojo Gang...

743
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:27,159
and the feeling of being one team.

744
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,889
The most important thing I thought about in the Mega Crew Mission...

745
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,729
was to enhance the feeling of being one team.

746
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:34,629
(What will the Fight Judges Evaluation be?)

747
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:38,899
High-angle, the national identity,

748
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,370
directing, and choreography. Among these four judging criteria,

749
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:46,239
we'll first see the score...

750
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,340
of the high-angle challenge.

751
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,609
We want to win this mission.

752
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:54,549
I believe they can feel the desire of ours in every scene...

753
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,149
of our performance video.

754
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,819
So, I think we could get...

755
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,220
a good score from the Fight Judges Evaluation.

756
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,259
The choreography wasn't complicated.

757
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,260
It was very... Not good.

758
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,059
(OSAKA Ojo Gang Ranking Prediction from AG SQUAD is 5th.)

759

(OSAKA Ojo Gang Ranking Prediction from MOTIV is 5th.)

760
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,270
Is the best score 100 points from each fight judge?

761
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,399
(Each of the fight judges can give up to 100 points, totaling 300.)

762
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,610
What will the score of the high-angle challenge be?

763
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,150
(The high-angle challenge, 285 points out of 300)

764
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,779
(Applauding)

765
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,980
Isn't it high?

766
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,620
It's a high score.

767
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,820
It's surprising.

768
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,090
Nice one.

769
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,259
(Each fight judge gave 95 points, totaling 285.)

770
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,259
I thought the fight judges were seeing us properly.

771
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,530
I'm sure we'll be in 1st place, not 4th.

889
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,340
would be better than this.

890
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:54,980
Especially the fans!

891
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,049
They knew so well...

892
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,619
how to arrange the colorful elements.

893
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,180
For the idea, I want to give them a perfect score.

894
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:06,760
They made the choreography perfectly for the mega crew.

895
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:10,259
It was neat and simple. They delivered clearly...

896
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,929
what they wanted to bring.

897
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,059
(Agreed.)

898
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,200
Actually, I don't agree with you.

899
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:19,270
I thought the choreography was too simple.

900
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,539
For me, the formation, the movements,

901
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,369
and the angles were so predictable.

902
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,810
It was cliche.

903
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:30,850
Overall, did they convey the Japanese concept...

904
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,649
effectively enough?

905
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,620
It didn't really hit me personally.

906
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:38,189
I think the national identity was shown...

907
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,689
through Wotagei in the last part.

908
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:43,230
I think it's just very creative use because...

909
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:47,999
Actually, Ibuki is good at waacking like these arm styles.

910
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,599
And when it's combined with Japanese culture, Wotagei,

911
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,799
it's a very smart strategy.

912
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,539
- You're right. - They did a great job.

913
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,069
Great point. Brilliant.

914
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,239
(The fight judges are divided on the performance.)

915
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,910
Then, what scores did the fight judges...

916
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:03,080
give for national identity, directing, and choreography?

917
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,850
I'm so curious.

918
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:08,319
(No one can predict OSAKA Ojo Gang's score.)

919
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,789
What we focused on was the mega crew.

920
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:14,720
So, from that perspective, I think we'll rank first.

921
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,660
I'm confident.

922
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:19,700
I'm expecting that we'll get high scores.

923
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:28,170
(Revealing the fight judges' score for OSAKA Ojo Gang)

924
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,870
(What?)

925
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,580
(Thinking)

926
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,949
Among the four criteria, the highest score is...

927
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:41,020
for high-angle challenge,

928
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:44,120
and the lowest score is for directing.

929
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,890
If the score for directing is that low...

930
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,090
That is the C score.

931
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,159
Is it because the flow wasn't connected?

932
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,800
I think they evaluated the overall flow.

933
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,300
It was like rap started suddenly, and TWICE appeared out of nowhere.

934
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:00,569
Whatever it is, a good piece is one you can describe in a sentence.

935
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,909
- That's right. - But it was hard to describe.

936
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,370
Yes. When TWICE showed up,

937
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,909
what I felt was that...

938
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:10,780
it suddenly turned into TWICE's music video.

939
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,980
(Agreed)

940
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,879
It was quite disappointing...

941
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,419
because that part was out of the performance concept.

942
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:19,959
Overall, it wasn't a solid composition,

943
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,190
so I'm a bit disappointed, personally.

944
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:26,330
The total fight judges' score is 1,005 points.

945
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,030
It's still a high score, though.

946
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,030
That's a very good score.

947
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,640
I thought it was such a low score.

948
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,909
It would've been better if it were slightly higher.

949
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,340
It was disappointing.

950
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,909
How will it be for other crews?

951
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,580
What score will they get?

952
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:46,680
I suddenly feel so nervous.

953
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:50,820
(What will be OSAKA Ojo Gang's final result?)

954
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:55,889
We'll watch the Mega Crew Mission performance video...

955
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:57,060
of AG SQUAD.

956
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,229
(Looking forward to it)

957
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,800
AG SQUAD.

958
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,300
Working with a mega crew requires experience.

959
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:06,639
Those who have choreographed for a mega crew can do it well.

960
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,209
First of all, AG SQUAD is famous for this.

961
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:14,510
You're right. AG SQUAD has a lot of experience in mega crews,

962
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:17,780
but they may not have much experience in directing.

963
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,980
So, I'm very curious.

964
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:24,249
It was my first time directing a mega crew.

965
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,889
Working closely with Parris Goebel.

966
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:29,559
I feel like I've learned a lot more from Parris Goebel.

967
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,360
I'm confident to win this mission for the mega crew.

968
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,599
(7 days before AG SQUAD’s Mega Crew shoot)

969
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,340
The setting is what we want.

970
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,999
(Leader Kaea visited the site to check it personally.)

971
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,739
A week before we shot our mega crew mission,

972
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,980
I met Aboriginal Australians.

973
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,450
Isn't the theme also to show our story or country?

974
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,979
It'd be beautiful to have Aboriginal dancing.

975
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,349
It's a very much big part of Australia.

976
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:58,350
- True. - Yes.

977
00:41:58,351 --> 00:42:01,319
We want to really incorporate the Aboriginal culture...

978
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,030
because they are Australia.

979
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:06,630
They are the first ones that were on Australian land.

980
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,399
So, the native culture is Aboriginal.

981
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,799
So, for the beginning. We want traditional...

982
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,069
- Aboriginal music. - Okay.

983
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,470
Their sounds...

984
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,610
(Something like this)

985
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,939
(This is the sound of Australia.)

986
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,479
So, the overall concept is this. We want to acknowledge...

987
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,250
the Aboriginal people of Australia.

988
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,949
So, we're bringing more than just dance.

989
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:31,050
We're bringing culture, history,

990
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:33,460
and beautiful Australia.

991
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:37,529
Indigenous culture, the land, and the wildlife...

992
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:40,499
are very sacred and important to them.

993
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,669
So, that was the best way we could compile our story.

994
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:47,539
Could each scene represent an Australian animal?

995
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:50,469
Because then, my flexibility could be snakes.

996
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:51,739
So, we could cooperate with that.

997
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,339
I do like the snake idea.

998
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,239
- You can dance with snakes. - That'll be sick.

999
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,949
That will be major.

1000
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:00,649
We want to represent Australia in its rawest form.

1001
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,519
And then we want to show us.

1002
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,749
We want to highlight individuality.

1003
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,159
That's why we did different animals.

1004
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,189
She could be a spider.

1005
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,089
You guys can make a spider creature.

1006
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,389
- You like this. - That's mad.

1007
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,800
Spider-Man.

1008
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,530
I think I'm like a Tasmanian devil.

1009
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,469
- That looks scary. - Tasmanian devil...

1010
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:21,140
has a jaw that can bite like this.

1011
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,670
Very similar to me.

1012
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,870
- I'll be a dingo. - My goodness.

1013
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,709
Be a crocodile.

1014
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:28,739
(That's good!)

1015
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,110
Eyes above the water, and we come out.

1016
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:32,510
(That's great.)

1017
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,949
She is so crocodilly.

1018
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:36,349
I just got goosebumps.

1019
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:37,889
And it'd be different from anyone else.

1020
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:40,389
The discussion and brainstorming ideas...

1021
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:42,059
went really well with AG SQUAD.

1022
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,259
We take their ideas. And Kyra and I...

1023
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,890
really make the final decision.

1024
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:48,730
We want to create it like a movie.

1025
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:52,569
Every section is like a series of "Wow."

1026
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:55,899
I really wanted to make our ideas come to life.

1027
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,910
Landmarks of Australia.

1028
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:01,639
As soon as we left Korea to go home,

1029
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,009
I drove around all around the Gold Coast...

1030
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:06,420
looking for a perfect location to suit this.

1031
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,520
It's stunning.

1032
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:09,249
This location is looking pretty cool.

1033
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,449
It's very Aussie, so it's perfect.

1034
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:12,819
This is a massive area.

1035
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,420
You want to make the dingo section here.

1036
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,160
It's so exciting to set our mission.

1037
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:23,099
Say hi, ladies.

1038
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,330
- Hi. - Hi.

1039
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:26,870
These are our snakes.

1040
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,840
Gorgeous snakes.

1041
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,939
(And...)

1042
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:32,239
(a real snake...)

1043
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,640
(and Danica)

1044
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:36,779
She's very comfortable with being around my face.

1045
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,180
Her name is Jessie.

1046
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,619
(Making eye contact)

1047
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:40,620
(Laughing)

1048
00:44:40,621 --> 00:44:42,820
Oh, my gosh. That's insane. Hey, girl.

1049
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:44,989
AG Snake.

1050
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:46,560
I really do love snakes.

1051
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,489
I had the best time. The location was amazing.

1052
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:52,590
Shout out to Kaea, who organizes everything behind the scenes.

1053
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,400
Looking down at the camera.

1054
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,800
Like more fiercely.

1055
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:01,300
Every section in our video was outdoors.

1056
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,610
So, it was quite challenging because...

1057
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,809
On the floor were big pine cones that would've hurt girls' feet.

1058
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:12,920
There were rocks everywhere. It was muddy.

1059
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,480
They weren't wearing shoes because they were snakes.

1060
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:20,320
So, we spent ages clearing the floor.

1061
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,760
Please be very careful with your ankles.

1062
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:26,400
Also, we have lighting as well.

1063
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:29,359
So, it's like a torch.

1064
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,499
(Aaliyah holding the torch)

1065
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:34,269
Dad is here with some lights.

1066
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:36,710
These are big, massive lights.

1067
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:38,909
Period.

1068
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:41,310
We sorted. It's going to be awesome.

1069
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,809
Our production team wasn't big.

1070
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,909
But we luckily have a new lighting up.

1071
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:46,979
Hello.

1072
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:50,020
A wonderful family is helping us to set them up.

1073
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:53,660
Your family members are helping you. It's more special.

1074
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:56,660
Fingers crossed about the sun rising tomorrow.

1075
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,059
(But an hour later...)

1076
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:02,759
So, now, we had an urgent emergency change.

1077
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,969
We actually have our sunrise shot planned.

1078
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:07,400
And the tides...

1079
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,670
The Australian tides do change.

1080
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:13,939
The Gold Coast tides at that time will be in.

1081
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:17,079
We also have the weather saying it's going to rain...

1082
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,150
when we're scheduled to shoot our sunrise shoot.

1083
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,990
But we couldn't do anything.

1084
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:26,019
Our whole schedule has actually moved around.

1085
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,660
(Urgent new details, Intro and outro 2:30pm to 6pm)

1086
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:28,919
(The 3rd day of shoot)

1087
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,589
The intro, the high-angle, and the outro.

1088
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:35,760
We only did it in like 2 to 3 hours.

1089
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,770
It was a struggle working with 40 dancers.

1090
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,140
We had to do it before the sun went down.

1091
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,940
That's why we had a limited time.

1092
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:45,610
It was a rush to capture the high-angle.

1093
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:47,379
We were supposed to film on the sand.

1094
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,380
But the water came in.

1095
00:46:48,381 --> 00:46:50,710
The environment wasn't exactly on our side.

1096
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:53,949
(The seawater comes in as soon as filming starts.)

1097
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:56,249
It was heaps of hiccups doing it,

1098
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:57,950
but we just went with it.

1099
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,360
What?

1100
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:07,500
Working with wildlives is very difficult.

1101
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,299
And I still feel like if we filmed indoors,

1102
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,530
it would've been easier.

1103
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,570
But we didn't want to do that because it's not what Australia is.

1104
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,539
In the end, I'm happy we went through the hard work...

1105
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,879
with working with nature.

1106
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,009
This is kind of what made it special and what was authentic.

1107
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,810
So, I feel like everyone will love the whole thing.

1108
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:26,250
Hopefully.

1109
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:29,620
(Coming back to Korea in June)

1110
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:31,319
We're back.

1111
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:34,160
How are you feeling about the episodes that are out?

1112
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,389
It's good. It's so fun. My mom loves it.

1113
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:38,259
There's an interview of mine...

1114
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,630
where I had no foundation.

1115
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,770
Oh, stop. Have you tried this?

1116
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,100
It's really popular in Korea.

1117
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,939
And it's sweatproof. I'm pretty sure.

1118
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:50,509
It's like a dancer's foundation.

1119
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:52,670
The cushion is so nice on your skin.

1120
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:54,740
It's also pretty on all skin tones.

1121
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,249
Should we take a selfie, guys?

1122
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,979
- Yes. - Yes.

1123
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:59,380
One, two, three.

1124
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,350
AG SQUAD.

1125
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,249
(Come back to Korea. We're AG SQUAD.)

1126
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:06,150
So, we can see everyone's opinion about us.

1127
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,889
It's good. Seeing everyone's reaction.

1128
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:10,030
Let's go.

1129
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:13,059
I love AG SQUAD. Mother nature.

1130
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,260
This is really long.

1131
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,460
Why is it so long?

1132
00:48:15,461 --> 00:48:17,470
They wrote it with care.

1133
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:19,869
I like AG SQUAD because they do...

1134
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:21,539
- everything with their hearts. - I like their attitudes.

1135
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,540
I like their attitudes.

1136
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:24,810
It somehow warms my heart.

1137
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:26,070
- Because of what they wrote. - Yes.

1138
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,980
"The untamed spirit of Australia."

1139
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:32,550
I feel some sort of strong belief.

1140
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:33,919
Australia is about nature.

1141
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,420
- Yes. They probably show us nature. - Yes, I think so.

1142
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,550
They used two snakes.

1143
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:40,860
- Snakes? - This part sounds awesome.

1144
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,860
I want to see animals.

1145
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:44,360
They're snakes.

1146
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:50,769
The choreo captured the country's culture.

1147
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:52,669
So, that's great feedback.

1148
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:55,169
Everyone commented such a positive thing.

1149
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:59,109
Everyone appreciated that we represented Australia,

1150
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:01,040
which was our main focus.

1151
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,250
(Thinking)

1152
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:06,750
Okay.

1153
00:49:06,751 --> 00:49:09,149
Did it look like about 50 people at the beginning?

1154
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:11,419
- Did they have 100 people? - I don't think so.

1155
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:13,159
Were there really 130 people?

1156
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,259
I don't think so.

1157
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,889
It says 130 dancers.

1158
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:17,989
But I thought, "Where are the 130 dancers?"

1159
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:20,399
But it didn't quite deliver that.

1160
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,629
The impact you'd expect from 130 dancers.

1161
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:24,699
Okay. That's okay.

1162
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,039
I didn't really listen to that feedback because...

1163
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,239
You know, everyone has a different schedule.

1164
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,839
Especially because a lot of dancers,

1165
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,009
they have 9-to-5 jobs.

1166
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:37,349
It's hard to get everyone in one place.

1167
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:40,749
We were using different dancers for every section.

1168
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:44,389
So, we'd only rehearse for about 2 to 3 hours each section.

1169
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:47,259
For example, we did the snake section on Monday,

1170
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:49,160
and then we filmed it the next day.

1171
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:52,629
The schedule was the biggest difficulty for me. Absolutely.

1172
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:56,260
Kaea was the one who had to do all the location scouting.

1173
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:58,529
She organized all the rehearsals.

1174
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:02,199
You know, sorting out. All of the stuff for the video.

1175
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,009
She was getting really stressed.

1176
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:06,380
I saw her really stressed, on the verge of crying.

1177
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,240
So, now we just...

1178
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,949
It's been a bit hard...

1179
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:14,879
because a lot of locations have fallen through.

1180
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,250
But, no. It's all good. I don't have time to cry.

1181
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:21,319
So, there was a lot of stress on my shoulders.

1182
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,089
I'd wake up in the morning, look after my kids,

1183
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:27,329
go to rehearsal, film the section,

1184
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:29,729
then go home and put my kids to bed.

1185
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:31,199
I definitely cried a lot...

1186
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,870
because I was so stressed out. I was so overwhelmed.

1187
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:37,039
It is the day before we start...

1188
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,410
shooting Mega Crew Mission.

1189
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,279
I mean, today's been hectic.

1190
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,579
Unfortunately.

1191
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:48,379
And I'm also trying to manage this Mega Crew Mission...

1192
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,090
as well as my three kids.

1193
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,219
Time to clean up.

1194
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,990
I do the washing,

1195
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,760
feed my kids, make sure they have a nap.

1196
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,829
Say hi. And...

1197
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:02,330
Luckily, I haven't had a mental breakdown yet.

1198
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,770
No, there is no more ice cream.

1199
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:08,299
Kaea was there the whole time as well, so...

1200
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:12,469
Kaea, as the main director, was great at supporting us.

1201
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:15,179
Yes, she is my main thank you, and I am so grateful for her...

1202
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:16,909
because I wouldn't be here without her.

1203
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:19,350
She's a mother, so it was really nice to see.

1204
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,950
Guys. Good job.

1205
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,349
Five, six, seven, eight.

1206
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:28,519
- AG SQUAD! - AG SQUAD!

1207
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,089
We're just so grateful for all of them.

1208
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:33,999
We wouldn't have been able to do it without these amazing dancers.

1209
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,759
I'm so proud of the AG SQUAD girls.

1210
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,429
That we got through it. I feel like...

1211
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:39,840
we have the video that can win.

1212
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:42,769
We reveal the fight judges' score...

1213
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:45,470
for AG SQUAD, Team Australia.

1214
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:48,210
I think they might get a high score.

1215
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:50,009
I think they might get a perfect score.

1216
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:51,710
(Curious)

1217
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:53,849
Among the four judging criteria,

1218
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:57,850
we'll see the score for directing.

1219
00:51:58,090 --> 00:51:59,319
Directing? Now?

1220
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,720
Yes. Directing.

1221
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:04,729
It was my first time directing a mega crew.

1222
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:08,900
But I'm very confident in AG SQUAD. We have the best mega crew video.

1223
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,270
We have to beat OSAKA Ojo Gang.

1224
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:14,140
OSAKA Ojo Gang's directing score is 235 points.

1225
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,540
- I think they'll get a good score. - I think it'll be high.

1226
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,269
(AG SQUAD's directing score is higher than OSAKA Ojo Gang's)

1227
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:21,179
(Satisfied)

1228
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,140
(Thinking)

1229
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:26,379
The directing score is higher than OSAKA Ojo Gang's.

1230
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,720
So, AG SQUAD will rank first.

1231
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:32,090
We'll watch the Mega Crew Mission performance video...

1232
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:33,590
of AG SQUAD.

1233
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:37,729
We're going to Australia now.

1234
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:39,999
Let's go!

1235
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,459
(Excited)

1236
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,330
(Curious)

1237
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:44,730
Let's go.

1238
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,440
(Outback, AG SQUAD Down Under, Executive Director: Kaea)

1239
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:52,839
A boomerang is thrown not just through the air...

1240
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,780
but through generations.

1241
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,649
We pay respect to the traditional...

1242
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:58,480
- custodians of the land, - That scene already beat it all.

1243
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:00,549
We pay respect to the traditional...

1244
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:03,690
- custodians of the land, past, - I want that. I love that so much.

1245
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:08,719
Their stories are carried in the trees, the sand, the creeks,

1246
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,090
- I love this style. - the tides...

1247
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:12,629
- This is cool. - It's awesome.

1248
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:14,159
- Respect. - Indeed, respect.

1249
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,130
This is Australia.

1250
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,029
She caught that boomerang.

1251
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,300
(This is it!)

1252
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,800
I don't want to cry.

1253
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,110
It must've been really hard.

1254
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:33,250
I love it!

1255
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,320
I have goosebumps.

1256
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:39,450
(In awe)

1257
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,920
Look at their energy.

1258
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,619
It's cool. It's like a movie.

1259
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:44,460
(Kangaroo)

1260
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,030
- It looks strong. - So powerful.

1261
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:52,669
(Completely immersed)

1262
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:54,100
(Concentrating)

1263
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,710
Kaea!

1264
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,909
(Crocodile)

1265
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:01,280
Vanessa! Oh, my gosh!

1266
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:02,680
This is crazy.

1267
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:04,180
(Smiling)

1268
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:05,880
Crocodile!

1269
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,519
Splash!

1270
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,820
- Yes! - Let's go!

1271
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:13,590
Let's go!

1272
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:19,959
(Fainting from joy)

1273
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,930
Is that a snake?

1274
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:25,270
This is crazy.

1275
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,239
(Snake)

1276
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,470
That's my favorite part.

1277
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,480
Danica looks awesome.

1278
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:37,480
I love it.

1279
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:41,180
Great transition.

1280
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:43,179
- Three dingos. - This is crazy.

1281
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:45,049
Those three are so powerful.

1282
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:47,160
Kyra! Let's go!

1283
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:54,600
She's so powerful.

1284
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,400
It's a mosh pit up in there.

1285
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,870
Don't fight.

1286
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,840
Kaleece!

1287
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,150
They're full of energy.

1288
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,809
Kaleece!

1289
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,250
Kaleece!

1290
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,190
It's a spider.

1291
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,520
A spider.

1292
00:55:22,521 --> 00:55:25,690
(Spider)

1293
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,960
So powerful.

1294
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:32,029
Look at the details.

1295
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:33,639
- Respect. - Respect.

1296
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,740
Oh, my gosh.

1297
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,470
IDCO?

1298
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:38,770
He's famous.

1299
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:41,310
Is that Josh Cesan?

1300
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,049
Go!

1301
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:45,080
This is cool.

1302
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:53,250
This is crazy.

1303
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,020
It's so clean.

1304
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,730
Let's go!

1305
00:55:57,830 --> 00:55:59,160
The choreography had better be 100 points.

1306
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,669
Going in.

1307
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:05,529
The transition is crazy.

1308
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:07,800
(Following it)

1309
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:09,140
I love it.

1310
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:13,610
The sand flying. That's so cool.

1311
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:19,709
(Tasmanian devil)

1312
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,020
It's wild.

1313
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:26,420
It's crazy.

1314
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:28,260
So cool.

1315
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:34,600
We got that high-angle.

1316
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:37,070
AG. Okay.

1317
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:41,939
Come on, AG.

1318
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,439
Let's go!

1319
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,870
Let's go!

1320
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:49,910
Nice!

1321
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:57,990
They've got the whole Australian community.

1322
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,690
Period!

1323
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,860
This part is so fun.

1324
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:08,760
Period!

1325
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:13,230
That's fire.

1326
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:15,840
Go!

1327
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:22,140
Yes!

1328
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:34,760
Good job, ladies.

1329
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,890
- It's so wild. - The last scene was cool.

1330
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:41,130
I'm not upset, even though they tore up our flag.

1331
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,830
- Sorry about your flags. - Sorry, guys.

1332
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:46,269
I'll take the disrespect as it was fire.

1333
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:47,999
- I'll take it. - Cool.

1334
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,210
They did an amazing job.

1335
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:52,609
It's not easy to make each one of them stand out.

1336
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:53,610
I know.

1337
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,209
(Respect)

1338
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:58,549
(Lost in words)

1339
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:00,980
The direction is crazy.

1340
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:03,019
The quality is too high.

1341
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:05,190
It doesn't look like a dance competition.

1342
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:07,989
It's more like a music video competition.

1343
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:09,090
For sure.

1344
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:15,159
Among the fight judges' scores, the directing score,

1345
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,970
which was revealed earlier, is 270 points.

1346
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,869
Then, what scores did the fight judges...

1347
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:21,969
give for the rest of the criteria?

1348
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:24,710
We're going to reveal the final fight judges' score...

1349
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:28,079
for AG SQUAD's Mega Crew Mission.

1350
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:31,250
She caught the boomerang in the beginning. That was...

1351
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,719
It encompassed everything.

1352
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,219
That was a genius idea.

1353
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:39,619
- Yes. - When the scene where Danica...

1354
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:41,259
had a snake on her zoomed out, it gave me goosebumps.

1355
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:43,159
During the group choreography using the arms,

1356
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,829
the branches and the arms...

1357
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:48,759
blended, and I think that was really clever.

1358
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,629
Choosing the background that goes with the choreography...

1359
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:52,100
is also an ability.

1360
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:55,669
AG SQUAD's was like nature.

1361
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:57,209
You have crazy animals.

1362
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:59,739
They're showing all these different aspects.

1363
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:01,009
So in that way, I think...

1364
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:02,909
they represented their identity very well.

1365
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:04,879
But the dancing was disappointing.

1366
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,179
The directing and the cinematography were outstanding.

1367
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:12,789
But the choreography didn't seem so detailed.

1368
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:15,390
It didn't feel very well-organized.

1369
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,260
This is difficult.

1370
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:20,960
The fight judges' scores will be revealed now.

1371
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:22,800
That would be the lowest, right?

1372
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:26,430
AG SQUAD might get a really high score in choreography.

1373
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:27,940
Look at their faces.

1374
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:30,200
Not smiling anymore, are we?

1375
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:31,970
(Feeling confident)

1376
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:33,910
I think we might get 100.

1377
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:36,309
I definitely think that...

1378
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:38,250
AG SQUAD will rank first.

1379
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:41,120
I'm certain we can win this time.

1380
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,420
(What?)

1381
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:47,320
(What score did AG SQUAD get?)

1382
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:53,089
(AG SQUAD received a lower score than OSAKA Ojo Gang's.)

1383
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,330
No way.

1384
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,430
That's too low.

1385
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:58,170
That's horrible.

1386
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:01,440
That's wild.

1387
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:05,509
The highest-scoring category out of the four...

1388
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:07,240
was directing,

1389
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,450
while the lowest was the high-angle challenge.

1390
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:14,180
I don't think the high-angle part stood out so much.

1391
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:16,989
It was nice that they made the letters AG,

1392
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:18,320
but it wasn't creative.

1393
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,589
The other parts were overwhelmingly cool,

1394
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:22,859
- but the high-angle wasn't. - That's right.

1395
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:24,690
- That was disappointing. - That's right.

1396
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,330
AG SQUAD's total score...

1397
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:30,970
is 960 out of 1,200.

1398
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:34,869
I agree with Mike Song because...

1399
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:38,739
I think the overall look and feel just didn't drive the point home.

1400
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:41,640
They would get hurt by this score.

1401
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:46,549
It is too low as we did expect it to be higher.

1402
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:51,590
So I hope that our likes help us bump up our score.

1403
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,789
The current first place for the fight judges' score...

1404
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:55,990
is OSAKA Ojo Gang.

1405
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,989
AG SQUAD is in second place...

1406
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:00,030
with 960.

1407
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,730
Next is Team Japan.

1408
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:08,399
The fight judges' score for RHTokyo will be revealed.

1409
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,599
- Let's see. - Yes!

1410
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,840
Let's go!

1411
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:13,170
I think they might get a high score.

1412
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:15,740
- The visuals were nice. - They had great cinematography.

1413
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:18,149
I'm not sure about the high-angle.

1414
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:19,780
(She's worried.)

1415
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:22,779
Out of the four categories,

1416
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:26,790
the fight judges' score for directing will be shown first.

1417
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,190
For directing?

1418
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:29,720
Please.

1419
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:32,089
I did my best in directing.

1420
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:35,560
I'm confident that it was a mega crew that no one's ever made.

1421
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:37,629
They had great directing skills.

1422
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:39,170
I think they'll get a really high score.

1423
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,600
I think they're going to get a perfect score.

1424
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,539
The fight judges would like it.

1425
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:46,369
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's Directing Score: 235)

1426
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:48,679
(AG SQUAD's Directing Score: 270)

1427
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:51,979
I think Rie Hata would have the most experience.

1428
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:54,449
Rie Hata has been directing...

1429
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:57,219
her crew all along.

1430
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:59,049
That's right. She's always a director.

1431
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:00,720
Among these groups,

1432
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:02,660
Rie Hata is the original.

1433
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:06,560
(What's RHTokyo's directing score?)

1434
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,330
One hundred points.

1435
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:13,200
They received a full score.

1436
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:16,840
- I agree with this. - I really agree.

1437
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:19,370
Now,

1438
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:23,640
we will watch RHTokyo's mega crew performance video.

1439
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:27,479
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1440
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,319
Let's go to Japan!

1441
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,990
Let's go to Tokyo!

1442
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:34,159
The video serves as evidence...

1443
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,819
that RH Tokyo is the team that represents Japan.

1444
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:38,659
I am really proud of it.

1445
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:39,790
I'm confident.

1446
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:43,829
(Tokyo, Japan)

1447
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:47,840
We really came to Shibuya.

1448
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:51,770
Where do you think of when we say Tokyo?

1449
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:52,910
Shibuya.

1450
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:57,149
The mission is to express your national identity.

1451
01:02:57,150 --> 01:03:00,079
So I want to use Shibuya Scramble Crossing,

1452
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,680
which represents Tokyo.

1453
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,849
(During the Mega Crew Mission meeting.)

1454
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:05,020
What would be good?

1455
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:06,749
(Thinking)

1456
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:08,220
The national story?

1457
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:11,589
If you connect it with Real Hot Tokyo,

1458
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:12,660
maybe hot springs?

1459
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:14,959
(A really hot concept?)

1460
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,929
Or Shibuya Scramble Crossing.

1461
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:18,429
I think that place would be nice.

1462
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:20,799
Neon lights would be nice.

1463
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,970
You talked about neon.

1464
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:26,410
Rapid development is also Japan's strength.

1465
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:30,379
"Things that do not change" and "things that keep changing."

1466
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:32,349
Giving both of them importance.

1467
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,980
I think we could make a story from there.

1468
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:38,489
When you hear the name, Real Hot Tokyo,

1469
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:40,919
it gives you a hot and cool image.

1470
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,619
I want to look at that in a more critical way,

1471
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:46,190
and think about what Japan is like in reality.

1472
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,959
We were born in the Heisei era.

1473
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,669
At that time, Japan was a society where everyone had to be the same,

1474
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:55,569
unusual dances were disliked,

1475
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:59,770
and people were expected to follow the rules.

1476
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:02,909
How we found our individuality within that environment...

1477
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:05,679
and became free in the Reiwa era.

1478
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,819
I wanted to create a story...

1479
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:09,950
based on what we've experienced.

1480
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,349
Next,

1481
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:14,560
let's talk about what music we'll use.

1482
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:16,659
Wouldn't it be nice to use a Japanese artist's song?

1483
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:17,860
Chiba Yuki.

1484
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:24,429
Chiba Yuki is an artist who's very closely connected to us.

1485
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:25,699
There's a song called "Mamushi."

1486
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:27,639
(Singing)

1487
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,399
The choreographer is here.

1488
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,500
(I'm the choreographer.)

1489
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:34,779
In expressing our national identity,

1490
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:39,179
I thought it could be exciting to collaborate,

1491
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:41,720
so I called him for help.

1492
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:44,419
(Chiba Yuki's studio)

1493
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:49,060
He said he would do it for World of Street Woman Fighter.

1494
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:54,260
And we had the music that Chiba Yuki made.

1495
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:55,959
("APPARE")

1496
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,930
(Speechless)

1497
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,699
(Appare: Something so amazing it makes your eyes open)

1498
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:03,070
I was really excited.

1499
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:07,309
(RHTokyo hears the song for the first time.)

1500
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:08,709
(This is exciting.)

1501
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:10,479
(There's a variation section as well.)

1502
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,110
This is awesome.

1503
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:16,379
All the members said it was really nice.

1504
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:19,250
That gave me motivation.

1505
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,589
The first half of "APPARE..."

1506
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:25,359
will express the real feeling...

1507
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:26,589
of Japan after we were born.

1508
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:29,459
We wanted to show Tokyo as much as we could.

1509
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,699
We chose many locations too.

1510
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:34,069
Places that remind you of Japan from our childhood.

1511
01:05:34,070 --> 01:05:36,169
(Produce store, school, )

1512
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:37,969
(game center, subway)

1513
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:41,180
Everyone could do the dance.

1514
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:44,779
A Tokyo-like move...

1515
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:47,179
that would also have been done in the past.

1516
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:49,749
That is shown in the first half.

1517
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:51,849
And the second half is like the future.

1518
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:53,649
Like neon Tokyo.

1519
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:56,059
I wanted to express...

1520
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:57,360
a style that could display more individuality.

1521
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,030
Let's do it.

1522
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,660
RHTokyo is here.

1523
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,299
(All the members joined the mega crew.)

1524
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:07,799
Rie's student.

1525
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:10,099
Student's student's student's student.

1526
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:11,540
I have great-grandchildren.

1527
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:14,539
These are my students,

1528
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:17,039
and they are Mona's students.

1529
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:19,310
We are each in the corner.

1530
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:23,079
(Rico's students flew in from Osaka.)

1531
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,349
They are Rie Hata kids.

1532
01:06:25,350 --> 01:06:27,560
(There's a camera.)

1533
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,629
I wanted to show the genius children to the world,

1534
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:34,559
so you will all be in the mega crew video!

1535
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:35,829
(Make some noise!)

1536
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:38,529
I wanted to show various stories,

1537
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:40,869
so we needed many people.

1538
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:43,739
The dancers will be divided into each scene.

1539
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:47,679
I hadn't seen such a mega crew.

1540
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:51,180
So I made this mega crew with a new meaning.

1541
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,449
(Rie Kids start with stretching.)

1542
01:06:54,450 --> 01:06:56,679
(Singing)

1543
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,519
Skill accounts for ten percent.

1544
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,249
- Skill accounts for 10 percent. - Skill accounts for 10 percent.

1545
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:02,019
Expression accounts for 90.

1546
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:04,019
- Expression accounts for 90. - Expression accounts for 90.

1547
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:08,329
If there are many people, everyone will become robots.

1548
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:12,269
So I wanted to make a video with passion...

1549
01:07:12,270 --> 01:07:16,070
where the children wouldn't just do what they were taught.

1550
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:21,379
From little kids dancers to adult dancers.

1551
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:24,349
Children who try to shine in Japan.

1552
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:29,420
They're all young people trying to lead Japan forward.

1553
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:31,920
That's the message it has.

1554
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:37,489
These children memorized the choreography in one hour.

1555
01:07:37,490 --> 01:07:38,889
Should we show it properly tomorrow?

1556
01:07:38,890 --> 01:07:42,059
- RHTokyo! - RHTokyo!

1557
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:45,930
- See you tomorrow. Bye. - Bye.

1558
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:48,069
(Mega Crew filming day)

1559
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:49,540
Where are we in Tokyo?

1560
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:52,340
It's a game center before its opening time.

1561
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:55,609
It was a tight schedule,

1562
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:58,050
trying to film at many locations in one day.

1563
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:00,079
(Heisei girl)

1564
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:03,120
The scene with the three. We'll start with the intro.

1565
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:04,719
Cute.

1566
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:08,119
It wasn't my part, so I stepped back...

1567
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:11,090
and did my best directing.

1568
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:12,360
Move it up.

1569
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:15,829
I wanted to make something fun.

1570
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:17,100
Should we add some steps too?

1571
01:08:17,530 --> 01:08:19,099
(She's passionate.)

1572
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,739
(They hit it above like they learned.)

1573
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:23,199
Amazing.

1574
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,809
(She's satisfied.)

1575
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:28,579
Next is the train platform scene...

1576
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:30,980
in which Rena and Asuka are the main dancers.

1577
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:32,410
We're moving with Kenta.

1578
01:08:32,610 --> 01:08:36,579
(The train scene around office workers of the past.)

1579
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:40,390
We have the students of Rena's and Asuka's.

1580
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:44,260
The concept is an office lady in the Heisei era.

1581
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,730
The outfits for the train scene...

1582
01:08:46,830 --> 01:08:49,900
was lent to us by Rie.

1583
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,600
Clothes that were worn in the bubble era.

1584
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:53,630
It's hard to find those.

1585
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:56,869
"Wear this, Rena. Wear this, Asuka."

1586
01:08:56,870 --> 01:09:00,240
Many of the clothes came out of my wardrobe.

1587
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:03,539
Rie is capable of styling, working the camera,

1588
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:06,180
and directing.

1589
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:09,649
Let's match the timing when the train comes in.

1590
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:10,949
One shot, one kill!

1591
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:12,119
(Rie calculates the timing when the train comes in.)

1592
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:16,159
Rie's directing abilities...

1593
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,560
are really genius.

1594
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:19,859
After directing the train station scene,

1595
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:21,760
next was the produce store scene.

1596
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:24,530
We're dressed in 90s fashion.

1597
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:28,199
Have you seen us in this style?

1598
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:29,200
Have you?

1599
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,409
I'm sorry. I'll do this quickly.

1600
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:34,279
We tried not to be an inconvenience on the street.

1601
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:36,839
We made way when there were people riding bicycles.

1602
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:37,980
You can pass through.

1603
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:41,520
We talked to the old man there.

1604
01:09:41,850 --> 01:09:44,949
I didn't want to leave a bad image of dancers.

1605
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:47,520
So I directed quickly with that in mind.

1606
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:51,659
Rie has a great ability to attract people.

1607
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:55,200
I really respect that and thank her.

1608
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:58,699
Mona and Reina's shooting...

1609
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:00,469
is done.

1610
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:01,769
Yes.

1611
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:04,909
I will be shooting now as well, so I'll cool my face with a mask.

1612
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:08,010
I'll bring down the puffiness and get makeup.

1613
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:11,180
I came to the school.

1614
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:12,750
Hello.

1615
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:16,319
I personally like the school scene.

1616
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:19,750
It really feels like Japan.

1617
01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:22,519
There is a teacher, there are desks,

1618
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:26,259
there are children in narrow corridors.

1619
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:29,160
I think you could feel nostalgic.

1620
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:33,100
All the children are studying at their desks,

1621
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:37,610
and they suddenly dance so well. It's like a fantasy.

1622
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:42,480
I really like the scene because of such dreamlike elements.

1623
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:46,809
Thank you for your work since morning!

1624
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:48,620
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1625
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:51,489
We still have one day left,

1626
01:10:51,490 --> 01:10:53,450
so let's practice hard and do our best!

1627
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:55,360
(The filming for the past Japan ends.)

1628
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:57,260
Hello.

1629
01:10:57,690 --> 01:11:00,190
We're at Shibuya Scramble Crossing.

1630
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:02,899
(There's a green wall surrounding the crossing.)

1631
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:07,230
It's like we borrowed the Shibuya Scramble Crossing.

1632
01:11:08,770 --> 01:11:10,469
(The second half will reflect the future Japan.)

1633
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:13,370
The high-angle in the Mega Crew Mission...

1634
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:16,140
will be filmed at the Shibuya Scramble Crossing.

1635
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,579
We tried many things...

1636
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:20,080
since it's hard to film there.

1637
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:21,619
I called the police.

1638
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:23,150
I called the mayor.

1639
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:29,359
(They arranged a set that replicated the crossing perfectly through CGI.)

1640
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:33,859
The scenes where Chiba Yuki and RHTokyo walk out...

1641
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:35,830
were filmed at the actual Shibuya Scramble Crossing.

1642
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,329
(They all enter the Scramble Crossing.)

1643
01:11:38,330 --> 01:11:40,229
(The day of the crossing scene)

1644
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:41,570
It really looks like Shibuya.

1645
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:43,700
It was amazing.

1646
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,640
We also have a special artist.

1647
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:49,709
(Sota)

1648
01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:51,880
Sota came!

1649
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:56,149
Sota is a member of BE: FIRST,

1650
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:58,549
one of the top Japanese groups.

1651
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:00,089
(It's nice to meet you.)

1652
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:02,719
Sota is outstanding in dance.

1653
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:06,030
I called him because I thought he couldn't be left out.

1654
01:12:07,630 --> 01:12:09,230
I look forward to it.

1655
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:15,469
(The rehearsal for the high-angle section starts.)

1656
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:18,139
The high-angle scene...

1657
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:21,240
had around 100 people. There were many dancers.

1658
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:24,079
The first half...

1659
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,410
had a retro style.

1660
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:32,249
In the latter half, we wanted to use vibrant colors...

1661
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:34,360
to express modernity, the future, and the sense of individuality.

1662
01:12:35,190 --> 01:12:37,490
The colors could be seen well even from afar.

1663
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:39,190
So I thought, "We should use umbrellas!"

1664
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:44,260
(RHTokyo rehearses the umbrella choreography scene.)

1665
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:45,970
Is this the right timing?

1666
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:49,840
(The umbrellas open at different times.)

1667
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:55,309
(They lack umbrellas...)

1668
01:12:55,310 --> 01:12:58,249
(because some got damaged.)

1669
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:59,810
We don't have green umbrellas, right?

1670
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:02,620
Do we have more umbrellas?

1671
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:04,320
We don't have more.

1672
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:06,990
(We have no umbrellas.)

1673
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:08,520
I'm not sure. Does it look okay?

1674
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:11,790
It was really tough. I don't even want to remember it.

1675
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:13,959
The umbrellas we ordered didn't arrive,

1676
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,400
so we practiced using transparent umbrellas.

1677
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:17,830
(The umbrella timing was difficult during practice.)

1678
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:19,469
They didn't sleep well,

1679
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:22,300
and they didn't know what color the umbrellas were.

1680
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:26,210
I created it while imagining what wasn't there.

1681
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:28,540
I felt dizzy.

1682
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:32,250
But we couldn't film after sunset.

1683
01:13:32,410 --> 01:13:33,650
We had about six hours.

1684
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,420
It will be dark after five minutes.

1685
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:38,619
We had limited time.

1686
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:40,790
We just had to do it.

1687
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:44,219
But everyone focused really hard.

1688
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:46,929
I really thank RHTokyo for that.

1689
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:49,330
I'm grateful they were there.

1690
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,769
Thank you for the unforgettable memory.

1691
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:54,030
Well done!

1692
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:56,169
I feel like crying seeing everyone here.

1693
01:13:56,170 --> 01:13:57,540
We did everything we could.

1694
01:13:58,570 --> 01:14:00,239
RHTokyo!

1695
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:01,240
(How did RHTokyo's Mega Crew video turn out?)

1696
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,439
(Awesome! Tokyo! Japanese!)

1697
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,579
(Director: Rie Hata)

1698
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:06,749
(From the Heisei era Japan to the future Japan we will build)

1699
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:07,850
(A modern age of individuality led by RHTokyo, driving the flow)

1700
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:10,750
Good morning.

1701
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:13,950
This makes me laugh.

1702
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:17,020
It's so funny. She's so creative.

1703
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:19,890
Good morning.

1704
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:21,830
Breaking news.

1705
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:25,700
We received positive news in Heisei Japan.

1706
01:14:25,970 --> 01:14:28,440
The Japanese talents are making an incredible impact.

1707
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:30,740
Seeing it again after a while really lifts my spirits.

1708
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:31,970
I love it.

1709
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:37,339
They filmed a movie.

1710
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:38,950
The aesthetics are crazy.

1711
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:40,510
Fire.

1712
01:14:42,050 --> 01:14:43,149
Come on.

1713
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:44,220
The subway.

1714
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:48,090
School.

1715
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:53,189
(A dance craze that makes you copy it)

1716
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:55,430
- Everyone is doing it. - Except for Ojo Gang.

1717
01:14:57,870 --> 01:14:59,929
How did they come up with this move?

1718
01:14:59,930 --> 01:15:02,200
It's so simple but crazy.

1719
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:13,950
- With the youth. - So cute.

1720
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:16,350
Look at the kids. Look at the faces.

1721
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:20,090
The children are amazing.

1722
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:23,420
Nina.

1723
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:24,960
I love that part.

1724
01:15:26,430 --> 01:15:27,789
And good transition.

1725
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:29,629
The flow is crazy.

1726
01:15:29,630 --> 01:15:30,860
The directing is really good.

1727
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:33,269
Goodness. This is the duo we needed.

1728
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:35,040
They dance well together.

1729
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:38,010
(Mona and Reina's chemistry)

1730
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:40,440
Their wigs are cool.

1731
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:44,410
The body rolls. I love it.

1732
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:49,250
Is the fashion representing The Oranges?

1733
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,019
I love the fashion.

1734
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:52,950
- That's really crazy. - Come on.

1735
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,390
How do you move like that?

1736
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:02,760
Not mom.

1737
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:04,729
Not the older sister.

1738
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:05,830
(Only appare)

1739
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:07,130
The kids.

1740
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,040
Fire.

1741
01:16:17,041 --> 01:16:18,880
(Let's go.)

1742
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:21,480
The time is now.

1743
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:24,620
(It's Chiba Yuki.)

1744
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:28,019
Come on.

1745
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:29,020
He's acting.

1746
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:30,860
It's like a movie.

1747
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:32,660
I love the walking.

1748
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:34,160
Gosh.

1749
01:16:37,970 --> 01:16:39,600
(Focused)

1750
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:41,070
This is crazy.

1751
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:46,369
This is crazy.

1752
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:48,240
This part is crazy!

1753
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:52,950
The groove is really...

1754
01:16:53,950 --> 01:16:55,420
They're really amazing.

1755
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:57,880
Come on.

1756
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:01,960
Some of the umbrellas didn't open well.

1757
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:04,660
This was hard.

1758
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,960
It was hard opening the umbrellas.

1759
01:17:07,630 --> 01:17:08,730
Good luck.

1760
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:15,039
- It's... You get a bit lost. - Yes.

1761
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,140
Until here.

1762
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:17,740
This is my favorite part.

1763
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:20,539
- Great! - Fire.

1764
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:21,709
(Me too.)

1765
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:23,280
- Great! - Okay.

1766
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,310
It's moving really quickly.

1767
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:28,919
Go on, Sota!

1768
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,619
The rhythm is crazy.

1769
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:32,650
Is it showing how individuality is spreading?

1770
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:35,860
That's cool.

1771
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:40,559
The pictures that they're creating right now... All these angles...

1772
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,200
It's really awesome.

1773
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,740
He's so good at dancing. So good.

1774
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,569
This is giving a mega vibe.

1775
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:51,940
Yes. Mega crew.

1776
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,210
What?

1777
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:02,750
- It's like the final shot, right? - Yes.

1778
01:18:04,650 --> 01:18:06,120
The video is crazy.

1779
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:08,060
I hope you have a wonderful day.

1780
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:18,700
So cute.

1781
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,330
It's so strong.

1782
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,970
They really made a music video.

1783
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:24,810
The directing was really great.

1784
01:18:25,570 --> 01:18:27,070
- Goosebumps? - Goosebumps.

1785
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:29,040
It's still cool no matter how many times I watch it.

1786
01:18:29,510 --> 01:18:33,350
It's nice that you can laugh and even forget about talking.

1787
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:37,420
It captured so many iconic aspects of Japan.

1788
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:40,020
From the subway to this street.

1789
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:42,590
Girls who are taking sticker photos.

1790
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,619
Shibuya Scramble, right?

1791
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:46,629
The most iconic...

1792
01:18:46,630 --> 01:18:49,199
One of the most Japanese things.

1793
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:50,929
And it's so Japanese.

1794
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:51,930
- Right. - Right?

1795
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:54,029
It just has Rie Hata's style.

1796
01:18:54,030 --> 01:18:55,999
The rhythm and groove.

1797
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,640
You just get drawn by this.

1798
01:18:58,070 --> 01:18:59,709
They made the music as well.

1799
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:01,340
It's a real fly song.

1800
01:19:03,610 --> 01:19:07,479
Every scene has a meaning.

1801
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:10,119
Every single dancer...

1802
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,120
is dope.

1803
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:12,620
That's detail.

1804
01:19:12,990 --> 01:19:14,750
High-level direction.

1805
01:19:15,390 --> 01:19:17,489
First of all, this is really high-quality.

1806
01:19:17,490 --> 01:19:19,829
How did they come up with this move?

1807
01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:23,030
I felt the thrill when it continued in the next scene.

1808
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:26,430
But it's such a loss for this mission.

1809
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:28,270
The choreography should stand out.

1810
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:30,899
But there are so many elements.

1811
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,639
That would be a loss for them.

1812
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,240
It's a double-edged sword.

1813
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:37,610
You have to be visually overwhelming.

1814
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:40,779
You make stunning formations...

1815
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:43,349
and the dominoes.

1816
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:45,149
But the choreography was weak...

1817
01:19:45,150 --> 01:19:47,349
in the scenes with everyone.

1818
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:50,789
It wasn't a performance you could show as a mega crew.

1819
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:54,059
There's a certain anticipation tied to the word "mega crew."

1820
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:55,699
This is so difficult.

1821
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:56,799
(What is the fight judges' score?)

1822
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,530
Among the scores that were revealed earlier,

1823
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:03,640
the directing score was 275 points.

1824
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:05,539
Mega Crew Mission.

1825
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:09,680
What will be the final fight judges' score for RHTokyo?

1826
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:12,350
The scores will be revealed now.

1827
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:14,679
The video serves as evidence...

1828
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:17,479
that RHTokyo is the team that represents Japan.

1829
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:19,390
I'm confident.

1830
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:22,360
We don't need two crews representing Japan.

1831
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:25,060
I think they'd get more than 1,005 points.

1832
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:26,830
We'll take the chance.

1833
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:31,399
We already knew the number of views.

1834
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:35,000
So I was curious about the fight judges' score.

1835
01:20:42,410 --> 01:20:43,410
We're winning.

1836
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,450
(Surprised)

1837
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,450
RHTokyo's Mega Crew Mission.

1838
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:55,060
The total score is 1,065.

1839
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:57,360
Sixty points.

1840
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,259
Gosh, that is a high score.

1841
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:02,560
They're not going home.

1842
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:05,270
We came here to win.

1843
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:07,270
We have many 100 points.

1844
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:11,140
Lia Kim said the national identity score was 100.

1845
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:13,769
It's amazing that the national identity score is high.

1846
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:15,510
The high-angle score is very low.

1847
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,840
She gave them 60.

1848
01:21:18,410 --> 01:21:19,880
Lia Kim is strict.

1849
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:23,979
There are parts that are not very refined.

1850
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:26,649
Why does it lack two green umbrellas there?

1851
01:21:26,650 --> 01:21:28,790
That stands out so much.

1852
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:33,459
Timing the opening of the umbrella was really difficult.

1853
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:36,359
I think there were risks.

1854
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:39,429
Regarding the high-angle,

1855
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:42,739
I also think we lacked...

1856
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:47,770
the time and effort.

1857
01:21:48,110 --> 01:21:49,410
I reflected on it.

1858
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:51,340
She admits.

1859
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:55,979
The likes were 100 points apart.

1860
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:58,420
If it's like that again, that doesn't even matter.

1861
01:21:58,790 --> 01:22:01,449
The crew in first place in terms of scores...

1862
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:03,160
is RHTokyo.

1863
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:11,529
Next is Team USA's MOTIV.

1864
01:22:11,530 --> 01:22:14,230
Their fight judges' score will be revealed.

1865
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,970
The nerves. The sweat.

1866
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:20,739
MOTIV's leader, Marlee.

1867
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:23,509
She put a lot of thought into representing the US,

1868
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:25,549
the birthplace of hip-hop.

1869
01:22:25,550 --> 01:22:28,210
Please let us know if there are highlights we shouldn't miss.

1870
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:31,249
I wanted to highlight diversity.

1871
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:35,059
Amid the division that is happening in America,

1872
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:38,890
we actually are unified. We're fighting together against that.

1873
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:41,260
(Title: "We The People")

1874
01:22:41,261 --> 01:22:43,629
"We The People?" That's the American spirit.

1875
01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:45,169
"We The People" has done everything.

1876
01:22:45,170 --> 01:22:46,829
The intention is clear.

1877
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:49,769
Will they present it in the same old way we know,

1878
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:52,509
or will they present it in an unpredictable way?

1879
01:22:52,510 --> 01:22:53,569
That might be the only difference.

1880
01:22:53,570 --> 01:22:54,739
That's very important.

1881
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:56,040
The one-line summary is really nice.

1882
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:02,849
I'm excited to go home,

1883
01:23:02,850 --> 01:23:05,349
go back to my dance family.

1884
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:07,649
A lot of the people who are going to do this with me...

1885
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:09,560
also just know my process.

1886
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:13,190
This Mega Crew Mission is the mission for MOTIV crew.

1887
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:16,259
Because MOTIV crew actually is a mega crew.

1888
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:18,299
Our crew back at home is 30 people.

1889
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:22,200
So every performance we do is a mega crew performance.

1890
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:23,839
I'm really confident.

1891
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:27,010
I know we're going to do really well with this challenge.

1892
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:29,809
(The day the mega crew video was out and they watched it with the fans)

1893
01:23:29,810 --> 01:23:33,610
(MOTIV is crying while watching the video?)

1894
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:39,090
(What happened to MOTIV during the Mega Crew Mission?)

1895
01:23:39,690 --> 01:23:41,919
The main thing that spoke out to me is that...

1896
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,789
every team represents their country.

1897
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:47,429
Think of America. There are a lot of great things.

1898
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:50,959
But then, there is also a lot of stuff happening politically.

1899
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,700
Minorities in a lot of situations.

1900
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,439
To represent America honestly,

1901
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:59,869
especially if we're talking about hip-hop...

1902
01:23:59,870 --> 01:24:02,509
The hip-hop music and culture...

1903
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:05,079
is all about resistance and rebellion.

1904
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:08,179
And it was created by the people that suffer...

1905
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:11,619
at the hands of the political climate of America.

1906
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:15,019
So to use hip-hop as the art form...

1907
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:17,559
but then to just make it happy-go-lucky?

1908
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:19,129
This wouldn't make any sense.

1909
01:24:19,130 --> 01:24:20,759
We want to represent...

1910
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,729
hip-hop in the USA.

1911
01:24:22,730 --> 01:24:24,859
So we do want there to be some depth...

1912
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:26,899
- Yes. - to the piece.

1913
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:28,799
I have reference songs.

1914
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,369
(MOTIV plays the reference songs for the producers.)

1915
01:24:31,370 --> 01:24:33,409
Rather than being mainstream,

1916
01:24:33,410 --> 01:24:35,739
it has to be deep and groovy.

1917
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:36,909
- Yes. Very. - Yes.

1918
01:24:36,910 --> 01:24:39,949
More of the hip-hop, old-school...

1919
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:41,479
(They paid extra attention to add depth to the meaning.)

1920
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:44,249
The US is definitely a melting pot.

1921
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:46,689
MOTIV obviously is like a melting pot.

1922
01:24:46,690 --> 01:24:50,319
Hip-hop is supposed to be a diverse community...

1923
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,320
for everybody.

1924
01:24:51,321 --> 01:24:53,859
It was created by black and brown people,

1925
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:55,929
but hip-hop is for everybody.

1926
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:57,459
And we have Miyu.

1927
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:00,770
Everybody, we have to formally meet Miyu.

1928
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:03,969
She is one of our special guests.

1929
01:25:03,970 --> 01:25:06,410
World-renowned dancer and freestyler.

1930
01:25:06,570 --> 01:25:11,810
(Miyu, the dance prodigy dominating the battle scenes)

1931
01:25:12,350 --> 01:25:15,149
(She proved her talent on the global dance scene...)

1932
01:25:15,150 --> 01:25:17,750
(by winning even against adult competitors!)

1933
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:21,319
We're here!

1934
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:23,059
She said when she was really little,

1935
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:24,959
she watched Street Woman Fighter,

1936
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,829
and that's when she told her mom,

1937
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:28,499
"I want to start going to battles."

1938
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:31,559
Because she saw the girls battle on Street Woman Fighter.

1939
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:35,569
Miyu, a child, reminding us, the adults,

1940
01:25:35,570 --> 01:25:38,770
that hip-hop and dance are rooted in joy.

1941
01:25:39,470 --> 01:25:41,739
Day one. We're on our way to the set!

1942
01:25:41,740 --> 01:25:43,180
(It's exciting!)

1943
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:47,949
It's really rare that dancers get the opportunity...

1944
01:25:47,950 --> 01:25:51,319
and the resources to create a video like this.

1945
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:54,349
And it's something so beautiful to have a vision in your brain...

1946
01:25:54,350 --> 01:25:55,890
and then to see it in real life.

1947
01:25:56,390 --> 01:25:59,529
So many people came together to make this what it was.

1948
01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:01,929
So I'm just grateful for all of their time.

1949
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:03,359
It's like magic.

1950
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,199
And I want it to remain far.

1951
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:09,039
I also think that we have a deep responsibility.

1952
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,240
Once we join in with...

1953
01:26:10,570 --> 01:26:13,409
Okay, so basically, I made a storyboard.

1954
01:26:13,410 --> 01:26:15,340
So Marlee prepared these?

1955
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:17,179
- Yes. - Great.

1956
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:18,280
(She planned and prepared everything herself.)

1957
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:20,179
(She checks everything on set and manages the entire production.)

1958
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:22,549
You know what I think it is? It's about remaining lower.

1959
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:25,619
One, two, three, four, down, five...

1960
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:28,760
(The shoot runs smoothly under Marlee's direction.)

1961
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:32,260
I love how Marlee works. I love her vision.

1962
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:35,799
We just stuck to red, white, and blue to represent the flag.

1963
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:38,099
And then we used those different colors...

1964
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:40,899
to represent different aspects of our story.

1965
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:43,739
And then, as far as my other special guests,

1966
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:46,469
all of the freestylers in the battle scene...

1967
01:26:46,470 --> 01:26:49,079
I have battled against,

1968
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:50,780
which I think is really special.

1969
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:55,319
And then I wanted a creative way of showcasing the title,

1970
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,119
which is "We The People."

1971
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:01,319
The beginning phrase of the American Constitution.

1972
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:05,159
We want to really showcase the unity and the diversity...

1973
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:08,060
that America truly represents.

1974
01:27:08,530 --> 01:27:12,129
We can connect through dance, we can connect through culture,

1975
01:27:12,130 --> 01:27:13,870
and hip-hop is the connection.

1976
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:17,599
- What's your MOTIV? - What's your MOTIV?

1977
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,840
(What will the Mega Crew Mission of MOTIV united by hip-hop be like?)

1978
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:22,079
(MOTIV returned to Korea after the filming.)

1979
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:25,110
- Okay, we're back in Korea! - Yes!

1980
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:30,119
All right, guys. We're back in Korea!

1981
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,189
(We came back to this survival jungle.)

1982
01:27:32,190 --> 01:27:34,119
Back and better. Ready to win.

1983
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:36,489
I haven't even seen anybody, but I just know.

1984
01:27:36,490 --> 01:27:38,629
- I just know it's the best. - Period.

1985
01:27:38,630 --> 01:27:40,259
I think this deserves a toast.

1986
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:41,589
Celebration.

1987
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:44,399
- This deserves some drinks. - Correct.

1988
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:45,830
(Raise your glasses.)

1989
01:27:46,130 --> 01:27:48,069
- We've got pineapple. - Okay.

1990
01:27:48,070 --> 01:27:50,599
- I want an apple. - Okay. Apple.

1991
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:53,169
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1992
01:27:53,170 --> 01:27:54,539
This is zero sugar,

1993
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:55,739
but it tastes really good.

1994
01:27:55,740 --> 01:27:57,139
- Delicious. - It's so good.

1995
01:27:57,140 --> 01:27:59,749
It's the same intensity we're going to bring on that dance floor.

1996
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:00,810
Yes!

1997
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:03,049
I can't wait for others to see ours.

1998
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:04,650
(What will their intense mega crew video look like?)

1999
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:07,489
- Let's watch. - I think it's hip-hop.

2000
01:28:07,490 --> 01:28:09,489
That feels like America.

2001
01:28:09,490 --> 01:28:11,189
Is that a battle concept?

2002
01:28:11,190 --> 01:28:13,029
It really captured the culture.

2003
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:16,159
The diversity of races makes it feel American.

2004
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:17,700
National identity?

2005
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:19,569
- America took the tea. - Yes.

2006
01:28:19,570 --> 01:28:21,669
It's expressing the diversity...

2007
01:28:21,670 --> 01:28:23,369
you can't feel unless you live in America.

2008
01:28:23,370 --> 01:28:25,099
That's something only that crew can do.

2009
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:26,239
- The American crew. - That's right.

2010
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:28,639
It does feel like...

2011
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:31,579
it's presenting the American hip-hop culture.

2012
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:33,579
When you think in terms of the mega crew aspect,

2013
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:35,419
it didn't have what it needed.

2014
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:38,619
There are only 46 dancers?

2015
01:28:38,620 --> 01:28:39,989
How many dancers do we have?

2016
01:28:39,990 --> 01:28:41,149
One hundred thirty.

2017
01:28:41,150 --> 01:28:42,260
Total number of dancers...

2018
01:28:42,690 --> 01:28:44,790
Guys, that means we have the least amount.

2019
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:46,160
Everyone has double.

2020
01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:47,959
(The high-angle section needs to be impactful.)

2021
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:49,829
Unexpectedly, there are only a few dancers.

2022
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:50,830
It's boring.

2023
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:54,269
The high-angle section wasn't as pleasing as I thought it'd be.

2024
01:28:54,270 --> 01:28:55,969
(The other 4 crews used many dancers and equipment...)

2025
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:57,639
(to make the high-angle section impactful.)

2026
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:59,369
How should I say it? Other crews showed...

2027
01:28:59,370 --> 01:29:02,179
superficial aspects such as the scene composition...

2028
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:04,039
and such.

2029
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,180
But it looks like MOTIV didn't put much care into the appearance.

2030
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:08,049
The core of the video didn't lie in the dance.

2031
01:29:08,050 --> 01:29:10,379
I got the sense that they wanted to deliver a message properly.

2032
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:12,919
Energy-wise, it was like this.

2033
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:14,949
- Yes. - The video doesn't give off...

2034
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:16,959
their determination to win.

2035
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:19,760
At this point, I didn't feel it.

2036
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:20,929
Gosh, kill me.

2037
01:29:20,930 --> 01:29:21,989
I'm still nervous.

2038
01:29:21,990 --> 01:29:23,600
I feel like I went into it thinking,

2039
01:29:24,130 --> 01:29:26,029
"No crew has anything on us."

2040
01:29:26,030 --> 01:29:27,799
"They're not touching us."

2041
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:29,469
Then I watched the videos and was like,

2042
01:29:29,470 --> 01:29:30,869
"Some people are doing some cool things,"

2043
01:29:30,870 --> 01:29:32,840
"and I didn't do that."

2044
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:35,840
So RHTokyo ranked us fourth.

2045
01:29:35,910 --> 01:29:40,109
"Prioritized messaging over visual impact."

2046
01:29:40,110 --> 01:29:41,249
BUMSUP ranked us fourth.

2047
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:43,149
"Lacking in impact."

2048
01:29:43,150 --> 01:29:45,220
OSAKA Ojo Gang ranked us fourth as well.

2049
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:48,019
"Didn't fully capture the mega scale."

2050
01:29:48,020 --> 01:29:49,219
We got second to last.

2051
01:29:49,220 --> 01:29:50,860
(Laughing)

2052
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:53,089
What makes me nervous the most is...

2053
01:29:53,090 --> 01:29:56,400
getting the least number of views and the least number of likes.

2054
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:58,299
I think we're going to battle.

2055
01:29:58,300 --> 01:29:59,630
(The leader makes a conscientious confession.)

2056
01:29:59,930 --> 01:30:01,699
We're not going to get the most views.

2057
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:04,040
We said that about the K-pop mission though.

2058
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:05,469
(Despite having the least number of views, )

2059
01:30:05,470 --> 01:30:06,610
(they beat OSAKA Ojo Gang with the number of likes.)

2060
01:30:06,710 --> 01:30:08,940
(MOTIV avoided the Elimination Battle.)

2061
01:30:09,110 --> 01:30:12,709
But that was in comparison to just OSAKA Ojo Gang.

2062
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:14,980
Let's say we weren't up against them.

2063
01:30:15,150 --> 01:30:17,820
We would've actually had to battle.

2064
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:20,490
Whatever. If we do have to battle, we'll battle whoever.

2065
01:30:22,820 --> 01:30:25,159
I don't expect us to battle...

2066
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:29,060
because I think people will resonate with our video.

2067
01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:33,769
Especially with the stuff that's going on literally right now,

2068
01:30:33,770 --> 01:30:36,670
people will really appreciate that we're speaking on it.

2069
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:38,640
It makes me proud to be a part of it.

2070
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:41,739
My pride to be a part of the video...

2071
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:44,709
surpasses any type of want for the views.

2072
01:30:44,710 --> 01:30:45,979
I really don't care.

2073
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:49,249
Of course, yes. It's for us in the show, but...

2074
01:30:49,250 --> 01:30:50,749
I love being a part of our video.

2075
01:30:50,750 --> 01:30:52,079
(Moved)

2076
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,320
I loved having you take part.

2077
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:59,259
I hope people who are watching, even if they're not from America,

2078
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:02,159
can feel and see the message.

2079
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:04,829
Because it was more important to be true to the art.

2080
01:31:04,830 --> 01:31:07,500
I just put my heart and soul into this video.

2081
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:10,570
I just hope the viewers feel that and see that.

2082
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:14,740
The fight judges' score for national identity...

2083
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:16,039
will be revealed first.

2084
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:18,379
They're just revealing the national identity score.

2085
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:21,250
- I think it'll be high. - Yes, I think it'll be high.

2086
01:31:21,710 --> 01:31:22,749
They expressed it very well.

2087
01:31:22,750 --> 01:31:24,479
(The highest national identity score is RHTokyo's 290 points.)

2088
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:25,719
I feel like...

2089
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:29,860
I can honestly see our video getting a really high score.

2090
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:31,519
Maybe the highest score.

2091
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:33,159
(I'm nervous.)

2092
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:35,899
(What's MOTIV's national identity score?)

2093
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:38,400
(Are you serious?)

2094
01:31:40,470 --> 01:31:41,470
(MOTIV's national identity score is 300 points.)

2095
01:31:41,471 --> 01:31:42,599
I knew it!

2096
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:46,010
I didn't know that Park Jin Young would give us 100. I had no clue.

2097
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:47,940
I'm so happy.

2098
01:31:48,010 --> 01:31:50,239
We represented America fully and totally.

2099
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:53,849
But seeing it actually in front of my eyes...

2100
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:56,250
was so gratifying.

2101
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:58,580
I could've just fallen over right then and there.

2102
01:31:58,650 --> 01:32:00,449
- That's incredible. - I know. That's incredible.

2103
01:32:00,450 --> 01:32:01,949
- I agree with the score. - I do too.

2104
01:32:01,950 --> 01:32:03,590
They deserve it. It was...

2105
01:32:03,790 --> 01:32:05,390
Now,

2106
01:32:06,030 --> 01:32:09,060
let's check out the Mega Crew Performance Video...

2107
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:10,260
by MOTIV.

2108
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,800
On a big screen! It's my first time.

2109
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:14,400
Let's go to the US.

2110
01:32:14,870 --> 01:32:16,240
I'm excited.

2111
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:20,209
("We The People," directed by Marlee)

2112
01:32:20,210 --> 01:32:21,569
(Concept: Through criticism, festival, and introspection, )

2113
01:32:21,570 --> 01:32:22,940
(this video shows that diversity is the truest aspect of the US.)

2114
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:33,420
Look at the beginning!

2115
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:35,050
Marlee is amazing.

2116
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:39,690
- Oh, my gosh! - That's insane.

2117
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:43,460
(We love it so much.)

2118
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:53,910
(100 percent absorbed)

2119
01:32:59,050 --> 01:33:00,410
I'm getting goosebumps again!

2120
01:33:03,820 --> 01:33:05,180
My gosh!

2121
01:33:06,020 --> 01:33:07,750
Logan!

2122
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:09,919
I love this. It's so cool.

2123
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:12,460
(Logistx is the best.)

2124
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:15,800
Her sense of presence is no joke.

2125
01:33:16,530 --> 01:33:17,860
I love it!

2126
01:33:19,870 --> 01:33:21,870
- It's cool. - I love it so much.

2127
01:33:23,540 --> 01:33:25,710
- It's cool. - It's insane.

2128
01:33:26,370 --> 01:33:27,370
They're really cool.

2129
01:33:27,870 --> 01:33:28,940
It's quite cool.

2130
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:30,740
Nice.

2131
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:32,350
It's like a commercial.

2132
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:38,480
I love this.

2133
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:41,450
- The lighting is really nice too. - Yes.

2134
01:33:41,550 --> 01:33:43,090
It puts the focus on the people.

2135
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:48,159
Does it show the battle culture?

2136
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,830
The battle represents the political conflicts.

2137
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:56,870
The dancers' facial expressions show their seriousness.

2138
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:59,609
It's so touching that they're trying to deliver a message.

2139
01:33:59,610 --> 01:34:01,710
- They filled it with stories. - Yes.

2140
01:34:02,070 --> 01:34:03,140
It's real hip-hop.

2141
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:05,749
Oh, my gosh.

2142
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:07,679
(Fantaye, let's go.)

2143
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:09,650
(Meanwhile, Fantaye becomes teary-eyed.)

2144
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:14,890
It's going to be a really nice way to show people...

2145
01:34:15,090 --> 01:34:18,520
that we take pride in from being America.

2146
01:34:18,690 --> 01:34:23,159
But also, we're not ignorant to the hardships...

2147
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:25,400
that come with living in America.

2148
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:33,140
Okay. Oh, my gosh.

2149
01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:34,540
Let's go, Miyu!

2150
01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:35,879
(Miyu's appearance makes him smile like a dad.)

2151
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:37,139
Miyu!

2152
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:38,410
(Proud)

2153
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:41,550
That must be why she's wearing a white outfit.

2154
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:44,879
- She's good. - Let's go!

2155
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,120
She's really good.

2156
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:48,050
- It's a party! - Let's go!

2157
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:50,619
Let's go!

2158
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:52,160
The music is amazing for this part.

2159
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:54,330
- It's so stylish. - Yes!

2160
01:34:54,890 --> 01:34:56,600
The cinematography is insane.

2161
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,830
- I love this part. It's insane. - Seriously.

2162
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:04,140
(Mike Song seems to be deep in thought.)

2163
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,709
This entire video...

2164
01:35:06,710 --> 01:35:10,179
is so close to our personal experiences,

2165
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:12,810
which is why the video itself is so personal.

2166
01:35:14,710 --> 01:35:17,079
I could watch this scene multiple times.

2167
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:18,620
- It's so nice. - Seriously.

2168
01:35:22,860 --> 01:35:24,890
This part draws you in.

2169
01:35:25,620 --> 01:35:28,130
Overall, there was...

2170
01:35:28,690 --> 01:35:30,430
an air of seriousness.

2171
01:35:31,230 --> 01:35:32,970
I might start crying again.

2172
01:35:33,570 --> 01:35:34,930
I feel like I'm going to cry each time.

2173
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:39,510
It was very deep. It moved me the most.

2174
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:44,780
I can feel their sincerity.

2175
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:48,779
It was definitely a video...

2176
01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:50,849
that showed the American identity...

2177
01:35:50,850 --> 01:35:53,389
with its muti-ethnic culture vividly.

2178
01:35:53,390 --> 01:35:57,159
It makes you think once more because MOTIV really showed...

2179
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:59,190
the current situation in the US.

2180
01:36:00,860 --> 01:36:02,599
Regardless of the mission,

2181
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:05,160
the video itself is valuable.

2182
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:07,130
That direction was so nice.

2183
01:36:07,430 --> 01:36:08,500
She's a genius.

2184
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:14,040
Only MOTIV can do such a thing.

2185
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:18,510
It's the epitome of the US.

2186
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:22,750
(Focused)

2187
01:36:23,050 --> 01:36:24,749
We could feel it better...

2188
01:36:24,750 --> 01:36:26,789
because the dancers were from the US.

2189
01:36:26,790 --> 01:36:28,150
It was very memorable.

2190
01:36:52,780 --> 01:36:54,050
I got goosebumps.

2191
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:57,380
(Amazed)

2192
01:36:58,650 --> 01:37:00,220
It was like a movie.

2193
01:37:00,690 --> 01:37:02,220
The storymaking was just...

2194
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:06,459
(They're still absorbed in the video.)

2195
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:07,559
The US.

2196
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:10,829
Even, like... No matter what happens, I think...

2197
01:37:10,830 --> 01:37:14,330
being able to represent the culture and represent the nation...

2198
01:37:14,530 --> 01:37:15,530
You did that.

2199
01:37:16,570 --> 01:37:18,440
Marlee is so good at directing.

2200
01:37:19,570 --> 01:37:21,809
They created that vibe in the studio.

2201
01:37:21,810 --> 01:37:23,439
They weren't outside. That's what impresses me.

2202
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:24,540
It's so impressive.

2203
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:27,750
- They're true artists. Amazing. - Amazing.

2204
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:31,850
Among the revealed fight judges' scores,

2205
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:34,620
the national identity score...

2206
01:37:34,690 --> 01:37:36,020
was 300 points.

2207
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:39,790
Now, I will reveal the final fight judges' score...

2208
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:43,030
for MOTIV's Mega Crew Mission.

2209
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:45,630
- I think it'll be high. - Yes, I think it'll be high.

2210
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:47,330
We need to think about the choreography too.

2211
01:37:47,870 --> 01:37:49,499
There were many walking and standing parts.

2212
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:52,170
- Do they count as choreography? - Yes. It was mostly storytelling.

2213
01:37:53,370 --> 01:37:55,140
- I'm scared. - Yes. Me too.

2214
01:37:56,380 --> 01:37:57,380
It's okay.

2215
01:37:58,610 --> 01:38:00,309
They made the choreography more relaxed,

2216
01:38:00,310 --> 01:38:02,680
but it felt like a bigger punch.

2217
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:06,819
In K-pop, we add so many movements...

2218
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:12,059
and try to make them intenser and stronger.

2219
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:14,359
- But they... - They stood still.

2220
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:16,860
They didn't add many details.

2221
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:21,030
In the high-angle section, they got up slowly.

2222
01:38:21,130 --> 01:38:22,769
That kind of relaxation...

2223
01:38:22,770 --> 01:38:24,300
makes no sense in K-pop.

2224
01:38:24,570 --> 01:38:27,740
But the stylishness that comes from that aspect...

2225
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:28,970
hit me hard.

2226
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:31,879
If you want to show the mega crew in a cool way...

2227
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:34,910
with the groovy and chill air, this is it.

2228
01:38:35,150 --> 01:38:37,679
But if I ignore what my heart felt...

2229
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:39,549
and judge the video based on what my eyes saw,

2230
01:38:39,550 --> 01:38:41,690
there wasn't any visual pleasure.

2231
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:44,259
- If we exclude the message... - The line. Yes.

2232
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:47,760
There wasn't much to see in terms of colors and lines.

2233
01:38:48,730 --> 01:38:51,560
Now, I will reveal the final fight judges' score...

2234
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:54,730
for MOTIV's Mega Crew Mission.

2235
01:38:55,970 --> 01:38:58,370
(Surprised)

2236
01:39:01,810 --> 01:39:03,510
(Their jaws drop.)

2237
01:39:07,950 --> 01:39:08,950
That's incredible.

2238
01:39:09,010 --> 01:39:10,550
They got so many 100s.

2239
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:12,250
The score is so high.

2240
01:39:17,090 --> 01:39:19,089
(Covering her mouth)

2241
01:39:19,090 --> 01:39:21,260
(Moved)

2242
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:23,830
(Marlee becomes speechless after checking the final score.)

2243
01:39:23,930 --> 01:39:25,329
(They deserved it.)

2244
01:39:25,330 --> 01:39:26,929
(They worked hard.)

2245
01:39:26,930 --> 01:39:28,929
They got the perfect score for the directing skills.

2246
01:39:28,930 --> 01:39:32,140
- All 100s for the directing skills. - That's insane.

2247
01:39:32,670 --> 01:39:34,640
Directing skills!

2248
01:39:35,270 --> 01:39:37,580
That's you.

2249
01:39:37,780 --> 01:39:39,110
I hope you recognize that.

2250
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:41,949
I'm confident in my directing skills,

2251
01:39:41,950 --> 01:39:44,079
and I feel like that's one of my strong suits.

2252
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:47,149
So to get that 100 from all of the judges...

2253
01:39:47,150 --> 01:39:49,120
was very validating.

2254
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:51,660
Don't cry.

2255
01:39:53,530 --> 01:39:56,259
(Hugging)

2256
01:39:56,260 --> 01:39:58,760
Did Lia Kim give them 100 points?

2257
01:39:58,860 --> 01:40:00,170
- All of them? - All of them.

2258
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:02,840
- That's right. - All of them?

2259
01:40:03,140 --> 01:40:04,339
Did they all give 100?

2260
01:40:04,340 --> 01:40:07,409
Lia Kim is so particular and strict.

2261
01:40:07,410 --> 01:40:08,770
- All of them gave 100. - She gave 100.

2262
01:40:08,870 --> 01:40:11,640
She was a tough judge. I was noticing.

2263
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:15,680
So the fact that she gave us that perfect score...

2264
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:18,849
Again, it was a very validating feeling.

2265
01:40:18,850 --> 01:40:20,589
So I'm just really grateful...

2266
01:40:20,590 --> 01:40:23,360
that she saw us truly.

2267
01:40:23,890 --> 01:40:27,330
They put a lot of focus on the meaning.

2268
01:40:27,660 --> 01:40:30,029
Artistically...

2269
01:40:30,030 --> 01:40:32,259
and visually, it was very nice.

2270
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:36,099
It's just a different feeling.

2271
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:37,269
There's a reason behind the black and white color scheme.

2272
01:40:37,270 --> 01:40:39,099
It wasn't done just to look cool.

2273
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:41,269
There are no colors in the hip-hop culture.

2274
01:40:41,270 --> 01:40:42,270
You know, it's like...

2275
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:45,309
There are no colors. This is the American identity.

2276
01:40:45,310 --> 01:40:47,250
It began here, right?

2277
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:49,850
Also, when Miyu entered,

2278
01:40:49,950 --> 01:40:52,049
she was wearing a white outfit.

2279
01:40:52,050 --> 01:40:54,049
- It was... - In a white outfit, she was happy.

2280
01:40:54,050 --> 01:40:55,389
But in a red outfit...

2281
01:40:55,390 --> 01:40:56,889
- "This is America." - She just...

2282
01:40:56,890 --> 01:40:58,659
- didn't move. That's right. - Yes.

2283
01:40:58,660 --> 01:41:01,589
She got a certain color because of the adults.

2284
01:41:01,590 --> 01:41:04,060
Thus, she can't do anything.

2285
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:06,369
There was a feeling of things closing up on her.

2286
01:41:06,370 --> 01:41:07,930
I think there were such expressions.

2287
01:41:08,570 --> 01:41:11,370
The choreography looks simple,

2288
01:41:11,470 --> 01:41:16,580
but there's a deep reason behind every movement.

2289
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:18,539
- While it's simple, - That's right.

2290
01:41:18,540 --> 01:41:21,809
You feel like, "Why is it so powerful?"

2291
01:41:21,810 --> 01:41:24,180
- Everything has a reason. - That's right.

2292
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:28,220
The video showed us why the American culture leads...

2293
01:41:29,050 --> 01:41:30,220
the world's entertainment business.

2294
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:31,890
I don't even want to give them a score.

2295
01:41:32,090 --> 01:41:33,590
- Something like this... - I agree.

2296
01:41:33,690 --> 01:41:36,429
Goes beyond the skills, right?

2297
01:41:36,430 --> 01:41:39,569
It's... Real art is...

2298
01:41:39,570 --> 01:41:41,929
When people watch this in 50 years,

2299
01:41:41,930 --> 01:41:47,140
they'll know that the US had this vibe in 2025.

2300
01:41:48,370 --> 01:41:51,280
I also just want to commend Nyssa...

2301
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:55,380
because she had a passing in the family...

2302
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:59,589
pretty much the moment we had to shoot.

2303
01:41:59,590 --> 01:42:02,249
And she remained here for us...

2304
01:42:02,250 --> 01:42:03,790
and stayed the whole way through.

2305
01:42:04,390 --> 01:42:06,089
Thank you so much, Nyssa.

2306
01:42:06,090 --> 01:42:07,930
And thank you to everyone.

2307
01:42:09,190 --> 01:42:10,259
Thank you.

2308
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:12,400
(Nyssa did her job without complaint despite the hardship.)

2309
01:42:12,700 --> 01:42:14,530
- That's incredible. - She struggled a lot.

2310
01:42:15,430 --> 01:42:16,840
Good work, guys.

2311
01:42:17,370 --> 01:42:20,070
You guys can all just come and sit.

2312
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:21,740
Oh, my gosh.

2313
01:42:22,170 --> 01:42:23,509
- I'm so proud of you guys. - Good job, guys.

2314
01:42:23,510 --> 01:42:24,840
Good job, y'all.

2315
01:42:25,510 --> 01:42:28,010
I'm so proud of all of you guys.

2316
01:42:28,650 --> 01:42:29,880
We deserve it though.

2317
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:33,389
Great job, MOTIV.

2318
01:42:33,390 --> 01:42:34,950
(The dancers give MOTV a warm round of applause.)

2319
01:42:35,590 --> 01:42:37,589
- MOTIV went through a lot. - There were many hardships.

2320
01:42:37,590 --> 01:42:38,720
- That's right. - I bet.

2321
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:41,560
Currently, the crew that ranked first in the fight judges' score...

2322
01:42:41,660 --> 01:42:45,560
is MOTIV with 1,160 points.

2323
01:42:46,370 --> 01:42:47,770
That's crazy.

2324
01:42:48,830 --> 01:42:50,500
And I feel a lot more confident.

2325
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:52,669
It's close to being the perfect score.

2326
01:42:52,670 --> 01:42:54,009
- It's nearly a perfect score. - It's nearly a perfect score.

2327
01:42:54,010 --> 01:42:56,170
That's right. It's only short of 40 points.

2328
01:42:56,710 --> 01:42:58,080
I can't predict the result.

2329
01:42:58,980 --> 01:43:00,810
Then the Korean crew will fall right underneath.

2330
01:43:01,210 --> 01:43:02,920
There won't be any more scores, right?

2331
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:05,720
(Will BUMSUP be able to surpass MOTIV's fight judges' score?)

2332
01:43:06,050 --> 01:43:09,690
Next, I'll reveal the fight judges' score...

2333
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:12,990
for Team Korea, BUMSUP.

2334
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:16,229
I think they're going to get 100...

2335
01:43:16,230 --> 01:43:18,060
- for the high-angle section. - I agree.

2336
01:43:18,330 --> 01:43:21,270
BUMSUP. I didn't expect them to do what they did.

2337
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:24,100
I think BUMSUP is our rival.

2338
01:43:25,170 --> 01:43:27,710
I kept seeing the moves I've seen before.

2339
01:43:27,810 --> 01:43:31,580
I'll grit my teeth and show everyone what we can do.

2340
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:34,710
(How will BUMSUP's Mega Crew Performance be?)

2341
01:43:34,980 --> 01:43:36,320
(The day the Mega Crew Mission got revealed)

2342
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:39,250
(The long-awaited Mega Crew Mission got revealed.)

2343
01:43:39,650 --> 01:43:42,519
There's a lot of pressure on me this time.

2344
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:44,789
We won by a small margin in the previous mission.

2345
01:43:44,790 --> 01:43:47,629
But since the crew hasn't been doing well,

2346
01:43:47,630 --> 01:43:50,359
I want us to redeem ourselves.

2347
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:52,300
I need to prove myself.

2348
01:43:54,130 --> 01:43:55,370
Hello, I'm Honey J.

2349
01:43:55,470 --> 01:43:56,999
- Love's mom. - Love's mom.

2350
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,039
She's right here.

2351
01:43:58,040 --> 01:43:59,439
(Honey J challenged herself to be on Street Woman Fighter again...)

2352
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:00,440
(after giving birth.)

2353
01:44:00,441 --> 01:44:02,340
I recently gave birth.

2354
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:05,180
And I'll be turning 40 soon.

2355
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:06,680
It's fascinating, right?

2356
01:44:07,380 --> 01:44:09,379
When I started dancing again after giving birth,

2357
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:12,720
I told myself that I just needed to recover slowly.

2358
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:15,190
But I got to join this show on very short notice,

2359
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:17,489
and I didn't have much time.

2360
01:44:17,490 --> 01:44:19,220
I needed to recover fast.

2361
01:44:20,260 --> 01:44:22,159
I'm a bit worried about that.

2362
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:24,460
In any case, my condition...

2363
01:44:26,330 --> 01:44:27,930
needs to get better.

2364
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:33,510
But I've always lived my life while overcoming that pressure.

2365
01:44:33,610 --> 01:44:36,480
So I'll grit my teeth for this.

2366
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:40,010
When I come home after practice,

2367
01:44:40,110 --> 01:44:41,510
I need to go to sleep right away.

2368
01:44:41,610 --> 01:44:45,350
But my mind is on this.

2369
01:44:45,850 --> 01:44:48,250
I'm going through the storyboard.

2370
01:44:48,450 --> 01:44:49,450
Act One.

2371
01:44:51,260 --> 01:44:53,730
I got ridiculed for my drawing.

2372
01:44:55,260 --> 01:44:56,360
Act Two.

2373
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,999
Can you recognize anything? You'll be surprised.

2374
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,270
When you see the final product,

2375
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,369
you'll see that it's the same.

2376
01:45:03,370 --> 01:45:05,839
I thought about what would represent Korea...

2377
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:08,239
in a simple and clear way.

2378
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:10,779
I thought of the oriental aspect.

2379
01:45:10,780 --> 01:45:13,279
The thing is, 1MILLION's work became the talk of the town.

2380
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:15,180
It was so nicely done.

2381
01:45:15,510 --> 01:45:19,249
I thought very hard about how we could capture...

2382
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:21,790
the Korean charm without it being boring.

2383
01:45:21,990 --> 01:45:25,589
I thought about the theme of a nightmare.

2384
01:45:25,590 --> 01:45:28,429
I thought about the concept of the Grim Reaper.

2385
01:45:28,430 --> 01:45:30,459
It was portrayed as the Grim Reaper,

2386
01:45:30,460 --> 01:45:33,200
but everyone has anxiety in their lives.

2387
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:38,199
The subconscious anxiety in the fast-paced society...

2388
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:39,840
of Korea...

2389
01:45:39,940 --> 01:45:41,810
was conveyed as a nightmare.

2390
01:45:42,170 --> 01:45:44,779
The point of the mission...

2391
01:45:44,780 --> 01:45:47,279
is to include the Korean elements.

2392
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:51,020
A traditional item we can bring that stands out...

2393
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:52,520
is gat, the traditional hat.

2394
01:45:52,850 --> 01:45:56,859
We tried very hard to include the Korean identity...

2395
01:45:56,860 --> 01:46:00,259
in the costumes and music.

2396
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:02,229
We want it to be like the OST of a movie...

2397
01:46:02,230 --> 01:46:04,699
- rather than a regular song. - Okay.

2398
01:46:04,700 --> 01:46:06,769
It should go like this.

2399
01:46:06,770 --> 01:46:09,329
It'll be nice to include the sound of ajaeng.

2400
01:46:09,330 --> 01:46:11,440
Firstly, the song should be good.

2401
01:46:11,540 --> 01:46:12,600
Okay.

2402
01:46:12,970 --> 01:46:15,810
The gat should be included in the choreography...

2403
01:46:15,910 --> 01:46:19,179
if we want it to play its role in the costume.

2404
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:21,749
I thought it'd be nice to use it...

2405
01:46:21,750 --> 01:46:24,520
- for the top view. - Five, six, seven, eight.

2406
01:46:24,620 --> 01:46:26,149
One, two.

2407
01:46:26,150 --> 01:46:29,719
We went, "How can we use it well?"

2408
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:31,219
What are you doing?

2409
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:32,590
I'm making sujebi.

2410
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:35,089
We put white masking tape on one side...

2411
01:46:35,090 --> 01:46:37,560
to create a big effect when we flipped the hat over.

2412
01:46:37,660 --> 01:46:39,300
We taped each hat.

2413
01:46:39,700 --> 01:46:41,170
It's beautiful.

2414
01:46:41,770 --> 01:46:45,869
We recruited the members of PROWDMON, HolyBang,

2415
01:46:45,870 --> 01:46:49,040
HOOK, and CocaNButter from Season One.

2416
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:53,879
Everyone who was inside and outside of Street Woman Fighter helped.

2417
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:56,180
A very special Grim Reaper...

2418
01:46:56,680 --> 01:46:58,849
- agreed to help. - What?

2419
01:46:58,850 --> 01:46:59,850
Let's go.

2420
01:46:59,851 --> 01:47:03,519
She's the leader of BEBE, the winning crew of Season Two.

2421
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:07,729
Bada's face has a cold charm.

2422
01:47:07,730 --> 01:47:11,030
I thought that she suited the image of the Grim Reaper.

2423
01:47:11,130 --> 01:47:12,930
The boss of the Grim Reapers.

2424
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:19,099
To include the Grim Reaper in the theme of a nightmare,

2425
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:22,070
there must be someone who dreams it.

2426
01:47:22,410 --> 01:47:23,439
So...

2427
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:27,710
She'll lead the storyline of our performance.

2428
01:47:27,810 --> 01:47:30,420
She's actress Roh Yoon Seo.

2429
01:47:30,850 --> 01:47:34,750
- Let's go! - Everyone, she's my friend!

2430
01:47:35,190 --> 01:47:37,059
I'm actress Roh Yoon Seo.

2431
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:39,860
I have the role of a storyteller...

2432
01:47:40,030 --> 01:47:42,160
who represents Team Korea.

2433
01:47:43,090 --> 01:47:47,630
We thought it'd be nice to give the role to someone...

2434
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:51,570
who had better expressions than a dancer.

2435
01:47:52,570 --> 01:47:54,439
It enriched our performance.

2436
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:56,139
We were so grateful...

2437
01:47:56,140 --> 01:47:58,910
that we prepared a gift.

2438
01:47:59,110 --> 01:48:01,049
(A gift!)

2439
01:48:01,050 --> 01:48:02,580
Please bring out the gifts.

2440
01:48:02,910 --> 01:48:04,449
(The gifts enter.)

2441
01:48:04,450 --> 01:48:06,050
(Take one each.)

2442
01:48:06,550 --> 01:48:08,589
(BUMSUP distributes the gifts for the diligent dancers.)

2443
01:48:08,590 --> 01:48:10,090
We'll take this before the shoot.

2444
01:48:10,690 --> 01:48:12,159
Make sure you take it.

2445
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:13,559
It's probiotics for weight loss.

2446
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:15,089
It's good for your digestive system...

2447
01:48:15,090 --> 01:48:16,599
and managing your body fat.

2448
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:18,999
People on a diet worry a lot about carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.

2449
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,769
- That's right. - They worry about them a lot.

2450
01:48:20,770 --> 01:48:23,499
I take one at a time in order to lose weight.

2451
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:25,139
It's a good tip for staying fit.

2452
01:48:25,140 --> 01:48:26,169
I want it.

2453
01:48:26,170 --> 01:48:28,309
It's convenient to carry around.

2454
01:48:28,310 --> 01:48:30,379
That's right. You can put it in your pocket.

2455
01:48:30,380 --> 01:48:32,309
We can take one before practice.

2456
01:48:32,310 --> 01:48:33,509
- Seriously. - It's nice.

2457
01:48:33,510 --> 01:48:34,579
(BUMSUP's mega crew, let's fight on today!)

2458
01:48:34,580 --> 01:48:35,610
Let's go!

2459
01:48:38,150 --> 01:48:39,250
What? It's tasty.

2460
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:41,189
- It's really tasty. - It's refreshing.

2461
01:48:41,190 --> 01:48:45,319
We were so thankful that they came to help at once.

2462
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:47,490
We'll pay them back through a good performance.

2463
01:48:47,860 --> 01:48:49,760
(Practice for Mega Crew Mission)

2464
01:48:50,260 --> 01:48:53,730
You'll now get the team costume and pants.

2465
01:48:53,830 --> 01:48:55,629
At first, we wondered...

2466
01:48:55,630 --> 01:48:58,669
if the Grim Reapers should wear black.

2467
01:48:58,670 --> 01:49:02,509
But black clothes on the stage are a double-edged sword.

2468
01:49:02,510 --> 01:49:05,879
We'll wear a white, cropped blazer...

2469
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:08,249
with a sheer shirt inside to give it the vibe...

2470
01:49:08,250 --> 01:49:09,450
of sobok, mourning clothes.

2471
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:11,419
We thought it'd be nice...

2472
01:49:11,420 --> 01:49:14,250
to use black and white to give it a modern look.

2473
01:49:16,690 --> 01:49:18,990
(Thus, 100 modern Grim Repaers were born.)

2474
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:21,189
Let's film the top view.

2475
01:49:21,190 --> 01:49:23,189
Let's do it in three attempts.

2476
01:49:23,190 --> 01:49:24,799
- Okay. - Okay.

2477
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:27,030
Five, six, seven, eight.

2478
01:49:27,170 --> 01:49:30,000
(The 100 dancers move to Director Honey J's shout.)

2479
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:33,200
(Focused)

2480
01:49:33,410 --> 01:49:35,309
Again! You guys aren't in sync.

2481
01:49:35,310 --> 01:49:39,209
From the top view, even a minuscule mistake...

2482
01:49:39,210 --> 01:49:41,910
stands out.

2483
01:49:43,350 --> 01:49:46,550
The top view was definitely hard.

2484
01:49:47,190 --> 01:49:49,490
All right. Let's begin.

2485
01:49:49,790 --> 01:49:51,790
(Nervous)

2486
01:49:52,020 --> 01:49:53,260
One and two.

2487
01:49:54,390 --> 01:49:56,429
You guys are not in sync from 1 and 2.

2488
01:49:56,430 --> 01:49:57,559
None of it is in sync.

2489
01:49:57,560 --> 01:50:00,129
It's as if you guys have never practiced together.

2490
01:50:00,130 --> 01:50:02,299
Feel the rhythm of the dancers next to you...

2491
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:06,639
and check the space between you and them.

2492
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:08,839
Don't just go on your way.

2493
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:11,709
One and two. Three and four. Five...

2494
01:50:11,710 --> 01:50:13,710
This won't do. This really won't do. It's not happening.

2495
01:50:13,980 --> 01:50:15,979
(Sighing)

2496
01:50:15,980 --> 01:50:18,379
For a second, I felt so dejected.

2497
01:50:18,380 --> 01:50:19,649
I gave up on sleep...

2498
01:50:19,650 --> 01:50:21,789
and did my absolute best.

2499
01:50:21,790 --> 01:50:23,190
But it still didn't work.

2500
01:50:24,190 --> 01:50:26,559
We really couldn't take a shortcut...

2501
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:29,859
because the angle revealed everything.

2502
01:50:29,860 --> 01:50:31,029
The fear of the top-down shot.

2503
01:50:31,030 --> 01:50:32,930
It was like we were in a horror movie titled "Gat."

2504
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:36,939
Everyone is moving differently.

2505
01:50:36,940 --> 01:50:39,439
The thing is, every dancer has different arm lengths.

2506
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:42,369
Realistically speaking, it's impossible to time...

2507
01:50:42,370 --> 01:50:43,879
this movement.

2508
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:46,240
Let's just put it down close to the body.

2509
01:50:46,510 --> 01:50:48,909
Please say, "Stop and stop."

2510
01:50:48,910 --> 01:50:50,319
- At first, I was like, - Set, go.

2511
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:52,249
- "What should I do?" - Stop and stop.

2512
01:50:52,250 --> 01:50:53,749
- I'll try... - Stop and stop.

2513
01:50:53,750 --> 01:50:55,189
- different methods... - Again.

2514
01:50:55,190 --> 01:50:58,220
- and find a way. - Stop and stop.

2515
01:51:00,230 --> 01:51:02,259
What you did just now was good.

2516
01:51:02,260 --> 01:51:03,659
- Okay. - Please.

2517
01:51:03,660 --> 01:51:05,199
Please.

2518
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:08,199
I was so thankful that they followed my directions...

2519
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:09,400
very well.

2520
01:51:09,630 --> 01:51:12,069
- Everyone! - Yes!

2521
01:51:12,070 --> 01:51:16,979
Thank you so much for joining us for the Mega Crew Mission.

2522
01:51:16,980 --> 01:51:19,639
We still have many practices left.

2523
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:21,680
Please enjoy the meal today.

2524
01:51:21,910 --> 01:51:23,149
We're in your care.

2525
01:51:23,150 --> 01:51:25,079
- We're in your care. - We're in your care.

2526
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:27,189
- Eat up. - Eat up.

2527
01:51:27,190 --> 01:51:28,250
- Okay! - Okay!

2528
01:51:28,620 --> 01:51:31,160
This is insane. How is the meat so high-quality?

2529
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:32,590
It looks tasty.

2530
01:51:32,820 --> 01:51:34,359
You know this, right?

2531
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:36,329
- Where is the owner? - You know that you need to eat...

2532
01:51:36,330 --> 01:51:38,199
pork with water parsley, right?

2533
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:39,960
- Yes. It's the best. - You know that, right?

2534
01:51:40,070 --> 01:51:41,270
This is a global trend too.

2535
01:51:41,970 --> 01:51:43,940
We weren't the only ones who went abroad.

2536
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:46,500
- Please eat up today. - Okay.

2537
01:51:47,810 --> 01:51:49,139
- Cheers. - Cheers.

2538
01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:50,810
(They put the meat in their mouths.)

2539
01:51:52,040 --> 01:51:53,210
- It's so tasty. - It's tasty.

2540
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:59,879
It's so tasty. The pork belly is leader-class.

2541
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:02,190
It's the thickest.

2542
01:52:03,250 --> 01:52:05,189
(A surprise cake enters out of the blue.)

2543
01:52:05,190 --> 01:52:06,260
Everyone.

2544
01:52:06,860 --> 01:52:08,829
Five, six, seven, eight.

2545
01:52:08,830 --> 01:52:11,899
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

2546
01:52:11,900 --> 01:52:14,829
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

2547
01:52:14,830 --> 01:52:18,399
- Happy birthday, dear Ri.hey - Happy birthday, dear Ri.hey

2548
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:21,370
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

2549
01:52:22,410 --> 01:52:24,740
Thank you.

2550
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:27,350
Oh, my. What happened to this one?

2551
01:52:29,410 --> 01:52:30,879
(They filled their stomachs and hearts...)

2552
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:32,380
(during the heartwarming team dinner.)

2553
01:52:34,820 --> 01:52:37,389
How will other crews predict our performance?

2554
01:52:37,390 --> 01:52:40,429
I told myself that it shouldn't be similar...

2555
01:52:40,430 --> 01:52:42,089
to HolyBang's.

2556
01:52:42,090 --> 01:52:44,499
With your directing skills,

2557
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:47,829
you started this mission anew.

2558
01:52:47,830 --> 01:52:48,830
I'm glad to hear that.

2559
01:52:48,831 --> 01:52:50,399
There are many aspects I haven't seen before.

2560
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:52,869
I like that you have conviction.

2561
01:52:52,870 --> 01:52:55,810
When the leader wavers,

2562
01:52:56,010 --> 01:52:59,180
the members are bound to be anxious.

2563
01:52:59,340 --> 01:53:02,909
- When you lead with conviction... - That's right.

2564
01:53:02,910 --> 01:53:05,920
We're able to push forward, trusting you.

2565
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:09,749
- That's right. - I can feel your trust,

2566
01:53:09,750 --> 01:53:11,460
so I'm really thankful.

2567
01:53:11,690 --> 01:53:13,790
- It's the best. - Let's eat meat, cheer up,

2568
01:53:14,030 --> 01:53:16,489
and fight on today.

2569
01:53:16,490 --> 01:53:17,660
Let's bring the meat together.

2570
01:53:17,930 --> 01:53:21,570
- Pig energy, oink, oink! Cheers! - Pig energy, oink, oink! Cheers!

2571
01:53:22,170 --> 01:53:23,430
Let's take first place.

2572
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:25,700
It's here.

2573
01:53:27,070 --> 01:53:28,670
I don't know what to do.

2574
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:30,509
(Other crews watch BUMSUP's rehearsal video.)

2575
01:53:30,510 --> 01:53:31,939
It's totally Korea.

2576
01:53:31,940 --> 01:53:33,479
It's nice.

2577
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:34,780
The hats are sick.

2578
01:53:35,050 --> 01:53:36,850
The music is making me anxious.

2579
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:38,750
It's like a horror movie.

2580
01:53:38,920 --> 01:53:40,690
I love this concept.

2581
01:53:40,890 --> 01:53:42,419
Oh, snap.

2582
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:44,259
Oh, wait.

2583
01:53:44,260 --> 01:53:45,319
This is dope.

2584
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:47,829
It must've been hard to pull off.

2585
01:53:47,830 --> 01:53:49,929
In terms of the high-angle section, it's number one so far.

2586
01:53:49,930 --> 01:53:50,930
(They have my respect.)

2587
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:52,599
BUMSUP.

2588
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:53,600
(BUMSUP's ranking after the final rehearsal's evaluation video)

2589
01:53:53,870 --> 01:53:56,270
BUMSUP's average ranking is...

2590
01:53:57,240 --> 01:53:58,340
second.

2591
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:01,809
- Oh, my gosh. - Oh, my gosh.

2592
01:54:01,810 --> 01:54:03,910
- Oh, my gosh. - Are you serious?

2593
01:54:04,210 --> 01:54:07,349
The high-angle section was intense. The crew that captured...

2594
01:54:07,350 --> 01:54:09,949
a definite point was the Korean crew.

2595
01:54:09,950 --> 01:54:12,779
I think visually, it's really impressive.

2596
01:54:12,780 --> 01:54:14,849
- I'm so excited to see... - The music.

2597
01:54:14,850 --> 01:54:18,589
What this will look like when it's actually shot and filmed.

2598
01:54:18,590 --> 01:54:19,990
Well, I'm upset.

2599
01:54:21,130 --> 01:54:22,490
I'm upset.

2600
01:54:22,830 --> 01:54:27,070
I loved the hats so much and the utilization of them.

2601
01:54:27,270 --> 01:54:28,830
That was really good.

2602
01:54:29,330 --> 01:54:30,799
Who choreographed it?

2603
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:31,869
Who put it together?

2604
01:54:31,870 --> 01:54:34,669
That's impressive. Honey J has leadership.

2605
01:54:34,670 --> 01:54:37,279
Among the interim checks we've had so far,

2606
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:38,579
- this is the most hopeful. - Yes.

2607
01:54:38,580 --> 01:54:40,209
I'm certain...

2608
01:54:40,210 --> 01:54:43,249
that our top-down shot will be number one.

2609
01:54:43,250 --> 01:54:47,950
Honey J suggested using gat for the high-angle section.

2610
01:54:48,190 --> 01:54:50,259
- I think it was a good choice. - Me too.

2611
01:54:50,260 --> 01:54:52,359
At first, I was very worried...

2612
01:54:52,360 --> 01:54:55,389
because I knew that it wouldn't be easy to make 100 people...

2613
01:54:55,390 --> 01:54:56,889
- move in sync. - Seriously.

2614
01:54:56,890 --> 01:54:59,099
Honey J led us,

2615
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:01,099
and I had no doubt that she would show us her conviction.

2616
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:03,099
One, two. Should we begin going up at four?

2617
01:55:03,100 --> 01:55:04,699
As soon as World of Street Woman Fighter began,

2618
01:55:04,700 --> 01:55:06,839
Honey J thought hard about what to do...

2619
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:08,069
- for the Mega Crew Mission. - That's right.

2620
01:55:08,070 --> 01:55:09,070
That's right.

2621
01:55:09,071 --> 01:55:11,479
I loved HolyBang's performance for the Mega Crew Mission...

2622
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:14,010
of Street Woman Fighter.

2623
01:55:14,410 --> 01:55:17,779
I hope people will look forward to...

2624
01:55:17,780 --> 01:55:21,950
how my performance will look after four years.

2625
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:24,620
BUMSUP's Mega Crew Mission...

2626
01:55:24,890 --> 01:55:27,429
is very diverse and rich.

2627
01:55:27,430 --> 01:55:29,829
We put our hearts into this,

2628
01:55:29,830 --> 01:55:31,059
so it's bound to look good.

2629
01:55:31,060 --> 01:55:33,199
I'm certain that it'll look good.

2630
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:36,229
Now, I'll reveal the fight judges' score...

2631
01:55:36,230 --> 01:55:39,370
for the high-angle challenge first.

2632
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:42,010
Maybe all of them gave 100.

2633
01:55:42,870 --> 01:55:44,780
Do you think they're going to get the perfect score?

2634
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:46,340
(Who knows?)

2635
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:49,209
Both the dancers and the BUMSUP members...

2636
01:55:49,210 --> 01:55:50,580
worked really hard.

2637
01:55:55,720 --> 01:55:57,420
(Perfect score)

2638
01:55:58,260 --> 01:56:00,060
(We did it!)

2639
01:56:01,260 --> 01:56:02,789
(Hugging)

2640
01:56:02,790 --> 01:56:03,799
It was well-deserved.

2641
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:05,660
(They deserve it.)

2642
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:07,230
I'm not surprised.

2643
01:56:07,270 --> 01:56:08,270
Yes.

2644
01:56:08,370 --> 01:56:11,540
One million people will think that it's impressive.

2645
01:56:12,370 --> 01:56:13,470
That high-angle section.

2646
01:56:13,770 --> 01:56:17,010
Thankfully, we got the perfect score of 300 points.

2647
01:56:17,380 --> 01:56:19,440
It was thanks to the dancers...

2648
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:22,250
who worked hard.

2649
01:56:22,580 --> 01:56:24,219
Now,

2650
01:56:24,220 --> 01:56:27,090
let's check out the Mega Crew Performance Video...

2651
01:56:27,850 --> 01:56:28,920
by BUMSUP.

2652
01:56:29,890 --> 01:56:31,420
Let's go.

2653
01:56:32,060 --> 01:56:33,490
(We're looking forward to it!)

2654
01:56:33,620 --> 01:56:34,889
They have the most advantage for this mission.

2655
01:56:34,890 --> 01:56:36,389
They have experience in working with the mega crew.

2656
01:56:36,390 --> 01:56:40,699
They can include all the details into the performance.

2657
01:56:40,700 --> 01:56:41,830
I'm looking forward to it.

2658
01:56:42,170 --> 01:56:43,430
I'm very curious.

2659
01:56:44,900 --> 01:56:46,639
("At the Edge of a Dream," Directed by Honey J)

2660
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:48,369
(Through a girl's journey in a dream, )

2661
01:56:48,370 --> 01:56:50,109
(the Korean vibe and group subconscious...)

2662
01:56:50,110 --> 01:56:51,880
(have been explored through a performance.)

2663
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:01,120
I'm getting chills.

2664
01:57:03,490 --> 01:57:05,189
- Yoon Seo! - Yoon Seo. My goodness.

2665
01:57:05,190 --> 01:57:06,390
Yoon Seo!

2666
01:57:06,890 --> 01:57:07,890
Yoon Seo!

2667
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:12,660
Hey.

2668
01:57:13,830 --> 01:57:15,470
This is my favorite part.

2669
01:57:17,370 --> 01:57:18,440
Honey J!

2670
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:20,200
Honey J is insane.

2671
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:24,040
I love that.

2672
01:57:24,710 --> 01:57:26,779
(Insane control)

2673
01:57:26,780 --> 01:57:28,249
It's game over.

2674
01:57:28,250 --> 01:57:29,409
It's game over.

2675
01:57:29,410 --> 01:57:30,480
Crazy.

2676
01:57:32,450 --> 01:57:33,450
It's game over.

2677
01:57:35,150 --> 01:57:37,260
Period. Yes, this is fire.

2678
01:57:41,860 --> 01:57:43,800
The sudden change in the flow is so...

2679
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:45,660
They're insane.

2680
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:48,569
- I like this part. - Yes. Me too.

2681
01:57:48,570 --> 01:57:50,100
- It brings back memories. - Yes.

2682
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:52,540
- I can still remember the count. - Me too.

2683
01:57:56,410 --> 01:57:57,710
My goodness.

2684
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:03,049
These movements are so Korean.

2685
01:58:03,050 --> 01:58:04,050
Gossaum.

2686
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:06,550
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2687
01:58:07,250 --> 01:58:08,689
It's definitely fire.

2688
01:58:08,690 --> 01:58:10,690
Hey.

2689
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:14,030
- Hey! - Hey!

2690
01:58:15,530 --> 01:58:16,590
Hyojin Choi, let's go.

2691
01:58:19,900 --> 01:58:20,900
What?

2692
01:58:20,930 --> 01:58:21,930
Oh, my.

2693
01:58:23,300 --> 01:58:24,470
This is insane.

2694
01:58:25,900 --> 01:58:27,099
Let's go.

2695
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:28,839
We had confidence in the high-angle section.

2696
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:29,840
Let's go.

2697
01:58:36,110 --> 01:58:37,719
(Shocked)

2698
01:58:37,720 --> 01:58:38,720
What?

2699
01:58:40,020 --> 01:58:41,050
What is this?

2700
01:58:42,890 --> 01:58:44,420
Black and white. Goodness.

2701
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:52,430
(They pulled that off?)

2702
01:58:54,630 --> 01:58:56,830
Crazy.

2703
01:58:57,970 --> 01:59:01,170
Oh, my gosh.

2704
01:59:03,670 --> 01:59:05,840
That's epic. It's giving me chills.

2705
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:08,450
(Wow)

2706
01:59:12,850 --> 01:59:15,690
- Let's go! - Oh, my gosh.

2707
01:59:16,150 --> 01:59:17,559
They are it.

2708
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:19,190
They went all out.

2709
01:59:19,590 --> 01:59:21,630
How on earth did they come up with that?

2710
01:59:21,830 --> 01:59:23,659
This is a total masterpiece!

2711
01:59:23,660 --> 01:59:24,900
That's crazy.

2712
01:59:26,860 --> 01:59:28,670
- Bada? - Let's go!

2713
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:30,740
Yes, Bada!

2714
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:33,539
- Let's go, Bada! - Let's go, Bada!

2715
01:59:33,540 --> 01:59:36,010
- Let's go! - Bada!

2716
01:59:37,910 --> 01:59:39,880
Look at the number of people at the back.

2717
01:59:42,250 --> 01:59:44,680
Every single dance move has its own unique flow.

2718
01:59:48,790 --> 01:59:49,820
We love Lip J.

2719
01:59:51,990 --> 01:59:53,160
Let's go, Lip J.

2720
01:59:55,430 --> 01:59:56,790
Let's go!

2721
01:59:57,030 --> 01:59:58,829
- Bada! - Let's go!

2722
01:59:58,830 --> 01:59:59,860
Just look at her facial expression.

2723
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:06,240
(Getting sucked right in)

2724
02:00:07,270 --> 02:00:10,010
The blues and the reds are really pretty too.

2725
02:00:14,680 --> 02:00:15,750
Leejung.

2726
02:00:16,110 --> 02:00:18,120
See how spot-on that angle is.

2727
02:00:18,250 --> 02:00:19,720
I love this part.

2728
02:00:19,780 --> 02:00:21,150
(They all love it.)

2729
02:00:21,390 --> 02:00:22,450
It's good.

2730
02:00:22,690 --> 02:00:24,260
I love their attitude.

2731
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:26,820
Look, they matched the expressions perfectly.

2732
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:31,800
So fly!

2733
02:00:33,860 --> 02:00:35,830
This choreography is oozing real Korean vibes.

2734
02:00:58,590 --> 02:00:59,660
I love it.

2735
02:01:00,120 --> 02:01:01,259
That's a picture.

2736
02:01:01,260 --> 02:01:02,260
(Thunderous applause)

2737
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:04,900
(It gave me goosebumps.)

2738
02:01:06,830 --> 02:01:08,270
I got chills.

2739
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:10,640
(The judges have lost words.)

2740
02:01:10,840 --> 02:01:12,800
(Speechless)

2741
02:01:13,100 --> 02:01:14,839
(Laughing)

2742
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:16,170
They did incredibly well.

2743
02:01:16,940 --> 02:01:17,979
They gave everything they had.

2744
02:01:17,980 --> 02:01:18,980
- This is just... - Seriously.

2745
02:01:19,240 --> 02:01:20,539
This is honestly incredible.

2746
02:01:20,540 --> 02:01:23,009
Yes, it's basically like a movie.

2747
02:01:23,010 --> 02:01:24,479
- That ending picture, though... - So good.

2748
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:27,119
- It was just like a poster. - So cool.

2749
02:01:27,120 --> 02:01:28,520
So cool.

2750
02:01:28,590 --> 02:01:30,020
It gave me chills.

2751
02:01:31,220 --> 02:01:33,890
From the previously revealed fight judges' scores,

2752
02:01:34,060 --> 02:01:36,559
the high-angle challenge...

2753
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:37,800
received 300 points.

2754
02:01:38,260 --> 02:01:39,899
Our hard work has paid off.

2755
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:41,169
We gave everything we had.

2756
02:01:41,170 --> 02:01:43,399
The most unique thing about BUMSUP’s high-angle section...

2757
02:01:43,400 --> 02:01:44,769
is how it goes from perfect order...

2758
02:01:44,770 --> 02:01:46,569
to complete chaos.

2759
02:01:46,570 --> 02:01:49,439
Each of those 100 dancers has completely different choreography.

2760
02:01:49,440 --> 02:01:51,079
Every single move is unique.

2761
02:01:51,080 --> 02:01:53,579
And someone had to create all of that.

2762
02:01:53,580 --> 02:01:56,679
This is absolutely insane. It’s impossible.

2763
02:01:56,680 --> 02:01:59,779
And on top of that, they nailed the artistry as well.

2764
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:01,749
They didn’t sacrifice the artistic side at all.

2765
02:02:01,750 --> 02:02:03,020
They deserve a perfect score.

2766
02:02:03,250 --> 02:02:06,989
Now, what will the fight judges' scores be...

2767
02:02:06,990 --> 02:02:10,490
for National Identity, Directing Skills, and Choreography?

2768
02:02:10,900 --> 02:02:12,899
- Maybe 1,100? - I bet.

2769
02:02:12,900 --> 02:02:14,830
Imagine they get a perfect score.

2770
02:02:15,200 --> 02:02:18,570
I wouldn't score their choreography perfect.

2771
02:02:18,670 --> 02:02:20,709
National identity was super clear.

2772
02:02:20,710 --> 02:02:23,539
I'm confident with my directing too.

2773
02:02:23,540 --> 02:02:25,080
Mega Crew Mission.

2774
02:02:25,140 --> 02:02:28,309
We will now reveal the final fight judge score...

2775
02:02:28,310 --> 02:02:29,410
of BUMSUP.

2776
02:02:30,310 --> 02:02:32,220
(What will BUMSUP’s final fight judges' score be?)

2777
02:02:35,490 --> 02:02:36,689
(Surprised)

2778
02:02:36,690 --> 02:02:38,720
(Shocked)

2779
02:02:45,730 --> 02:02:46,899
(No way!)

2780
02:02:46,900 --> 02:02:48,400
Honey J!

2781
02:02:49,900 --> 02:02:52,840
- Really? - Honey J!

2782
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:56,440
- Wait, I got goosebumps! - Incredible.

2783
02:02:56,740 --> 02:02:58,440
That did look like hard work. Seriously.

2784
02:02:58,810 --> 02:03:00,439
That's unreal.

2785
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:01,750
Absolutely dominating.

2786
02:03:01,850 --> 02:03:05,020
- Well done. - Good job, you guys.

2787
02:03:05,450 --> 02:03:08,020
As far as this mission goes...

2788
02:03:08,790 --> 02:03:10,249
I'm sorry to break it to you, but they're on a whole other level.

2789
02:03:10,250 --> 02:03:12,789
What BUMSUP did is on a completely different level...

2790
02:03:12,790 --> 02:03:14,020
from the other teams.

2791
02:03:14,530 --> 02:03:16,590
They only used the colors of the Korean flag.

2792
02:03:16,730 --> 02:03:19,330
Black, white, red, and blue.

2793
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:22,169
When you watch it with the music,

2794
02:03:22,170 --> 02:03:24,940
there’s so much detail in the musicality.

2795
02:03:25,300 --> 02:03:28,639
- The difficulty of that is crazy. - Right.

2796
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:30,469
When the music went like this,

2797
02:03:30,470 --> 02:03:32,509
- they all moved like this. - Crazy!

2798
02:03:32,510 --> 02:03:33,979
They moved perfectly in sync with the sound.

2799
02:03:33,980 --> 02:03:35,410
The musicality was incredible.

2800
02:03:35,550 --> 02:03:37,250
And that's a high-level skill.

2801
02:03:37,380 --> 02:03:41,249
Every single move had its own unique bounce.

2802
02:03:41,250 --> 02:03:43,119
There’s a bounce that hits downward,

2803
02:03:43,120 --> 02:03:45,819
then one that pops upward, and even a bounce that pushes forward.

2804
02:03:45,820 --> 02:03:48,159
They mixed all these different bounces...

2805
02:03:48,160 --> 02:03:49,929
into the choreography,

2806
02:03:49,930 --> 02:03:51,400
so it doesn't get loose and boring.

2807
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:53,899
This is supposed to be the Mega Crew Mission,

2808
02:03:53,900 --> 02:03:57,130
and they completely went past what it is supposed to be.

2809
02:03:57,200 --> 02:03:58,300
They deserve a perfect score.

2810
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:03,909
BUMSUP crew received an overwhelming score...

2811
02:04:03,910 --> 02:04:07,549
of 1,195 out of a possible 1,200...

2812
02:04:07,550 --> 02:04:09,480
across the four evaluation categories.

2813
02:04:09,910 --> 02:04:11,019
(Tearing up)

2814
02:04:11,020 --> 02:04:12,779
- I'm tearing up. - I am too.

2815
02:04:12,780 --> 02:04:13,950
You are tearing up?

2816
02:04:14,050 --> 02:04:16,149
- You worked hard. - You worked really hard. Yes.

2817
02:04:16,150 --> 02:04:19,659
Finally, they are acknowledging us.

2818
02:04:19,660 --> 02:04:22,629
They acknowledged how much hard work we've put into it.

2819
02:04:22,630 --> 02:04:24,260
It gave me a sense of healing.

2820
02:04:24,600 --> 02:04:27,569
Honey J, as the leader and the creative director,

2821
02:04:27,570 --> 02:04:29,470
how are you feeling right now?

2822
02:04:29,700 --> 02:04:32,470
I'm over the moon, truly.

2823
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:34,670
I'm very grateful.

2824
02:04:35,170 --> 02:04:38,639
Once again, I want to thank the Korean dancers...

2825
02:04:38,640 --> 02:04:41,850
who worked with me on this Mega Crew Mission.

2826
02:04:42,150 --> 02:04:43,150
Thank you, all.

2827
02:04:43,151 --> 02:04:45,119
I will never forget this day.

2828
02:04:45,120 --> 02:04:46,350
I really appreciate it.

2829
02:04:46,550 --> 02:04:48,590
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2830
02:04:48,890 --> 02:04:51,319
There are too many people I want to thank.

2831
02:04:51,320 --> 02:04:54,589
I'm truly grateful to everyone at this moment.

2832
02:04:54,590 --> 02:04:55,860
I was so grateful.

2833
02:04:55,990 --> 02:04:57,490
I was super thrilled.

2834
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:00,260
With this,

2835
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:01,529
the fight judges' scores...

2836
02:05:01,530 --> 02:05:02,970
for all five crews’ Mega Crew Missions...

2837
02:05:03,070 --> 02:05:06,270
have now been revealed.

2838
02:05:07,470 --> 02:05:09,110
Currently in first place...

2839
02:05:09,510 --> 02:05:11,409
is Team Korea, BUMSUP.

2840
02:05:11,410 --> 02:05:12,640
We all worked hard.

2841
02:05:13,640 --> 02:05:14,880
That stresses me out.

2842
02:05:14,980 --> 02:05:18,019
That score is just ridiculous.

2843
02:05:18,020 --> 02:05:19,080
I'm scared.

2844
02:05:19,180 --> 02:05:21,319
I never want to fight another battle.

2845
02:05:21,320 --> 02:05:23,189
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's ranking: 4th place based on the fight judges' scores)

2846
02:05:23,190 --> 02:05:25,820
The crew in last place, ranked 5th,

2847
02:05:26,390 --> 02:05:29,590
is Team Australia, AG SQUAD.

2848
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:31,699
(A shocked laugh)

2849
02:05:31,700 --> 02:05:33,130
That's crazy.

2850
02:05:33,530 --> 02:05:34,630
It's okay.

2851
02:05:35,530 --> 02:05:37,169
We will take on the chance.

2852
02:05:37,170 --> 02:05:40,800
But no one can be sure of the final outcome.

2853
02:05:42,610 --> 02:05:44,239
- They could've at least done that. - That's true.

2854
02:05:44,240 --> 02:05:46,539
We just need to come third at least.

2855
02:05:46,540 --> 02:05:50,209
Will the yet-to-be-revealed Global Public Evaluation...

2856
02:05:50,210 --> 02:05:52,650
be enough to shake up the current rankings?

2857
02:05:53,120 --> 02:05:56,589
OSAKA Ojo Gang is currently ranking fourth,

2858
02:05:56,590 --> 02:06:00,059
and AG SQUAD is ranking fifth. If they fail to shake up...

2859
02:06:00,060 --> 02:06:02,260
the current rankings with the Global Public Evaluation,

2860
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:06,200
the two crews will go straight to the Elimination Battle.

2861
02:06:06,430 --> 02:06:08,929
We believe the viewers watching this show...

2862
02:06:08,930 --> 02:06:11,539
would know how eager we are to put in the work...

2863
02:06:11,540 --> 02:06:13,970
and to win this challenge.

2864
02:06:14,540 --> 02:06:16,940
We hope the result will be different.

2865
02:06:17,170 --> 02:06:20,979
I think we created a dope video.

2866
02:06:20,980 --> 02:06:22,079
- Yes. - And at the end of the day,

2867
02:06:22,080 --> 02:06:23,549
if we have to battle, we're ready.

2868
02:06:23,550 --> 02:06:27,350
It's your loss, so thank you.

2869
02:06:28,750 --> 02:06:29,790
That's wild.

2870
02:06:30,120 --> 02:06:31,160
Fight!

2871
02:06:31,990 --> 02:06:35,259
Now, we’ll reveal the final results...

2872
02:06:35,260 --> 02:06:37,859
by combining the fight judges' scores...

2873
02:06:37,860 --> 02:06:40,160
with the Global Public Evaluation.

2874
02:06:40,430 --> 02:06:44,499
I'll announce the crew that secured their spot in the semifinals...

2875
02:06:44,500 --> 02:06:45,800
I'm nervous.

2876
02:06:46,670 --> 02:06:47,710
Let's go.

2877
02:06:48,270 --> 02:06:51,540
The crew that placed first place will be revealed.

2878
02:06:52,210 --> 02:06:54,179
Team Korea?

2879
02:06:54,180 --> 02:06:55,280
BUMSUP.

2880
02:06:56,080 --> 02:06:59,480
Wouldn't it be strange if we didn't get the first place?

2881
02:07:00,150 --> 02:07:01,619
(Confident)

2882
02:07:01,620 --> 02:07:03,149
We weren't being arrogant.

2883
02:07:03,150 --> 02:07:05,060
We were just incredibly confident.

2884
02:07:05,120 --> 02:07:07,390
(I'm nervous.)

2885
02:07:07,590 --> 02:07:10,790
People must have a lot of reasons to like them.

2886
02:07:10,830 --> 02:07:13,660
It could completely flip the results around.

2887
02:07:14,130 --> 02:07:15,700
It makes me giggly.

2888
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,270
It's heart-pounding.

2889
02:07:18,100 --> 02:07:19,440
Which team is going to win?

2890
02:07:20,140 --> 02:07:23,540
The winner of the Mega Crew Mission is...

2891
02:07:24,010 --> 02:07:25,210
Who would win, if not us?

2892
02:07:26,110 --> 02:07:27,239
It's BUMSUP.

2893
02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:30,079
(BUMSUP ranks 1st in the Mega Crew Mission.)

2894
02:07:30,080 --> 02:07:31,850
(Thank you.)

2895
02:07:34,420 --> 02:07:36,650
(What's that?)

2896
02:07:46,200 --> 02:07:47,400
That's 1.6 million likes?

2897
02:07:47,800 --> 02:07:50,670
That's... 1.6 million?

2898
02:07:50,830 --> 02:07:53,169
- We got 1.6 million likes? - For the likes?

2899
02:07:53,170 --> 02:07:55,969
BUMSUP of Team Korea ranked first in the mission.

2900
02:07:55,970 --> 02:08:00,280
They got 12,219,013 views...

2901
02:08:00,510 --> 02:08:05,180
and 1,664,854 likes.

2902
02:08:05,580 --> 02:08:08,349
Across all of Mnet’s original dance series,

2903
02:08:08,350 --> 02:08:11,259
it never once lost the top spot...

2904
02:08:11,260 --> 02:08:14,159
in trending videos from the moment it was released...

2905
02:08:14,160 --> 02:08:16,189
until voting closed,

2906
02:08:16,190 --> 02:08:19,200
racking up the highest number of views and likes for the mission.

2907
02:08:19,860 --> 02:08:22,070
They got 1.66 million likes?

2908
02:08:22,430 --> 02:08:23,600
That's wild.

2909
02:08:24,230 --> 02:08:25,740
They got one million likes.

2910
02:08:26,570 --> 02:08:30,170
Do you know how hard it is to get in the millions for likes?

2911
02:08:30,770 --> 02:08:32,880
- That's crazy. - Yes.

2912
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:36,549
Receiving a total score of 2,395...

2913
02:08:36,550 --> 02:08:38,220
What?

2914
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:39,779
Amazing.

2915
02:08:39,780 --> 02:08:44,320
BUMSUP placed first in the Mega Crew Mission.

2916
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:46,720
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2917
02:08:47,490 --> 02:08:49,959
(Congratulations on placing 1st.)

2918
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:51,260
(Approved)

2919
02:08:52,900 --> 02:08:54,360
Thank you so much.

2920
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:56,929
This isn't the end.

2921
02:08:56,930 --> 02:08:59,499
We'll do our best to the end...

2922
02:08:59,500 --> 02:09:02,110
to prevent everyone's support going to waste.

2923
02:09:02,370 --> 02:09:04,370
We'll do our best. Thank you.

2924
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:10,049
Thank you so much for this.

2925
02:09:10,050 --> 02:09:12,519
It's the record I'd never get again in my life.

2926
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:15,990
- Seriously. - This will never happen again.

2927
02:09:16,790 --> 02:09:19,460
Before the door to the semifinal,

2928
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:22,930
the lowest rank in this mission will be...

2929
02:09:23,090 --> 02:09:25,230
the first to participate in the Elimination Battle.

2930
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:28,000
I will announce the crew that placed fifth.

2931
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:30,130
- What? - The lowest?

2932
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:32,800
Like that?

2933
02:09:33,400 --> 02:09:35,410
Right now, in the Mega Crew Mission,

2934
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:39,079
the crew with the lowest fight judges' score is AG SQUAD.

2935
02:09:39,080 --> 02:09:40,210
(AG SQUAD with the lowest fight judges' score)

2936
02:09:40,440 --> 02:09:42,249
I'm just upset.

2937
02:09:42,250 --> 02:09:45,880
So like, whatever the results are,

2938
02:09:46,250 --> 02:09:49,149
smile, cool, get back, and train.

2939
02:09:49,150 --> 02:09:51,790
Yes. Absolutely.

2940
02:09:51,890 --> 02:09:55,590
This is the time where we prove ourselves. You know what I mean?

2941
02:09:55,690 --> 02:09:58,060
For the Global Public Evaluation,

2942
02:09:58,360 --> 02:10:01,170
RHTokyo placed the bottom.

2943
02:10:01,730 --> 02:10:06,300
The fight judges' score gap between 2 crews is only 105.

2944
02:10:06,970 --> 02:10:08,210
Still offended though.

2945
02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:12,010
For example, with ROYAL FAMILY,

2946
02:10:12,580 --> 02:10:15,910
we were behind them in views, but we got more likes.

2947
02:10:17,980 --> 02:10:20,780
(The number of likes led them to win.)

2948
02:10:21,020 --> 02:10:25,990
So I hope that our likes help us bump up as well.

2949
02:10:26,260 --> 02:10:30,090
We received a high score from the fight judges.

2950
02:10:30,260 --> 02:10:33,900
I think we can turn the tables.

2951
02:10:34,230 --> 02:10:36,970
Or will it be OSAKA Ojo Gang?

2952
02:10:37,230 --> 02:10:39,239
Our fight judges' score was too low.

2953
02:10:39,240 --> 02:10:40,640
Wait. I'm not ready yet.

2954
02:10:41,670 --> 02:10:43,070
I'm scared.

2955
02:10:44,370 --> 02:10:46,739
If we have to do the Elimination Battle, please do your best.

2956
02:10:46,740 --> 02:10:48,809
(Serious)

2957
02:10:48,810 --> 02:10:50,850
It could be MOTIV.

2958
02:10:52,080 --> 02:10:56,720
That the public voting would make us suffer in the rankings.

2959
02:10:56,820 --> 02:10:58,760
And get us closer to the Elimination Battle.

2960
02:10:59,890 --> 02:11:04,560
The crew that ranked the lowest in the Mega Crew Mission is...

2961
02:11:05,230 --> 02:11:06,830
No. It can't be.

2962
02:11:07,030 --> 02:11:09,470
So I'm hoping our likes beat our views.

2963
02:11:09,570 --> 02:11:11,300
I feel confident.

2964
02:11:11,900 --> 02:11:14,300
I'm getting nervous.

2965
02:11:14,500 --> 02:11:17,270
Oh, my gosh.

2966
02:11:17,410 --> 02:11:19,280
The crew that placed fifth is...

2967
02:11:19,640 --> 02:11:24,180
(Nervous)

2968
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:25,619
AG SQUAD.

2969
02:11:25,620 --> 02:11:28,420
(AG SQUAD placed 5th in the Mega Crew Mission.)

2970
02:11:36,690 --> 02:11:39,299
(Gasping)

2971
02:11:39,300 --> 02:11:40,900
AG SQUAD...

2972
02:11:41,330 --> 02:11:45,740
recorded 3,913,997 views...

2973
02:11:46,270 --> 02:11:50,740
and 385,064 likes.

2974
02:11:51,810 --> 02:11:52,879
It's all right.

2975
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:55,910
It's okay. Calm down.

2976
02:11:57,380 --> 02:12:00,150
With a total score of 1,860,

2977
02:12:00,450 --> 02:12:03,420
they placed in the bottom rank.

2978
02:12:04,090 --> 02:12:05,360
This is crazy.

2979
02:12:08,230 --> 02:12:09,390
I hate this.

2980
02:12:11,260 --> 02:12:14,700
It's just... We put our heart and soul into this video.

2981
02:12:15,170 --> 02:12:18,200
You know they had groups like TWICE who were already famous.

2982
02:12:18,400 --> 02:12:20,969
So if we were more famous, our views would have been more,

2983
02:12:20,970 --> 02:12:23,170
and we wouldn't have gotten the lowest score.

2984
02:12:23,270 --> 02:12:26,310
AG SQUAD put their name...

2985
02:12:26,510 --> 02:12:28,179
on the Elimination Battle.

2986
02:12:28,180 --> 02:12:30,550
(AG SQUAD is guaranteed to join the Elimination Battle.)

2987
02:12:31,080 --> 02:12:32,880
Now, among the five crews,

2988
02:12:33,350 --> 02:12:37,250
MOTIV, OSAKA Ojo Gang, RHTokyo.

2989
02:12:37,620 --> 02:12:40,090
Only the three crews' results remain.

2990
02:12:40,590 --> 02:12:41,730
Among the three crews,

2991
02:12:41,930 --> 02:12:45,560
two crews will get a chance to join the semifinal.

2992
02:12:46,060 --> 02:12:49,430
The crew that placed fourth will enter the Elimination Battle.

2993
02:12:49,700 --> 02:12:50,970
This is a tighter game.

2994
02:12:51,300 --> 02:12:52,540
What's going to happen?

2995
02:12:53,240 --> 02:12:54,300
We're at risk.

2996
02:12:55,140 --> 02:12:56,910
Second place, please.

2997
02:12:57,410 --> 02:12:59,440
Is there any chance of us being fourth?

2998
02:12:59,540 --> 02:13:02,280
Yes. But I think they can still go down.

2999
02:13:02,910 --> 02:13:04,480
It's coming.

3000
02:13:05,180 --> 02:13:08,720
High likes, please, everyone.

3001
02:13:09,250 --> 02:13:12,420
Among these three crews, I will announce the crew...

3002
02:13:12,760 --> 02:13:17,260
who will enter the semifinal by placing second.

3003
02:13:17,560 --> 02:13:21,770
I will 1st reveal the number of likes the 2nd place received.

3004
02:13:23,100 --> 02:13:25,500
It's 440,094.

3005
02:13:26,470 --> 02:13:29,570
That's the number anyone can get.

3006
02:13:30,810 --> 02:13:32,440
It'll depend on the number of views.

3007
02:13:33,240 --> 02:13:34,639
(2nd in Global Public Evaluation, 4th in fight judges' score)

3008
02:13:34,640 --> 02:13:37,250
Isn't that too low? I don't think that's us.

3009
02:13:37,680 --> 02:13:40,320
That's crazy. We'll see.

3010
02:13:40,580 --> 02:13:44,050
I thought we'd still have a chance.

3011
02:13:44,620 --> 02:13:47,020
World of Street Woman Fighter Mega Crew Mission.

3012
02:13:47,120 --> 02:13:48,560
Just choose whatever.

3013
02:13:49,790 --> 02:13:51,560
Make us happy, will you?

3014
02:13:51,830 --> 02:13:52,830
Hurry up.

3015
02:13:54,230 --> 02:13:55,830
Second place goes to...

3016
02:13:56,430 --> 02:13:57,469
(Nervous)

3017
02:13:57,470 --> 02:13:58,670
You can go ahead.

3018
02:13:58,900 --> 02:13:59,900
Please.

3019
02:14:00,170 --> 02:14:02,540
MOTIV.

3020
02:14:03,110 --> 02:14:04,139
That's crazy.

3021
02:14:04,140 --> 02:14:06,380
(Touched)

3022
02:14:08,910 --> 02:14:10,550
- Oh, my gosh. - We survived another day.

3023
02:14:11,050 --> 02:14:12,350
We survived, right?

3024
02:14:15,890 --> 02:14:18,320
MOTIV...

3025
02:14:18,420 --> 02:14:22,060
recorded 4,259,445 views...

3026
02:14:22,630 --> 02:14:25,660
and 440,094 likes.

3027
02:14:26,030 --> 02:14:30,170
With the total score of 2,160, they placed second.

3028
02:14:30,630 --> 02:14:33,670
The number of views is never predictable.

3029
02:14:34,300 --> 02:14:36,909
The number of views can be about popularity...

3030
02:14:36,910 --> 02:14:40,509
or people really liked it.

3031
02:14:40,510 --> 02:14:43,450
Even within certain aspects of the competition,

3032
02:14:43,550 --> 02:14:46,250
to see this result, I am surprised.

3033
02:14:46,580 --> 02:14:47,620
I'm just proud.

3034
02:14:48,050 --> 02:14:50,450
I feel like we're proving who we are.

3035
02:14:53,920 --> 02:14:55,260
They're desperate.

3036
02:14:55,560 --> 02:14:57,060
OSAKA Ojo Gang thinks they're going to battle.

3037
02:14:57,390 --> 02:15:00,329
It happens to be Japan.

3038
02:15:00,330 --> 02:15:02,300
(Two crews from Japan remain.)

3039
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:09,240
(They were rivals from the start.)

3040
02:15:09,870 --> 02:15:12,479
(To be honest, we don't need two crews...)

3041
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:14,379
(to represent Japan.)

3042
02:15:14,380 --> 02:15:15,780
(Let's fight then.)

3043
02:15:16,450 --> 02:15:19,080
(OSAKA Ojo Gang lost to RHTokyo in the No Respect World Battle.)

3044
02:15:19,420 --> 02:15:22,889
(OSAKA Ojo Gang will be a stronger crew.)

3045
02:15:22,890 --> 02:15:24,250
(However)

3046
02:15:24,590 --> 02:15:26,959
(RHTokyo survived in the World of K-pop Mission.)

3047
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:30,760
(Whereas OSAKA Ojo Gang became the elimination candidate.)

3048
02:15:30,860 --> 02:15:32,730
(This is the worst experience in my life.)

3049
02:15:34,330 --> 02:15:35,669
(A...)

3050
02:15:35,670 --> 02:15:37,129
(A narrow...)

3051
02:15:37,130 --> 02:15:38,439
(A narrow escape...)

3052
02:15:38,440 --> 02:15:39,900
(A narrow escape from death)

3053
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,310
(After the neck-and-neck match in the Elimination Battle, )

3054
02:15:42,510 --> 02:15:44,770
(OSAKA Ojo Gang barely survived.)

3055
02:15:46,510 --> 02:15:48,110
I don't want the Elimination Battle.

3056
02:15:49,150 --> 02:15:50,650
I don't mind me doing the Elimination Battle.

3057
02:15:50,980 --> 02:15:52,580
But I don't want my team to do it.

3058
02:15:53,720 --> 02:15:55,549
The crew that always won.

3059
02:15:55,550 --> 02:15:58,820
And we're here to continue winning.

3060
02:15:59,260 --> 02:16:01,590
I wanted to prove ourselves.

3061
02:16:02,130 --> 02:16:03,860
Among the two remaining crews,

3062
02:16:03,960 --> 02:16:05,730
the crew that will enter the semifinal...

3063
02:16:05,830 --> 02:16:08,200
without the Elimination Battle is...

3064
02:16:08,530 --> 02:16:10,130
only one.

3065
02:16:10,330 --> 02:16:12,700
If the viewers gave us likes...

3066
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:16,470
I'm 100 percent confident...

3067
02:16:16,770 --> 02:16:18,140
that we will not be eliminated.

3068
02:16:19,540 --> 02:16:21,910
We feel really confident.

3069
02:16:22,350 --> 02:16:24,550
Shall we get ready for the battle?

3070
02:16:25,680 --> 02:16:28,079
(Anxious)

3071
02:16:28,080 --> 02:16:31,150
Then now, I will reveal RHTokyo...

3072
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:33,620
and OSAKA Ojo Gang's...

3073
02:16:34,460 --> 02:16:39,000
scores together.

3074
02:16:41,670 --> 02:16:43,630
Right away? Like that?

3075
02:16:44,170 --> 02:16:47,040
(Please)

3076
02:16:47,700 --> 02:16:48,769
When we compare the two,

3077
02:16:48,770 --> 02:16:52,639
OSAKA Ojo Gang was more impressive in the Mega Crew Mission.

3078
02:16:52,640 --> 02:16:54,040
(OSAKA Ojo Gang left a stronger impression.)

3079
02:16:54,340 --> 02:16:57,549
(Nervous)

3080
02:16:57,550 --> 02:17:01,750
Likes and views aren't about the Mega Crew Mission.

3081
02:17:01,850 --> 02:17:04,790
People watched what they thought was cool.

3082
02:17:05,160 --> 02:17:08,529
RHTokyo's was cooler.

3083
02:17:08,530 --> 02:17:09,530
Right.

3084
02:17:09,890 --> 02:17:12,530
OSAKA Ojo Gang's was rather ambiguous.

3085
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:16,330
The crew that placed fourth in the Mega Crew Mission is...

3086
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:18,540
Hurry.

3087
02:17:18,970 --> 02:17:20,240
I feel confident.

3088
02:17:20,870 --> 02:17:22,510
I knew we won.

3089
02:17:26,910 --> 02:17:29,710
(Which crew will be joining the Elimination Battle?)

3090
02:17:30,150 --> 02:17:33,580
The crew that placed fourth in the Mega Crew Mission is...

3091
02:17:40,660 --> 02:17:41,660
Good.

3092
02:17:43,230 --> 02:17:45,460
(Sad)

3093
02:17:45,700 --> 02:17:49,169
In the Global Public Evaluation, OSAKA Ojo Gang...

3094
02:17:49,170 --> 02:17:53,500
recorded 6,782,445 views...

3095
02:17:53,940 --> 02:17:57,669
and 698,600 likes.

3096
02:17:57,670 --> 02:18:00,210
With the total score of 2,105,

3097
02:18:00,510 --> 02:18:02,950
they placed third.

3098
02:18:03,650 --> 02:18:07,380
Next time, we'll do our best to place first solely with our skills.

3099
02:18:07,880 --> 02:18:11,319
In the Global Public Evaluation, RHTokyo...

3100
02:18:11,320 --> 02:18:15,390
recorded 3,603,304 views...

3101
02:18:16,060 --> 02:18:20,130
and 145,873 likes.

3102
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:23,070
With the total score of 1,865,

3103
02:18:23,470 --> 02:18:26,170
they placed fourth.

3104
02:18:27,170 --> 02:18:30,840
RHTokyo, please get ready for the Elimination Battle.

3105
02:18:31,110 --> 02:18:32,480
Let's fight then.

3106
02:18:32,780 --> 02:18:34,240
Time to battle.

3107
02:18:34,810 --> 02:18:36,010
Let's make it impactful.

3108
02:18:36,880 --> 02:18:39,119
I'm ready to smash them.

3109
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:40,120
Let's go.

3110
02:18:40,380 --> 02:18:44,950
The crews to join the second Elimination Battle are...

3111
02:18:45,260 --> 02:18:48,560
RHTokyo and AG SQUAD.

3112
02:18:49,060 --> 02:18:51,029
I feel very confident.

3113
02:18:51,030 --> 02:18:53,700
We'll be the one to remain in the final.

3114
02:18:53,900 --> 02:18:55,999
You know, show everyone why we're here...

3115
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:57,699
and why we're on this dance show.

3116
02:18:57,700 --> 02:19:00,440
And to make sure that we do not get eliminated.

3117
02:19:01,500 --> 02:19:02,910
(Elimination Battle)

3118
02:19:05,940 --> 02:19:08,179
(Let's do this.)

3119
02:19:08,180 --> 02:19:09,479
Sorry.

3120
02:19:09,480 --> 02:19:10,910
Don't be.

3121
02:19:11,950 --> 02:19:16,049
Due to injury, Rie can't participate.

3122
02:19:16,050 --> 02:19:19,660
I have responsibility as a leader.

3123
02:19:19,960 --> 02:19:22,890
I thought about pushing myself.

3124
02:19:23,160 --> 02:19:26,260
But Reina, Mona, Rico,

3125
02:19:26,500 --> 02:19:29,429
and everyone looked at me and said,

3126
02:19:29,430 --> 02:19:31,429
"Rie, get some rest."

3127
02:19:31,430 --> 02:19:35,110
"The seven of us will take care of it."

3128
02:19:35,510 --> 02:19:38,170
I felt really reliable.

3129
02:19:38,270 --> 02:19:40,740
That I can't join the battle with you...

3130
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:42,810
No.

3131
02:19:42,910 --> 02:19:46,050
Having you close gives us the power.

3132
02:19:48,150 --> 02:19:49,450
The tear gland plug.

3133
02:19:49,690 --> 02:19:51,190
What?

3134
02:19:52,190 --> 02:19:53,260
It's close.

3135
02:19:53,620 --> 02:19:56,060
(Bursting into tears due to mixed emotions)

3136
02:19:56,430 --> 02:19:57,690
It feels...

3137
02:19:57,960 --> 02:20:00,900
My makeup is already ruined.

3138
02:20:01,700 --> 02:20:02,700
It's annoying.

3139
02:20:04,270 --> 02:20:05,940
(Rie Hata forces herself to smile to loosen up the mood.)

3140
02:20:06,240 --> 02:20:09,970
You did your best to make it, Rie.

3141
02:20:12,110 --> 02:20:14,340
So I don't want to lose.

3142
02:20:16,380 --> 02:20:18,480
We must win.

3143
02:20:18,550 --> 02:20:21,789
RHTokyo will win no matter what.

3144
02:20:21,790 --> 02:20:23,389
We kept winning,

3145
02:20:23,390 --> 02:20:26,860
and we're here to continue winning.

3146
02:20:27,560 --> 02:20:28,729
We'll win no matter what...

3147
02:20:28,730 --> 02:20:30,529
and take Rie to the final.

3148
02:20:30,530 --> 02:20:32,259
(Shouting)

3149
02:20:32,260 --> 02:20:33,260
I want to win.

3150
02:20:33,700 --> 02:20:35,800
Please take care of it today, today's leader Reina.

3151
02:20:35,870 --> 02:20:36,929
Yes.

3152
02:20:36,930 --> 02:20:38,669
(The goal is to enter the final.)

3153
02:20:38,670 --> 02:20:40,739
All for the final.

3154
02:20:40,740 --> 02:20:41,740
- Yes. - Yes.

3155
02:20:41,741 --> 02:20:43,109
- Let's nail it with joy. - Yes.

3156
02:20:43,110 --> 02:20:44,169
Let's nail it with joy.

3157
02:20:44,170 --> 02:20:45,809
(Roaring)

3158
02:20:45,810 --> 02:20:48,239
- RHTokyo. - RHTokyo.

3159
02:20:48,240 --> 02:20:50,379
(Let's go.)

3160
02:20:50,380 --> 02:20:52,119
(They still can't believe the Mega Crew Mission result.)

3161
02:20:52,120 --> 02:20:54,880
We feel like it just hurts.

3162
02:20:55,450 --> 02:20:57,490
What we're representing which is Australia.

3163
02:20:59,160 --> 02:21:00,419
We got this. We're prepared.

3164
02:21:00,420 --> 02:21:02,059
I think we stand a good chance...

3165
02:21:02,060 --> 02:21:03,890
as long as we just stick to what we're good at.

3166
02:21:04,060 --> 02:21:05,759
Absolutely. We got this.

3167
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:09,330
Yes, we're angry. And yes, we're hungry, but...

3168
02:21:09,470 --> 02:21:12,369
let's shift it and just project that.

3169
02:21:12,370 --> 02:21:14,669
- In funness. - Yes.

3170
02:21:14,670 --> 02:21:17,739
We really feel like we got what it takes to beat RHTokyo.

3171
02:21:17,740 --> 02:21:20,809
This is our time to show why we're here.

3172
02:21:20,810 --> 02:21:23,449
We're getting so much stronger as a team and as a unit.

3173
02:21:23,450 --> 02:21:26,349
I feel like we have what it takes to win this.

3174
02:21:26,350 --> 02:21:28,350
Go on next stage, and I'm going to kill it.

3175
02:21:28,820 --> 02:21:30,789
- Shall we pray? - Yes.

3176
02:21:30,790 --> 02:21:33,619
Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,

3177
02:21:33,620 --> 02:21:37,089
your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as in heaven.

3178
02:21:37,090 --> 02:21:38,459
Give us today our daily bread.

3179
02:21:38,460 --> 02:21:41,559
And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.

3180
02:21:41,560 --> 02:21:43,229
- In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen. - Amen.

3181
02:21:43,230 --> 02:21:44,330
- Amen. - Let's go.

3182
02:21:44,970 --> 02:21:46,470
Let's go.

3183
02:21:47,500 --> 02:21:49,010
(Elimination Battle)

3184
02:21:49,140 --> 02:21:51,909
We will now begin the second Elimination Battle...

3185
02:21:51,910 --> 02:21:54,310
to decide the second eliminated crew.

3186
02:21:55,250 --> 02:21:57,010
We can't lose. We need to win.

3187
02:21:57,310 --> 02:21:58,919
I feel confident about winning.

3188
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:00,949
RHTokyo won.

3189
02:22:00,950 --> 02:22:03,589
We'll win the group battle no matter what.

3190
02:22:03,590 --> 02:22:05,360
They wrapped her...

3191
02:22:05,860 --> 02:22:06,860
and ate it.

3192
02:22:06,861 --> 02:22:09,889
Team Japan RHTokyo won.

3193
02:22:09,890 --> 02:22:12,559
I didn't agree with the judges' scores at all.

3194
02:22:12,560 --> 02:22:15,029
The crew that has to leave is...

3195
02:22:15,030 --> 02:22:16,129
(Who will be the only crew to survive the Elimination Battle?)

3196

It's the Global Artist Performance Mission.

3200
02:22:31,010 --> 02:22:33,249

(The slogans for all 5 crews are ready.)

3208
02:22:53,440 --> 02:22:55,069
Ojo!

3209
02:22:55,070 --> 02:22:56,169

3210
02:22:56,170 --> 02:22:59,110
- Go, RHTokyo. - Go, RHTokyo.

3211

3212
02:23:05,720 --> 02:23:07,820
(It's filled with the fans' energy.)

3213
02:23:08,280 --> 02:23:09,520
Nice to meet you.

3214
02:23:10,020 --> 02:23:11,549

3215
02:23:11,550 --> 02:23:15,090
(Make some noise!)

3216
02:23:15,360 --> 02:23:18,959
- Han Bin. - Oh, my.

3217
02:23:18,960 --> 02:23:19,960
Oh, my.

(Smiling automatically)

3219
02:23:22,170 --> 02:23:24,269
The global dance battle for the pride...

3220
02:23:24,270 --> 02:23:25,939
of the strong girls around the world.

3221
02:23:25,940 --> 02:23:27,900
World of Street Woman Fighter.

3222
02:23:29,040 --> 02:23:33,840
Today, another crew will leave World of Street Woman Fighter.

3223
02:23:33,980 --> 02:23:35,710
No.

3224
02:23:36,110 --> 02:23:37,110
Don't be nervous.

3225
02:23:37,250 --> 02:23:40,219
Let me introduce the special judge...

Let's go.

3256

(Bouncing)

3257
02:25:10,370 --> 02:25:11,670
(That's crazy.)

3258
02:25:12,310 --> 02:25:13,480

(Is this real?)

3269
02:25:39,470 --> 02:25:42,370
Let's go!

3270
02:25:46,110 --> 02:25:48,710

Let's go.

3277
02:26:08,200 --> 02:26:09,200
Goodness.

That's why you got a medal.

3281
02:26:16,110 --> 02:26:17,240
(Fantastic)

3282
02:26:17,370 --> 02:26:18,810
They're strong judges.

We'll now begin the Elimination Battle.

3284
02:26:24,380 --> 02:26:26,620
Two crews are standing on the edge of the survival.

3285
02:26:27,480 --> 02:26:30,690
Who will be the one to win the survival battle?

3286
02:26:31,250 --> 02:26:32,660
Let's win the first match. No matter what.

3287
02:26:34,120 --> 02:26:35,420
Let's start from there.

3288
02:26:35,730 --> 02:26:39,160
Who will be the second crew to leave this place?

3289
02:26:39,500 --> 02:26:40,560
We're not going to be eliminated.

3290
02:26:40,800 --> 02:26:42,230
- We will win. - We got it.

3291
02:26:42,570 --> 02:26:45,270
The first elimination candidate to battle is...

3292
02:26:45,870 --> 02:26:47,600

02:26:47,740 --> 02:26:48,740

3294
02:26:49,770 --> 02:26:51,510
It's RHTokyo.

3295
02:26:52,210 --> 02:26:56,780

- Let's go. - Tokyo.

3300
02:27:07,560 --> 02:27:09,230
I feel confident about winning.

3301
02:27:09,590 --> 02:27:12,130
We'll be the ones to join the final.

3302
02:27:12,630 --> 02:27:13,999
They must hate it.

3303
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:15,630
I hated it so much.

3304
02:27:16,230 --> 02:27:17,630
So this is what other crews saw.

3305
02:27:18,670 --> 02:27:21,700
The second elimination candidate in the Elimination Battle is...

3306
02:27:21,970 --> 02:27:23,810

It's AG SQUAD.

3309
02:27:28,440 --> 02:27:33,579
(AG SQUAD's theme song, "All In AUS")

3310
02:27:33,580 --> 02:27:35,690
(Oi!)

3311
02:27:36,090 --> 02:27:37,720
Let's go.

3312
02:27:38,890 --> 02:27:40,720
We're confident in ourselves.

3313
02:27:41,120 --> 02:27:42,430
I think we will win.

3314
02:27:43,490 --> 02:27:44,689
(Dancing)

3315
02:27:44,690 --> 02:27:46,230
AG SQUAD!

3316
02:27:48,560 --> 02:27:50,530
They must be so nervous right now.

3317
02:27:51,700 --> 02:27:54,939
AG SQUAD is here to put up a fight...

3318
02:27:54,940 --> 02:27:58,980
because we want to win.

3319
02:27:59,240 --> 02:28:00,440
Don't get intimidated.

3320
02:28:00,880 --> 02:28:02,780
We're not failing. We're winning.

3321
02:28:03,310 --> 02:28:04,750
Today...

3322
02:28:05,920 --> 02:28:07,579
Reina is the leader.

3323
02:28:07,580 --> 02:28:09,289
(It doesn't matter who the leader is.)

3324
02:28:09,290 --> 02:28:11,050
Reina has battle experience.

3325
02:28:12,260 --> 02:28:13,959
So I know they are going to kill it.

3326
02:28:13,960 --> 02:28:15,929
Without me, or no matter what.

3327
02:28:15,930 --> 02:28:17,589
And I trust them...

3328
02:28:17,590 --> 02:28:19,529
to let them kill it.

3329
02:28:19,530 --> 02:28:21,400
I'm confident that we will win.

3330
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:24,330
I'm like, "Watch what we've got."

3331
02:28:24,430 --> 02:28:26,700
(Go, RHTokyo!)

3332
02:28:26,900 --> 02:28:29,270
Just watching them makes me nervous.

3333
02:28:29,370 --> 02:28:33,040
The elimination battle will be held as a best-of-five,

3334
02:28:33,240 --> 02:28:36,049
and the first showdown to kick things off...

3335
02:28:36,050 --> 02:28:37,480
will be the group battle.

3336
02:28:37,610 --> 02:28:40,920
Round 2 will be a 2-on-2 duet battle.

3337
02:28:41,050 --> 02:28:44,419
Each crew will send out their strongest duo...

3338
02:28:44,420 --> 02:28:45,890
to face off in the battle.

3339
02:28:46,020 --> 02:28:47,719
Maybe, they will send out Vanessa and Aaliyah.

3340
02:28:47,720 --> 02:28:48,890
This will be fun.

3341
02:28:49,330 --> 02:28:51,859
Round 3 will be a 1-on-1 battle.

3342
02:28:51,860 --> 02:28:55,559
After hearing the music, the dancer who feels most confident...

3343
02:28:55,560 --> 02:28:57,170
will step up and battle.

3344
02:28:57,700 --> 02:29:00,869
Round 4 will be a 2-on-2 duet battle.

3345
02:29:00,870 --> 02:29:04,540
Round 5, the last round, will be a 1-on-1 battle.

3346
02:29:05,010 --> 02:29:08,780
The elimination battle will be held as a best-of-five.

3347
02:29:08,980 --> 02:29:13,080
The 1st crew to win 3 rounds will secure their survival,

3348
02:29:13,220 --> 02:29:15,650
and the battle will end immediately.

3349
02:29:15,920 --> 02:29:17,150
One, one, one, we're done.

3350
02:29:18,420 --> 02:29:20,260
Fight Judge Park Jin Young.

3351
02:29:21,190 --> 02:29:24,230
What are today's judging criteria?

3352
02:29:24,430 --> 02:29:27,999
I want to see teamwork and fierce determination...

3353
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:31,430
as you fight with everything you've got to survive.

3354
02:29:32,170 --> 02:29:37,309
I'll be focusing on which crew looks cooler and more impressive.

3355
02:29:37,310 --> 02:29:40,609
So please, give it everything you have...

3356
02:29:40,610 --> 02:29:42,080
and show us your best.

3357
02:29:42,510 --> 02:29:44,979
Moving quality, first and foremost. It's a dance as well.

3358
02:29:44,980 --> 02:29:46,579
So how well you connect it to the music,

3359
02:29:46,580 --> 02:29:47,949
especially with the freestyle rounds.

3360
02:29:47,950 --> 02:29:49,720
Yes. Those are the things I will be looking for.

3361
02:29:51,050 --> 02:29:53,919
I was on that stage last year.

3362
02:29:53,920 --> 02:29:57,029
The most important thing is that it ends...

3363
02:29:57,030 --> 02:29:59,029
without any of the dancers getting injured.

3364
02:29:59,030 --> 02:30:00,500
Good luck, AG SQUAD.

3365
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
Good luck, RHTokyo.

3366
02:30:03,070 --> 02:30:04,530
Let's go!

3367
02:30:04,600 --> 02:30:07,270
It's actually a good group of people.

3368
02:30:08,540 --> 02:30:11,639
So ladies, as you may know,

3369
02:30:11,640 --> 02:30:14,309
there are certain unspoken rules in this space.

3370
02:30:14,310 --> 02:30:16,249
Let's honor each other.

3371
02:30:16,250 --> 02:30:17,709
- Yes. - Let's honor...

3372
02:30:17,710 --> 02:30:18,909
- Absolutely. - Respect the dancers,

3373
02:30:18,910 --> 02:30:20,119
and respect the floor.

3374
02:30:20,120 --> 02:30:21,220
Of course.

3375
02:30:21,820 --> 02:30:23,550
- You're great! - Okay.

3376
02:30:23,720 --> 02:30:25,920
Respect everybody. Respect the floor.

3377
02:30:27,220 --> 02:30:30,489
Now, World of Street Woman Fighter.

3378
02:30:30,490 --> 02:30:33,260
It's time to decide the second crew to be eliminated.

3379
02:30:33,860 --> 02:30:36,430
Round One of the Elimination Battle...

3380
02:30:37,130 --> 02:30:38,200
is a team battle.

3381
02:30:39,770 --> 02:30:41,070
It's started.

3382
02:30:41,200 --> 02:30:42,910
Getting consecutive wins is really important.

3383
02:30:43,770 --> 02:30:45,410
If you can't bring them down,

3384
02:30:46,010 --> 02:30:47,140
you'll go down yourself.

3385
02:30:48,580 --> 02:30:50,680
We're focusing on crew work.

3386
02:30:51,080 --> 02:30:53,280
We're focusing on being a team.

3387
02:30:54,480 --> 02:30:57,649
We need teamwork to be winning in the crew battle.

3388
02:30:57,650 --> 02:31:00,089
We trust each other.

3389
02:31:00,090 --> 02:31:02,190
I am confident that we will win.

3390
02:31:02,220 --> 02:31:04,230
We can't lose. We need to win.

3391
02:31:04,930 --> 02:31:07,260
Both teams will do well.

3392
02:31:07,630 --> 02:31:10,900
We'll decide who goes first by spinning a bottle.

3393
02:31:11,270 --> 02:31:12,330
Don't be nervous.

3394
02:31:16,340 --> 02:31:17,739
(AG SQUAD goes first.)

3395
02:31:17,740 --> 02:31:20,009
- AG SQUAD will go first. - Let's go,

3396
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:22,409
- AG! - RHTokyo will go second.

3397
02:31:22,410 --> 02:31:23,850
Go, Nina!

3398
02:31:23,910 --> 02:31:25,150
Go, girls!

3399
02:31:25,310 --> 02:31:28,419
I was expecting them to come in with powerful choreography,

3400
02:31:28,420 --> 02:31:29,550
full of intensity.

3401
02:31:30,390 --> 02:31:34,219
They stick to the hip-hop, gangster vibe.

3402
02:31:34,220 --> 02:31:35,929
So we were very well prepared.

3403
02:31:35,930 --> 02:31:38,459
We made sure we were different to what they were bringing.

3404
02:31:38,460 --> 02:31:40,899
I feel like if we did hip-hop,

3405
02:31:40,900 --> 02:31:42,230
it would look the same.

3406
02:31:42,970 --> 02:31:45,569
- Let's go! - AG!

3407
02:31:45,570 --> 02:31:47,440
They must be so nervous.

3408
02:31:48,170 --> 02:31:50,069
Let's go, AG!

3409
02:31:50,070 --> 02:31:51,270
World of Street Woman Fighter.

3410
02:31:51,410 --> 02:31:54,010
The moment that will decide the fate of the second elimination.

3411
02:31:54,340 --> 02:31:55,710
It begins now.

3412
02:31:56,580 --> 02:31:59,010
- Let's go! - Okay, let's go!

3413
02:32:00,320 --> 02:32:01,550
You guys ready?

3414
02:32:02,350 --> 02:32:03,350
Fight!

3415
02:32:06,060 --> 02:32:07,820
(AG SQUAD attacks 1st in the Round 1 Team Battle.)

3416
02:32:11,260 --> 02:32:12,260
Here they come.

3417
02:32:14,730 --> 02:32:16,670
(Thrilled)

3418
02:32:16,700 --> 02:32:19,270
It wasn't anything we didn't expect.

3419
02:32:22,170 --> 02:32:24,170
We were just going crazy.

3420
02:32:26,380 --> 02:32:27,380
(Pound it well...)

3421
02:32:27,381 --> 02:32:29,250
(and chew it off.)

3422
02:32:32,310 --> 02:32:34,479
"Don't mind them at all."

3423
02:32:34,480 --> 02:32:36,550
It was just as we imagined.

3424
02:32:41,590 --> 02:32:42,730
Focus.

3425
02:32:44,260 --> 02:32:46,029
We just need to bring out our strengths.

3426
02:32:46,030 --> 02:32:47,030
(AG SQUAD prepared props.)

3427
02:32:47,031 --> 02:32:49,830
We expected them to use props.

3428
02:32:50,030 --> 02:32:51,070
That's it!

3429
02:32:53,840 --> 02:32:55,440
Wild!

3430
02:32:55,700 --> 02:32:58,769
We wanted a fierce, head-to-head battle...

3431
02:32:58,770 --> 02:33:00,440
between the dancers.

3432
02:33:01,080 --> 02:33:03,650
We turned because we were like, "You aren't more important to us."

3433
02:33:04,510 --> 02:33:06,650
(AG SQUAD dances facing the judges.)

3434
02:33:09,250 --> 02:33:10,750
Danica!

3435
02:33:11,520 --> 02:33:13,260
I think we're ready to showcase that.

3436
02:33:14,020 --> 02:33:17,589
The countdown. Five, four...

3437
02:33:17,590 --> 02:33:18,860
Oh, my gosh.

3438
02:33:19,030 --> 02:33:20,030
Kill it.

3439
02:33:20,031 --> 02:33:21,759
Leave everything on the dance floor.

3440
02:33:21,760 --> 02:33:22,770
(Screaming)

3441
02:33:23,800 --> 02:33:26,439
Honestly, I couldn't see what the formation was...

3442
02:33:26,440 --> 02:33:28,070
or what the choreography was supposed to be.

3443
02:33:28,540 --> 02:33:31,639
Three, two, one.

3444
02:33:31,640 --> 02:33:33,579
Switch. RHTokyo.

3445
02:33:33,580 --> 02:33:34,680
(RHTokyo attacks 2nd in the Round 1 Team Battle.)

3446
02:33:34,710 --> 02:33:36,210
Let's go!

3447
02:33:37,680 --> 02:33:40,050
We will show you. We will.

3448
02:33:41,250 --> 02:33:42,250
(Spreading out...)

3449
02:33:42,251 --> 02:33:43,289
(to get the crowd hyped)

3450
02:33:43,290 --> 02:33:44,390
(Hyped up)

3451
02:33:47,590 --> 02:33:50,729
I did expect them to do the gangster style.

3452
02:33:50,730 --> 02:33:53,159
We decided to fight them head-on...

3453
02:33:53,160 --> 02:33:55,059
with our dance, without using any props.

3454
02:33:55,060 --> 02:33:57,470
We created a routine full of powerful energy.

3455
02:33:57,730 --> 02:33:59,440
We are extremely confident.

3456
02:34:00,300 --> 02:34:01,300
Let's go!

3457
02:34:01,870 --> 02:34:02,870
Hey!

3458
02:34:03,110 --> 02:34:04,170
Go, Reina!

3459
02:34:04,970 --> 02:34:06,010
No pressure.

3460
02:34:06,440 --> 02:34:07,940
We will do our dance.

3461
02:34:08,540 --> 02:34:09,680
Let's go!

3462
02:34:10,910 --> 02:34:12,650
I thought we rocked.

3463
02:34:14,350 --> 02:34:15,750
I have no idea.

3464
02:34:22,120 --> 02:34:23,629
(Gather it up, )

3465
02:34:23,630 --> 02:34:25,999
(then take it in one big bite.)

3466
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:27,159
No!

3467
02:34:27,160 --> 02:34:28,230
I'm angry.

3468
02:34:28,960 --> 02:34:31,599
It's our signature move.

3469
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:34,100
It's similar to what they do.

3470
02:34:34,600 --> 02:34:37,970
The countdown. Five, four, three...

3471
02:34:38,240 --> 02:34:39,380
It's like pouring fuel on fire.

3472
02:34:39,680 --> 02:34:42,849
Three, two, one.

3473
02:34:42,850 --> 02:34:44,949
Battle over.

3474
02:34:44,950 --> 02:34:46,649
(Eating AG)

3475
02:34:46,650 --> 02:34:47,820
That's ridiculous.

3476
02:34:49,690 --> 02:34:51,350
They wrapped AG...

3477
02:34:51,850 --> 02:34:53,859
- and ate it. - Battle over.

3478
02:34:53,860 --> 02:34:56,689
(Round 1 Team Battle is over.)

3479
02:34:56,690 --> 02:34:58,989
- The energy is incredible. - It was like a movie.

3480
02:34:58,990 --> 02:35:00,760
They did a great job, as expected.

3481
02:35:01,030 --> 02:35:02,160
Both teams are so good.

3482
02:35:03,070 --> 02:35:06,769
That bounce, the teamwork, and the swagger.

3483
02:35:06,770 --> 02:35:08,269
This is RHTokyo.

3484
02:35:08,270 --> 02:35:10,440
My family never lets me down.

3485
02:35:10,640 --> 02:35:11,640
Rie.

3486
02:35:12,640 --> 02:35:15,179
Rie, can you see well?

3487
02:35:15,180 --> 02:35:18,309
You will get a better view there. Do you want to move there?

3488
02:35:18,310 --> 02:35:19,950
Really? Thank you.

3489
02:35:22,790 --> 02:35:25,089
- This is the center. - It's hard to see from there.

3490
02:35:25,090 --> 02:35:27,060
You will get a better view from here, the center.

3491
02:35:27,320 --> 02:35:29,089
Yes!

3492
02:35:29,090 --> 02:35:30,190
(A front-row seat to the crews’ friendship)

3493
02:35:31,260 --> 02:35:33,399
(Moved)

3494
02:35:33,400 --> 02:35:35,329
(Thank you!)

3495
02:35:35,330 --> 02:35:39,269
(Respect for each other shining through the intense battle)

3496
02:35:39,270 --> 02:35:43,040
Now, let's check the result of the battle.

3497
02:35:43,610 --> 02:35:47,110
I was confident that our routine was better.

3498
02:35:47,480 --> 02:35:50,110
I definitely think that we can win.

3499
02:35:50,580 --> 02:35:51,679
To be honest with you,

3500
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:54,980
The issue was that AG didn't have a strong end.

3501
02:35:55,950 --> 02:35:58,650
First, RHTokyo had...

3502
02:35:58,920 --> 02:36:01,719
the strongest teamwork.

3503
02:36:01,720 --> 02:36:05,889
However, they showcased a lot of the old moves.

3504
02:36:05,890 --> 02:36:07,729
The moves we could expect from them.

3505
02:36:07,730 --> 02:36:08,930
(Their routine felt predictable and similar to their previous one.)

3506
02:36:11,170 --> 02:36:12,499
AG SQUAD used...

3507
02:36:12,500 --> 02:36:14,369
the black prop, the strap,

3508
02:36:14,370 --> 02:36:16,409
but it was hard to see.

3509
02:36:16,410 --> 02:36:19,579
Perhaps it would've been better...

3510
02:36:19,580 --> 02:36:22,009
if they were used in a more obvious manner.

3511
02:36:22,010 --> 02:36:24,179
But both teams were very well prepared.

3512
02:36:24,180 --> 02:36:27,419
I was able to enjoy the first round to the fullest.

3513
02:36:27,420 --> 02:36:28,449
Thank you.

3514
02:36:28,450 --> 02:36:29,919
(They have experience in the elimination battle.)

3515
02:36:29,920 --> 02:36:30,990
Reina did well.

3516
02:36:31,590 --> 02:36:34,490
I hope nobody goes home.

3517
02:36:36,260 --> 02:36:39,229
Now, we will reveal the cards...

3518
02:36:39,230 --> 02:36:41,960
of all five special judges at the same time.

3519
02:36:44,900 --> 02:36:47,599
I feel very confident to beat RHTokyo...

3520
02:36:47,600 --> 02:36:49,270
after doing the group battle.

3521
02:36:49,370 --> 02:36:51,110
We are strong.

3522
02:36:51,910 --> 02:36:54,279
All seven of us are fired up...

3523
02:36:54,280 --> 02:36:57,349
with the determination to win,

3524
02:36:57,350 --> 02:36:58,580
so we’re feeling confident.

3525
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:00,580
Fight judges.

3526
02:37:01,480 --> 02:37:03,790
Oh, my gosh.

3527
02:37:08,220 --> 02:37:09,960
Open your cards.

3528
02:37:17,570 --> 02:37:20,069
(AG SQUAD wins the Round 1 team battle.)

3529
02:37:20,070 --> 02:37:22,039
It’s a 5 to 0 victory...

3530
02:37:22,040 --> 02:37:25,740
for Team Australia, AG SQUAD.

3531
02:37:26,480 --> 02:37:28,339
- Let's go! - It's not done.

3532
02:37:28,340 --> 02:37:30,349
- It's not done. - Let's go.

3533
02:37:30,350 --> 02:37:32,410
- This is only the beginning. - It is.

3534
02:37:32,880 --> 02:37:34,850
Let's win the next round.

3535
02:37:35,650 --> 02:37:36,889
It was a good battle.

3536
02:37:36,890 --> 02:37:39,759
The impact was so strong right at the start when they burst out.

3537
02:37:39,760 --> 02:37:40,859
The energy is absolutely insane.

3538
02:37:40,860 --> 02:37:44,660
I think RHTokyo will get ahead in the next two rounds.

3539
02:37:45,130 --> 02:37:48,759
If they really dig into their power, they can do well!

3540
02:37:48,760 --> 02:37:50,530
- They can. - You know what I'm saying?

3541
02:37:51,170 --> 02:37:54,670
I felt a strange kind of tension I've never experienced before.

3542
02:37:55,900 --> 02:37:58,040
Next up, Round Two will be...

3543
02:37:58,140 --> 02:38:00,609
a 2-on-2 duet battle.

3544
02:38:00,610 --> 02:38:01,610
Oh, my gosh.

3545
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:02,709
(Insane!)

3546
02:38:02,710 --> 02:38:03,710
What battle?

3547
02:38:03,711 --> 02:38:04,910
(2-on-2 duet battle!)

3548
02:38:06,320 --> 02:38:08,420
We have to win this second round no matter what.

3549
02:38:08,880 --> 02:38:11,220
We've got two more wins, and then we're winning.

3550
02:38:11,320 --> 02:38:14,360
Each crew will listen to the music,

3551
02:38:14,460 --> 02:38:18,459
and their two most confident dancers will step up to battle.

3552
02:38:18,460 --> 02:38:20,459
You and Vanessa stay handy too.

3553
02:38:20,460 --> 02:38:21,729
You be the decoy.

3554
02:38:21,730 --> 02:38:23,269
Okay. I will be the decoy.

3555
02:38:23,270 --> 02:38:27,070
We need power, so let's keep popping and krumping in mind.

3556
02:38:29,140 --> 02:38:31,009
(AG SQUAD attacks first.)

3557
02:38:31,010 --> 02:38:32,669
AG SQUAD will attack first.

3558
02:38:32,670 --> 02:38:34,739
They did well even when they attacked first.

3559
02:38:34,740 --> 02:38:35,810
Be strong.

3560
02:38:36,980 --> 02:38:38,349
I'm so excited.

3561
02:38:38,350 --> 02:38:40,150
Now the friendly vibes are over.

3562
02:38:41,750 --> 02:38:42,780
Go, girls.

3563
02:38:46,960 --> 02:38:48,190
Let's go, Mommy.

3564
02:38:48,390 --> 02:38:52,390
A do-or-die 2-on-2 battle with both crews' fates on the line.

3565
02:38:53,330 --> 02:38:55,630
It begins now.

3566
02:38:56,700 --> 02:38:58,230
Let's go!

3567
02:38:58,430 --> 02:39:00,969
We can't afford to lose this round.

3568
02:39:00,970 --> 02:39:03,440
We absolutely have to win this one.

3569
02:39:03,810 --> 02:39:06,509
Let's hope that we are going on a winning streak.

3570
02:39:06,510 --> 02:39:08,410
We're ready to just kill it.

3571
02:39:08,740 --> 02:39:09,880
You guys ready?

3572
02:39:10,780 --> 02:39:11,780
Fight!

3573
02:39:12,180 --> 02:39:13,550
Bring it on!

3574
02:39:14,020 --> 02:39:16,889
Let's go!

3575
02:39:16,890 --> 02:39:18,989
I got it.

3576
02:39:18,990 --> 02:39:20,319
(All eyes...)

3577
02:39:20,320 --> 02:39:22,089
(on them)

3578
02:39:22,090 --> 02:39:23,130
Hurry!

3579
02:39:23,660 --> 02:39:24,660
Who is it going to be?

3580
02:39:27,060 --> 02:39:28,760
Vanessa and I were going out.

3581
02:39:30,400 --> 02:39:32,270
(Excited)

3582
02:39:33,340 --> 02:39:34,470
Let's go!

3583
02:39:34,870 --> 02:39:36,470
Vanessa and I were going out.

3584
02:39:37,810 --> 02:39:39,640
We created that surprise.

3585
02:39:40,740 --> 02:39:42,009
(Kaea and Ruthy Baby)

3586
02:39:42,010 --> 02:39:43,310
It didn't surprise me much.

3587
02:39:43,910 --> 02:39:45,009
What?

3588
02:39:45,010 --> 02:39:46,320
(Surprise)

3589
02:39:46,720 --> 02:39:48,020
(I see.)

3590
02:39:49,890 --> 02:39:51,650
We created that surprise.

3591
02:39:52,520 --> 02:39:53,820
Bring it on.

3592
02:39:54,190 --> 02:39:56,260
What sisters can dance like this?

3593
02:40:00,900 --> 02:40:01,900
We ate.

3594
02:40:03,330 --> 02:40:04,330
Eat them.

3595
02:40:05,070 --> 02:40:06,800
There's no highlight.

3596
02:40:07,170 --> 02:40:08,170
(Munching)

3597
02:40:13,640 --> 02:40:14,980
(Look at that energy.)

3598
02:40:17,450 --> 02:40:19,079
Good energy all around.

3599
02:40:19,080 --> 02:40:21,120
They couldn't catch the subtle sounds.

3600
02:40:26,720 --> 02:40:28,460
It was amazing battling with her.

3601
02:40:28,660 --> 02:40:30,390
They weren't that good.

3602
02:40:30,960 --> 02:40:32,530
She's just an amazing dancer.

3603
02:40:36,100 --> 02:40:37,100
(Focusing)

3604
02:40:39,970 --> 02:40:42,399
We've prepared, and it's showing.

3605
02:40:42,400 --> 02:40:44,070
It didn't make me anxious at all.

3606
02:40:48,080 --> 02:40:49,849
Coming for attack.

3607
02:40:49,850 --> 02:40:51,550
Five, four...

3608
02:40:52,380 --> 02:40:53,380
(Screaming)

3609
02:40:53,520 --> 02:40:54,520
We did well.

3610
02:40:54,521 --> 02:40:57,090
Two, one. Switch.

3611
02:40:57,790 --> 02:41:00,660
- Three, two... - My heart was on fire.

3612
02:41:00,860 --> 02:41:03,259
- Switch. RHTokyo. - We killed it.

3613
02:41:03,260 --> 02:41:05,059
Let's go!

3614
02:41:05,060 --> 02:41:08,559
The moment the music started, I knew it was ours.

3615
02:41:08,560 --> 02:41:09,629
(100 percent excited)

3616
02:41:09,630 --> 02:41:12,200
- Let's go! - Let's go!

3617
02:41:13,440 --> 02:41:15,669
Asuka and Rico.

3618
02:41:15,670 --> 02:41:18,140
(Asuka and Rico Hirai of RHTokyo)

3619
02:41:21,280 --> 02:41:23,180
Let's show them the real krump.

3620
02:41:23,580 --> 02:41:24,779
(Let's go!)

3621
02:41:24,780 --> 02:41:26,549
(Tokyo power)

3622
02:41:26,550 --> 02:41:28,020
I did not expect that.

3623
02:41:30,750 --> 02:41:32,550
We were trying to win with sheer power.

3624
02:41:34,920 --> 02:41:36,860
I thought it'd be great to create a wow moment...

3625
02:41:38,560 --> 02:41:39,560
(Can't get over it)

3626
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:43,600
No, we didn't actually care.

3627
02:41:49,470 --> 02:41:51,509
I am great.

3628
02:41:51,510 --> 02:41:52,970
Good one, Asuka!

3629
02:41:53,380 --> 02:41:55,109
I will win this time.

3630
02:41:55,110 --> 02:41:56,280
Probably nothing.

3631
02:41:57,980 --> 02:41:59,779
Let's send our power straight to them.

3632
02:41:59,780 --> 02:42:01,250
I'm never intimidated.

3633
02:42:06,960 --> 02:42:08,090
I will show you.

3634
02:42:11,560 --> 02:42:13,500
Come on. Different.

3635
02:42:18,830 --> 02:42:20,270
I think they felt the pressure.

3636
02:42:20,400 --> 02:42:21,740
They didn't frighten me.

3637
02:42:23,940 --> 02:42:27,140
The countdown. Five, four, three...

3638
02:42:27,480 --> 02:42:29,609
I was determined to win.

3639
02:42:29,610 --> 02:42:31,710
Battle over.

3640
02:42:31,810 --> 02:42:34,719
I think our choreography had better quality.

3641
02:42:34,720 --> 02:42:37,090
Fingers crossed that we still win.

3642
02:42:39,990 --> 02:42:41,260
It's too close.

3643
02:42:41,590 --> 02:42:44,460
It's scary. I feel like I'll get hit.

3644
02:42:44,560 --> 02:42:45,560
The left side.

3645
02:42:47,200 --> 02:42:48,430
It's the left team this time.

3646
02:42:49,160 --> 02:42:50,270
It was a tough one.

3647
02:42:50,470 --> 02:42:53,600
They were super close.

3648
02:42:54,170 --> 02:42:57,240
I'm so happy. We killed it.

3649
02:42:58,240 --> 02:43:00,940
It was great. Very good.

3650
02:43:01,240 --> 02:43:02,240
You guys ate it.

3651
02:43:02,540 --> 02:43:04,309
That was so smart for them to be like,

3652
02:43:04,310 --> 02:43:06,280
"Oh, you two."

3653
02:43:06,550 --> 02:43:08,620
That was my favorite part.

3654
02:43:09,350 --> 02:43:12,319
You must be proud of her. You must be proud of them.

3655
02:43:12,320 --> 02:43:14,620
- She danced krump. - Krump? Right.

3656
02:43:16,020 --> 02:43:17,060
I thought we could win.

3657
02:43:17,890 --> 02:43:19,530
I want Kaea and I to win.

3658
02:43:19,760 --> 02:43:22,599
I loved AG SQUAD. The way you started the battle...

3659
02:43:22,600 --> 02:43:25,229
For me, when you first started, you looked a little bit confused.

3660
02:43:25,230 --> 02:43:27,239
And then the switch in the teammates.

3661
02:43:27,240 --> 02:43:29,200
I loved that concept, and you came with the energy.

3662
02:43:31,170 --> 02:43:34,680
On the other side, RHTokyo, you guys were amazing.

3663
02:43:35,140 --> 02:43:37,450
"Insanely good." Is that right?

3664
02:43:38,610 --> 02:43:39,949
Cute.

3665
02:43:39,950 --> 02:43:41,849
Because you lost the first round,

3666
02:43:41,850 --> 02:43:43,819
I could see you coming in with hunger.

3667
02:43:43,820 --> 02:43:45,750
For me, this was a really, really close battle.

3668
02:43:48,860 --> 02:43:50,089
I am clueless.

3669
02:43:50,090 --> 02:43:51,660
I am clueless too.

3670
02:43:51,760 --> 02:43:54,130
Their energy is so different.

3671
02:43:55,260 --> 02:43:59,270
It would be so embarrassing on our name, Pearce, to lose.

3672
02:43:59,600 --> 02:44:02,340
Gosh, I want to win.

3673
02:44:02,870 --> 02:44:04,610
Fight judges,

3674
02:44:04,910 --> 02:44:06,509
- Let's go. - Let's go.

3675
02:44:06,510 --> 02:44:07,680
Open your cards.

3676
02:44:09,680 --> 02:44:13,280
(AG SQUAD has 2 votes so far.)

3677
02:44:15,150 --> 02:44:17,889
(RHTokyo has 2 votes so far.)

3678
02:44:17,890 --> 02:44:20,660
- No way. - Mr. Feel.

3679
02:44:21,060 --> 02:44:23,229
- It's all up to you now. - Let's find out.

3680
02:44:23,230 --> 02:44:25,130
I'm counting on you.

3681
02:44:25,390 --> 02:44:26,430
Let's go.

3682
02:44:26,960 --> 02:44:28,000
We already know.

3683
02:44:28,860 --> 02:44:30,329
Mike Song!

3684
02:44:30,330 --> 02:44:31,330
Mike Song.

3685
02:44:31,530 --> 02:44:33,439
From what we've seen from you guys before...

3686
02:44:33,440 --> 02:44:36,339
It was so refreshing to see just another vibe.

3687
02:44:36,340 --> 02:44:38,069
And again, so much power.

3688
02:44:38,070 --> 02:44:39,070
AG SQUAD.

3689
02:44:39,071 --> 02:44:41,839
It's all presentation in a part of this version of the battle,

3690
02:44:41,840 --> 02:44:44,049
and it's really just about who's going to be the better showman.

3691
02:44:44,050 --> 02:44:45,880
So you guys also killed it.

3692
02:44:45,980 --> 02:44:48,320
My decision, I cannot say.

3693
02:44:49,150 --> 02:44:50,689
Open your card.

3694
02:44:50,690 --> 02:44:51,890
We will be okay.

3695
02:44:52,090 --> 02:44:54,160
Pray the next card will be purple.

3696
02:44:59,130 --> 02:45:03,329
(AG SQUAD wins Round 2, the duet battle.)

3697
02:45:03,330 --> 02:45:05,799
(AG SQUAD clinched the victory in this neck-and-neck battle.)

3698
02:45:05,800 --> 02:45:07,640
It's a 3 to 2 victory...

3699
02:45:08,370 --> 02:45:11,870
for Team Australia, AG SQUAD.

3700
02:45:11,970 --> 02:45:14,539
It's 2 to 0. This is the 3rd round.

3701
02:45:14,540 --> 02:45:16,880
And if we take this out, we could win.

3702
02:45:17,080 --> 02:45:19,410
(My heart just dropped.)

3703
02:45:21,680 --> 02:45:22,850
There's still one more.

3704
02:45:23,150 --> 02:45:24,590
This is the real start.

3705
02:45:25,020 --> 02:45:28,359
We lost in both rounds.

3706
02:45:28,360 --> 02:45:30,230
It's a bit risky if things stay like this.

3707
02:45:31,390 --> 02:45:35,000
I could feel the pressure building up.

3708
02:45:36,500 --> 02:45:38,270
They only have one more.

3709
02:45:38,500 --> 02:45:41,170
There are 3 rounds left, but they only have to win 1.

3710
02:45:41,770 --> 02:45:44,140
- Let's take it out. - Let's do it.

3711
02:45:44,270 --> 02:45:47,239
The energy started rising with RHTokyo, so we're good.

3712
02:45:47,240 --> 02:45:48,240
Let’s change the momentum.

3713
02:45:48,241 --> 02:45:50,349
We can do what we like.

3714
02:45:50,350 --> 02:45:51,350
Let’s change the momentum.

3715
02:45:51,710 --> 02:45:52,809
This is the real beginning.

3716
02:45:52,810 --> 02:45:54,680
The real game begins now.

3717
02:45:55,250 --> 02:45:57,349
Now, if AG SQUAD wins again...

3718
02:45:57,350 --> 02:45:59,850
in the upcoming Round Three,

3719
02:46:00,160 --> 02:46:03,460
RHTokyo will become the second crew to be eliminated...

3720
02:46:03,660 --> 02:46:05,160
and will have to leave the stage.

3721
02:46:05,490 --> 02:46:08,960
RHTokyo has no room left to retreat.

3722
02:46:09,060 --> 02:46:13,070
The moment they lose this round, elimination will become a reality.

3723
02:46:14,140 --> 02:46:17,009
Round Three, which could be the final showdown...

3724
02:46:17,010 --> 02:46:18,070
Ace battle?

3725
02:46:18,310 --> 02:46:19,910
You never know what’s going to happen in a 1-on-1 battle.

3726
02:46:21,880 --> 02:46:23,550
It will be a 1-on-1 battle.

3727
02:46:24,050 --> 02:46:26,480
- Let's go! - Let's go, girls.

3728
02:46:27,520 --> 02:46:28,749
(Nodding)

3729
02:46:28,750 --> 02:46:31,250
It's going to be Reina. It has to be Reina.

3730
02:46:31,320 --> 02:46:33,390
They have to win. Then it has to be Reina.

3731
02:46:33,490 --> 02:46:34,720
Let's go, Reina.

3732
02:46:35,720 --> 02:46:39,360
Whenever there's a battle, they rely on Reina.

3733
02:46:40,030 --> 02:46:42,429
Reina has a strong mindset.

3734
02:46:42,430 --> 02:46:44,930
Even with such a small frame, she doesn’t let it show on her face

3735
02:46:45,870 --> 02:46:48,400
I think she's an amazing battler.

3736
02:46:48,500 --> 02:46:49,500
She won't lose.

3737
02:46:50,470 --> 02:46:54,079
Today, Reina is the leader of RHTokyo.

3738
02:46:54,080 --> 02:46:55,539
Yes, Reina!

3739
02:46:55,540 --> 02:46:57,449
Thank you so much for the support.

3740
02:46:57,450 --> 02:46:58,450
Reina!

3741
02:46:59,050 --> 02:47:02,719
Rie entrusted me with the role of leader,

3742
02:47:02,720 --> 02:47:06,819
so I was determined to lead everyone,

3743
02:47:06,820 --> 02:47:10,090
and I knew I absolutely had to step up for the solo battle.

3744
02:47:10,630 --> 02:47:11,630
We will root for you.

3745
02:47:11,631 --> 02:47:14,359
I'll back you up, so Reina, no matter what you do, it's okay.

3746
02:47:14,360 --> 02:47:15,360
You are the best.

3747
02:47:15,960 --> 02:47:17,270
You are the best.

3748
02:47:17,800 --> 02:47:22,100
I knew I absolutely had to win the upcoming 1-on-1 battle.

3749
02:47:23,140 --> 02:47:24,639
Who is it going to be for AG SQUAD?

3750
02:47:24,640 --> 02:47:25,809
I think it's going to be Aaliyah.

3751
02:47:25,810 --> 02:47:27,509
- Aaliyah. - I think it's going to be Aaliyah.

3752
02:47:27,510 --> 02:47:28,809
It could also be Alysha.

3753
02:47:28,810 --> 02:47:31,079
If we take this out, we could win.

3754
02:47:31,080 --> 02:47:34,249
We really needed to strategize who to send in next.

3755
02:47:34,250 --> 02:47:36,479
We needed to be strong but different...

3756
02:47:36,480 --> 02:47:38,889
to what RHTokyo are doing.

3757
02:47:38,890 --> 02:47:42,319
We had Danica, we had Aaliyah, and we had Alysha...

3758
02:47:42,320 --> 02:47:43,959
prepared to do a solo.

3759
02:47:43,960 --> 02:47:47,259
So whatever the song was to come out, we need to just...

3760
02:47:47,260 --> 02:47:49,730
whoever was feeling it was to just go in.

3761
02:47:50,130 --> 02:47:52,129
- No pressure. - No pressure.

3762
02:47:52,130 --> 02:47:53,130
Hey.

3763
02:47:53,740 --> 02:47:56,240
We'll spin the bottle to decide who will go first.

3764
02:47:57,010 --> 02:47:58,210
Let's go.

3765
02:47:58,640 --> 02:48:01,040
- RHTokyo will go first. - Let's go!

3766
02:48:01,140 --> 02:48:03,079
- AG SQUAD will go second. - Let's go.

3767
02:48:03,080 --> 02:48:04,849
- Come on. - Let's go!

3768
02:48:04,850 --> 02:48:07,020
(The two crews who will not choose to back down fight.)

3769
02:48:07,180 --> 02:48:09,519
Do what you always do.

3770
02:48:09,520 --> 02:48:11,050
- RHTokyo. - RHTokyo.

3771
02:48:12,550 --> 02:48:13,820
They'll pull it off no matter what.

3772
02:48:14,120 --> 02:48:15,419
Go, girls.

3773
02:48:15,420 --> 02:48:17,959
No matter what songs they play, we're ready...

3774
02:48:17,960 --> 02:48:19,030
to just kill it.

3775
02:48:19,730 --> 02:48:20,900
You guys ready?

3776
02:48:21,800 --> 02:48:24,930
- Fight. - Let's go.

3777
02:48:26,030 --> 02:48:27,370
(Round 3, 1-on-1 battle, RHTokyo goes first.)

3778
02:48:27,570 --> 02:48:29,340
It's got to be Reina.

3779
02:48:30,370 --> 02:48:31,370
Reina's coming.

3780
02:48:31,570 --> 02:48:32,640
Reina.

3781
02:48:32,910 --> 02:48:34,909
(Oh, my gosh.)

3782
02:48:34,910 --> 02:48:36,440
(Bouncing)

3783
02:48:37,450 --> 02:48:40,080
I must win no matter what.

3784
02:48:40,350 --> 02:48:42,480
I feel confident to win.

3785
02:48:42,950 --> 02:48:44,319
(Let's show them.)

3786
02:48:44,320 --> 02:48:45,450
Reina.

3787
02:48:45,950 --> 02:48:47,320
- Reina. - Let's go.

3788
02:48:50,020 --> 02:48:52,060
- Let's go, Reina. - Reina.

3789
02:48:52,190 --> 02:48:53,190
Oh, my gosh.

3790
02:48:53,700 --> 02:48:54,700
(Exclaiming)

3791
02:48:54,701 --> 02:48:56,160
- Come on. - I thought it was cute.

3792
02:48:56,400 --> 02:49:00,200
- Reina. - I'll do everything I can.

3793
02:49:00,700 --> 02:49:01,700
Reina.

3794
02:49:03,710 --> 02:49:04,970
(Explosive cheers)

3795
02:49:05,340 --> 02:49:07,080
Reina.

3796
02:49:07,440 --> 02:49:08,580
(The audience couldn't be more immersed.)

3797
02:49:08,840 --> 02:49:10,780
(The excitement is through the roof.)

3798
02:49:11,280 --> 02:49:13,520
It was so heated up. I knew I won.

3799
02:49:13,750 --> 02:49:15,150
Watch me. I'll show you.

3800
02:49:16,750 --> 02:49:18,390
More.

3801
02:49:20,920 --> 02:49:23,160
See? External.

3802
02:49:23,390 --> 02:49:25,259
The Reina hidden inside is out.

3803
02:49:25,260 --> 02:49:28,830
Reina is probably under a lot of pressure.

3804
02:49:29,860 --> 02:49:33,229
I only felt confident to win, to be honest.

3805
02:49:33,230 --> 02:49:34,739
Go.

3806
02:49:34,740 --> 02:49:35,740
(The slogan attack)

3807
02:49:35,741 --> 02:49:38,309
Countdown. Five, four,

3808
02:49:38,310 --> 02:49:40,979
three, two, one.

3809
02:49:40,980 --> 02:49:42,609
Switch. AG SQUAD.

3810
02:49:42,610 --> 02:49:45,179
(Reina of RHTokyo's turn ends.)

3811
02:49:45,180 --> 02:49:46,510
(Cheering)

3812
02:49:46,610 --> 02:49:48,180
Reina pulled it off.

3813
02:49:48,880 --> 02:49:51,519
(Followed by the next 1-on-1 battler)

3814
02:49:51,520 --> 02:49:52,820
It's coming.

3815
02:49:52,990 --> 02:49:54,490
Who's it going to be?

3816
02:49:54,720 --> 02:49:56,360
It has to be Danica.

3817
02:49:56,660 --> 02:49:57,660
Let's go.

3818
02:49:58,660 --> 02:49:59,960
(I'll go.)

3819
02:50:00,230 --> 02:50:01,230
You got this.

3820
02:50:01,430 --> 02:50:04,029
Danica's like, "I'm going to take this solo."

3821
02:50:04,030 --> 02:50:06,100
She's confident. It's her time to shine.

3822
02:50:06,530 --> 02:50:07,539
Danica.

3823
02:50:07,540 --> 02:50:09,739
(Let's go, Danica on heels.)

3824
02:50:09,740 --> 02:50:11,170
(Standing up automatically)

3825
02:50:11,570 --> 02:50:12,570
Let's go, girl.

3826
02:50:12,571 --> 02:50:14,039
- I'm going to fight for it. - Let's go.

3827
02:50:14,040 --> 02:50:16,110
So I wanted to be a little more aggressive.

3828
02:50:16,380 --> 02:50:19,079
- Oh my gosh. - It's a completely different genre.

3829
02:50:19,080 --> 02:50:20,280
I'm kind of nervous.

3830
02:50:23,050 --> 02:50:24,089
(Continuous spin)

3831
02:50:24,090 --> 02:50:25,490
Her technique is crazy.

3832
02:50:29,160 --> 02:50:30,530
- She's super flexible. - She's so good.

3833
02:50:32,630 --> 02:50:34,829
I think I'm going to win this battle.

3834
02:50:34,830 --> 02:50:37,270
I am just confident in my ability.

3835
02:50:38,200 --> 02:50:39,200
Kill it.

3836
02:50:39,670 --> 02:50:40,739
Take it.

3837
02:50:40,740 --> 02:50:41,740
Bring it back.

3838
02:50:41,741 --> 02:50:43,340
(Keep going.)

3839
02:50:43,640 --> 02:50:45,010
(Provoking)

3840
02:50:45,370 --> 02:50:46,740
(Go away.)

3841
02:50:47,410 --> 02:50:49,140
She's so good right now.

3842
02:50:49,540 --> 02:50:50,550
She's darn good.

3843
02:50:51,080 --> 02:50:52,080
(You have to look at me.)

3844
02:50:52,750 --> 02:50:58,249
Countdown. Five, four, three, two, one.

3845
02:50:58,250 --> 02:51:00,460
Battle over.

3846
02:51:01,660 --> 02:51:03,660
(Elimination Battle Round 3 1-on-1 battle is over.)

3847
02:51:06,930 --> 02:51:09,630
(Deeply torn)

3848
02:51:09,730 --> 02:51:10,870
It's okay.

3849
02:51:11,270 --> 02:51:12,270
We won.

3850
02:51:13,070 --> 02:51:14,269
Nice, Niki.

3851
02:51:14,270 --> 02:51:16,469
Danica.

3852
02:51:16,470 --> 02:51:18,110
Oh, my gosh. My voice.

3853
02:51:18,670 --> 02:51:20,270
- They were both very good. - She's so flexible.

3854
02:51:20,480 --> 02:51:23,009
Reina focused on dancing,

3855
02:51:23,010 --> 02:51:25,009
- whereas she showed her technique. - Yes.

3856
02:51:25,010 --> 02:51:26,110
They're so different.

3857
02:51:27,150 --> 02:51:28,920
- They can't help but be nervous. - Of course.

3858
02:51:29,220 --> 02:51:31,389
- That will determine the result. - Right.

3859
02:51:31,390 --> 02:51:33,120
It could be their last round.

3860
02:51:33,920 --> 02:51:36,360
First, Fight Judge Park Jin Young.

3861
02:51:36,660 --> 02:51:39,030
What did you think of the 1-on-1 battle?

3862
02:51:40,760 --> 02:51:41,930
Reina...

3863
02:51:42,130 --> 02:51:43,360
(Focusing)

3864
02:51:43,770 --> 02:51:46,100
expressed with her whole body and soul...

3865
02:51:46,970 --> 02:51:49,640
that she will not go home just yet.

3866
02:51:50,940 --> 02:51:52,939
It felt as if she was screaming that.

3867
02:51:52,940 --> 02:51:54,810
"I will not go home."

3868
02:51:56,140 --> 02:51:58,579
(Cheering)

3869
02:51:58,580 --> 02:51:59,910
(Good job, my girl.)

3870
02:52:00,050 --> 02:52:01,980
(Overwhelmed)

3871
02:52:02,450 --> 02:52:05,889
I felt her strong determination...

3872
02:52:05,890 --> 02:52:07,960
to prevent her team from going home.

3873
02:52:08,920 --> 02:52:11,889
Fortunately, Danica wasn't affected by her.

3874
02:52:11,890 --> 02:52:14,259
She kept her composure...

3875
02:52:14,260 --> 02:52:16,159
and showed her style.

3876
02:52:16,160 --> 02:52:18,500
I was surprised by how calm she could be.

3877
02:52:19,200 --> 02:52:22,340
It was the match of strong versus soft.

3878
02:52:23,200 --> 02:52:26,039
That was a super dope battle.

3879
02:52:26,040 --> 02:52:28,179
One more time. Make some noise.

3880
02:52:28,180 --> 02:52:29,640
(Make some noise.)

3881
02:52:30,950 --> 02:52:31,950
(Thankful)

3882
02:52:32,280 --> 02:52:33,280
Thank you.

3883
02:52:33,580 --> 02:52:36,920
Danica, all of your movement in the heels, I think...

3884
02:52:37,150 --> 02:52:40,019
Of course, she did that crazy spin to the drop.

3885
02:52:40,020 --> 02:52:43,559
But I'm just talking about holding moments, like...

3886
02:52:43,560 --> 02:52:46,659
all of the strength and control it takes to manage that whilst...

3887
02:52:46,660 --> 02:52:49,460
still having a relationship with the music.

3888
02:52:49,630 --> 02:52:51,429
It's so incredible.

3889
02:52:51,430 --> 02:52:53,629
So, I definitely wanted to just applaud you for that.

3890
02:52:53,630 --> 02:52:54,640
Thank you so much.

3891
02:52:55,670 --> 02:52:57,000
(Agreed)

3892
02:52:57,170 --> 02:52:58,370
- Thank you. - Amazing.

3893
02:52:59,970 --> 02:53:03,010
I've been waiting for this moment.

3894
02:53:03,380 --> 02:53:05,010
The moment when Reina comes forward.

3895
02:53:05,510 --> 02:53:08,319
(Overwhelmed)

3896
02:53:08,320 --> 02:53:11,150
Because Reina is totally...

3897
02:53:11,820 --> 02:53:12,820
everything.

3898
02:53:13,020 --> 02:53:16,059
Choreography, battle, all the strength, and...

3899
02:53:16,060 --> 02:53:18,060
You showed all that in that moment.

3900
02:53:20,090 --> 02:53:21,759
I'm so happy to see this moment.

3901
02:53:21,760 --> 02:53:23,030
(Thank you.)

3902
02:53:24,070 --> 02:53:25,170
We'll see who wins.

3903
02:53:25,900 --> 02:53:28,439
- This is making me so nervous. - Oh, my gosh.

3904
02:53:28,440 --> 02:53:30,339
- I'm so nervous about this. - I know.

3905
02:53:30,340 --> 02:53:31,740
RHTokyo got this.

3906
02:53:32,140 --> 02:53:33,270
I think Reina won.

3907
02:53:33,670 --> 02:53:35,380
Who knows?

3908
02:53:36,240 --> 02:53:38,649
I hate to see either one of them go.

3909
02:53:38,650 --> 02:53:39,949
It's okay. We won't lose.

3910
02:53:39,950 --> 02:53:41,749
We won't lose here.

3911
02:53:41,750 --> 02:53:43,079
We'll have three wins from here.

3912
02:53:43,080 --> 02:53:46,420
RHTokyo won't lose here and go back.

3913
02:53:47,050 --> 02:53:50,259
I did everything I could.

3914
02:53:50,260 --> 02:53:51,790
I think I'll win.

3915
02:53:52,560 --> 02:53:53,630
You killed that.

3916
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:55,000
You killed it.

3917
02:53:55,160 --> 02:53:57,500
I do feel confident that we'll win this round.

3918
02:53:57,970 --> 02:54:01,470
Fight Judges, open your cards.

3919
02:54:08,780 --> 02:54:10,309
(RHTokyo takes the first win.)

3920
02:54:10,310 --> 02:54:11,650
Reina, thank you.

3921
02:54:12,880 --> 02:54:14,519
Reina.

3922
02:54:14,520 --> 02:54:16,619
She pulled it off.

3923
02:54:16,620 --> 02:54:21,589
I finally gave the crew a good flow.

3924
02:54:21,590 --> 02:54:23,260
I was happy.

3925
02:54:24,090 --> 02:54:26,059
- It's only the beginning. - It's only the beginning.

3926
02:54:26,060 --> 02:54:27,860
AG SQUAD...

3927
02:54:28,100 --> 02:54:31,229
lost their chance to win and end it all.

3928
02:54:31,230 --> 02:54:32,870
(AG SQUAD lost.)

3929
02:54:33,470 --> 02:54:36,969
In Round 3 1-on-1 battle that became intenser,

3930
02:54:36,970 --> 02:54:39,669
as RHTokyo takes one additional win,

3931
02:54:39,670 --> 02:54:43,110
the current score is 2 to 1.

3932
02:54:43,380 --> 02:54:45,179
If AG SQUAD who has two wins...

3933
02:54:45,180 --> 02:54:47,279
wins this round,

3934
02:54:47,280 --> 02:54:48,619
they're guaranteed to survive.

3935
02:54:48,620 --> 02:54:52,089
This may be a moment where we can get this win.

3936
02:54:52,090 --> 02:54:54,459
RHTokyo who only has one win...

3937
02:54:54,460 --> 02:54:57,589
must win this round...

3938
02:54:57,590 --> 02:55:00,059
for the one last chance.

3939
02:55:00,060 --> 02:55:03,229
I kept shouting, "You can do it" in my heart.

3940
02:55:03,230 --> 02:55:05,870
We're not going to lose here, so let's keep calm.

3941
02:55:05,970 --> 02:55:08,340
Round Four is...

3942
02:55:08,900 --> 02:55:11,440
a 2-on-2 Duet Battle.

3943
02:55:11,740 --> 02:55:13,469
(Expectant)

3944
02:55:13,470 --> 02:55:14,710
(Let's go, duo.)

3945
02:55:14,840 --> 02:55:17,139
Oh, my gosh. This is so much fun.

3946
02:55:17,140 --> 02:55:19,279
We'll decide who goes first by spinning the bottle.

3947
02:55:19,280 --> 02:55:20,580
(Which crew will get to go first?)

3948
02:55:21,450 --> 02:55:22,549
(Nervous)

3949
02:55:22,550 --> 02:55:24,620
(Curious)

3950
02:55:29,520 --> 02:55:31,689
AG SQUAD will go first.

3951
02:55:31,690 --> 02:55:32,690
Let's go.

3952
02:55:33,090 --> 02:55:34,799
RHTokyo will go second.

3953
02:55:34,800 --> 02:55:35,960
This is unavoidable.

3954
02:55:36,260 --> 02:55:38,269
It's important who battles...

3955
02:55:38,270 --> 02:55:40,100
- in RHTokyo. - That's important.

3956
02:55:40,700 --> 02:55:42,869
They can't help but send a good one.

3957
02:55:42,870 --> 02:55:44,009
They must win.

3958
02:55:44,010 --> 02:55:47,110
If Reina and Rico can do it...

3959
02:55:47,610 --> 02:55:50,809
(A rookie duo of Reina and Rico?)

3960
02:55:50,810 --> 02:55:52,409
- It's still for each other, girls. - Yes.

3961
02:55:52,410 --> 02:55:53,410
- Let's go. - We got it.

3962
02:55:53,880 --> 02:55:56,779
I think it'll be Aaliyah and somebody else.

3963
02:55:56,780 --> 02:56:00,919
The 2-on-2 Duet Battle for the crew's fate.

3964
02:56:00,920 --> 02:56:02,220
You guys ready?

3965
02:56:02,460 --> 02:56:04,189
(We are...)

3966
02:56:04,190 --> 02:56:05,760
(We are ready.)

3967
02:56:06,190 --> 02:56:07,190
Fight.

3968
02:56:07,191 --> 02:56:09,960
(Who will join Round 4 from AG SQUAD?)

3969
02:56:10,630 --> 02:56:11,630
Yes. You just got to...

3970
02:56:12,130 --> 02:56:13,499
I'm going to eat it.

3971
02:56:13,500 --> 02:56:14,500
That's your song.

3972
02:56:14,501 --> 02:56:16,340
(Aaliyah comes forward.)

3973
02:56:17,370 --> 02:56:19,240
Aaliyah!

3974
02:56:20,940 --> 02:56:23,740
I saw that coming. I wasn't surprised.

3975
02:56:25,150 --> 02:56:26,580
She dances easily.

3976
02:56:29,750 --> 02:56:32,250
- She's good. - I wasn't shaken.

3977
02:56:33,250 --> 02:56:34,520
(Vanessa and Aaliyah go first.)

3978
02:56:37,630 --> 02:56:39,430
(Thrilled)

3979
02:56:39,630 --> 02:56:40,630
Let's go.

3980
02:56:40,631 --> 02:56:42,999
Vanessa and I are going to be bringing a different essence...

3981
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,130
that they can't naturally bring.

3982
02:56:49,370 --> 02:56:51,210
Aaliyah's Afro is so cool.

3983
02:56:53,140 --> 02:56:54,640
Let's go.

3984
02:56:58,650 --> 02:57:01,950
RHTokyo. We will win today.

3985
02:57:02,480 --> 02:57:05,250
Don't just assume it.

3986
02:57:07,150 --> 02:57:09,420
In this competition, you got to go.

3987
02:57:09,560 --> 02:57:10,620
We don't need a fifth.

3988
02:57:13,130 --> 02:57:14,229
They're so good.

3989
02:57:14,230 --> 02:57:15,630
That's crazy. They're amazing.

3990
02:57:19,900 --> 02:57:21,539
(Provoking)

3991
02:57:21,540 --> 02:57:22,839
(One more time)

3992
02:57:22,840 --> 02:57:24,610
(Surprised)

3993
02:57:26,910 --> 02:57:29,809
Countdown. Five, four,

3994
02:57:29,810 --> 02:57:32,809
three, two, one.

3995
02:57:32,810 --> 02:57:34,519
Switch. RHTokyo.

3996
02:57:34,520 --> 02:57:37,249
I really do believe that we'll win.

3997
02:57:37,250 --> 02:57:38,849
Come on. Let's show you.

3998
02:57:38,850 --> 02:57:42,160
I redeemed myself in Round Three.

3999
02:57:43,320 --> 02:57:47,729
Rico and Reina were going to do a popping routine,

4000
02:57:47,730 --> 02:57:51,229
but the song wasn't fitting at all.

4001
02:57:51,230 --> 02:57:52,270
Ako!

4002
02:57:52,430 --> 02:57:53,899
Ako.

4003
02:57:53,900 --> 02:57:56,399
I thought that the two of us could dance...

4004
02:57:56,400 --> 02:57:57,809
in sync.

4005
02:57:57,810 --> 02:57:59,540
The two of them dance together often.

4006
02:57:59,710 --> 02:58:02,380
The two of them are Rie Hata's right and left hands.

4007
02:58:02,580 --> 02:58:03,940
Let's go!

4008
02:58:06,810 --> 02:58:07,880
(Come on, RHTokyo.)

4009
02:58:08,480 --> 02:58:12,219
Let's do our very best so that we can continue on...

4010
02:58:12,220 --> 02:58:14,260
with everyone's trust in us.

4011
02:58:14,320 --> 02:58:15,459
Ako!

4012
02:58:15,460 --> 02:58:16,790
I was a little bit nervous.

4013
02:58:16,820 --> 02:58:18,090
Ako is good.

4014
02:58:19,190 --> 02:58:21,329
Everyone is fighting with desperation.

4015
02:58:21,330 --> 02:58:22,660
We refuse to lose.

4016
02:58:25,130 --> 02:58:26,200
(That's it.)

4017
02:58:28,340 --> 02:58:30,369
They were very hot as well.

4018
02:58:30,370 --> 02:58:32,840
We can't lose here.

4019
02:58:34,210 --> 02:58:35,709
(Surprised)

4020
02:58:35,710 --> 02:58:36,980
There you go!

4021
02:58:37,580 --> 02:58:40,180
Let's win no matter what and move on to Round Five.

4022
02:58:43,280 --> 02:58:46,249
Counting down! Five, four,

4023
02:58:46,250 --> 02:58:49,559
three, two, one.

4024
02:58:49,560 --> 02:58:50,659
(An impactful ending)

4025
02:58:50,660 --> 02:58:52,160
(I love it!)

4026
02:58:54,830 --> 02:58:56,599
(Beat killing)

4027
02:58:56,600 --> 02:58:58,970
(Round 4, the duet battle, ends.)

4028
02:59:04,110 --> 02:59:05,140
It was incredible.

4029
02:59:06,110 --> 02:59:07,439
Nice.

4030
02:59:07,440 --> 02:59:08,909
Reina has solid skills.

4031
02:59:08,910 --> 02:59:10,210
Reina is really good.

4032
02:59:10,340 --> 02:59:13,049
So I feel like they're going to give it...

4033
02:59:13,050 --> 02:59:14,349
to RHTokyo.

4034
02:59:14,350 --> 02:59:15,350
Show us a win.

4035
02:59:15,351 --> 02:59:17,080
Why are you guys so good?

4036
02:59:17,250 --> 02:59:19,019
Seriously, Aaliyah...

4037
02:59:19,020 --> 02:59:20,690
- She's good. - She was born with it.

4038
02:59:20,820 --> 02:59:23,389
AG SQUAD has so many good dancers. It's incredible.

4039
02:59:23,390 --> 02:59:25,089
It'll be a bit hard to choose the winning crew.

4040
02:59:25,090 --> 02:59:26,630
But this is a battle.

4041
02:59:28,330 --> 02:59:29,929
Fight Judge Mike Song,

4042
02:59:29,930 --> 02:59:32,169
what did you think of the Duet Battle?

4043
02:59:32,170 --> 02:59:35,400
It was a very strong weapon versus a very strong weapon.

4044
02:59:35,540 --> 02:59:36,939
It was so hard to compare the two.

4045
02:59:36,940 --> 02:59:38,670
"A very strong weapon" is such a cute expression.

4046
02:59:39,240 --> 02:59:42,379
When Aaliyah and Vanessa came forward...

4047
02:59:42,380 --> 02:59:45,849
Also, the moments you guys created had so many different dynamics.

4048
02:59:45,850 --> 02:59:49,649
They were super raw. You guys had so much contrast.

4049
02:59:49,650 --> 02:59:52,090
I feel like that's you guys' superpower.

4050
02:59:52,420 --> 02:59:53,420
(Thank you.)

4051
02:59:53,421 --> 02:59:55,460
- Good, girls. - Good, girls.

4052
02:59:55,820 --> 02:59:57,260
Ako and Reina.

4053
02:59:57,990 --> 03:00:00,329
You guys are also such a powerful duo.

4054
03:00:00,330 --> 03:00:03,800
It's clear that you guys have danced together for a very long time.

4055
03:00:03,930 --> 03:00:08,339
I feel like there was balance like fire and water.

4056
03:00:08,340 --> 03:00:09,969
I feel like what you guys brought,

4057
03:00:09,970 --> 03:00:12,640
catching even that beat kill at the end...

4058
03:00:13,070 --> 03:00:14,140
Thank you.

4059
03:00:16,610 --> 03:00:19,379
AG SQUAD, I loved your approach of setting one person,

4060
03:00:19,380 --> 03:00:21,419
alternating, and coming together.

4061
03:00:21,420 --> 03:00:24,049
You guys really came with energy the entire time.

4062
03:00:24,050 --> 03:00:26,049
I really appreciated that.

4063
03:00:26,050 --> 03:00:28,489
But on the other side, I loved RHTokyo...

4064
03:00:28,490 --> 03:00:30,119
and the way you guys came in together as a unit.

4065
03:00:30,120 --> 03:00:32,359
And you guys stuck as a unit the entire time.

4066
03:00:32,360 --> 03:00:36,760
So this battle is very difficult for me to make a decision as well.

4067
03:00:37,130 --> 03:00:39,199
(Round 4, the duet battle, showed different charms.)

4068
03:00:39,200 --> 03:00:41,600
(What will be the result of Round 4 that will seal the teams' fate?)

4069
03:00:41,870 --> 03:00:45,010
Now, let's check the result of the battle.

4070
03:00:45,110 --> 03:00:46,570
RHTokyo will win this time.

4071
03:00:47,710 --> 03:00:50,879
I redeemed myself in Round Three.

4072
03:00:50,880 --> 03:00:53,249
We can't lose now.

4073
03:00:53,250 --> 03:00:55,219
Reina will pull through.

4074
03:00:55,220 --> 03:00:56,250
We won't lose.

4075
03:00:56,350 --> 03:00:57,920
You never know.

4076
03:00:58,620 --> 03:01:01,559
AG SQUAD was bringing different vibes...

4077
03:01:01,560 --> 03:01:03,619
every single round.

4078
03:01:03,620 --> 03:01:05,889
So, am I intimidated? No. Never.

4079
03:01:05,890 --> 03:01:08,629
And I feel like we can definitely take out RHTokyo.

4080
03:01:08,630 --> 03:01:09,660
I'm nervous.

4081
03:01:10,060 --> 03:01:11,100
Fight judges.

4082
03:01:12,270 --> 03:01:14,000
- What will it be? - Open...

4083
03:01:15,200 --> 03:01:16,200
your cards.

4084
03:01:18,470 --> 03:01:20,070
(Surprised)

4085
03:01:20,170 --> 03:01:21,210
They won.

4086
03:01:21,980 --> 03:01:23,740
But this is a battle.

4087
03:01:25,980 --> 03:01:28,880
Now, let's check the result of the battle.

4088
03:01:29,050 --> 03:01:31,590
Fight Judges Park Jin Young and Mike Song,

4089
03:01:32,450 --> 03:01:33,520
open...

4090
03:01:34,660 --> 03:01:35,660
your cards.

4091
03:01:35,661 --> 03:01:38,130
- I'm nervous. - I can't watch this.

4092
03:01:39,660 --> 03:01:41,100
(Oh, my.)

4093
03:01:41,660 --> 03:01:42,829
(Park Jin Young chose AG SQUAD, )

4094
03:01:42,830 --> 03:01:44,060
(and Mike Song chose RHTokyo.)

4095
03:01:44,500 --> 03:01:46,230
(This is nerve-racking.)

4096
03:01:46,730 --> 03:01:48,099
(Okay.)

4097
03:01:48,100 --> 03:01:50,769
It's 1 to 1.

4098
03:01:50,770 --> 03:01:52,839
We did our best on that dance floor.

4099
03:01:52,840 --> 03:01:54,779
Vanessa and I will get this win.

4100
03:01:54,780 --> 03:01:57,039
To be honest, I didn't know which crew would win...

4101
03:01:57,040 --> 03:01:58,879
until the very end.

4102
03:01:58,880 --> 03:02:00,810
My head was blank.

4103
03:02:00,850 --> 03:02:04,620
Let's check the cards of the remaining three fight judges.

4104
03:02:04,850 --> 03:02:05,850
Fight judges.

4105
03:02:06,790 --> 03:02:07,820
What will it be?

4106
03:02:09,590 --> 03:02:10,690
Open...

4107
03:02:11,790 --> 03:02:12,790
your cards.

4108
03:02:14,400 --> 03:02:16,229
Please.

4109
03:02:16,230 --> 03:02:19,270
RHTokyo won't get eliminated.

4110
03:02:19,400 --> 03:02:21,839
Let's stop this battle in the fourth round.

4111
03:02:21,840 --> 03:02:22,899
(Desperate)

4112
03:02:22,900 --> 03:02:24,670
Open your cards.

4113
03:02:24,840 --> 03:02:26,540
(Oh, my.)

4114
03:02:27,780 --> 03:02:28,810
(Covering her mouth)

4115
03:02:30,610 --> 03:02:32,309
With the final score of 4 to 1,

4116
03:02:32,310 --> 03:02:35,749
Team Australia, AG SQUAD, won.

4117
03:02:35,750 --> 03:02:39,189
(AG SQUAD will move on to the semifinal round.)

4118
03:02:39,190 --> 03:02:41,320
(RHTokyo got eliminated.)

4119
03:02:42,090 --> 03:02:44,289
(You guys worked hard.)

4120
03:02:44,290 --> 03:02:46,890
Oh, my gosh.

4121
03:02:48,260 --> 03:02:52,069
I also feel very sad because...

4122
03:02:52,070 --> 03:02:53,569
RHTokyo will go home.

4123
03:02:53,570 --> 03:02:55,040
I feel very sad.

4124
03:02:56,040 --> 03:02:58,270
You're the best. I'm happy that I got to meet you.

4125
03:02:59,040 --> 03:03:02,639
(RHTokyo becomes the second team to leave the fight zone.)

4126
03:03:02,640 --> 03:03:04,850
- They must be disappointed. - Of course.

4127
03:03:05,110 --> 03:03:07,480
- They tried so hard. - They couldn't do it with Rie Hata.

4128
03:03:08,620 --> 03:03:12,420
It was hard to accept the fact that we lost.

4129
03:03:13,090 --> 03:03:15,420
We weren't just determined to win.

4130
03:03:15,590 --> 03:03:21,260
(The crew members were desperate to hold out until the final round.)

4131
03:03:23,560 --> 03:03:25,030
We couldn't hold out.

4132
03:03:25,530 --> 03:03:28,500
I feel so bad for Rie Hata.

4133
03:03:30,170 --> 03:03:31,470
I feel so bad.

4134
03:03:33,840 --> 03:03:37,810
Guys, you guys are amazing!

4135
03:03:38,680 --> 03:03:40,009
I'm sorry.

4136
03:03:40,010 --> 03:03:41,549
Why are you sorry?

4137
03:03:41,550 --> 03:03:43,449
I should be sorry for being unable to fight with you guys.

4138
03:03:43,450 --> 03:03:44,750
(That isn't true.)

4139
03:03:45,420 --> 03:03:50,860
(All of them feel apologetic because they were so desperate.)

4140
03:03:51,790 --> 03:03:54,130
I think it's truly impressive that the crew pulled through...

4141
03:03:54,530 --> 03:03:58,270
without wavering today in the absence of the leader.

4142
03:03:59,430 --> 03:04:03,240
The perfect teamwork and best creativity...

4143
03:04:03,800 --> 03:04:06,610
you've shown us...

4144
03:04:07,880 --> 03:04:09,840
shined brightly.

4145
03:04:10,480 --> 03:04:12,579
The most important thing, truly,

4146
03:04:12,580 --> 03:04:14,779
is if you guys are proud of how you represented yourselves...

4147
03:04:14,780 --> 03:04:15,780
with the artistry.

4148
03:04:15,781 --> 03:04:18,789
I think you guys created incredible artistry.

4149
03:04:18,790 --> 03:04:21,019
You guys represented yourselves to the fullest. So,

4150
03:04:21,020 --> 03:04:22,860
much respect, always.

4151
03:04:24,690 --> 03:04:25,929
(Thank you for your hard work!)

4152
03:04:25,930 --> 03:04:30,460
I'm so disappointed right now...

4153
03:04:30,660 --> 03:04:33,330
that I don't know what to say.

4154
03:04:33,700 --> 03:04:36,270
But we did our best, right?

4155
03:04:37,070 --> 03:04:40,040
(They have no regrets because they did their best today.)

4156
03:04:41,280 --> 03:04:45,549
I always think that I have to lead the crew...

4157
03:04:45,550 --> 03:04:48,649
because I can't depend on other people very well.

4158
03:04:48,650 --> 03:04:50,950
Thanks to World of Street Woman Fighter,

4159
03:04:51,420 --> 03:04:55,659
I learned that it's important to believe in everyone...

4160
03:04:55,660 --> 03:04:58,990
and compete with the strength of all the crew members.

4161
03:04:59,690 --> 03:05:02,360
Let's continue to fight on together.

4162
03:05:02,960 --> 03:05:05,029
And seeing two crews from Japan...

4163
03:05:05,030 --> 03:05:08,769
was a true surprise because I didn't expect it at all.

4164
03:05:08,770 --> 03:05:13,010
At first, I thought, "This is the absolute worst."

4165
03:05:13,170 --> 03:05:15,539
But I really hope OSAKA Ojo Gang...

4166
03:05:15,540 --> 03:05:18,279
will continue to shine brightly...

4167
03:05:18,280 --> 03:05:20,980
as a representative of Japan.

4168
03:05:21,280 --> 03:05:24,219
Even after we leave World of Street Woman Fighter,

4169
03:05:24,220 --> 03:05:28,720
we'll remember each and every thing we learned here as we live.

4170
03:05:29,220 --> 03:05:31,559
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you for your hard work.

4171
03:05:31,560 --> 03:05:33,090
Thank you for your hard work.

4172
03:05:33,430 --> 03:05:34,659
- Let's say it loudly. - Okay.

4173
03:05:34,660 --> 03:05:36,729
One, two.

4174
03:05:36,730 --> 03:05:38,730
- Thank you. - Thank you.

4175
03:05:39,430 --> 03:05:42,070
(RHTokyo's powerful farewell on World of Street Woman Fighter)

4176
03:05:42,540 --> 03:05:44,470
(We thank everyone for crying and laughing with us!)

4177
03:05:44,770 --> 03:05:45,870
Thank you.

4178
03:05:46,540 --> 03:05:47,740
(We're thankful too!)

4179
03:05:47,980 --> 03:05:49,010
Thank you.

4180
03:05:50,680 --> 03:05:51,980
Congratulations.

4181
03:05:52,050 --> 03:05:54,850
It was just such an honor to be on the stage with you guys.

4182
03:05:57,620 --> 03:06:00,850
Seriously, all the dancers were amazing.

4183
03:06:01,220 --> 03:06:04,060
It was nice to dance with everyone.

4184
03:06:05,260 --> 03:06:07,259
I don't think there'll be another youthful moment...

4185
03:06:07,260 --> 03:06:09,659
like this in my life.

4186
03:06:09,660 --> 03:06:10,800
I have no regrets.

4187
03:06:10,930 --> 03:06:12,830
I love you.

4188
03:06:14,570 --> 03:06:18,139
(The crew that fought on with passion, RHTokyo, left.)

4189
03:06:18,140 --> 03:06:21,980
(The 4 crews that took on the weight of desperation will continue on.)

4190
03:06:22,180 --> 03:06:25,009
(Global Artist Performance Mission)

4191
03:06:25,010 --> 03:06:27,979
I'm looking for a one-of-a-kind, unique performance...

4192
03:06:27,980 --> 03:06:31,080
that sets the world on fire and makes a major impact.

4193
03:06:31,690 --> 03:06:33,989
This is the last step before the final round.

4194
03:06:33,990 --> 03:06:36,389
The global female artist, Saweetie's...

4195
03:06:36,390 --> 03:06:40,430
music, character, world views, and energy...

4196
03:06:40,830 --> 03:06:43,600
will be reinterpreted with each crew's colors.

4197
03:06:43,700 --> 03:06:47,770
Please vote for the crew with the most memorable performance.

4198
03:06:48,640 --> 03:06:52,169
The Global Artist Performance Mission will be conducted through...

4199
03:06:52,170 --> 03:06:54,010
World of Street Woman Fighter's official YouTube channel, The CHOOM.

4200
03:06:54,610 --> 03:06:58,880
Please vote for the Global Artist Performance Mission now.

4201
03:07:00,180 --> 03:07:03,050
(A key step toward making it to the final round)

4202
03:07:04,990 --> 03:07:07,819
(No matter what happens, I won't let my team give up.)

4203
03:07:07,820 --> 03:07:09,859
(This is our last chance to make it to the final.)

4204
03:07:09,860 --> 03:07:11,559
(We're just going to put everything we have.)

4205
03:07:11,560 --> 03:07:14,189
(We'll prove ourselves through our dance, not words.)

4206
03:07:14,190 --> 03:07:17,599
I will reveal the second mission of the semi-final round.

4207
03:07:17,600 --> 03:07:18,699
(There's another one?)

4208
03:07:18,700 --> 03:07:20,270
It's the Dance Film Mission.

4209
03:07:20,900 --> 03:07:22,199
(Two missions?)

4210
03:07:22,200 --> 03:07:23,699
(Under the theme of women and queen, )

4211
03:07:23,700 --> 03:07:26,069
(you will be creating a choreography for the main section.)

4212
03:07:26,070 --> 03:07:29,339
(The crew that ranks first in the Global Public Evaluation...)

4213
03:07:29,340 --> 03:07:31,140
(will be taking the main section.)

4214
03:07:31,240 --> 03:07:33,009
(Sighing)

4215
03:07:33,010 --> 03:07:35,080
(I'm a little nervous though, because...)

4216
03:07:35,720 --> 03:07:37,350
(AG SQUAD received a low score in the Global Public Evaluation.)

4217
03:07:37,450 --> 03:07:38,989
(Even though that was a massive hit to the gut)

4218
03:07:38,990 --> 03:07:42,119
(Coming last in the Mega Crew Mission)

4219
03:07:42,120 --> 03:07:43,519
(I still feel disheartened.)

4220
03:07:43,520 --> 03:07:45,359
(When it comes to public viewings, )

4221
03:07:45,360 --> 03:07:46,729
(it's never in our favor.)

4222
03:07:46,730 --> 03:07:48,699
(We have to do some research.)

4223
03:07:48,700 --> 03:07:50,599
(Let's pull ourselves together and do this.)

4224
03:07:50,600 --> 03:07:51,799
(There was RHTokyo, )

4225
03:07:51,800 --> 03:07:53,129
(who lost.)

4226
03:07:53,130 --> 03:07:54,130
(OSAKA Ojo Gang...)

4227
03:07:54,131 --> 03:07:56,739
(has really become the crew that represents Japan.)

4228
03:07:56,740 --> 03:07:58,009
(We came all the way here.)

4229
03:07:58,010 --> 03:07:59,970
(Our only goal now is to win.)

4230
03:08:01,440 --> 03:08:03,409
(Dance Film Mission)

4231
03:08:03,410 --> 03:08:05,979
(Of course, everyone here is talented.)

4232
03:08:05,980 --> 03:08:07,980
(Who can win over the public's hearts the most?)

4233
03:08:08,320 --> 03:08:09,779
(Strategically too)

4234
03:08:09,780 --> 03:08:11,790
(She'll bring them views. Kyoka.)

4235
03:08:11,890 --> 03:08:14,859
(Obviously, she's amazing and strong, )

4236
03:08:14,860 --> 03:08:16,559
(but she makes the other dancers...)

4237
03:08:16,560 --> 03:08:17,659
(not look good.)

4238
03:08:17,660 --> 03:08:20,159
(Honestly, Kyoka could have just stood there...)

4239
03:08:20,160 --> 03:08:22,129
(and the rest of OSAKA Ojo Gang could have left.)

4240
03:08:22,130 --> 03:08:23,959
(It feels like dancers who have trained over a long period...)

4241
03:08:23,960 --> 03:08:26,099
(are making K-pop choreography for the first time.)

4242
03:08:26,100 --> 03:08:27,100
(But they still did well.)

4243
03:08:27,101 --> 03:08:29,599
(They should have done this for the actual K-pop mission.)

4244
03:08:29,600 --> 03:08:31,439
(I can tell they put in the effort, so it's cute.)

4245
03:08:31,440 --> 03:08:34,409
(But our crew has embodied the theme "women" most intuitively.)

4246
03:08:34,410 --> 03:08:36,439
(Since we placed first in the Mega Crew Mission, )

4247
03:08:36,440 --> 03:08:39,379
(the expectations for us have probably skyrocketed.)

4248
03:08:39,380 --> 03:08:41,110
(We really have to push ourselves and go all in.)

4249
03:08:42,920 --> 03:08:44,519
(Is your foot okay?)

4250
03:08:44,520 --> 03:08:46,589
(Which part was confusing for you?)

4251
03:08:46,590 --> 03:08:48,619
(Not like this. You have to do it in one move.)

4252
03:08:48,620 --> 03:08:50,519
(What?)

4253
03:08:50,520 --> 03:08:52,359
(Which camera am I looking at?)

4254
03:08:52,360 --> 03:08:54,489
(To be honest, no matter how hard I try, )

4255
03:08:54,490 --> 03:08:56,699
(I couldn't the overcome the natural limitations of my body.)

4256
03:08:56,700 --> 03:08:57,700
(I just gave birth...)

4257
03:08:57,701 --> 03:08:58,769
(about 70 days ago.)

4258
03:08:58,770 --> 03:09:00,729
(I didn't want to cause any trouble for my team, )

4259
03:09:00,730 --> 03:09:01,740
(so I was trying my best.)

4260
03:09:03,070 --> 03:09:05,269
(In the semi-final Dance Film Mission, )

4261
03:09:05,270 --> 03:09:08,479
(which crew will end up taking the main section?)

4262
03:09:08,480 --> 03:09:10,009
(Guys, we have to hold hands.)

4263
03:09:10,010 --> 03:09:11,949
(The tables have turned.)

4264
03:09:11,950 --> 03:09:12,950
(If we go by this momentum, )

4265
03:09:12,950 --> 03:09:13,950
(we'll be first place for view counts.)

4266
03:09:13,951 --> 03:09:15,519
(Please)

4267
03:09:15,520 --> 03:09:17,249
(But you never know with likes.)

4268
03:09:17,250 --> 03:09:19,349
(This main section should be ours.)

4269
03:09:19,350 --> 03:09:20,450
(No more losing.)

4270
03:09:20,790 --> 03:09:22,119
(Please)

4271
03:09:22,120 --> 03:09:23,759
(We worked really hard on this.)

4272
03:09:23,760 --> 03:09:25,329
(The final scores...)

4273
03:09:25,330 --> 03:09:26,330
(will now be revealed.)

4274
03:09:29,260 --> 03:09:30,260
(Unbelievable)
