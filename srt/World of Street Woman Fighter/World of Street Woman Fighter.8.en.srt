1
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,040
No. I nearly got the splits.

2
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,340
I started dancing when I was two, so I've done ballet, jazz,

3
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,179
all the dance a kid can do.

4
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,009
When I was really little,

5
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,849
I was always dancing around the house,

6
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,380
and I had really good rhythm.

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,720
I was like a dancing baby.

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,619
At school, I would always dance at lunchtime.

9
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,819
Yes. I would love to move to music.

10
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,319
(AG SQUAD, Kaleece)

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,429
When I was younger, especially, I loved breaking.

12
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,430
(MOTIV, Logistx)

13
00:00:57,431 --> 00:00:59,229
And it's not easy...

14
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:03,500
because breaking is a super powerful style.

15
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,769
But dance was one of the only things...

16
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,140
that helped get me through difficult moments.

17
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,740
Dance has changed my life.

18
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,279
I really loved dancing so much...

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,979
that there was nothing in my life but dance.

20
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,179
(OSAKA Ojo Gang, Kyoka)

21
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,990
I've worked harder than anyone else, so I'm confident in what I do.

22
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,890
In Osaka culture,

23
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,119
there is this thing called, "Super Kids."

24
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,330
Child dancers underwent training during a set period.

25
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,499
(Osaka Ojo Gang, Ibuki and Kyoka)

26
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,360
And I ran into Kyoka every time.

27
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,999
The first time we met, our rivalry was real.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,970
But as we grew,

29
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,839
we've become comrades.

30
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,139
We weren't always active in the same scene.

31
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,879
But I think we share a connection in that...

32
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,600
we're top dancers and professional dancers.

33
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,919
It is very rare to be able to share a dance journey with your sister.

34
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,549
We've been dancing with each other since we were little.

35
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,019
I think she was 7 or 8...

36
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,259
when she 1st started dancing. I was 12.

37
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,260
(Ruthy Baby)

38
00:01:58,261 --> 00:02:00,560
We spent years and years training.

39
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,030
I became the leader of Bubblegum Dance Crew at the age of 11.

40
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,799
When I was the leader, I got me and my crew the gold medal...

41
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,370
at the World Hip Hop Championships.

42
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:14,110
It feels like a pleasure. It is so amazing.

43
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,069
- Bubblegum! - Bubblegum!

44
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,209
We met Kyra in 2011.

45
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,479
Me, Kaea, and Kyra just stuck like glue.

46
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,979
(AG SQUAD, Kyra and Kaea)

47
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,619
We've done a lot of music videos and a lot of live performances.

48
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,049
I've been taking them to World Hip Hop Championship.

49
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,559
All of our knowledge and experiences can really...

50
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,589
bring together AG SQUAD and push us to hopefully win.

51
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,529
I'm also someone who's been dancing for quite a long time.

52
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,630
In terms of experience and maturity...

53
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:44,240
I don't think I fall behind anyone.

54
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,039
I do feel confident in us.

55
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,239
I feel like we can win the show.

56
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,979
I've gained a lot of love and support internationally,

57
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,439
which has been crazy.

58
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,409
(I feel good.)

59
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,919
Our fans support us with a mentality stronger than ours.

60
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,949
We love you guys so much. Thank you.

61
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,590
Thank you.

62
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,589
We're so lucky.

65

who love and support us no matter what.

(Why is MOTIV surprised?)

67
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,070
Gosh, look at this.

68
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,969
This is crazy. I've never experienced this before.

69
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,570
This is too much, guys.

70
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,370
Gosh.

71
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,879
That's really sweet.

72
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,010
That's going to make me cry.

73
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,979
"We are the MOTIV's people."

74
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,819
Gosh, you made us cry.

75
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,020
Thank you.

76
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,619
It's this overwhelming amount of love.

77
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,890
I don't have the words to describe my gratitude.

78
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,899
(AG SQUAD saw the coffee truck sent by their fans.)

79
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,700
That's pretty cool. Can I take a video?

80
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,369
I've never ever...

81
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,769
had a customized coffee truck for us.

82
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,239
That is crazy.

83
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,010
- We love you, AG ANGELS. - We love you, AG ANGELS.

84
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,709
What a dream. What a dream come true.

85
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,049
Who would've thought? You know?

86
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,020
Our faces on a coffee truck.

87
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,019

00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,390
- Thank you. - Thank you.

89
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,789
The support from our AG ANGELS pushes us...

90
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,429
to want to win and to want to do our best.

91
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,799
Please stay with us.

92
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,030
We'll make sure we win for you guys.

93
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,169
Thank you for your support.

94
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,600
AG ANGELS, I love you.

95
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,869
- Thank you. - Thank you.

96
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,310
We love you Motivators.

97
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,040
We're going to win for the fans.

98
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,479
World of Street Woman Fighter is powered by...

99
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,220
product sponsorship and partnership with a leading K-culture brand.

(Tonight)

00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,519
(Elimination Battle)

102
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,549
To determine the crews that will make it to the finals,

103
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,889
the final Elimination Battle will begin.

104
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,259
Since we're in the semifinals,

105
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,689
everyone here has the skills.

106
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,129
I want us to move on to the final round, no matter what.

107
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,359
By any means...

108
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,999
(We have to win, no matter what.)

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,329
(We cannot end up in the Elimination Battle again.)

110
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,900
I feel confident that we can knock out any team.

111
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:04,479
(The performance that may bring this long journey to an end)

112
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,809
I don't want this to be the end for us.

113
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,349
We do not want to go home. We will be at final.

114
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,909
This is really hard to judge.

115
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,319
This is going to go the whole way.

116
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,079
We can't be eliminated this time.

117
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,489
This is driving me insane.

118
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,049
(With the final round just around the corner, )

119
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,630
(which crew will be the last one to leave the fight zone?)

120
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,060
(The last step before they reach the finals)

121
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,089
(The first mission is the Global Artist Performance Mission.)

122
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,400
(AG SQUAD was chosen by the global artist, Saweetie.)

123
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,329
AG SQUAD earned 100 bonus points.

124
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,969
We're definitely making our way to the top.

125
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,899
(Dance Film Mission)

126
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,769
Each crew will be assigned to a section...

127
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,580
to create one full dance film together.

128
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,479
(The best dance crew of the Dance Film Mission...)

129
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,679
(will be chosen through the Fight Judges Evaluation.)

130
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,279
(The best dance crew will be given 100 bonus points.)

131
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,319
(But the winner of the main section...)

132
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,789
(will be chosen through the Global Public Evaluation.)

133
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,919
By combining the scores of...

134
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,419
(Global Artist Performance Mission)

135
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,459
(Dance Film Mission)

136
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,559
With the two missions, the score of each crew will be determined.

137
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,800
This main section should be ours.

138
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,969
(Make it look wild.)

139
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,969
The red-haired one never disappoints.

140
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:36,999
(It should be us.)

141
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,439
Probably a lot of people were expecting more from BUMSUP.

142
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,040
What kind of performance would feel new and refreshing?

143
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,939
Very different from what they normally do.

144
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,849
I feel like we just took who we were and elevated it.

145
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,850
(Shocked)
(That's crazy.)

146
00:06:51,851 --> 00:06:53,479
The song suits Kyoka.

147
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,619
(Leave it to me!)

148
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,790
We're totally ready.

149
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,260
We're at ease too.

150
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,060
(The main section will, of course, be ours.)

151
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,930
I think we'll definitely win this.

152
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,329
This is a critical moment.

153
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,299
Based on the Global Public Evaluation,

154
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,229
the crew that will be taking the main section is...

155
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,929
We fell short this time, and...

156
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,099
(I don't get it.)

157
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,940
(Which crew will be taking the main section of the Dance Film Mission?)

158
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,280
(Main section filming day)

159
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,549
Okay, yes. Dance.

160
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,850
(All 4 crews have arrived at the studio.)

161
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,650
Back to the intensity, back to the fighting.

162
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,819
"Back to the fighting."

163
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,589
Yes, I feel like this is important...

164
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,089
because it's going to put us in a spot where...

165
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,430
we have the advantage moving forward.

166
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,859
(Waacking again?)

167
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,929
This time, as you can see,

168
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,129
OSAKA Ojo Gang...

169
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,730
is giving hip-hop.

170
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,639
(Forget waacking. OSAKA Ojo Gang is now a hip-hop gang.)

171
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,869
When we got this mission,

172
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,680
we had an idea of who will shine.

173
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,710
I think it's Kyoka's turn this time.

174
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,950
(Shining Kyoka)

175
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,420
Thank you.

176
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,690
It's because... Did you listen to the song?

177
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,549
(It's totally hip-hop, which is Kyoka's secret weapon.)

178
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,919
Last time, we lost with hip-hop.

179
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,059
So this time, we'll win through someone else's strength.

180
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,059
(They pulled out their hip-hop cheat code, Kyoka, to win.)

181
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,660
We'll use the real deal to win.

182
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,899
(What is BUMSUP's secret weapon?)

183
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,040
I'm Aiki, not no: ze. Don't lose track of me.

184
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,569
I'm Aiki, not no: ze.

185
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,369
Can you make sure it says "Aiki" on the screen?

186
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,910
(The real no: ze looks confused.)

187
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,650
What do you think of our bangs?

188
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,109
(Do we look good?)

189
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,120
(Suddenly feeling embarrassed)

190
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,019
I feel like you get into costume...

191
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,449
- for every semifinal mission. - Right.

192
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,560
- It's a separate mission for me. - With long hair.

193
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,629
So ultimately, we have to become the best dance crew.

194
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,729
Right.

195
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,330
- That's our goal. - Right.

196
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,100
We can't get complacent. Even if we win the Mega Crew Mission,

197
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,800
we can actually get eliminated. No one knows.

198
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,669
So this mission is called "Woman, Queen."

199
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,479
I hope that everyone sees how strong females are...

200
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,279
in our main section choreography routine.

201
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,349
We need to get to the finals.

202
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,289
Let's win this main section...

203
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,419
because we have what it takes to win.

204
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,359
We keep it fresh every single time, and if we make it to finals,

205
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,759
we will bring it even more.

206
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,460
Something new you've never seen before.

207
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,859
- That rhymes. - That rhymes.

208
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,999
- It rhymes? - Come on now.

209
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,129
Yes.

210
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,599
Let's crush it!

211
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,500
(Let's crush it!)

212
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,710
- AG SQUAD, out! Let's get it! - Yes.

213
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,940
Please stand by.

214
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,430
The rest of us are not in the frame for this section.

215
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,610
I'm the only one who's in the shot here.

216
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,320
Can you center Kyoka more in the frame?

217
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,150
Please center Kyoka more in the frame.

218
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,319
When we got this mission...

219
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,860
I think it's Kyoka's turn this time.

220
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,090
You can count on me!

221
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,429
Among my crew members, I thought I was the best fit for this song.

222
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:59,099
Since the Mega Crew Mission, we felt that focusing on someone...

223
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,269
made it easier to coordinate and work together.

224
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:05,709
So practicing like that made things flow very smoothly.

225
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,279
I think a queen is someone who influences a lot of people.

226
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,149
Someone universally recognized for her real achievements.

227
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:16,250
Kyoka, herself, is already a respected queen,

228
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,860
so we created a work that truly captured Kyoka's essence.

229
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,690
It's okay for the movements to be small. Execute with precision.

230
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,800
Junna, the center is this way.

231
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,929
There is pressure in that...

232
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,670
I have to show who I am while leading the performance.

233
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,439
Today it truly hit me that every single crew member...

234
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,070
relies on me.

235
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,039
(Minami got injured from the repeated knee movements.)

236
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,110
I'm completely fine.

237
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,179
Thank you.

238
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,180
(First aid complete)

239
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,790
(OSAKA Ojo Gang rehearsed passionately until the end.)

240
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:54,029
I think OSAKA Ojo Gang suits this concept the most.

241
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,560
So the main section will of course be ours.

242
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,060
(Smirking)

243
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,959
AG SQUAD in the house.

244
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,300
Yes, the bottom's lit.

245
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,899
So cute.

246
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,369
Come get your chairs.

247
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,540
This is nice. Okay, center.

248
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,040
We could use a prop, maybe.

249
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,640
Or even use a chair.

250
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,880
To start it off maybe, so it's like,

251
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,179
- "Boom!" - Yes, we haven't done a chair,

252
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,019
and I don't think any other crew has done a chair before,

253
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,220
- No. - so that will be great.

254
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,219
Ruthy Baby had the idea of starting on a chair...

255
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,490
and wearing hats.

256
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,889
Make it look wild.

257
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:26,919
- Energy. - Just maybe...

258
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,629
Don't go like that.

259
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,999
You get lit, hot, boom.

260
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,629
- Just don't... - All out.

261
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,630
Full up.
Keep it tight.

262
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,700
I think now, you use your mouths more.

263
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:42,769
Our concept is to just showcase how strong all of our women...

264
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,540
and AG SQUAD girls are.

265
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,379
There is no definition of queen.

266
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,779
There are different types of queens.

267
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,149
Gangster queens, feminine queens.

268
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:55,019
What queen means to us is "everyone,"

269
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,219
"every style," and "every type of female."

270
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,290
That is queen to AG SQUAD.

271
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,429
Hey.

272
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,960
We have a lot of...

273
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,229
And this part, and the group might...

274
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,669
- Can you head center? - Go to the center.

275
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,670
Center.

276
00:12:10,671 --> 00:12:13,370
This mission is for our music video.

277
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,669
For my career, I have featured in a lot of music videos,

278
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,780
so I know what looks good on camera.

279
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,850
We're going to kill it.

280
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,950
The other teams should be scared.

281
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,950
Scared, I tell you.

282
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,019
I think it will be better if we don't overdo it.

283
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,360
Let's just do what we do...

284
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,829
Giving off a vibe of subtle sexiness.

285
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,190
Subtle sexiness...

286
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,299
and wild movements to show energy.

287
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,180
A performance that swings between hot and cold.

288
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,030
When I heard the song, I vibed with it.

289
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,539
The style I like and the style Honey J likes...

290
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,169
are quite similar,

291
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,939
so people have told us that it feels like my and Honey J's...

292
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,609
old Purplow performances.

293
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,850
So I really worked hard on the flow.

294
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,750
Five, six, eight.

295
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,149
Look straight ahead.

296
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,050
Why are your feet so sluggish?

297
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,419
(Writhing in despair)

298
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,520
What am I going to do?

299
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,320
More energy! Nice!

300
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,959
Okay!

301
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,159
(Endless repetition)

302
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,400
She nailed the technique in just three days.

303
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
(Bruises of glory)

304
00:13:15,501 --> 00:13:18,200
Ri.hey is experienced enough, so she can avoid getting bruises,

305
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,839
but I'm bruised like this all over.

306
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,040
Everyone's like that at first.

307
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,670
(They're now rehearsing for the last scene.)

308
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,710
(What is the towel that Ri.hey throws?)

309
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,549
It says "Doubt."

310
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,279
So we're using it to express, "Let's not doubt ourselves."

311
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,879
Go. Walk away.

312
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,550
Real women don't doubt themselves.

313
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,259
- That's why I don't doubt my looks. - Okay.

314
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,619
- Thank you for your hard work. - Today, I will definitely...

315
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,789
- Thank you for your hard work. - show off my beauty.

316
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,300
You better watch out, no: ze.

317
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,400
Why do you always pick on me?

318
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,030
She's always messing with me.

319
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,199
Instead of doing the ending fairy, we'll use the towel to...

320
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,239
We don't have ending fairy.

321
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,969
- What? - We don't have ending fairy.

322
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,980
But MOTIV's been practicing for the ending fairy, though.

323
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,650
We don't have ending fairy this time.

324
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,410
I'm still going to hold it.

325
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,979
We're just going to stay there...

326
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,220
- Yes, we should get our redemption. - until they close.

327
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,919
I'm feeling ready to show people a different side of MOTIV...

328
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,889
rather than just grooving.

329
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:17,389
I'm ready to perform, I'm ready to serve face.

330
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,859
Kaidi, maybe you're like,

331
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,730
"Show me that you really..."

332
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,870
(Adding more expressiveness)

333
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,170
(Nodding)

334
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:27,269
I would say, just more engagement if you're ever in the center.

335
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,009
You could also try something different every time.

336
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,010
- Can I? - Yes.

337
00:14:30,011 --> 00:14:31,040
Okay, I'll do that.

338
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,479
I'm trying to think of my transition.

339
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,480
Right.

340
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:36,379
(Logistx tries out a new technique.)

341
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,780
Even that's fire.

342
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,180
We never did that here.

343
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,019
I think I really want to prove to people watching...

344
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,360
that we are capable of so much more.

345
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,429
It definitely had a nice mixture of...

346
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,499
feminine and masculine, so I wanted to...

347
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,899
make sure that we embodied those styles.

348
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,069
We've got a suit and tie feel.

349
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,799
These tight leather pants.

350
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,569
It was all about balance...

351
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,240
within the movement and within the clothing.

352
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:03,770
You look cool.

353
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,409
- We look cool. - We look cool.

354
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,609
Yes.

355
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,179
- I'm watching right now. - You look cool.

356
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,450
(What kind of performance will MOTIV put on?)

357
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,590
- MOTIV's about to go. - Gosh.

358
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,619
It's MOTIV.

359
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,059
This song is very hip-hop.

360
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,230
If MOTIV does a great job,

361
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,400
they will suit this song well.

362
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,500
They feel like hip-hop princesses.

363
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,929
Because they're very hip-hop based girls.

364
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:30,970
MOTIV.

365
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,500
They're wearing ties.

366
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,869
I think we all might have come up with similar things.

367
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,940
I didn't expect that.

368
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,310
(What kind of performance did MOTIV prepare?)

369
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,380
- What? That's unexpected. - They look like skirts.

370
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,320
They went with this image for "Woman, Queen."

371
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,720
- Hey. Okay. - I like this.

372
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,100
(Thrilled)

373
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,100
They've become very K-pop.

374
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,200
- I love this. - I love that.

375
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,470
They feel more like K-pop.

376
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,010
It's so different from their usual style.

377
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,679
Simple but effective.

378
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,980
Come on, MOTIV!

379
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,150
Come on, Kaidi.

380
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,729
So different.

381
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,860
They're trying to be feminine.

382
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,630
Bella did a flip.

383
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,030
That's cool.

384
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,700
- Let's go. - Come on.

385
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,300
Logistx is coming through, as always.

386
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,799
That was brief.

387
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,370
It felt a bit flat.

388
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,640
That was creative.

389
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,320
Cool. It was cool.

390
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,420
Gosh.

391
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,160
I'm so touched that MOTIV's style became so girly.

392
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,089
- Right. - Their style changed quite a lot.

393
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,699
- I know. - It felt like students who have...

394
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,846
trained for a long time created their first K-pop choreography.

395
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,930
Like a project done by top students.

396
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,490
They should have done that for the World of K-pop Mission.

397
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,840
- Good job. - Good job.

398
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,610
Makeup and our fashion. I feel like we just took...

399
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,550
who we were and elevated it in a way that...

400
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,919
we haven't done before in the competition.

401
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,320
So I feel like the other competitors are going to recognize that.

402
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,429
It was very different to what they normally do.

403
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,629
The beginning was super different to what they do.

404
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,359
That was such a K-pop routine.

405
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,369
- Yes. - Yes.

406
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,530
- Let's go, K-pop! - Let's go, K-pop!

407
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,939
They showcased that...

408
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,610
there's no definition of a queen. Like there are...

409
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,940
cuts of queens, and they showcased that.

410
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,310
- Yes. - Yes.

411
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,410
It was good.

412
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,810
I think ours is still more impactful.

413
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,420
I see.

414
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
I see.

415
00:18:00,281 --> 00:18:03,220
I thought this was the perfect song for MOTIV to showcase their skills.

416
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,520
I wanted to see MOTIV's authentic hip-hop...

417
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,460
with this song.

418
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,500
It wasn't traditional hip-hop.

419
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,800
So this was something totally new for them.

420
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,599
But that style is everywhere.

421
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,999
You're right.

422
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,540
That's similar to ROYAL FAMILY's or AG SQUAD's dance styles.

423
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,509
It has that formulaic feel.

424
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,649
It just really had that vibe.

425
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,810
The outfits too.

426
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,280
They wore ties and jackets over them.

427
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,320
That kind of overlapped with AG SQUAD.

428
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,420
- Yes. - Yes.

429
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:39,690
Their usual style would have really matched this song well.

430
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,129
The way they interpreted "Woman, Queen..."

431
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:45,260
was similar to ROYAL FAMILY's style.

432
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,330
Such a shame.

433
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,000
Such a shame, MOTIV.

434
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,170
Right.

435
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,040
Hello.

436
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,279
How is it?

437
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,640
It's fine. The floor's fine.

438
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,550
Point the camera at me, please.

439
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,210
BUMSUP!

440
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,950
Probably a lot of people were expecting more from...

441
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,050
BUMSUP.

442
00:19:08,051 --> 00:19:11,360
People really loved our performance in the previous mission.

443
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:15,790
I thought we shouldn't disappoint them...

444
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,259
by not meeting their expectations.

445
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,929
I'm a bit worried. But...

446
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,870
as always, we did our best in preparing.

447
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,939
Let's do this properly.

448
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,940
Okay.

449
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:30,469
Aiki and I will start from the center.

450
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,679
- Okay. - Like this. Then,

451
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,510
we can do what we practiced.

452
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:39,079
They're wearing chaps. They're cool with chaps.

453
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,919
They're going to do a girly vibe.

454
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,849
Maybe they might surprise us.

455
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,249
Where's Aiki?

456
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,760
Does she have a wig on?

457
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,760
Monika is in there.

458
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,189
Her baby is like seven weeks old.

459
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,560
Period.

460
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,299
(BUM)

461
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,700
I like the boots, though.

462
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,630
I love the blue gloves.

463
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:58,900
(Exclaiming)

464
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,199
- I'm so curious. - Yes.

465
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,770
Music, start.

466
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,610
(What will BUMSUP's main section stage look like?)

467
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,750
I like that.

468
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
That's cute.

469
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,420
I like the hair flip.

470
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,889
- Leejung. - It's cool.

471
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,160
It's cute.

472
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,530
Leejung performs well.

473
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,560
Goodness.

474
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,230
Right.

475
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,400
It's Aiki in the front, right?

476
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,640
Nice.

477
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,600
Aiki!

478
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,139
She's got hair!

479
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,669
I like the little shimmy.

480
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,280
(The surprising Aiki moment)

481
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,680
(Yes!)

482
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,649
Woman, queen!

483
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,750
That's Honey J.

484
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,379
That's hot.

485
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,119
(Exclaiming)

486
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,049
- That's so good. - Sexy.

487
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,519
That part is cool.

488
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,460
Honestly, I love how they do that.

489
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,659
That's lit.

490
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,699
It's cool.

491
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,470
- I love the floor part. - That's cool.

492
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,100
- They rolled into it. - Yes.

493
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,779
They did it like the motorbike.

494
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,979
It was good.

495
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,749
- It was cute. - That was nice.

496
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,950
I like that.

497
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,190
- Well done. - Thank you.

498
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,590
- Well done. - Well done.

499
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,489
Ri.hey throws the towel at the end,

500
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,559
and it's satisfying.

501
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,069
"We'll boldly and confidently pioneer our own way forward."

502
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,369
"We are the queens and women who go our way."

503
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,909
That's what I'd like you to think.

504
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,009
I feel like BUMSUP...

505
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,069
It was cool.

506
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:47,880
They kind of went into the more tomboy pocket.

507
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,480
And sexy as well.

508
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,220
And sexy. It was good.

509
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,819
I do like how they listened to the motorbike sound at the end.

510
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,620
(You can hear the motorbike sound with Ri.hey's last move.)

511
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,990
I didn't even hear it. It was smart.

512
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,360
I feel like, honestly,

513
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:09,769
that was the most comprehensive...

514
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:13,469
That was the most digestible...

515
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:17,069
and clear, patient...

516
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,479
Without doing the absolute most.

517
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,050
Yes. I personally really enjoyed watching it.

518
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,819
I'm impressed. I like it.

519
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,820
Go, BUMSUP.

520
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,589
It was a bit flat. Just flat.

521
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,989
There was no exciting moment.

522
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,619
Yes. There was no exciting moment.

523
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,460
Like the only exciting part for me, personally, was that floor part.

524
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,630
I only liked the intro.

525
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,600
That was a bit cool.

526
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,569
- I think if you think of it... - I don't know.

527
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:49,609
As the main section, it's not as...

528
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,709
Yes. It doesn't scream...

529
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,110
- main section. - Yes.

530
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,609
But like seeing the last mission they did...

531
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,250
and then seeing this one,

532
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,120
I guess I am recognizing that they're leveling up.

533
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,459
I think their synergy as a group is starting to make more sense.

534
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,489
- Yes. - Yes.

535
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,989
- That's... - More time with each other.

536
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,829
I think it's this space making them dance more together.

537
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,859
- Yes. - That...

538
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:16,130
And now, I see it, and I get why it's them now.

539
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,429
It's cool to watch them grow.

540
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:20,539
"What should we present to look new?"

541
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,469
"How can we make it so you don't get bored?"

542
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:28,009
We're trying out so many new things.

543
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,580
I hope you know that.

544
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,650
Please. We want to go to the final round.

545
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,719
- Chairs. - AG SQUAD.

546
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,119
- AG SQUAD. - AG SQUAD.

547
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,889
I'm really excited to see AG SQUAD's stage.

548
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,389
They have great teamwork,

549
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,599
and at the same time, they're very commercial.

550
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,930
I think they'll nail the stage this time as well.

551
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,729
- Chairs. - Chairs.

552
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,200
And they have ties.

553
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,740
Yes. I was like, "Copycats."

554
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:55,970
Show us.

555
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,279
I was most conscious about AG SQUAD.

556
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,010
They always make flawless work.

557
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,009
Let's just walk it through.

558
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,149
(They're prepared.)

559
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,250
Us AG SQUAD girls are ready.

560
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,889
We're here to win.

561
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,150
That's what we're going to do.

562
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,089
Let's get it, girls!

563
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,760
- Let's go! - Let's go.

564
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,960
(What will AG SQUAD's main section stage look like?)

565
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,170
(Focusing)

566
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,399
(In sync)

567
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,410
Great.

568
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:30,969
Period.

569
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,180
I like that.

570
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,050
Period.

571
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,450
Okay.

572
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,820
Right.

573
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,019
- Okay. - They made a line.

574
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,220
The line!

575
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,060
They made it simple.

576
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,619
Ruthy Baby.

577
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,989
That's a little unclear.

578
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,060
A bit messy.

579
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,199
(She's impressed)

580
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,170
They're really powerful.

581
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,670
They're doing a lot.

582
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,880
Yes.

583
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,710
That's cool.

584
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,280
Period.

585
00:25:09,281 --> 00:25:10,650
They're really good.

586
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,819
But for this part,

587
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,150
I think ours is better.

588
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,520
They capture every sound.

589
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,589
- Neat. - Girl.

590
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,759
It's very neat.

591
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,760
I like that.

592
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,370
It's like AG SQUAD.

593
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,000
I knew they'd go with this feeling.

594
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,470
That's neat.

595
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,809
That's cool.

596
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:41,880
They have great teamwork.

597
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,220
Okay. They put their hat right back on.

598
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,220
The girl with red hair...

599
00:25:47,221 --> 00:25:48,619
- Never disappoints. - She's cool.

600
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,550
- Seriously. - She's cool.

601
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,519
(AG SQUAD's main section filming is done.)

602
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,059
Well done.

603
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,589
- Thank you! - Thank you.

604
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,090
Thank you.

605
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,859
Thank you.

606
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,599
- Thank you. - We did it.

607
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,869
AG SQUAD has killed it...

608
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,600
as per usual.

609
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,469
It was somewhat different from what we've seen so far.

610
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,809
Right.

611
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,239
It was very detailed.

612
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,779
- Right. - More detailed than their usual.

613
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,379
They removed some of the repetitiveness of polyswagg.

614
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,780
- Right. I guess that's why. - They kept changing it.

615
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,420
Repetitiveness.

616
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,919
I think they wanted to add more routine.

617
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,190
There were fewer catchy moves.

618
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,159
I feel like I had to focus to watch.

619
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,699
- Yes. - Yes. They crammed in a lot.

620
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,299
It felt rushed, though.

621
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,029
Rather than letting them be impactful.

622
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,399
And queens don't rush.

623
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,099
- Yes. - Queens don't rush.

624
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,039
The chairs only being used in the beginning...

625
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,109
and then not being used at all after...

626
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:47,479
- Yes. - is potential missed opportunity.

627
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,749
I wished that they had utilized their chairs more.

628
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:55,190
So I thought the chairs were kind of a fall there.

629
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,450
- It's just like AG SQUAD. - It was like AG SQUAD.

630
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:00,319
Woman and queen by AG SQUAD.

631
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,929
ROYAL FAMILY itself...

632
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,789
is already like woman and queen.

633
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,459
That's their style.

634
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,180
It feels like they've stayed within what they've already been doing.

635
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,939
It's just what I imagined.

636
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,299
It was the usual powerful...

637
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,410
and high-quality performance with great teamwork.

638
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:22,349
- Hello. - Hello.

639
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,910
We can start filming now.

640
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,519
Quick.

641
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,920
Let's hurry.

642
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,620
Ojo.

643
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,689
I hope they highlight the rest of the girls.

644
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,490
I feel like they... It's always just...

645
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,159
- Ibuki. - Ibuki.

646
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,900
So I hope she's highlighted all the girls.

647
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,559
Because the song suits Kyoka.

648
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,369
(I agree.)

649
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,700
Kyoka, did you...

650
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,469
- Kyoka? - Kyoka?

651
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,800
- Are you here? - Is that you?

652
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,769
It would be interesting to see their interpretation...

653
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,640
of "Woman, Queen."

654
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,609
(They're curious.)

655
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:56,980
Soon to see.

656
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,250
What do you think...

657
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,319
a queen is?

658
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,890
What kind of person is a queen?

659
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,620
That was set as our theme this time.

660
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:09,630
I led the crew with this.

661
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,100
Their outfits are cute.

662
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,230
I expected their outfits to be more full out.

663
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,539
I wore headphones...

664
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,509
to express the other members...

665
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,670
as notes of the music I'm listening to.

666
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,680
We're expressing the music.

667
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,180
We're prepared.

668
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,980
We're relaxed this time.

669
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:35,649
We wanted to show an image that screams Ojo Gang...

670
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,790
within one second.

671
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:43,230
(What will the Dance Film main section of Ojo Gang look like?)

672
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,299
(Kyoka appears.)

673
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,300
Nice.

674
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,900
Finally.

675
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,370
Kyoka is back.

676
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,440
Nice.

677
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,010
Go, Kyoka.

678
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,479
Kyoka vibe.

679
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,480
A different vibe.

680
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,649
They lined up diagonally.

681
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,420
Minami.

682
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,020
(Amazed)

683
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,020
Nice.

684
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,390
Gosh.

685
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,560
- Nice. - We have the best dancer.

686
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,770
- She's lit. - From here on, it's fire.

687
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,740
She really has great power.

688
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,410
That's so cool.

689
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,210
There you go.

690
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,380
Nice.

691
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,850
This part is nice.

692
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:41,120
- Yes, girl. - She's so good.

693
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,290
See? From here on out, it's nice.

694
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,790
Yes, girl.

695
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,589
- That was cool. - Right.

696
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,930
You're a queen.

697
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,630
Cool.

698
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,300
That's cool.

699
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,600
This is good.

700
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,600
It's definitely a cool concept.

701
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,170
This is so lit.

702
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,840
I like the ending.

703
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,140
Nice!

704
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,780
It was good!

705
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,550
That's so cool.

706
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,849
I'm glad Kyoka was in the middle.

707
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,190
- Yes. - Yes.

708
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,559
I feel like Ibuki really took on our...

709
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,559
feedback we gave for the Mega Crew Mission.

710
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,759
Most definitely.

711
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,959
That's exactly what we told them to do.

712
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,800
I was thinking of the headphones toward the end.

713
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,230
Because of the sound of the headphones.

714
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:32,270
- Smart. - It's just the beginning part.

715
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,439
- That's so cool. - She wears it.

716
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,840
When she wears it, they disappear.

717
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,340
Muting.

718
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,279
I think they expressed the sound waves.

719
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,279
I think they did.

720
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,009
One person is at the center.

721
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,550
I think they're different in that way.

722
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:51,319
- It's not as impactful. - Yes.

723
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,419
Kyoka is dynamic in her movements,

724
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,690
but no one is matching her range,

725
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,189
so it just doesn't...

726
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,430
look unified.

727
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,130
They didn't really use the stage a lot.

728
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,669
- Yes. - Like use the area.

729
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,540
They just kind of stuck to the middle.

730
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,370
- Messy. - Yes, messy. You're right.

731
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,580
You can't see what's happening.

732
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,610
It is always so messy.

733
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,910
Too loose.

734
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:19,620
Obviously, she's amazing and strong, but it also...

735
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,489
She makes the other dancers not look good.

736
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:23,490
Yes.

737
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:27,220
Her backup dancers. She looks like Beyonce and the rest are...

738
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:30,029
Maybe they're saying she's the queen...

739
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,290
because she's the highlight.

740
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:34,130
They don't look like a team. They look like...

741
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,299
This time, our teamwork was perfect.

742
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,670
It was just perfect.

743
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,240
I will take it.

744
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,680
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's filming is done too.)

745
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,109
- Thank you. - Thank you.

746
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,149
Thank you.

747
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,319
(The 4 crews have filmed the main section.)

748
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,320
(And...)

749
00:31:54,321 --> 00:31:57,250
(the Global Public Evaluation on the main section begins.)

750
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:00,119
They approached something they don't normally do,

751
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,589
which is being more feminine.

752
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:04,229
You sometimes need to try something new.

753
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,499
("I got goosebumps so many times! MOTIV is surely a strong group.")

754
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,800
And MOTIV did that so well this time.

755
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,270
Their moves were so strong but still feminine.

756
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,239
("AG SQUAD's group dance quality is just on another level.")

757
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,509
How can each member's star quality shine so much...

758
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,710
within such detailed and well-designed choreography?

759
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,139
BUMSUP were very BUMSUP.

760
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,679
("The clean, restrained moves remind you of Purplow's girls' hip-hop.")

761
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,949
They stuck to what they do best,

762
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:29,289
and they're very simple moves that work for them and look cool.

763
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:31,350
Kyoka was just Kyoka.

764
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:32,889
("Kyoka is so cool. She makes you realize you are beautiful...")

765
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:33,959
("as you are and are capable of anything.")

766
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,730
She doesn't say she's this kind of woman.

767
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:38,460
She just shows her personal brand. That's energy.

768
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,950
(What would be the result of the Global Public Evaluation?)

769
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,840
(The day the main section results are announced)

770
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,040
(The semi-final battle begins.)

771
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:00,480
(Time to decide who will take the main section choreography.)

772
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,790
(The main section crew will be decided through the result.)

773
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,259
(Which crew did the global public choose for the main section?)

774
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,489
Hi, everyone.

775
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,529
(Time to announce the main section crew)

776
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,699
This is intense.

777
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,560
I feel very scared right now.

778
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,300
- This is intense. - What's this?

779
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,870
Numb to the feeling of pressure.

780
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:22,670
(The 4 crews of the semi-final are all here.)

781
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:25,010
Semi-final Dance Film Mission.

782
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,310
The fight for the main section has ended.

783
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:32,349
The crew that gets the main section for this Dance Film Mission...

784
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,870
will be decided by the results of the Global Public Evaluation.

785
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,820
Which crew will take the main section...

786
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,990
as a result of the Global Public Evaluation?

787
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,560
We'll reveal the final views of each crew.

788
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,360
(It makes them nervous.)

789
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,699
My armpits are sweating.

790
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,700
- This is intense. - I know.

791
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,800
That's the weakest in public vote.

792
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,640
Just be more hopeful.

793
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,149
Good work, girls.

794
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,356
(Public Evaluation Views: 1,507,967)

795
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,580
It should be us.

796
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,879
- That's high. - That's high.

797
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,190
- One million is now the standard. - It's the standard.

798
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,460
- Ours was quite high. - It's 2,439,599.

799
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,459
Goodness.

800
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,676
(There's a difference of about 1,000,000.)

801
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,100
We have to be chosen,

802
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:25,200
and I think we have a chance.

803
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,309
(They're shocked.)

804
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,570
(Glancing)

805
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,409
Goodness.

806

807

(Public Evaluation Views: 996,826)

808
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,780
No.

809
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,520
I feel angry, I don't feel sad. I feel frustrated.

810
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,420
Okay.

811
00:34:41,421 --> 00:34:43,590
(Sobbing)

812
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,219
Goodness.

813
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,220
(Feeling bitter)

814
00:34:46,221 --> 00:34:48,889
- Yes. Let's go. - Come on.

815
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:51,430
(What's OSAKA Ojo Gang's final number of views?)

816
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,699
(That's right.)

817
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,270
(It was very high!)

818
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,200
Yes.

819
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,410
The top crew in Global Public Evaluation Views...

820
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,240
is OSAKA Ojo Gang.

821
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,679
I am confident...

822
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,000
because I think we enjoyed while dancing for this mission.

823
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,320
- We got more views than MOTIV. - We did.

824
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,979
But still we're in the bottom two.

825
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,520
We should be at least first.

826
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,319
BUMSUP had the second most views.

827
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,360
Their views are 2,439,599.

828
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:29,899
The views of the 3rd crew are 1,507,967,

829
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,970
and that's AG SQUAD.

830
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,200
(Feeling dizzy)

831
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,509
The crew with the fewest views is MOTIV.

832
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:42,210
Their views are 996,826.

833
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,850
- That's crazy. - That's like...

834
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,379
It's declining.

835
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,390
I don't know how serious I should take this.

836
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:52,659
The difference in views between BUMSUP, who took second place,

837
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,959
and OSAKA Ojo Gang, who took first place,

838
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,190
is about 150,000.

839
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,900
Will the number of likes change the final rankings?

840
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,370
Yes. BUMSUP and OSAKA Ojo Gang's views were really close.

841
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,840
The final winner after adding up the likes.

842
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,739
We had more views than we thought,

843
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,770
so I was hopeful.

844
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,540
This is a critical moment.

845
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,879
BUMSUP and Ojo Gang have a high...

846
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,449
We still don't know the likes.

847
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:22,120
So I'm praying that the likes will bump us up.

848
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,560
But that can change. So I'm excited.

849
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,689
I've always valued having a winning mindset.

850
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,500
So I thought we could definitely win.

851
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:34,959
I'm really hoping.

852
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,269
(Which crew will get to smile to the number of likes?)

853
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,770
It's important from now on.

854
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,740
(Please.)

855
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:42,410
More likes.

856
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,740
It will be revealed now.

857
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,009
(Did the rankings stay the same?)

858
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,050

It's our 1st time winning 1st place.

866

It's the first time.

867
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,939
- Somebody other than BUMSUP... - Yes.

868
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,210
I know they're annoyed.

869

(Silent)

870
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,079
I feel a sense of crisis.

871
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,379
I think I can say I'm disappointed.

872
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,819
In the Dance Film Mission, the main section...

873
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,480
goes to OSAKA Ojo Gang.

874
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,149
(They're satisfied.)

875
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,860
- We did it. - We did it.

876
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,989
It feels really nice.

877
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:40,060
Many things happened, but we made it to this point...

878
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,699
(The results weren't good in the previous missions.)

879
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,300
The crew to take part in the first elimination battle...

880
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:53,039
(They were on the verge of elimination.)

881
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,010
(They had to hang on to the edge of the cliff.)

882
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,909
We didn't get good results...

883
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,149
in this season.

884
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,320
But we didn't give up...

885
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,319
and continued to do our best while trusting each other.

886
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,260
I think the viewers would have seen that.

887
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,559
(That makes taking the 1st place in the main section...)

888
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,429
(choreography battle more meaningful.)

889
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,529
- They deserve it. They did well. - That's their score.

892

00:38:40,021 --> 00:38:42,460
The bridge or the ending.

901
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,230
Isn't the opening better?

902
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,720
They might forget the ending.

903
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,530
Let's first listen to it.

904
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,800
I have no clue what the song is.

905
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,269
We get the slow part.

906
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,299
(AG SQUAD, 3rd place in Global Public Evaluation)

907
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,339
No. We can give it to MOTIV.

908
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,400
We get the second pick.

909
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,340
We give them the last section.

910
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,680
We get left with whatever...

911
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,909
Scraps.

912
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:04,180
I mean, their vibes are so different.

913
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,880
We might get a section that works.

914
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,650
Each sub section is designed with a distinct mood and concept,

915
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:14,390
allowing each crew’s unique style to stand out even more clearly.

916
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:17,090
- I'm curious. - There are concepts.

917
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:19,530
- Make no reactions. - Make no reactions.

918
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,200
Right. Now we're fighting to get the points.

919
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,270
Don't be like this. They might take it.

920
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:26,800
- Yes. - Nice.

921
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,369
Now, I'll reveal the music and concept...

922
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,610
for the first sub section.

923
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,980
What? RUINED QUEENS.

924
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:40,580
- RUINED QUEENS? - RUINED QUEENS?

925
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,450
The word "ruined" is killing me.

926
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,989
(RUINED QUEENS is revealed.)

927
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,060
- It would go well with AG SQUAD. - This is nice.

928
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:49,989
(Sub section 1 set concept: Ruined ancient architecture)

929
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,590
I want this part.

930
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:52,899
Quiet.

931
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,020
(Stopping her from reacting)

932
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,030
They're going to take it.

933
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,029
Yes.

934
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,770
- This is nice. - It's slow anyway.

935
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:04,010
It's too slow.

936
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,670
But let's act like we like it.

937
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,779
It's pretty good.

938
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,109
(They're allowed to fake the excitement.)

939
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,179
(They're totally immersed.)

940
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,420
All of a sudden, we're going...

941
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,649
This is nice. I like this concept.

942
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:16,449
(BUMSUP positively reacts to sub section 1, RUINED QUEENS.)

943
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:19,360
- I like it. - Totally.

944
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,310
AG SQUAD would also do well with this.

945
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,890
- They'd really do well. - I agree.

946
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:27,260
They would think that we would want that one, but it's too slow.

947
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,369
- I like that one. - Yes.

948
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:30,630
I want that one.

949
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:33,369
Next, I'll reveal the music and concept...

950
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,400
for the second sub section.

951
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,710
- I'm curious. - Right.

952
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,340
- Right. Come on out. - Give it to us.

953
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:41,940
Give it to us.

954
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:44,510
WEST COAST.

955
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,679
Nice.

956
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,556
(A section capturing the mood of West Coast hip-hop culture)

957
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,120
This is totally American.

958
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,919
- This... - This is so nice.

959
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,459
I think MOTIV should take this.

960
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,460
(This is totally ours.)

961
00:40:54,461 --> 00:40:55,520
We don't like it.

962
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,829
(Glancing)

963
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,460
I think this is the one we wanted.

964
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:01,330
It was very hip-hop oriented.

965
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,000
It has to be us.

966
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:07,769
(Surprised)

967
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,570
They're already into it.

968
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,869
MOTIV would make it look good.

969
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:12,909
- This section captures... - Right.

970
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:16,009
I think it's about whether or not...

971
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,010
- we go with the obvious. - Right.

972
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:20,619
Either way, we get to choose first.

973
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,620
Yes.

974
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,549
Our direction would matter.

975
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,859
We should choose something that would work well with us.

976
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,659
But I prefer 1 over 2.

977
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,859
- It's somehow better. - I think we'd resonate more...

978
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,730
- with the first one. - Right.

979
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,929
Even the theme, the picture, and the song are giving US vibes.

980
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:39,740
I'm Australian.

981
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,939
(Laughing)

982
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,510
We were avoiding that because that's just not our...

983
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:45,980
flavor.

984
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:49,549
Lastly, I'll reveal the music and concept...

985
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,610
for the third sub section.

986
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,019
This is the mood.

987
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,149
This is dope.

988
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,190
It's Jersey.

989
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,890
It's fast. Nice.

990
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,859
(They like the concept!)

991
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,359
We might get that. It is Jersey club.

992
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,360
Period. Jersey club it is.

993
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,429
We could make it work...

994
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,799
because it's Jersey club style.

995
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,870
But a lot is going on in that track...

996
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:18,069
that I don't want any part of.

997
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,280
But it's a bit difficult.

998
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,840
I think we'd have to be very busy.

999
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,150
I'm a queen.

1000
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,120
(Screaming)

1001
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:35,520
(Jersey club ends with a scream.)

1002
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:38,360
(The ending part leaves a strong impression.)

1003
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:41,700
All the three sub sections were revealed.

1004
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:46,500
You may decide which sub section you want to take.

1005
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:48,439
If they take RUINED QUEENS,

1006
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,170
- we take JERSEY CLUB, right? - Yes.

1007
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:51,769
And if they take JERSEY CLUB,

1008
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:53,740
- then we take RUINED QUEENS? - Yes.

1009
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,209
I feel like that's the most creative as well.

1010
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:57,449
- Yes. - We could make a bigger impact.

1011
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,519
That is the art.

1012
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,179
We can do body shades.

1013
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,719
- Yes. - We can do all three.

1014
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,119
- We can do all three. - Yes.

1015
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,760
That's why I'm not stressed.

1016
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,720
- We can do all 3. - We can do all 3.

1017
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:12,560
If I were BUMSUP, I would pick the first one...

1018
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:16,370
because I feel like AG SQUAD will want that one the most.

1019
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:17,630
So I would take it.

1020
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:21,269
I feel like if BUMSUP chooses RUINED QUEENS...

1021
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:22,909
I think AG SQUAD will take WEST COAST.

1022
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:24,069
- WEST COAST. - I agree.

1023
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:26,210
No. I feel like AG SQUAD is going to take...

1024
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:29,009
JERSEY CLUB. I don't know why.

1025
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:32,050
There is no point in deliberating. We just get...

1026
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,620
We get what they give us.

1027
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,090
(Sobbing)

1028
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:39,459
Strategically, we should consider how it would be...

1029
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,290
- if the other crew did it. - Yes.

1030
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:44,130
If you consider the music, the last section...

1031
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:46,800
has a lot going on and seems difficult.

1032
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,499
When you look at the visuals,

1033
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,700
- sub section one looks nice. - Right.

1034
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:53,170
But...

1035
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:57,610
If they take the last section,

1036
00:43:58,170 --> 00:43:59,380
they'd really do it well.

1037
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:02,139
I personally want to avoid the third one.

1038
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:05,180
Neon could end up looking very tacky.

1039
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:07,249
Since it's black and white,

1040
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:12,389
I think that could serve as an element...

1041
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:14,820
that could make it different from the other teams.

1042
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:18,829
I think we'll be cramming in the moves for the third one.

1043
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:21,260
I think the first one is a bit boring.

1044
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:24,570
No matter who makes the choreography,

1045
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:26,199
I think it would be a re-edit of our choreography so far.

1046
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,880
I don't think the choreography's concept would change dramatically.

1047
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,440
Let's vote by raising hands.

1048
00:44:30,441 --> 00:44:31,839
(They decide by raising hands.)

1049
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,840
(Which section will BUMSUP choose?)

1050
00:44:32,841 --> 00:44:34,909
Let's do it.

1051
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:35,940
It's okay. Let's do it.

1052
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:39,210
The semi-final round, Dance Film Mission.

1053
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,426
The crew in second place in the Global Public Evaluation...

1054
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:44,089
for the main section battle,

1055
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:47,190
BUMSUP, will choose the sub section first.

1056
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:50,059
The section that BUMSUP chose...

1057
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,329
(They're all...)

1058
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:53,259
(concentrating.)

1059
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:55,000
is the first section.

1060
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,430
(They all clap.)

1061
00:44:57,830 --> 00:44:59,599
(Yes.)

1062
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,770
We had trouble deciding between the 1st and the 3rd.

1063
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:08,079
But we thought the first section had a concept and music...

1064
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,450
our members could work better with.

1065
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,580
That's why we chose the first section.

1066
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:15,749
I think the music for the first section...

1067
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:18,120
is what we have always worked well with.

1068
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,589
- Say thank you. We want three. - Thank you.

1069
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:21,660
Nice and quick.

1070
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:25,560
Next, the crew in third place in the main section battle,

1071
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,960
AG SQUAD, will choose their section.

1072
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,300
So, we would love to have sub section three.

1073
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:36,170
This was actually our first choice. We wanted to have Neon Switch.

1074
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,670
So thank you.

1075
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:39,910
They wanted to have this.

1076
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:41,010
Yes.

1077
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:42,910
I knew they would want this.

1078
00:45:42,911 --> 00:45:45,010
I think they'll be great.

1079
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,780
I knew they would take it.

1080
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:51,120
I think concepts 1 and 2 have a set.

1081
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,519
But sub mission three...

1082
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,359
We can just reinvent ourselves again...

1083
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,660
and do something different.

1084
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,260
Save the best for last.

1085
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:05,469
(Well done, AG SQUAD.)

1086
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:06,470
Great!

1087
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,070
Not WEST COAST.

1088
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:09,400
- Not WEST COAST. - Right.

1089
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:13,439
I'm actually really happy that we got this section.

1090
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,609
This is what we wanted,

1091
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:16,450
so this worked out in our favor.

1092
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:22,519
I'm excited to represent Los Angeles!

1093
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,490
(They're very excited.)

1094
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:29,930
Now you are competing for the best dance crew...

1095
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:33,730
in one dance film video.

1096
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,500
In order to survive in this competition,

1097
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:40,570
it's crucial to leave a strong impression.

1098
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,370
So now,

1099
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:45,440
you will be given another chance.

1100
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:47,110
What chance?

1101
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,680
It is a chance, right?

1102
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,180
It's the hidden section.

1103
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,320
Goodness.

1104
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:56,750
Hidden section?

1105
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,449
(Sighing)

1106
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:00,520
I was very surprised.

1107
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:03,790
So we're not too sure what we're going to do to that.

1108
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:06,629
And at this point, the show has so many surprises...

1109
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:09,300
that it doesn't even matter what happens because...

1110
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:11,170
I know we're going to do well.

1111
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:14,439
All four crews will film the hidden section...

1112
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,270
with the choreography you create.

1113
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:18,840
In the final film mission video,

1114
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,186
the hidden section choreography of only one crew...

1115
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:24,509
that is chosen by the fight judges...

1116
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:25,550
will be shown.

1117
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:27,120
Like the director's cut.

1118
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:29,280
Yes. Maybe this is like the director's cut.

1119
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:32,220
There will be no additional points.

1120
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:34,960
It's just the judges' evaluation...

1121
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:40,830
Now, I will reveal the music and the concept for the hidden section.

1122
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:48,340
The concept for the hidden section is Flash Identity.

1123
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,540
The crew of the hidden section will appear...

1124
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:54,380
as the flash shines in a dark space.

1125
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,610
It's a section with a strong impact that matches the main section's.

1126
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,220
You could do many things there.

1127
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,450
It's about the idea.

1128
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:07,060
This is more about the idea than the dance.

1129
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,520
This is fun.

1130
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:10,289
(She automatically creates a move.)

1131
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:12,189
I want us to do this.

1132
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:15,059
I think we could make the choreography...

1133
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,700
in the style we were planning to go with.

1134
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:18,999
That hidden section is ours.

1135
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,870
No crew can do it better than us.

1136
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:23,840
It's as important as the main section.

1137
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:27,239
I think the more sections we get,

1138
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,979
- the better. - More opportunity.

1139
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,210
The crew that shows the most powerful presence...

1140
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:33,720
in the entire dance film video...

1141
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:37,890
will be chosen as the best dance crew...

1142
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:39,990
and will be given extra points.

1143
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,490
(The semi-final round is crazy.)

1144
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:44,490
That's good.

1145
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:48,299
I think Ojo Gang would feel nervous even though they have the main.

1146
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,669
Right. Everyone is determined.

1147
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:51,000
They're all determined.

1148
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:55,440
I don't think any crew is at an advantage here.

1149
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:57,770
We'll definitely become the best dance crew.

1150
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,839
We're going to be the best dance crew.

1151
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,910
Don't you worry.

1152
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:04,280
We did get the sub section,

1153
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,479
but best believe when we dance,

1154
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,450
we'll be the main characters.

1155
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:13,590
I'll just prove it through the dance rather than the talk.

1156
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:17,430
The semi-final, Dance Film Mission.

1157
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:19,329
The best dance crew is...

1158
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:22,259
What we show is very different and impactful.

1159
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,499
I've been doing it for 12 years. I'm very confident.

1160
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,739
I feel super confident...

1161
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,469
in satisfying the director.

1162
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:30,869
No one in Street Woman Fighter can do it.

1163
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:32,510
The best dance crew is...

1164
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:39,450
The crew that will compete in the final elimination battle.

1165
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:41,749
I'm just so upset.

1166
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:42,819
I'm not nervous.

1167
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:44,189
So, I was just ready to battle.

1168
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,090
I can't leave just yet.

1169
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,920
I don't want to go home yet.

1170
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:52,090
(The second round of the semi-final, Dance Film Mission)

1171
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:54,990
(The 4 crews are practicing to be the best dance crew.)

1172
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:59,129
We were able to rank first with fans' votes...

1173
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,999
and got to dance in the main section.

1174
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,339
With this momentum, to be the best dance crew,

1175
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:06,910
we'll do our best for every section of the Dance Film Mission.

1176
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,209
From now on, it's about strategy.

1177
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:10,550
There are only four teams left.

1178
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:14,949
The four crews are very distinct and have a unique character.

1179
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:16,749
It's about ideas now.

1180
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:18,049
We need to do something really impactful.

1181
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,289
- Yes. - Exactly.

1182
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:21,119
The hidden section.

1183
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,059
We, OSAKA Ojo Gang, will also get it.

1184
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:26,030
We said we'd do anything to win.

1185
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:29,129
Our teamwork has become stronger.

1186
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:32,599
We'll show the new side of OSAKA Ojo Gang...

1187
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,769
and also get the hidden section.

1188
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:37,409
I feel like OSAKA Ojo Gang...

1189
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:39,879
Because they won the main section,

1190
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,680
their part will just be boring. Because it'll be the same.

1191
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:46,110
So, I feel like they should be worried about AG SQUAD.

1192
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:51,650
The concept is neon. We might do something with body paint.

1193
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:55,959
We always push ourselves to keep creating exciting things...

1194
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,529
that really draw people in.

1195
00:50:57,530 --> 00:50:59,229
We want to...

1196
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:02,260
make our section the best section of the video.

1197
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,969
I'm very confident AG SQUAD will win the best dance crew in this mission.

1198
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:10,370
And we'll just show you why we should win the show.

1199
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,379
Sub section one will be a video...

1200
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:16,310
made with black and white aesthetics.

1201
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:19,549
"Let's make it look more important than the main section..."

1202
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:21,179
"to turn the tables."

1203
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:22,679
For the hidden track,

1204
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,489
once Lip J takes the lead,

1205
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:26,419
I'm really confident we'll get it.

1206
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:29,419
In the description, it said lots of flashes would go off.

1207
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,229
If so, what kind of movements...

1208
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:34,429
can catch people's eyes?

1209
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:36,230
We've been pondering a lot.

1210
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:40,539
I think this section is where we can show ourselves again...

1211
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:42,200
and catch people's attention.

1212
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:43,840
We'll be the best dance crew,

1213
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,240
no matter what.

1214
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:46,740
I really want to do it well.

1215
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:50,849
We still, even though we didn't get to choose our section,

1216
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:52,379
we got the section that we wanted.

1217
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,519
Winning best dance crew, I feel confident...

1218
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,079
in what we can bring to the table...

1219
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,189
because of just the specialty...

1220
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:00,619
that we bring to the table as far as...

1221
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,319
Logan, but then as far as...

1222
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,430
also my understanding of camera direction.

1223
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:07,330
All right, you all!

1224
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:09,829
We got this. We got the song we wanted.

1225
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:12,899
We're already moving in a direction that aligns with us...

1226
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,339
winning this entire thing.

1227
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,199
So, basically, let's go win.

1228
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,809
What's your...

1229
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:20,109
What's your MOTIV?

1230
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:21,980
(Everyone, get ready!)

1231
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,050
(The day of the Dance Film Mission)

1232
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:26,449
- Hello. - Hi.

1233
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:27,779
Hello.

1234
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,249
(Good morning.)

1235
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:31,019
(For the concept of the sub section, )

1236
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,619
(the 4 crews are getting ready.)

1237
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:36,889
Big transformation. I'll go from looking like a little boy to...

1238
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:39,489
You've never seen before.

1239
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:42,499
My hairstyle is a bit like a gang style today.

1240
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,600
Hollywood star.

1241
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,369
Like futuristic.

1242
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:48,370
I'll say...

1243
00:52:48,371 --> 00:52:50,309
glossy skin.

1244
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:51,710
Metallic?

1245
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:54,710
Like that? Or is that a liner?

1246
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,109
(Are you okay?)

1247
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:57,310
(Wary)

1248
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:59,149
There's no time to lose anymore.

1249
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:00,949
There's no more time to lose, so...

1250
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:03,420
AG SQUAD, we'll get to bring something new.

1251
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,020
Like that.

1252
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,430
(Big transformation with a strong style)

1253
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:13,260
It just goes.

1254
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:16,400
(Here is the original strong Korean girl)

1255
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,099
Other crews have strong images,

1256
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,569
so I have no choice but to do it like this.

1257
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,246
(Fighting spirits are rising in real time.)

1258
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:23,769
(Not quite satisfied)

1259
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:24,870
This isn't enough.

1260
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:26,939
I'm a queen.

1261
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:28,180
A ruined queen.

1262
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,150
Your hairstyle looks like Marlee's.

1263
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,709
(What?)

1264
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:34,880
You don't know what you're talking about.

1265
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:37,290
I think our concept has a big impact.

1266
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:39,620
I'm hopeful we could win.

1267
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:42,719
I feel confident that we could get chosen...

1268
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,459
because I feel like we're always the ones who are sticking out.

1269
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:47,900
Show them what being cool is.

1270
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,600
- Show them real hip-hop. - WEST COAST.

1271
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,069
- That... - American hip-hop.

1272
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:55,869
They're definitely going to choose us because...

1273
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:57,009
we're the coolest.

1274
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:59,239
We just look the coolest.

1275
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,009
Let's just win.

1276
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:02,010
- Yes. - Yes.

1277
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,679
I want to be the best dance crew no matter what.

1278
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,350
I'm really confident.

1279
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:08,849
- No more crying. - No more crying.

1280
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:10,649
No more tears left to cry.

1281
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:11,990
(The queen won't cry.)

1282
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:14,989
I still feel emotional...

1283
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:17,429
because we've gone through this rollercoaster...

1284
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:19,259
of winning, then losing.

1285
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:22,399
But that is okay. We can create something new.

1286
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,999
So, it's an opportunity.

1287
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,569
I'm confident that we'll do this better than anyone else.

1288
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:27,839
We should win no matter what.

1289
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,070
I really want to do it well.

1290
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:31,539
(All 4 crews are ready.)

1291
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:33,260
(The set for AG SQUAD's Dance Film Mission)

1292
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:35,040
(Something caught their eyes.)

1293
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,410
It's exciting.

1294
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:37,980
It's very exciting.

1295
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:40,549
I love the filming set.

1296
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:42,949
As soon as we walked in today, it was like...

1297
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:46,489
it gave us the energy and the excitement...

1298
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:47,819
to want to kill it.

1299
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:48,820
Look at that.

1300
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,060
That's so cool.

1301
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:53,700
(Smartphone camera?)

1302
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,829
(Dance Film Mission)

1303
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:57,169
(Smartphone)

1304
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:59,230
Are we filming with a real phone?

1305
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:03,910
(To dancers who always film their practice, )

1306
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,809
(a smartphone is such a familiar item.)

1307
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:09,640
There was just a phone camera, and we were like this.

1308
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,110
I was impressed.

1309
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:15,179
I've never used a phone to film something this high caliber.

1310
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:17,619
The look will feel completely different.

1311
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:19,819
This is very different from what we normally do.

1312
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:22,920
And I feel it just makes it more raw and real.

1313
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,129
- Have fun. - Yes!

1314
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:26,190
Let's go!

1315
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,459
I think this is cool because we haven't done this look yet.

1316
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:32,400
It's giving... Fierce.

1317
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,399
(Full of fierceness)

1318
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,809
Our theme and our concept is just...

1319
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:38,810
strong woman.

1320
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,909
Show how strong females are.

1321
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:43,950
(AG SQUAD starts filming.)

1322
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,420
(Leader Kaea is carefully monitoring it.)

1323
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:50,919
(Thinking)

1324
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:51,990
Stop!

1325
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:55,759
Adding more legs, like levels.

1326
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,230
Energy.

1327
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,659
Maybe a little bit down, Aaliyah.

1328
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,000
(They're watching.)

1329
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:04,399
(Full of energy)

1330
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,370
Go! Hey!

1331
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:09,339
You know, hard hitting and fast.

1332
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:10,540
It's different.

1333
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:13,909
I think our opening shot is pretty.

1334
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:16,339
Aaliyah and Vanessa who are face-to-face.

1335
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,549
We, three girls, who are dancing in the middle.

1336
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:20,949
It's a strong opening, and it is a different opening.

1337
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:23,549
The production today is high-class.

1338
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:25,689
So, I was looking around like this.

1339
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:26,690
Hey!

1340
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,320
We wanted to do different angles.

1341
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,860
Just something different from what we've normally done.

1342
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:33,800
Just to leave a strong impact.

1343
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:37,300
Do we look good?

1344
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:38,569
Face glowing hot.

1345
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:40,469
That's very visible.

1346
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:42,439
I feel like that's the most creative as well,

1347
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,569
so we could make a bigger impact than like...

1348
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:46,740
- Yes, we can do like body shades. - Yes.

1349
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:48,809
Because it's neon.

1350
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:51,980
So we wanted something different that we haven't done before.

1351
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,379
Put the neon paint all over my face.

1352
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:56,449
We wanted to make pictures with our bodies.

1353
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:58,449
We wanted to do different angles.

1354
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:00,189
It can show people that we can do...

1355
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:02,320
two different characters in one video.

1356
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:07,130
This is about to be a game-changer of a music clip.

1357
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:08,829
What is that?

1358
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:10,330
(Very satisfied)

1359
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:14,570
It gave us the energy and excitement.

1360
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:18,740
(AG SQUAD tried various things to leave a bigger impact.)

1361
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:21,180
We only need to keep going up from here.

1362
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,939
And just show that...

1363
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:26,210
AG SQUAD is taking over this competition.

1364
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:28,080
(Who is the next crew to film?)

1365
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:30,889
(Hip-hop vibe)

1366
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:33,449
It looks cool.

1367
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,760
(Jaw-dropping)

1368
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,060
I like that.

1369
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:39,530
It looks cool.

1370
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:41,859
The West Coast feel.

1371
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,359
- Are we allowed to go on it? - I miss this.

1372
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,370
This is cool.

1373
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,300
The track was titled, "West Coast Groove."

1374
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,739
As the only team representing hip-hop,

1375
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,709
we know a lot about the West Coast...

1376
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:53,639
and a lot about West Coast grooves.

1377
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,779
From the States.

1378
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:56,309
I'm literally from LA.

1379
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:58,780
Who else is going to do the West Coast better than us?

1380
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,240
(MOTIV starts filming right away.)

1381
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,480
Ready?

1382
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:03,450
(I'm ready too.)

1383
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:06,220
(Starting with a headspin)

1384
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:10,990
(MOTIV groove)

1385
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,729
(Perfectly done)

1386
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:17,029
(She nailed it.)

1387
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:18,769
I love it whenever we use Logan.

1388
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:20,539
Instead of it just feeling like a dance sequence,

1389
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:23,240
it's really impressive and eye-catching.

1390
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:25,169
This is what we're good at doing.

1391
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:26,810
I don't have any worries at all.

1392
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:30,280
(The next filming of MOTIV)

1393
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:32,079
(The choreography ended instantly.)

1394
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:35,879
I was trying to think about how I choreographed,

1395
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,420
but in sections.

1396
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:40,589
We have the thizzle dance,

1397
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:44,589
which is a movement that came from the Bay Area.

1398
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:47,559
Jerking, which was a dance movement...

1399
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,599
that originated in Los Angeles.

1400
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:53,099
Locking, which is a street style that originated in LA.

1401
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:55,769
I tried to incorporate the movement...

1402
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:57,869
that honors the West Coast.

1403
00:58:57,870 --> 00:58:59,339
I am confident that...

1404
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:02,939
we can get selected as the best dance crew because,

1405
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:06,279
you know, there's a depth to everything that MOTIV crew does.

1406
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,920
Our section two really showcases that.

1407
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,690
(The filming set of the main section for OSAKA Ojo Gang)

1408
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,660
This is amazing.

1409
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:19,330
(OSAKA Ojo Gang will film the main section on two sets.)

1410
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:21,759
The filming set for our main section was...

1411
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,599
in a large space...

1412
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,499
with lots of luxurious lighting,

1413
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,340
and it was a big enough stage.

1414
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:32,809
I'd like to choose the color of the lighting.

1415
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:35,210
The signature color of your team is green.

1416
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:39,010
But it looks similar to your Mega Crew Mission.

1417
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:41,150
I think red is better.

1418
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:42,549
Not this one,

1419
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:45,019
but with the white blinking,

1420
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:46,819
the red looks more intense.

1421
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:49,559
- We want to keep the gang vibe. - So, red?

1422
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,030
I like it. I like red.

1423
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:52,190
It's impactful.

1424
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:55,130
We look forward to it. Thank you.

1425
00:59:55,330 --> 00:59:58,100
(After discussing, they chose red lighting with white.)

1426
00:59:58,630 --> 00:59:59,970
Look.

1427
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:01,500
This looks good.

1428
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:03,199
This really looks good.

1429
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,240
How do I look?

1430
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,210
(Here comes Queen Kyoka.)

1431
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,210
(The Queen's swagger)

1432
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:11,710
Her fashion is sensible.

1433
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:12,950
Very sensible.

1434
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:16,020
(Stop meddling with my fashion.)

1435
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:17,689
Let's put on a face that shows we want to win.

1436
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:18,720
- Yes. - Yes.

1437
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:22,419
If you can't deliver the heart that you want to win,

1438
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:24,129
you'll end up going home.

1439
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:25,260
- Yes. - Understood.

1440
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,559
If you don't want to go home,

1441
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,060
show it on your face.

1442
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,400
- I'll stay. - She said she'd stay alone.

1443
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:32,900
I don't like that.

1444
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:36,370
- We'll start the shoot. - Okay. Standby.

1445
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,640
Camera.

1446
01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:39,539
- Camera. - Let's go!

1447
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:40,580
Let's go!

1448
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,319
- Cut. - Yes, cut.

1449
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,419
(After hearing the cut, )

1450
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:55,260
(OSAKA Ojo Gang went to monitor it right away.)

1451
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:00,159
(Yes, this is it.)

1452
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,730
(Applauding and cheering)

1453
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:03,360
I like it.

1454
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:06,370
- The suit looked good, didn't it? - Yes.

1455
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:08,599
It doesn't look like we're filming with a smartphone.

1456
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,269
- Not at all. - I forgot about that.

1457
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:11,270
It's cool.

1458
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:16,809
(Who's doing the medieval theme?)

1459
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:20,780
Sparta!

1460
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:24,649
The concept of the sub section we chose...

1461
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:27,189
was titled "RUINED QUEENS."

1462
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:30,729
The Colosseum set left a strong impression.

1463
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:33,829
Female warriors' fight, fighting spirit,

1464
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:38,030
and despair in the competition. We tried to show those.

1465
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:39,699
Even if we are ruined,

1466
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,439
we'll continue fighting.

1467
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,439
We put forward our fighting spirits.

1468
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,669
- Standby. - Okay. Let's have fun in the water.

1469
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:48,110
Imagine we're at a water park today.

1470
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,909
Since the movements are limited...

1471
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:52,549
because of the water,

1472
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:56,079
I thought about how we could...

1473
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,820
perform effectively.

1474
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:00,220
Like a scene from a movie...

1475
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:02,460
We wanted to make a dramatic scene.

1476
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:05,289
In a rainy temple,

1477
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:07,600
two queens fight.

1478
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,480
Are you ready, lead actress?

1479
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:11,069
- I'm ready. - Are you ready?

1480
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:12,070
I'm so ready.

1481
01:02:12,071 --> 01:02:14,439
She practiced really hard.

1482
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:17,709
For the moment of performing in the center,

1483
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:20,879
I practiced hard with caution...

1484
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,609
and responsibility in my mind.

1485
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:25,149
Are you confident that you'll be the best dance crew?

1486
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:27,519
- Of course. - I'm also confident because...

1487
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,689
Ri.hey and Aiki are going to do it. So I'm really confident.

1488
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:33,089
I'll do my best to be a supportive wing today.

1489
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:35,020
I was in the center last week.

1490
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:37,559
It was taken away from me right away.

1491
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,629
It was like a class mission between us...

1492
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:40,829
to choose the main dancer.

1493
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:44,130
But we have to show a good performance, not just the mood.

1494
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,929
So, we need to make...

1495
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:49,540
our movements clear in the rain.

1496
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,309
I'm not ruined.

1497
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:53,170
(Queen of immersion)

1498
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,839
- I'll keep the Queen's position. - To be ruined,

1499
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,039
you have too much jewelry.

1500
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,079
- Let's go. - Yes.

1501
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,720
I'll start the rain.

1502
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:04,250
Come on!

1503
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:06,820
Let's go!

1504
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:09,359
Ready. Action.

1505
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,880
(Starting the first shoot in the rain)

1506
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,429
(Aiki was flown away like a sheet of paper.)

1507
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:19,430
Are you okay?

1508
01:03:19,431 --> 01:03:21,000
- What happened? - It's embarrassing.

1509
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:23,909
- Really? - Like a tornado.

1510
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:24,986
(Aiki became a ruined queen as soon as it began.)

1511
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:27,280
Don't look at me. Please don't look at me.

1512
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:30,409
- Do you just want to do it now? - Let's do this.

1513
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:32,510
(Starting the first shoot again)

1514
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:36,750
(Losing her grasp on the hand and slipping because of the rain)

1515
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:41,120
(Continuing the tough shoot while falling down)

1516
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,020
Are you okay?

1517
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,130
- Oh, no. - What's wrong?

1518
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:47,529
- She slipped. - Are you okay?

1519
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:48,660
- Are you okay? - I'm fine.

1520
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,130
- Did you get hurt? - No. I'm fine.

1521
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:53,270
Actually, it hurt a lot.

1522
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:56,439
I don't think I have time...

1523
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:59,070
to be a crybaby now, so...

1524
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:02,610
I'm fine. I have to be fine for now.

1525
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:05,410
Ready. Action.

1526
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,480
She turned around well.

1527
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,049
- Let's make waves a bit lighter. - Yes.

1528
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:12,489
If you're ready, we'll just keep going.

1529
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:14,319
(Continuing filming without a break, immersing in the rain)

1530
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:15,520
Cut.

1531
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:17,590
- Look. - Look at her.

1532
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:19,930
My hair is completely soaked.

1533
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:22,929
I feel cold.

1534
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:24,899
The queen is going to be sick tomorrow.

1535
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,129
It was just for a moment.

1536
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:30,809
I wore them in the shoes.

1537
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:32,739
- Did you bring slippers? - Yes, I did.

1538
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:33,839
I didn't bring them here, though.

1539
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,979
(Ruined queens are squeezing the water out.)

1540
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:37,110
We're living like this.

1541
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:41,520
Ready. Action.

1542
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:43,480
Help me just once.

1543
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,789
(She has to practice not blinking her eyes.)

1544
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:47,359
(What is Aiki preparing?)

1545
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,590
You're good at it.

1546
01:04:48,990 --> 01:04:51,460
(In the music of RUINED QUEENS, )

1547
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:54,160
(Aiki is filming the fire part.)

1548
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,729
It was the scene where I was supposed to get wet.

1549
01:04:56,730 --> 01:05:01,569
But I thought fire was the opposite of it.

1550
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:03,490
There's the saying, "Go through fire and water."

1551
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:05,369
It almost came to an end.

1552
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:08,139
So, I feel like I want more of it.

1553
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:10,580
The best dance crew will be BUMSUP.

1554
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:12,750
I'm 200 percent sure.

1555
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:17,320
(Results day for the Dance Film Mission)

1556
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:28,730
Dance Film Mission is a mission...

1557
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:31,330
where each crew is assigned a section...

1558
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:35,170
and films it using a smartphone to complete a dance film...

1559
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,910
based on music themed around women.

1560
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,709
For the main section,

1561
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:42,639
OSAKA Ojo Gang ranked first...

1562
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:45,950
in the Global Public Evaluation and took it.

1563
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:48,019
BUMSUP took sub section one...

1564
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:50,849
with the concept of RUINED QUEENS and the female warriors.

1565
01:05:50,850 --> 01:05:53,689
MOTIV took sub section two with the concept...

1566
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:55,289
of WEST COAST GROOVE.

1567
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:59,889
AG SQUAD took sub section three with the concept...

1568
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:01,360
of the Neon Switch.

1569
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:02,929
The last hidden section is...

1570
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:05,629
the concept of Flash Identity,

1571
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:08,699
a powerful section where the main character is revealed...

1572
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:11,769
through flashes that go off in a dark space.

1573
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:13,739
The crew that takes the hidden section...

1574
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:16,310
will be chosen based on the Fight Judges Evaluation.

1575
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:17,880
I need to stop twitching.

1576
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:21,879
Our one is very strong, so I hope they like our one.

1577
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,280
Please.

1578
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:25,819
I think we'll get the hidden section.

1579
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:27,390
I'm really confident.

1580
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:30,419
We can't lose this.

1581
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:32,490
I really hope we'll be selected.

1582
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:34,659
I feel like what we did in comparison...

1583
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:36,299
to what I saw in the other teams...

1584
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:37,799
was a lot stronger.

1585
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:41,470
So, I think we have a good shot of getting this hidden section.

1586
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:45,809
Four crews left strong impressions with their hidden section,

1587
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:48,440
and the fight judges highly praised them.

1588
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:52,310
Who will get the hidden section in Dance Film Mission?

1589
01:06:52,950 --> 01:06:54,419
(Completing filming the main and sub sections)

1590
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:56,320
(Starting filming the hidden section)

1591
01:06:56,650 --> 01:06:58,389
(AG SQUAD is practicing the part where they use props.)

1592
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:59,689
Yes, I think more.

1593
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:01,790
Ready to give it our best today.

1594
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:04,889
I cried so much about the Mega Crew Mission.

1595
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:06,589
There's no time to lose anymore.

1596
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:08,329
Just ready to win.

1597
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:09,929
(Our leader is the best.)

1598
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:11,229
They're not wearing the same lip color. So, it's okay.

1599
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:12,230
(Checking the lip colors)

1600
01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:14,570
Yes, their lip colors are black.

1601
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,009
The concept for the hidden section is very futuristic.

1602
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:19,409
We wear glasses.

1603
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:21,339
It's a bit Matrixy.

1604
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:22,880
Strong women.

1605
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:24,779
(The first take blows everyone away.)

1606
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,480
(Very satisfied)

1607
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:27,919
Can we see the playback?

1608
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,719
(Monitoring carefully)

1609
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,449
Bring it out a little bit.

1610
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:33,149
Out a little bit.

1611
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:34,220
One more.

1612
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:36,459
- It looks cool. - They want to try one more time.

1613
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:39,190
- One more. - Okay, one more time. Okay.

1614
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:41,159
We were just hungry for it.

1615
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,899
In our choreography and in our performance,

1616
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:46,800
it shows that we really want it.

1617
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:48,970
Can you put your hands on it?

1618
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,539
Two, three, four. Yes.

1619
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:51,810
Faster. Too slow.

1620
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,110
Yes, like your hands.

1621
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:56,409
(Do it like this.)

1622
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:57,449
(I got it.)

1623
01:07:57,450 --> 01:07:59,479
Use your arms more than your body.

1624
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,350
Five, six, seven, run!

1625
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,349
(That is it!)

1626
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:06,989
(In awe)

1627
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:08,389
- Are you happy? - Yes.

1628
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:09,690
- Period. - Let's go.

1629
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,060
Please vote for us.

1630
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:13,359
- Thank you. - Thanks.

1631
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:16,529
- Thank you. - Thanks, everyone.

1632
01:08:16,530 --> 01:08:18,899
We're very confident in winning the hidden section.

1633
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:21,339
And we know that we're the best crew here.

1634
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:23,600
So, let's go.

1635
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:25,539
For your information, at the end,

1636
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:27,439
Ibuki will point at the camera,

1637
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,880
pull her hand back, and point at the camera again.

1638
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:32,709
Can we run that again with the camera moving?

1639
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:35,420
I might need to pass under the camera.

1640
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:38,689
(OSAKA Ojo Gang is checking the stage, focusing on the camera.)

1641
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:42,059
We're very aware that we're filming on a smartphone.

1642
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:44,759
(Dance Film Mission is filmed using a smartphone camera.)

1643
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,089
With the heavy camera?

1644
01:08:46,090 --> 01:08:48,429
With the professional camera, it's impossible...

1645
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:51,629
to follow fast to keep up with our speed...

1646
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:53,899
or catch every single rhythm...

1647
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:55,399
in each connected scene.

1648
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,099
(A lightweight camera captures the rhythmical flow of the dance.)

1649
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:00,110
Only a phone camera can do this.

1650
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:02,340
(Impressed)

1651
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,249
- It's fun. - It's pretty good.

1652
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:06,379
It must be really hard to sync with the camera movement.

1653
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:08,379
(Will it turn out as they want?)

1654
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:10,350
Nice! Yes!

1655
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:13,750
- It's awesome. - The camera followed us.

1656
01:09:13,890 --> 01:09:17,530
We practiced hard with camera movements since yesterday.

1657
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:22,200
The camera director was great, and we worked well together.

1658
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,500
I think it'll be a really great video.

1659
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:27,300
After doing this, I'll do this.

1660
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,139
- This one. - This one.

1661
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:31,170
- Yes, this one. - This one.

1662
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:34,039
Thanks to the fans, we ranked first...

1663
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,779
and got the main section of Dance Film Mission.

1664
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:39,479
That's why OSAKA Ojo Gang shows up at the very beginning.

1665
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:41,580
Starting from that, other crews show up.

1666
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:43,449
Then, OSAKA Ojo Gang shows up last,

1667
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:45,490
and OSAKA Ojo Gang finishes it.

1668
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:48,559
(OSAKA Ojo Gang is close to the last scene.)

1669
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,989
(How will it turn out?)

1670
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:51,829
(Good.)

1671
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:53,359
(A clean ending)

1672
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:55,660
If we don't get chosen for the hidden track,

1673
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,830
this story won't be able to be finished.

1674
01:09:58,330 --> 01:10:00,940
Hello. Good to see you.

1675
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,899
- Marlee. Nice to meet you, Andy. - Hello.

1676
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:06,109
I knew that it was important to establish...

1677
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:08,080
a good relationship with the director.

1678
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:10,279
MOTIV crew gets to thrive...

1679
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:13,609
whenever we do challenges that are on film...

1680
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:17,589
because I think direction is a really big strength of mine.

1681
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:20,589
I initially thought that it'd be like all in one frame.

1682
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:22,059
- So, we did have two... - Got it.

1683
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:23,989
- We did have two groups. But. - I see.

1684
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:25,060
Less people.

1685
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,260
I originally planned it to be like this.

1686
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,359
She wants to reduce the number of people.

1687
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,629
Marlee planned everything clearly.

1688
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:32,670
I'm not worried.

1689
01:10:33,370 --> 01:10:35,669
(Every take is going smoothly.)

1690
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:39,509
I just tried to create something visually pleasing to the eyes...

1691
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:42,480
but still had MOTIV's flavor.

1692
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:45,410
(As planned!)

1693
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:46,510
Yes!

1694
01:10:46,511 --> 01:10:47,591
(Every take is satisfying.)

1695
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,879
She's doing a head slide.

1696
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,789
- Head slide. - Head slide.

1697
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:53,249
(A breaking technique where you slide on your head)

1698
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:55,190
How does the floor feel? Possible?

1699
01:10:55,290 --> 01:10:56,290
(Gosh)

1700
01:10:56,291 --> 01:10:57,459
(Logistx seems uncomfortable on the floor.)

1701
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:58,460
(Stopping)

1702
01:10:58,461 --> 01:10:59,689
(Logistx seems uncomfortable on the floor.)

1703
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:00,759
(Thinking)

1704
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,459
There was tape on the floor.

1705
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:04,529
And I'd get stuck on the tape.

1706
01:11:04,530 --> 01:11:05,700
(Failing the 1st try)

1707
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:07,230
(Failing the 2nd try)

1708
01:11:07,770 --> 01:11:08,770
Is she all right?

1709
01:11:09,270 --> 01:11:10,799
- Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine.

1710
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,470
- I just can't slide with this tape. - Yes.

1711
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:15,709
What she does is already so physically demanding.

1712
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:19,309
So if something goes wrong and she's injured at all,

1713
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:20,909
that's like a huge concern of ours.

1714
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:24,219
We realize that Logan cannot do that trick anymore.

1715
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:26,920
We just had to think very quickly on our feet.

1716
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,460
Maybe hold the freeze and go to the flip.

1717
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:30,820
It can still be cool.

1718
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,260
So, no head slide. Just...

1719
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:34,630
(Marlee revised it quickly, considering the circumstances.)
Okay.

1720
01:11:35,631 --> 01:11:38,029
Just to avoid... Now that she's not doing the head slide...

1721
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:39,929
Just to avoid it, just make it be her back...

1722
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:41,600
for three counts while you come in.

1723
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,670
But we'll still have the impact of that.

1724
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:47,309
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1725
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:48,739
(Dance Film Footage)

1726
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:50,010
(Cheering)

1727
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:53,910
We definitely need to keep our eyes out for MOTIV.

1728
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,680
That was really strong.

1729
01:11:55,850 --> 01:12:00,189
I definitely think that we could get selected for the hidden mission...

1730
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:02,790
because it just looked so good.

1731
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:04,236
- Only this part is visible. - I see.

1732
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:05,929
The message we want to deliver is...

1733
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:08,199
- that I got the trophy in Season 1. - Yes.

1734
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,229
A special appearance.

1735
01:12:09,230 --> 01:12:13,070
It's the trophy I won as HolyBang in Season One.

1736
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:15,369
Although it's a competition,

1737
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:17,239
the trophy belongs to all of us.

1738
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:19,840
I want to deliver this message.

1739
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:22,109
Even at this angle, I want to look as if it's not being taken,

1740
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:23,410
but rather as a queen maker.

1741
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:26,179
All the crews worked so hard,

1742
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:28,380
and so many people loved all of us.

1743
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:31,720
I think HolyBang just received it on everyone's behalf.

1744
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:35,120
The last part of Dance Film Mission is the hidden section.

1745
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:38,790
We want to convey a meaningful message,

1746
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:41,230
rather than simply saying that we're the best.

1747
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:43,130
There is a dancer.

1748
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:45,999
And it's a story about overcoming criticism and difficulties.

1749
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,939
On one side, there are fingers pointing at her.

1750
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:50,600
On the other side, there are gentle hands comforting her.

1751
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:54,109
When the world of criticism and difficulties kidnaps Lip J,

1752
01:12:54,110 --> 01:12:56,010
she breaks it.

1753
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:59,679
She manages to escape, gets her strength from our cheers,

1754
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:01,180
and wins the trophy.

1755
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:03,419
That's a good idea.

1756
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:05,789
Her last trophy? That makes sense.

1757
01:13:05,790 --> 01:13:08,089
I think BUMSUP would be the team...

1758
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:10,619
that would give us a run for our money in this mission.

1759
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:13,160
It looks like they're using storytelling again.

1760
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:16,200
In the end, only one crew will win.

1761
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:19,070
But all of the crews were on the journey.

1762
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:21,900
All the dancers are winners, after all.

1763
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,300
That's the message I want to convey.

1764
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:26,569
- Great job. - Thank you, Director.

1765
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:28,679
We had a clear storytelling.

1766
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:30,109
We also used the props well.

1767
01:13:30,110 --> 01:13:32,310
Honestly, I have no doubt this time.

1768
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:35,920

(The leading producer of THE HUB, Brian U)

1781
01:14:17,090 --> 01:14:18,090
There are four sections,

1782
01:14:18,091 --> 01:14:19,389
which are 1 main section and 3 sub sections.

1783
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:22,999
I think the hidden section is the kick in this video.

1784
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Even for the music.

1785
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:26,600
The hidden section is based on Jersey club bass,

1786
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,639
- and you can develop from it. - That's good.

1787
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,070
That's how I made this music.

1788
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:33,509
The hidden section has a concept...

1789
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:36,139
that was derived from the idea of boldly expressing...

1790
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:39,049
things like identity through outward appearance,

1791
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:41,949
while also receiving those flashes.

1792
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:44,789
When the strobe lights are on,

1793
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:47,249
the images are visible and invisible in turns.

1794
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:50,089
That's why, when it's visible, it hits hard...

1795
01:14:50,090 --> 01:14:52,159
and is more impressive to people.

1796
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:54,130
When you have the strobe lights,

1797
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,440
- how will you use it effectively? - Okay.

1798
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:01,100
Then, now, we'll watch OSAKA Ojo Gang's hidden section.

1799
01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:06,570
Okay.

1800
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:09,010
That's so cool.

1801
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:17,549
Minami is a star.

1802
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:20,320
She is so raw, right?

1803
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:26,189
OSAKA Ojo Gang always carries the swag.

1804
01:15:26,190 --> 01:15:27,230
That's crazy.

1805
01:15:32,370 --> 01:15:35,599
(Applauding)

1806
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:36,940
I'm touched.

1807
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:39,870
Because with any music,

1808
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:41,940
they always seemed stuck...

1809
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:43,739
in two big shadows,

1810
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:46,380
Ibuki's waacking and Kyoka's hip-hop.

1811
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:50,549
But this time, I didn't feel Ibuki or Kyoka.

1812
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:53,820
It feels like they choreographed for only this music.

1813
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:55,790
It was the first time I felt this from them.

1814
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:57,260
I loved it.

1815
01:15:57,660 --> 01:16:00,490
All of them are such powerful individual characters.

1816
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:04,000
However, I do feel like for the hidden section...

1817
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:06,569
I think they still moved a certain way,

1818
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:08,999
very similar to how they treated the main section.

1819
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,509
It didn't feel like such a contrast from the main section.

1820
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:13,969
I feel like I wanted a little bit more from OSAKA Ojo Gang.

1821
01:16:13,970 --> 01:16:16,580
Especially if they're the winner of this challenge.

1822
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,750
Anyway, there are flashes that keep going off.

1823
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:21,479
I think they understood the point...

1824
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:24,079
that the light going off can be used as an editing point.

1825
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,719
Regarding that point, I remember having fun filming with them.

1826
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:31,859
But if I think about if they had something really impressive,

1827
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:35,159
I'm not sure and a bit disappointed.

1828
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:38,369
But I think the head movements were...

1829
01:16:38,370 --> 01:16:40,630
really impressive.

1830
01:16:40,830 --> 01:16:44,199
The movements at the end also looked great.

1831
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,970
For me, there are some points that were memorable.

1832
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:49,079
(Judges are split on the impact and diversity.)

1833
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:53,050
Now, we'll watch BUMSUP's hidden section.

1834
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:08,600
Lip J is a star.

1835
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,730
Lip J has the presence.

1836
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Oh, man.

1837
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:17,099
(Impressed)

1838
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:18,170
(It's cool.)

1839
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:20,540
I love this part.

1840
01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:25,909
(Perfect ending)

1841
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:27,180
Trophy ending?

1842
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:30,950
BUMSUP's superpower is the fact that...

1843
01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:33,190
Every single member of BUMSUP...

1844
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:34,890
has that star quality.

1845
01:17:34,990 --> 01:17:36,820
They switch who comes to the center.

1846
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:39,229
You feel such a different color...

1847
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:40,929
from each member in the crew, right?

1848
01:17:40,930 --> 01:17:43,900
I feel like this is just another example of them showing...

1849
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,570
just their experience in the game.

1850
01:17:46,770 --> 01:17:49,199
I think BUMSUP wanted...

1851
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,199
to tell more as it went on to the end.

1852
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,809
Their movement at the beginning looked like they thought too much.

1853
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:55,610
They might have a lot to say.

1854
01:17:55,710 --> 01:17:57,579
But I didn't feel clearly...

1855
01:17:57,580 --> 01:17:59,380
what they want to show.

1856
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:01,420
They had lots of things they wanted to express.

1857
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,179
Especially at the end,

1858
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:05,219
fingers pointing at her on one side,

1859
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:06,619
hands comforting her on the other side,

1860
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:09,360
and the dancer holding the trophy in the center.

1861
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:11,560
I don't think all the stories blended well.

1862
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:14,090
It feels like it's separated like water and oil.

1863
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:16,099
I felt that even during filming.

1864
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:17,759
(Each one's performance was good, but the storytelling was lacking.)

1865
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,730
Now, we'll watch MOTIV's hidden section.

1866
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:27,070
Swag!

1867
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:38,320
Crazy.

1868
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:40,619
(Impressed)

1869
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:42,290
So much variation.

1870
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,390
I love their vignettes.

1871
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:49,700
Bang!

1872
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,329
(Thrilled)

1873
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:56,040
(Touched)

1874
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,470
Marlee at the end, though?

1875
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:04,240
I feel like MOTIV is so smart.

1876
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:05,509
Because...

1877
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:07,249
for the Flash Identity...

1878
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:10,579
and the flashing strobe light feel,

1879
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:13,389
the choreography needs to be more like a picture.

1880
01:19:13,390 --> 01:19:18,529
MOTIV originally has the smooth hip-hop style.

1881
01:19:18,530 --> 01:19:20,329
As soon as there were that Flash Identity...

1882
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:21,559
and the added lighting,

1883
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:25,029
everything was just a neat picture, right?

1884
01:19:25,030 --> 01:19:27,669
They adjusted that. It was so memorable, right?

1885
01:19:27,670 --> 01:19:30,439
I think you guys really... MOTIV really killed it.

1886
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,139
The strobe light...

1887
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:36,509
was used in the 80s for b-boying and breaking.

1888
01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:38,849
The strobe light from the late 80s,

1889
01:19:38,850 --> 01:19:41,249
the breaking beats, and the breaking moves...

1890
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:43,549
make a set.

1891
01:19:43,550 --> 01:19:46,189
They understood that and added the moves.

1892
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:48,759
Marlee has so much talent.

1893
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:49,760
For sure.

1894
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:51,829
Lastly,

1895
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:55,260
let's check out AG SQUAD's hidden section.

1896
01:20:05,470 --> 01:20:07,140
The opening was done very well.

1897
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:08,740
(My goodness.)

1898
01:20:12,610 --> 01:20:13,910
(No way.)

1899
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:16,180
Come on!

1900
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:20,389
Crazy!

1901
01:20:20,390 --> 01:20:21,960
She killed that.

1902
01:20:27,690 --> 01:20:29,359
- Let's go. - Oh, my gosh.

1903
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,760
(They just marvel at it.)

1904
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:35,839
After the Mega Crew Mission, I think AG SQUAD is...

1905
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,900
a bit mad.

1906
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:38,440
Right?

1907
01:20:38,441 --> 01:20:40,739
And I feel like they really said,

1908
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:42,609
"Okay. Let's kill this challenge."

1909
01:20:42,610 --> 01:20:44,109
You can feel how aggressive it is,

1910
01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:45,649
and it really matches the music.

1911
01:20:45,650 --> 01:20:47,649
They paused when the music became faster.

1912
01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:50,519
To be honest, I expected headbanging or something like that.

1913
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:51,689
It was so cool.

1914
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:54,419
When the beats picked up the pace, they paused...

1915
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:55,760
and went expressionless.

1916
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:58,089
Yes. It was so creative.

1917
01:20:58,090 --> 01:20:59,289
(AG SQUAD's detailed moves and creativity shone.)

1918
01:20:59,290 --> 01:21:01,699
Which crew...

1919
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:05,529
understood and expressed the hidden section the best?

1920
01:21:05,530 --> 01:21:06,630
I think...

1921
01:21:06,730 --> 01:21:10,270
Whoever dances very differently for the strobe light...

1922
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:13,239
That's how you know they did the mission well.

1923
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:16,679
(Which crew will get the hidden section?)

1924
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:20,409
Which crew got the hidden section of the Dance Film Mission?

1925
01:21:20,410 --> 01:21:23,149
The performance video of the Dance Film Mission...

1926
01:21:23,150 --> 01:21:26,049
with the chosen crew of the hidden section...

1927
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:29,060
will be revealed now.

1928
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:30,759
(Expectant)

1929
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,460
(Curious)

1930
01:21:32,890 --> 01:21:34,190
Here it comes!

1931
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:35,600
I'm nervous.

1932
01:21:36,130 --> 01:21:37,899
Oh, my gosh. I'm shaking.

1933
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:40,470
I'm excited to watch it, but I'm scared.

1934
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:41,800
Come on!

1935
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,840
(Let's go.)

1936
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:53,810
(Cheering)

1937
01:21:56,420 --> 01:21:57,979
Here it comes!

1938
01:21:57,980 --> 01:21:59,989
- It's cool. - I'm a fan of Kyoka.

1939
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:01,319
It's stylish.

1940
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:02,660
It's so cool.

1941
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:05,160
Let's go.

1942
01:22:06,790 --> 01:22:07,829
It's Minami.

1943
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:08,830
(Focused)

1944
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:10,160
(Thumbs up for Minami)

1945
01:22:16,170 --> 01:22:18,169
(How cool)

1946
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:19,609
(That suits our tastes.)

1947
01:22:19,610 --> 01:22:20,610
That's nice.

1948
01:22:20,611 --> 01:22:21,739
(My goodness.)

1949
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:23,140
I love her so much.

1950
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:28,379
Seriously, Kyoka is...

1951
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:30,350
Fire!

1952
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,120
Seriously, Kyoka is...

1953
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:34,020
She's so good.

1954
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:35,459
Kyoka.

1955
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:36,460
That was good.

1956
01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:40,260
Nice.

1957
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:44,600
(Feeling proud)

1958
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,499
That's so cool!

1959
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:48,500
She's so cool.

1960
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:51,909
Nice. She's in green and they're all in black. That's fire.

1961
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:52,910
I like it.

1962
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:55,910
That's sick.

1963
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:01,379
(That's us!)

1964
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:02,750
(BUMSUP, let's go.)

1965
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:07,249
With the water?

1966
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:09,259
Hey, this is sick!

1967
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:10,660
Crazy!

1968
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,930
Yes, Aiki!

1969
01:23:13,790 --> 01:23:15,199
Water.

1970
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,200
Let's go.

1971
01:23:16,201 --> 01:23:17,960
Go, Aiki!

1972
01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:21,600
Let's go!

1973
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:24,540
Go, sexy! Hey!

1974
01:23:24,970 --> 01:23:26,270
- Hey! - Period!

1975
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:29,780
Come on, Aiki! You'd better work, Aiki!

1976
01:23:31,010 --> 01:23:32,780
(They go wild.)

1977
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:36,920
Come on! The fire?

1978
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:38,820
That was crazy! Magic!

1979
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,820
The fire was a good idea.

1980
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:45,530
That's hot.

1981
01:23:46,190 --> 01:23:48,260
The rain makes it look better.

1982
01:23:49,030 --> 01:23:51,229
They must've gone through a lot, right?

1983
01:23:51,230 --> 01:23:53,300
This is so difficult.

1984
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:56,420
(Let's switch up the atmosphere.)

1985
01:23:57,540 --> 01:23:59,740
(That's us!)

1986
01:24:01,610 --> 01:24:02,940
That's the West Coast groove.

1987
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,379
And she's from the West Coast.

1988
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:07,510
(They show off the beauty of real hip-hop.)

1989
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:10,950
They filmed it well.

1990
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:13,050
This is cool.

1991
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,230
(My goodness.)

1992
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:20,330
Good shot.

1993
01:24:20,331 --> 01:24:21,690
Fire!

1994
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:23,200
I love it.

1995
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,360
Come on.

1996
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:28,370
They did well.

1997
01:24:28,770 --> 01:24:30,970
- They definitely know the vibe. - They did well.

1998
01:24:32,170 --> 01:24:33,610
(Like this?)

1999
01:24:33,770 --> 01:24:34,770
That's right.

2000
01:24:42,050 --> 01:24:43,150
That's insane.

2001
01:24:44,450 --> 01:24:46,950
This opening shot is crazy.

2002
01:24:52,490 --> 01:24:53,889
That's a crazy shot.

2003
01:24:53,890 --> 01:24:55,399
They're breathing.

2004
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:56,400
That's incredible.

2005
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:57,600
That's incredible.

2006
01:24:58,470 --> 01:25:00,110
- That's incredible. - That's incredible.

2007
01:25:02,970 --> 01:25:03,970
You all are hot.

2008
01:25:03,971 --> 01:25:05,710
(So hot)

2009
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:10,379
(What was that just now?)

2010
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:11,440
Sick.

2011
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:13,250
Oh, my!

2012
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:16,610
They're in the dark. They're in the dark now.

2013
01:25:18,690 --> 01:25:20,020
Such a powerful shot.

2014
01:25:21,890 --> 01:25:23,490
That's so cool!

2015
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:27,930
(The hidden section will be revealed in 3, 2, 1.)

2016
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:29,960
Is it coming? It's coming.

2017
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:31,300
Which crew got it?

2018
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:34,200
Five, four...

2019
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:37,999
(Their hearts drop.)

2020
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,010
Let's go.

2021
01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:40,539
Let's just hope.

2022
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:41,910
- We got this. - Let's hope.

2023
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:44,439
- Please. - Please.

2024
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,349
I thought, "We can do it."

2025
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:47,450
I hoped that it'd be us.

2026
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:50,419
- Please let it be Lip J! - Oh, my gosh.

2027
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:51,679
Please.

2028
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:52,950
Please let it be Lip J.

2029
01:25:56,690 --> 01:25:58,189
Three, two,

2030
01:25:58,190 --> 01:25:59,359
- Which crew will it be? - one.

2031
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:00,759
(Which crew got the hidden section?)

2032
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:03,500
(The hidden section will be revealed in 3, 2, 1.)

2033
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,299
(The crew that got the hidden section, MOTIV)

2034
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:08,100
(They got the hidden section.)

2035
01:26:08,870 --> 01:26:10,069
(Deeply moved)

2036
01:26:10,070 --> 01:26:11,839
- Let's go! - Yes!

2037
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,640
Yes!

2038
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:16,340
(It's too bad.)

2039
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:19,350
It's too bad.

2040
01:26:19,410 --> 01:26:21,010
We did well too.

2041
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:23,079
(Disappointed)

2042
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:24,080
What?

2043
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:25,650
Really?

2044
01:26:27,290 --> 01:26:30,090
(Disappointed)

2045
01:26:31,790 --> 01:26:34,790
(There's flashing light, so please watch with discretion.)

2046
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:36,560
Period!

2047
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:39,530
Go, Bella!

2048
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:42,669
Yes!

2049
01:26:42,670 --> 01:26:44,170
Come on!

2050
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:49,380
They gave a performance that matched the given concept.

2051
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:56,080
They did well.

2052
01:26:58,080 --> 01:26:59,090
Let's go!

2053
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,020
Yes, Abby!

2054
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,520
Baddie Abby!

2055
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:06,530
This is incredible work.

2056
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:11,230
(Cheering)

2057
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:12,430
Crazy.

2058
01:27:12,431 --> 01:27:13,870
- We did it. - Yes.

2059
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:15,900
We did it.

2060
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,769
- Everyone did so well. - Yes.

2061
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:20,710
- That was a movie. - That was the best.

2062
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:23,579
Gosh, it's too bad.

2063
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:24,580
It's too bad.

2064
01:27:24,581 --> 01:27:27,710
They gave it to the crew that had the best approach for the film.

2065
01:27:27,910 --> 01:27:30,619
I think that the decisions MOTIV made...

2066
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:33,789
MOTIV really used the spotlight.

2067
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:36,359
And the power of the spotlight and their presentations...

2068
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:38,930
So I'm going to choose MOTIV.

2069
01:27:39,190 --> 01:27:42,359
Judging by the choreography and story,

2070
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:43,500
I'll choose MOTIV.

2071
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:45,059
For the hidden section,

2072
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:48,069
the crew that had the least number of takes was MOTIV.

2073
01:27:48,070 --> 01:27:50,869
That meant they knew their choreography by heart.

2074
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:52,069
Their expressions were perfect.

2075
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:55,039
When the strobe lights came on, I could tell that they planned...

2076
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:57,609
the impact of the choreography in their heads.

2077
01:27:57,610 --> 01:28:00,909
I want to choose MOTIV for the hidden section.

2078
01:28:00,910 --> 01:28:04,149
They used the method of bringing out the strobe light...

2079
01:28:04,150 --> 01:28:06,919
through both the performance and editing.

2080
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:10,990
Changing shots quickly at the necessary moments is crucial.

2081
01:28:11,190 --> 01:28:13,029
MOTIV did that the best.

2082
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:17,460
Thus, I think MOTIV did best for the hidden section.

2083
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:21,299
The crew that won the hidden section is MOTIV.

2084
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:22,300
Congratulations.

2085
01:28:22,301 --> 01:28:23,540
(This is exciting.)

2086
01:28:23,770 --> 01:28:25,169
We did it.

2087
01:28:25,170 --> 01:28:28,939
MOTIV got the hidden section.

2088
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:31,379
I feel really good.

2089
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:34,710
I feel like we looked good. So...

2090
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:37,419
I think the judges will feel that as well.

2091
01:28:37,420 --> 01:28:38,449
They did well.

2092
01:28:38,450 --> 01:28:39,990
It's too bad that we didn't get it.

2093
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:41,490
I'm annoyed.

2094
01:28:41,890 --> 01:28:43,860
- The next one is important, right? - Yes.

2095
01:28:43,990 --> 01:28:45,750
The hidden section doesn't come with points.

2096
01:28:46,690 --> 01:28:49,099
Now, it's time to announce the best dance crew...

2097
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:51,700
of the Dance Film Mission.

2098
01:28:52,670 --> 01:28:54,269
Only one crew...

2099
01:28:54,270 --> 01:28:57,940
will seize the title of the best dance crew.

2100
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:00,139
I'm excited about this one.

2101
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:01,140
(Me too)

2102
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:04,409
To be honest, we took the main section.

2103
01:29:04,410 --> 01:29:06,979
Thus, I think we're in the most advantageous position.

2104
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:09,880
OSAKA Ojo Gang will be the best dance crew no matter what.

2105
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:12,789
I think being picked for the hidden section alone...

2106
01:29:12,790 --> 01:29:14,949
is potentially a very good sign.

2107
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:19,160
It only makes sense that we win the best dance crew.

2108
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:20,789
I reckon we might win.

2109
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:22,859
I really want to win the best dance crew.

2110
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:24,359
Ours is very strong.

2111
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:26,129
We bring different things,

2112
01:29:26,130 --> 01:29:28,029
so I think the judges will appreciate...

2113
01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:29,340
how versatile we are.

2114
01:29:29,370 --> 01:29:31,899
This is our last chance to make it to the finals.

2115
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,539
(Let's go.)

2116
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:34,610
We need to do it.

2117
01:29:34,670 --> 01:29:36,540
We worked so hard.

2118
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:40,279
I think we gave a pretty charismatic performance.

2119
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:41,750
I think we have a chance.

2120
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:44,779
In the Dance Film Mission,

2121
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:47,820
which crew created the most memorable moment?

2122
01:29:48,090 --> 01:29:50,789
Which crew will win the title of the best dance crew...

2123
01:29:50,790 --> 01:29:54,360
and 100 bonus points?

2124
01:29:55,030 --> 01:29:57,099
Let's now think about the entire mission,

2125
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:59,229
not just the hidden section.

2126
01:29:59,230 --> 01:30:02,939
Which crew understood and expressed the mission the best?

2127
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:04,300
Let's talk about it.

2128
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:08,009
I was quite surprised since every crew was very creative.

2129
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:09,379
As for BUMSUP,

2130
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:12,349
they put a lot of care into the artistic aspect.

2131
01:30:12,350 --> 01:30:14,749
The black and white suited the performance very well.

2132
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:17,319
The concept was "RUINED QUEENS."

2133
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:19,349
I could feel desperation and determination.

2134
01:30:19,350 --> 01:30:20,549
The overall performance was very cool.

2135
01:30:20,550 --> 01:30:24,520
Dancing with water is a very difficult situation. Right?

2136
01:30:24,690 --> 01:30:26,490
So I have so much respect.

2137
01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:29,129
The main section had the slow hip-hop vibe...

2138
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:31,429
and charisma.

2139
01:30:31,430 --> 01:30:33,869
OSAKA Ojo Gang always carries the swag.

2140
01:30:33,870 --> 01:30:36,769
All of them are such powerful, individual characters.

2141
01:30:36,770 --> 01:30:40,009
I could feel once again that this crew knows how to accentuate...

2142
01:30:40,010 --> 01:30:41,409
their strengths.

2143
01:30:41,410 --> 01:30:45,439
For me, MOTIV had the cleanest angle. Right?

2144
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,549
They had the most number of memorable moments.

2145
01:30:48,550 --> 01:30:50,249
MOTIV is really smart.

2146
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:53,949
They came up with the choreography with the angles in mind.

2147
01:30:53,950 --> 01:30:56,260
You can feel it when you watch the video for sure.

2148
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:58,459
If we think about which crew pulled off the concept the best,

2149
01:30:58,460 --> 01:30:59,460
it's AG SQUAD.

2150
01:30:59,461 --> 01:31:01,489
The look, their costumes, the vibe...

2151
01:31:01,490 --> 01:31:03,399
It matches, and it actually leaves...

2152
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:04,899
the most accurate impression.

2153
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:07,669
They were cool since the energy they exuded was so intense.

2154
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:10,669
Also, AG SQUAD has the director's eyes...

2155
01:31:10,670 --> 01:31:12,239
when they create. Right?

2156
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:14,939
It's not creating just a dance concept video.

2157
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:17,180
In the end, we need to pick 1 of these 4 dance crews.

2158
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:21,250
The best dance crew of this mission is...

2159
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:25,319
In the semi-final, the Dance Film Mission,

2160
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:26,950
the best dance crew is...

2161
01:31:27,950 --> 01:31:29,120
Oh, my gosh.

2162
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:31,660
I'm actually very nervous.

2163
01:31:31,790 --> 01:31:33,330
We'll be chosen for sure.

2164
01:31:33,730 --> 01:31:35,190
Please.

2165
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:36,660
Let us be the best dance crew.

2166
01:31:37,230 --> 01:31:38,660
Let's go.

2167
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:41,370
What?

2168
01:31:41,371 --> 01:31:42,870
(What?)

2169
01:31:42,970 --> 01:31:45,100
(Surprised)

2170
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:48,140
AG SQUAD.

2171
01:31:48,370 --> 01:31:49,379
Wait, what?

2172
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:50,856
(The best dance crew of the Dance Film Mission, AG SQUAD)

2173
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:51,940
Wait, what?

2174
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:54,580
(We accept the result.)

2175
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:56,679
Period.

2176
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:58,250
One hundred bonus points is strong.

2177
01:31:58,380 --> 01:31:59,389
Thank you.

2178
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:00,390
What?

2179
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:03,319
I thought that was a glitch.

2180
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:05,119
We're up. Hey, we're up.

2181
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:06,160
Yes!

2182
01:32:06,830 --> 01:32:09,560
We're AG SQUAD. Yes.

2183
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:12,499
The thing is, this mission has...

2184
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:13,599
a clear theme.

2185
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:15,399
It's one word. Woman. Right?

2186
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:18,869
When we play a video without mentioning the theme,

2187
01:32:18,870 --> 01:32:21,640
people will need to think of the word, "Woman."

2188
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:23,579
That would be the ideal work.

2189
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:26,779
Do you remember the first shot of AG SQUAD's section?

2190
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:28,550
That shows the theme.

2191
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:30,779
The theme of woman,

2192
01:32:30,780 --> 01:32:33,749
dance, and video blend in.

2193
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:35,889
Then they pulled off the choreography...

2194
01:32:35,890 --> 01:32:39,390
and theme in their own style.

2195
01:32:40,030 --> 01:32:41,589
I think...

2196
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:44,530
AQ SQUAD was one level above in this mission.

2197
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:45,800
Seriously.

2198
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:47,929
Both the picture and the dance had wow moments.

2199
01:32:47,930 --> 01:32:50,199
The dance crew that had the harmony of all elements...

2200
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:51,669
was AG SQUAD.

2201
01:32:51,670 --> 01:32:54,310
If I have to choose one, I'll go with AG SQUAD.

2202
01:32:54,870 --> 01:32:57,280
I think AG SQUAD did best.

2203
01:32:57,980 --> 01:33:00,349
Yes. We're very happy and very grateful.

2204
01:33:00,350 --> 01:33:01,510
I'm not crying today.

2205
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:03,320
(He bursts out laughing.)

2206
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:06,350
- Oh, my gosh. No tears. - No tears.

2207
01:33:06,990 --> 01:33:08,596
(Announcement of the results of the Mega Crew Mission)

2208
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:10,689
(AG SQUAD placed 5th in the Mega Crew Mission.)

2209
01:33:10,690 --> 01:33:11,989
(I hate this.)

2210
01:33:11,990 --> 01:33:13,859
We needed to redeem ourselves...

2211
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:17,260
So we worked our bottoms off to get to where we got to.

2212
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:19,230
That's so cool.

2213
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:21,299
- That's crazy. I'm shook. - Congratulations, AG SQUAD.

2214
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:24,499
Being named the best dance crew is such a blessing.

2215
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:26,269
And we're just super grateful.

2216
01:33:26,270 --> 01:33:27,869
We're just going to keep working hard.

2217
01:33:27,870 --> 01:33:28,910
They did really well.

2218
01:33:29,210 --> 01:33:30,240
They did well.

2219
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:33,379
- Double trouble. - Do they get a hundred?

2220
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:35,750
- This is incredible. - AG SQUAD got their wings.

2221
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:37,750
I see.

2222
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:39,690
I'm very upset.

2223
01:33:40,890 --> 01:33:41,890
It's too bad.

2224
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:43,960
Isn't this really serious?

2225
01:33:44,990 --> 01:33:47,860
The semi-final round of World of Street Woman Fighter...

2226
01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:50,660
consisted of two missions,

2227
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:54,930
Global Artist Performance Mission and Dance Film Mission.

2228
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:58,600
In the Global Artist Performance Mission,

2229
01:33:58,870 --> 01:34:02,580
AG SQUAD was chosen by Saweetie...

2230
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:05,310
and received 100 bonus points.

2231
01:34:05,580 --> 01:34:08,010
- That's pretty nice to see. - That's so nice.

2232
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:10,280
- Guys, this is so good. - Good job, girls.

2233
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:12,120
They're cool.

2234
01:34:12,850 --> 01:34:13,850
Period.

2235
01:34:14,420 --> 01:34:17,189
In the Dance Film Mission as well,

2236
01:34:17,190 --> 01:34:20,630
AG SQUAD was chosen as the best dance crew...

2237
01:34:20,790 --> 01:34:23,860
and received 100 bonus points once more.

2238
01:34:25,530 --> 01:34:26,700
We won both.

2239
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:27,800
We're crazy.

2240
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:30,840
AG SQUAD took all the bonus points.

2241
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:32,410
All of us have zero points?

2242
01:34:33,870 --> 01:34:34,870
It's too bad.

2243
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:38,710
The only thing that remains...

2244
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:40,949
is the Global Public Evaluation score...

2245
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:43,320
that's determined by the global fans' votes.

2246
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:44,780
That's the important thing.

2247
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:48,850
- I still get scared. - I still get scared too.

2248
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:51,359
The Global Public Evaluation score is...

2249
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:54,289
a combination of the number of views...

2250
01:34:54,290 --> 01:34:58,299
and the number of likes multiplied by 100.

2251
01:34:58,300 --> 01:34:59,830
Then the rankings will be compiled.

2252
01:35:00,330 --> 01:35:02,799
The crew that places first in the Global Public Evaluation...

2253
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:03,899
will receive 1,000 points.

2254
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:05,839
The crews that placed 2nd to 4th...

2255
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:08,439
will receive the lower scores that match their rankings.

2256
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:09,440
(They will receive the lower scores that match their rankings.)

2257
01:35:09,441 --> 01:35:11,540
It's getting a bit scary.

2258
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:13,880
- Honestly, I'm so nervous. - I know.

2259
01:35:14,050 --> 01:35:16,020
I'm so nervous, Aaliyah.

2260
01:35:17,450 --> 01:35:21,089
Now, I'll announce the final rankings...

2261
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:24,060
with the Global Public Evaluation score combined.

2262
01:35:24,390 --> 01:35:27,659
The first crew to earn the position of finalist is...

2263
01:35:27,660 --> 01:35:28,690
Who is it?

2264
01:35:29,660 --> 01:35:31,630
Hopefully, surely... Come on.

2265
01:35:31,860 --> 01:35:34,930
I'll announce the crew that placed first.

2266
01:35:35,070 --> 01:35:37,870
Now, we have 200 bonus points.

2267
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:40,970
So that gave us the hope that we had a chance to win.

2268
01:35:41,910 --> 01:35:43,780
- I got butterflies in my stomach. - Yes.

2269
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:47,349
Here comes the number of views each crew received...

2270
01:35:47,350 --> 01:35:48,656
for the Global Public Evaluation.

2271
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:52,020
BUMSUP got 2,800,141 views.

2272
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:56,920
OSAKA Ojo Gang got 2,673,866 views.

2273
01:35:57,020 --> 01:36:01,590
AG SQUAD got 2,451,780 views.

2274
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:06,530
MOTIV got 1,462,376 views.

2275
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:08,470
Did BUMSUP place first?

2276
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:10,100
In terms of views, yes.

2277
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:11,840
We can turn the tables.

2278
01:36:12,910 --> 01:36:15,739
We had a high number of views,

2279
01:36:15,740 --> 01:36:16,940
so we were a bit expectant.

2280
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:19,850
I'm actually really nervous...

2281
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:22,280
because we got the second to last in views.

2282
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:24,320
We have bonus points,

2283
01:36:24,350 --> 01:36:26,150
but I'm a little nervous.

2284
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:27,919
The number of likes...

2285
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:31,259
the first-place crew received for the Global Public Evaluation...

2286
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:32,790
will be revealed first.

2287
01:36:37,030 --> 01:36:38,259
The number of likes was high...

2288
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:39,946
- compared to the number of views. - It was very high.

2289
01:36:39,970 --> 01:36:41,630
I hope that's us.

2290
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:43,400
I don't know.

2291
01:36:43,870 --> 01:36:44,870
Let's go.

2292
01:36:45,070 --> 01:36:47,109
The crew that placed first in the semi-final round...

2293
01:36:47,110 --> 01:36:49,140
of the World of Street Woman Fighter is...

2294
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:52,510
Who is it? Who could it be?

2295
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:55,450
Purple!

2296
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:05,559
- Yes! - Oh, yes.

2297
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:06,689
Finals?

2298
01:37:06,690 --> 01:37:08,690
(Are we going to the finals?)

2299
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:12,999
- Oh, my gosh. - We did it.

2300
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,000
(We're going to the finals!)

2301
01:37:14,001 --> 01:37:15,800
- Good job. - Good job. Yes.

2302
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:18,040
That's incredible.

2303
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:20,069
- They placed first in everything. - They got the perfect score.

2304
01:37:20,070 --> 01:37:21,070
- They got the perfect score. - That's incredible.

2305
01:37:21,071 --> 01:37:22,609
AG SQUAD...

2306
01:37:22,610 --> 01:37:25,279
placed first in the Global Public Evaluation...

2307
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:27,150
and received 1,000 points.

2308
01:37:27,610 --> 01:37:30,220
With 100 bonus points from Saweetie...

2309
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:33,319
and 100 bonus points from being the best dance crew,

2310
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:36,159
their total score is 1,200 points, which is the perfect score.

2311
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:38,360
They placed first in the final rankings.

2312
01:37:38,660 --> 01:37:40,560
It was a landslide victory in every aspect.

2313
01:37:41,490 --> 01:37:43,760
That was intense.

2314
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:46,470
Thank you.

2315
01:37:47,770 --> 01:37:48,770
They deserved it.

2316
01:37:48,771 --> 01:37:50,140
(They deserved the 1st place.)

2317
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:55,640
We're so grateful and blessed to get such an amazing score.

2318
01:37:56,140 --> 01:37:58,809
These girls work hard. We work hard. So...

2319
01:37:58,810 --> 01:38:00,180
let's win this competition.

2320
01:38:00,650 --> 01:38:01,750
Thank you.

2321
01:38:01,780 --> 01:38:03,679
(Congratulations)

2322
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:04,880
Off we go.

2323
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:06,790
That's it.

2324
01:38:07,050 --> 01:38:08,550
Now,

2325
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:11,320
I'll announce the crew that placed fourth...

2326
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:14,659
and thus will face the Elimination Battle...

2327
01:38:14,660 --> 01:38:16,900
one step before the finals.

2328
01:38:19,870 --> 01:38:21,310
He's starting with the fourth place.

2329
01:38:21,930 --> 01:38:24,300
It means that at this point, my head starts hurting.

2330
01:38:26,170 --> 01:38:30,710
BUMSUP, MOTIV, and OSAKA Ojo Gang's rankings...

2331
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:33,850
will only be determined...

2332
01:38:33,910 --> 01:38:35,880
by the Global Public Evaluation score.

2333
01:38:36,020 --> 01:38:38,450
The number of views and likes will determine the score.

2334
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:40,390
The fourth-place crew...

2335
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:43,520
that'll need to prepare for the last battle before the final...

2336
01:38:43,690 --> 01:38:45,560
will be revealed now.

2337
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:46,960
That could be anyone.

2338
01:38:47,890 --> 01:38:49,770
AG SQUAD placed first in terms of likes, right?

2339
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:51,500
I think so.

2340
01:38:52,770 --> 01:38:54,000
I can't make any predictions.

2341
01:38:55,630 --> 01:38:57,600
I was a bit nervous.

2342
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:00,610
Please don't let it be us.

2343
01:39:01,210 --> 01:39:04,410
(Which crew will place 4th and enter the last Elimination Battle?)

2344
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:12,950
(4th place in the semi-final round, MOTIV)

2345
01:39:13,290 --> 01:39:14,720
MOTIV did well.

2346
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:16,090
MOTIV must be disappointed.

2347
01:39:18,990 --> 01:39:20,289
MOTIV...

2348
01:39:20,290 --> 01:39:24,359
received 1,462,376 views...

2349
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:28,370
and 203,929 likes.

2350
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:31,470
They took fourth place, the last place.

2351
01:39:32,270 --> 01:39:34,170
This is just so devastating.

2352
01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:35,970
I'm furious.

2353
01:39:37,180 --> 01:39:38,280
We're prepared.

2354
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:40,150
I'm very much prepared.

2355
01:39:41,180 --> 01:39:44,149
MOTIV, please prepare for the Elimination Battle.

2356
01:39:44,150 --> 01:39:45,830
(MOTIV will enter the Elimination Battle.)

2357
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:48,790
Now, BUMSUP...

2358
01:39:49,490 --> 01:39:51,160
and OOSAKA Ojo Gang remain.

2359
01:39:51,690 --> 01:39:53,890
Only the two crews' results remain.

2360
01:39:54,690 --> 01:39:58,159
One of the two crews will become a finalist...

2361
01:39:58,160 --> 01:39:59,730
on the final stage.

2362
01:40:00,100 --> 01:40:03,069
The other crew will stand at the edge of the cliff...

2363
01:40:03,070 --> 01:40:05,200
that is the Elimination Battle.

2364
01:40:06,140 --> 01:40:08,139
(Sighing)

2365
01:40:08,140 --> 01:40:10,510
I want to get chosen no matter what.

2366
01:40:11,110 --> 01:40:12,640
Please.

2367
01:40:13,150 --> 01:40:15,580
Gosh. This is stressing me out.

2368
01:40:17,180 --> 01:40:18,720
Survival versus elimination.

2369
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:22,650
I'll first reveal the two crews' number of views...

2370
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:25,090
that'll determine their fate.

2371
01:40:27,660 --> 01:40:28,730
It's close.

2372
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:30,360
The difference is 130,000.

2373
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,130
There's only a slight difference.

2374
01:40:33,230 --> 01:40:34,569
(Announcement of the results of the main section)

2375
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:36,239
(The crew that placed 1st in the number of views...)

2376
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:38,939
(is OSAKA Ojo Gang.)

2377
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:41,869
(The difference in the views against BUMSUP in the 2nd place...)

2378
01:40:41,870 --> 01:40:43,939
(is about 150,000.)

2379
01:40:43,940 --> 01:40:46,850
Yes. BUMSUP and OSAKA Ojo Gang were really close.

2380
01:40:47,380 --> 01:40:50,620
(1st place with the number of likes)

2381
01:40:50,780 --> 01:40:53,720
OSAKA Ojo Gang had more likes than I imagined.

2382
01:40:54,350 --> 01:40:58,090
We had placed first in terms of views,

2383
01:40:58,190 --> 01:41:00,130
but I was a bit nervous.

2384
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:02,900
I reckon OSAKA Ojo Gang beat them.

2385
01:41:03,530 --> 01:41:04,599
Oh, yes.

2386
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:06,599
I reckon OSAKA Ojo Gang beat them with likes.

2387
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:07,930
- With the likes? - Yes.

2388
01:41:08,930 --> 01:41:12,200
There isn't a big difference in the views, so we have a chance.

2389
01:41:13,210 --> 01:41:16,479
Will BUMSUP, the crew who got more views,

2390
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:20,380
receive more likes and advance to the finals?

2391
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:25,320
Will OSAKA Ojo Gang turn the tables with the number of likes...

2392
01:41:25,650 --> 01:41:27,290
and advance to the finals?

2393
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:30,560
The crew that placed second and will advance to the finals...

2394
01:41:30,660 --> 01:41:32,790
will be announced now.

2395
01:41:33,590 --> 01:41:36,030
I don't know how many likes we got.

2396
01:41:36,630 --> 01:41:38,700
I hope we win.

2397
01:41:39,230 --> 01:41:41,600
We're truly confident.

2398
01:41:42,370 --> 01:41:43,470
Please.

2399
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:47,340
It's close. I don't even know. I don't even know at this point.

2400
01:41:47,770 --> 01:41:51,840
The two crews' fate will be revealed at the same time.

2401
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:56,110
Who's going to win?

2402
01:41:56,450 --> 01:41:58,350
(BUMSUP?)

2403
01:41:58,450 --> 01:42:00,320
(OSAKA Ojo Gang?)

2404
01:42:00,420 --> 01:42:01,989
(Which crew will advance to the finals...)

2405
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:03,596
(and redeem themselves from the Elimination Battle?)

2406
01:42:03,620 --> 01:42:06,230
The crew that placed second in the semi-final round is...

2407
01:42:06,730 --> 01:42:09,500
We have to win no matter what. We must win.

2408
01:42:10,330 --> 01:42:12,000
We're very confident.

2409
01:42:14,930 --> 01:42:17,070
(Which crew will place 2nd in the semi-final round?)

2410
01:42:20,070 --> 01:42:24,110
The two crews' fate will be revealed at the same time.

2411
01:42:24,210 --> 01:42:26,980
We have to win no matter what. We must win.

2412
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:29,450
We don't want to go home.

2413
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:32,050
We're very confident.

2414
01:42:32,150 --> 01:42:34,120
We can't get eliminated in this round.

2415
01:42:34,550 --> 01:42:37,090
The crew that placed second in the semi-final round is...

2416
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:38,919
Please let us win this once.

2417
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:41,430
Please save us.

2418
01:42:41,530 --> 01:42:43,530
(OSAKA Ojo Gang?)

2419
01:42:48,930 --> 01:42:51,200
(Really?)

2420
01:42:51,370 --> 01:42:53,210
(Tearing up)

2421
01:42:53,510 --> 01:42:54,970
(We won!)

2422
01:42:55,370 --> 01:42:58,110
(Startled)

2423
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:00,280
It's BUMSUP.

2424
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:04,480
(My goodness.)

2425
01:43:05,950 --> 01:43:08,419
Had we received 100 bonus points...

2426
01:43:08,420 --> 01:43:10,120
I know. The difference is 10,000.

2427
01:43:10,420 --> 01:43:11,990
OSAKA Ojo Gang...

2428
01:43:12,290 --> 01:43:16,900
received 2,673,866 views...

2429
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:21,670
and 369,768 likes.

2430
01:43:22,070 --> 01:43:24,470
They took second place.

2431
01:43:24,970 --> 01:43:28,510
We just feel very happy right now.

2432
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:32,310
The crew members worked very hard for this season.

2433
01:43:32,380 --> 01:43:37,750
We'll show you what we can do in the finals.

2434
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:43,090
BUMSUP received 2,800,141 views...

2435
01:43:43,490 --> 01:43:47,590
and 357,079 likes.

2436
01:43:47,990 --> 01:43:50,760
They took third place.

2437
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,000
BUMSUP, please prepare for the Elimination Battle.

2438
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:57,700
I was so upset,

2439
01:43:58,340 --> 01:44:00,770
but I tried to accept the situation as is.

2440
01:44:01,410 --> 01:44:03,110
We'll do our best to show everyone.

2441
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:07,480
Thus, the crews that will enter the last Elimination Battle...

2442
01:44:07,850 --> 01:44:10,410
for the ticket to the finals of World of Street Woman Fighter...

2443
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:12,580
are BUMSUP and MOTIV.

2444
01:44:13,820 --> 01:44:16,790
We'll think of this as our last chance and win.

2445
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:19,889
We're very much looking forward to battling.

2446
01:44:19,890 --> 01:44:22,030
We were ready to take you on and beat you.

2447
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:26,529
(Elimination Battle, BUMSUP versus MOTIV)

2448
01:44:26,530 --> 01:44:28,890
(After the final rankings for the semi-finals got revealed)

2449
01:44:29,170 --> 01:44:30,700
What?

2450
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:34,640
(What surprised OSAKA Ojo Gang?)

2451
01:44:35,110 --> 01:44:38,310
(The Korean coffee truck for OSAKA Ojo Gang)

2452
01:44:38,380 --> 01:44:40,580
(This is incredible.)

2453
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:41,709
Look at this.

2454
01:44:41,710 --> 01:44:44,319
(It's a sign of support with the crew members' names.)

2455
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,420
(Very moved)

2456
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:49,419
(Their energy level is at its max.)

2457
01:44:49,420 --> 01:44:52,720
There's a group of people called Midoris in our world.

2458
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:54,959
The coffee truck they sent arrived,

2459
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:57,000
so we were truly happy.

2460
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,729
(Thank you.)

2461
01:44:59,730 --> 01:45:00,770
I want a photo too.

2462
01:45:02,070 --> 01:45:05,270
We could give better performances...

2463
01:45:05,370 --> 01:45:07,670
thanks to your support.

2464
01:45:07,770 --> 01:45:10,040
We'll win the finals.

2465
01:45:10,510 --> 01:45:12,410
We've done well so far.

2466
01:45:12,510 --> 01:45:14,209
We'll really win no matter what.

2467
01:45:14,210 --> 01:45:15,210
(Burning passion)

2468
01:45:15,980 --> 01:45:18,679
- Hey, guys. - Hey.

2469
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:20,950
Oh, my goodness. What just happened there?

2470
01:45:21,490 --> 01:45:24,190
Let's have a little cheers and congratulations.

2471
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:26,159
A little cheers.

2472
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:27,359
- Yes. - Yes.

2473
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:28,689
We're going to the finals...

2474
01:45:28,690 --> 01:45:31,599
and we're going to win World of Street Woman Fighter.

2475
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:35,430
(Congratulations on advancing to the finals.)

2476
01:45:35,630 --> 01:45:36,800
Look in the eye.

2477
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:39,399
We have to because we are going to win.

2478
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:40,939
(AG SQUAD clinks their bottles with eye contact.)

2479
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:42,170
- All right. Ready? - Cheers.

2480
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:44,609
(They take a refreshing sip.)

2481
01:45:44,610 --> 01:45:45,840
It's so good!

2482
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:48,250
This is the best soda I've ever had.

2483
01:45:48,610 --> 01:45:50,250
- Yes. - The orange is fizzy.

2484
01:45:50,650 --> 01:45:52,619
- It's actually refreshing. - Yes, I like it.

2485
01:45:52,620 --> 01:45:54,219
- It's so refreshing. - It's actually good.

2486
01:45:54,220 --> 01:45:57,590
You know, we're so lucky we don't have to battle today.

2487
01:45:58,090 --> 01:46:00,660
You know, Team USA and Team Korea...

2488
01:46:00,990 --> 01:46:02,330
are competing against each other.

2489
01:46:02,830 --> 01:46:06,469
This is sad, though. The reality is that one of them is going.

2490
01:46:06,470 --> 01:46:07,729
(Sad)

2491
01:46:07,730 --> 01:46:10,569
MOTIV has the battling skills.

2492
01:46:10,570 --> 01:46:13,909
But so does BUMSUP. You know, Lip J and some of the other girls.

2493
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:16,610
It's going to be hard for the judges.

2494
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:19,339
- I really love BUMSUP... - I want MOTIV too.

2495
01:46:19,340 --> 01:46:21,250
And I really love MOTIV.

2496
01:46:21,350 --> 01:46:26,149
Like, personally. We genuinely care about them

2497
01:46:26,150 --> 01:46:27,220
Both of them.

2498
01:46:27,550 --> 01:46:29,389
Then let's cheer these two teams on.

2499
01:46:29,390 --> 01:46:30,689
- That's right. - Yes.

2500
01:46:30,690 --> 01:46:31,690
Let's go.

2501
01:46:32,390 --> 01:46:35,089
When else will we get to battle as one team?

2502
01:46:35,090 --> 01:46:36,459
It's so reassuring. We're usually rivals...

2503
01:46:36,460 --> 01:46:38,359
- when we enter competitions. - I know.

2504
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:39,500
Here, we're the same team.

2505
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:41,100
This will go down in history.

2506
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:44,699
We thought that we could enter the Elimination Battle...

2507
01:46:44,700 --> 01:46:46,510
anytime,

2508
01:46:46,610 --> 01:46:48,170
so we always prepared ourselves for it.

2509
01:46:48,610 --> 01:46:51,140
We've shown similar moves in the past,

2510
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:53,080
so we'll prepare some new ones.

2511
01:46:54,150 --> 01:46:57,279
So that we can enter the finals and get good results,

2512
01:46:57,280 --> 01:46:59,650
we'll do our best and win.

2513
01:47:01,090 --> 01:47:03,590
It's so much fun to wear this and enter a battle.

2514
01:47:04,420 --> 01:47:07,460
I brought my outfit from Season One since I really wanted to win.

2515
01:47:07,660 --> 01:47:09,489
(The outfit that brought her victory when she entered...)

2516
01:47:09,490 --> 01:47:11,330
(Battle with the Weakest Dancer in Season 1.)

2517
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:13,430
I really want to do well today.

2518
01:47:15,700 --> 01:47:17,500
Dad, I'm having the Elimination Battle today.

2519
01:47:17,740 --> 01:47:19,339
(Squeezing)

2520
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:20,470
I'll do well.

2521
01:47:21,770 --> 01:47:23,309
I really miss my mom and dad.

2522
01:47:23,310 --> 01:47:26,550
Even if I must see them after the finals,

2523
01:47:26,650 --> 01:47:28,750
I won't go home today.

2524
01:47:29,250 --> 01:47:31,080
All right. I'm going to play the music.

2525
01:47:31,420 --> 01:47:36,189
I'm feeling very centered and grounded.

2526
01:47:36,190 --> 01:47:38,959
Just like, getting prepped and ready with the team...

2527
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:41,959
that I can incorporate if I have to go out...

2528
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:45,429
We would just prepare more in order to try and win this battle.

2529
01:47:45,430 --> 01:47:48,929
It just reminded me of why MOTIV deserves...

2530
01:47:48,930 --> 01:47:50,099
that spot in the finals.

2531
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:53,340
Because I do feel that we are one of the strongest teams...

2532
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:56,370
in this season of World of Street Woman Fighter.

2533
01:47:57,940 --> 01:47:59,580
(Elimination Battle BUMSUP versus MOTIV)

2534
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:01,379
(The Elimination Battle will seal BUMSUP and MOTIV's fate.)

2535
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:03,280
(I would be able to easily beat them.)

2536
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:04,619
(I don't want to go home.)

2537
01:48:04,620 --> 01:48:07,249
(The only real battler they have is Lip J.)

2538
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:09,250
(I feel really confident in battling BUMSUP.)

2539
01:48:09,820 --> 01:48:11,060
(Oh, my gosh.)

2540
01:48:11,390 --> 01:48:12,989
(The last Elimination Battle for the finals)

2541
01:48:12,990 --> 01:48:15,289
(I really want to enter the finals with my members.)

2542
01:48:15,290 --> 01:48:16,900
(I don't want to go home.)

2543
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:19,999
(The third crew to get eliminated is...)

2544
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,299
(Soon)

2545
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:23,469
(The Global Public Early Voting...)

2546
01:48:23,470 --> 01:48:26,499
(for the Final Crew Cheer Theme will begin.)

2547
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:29,639
(The full version of each crew's cheer theme will be...)

2548
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:32,109
(the Final Crew Cheer Theme Performance)

2549
01:48:32,110 --> 01:48:35,049
(For the final winner of World of Street Fighter, )

2550
01:48:35,050 --> 01:48:36,950
(please participate in the early voting.)

2551
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:40,720
(The final step toward the finals)

2552
01:48:41,090 --> 01:48:42,530
(The crews' fate will be decided...)

2553
01:48:42,850 --> 01:48:45,190
(in the Elimination Battle.)

2554
01:48:47,230 --> 01:48:48,230
(Elimination Battle)

2555
01:48:48,290 --> 01:48:50,660
(The last Elimination Battle of WSWF)

2556
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:53,030
(Elimination Battle)

2557
01:48:53,930 --> 01:48:55,800
(Full of cheers)

2558
01:48:56,170 --> 01:48:57,400
Hello, everyone.

2559
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:58,946
(Emcee Sung Han Bin enters.)

2560
01:48:58,970 --> 01:49:01,169
(It's good to see you.)

2561
01:49:01,170 --> 01:49:02,539
(Bowing)

2562
01:49:02,540 --> 01:49:03,540
(Screaming)

2563
01:49:03,541 --> 01:49:05,540
(His face is so small!)

2564
01:49:06,850 --> 01:49:08,979
The pride of charismatic women around the world...

2565
01:49:08,980 --> 01:49:10,319
is on the line in this global dance competition.

2566
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:12,449
The journey of World of Street Woman Fighter...

2567
01:49:12,450 --> 01:49:15,520
is about to reach the finals.

2568
01:49:15,820 --> 01:49:17,290
(Already?)

2569
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:21,729
Today, one crew will say their final goodbyes...

2570
01:49:21,730 --> 01:49:24,430
without entering the finals.

2571
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:27,830
(I don't like eliminations.)

2572
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:29,800
I really want to advance to the finals.

2573
01:49:30,070 --> 01:49:31,600
We have to win no matter what.

2574
01:49:32,270 --> 01:49:33,790
We're going to have to send them home.

2575
01:49:33,940 --> 01:49:36,070
We can get this win so easily.

2576
01:49:37,110 --> 01:49:39,539
I'll introduce the special judges...

2577
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:41,680
who will judge the two crews' battle.

2578
01:49:42,050 --> 01:49:43,150
(Expectant)

2579
01:49:43,350 --> 01:49:45,079
- I wonder who it is. - Let's go.

2580
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:49,190
She's a world-class choreographer who created many hit dance routines.

2581
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:53,090
She's the leader of 1MILLION, a global dance crew.

2582
01:49:53,490 --> 01:49:55,930
Lia Kim!

2583
01:49:57,060 --> 01:50:00,300
(Special judge, Lia Kim)

2584
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:01,830
Hey!

2585
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:05,440
(Harimu of 1MILLION)

2586
01:50:05,670 --> 01:50:07,539
(She can move her body...)

2587
01:50:07,540 --> 01:50:09,610
(freely.)

2588
01:50:09,710 --> 01:50:11,240
(Dancing)

2589
01:50:20,350 --> 01:50:21,350
(Thank you.)

2590
01:50:21,351 --> 01:50:22,820
(She nailed it.)

2591
01:50:23,220 --> 01:50:24,220
She's cool.

2592
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:25,520
Period!

2593
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:27,829
It's the dancer who commanded the global stage...

2594
01:50:27,830 --> 01:50:30,529
with the performances that got the world's attention.

2595
01:50:30,530 --> 01:50:31,699
He's a legendary dancer...

2596
01:50:31,700 --> 01:50:34,900
who represents the Japanese street scene.

2597
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:36,800
It's KITE!

2598
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:40,410
KITE is on the show today.

2599
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:43,840
(Special judge, KITE)

2600
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:46,780
(KITE?)

2601
01:50:48,110 --> 01:50:50,819
(He took over the battle scene with his popping moves.)

2602
01:50:50,820 --> 01:50:55,120
(The living history of the Japanese street scene, KITE)

2603
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:03,260
(Fancy moves)

2604
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:07,000
KITE!

2605
01:51:13,770 --> 01:51:16,009
(His control is insane!)

2606
01:51:16,010 --> 01:51:17,440
(Impressed)

2607
01:51:18,980 --> 01:51:20,410
(Satisfied)

2608
01:51:22,350 --> 01:51:23,450
Battlers.

2609
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:27,689
It's an unrivaled performer who draws attention...

2610
01:51:27,690 --> 01:51:29,590
with a single move.

2611
01:51:30,290 --> 01:51:32,389
He's the living legend who's acknowledged...

2612
01:51:32,390 --> 01:51:33,930
by the popping scene around the world.

2613
01:51:34,660 --> 01:51:37,699
He's Poppin'C!

2614
01:51:37,700 --> 01:51:39,300
(Special judge, Poppin'C)

2615
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:40,730
Poppin'C!

2616
01:51:42,700 --> 01:51:44,170
A popper!

2617
01:51:44,970 --> 01:51:49,240
(He moves his body freely with perfect control.)

2618
01:51:49,610 --> 01:51:53,109
(He's the popping master who's at the top of the world.)

2619
01:51:53,110 --> 01:51:55,810
(The strongest battler, Poppin'C)

2620
01:52:02,290 --> 01:52:04,090
(Junna dances.)

2621
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:08,800
(With his details, he doesn't miss a single rhythm.)

2622
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:13,400
(Powerful popping)

2623
01:52:15,870 --> 01:52:17,370
(Goosebumps)

2624
01:52:21,740 --> 01:52:23,270
(I have so much respect!)

2625
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:26,040
Good judges.

2626
01:52:27,110 --> 01:52:30,149
Now, we'll begin the third Elimination Battle...

2627
01:52:30,150 --> 01:52:33,020
of World of Street Woman Fighter.

2628
01:52:33,450 --> 01:52:37,320
It's one battle away from the finals.

2629
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:39,889
Which crew will get eliminated...

2630
01:52:39,890 --> 01:52:42,859
and unfortunately conclude their journey...

2631
01:52:42,860 --> 01:52:45,560
on World of Street Woman Fighter today?

2632
01:52:46,060 --> 01:52:48,800
The first elimination candidate is...

2633
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:51,170
Team Korea,

2634
01:52:52,670 --> 01:52:54,270
BUMSUP.

2635
01:52:54,470 --> 01:52:56,269
("Mek it Bums Up!," produced by THE HUB)

2636
01:52:56,270 --> 01:52:58,010
(No way)

2637
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:04,479
(BUMSUP enters.)

2638
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:07,020
(Cheering)

2639
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:10,290
Let's go, BUMSUP.

2640
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:12,989
We'll think of this as our last chance...

2641
01:53:12,990 --> 01:53:14,660
and give it our all.

2642
01:53:15,260 --> 01:53:16,830
We need to win no matter what.

2643
01:53:17,430 --> 01:53:18,960
Good luck!

2644
01:53:20,270 --> 01:53:21,530
(Let's go.)

2645
01:53:21,570 --> 01:53:23,250
I really hope that everyone will cheer up.

2646
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:28,109
The second elimination candidate...

2647
01:53:28,110 --> 01:53:30,240
that will enter the final battle against BUMSUP is...

2648
01:53:30,780 --> 01:53:32,610
Team USA,

2649
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:35,250
MOTIV.

2650
01:53:36,150 --> 01:53:37,919
(Someone save Team Orange.)

2651
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:39,849
(Impossible)

2652
01:53:39,850 --> 01:53:42,889
("What's Your Motiv?," produced by THE HUB)

2653
01:53:42,890 --> 01:53:47,130
(MOTIV enters.)

2654
01:53:51,330 --> 01:53:52,960
(Let's go.)

2655
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:54,170
Let's go, MOTIV.

2656
01:53:55,770 --> 01:53:58,200
It's going to be hard for them to beat us.

2657
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:01,439
We're kind of used to battling,

2658
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:03,540
so we feel confident.

2659
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:06,340
Just rip it off at this point.

2660
01:54:06,380 --> 01:54:08,110
I know how scary this is.

2661
01:54:09,550 --> 01:54:13,079
This is the battle for the one last spot in the finals.

2662
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:15,520
Are you confident about advancing to the finals?

2663
01:54:16,450 --> 01:54:17,890
We must go no matter what.

2664
01:54:19,890 --> 01:54:22,659
This is a battle for survival.

2665
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:24,560
I won't go home today.

2666
01:54:25,230 --> 01:54:26,230
Goodbye.

2667
01:54:26,830 --> 01:54:29,230
Team Korea's atmosphere suddenly changed.

2668
01:54:30,570 --> 01:54:33,640
MOTIV has proved that they're strong at everything in this competition,

2669
01:54:34,510 --> 01:54:37,110
so I can't wait to be strong at battling.

2670
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:40,549
I think MOTIV well deserves to be in the finals.

2671
01:54:40,550 --> 01:54:42,550
(Not a chance)

2672
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:44,380
Even though I love BUMSUP...

2673
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:46,450
MOTIV.

2674
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:48,690
It's going to be fun.

2675
01:54:49,190 --> 01:54:52,359
The formal of the Elimination Battle will be the best out of five.

2676
01:54:52,360 --> 01:54:56,529
The crew to take the 1st 3 wins will solidify their survival.

2677
01:54:56,530 --> 01:54:58,830
The battle will end right then and there.

2678
01:54:59,530 --> 01:55:00,730
This is driving me crazy.

2679
01:55:01,330 --> 01:55:02,370
Okay. Wake it up.

2680
01:55:03,230 --> 01:55:05,070
Fantaye can still go out.

2681
01:55:05,170 --> 01:55:06,740
Will Logan and Lip J go first?

2682
01:55:07,540 --> 01:55:09,839
We've seen your performance enough,

2683
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:13,180
so you have to show us something out of the box, something new.

2684
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:15,650
Then you'll grab our attention.

2685
01:55:16,810 --> 01:55:19,349
When I judge, I don't want to remain sitting.

2686
01:55:19,350 --> 01:55:22,250
I want to see a great battle...

2687
01:55:22,490 --> 01:55:25,020
that'll make every judge stand up...

2688
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:27,690
and jump off this platform.

2689
01:55:27,890 --> 01:55:30,630
Show me that you want to go to this final round, please.

2690
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,700
Burn the stage and give me the goosebumps.

2691
01:55:34,870 --> 01:55:37,770
The two crews that inspired me the most...

2692
01:55:38,100 --> 01:55:40,740
in the Mega Crew Mission...

2693
01:55:42,240 --> 01:55:44,710
have met for the battle.

2694
01:55:45,140 --> 01:55:50,050
As a judge, the way I can respect you guys the most...

2695
01:55:50,380 --> 01:55:52,919
is judging fairly.

2696
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:54,820
I'll judge properly.

2697
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:00,960
There's an aura.

2698
01:56:01,090 --> 01:56:03,290
They are proper street dance judges.

2699
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:07,369
Now, it's time to determine the third crew...

2700
01:56:07,370 --> 01:56:10,670
that will get eliminated on World of Street Woman Fighter.

2701
01:56:12,470 --> 01:56:15,010
Round One of the battle is...

2702
01:56:15,240 --> 01:56:16,769
the Group Battle.

2703
01:56:16,770 --> 01:56:18,610
(Round 1 of BUMSUP versus MOTIV, Group Battle)

2704
01:56:18,710 --> 01:56:22,050
The order will be decided by spinning a water bottle.

2705
01:56:22,710 --> 01:56:24,180
(Okay. Let's do this!)

2706
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:25,720
It's better to go first.

2707
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:29,019
(Which crew will go first for the Group Battle?)

2708
01:56:29,020 --> 01:56:30,419
(BUMSUP goes 1st for Round 1.)

2709
01:56:30,420 --> 01:56:33,089
- Okay. - Okay.

2710
01:56:33,090 --> 01:56:34,629
- Let's go. - BUMSUP will go first.

2711
01:56:34,630 --> 01:56:36,329
MOTIV will go second.

2712
01:56:36,330 --> 01:56:37,560
(MOTIV goes second.)

2713
01:56:38,600 --> 01:56:40,700
I'm feeling confident.

2714
01:56:40,830 --> 01:56:43,399
I'm not very afraid of what they can do.

2715
01:56:43,400 --> 01:56:47,309
I feel that it'll be pretty easy to beat them...

2716
01:56:47,310 --> 01:56:49,409
because we've beaten them before...

2717
01:56:49,410 --> 01:56:52,410
in this very same type of battle, a group battle.

2718
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:55,079
(MOTIV beat BUMSUP with a score of 3 to 0...)

2719
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:57,379
(in the No Respect World Battle.)

2720
01:56:57,380 --> 01:56:58,520
And a 1-on-1 Battle.

2721
01:56:59,780 --> 01:57:02,050
Logistx has already taken a win.

2722
01:57:02,420 --> 01:57:04,520
Marlee has already taken a win.

2723
01:57:04,620 --> 01:57:06,619
(MOTIV has won every battle against BUMSUP in the past.)

2724
01:57:06,620 --> 01:57:09,789
It's really going to be different from No Respect World Battle.

2725
01:57:09,790 --> 01:57:11,329
Let's show them how much we've grown...

2726
01:57:11,330 --> 01:57:13,560
- and become one. - BUMSUP!

2727
01:57:14,030 --> 01:57:15,400
We'll do this as one team.

2728
01:57:15,970 --> 01:57:17,739
- With the tiger's spirit, BUMSUP! - With the tiger's spirit, BUMSUP!

2729
01:57:17,740 --> 01:57:19,239
(The tiger's spirit is fully charged.)

2730
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:21,710
This time, we need to win no matter what.

2731
01:57:23,240 --> 01:57:25,379
Whoever prepared something crazy will win.

2732
01:57:25,380 --> 01:57:26,440
For sure.

2733
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:28,479
BUMSUP versus MOTIV.

2734
01:57:28,480 --> 01:57:30,279
MOTIV versus BUMSUP.

2735
01:57:30,280 --> 01:57:32,450
The fateful Group Battle...

2736
01:57:33,550 --> 01:57:36,220
- will begin now. - Let's go!

2737
01:57:36,790 --> 01:57:37,960
Are you guys ready?

2738
01:57:39,220 --> 01:57:40,220
Fight!

2739
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:42,829
(Round 1 Group Battle, BUMSUP goes 1st.)

2740
01:57:42,830 --> 01:57:44,559
They'll have no expectations.

2741
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:47,100
They'll think that we'll get intimidated.

2742
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:49,230
But it won't happen. We'll show you guys.

2743
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:55,670
They were showcasing hip-hop, which took me by surprise.

2744
01:57:57,180 --> 01:57:58,780
You didn't expect this, did you?

2745
01:57:59,580 --> 01:58:02,380
I thought that was smart, but I wasn't intimidated.

2746
01:58:03,510 --> 01:58:04,520
We'll show them.

2747
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:14,360
(How about now?)

2748
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:17,090
I like this move.

2749
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:18,260
Come on!

2750
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:20,969
(Let's go, BUMSUP.)

2751
01:58:20,970 --> 01:58:22,029
(Where are you going, BUMSUP?)

2752
01:58:22,030 --> 01:58:24,300
(To the audience)

2753
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:26,700
They just embodied a fun vibe.

2754
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:29,840
I think it was a little annoying, but that moment was cool.

2755
01:58:31,180 --> 01:58:34,109
MOTIV knows how to have fun and enjoy themselves.

2756
01:58:34,110 --> 01:58:36,050
We'll show them that we can have fun too.

2757
01:58:36,550 --> 01:58:38,680
(They compete with their relaxed vibe.)

2758
01:58:39,150 --> 01:58:41,120
(Monika runs.)

2759
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:42,420
(My heart is running too.)

2760
01:58:42,650 --> 01:58:43,650
That's crazy.

2761
01:58:44,090 --> 01:58:46,390
She was mocking our Mega Crew Mission.

2762
01:58:46,990 --> 01:58:48,759
Fantaye did it,

2763
01:58:48,760 --> 01:58:50,500
but that run was Monika's.

2764
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:56,630
Countdown! Five, four, three, two, one.

2765
01:58:56,700 --> 01:58:57,700
Switch!

2766
01:58:59,270 --> 01:59:02,110
We did well. We had a great synergy.

2767
01:59:02,540 --> 01:59:04,810
We wanted to press them with our performance.

2768
01:59:05,810 --> 01:59:07,549
I honestly didn't feel anything.

2769
01:59:07,550 --> 01:59:10,109
It was a poor-quality movement.

2770
01:59:10,110 --> 01:59:12,150
Come on, MOTIV!

2771
01:59:12,380 --> 01:59:13,380
(Round 1 Group Battle, MOTIV goes 2nd.)

2772
01:59:13,381 --> 01:59:14,419
Let's go!

2773
01:59:14,420 --> 01:59:15,790
It's going to be an easy win.

2774
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:18,719
(BUMSUP will cry.)

2775
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:19,789
(OSAKA Ojo Gang?)

2776
01:59:19,790 --> 01:59:20,829
(Oh, no!)

2777
01:59:20,830 --> 01:59:22,136
(Why are you bringing us into this?)

2778
01:59:22,160 --> 01:59:23,589
(We can throw it back too.)

2779
01:59:23,590 --> 01:59:25,876
(Being on the combat mode, MOTIV throws shade at all crews.)

2780
01:59:25,900 --> 01:59:26,900
Why do that?

2781
01:59:26,901 --> 01:59:29,221
It looked like they added it since they had nothing to do.

2782
01:59:30,770 --> 01:59:33,799
We were attacking BUMSUP, OSAKA Ojo Gang,

2783
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:35,470
and then AG SQUAD...

2784
01:59:35,970 --> 01:59:38,010
just to let everyone know...

2785
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:40,210
that we were ready to take you on and beat you.

2786
01:59:40,580 --> 01:59:41,580
(Goosebumps)

2787
01:59:47,450 --> 01:59:48,810
(The return of Kaidi as Saweetie.)

2788
01:59:48,950 --> 01:59:50,760
As expected, they gave a fun performance.

2789
01:59:51,460 --> 01:59:53,890
But it wasn't intimidating at all.

2790
01:59:54,060 --> 01:59:55,620
We definitely have a chance of winning.

2791
01:59:58,860 --> 02:00:00,700
(A powerful combo)

2792
02:00:01,130 --> 02:00:02,670
(Logistx's signature skill...)

2793
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,100
(with the perfect teamwork)

2794
02:00:06,300 --> 02:00:07,310
Oh, yes!

2795
02:00:08,270 --> 02:00:10,879
We just wanted to intimidate them.

2796
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:12,340
I think we did a good job on that.

2797
02:00:13,310 --> 02:00:14,350
That was lit.

2798
02:00:15,480 --> 02:00:16,809
Oh, my gosh.

2799
02:00:16,810 --> 02:00:22,189
Countdown! Five, four, three, two, one.

2800
02:00:22,190 --> 02:00:24,560
Battle over.

2801
02:00:25,120 --> 02:00:26,790
(One last shot)

2802
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:32,060
All right!

2803
02:00:32,360 --> 02:00:34,200
(His jaw drops.)

2804
02:00:35,070 --> 02:00:36,229
That was fire.

2805
02:00:36,230 --> 02:00:37,400
Fire.

2806
02:00:37,570 --> 02:00:40,500
- I like this. - What?

2807
02:00:40,740 --> 02:00:41,740
One more!

2808
02:00:42,770 --> 02:00:44,709
I was getting scared for MOTIV a little bit.

2809
02:00:44,710 --> 02:00:46,839
I was like, "How's MOTIV going to come back?"

2810
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:48,349
- And then I was, - Yes.

2811
02:00:48,350 --> 02:00:49,980
"I'll never doubt MOTIV."

2812
02:00:50,580 --> 02:00:51,920
That was a very nice battle.

2813
02:00:52,580 --> 02:00:54,320
Isn't this a really nice battle?

2814
02:00:55,820 --> 02:00:57,836
(It was such a good battle that they want to keep watching!)

2815
02:00:57,860 --> 02:01:00,390
Aaliyah. What did you think of the battle you just saw?

2816
02:01:01,530 --> 02:01:02,629
It's a tricky one...

2817
02:01:02,630 --> 02:01:05,130
because they both had a reference of different crews.

2818
02:01:05,830 --> 02:01:06,830
It's a tricky one.

2819
02:01:06,831 --> 02:01:08,446
(They can't predict the result of the battle.)

2820
02:01:08,470 --> 02:01:10,569
(What did the fight judges think?)

2821
02:01:10,570 --> 02:01:12,700
Fight judge, Lia Kim.

2822
02:01:12,770 --> 02:01:15,240
What did you think of Round One's Group Battle?

2823
02:01:15,710 --> 02:01:18,439
Perhaps, because this battle is the last chance of survival,

2824
02:01:18,440 --> 02:01:22,680
both teams showed a very strong performance.

2825
02:01:22,810 --> 02:01:25,379
I felt like both teams...

2826
02:01:25,380 --> 02:01:28,820
had similar flows.

2827
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:30,919
There was a group performance.

2828
02:01:30,920 --> 02:01:33,319
Then one member jumped out...

2829
02:01:33,320 --> 02:01:36,059
and showed a unique move.

2830
02:01:36,060 --> 02:01:38,959
In terms of composition, the performances were similar.

2831
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:41,699
Within that, I chose the crew...

2832
02:01:41,700 --> 02:01:45,640
that had more originality and cleanliness in their moves.

2833
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,770
I really enjoyed the battle.

2834
02:01:47,870 --> 02:01:49,310
(Thank you.)

2835
02:01:50,510 --> 02:01:56,610
MOTIV prepared a performance that really suited the battle.

2836
02:01:56,850 --> 02:02:00,819
They were like a trained army unit or special forces.

2837
02:02:00,820 --> 02:02:03,919
BUMSUP broke free from the boundaries of the battle...

2838
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:06,489
and went, "Let's give a performance that's new and original."

2839
02:02:06,490 --> 02:02:07,789
"It'll either be a hit or a miss."

2840
02:02:07,790 --> 02:02:11,229
Both teams had great energy and ideas.

2841
02:02:11,230 --> 02:02:12,530
Even the teamwork was perfect.

2842
02:02:12,830 --> 02:02:14,190
I really enjoyed the performances.

2843
02:02:17,700 --> 02:02:20,200
Girls, you were on fire.

2844
02:02:20,340 --> 02:02:22,839
Thank you.

2845
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:25,240
I liked the vibe of both teams.

2846
02:02:25,540 --> 02:02:27,379
It was hard to make a decision,

2847
02:02:27,380 --> 02:02:30,180
but I'm happy to be judging you guys. Thank you.

2848
02:02:33,780 --> 02:02:36,119
The first round seizes control.

2849
02:02:36,120 --> 02:02:38,080
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't hoping for a win.

2850
02:02:38,220 --> 02:02:41,590
But I honestly don't know who it's going to go to.

2851
02:02:42,060 --> 02:02:44,759
I know we killed it. I'm feeling hopeful,

2852
02:02:44,760 --> 02:02:46,030
but it's a blur.

2853
02:02:46,630 --> 02:02:48,900
For the first result of the battle,

2854
02:02:48,970 --> 02:02:51,970
the cards will be opened at the same time.

2855
02:02:52,340 --> 02:02:53,460
(Will it happen right away?)

2856
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:55,600
(The last Elimination Battle for the crews' fate)

2857
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:57,340
Fight Judges,

2858
02:02:58,010 --> 02:02:59,880
open your cards.

2859
02:03:00,910 --> 02:03:02,550
Please.

2860
02:03:03,350 --> 02:03:04,520
We need to win.

2861
02:03:05,380 --> 02:03:07,049
You're all going to vote for MOTIV.

2862
02:03:07,050 --> 02:03:08,650
And MOTIV is going to win this.

2863
02:03:08,950 --> 02:03:11,060
This is hard. I can't watch it.

2864
02:03:11,260 --> 02:03:12,320
Oh, no.

2865
02:03:12,820 --> 02:03:15,860
(Which crew will take the first win?)

2866
02:03:22,130 --> 02:03:24,699
(MOTIV wins Round 1 Group Battle.)

2867
02:03:24,700 --> 02:03:26,400
With a score of 5 to 0,

2868
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:29,140
MOTIV won Round One.

2869
02:03:30,510 --> 02:03:31,909
(Oh, no.)

2870
02:03:31,910 --> 02:03:33,510
(No one expected a unanimous vote.)

2871
02:03:33,780 --> 02:03:35,849
We're getting started now.

2872
02:03:35,850 --> 02:03:38,479
We've got to keep it clean.

2873
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:41,389
It was unanimous for MOTIV.

2874
02:03:41,390 --> 02:03:43,189
I felt shocked, but grateful.

2875
02:03:43,190 --> 02:03:45,889
And then it gave me a boost of confidence...

2876
02:03:45,890 --> 02:03:47,730
leading into these next battles.

2877
02:03:50,660 --> 02:03:53,599
It was our goal to win the Group Battle no matter what.

2878
02:03:53,600 --> 02:03:55,529
Since that didn't happen,

2879
02:03:55,530 --> 02:03:56,829
we were like, "This is bad. What are we going to do?"

2880
02:03:56,830 --> 02:03:58,239
"No, I need to focus for now."

2881
02:03:58,240 --> 02:04:01,310
I switched back and forth between these emotions.

2882
02:04:02,110 --> 02:04:03,830
It's okay. We still have many rounds to go.

2883
02:04:05,240 --> 02:04:07,140
We lost, but we'll move on to the next rounds.

2884
02:04:08,050 --> 02:04:09,280
What's going on next?

2885
02:04:09,750 --> 02:04:11,879
(Will MOTIV keep up or will BUMSUP strike back?)

2886
02:04:11,880 --> 02:04:14,020
Next up is Round Two,

2887
02:04:14,220 --> 02:04:16,819
the 2-on-2 Duet Battle.

2888
02:04:16,820 --> 02:04:19,289
(Cheering)

2889
02:04:19,290 --> 02:04:20,990
Let's go!

2890
02:04:21,390 --> 02:04:23,629
Marlee, do you want to do this again?

2891
02:04:23,630 --> 02:04:24,730
Or just Logan?

2892
02:04:24,830 --> 02:04:26,660
I've got to see. I've got to see who goes...

2893
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:28,320
- Who's going to go first. - Yes.

2894
02:04:28,530 --> 02:04:29,630
We can do it.

2895
02:04:31,100 --> 02:04:34,440
We practiced so much for the 2-on-2 battle.

2896
02:04:35,240 --> 02:04:38,179
- The 2-on-2 battle? - Yes. Let's decide on the duo.

2897
02:04:38,180 --> 02:04:40,079
I think Purplow is the surefire way to win.

2898
02:04:40,080 --> 02:04:41,579
- Purplow will win. - It'll totally win.

2899
02:04:41,580 --> 02:04:43,449
- The teamwork is insane. - It has to happen.

2900
02:04:43,450 --> 02:04:45,179
For the 2-on-2 battle,

2901
02:04:45,180 --> 02:04:48,749
we decided to do what we used to do...

2902
02:04:48,750 --> 02:04:52,159
as members of Purplow.

2903
02:04:52,160 --> 02:04:55,029
Ri.hey and I took it as our priority...

2904
02:04:55,030 --> 02:04:56,989
and practiced a lot.

2905
02:04:56,990 --> 02:04:59,599
We prepared ourselves for the Afrobeat music...

2906
02:04:59,600 --> 02:05:01,630
and worked on our teamwork.

2907
02:05:04,100 --> 02:05:06,899
I feel like all of our duos are strong.

2908
02:05:06,900 --> 02:05:08,610
We can do most things.

2909
02:05:08,970 --> 02:05:09,970
Me and Bella?

2910
02:05:10,670 --> 02:05:11,679
Yes. You and Bella.

2911
02:05:11,680 --> 02:05:13,709
We felt like the smartest option...

2912
02:05:13,710 --> 02:05:16,980
would be to use the battles I had with Bella.

2913
02:05:17,080 --> 02:05:20,349
She knew that she and I would have the best go.

2914
02:05:20,350 --> 02:05:22,689
We are a good team in that way.

2915
02:05:22,690 --> 02:05:24,860
We were ready to take you on and beat you.

2916
02:05:25,790 --> 02:05:28,089
(Which crew will go 1st in Round 2?)

2917
02:05:28,090 --> 02:05:29,090
We're going first.

2918
02:05:29,230 --> 02:05:32,929
BUMSUP will go 1st, and MOTIV will go 2nd.

2919
02:05:32,930 --> 02:05:34,630
(Let's go.)

2920
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:35,900
Let's go.

2921
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:38,340
Just do it.

2922
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:40,039
- It doesn't matter. - It doesn't matter.

2923
02:05:40,040 --> 02:05:41,109
- Okay. - Period.

2924
02:05:41,110 --> 02:05:43,410
- It's just.. Period. Just go. - Okay.

2925
02:05:43,510 --> 02:05:46,840
The two crews' fate depends on this life-or-death battle.

2926
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:49,580
It starts now.

2927
02:05:49,880 --> 02:05:51,619
(Let's go.)

2928
02:05:51,620 --> 02:05:52,679
Good luck.

2929
02:05:52,680 --> 02:05:54,179
(Nervous)

2930
02:05:54,180 --> 02:05:56,649
- I hate this. - I know.

2931
02:05:56,650 --> 02:05:57,760
Okay.

2932
02:05:58,020 --> 02:06:00,120
I'm feeling very confident in us winning.

2933
02:06:00,390 --> 02:06:01,390
Okay.

2934
02:06:01,391 --> 02:06:02,859
We have to win this round.

2935
02:06:02,860 --> 02:06:03,890
Ready?

2936
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:05,400
Fight!

2937
02:06:05,401 --> 02:06:07,260
(BUMSUP goes first.)

2938
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:08,799
(Who will be the strongest duo from BUMSUP?)

2939
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:10,970
This round is ours.

2940
02:06:11,070 --> 02:06:12,470
Who's going to come out?

2941
02:06:13,300 --> 02:06:14,440
(Let's go.)

2942
02:06:15,140 --> 02:06:17,039
Let's go.

2943
02:06:17,040 --> 02:06:18,909
(For the Duet Battle, it's BUMSUP's Honey J and Ri.hey)

2944
02:06:18,910 --> 02:06:20,410
Let's go!

2945
02:06:20,510 --> 02:06:21,609
Afrobeat music began to play.

2946
02:06:21,610 --> 02:06:23,380
It was Honey J and Ri.hey's time.

2947
02:06:24,750 --> 02:06:26,680
I wasn't intimidated at all.

2948
02:06:26,920 --> 02:06:28,690
Honey J and Ri.hey.

2949
02:06:29,690 --> 02:06:31,520
It was Honey J and Ri.hey's time.

2950
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:33,860
(Dancing)

2951
02:06:36,090 --> 02:06:38,300
We'll show our cool sides.

2952
02:06:38,660 --> 02:06:39,700
It's okay.

2953
02:06:40,700 --> 02:06:41,730
Let's go!

2954
02:06:42,100 --> 02:06:43,200
We have a chance.

2955
02:06:43,900 --> 02:06:45,270
Hey! Let's go!

2956
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:48,640
(Perfect teamwork)

2957
02:06:49,070 --> 02:06:50,410
Honey J!

2958
02:06:52,180 --> 02:06:54,279
We decided to press them with our sharp performance.

2959
02:06:54,280 --> 02:06:55,280
(Surprised)

2960
02:07:00,920 --> 02:07:01,950
It was not good.

2961
02:07:02,190 --> 02:07:04,590
We wanted to show our techniques.

2962
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:10,329
They did really well.

2963
02:07:10,330 --> 02:07:11,600
It wasn't very clean.

2964
02:07:12,660 --> 02:07:14,830
Let's go, Ri.hey!

2965
02:07:15,570 --> 02:07:18,340
We had a good synergy, so we felt like we could win.

2966
02:07:19,240 --> 02:07:21,070
The chemistry, maybe, wasn't as good.

2967
02:07:25,140 --> 02:07:27,409
They're Purplow. They're bound to win.

2968
02:07:27,410 --> 02:07:28,710
(Impressed)

2969
02:07:32,680 --> 02:07:34,650
Overall, they weren't as clean.

2970
02:07:36,050 --> 02:07:37,490
We'll definitely win.

2971
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:39,560
Switch!

2972
02:07:39,561 --> 02:07:41,089
(MOTIV goes second.)

2973
02:07:41,090 --> 02:07:42,289
Who's next?

2974
02:07:42,290 --> 02:07:43,430
(Who will it be?)

2975
02:07:44,660 --> 02:07:47,600
Marlee and I came out. We are a good team.

2976
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,170
Let's see who wins.

2977
02:07:50,300 --> 02:07:51,400
They're good.

2978
02:07:52,570 --> 02:07:53,670
I'm super confident.

2979
02:07:55,310 --> 02:07:57,880
We have the best members, so there's no pressure.

2980
02:07:58,380 --> 02:07:59,540
All right, then. Let's do it.

2981
02:08:00,440 --> 02:08:01,980
Hey.

2982
02:08:03,110 --> 02:08:04,580
(Falling for them)

2983
02:08:08,390 --> 02:08:10,620
It felt clean. It felt fun.

2984
02:08:10,720 --> 02:08:13,290
It was MOTIV's usual style.

2985
02:08:17,330 --> 02:08:18,560
(Focusing)

2986
02:08:22,930 --> 02:08:24,540
I just thoroughly enjoyed myself.

2987
02:08:30,810 --> 02:08:32,739
I really liked that piece of choreography.

2988
02:08:32,740 --> 02:08:34,340
It wasn't that pressuring.

2989
02:08:38,650 --> 02:08:40,320
(Immersing)

2990
02:08:42,050 --> 02:08:45,519
- Countdown. Five, four, three, - They had a few seconds left.

2991
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:48,260
- two, one. Battle... - That'd deduct their points.

2992
02:08:49,090 --> 02:08:50,529
I think we can take it.

2993
02:08:50,530 --> 02:08:52,400
Battle over.

2994
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,399
(Applauding)

2995
02:08:55,400 --> 02:08:58,369
We won.

2996
02:08:58,370 --> 02:08:59,699
(Good job.)

2997
02:08:59,700 --> 02:09:03,239
To perform on that stage with that much intensity was super fun.

2998
02:09:03,240 --> 02:09:05,279
(So cool)

2999
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:07,380
It's BUMSUP for sure.

3000
02:09:08,910 --> 02:09:10,380
- I just like MOTIV. - Talk it.

3001
02:09:11,650 --> 02:09:13,319
- Not bad. - Not bad.

3002
02:09:13,320 --> 02:09:14,420
- Not bad. - Yes.

3003
02:09:15,020 --> 02:09:17,220
When would we get to watch them dancing together again?

3004
02:09:17,650 --> 02:09:19,459
- So we must stay like this. - Yes.

3005
02:09:19,460 --> 02:09:21,630
- Let's... - Yes, Purplow.

3006
02:09:21,730 --> 02:09:22,730
- We were different. - Of course.
Because this was like...

3007
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:25,800
Too fast.

3008
02:09:25,801 --> 02:09:27,321
And then we could've done this, but...

3009
02:09:27,730 --> 02:09:29,200
Save it for the next round. Yes.

3010
02:09:29,530 --> 02:09:30,530
That was great.

3011
02:09:30,531 --> 02:09:32,000
It was a good contrast.

3012
02:09:32,570 --> 02:09:35,569
They gave, "Let's just have fun." That's what MOTIV gave.

3013
02:09:35,570 --> 02:09:38,179
BUMSUP gave, "We're going to come and get you."

3014
02:09:38,180 --> 02:09:39,979
Actually, it felt head to head, though.

3015
02:09:39,980 --> 02:09:40,980
Okay.

3016
02:09:40,981 --> 02:09:42,249
I really hope we win this.

3017
02:09:42,250 --> 02:09:46,049
Since we lost the first battle, we had to win.

3018
02:09:46,050 --> 02:09:47,890
Okay.

3019
02:09:48,190 --> 02:09:49,420
I think we took that.

3020
02:09:50,190 --> 02:09:51,289
Well...

3021
02:09:51,290 --> 02:09:52,489
It was wonderful.

3022
02:09:52,490 --> 02:09:55,389
I liked how you tested each other's power.

3023
02:09:55,390 --> 02:09:58,829
What determined the result was...

3024
02:09:58,830 --> 02:10:03,469
which crew took the flow of the music...

3025
02:10:03,470 --> 02:10:08,570
and used the power to express the dance.

3026
02:10:11,410 --> 02:10:13,909
I barely had a clear winner for this.

3027
02:10:13,910 --> 02:10:15,679
I felt like it was so close because...

3028
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:17,649
the contrast and styles...

3029
02:10:17,650 --> 02:10:20,479
and the energy that were brought to these rounds...

3030
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:22,120
inched over the win for me.

3031
02:10:22,690 --> 02:10:25,720
(Which crew won Round 2?)

3032
02:10:26,020 --> 02:10:28,760
Or MOTIV. BUMSUP.

3033
02:10:29,990 --> 02:10:31,830
I was honestly feeling hopeful.

3034
02:10:33,030 --> 02:10:34,130
We must win.

3035
02:10:34,870 --> 02:10:37,070
Fight judges, open...

3036
02:10:38,100 --> 02:10:39,170
Let's go.

3037
02:10:39,700 --> 02:10:41,640
- Please. - Open your cards.

3038
02:10:45,480 --> 02:10:48,110
(BUMSUP wins Round 2 Duet Battle.)

3039
02:10:48,350 --> 02:10:50,680
(Nodding)

3040
02:10:50,780 --> 02:10:52,450
(Elimination Battle)

3041
02:10:53,420 --> 02:10:54,990
With a score of 5 to 0,

3042
02:10:55,620 --> 02:10:58,190
BUMSUP won Round Two.

3043
02:10:59,220 --> 02:11:01,589
- Yes. - Yes.

3044
02:11:01,590 --> 02:11:03,029
I told you we won!

3045
02:11:03,030 --> 02:11:05,100
- Okay. - It's only the beginning.

3046
02:11:05,530 --> 02:11:07,159
- BUMSUP - Thank you.

3047
02:11:07,160 --> 02:11:09,070
(Let's go.)

3048
02:11:11,700 --> 02:11:13,539
We won by 5 to 0.

3049
02:11:13,540 --> 02:11:14,540
It's such a relief.

3050
02:11:14,640 --> 02:11:16,210
We can start over.

3051
02:11:16,470 --> 02:11:18,979
(Respect)

3052
02:11:18,980 --> 02:11:19,980
(Approved)

3053
02:11:22,310 --> 02:11:23,450
(It's okay.)

3054
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:25,119
Good job.

3055
02:11:25,120 --> 02:11:26,120
We're the...

3056
02:11:26,121 --> 02:11:27,149
(Patting)

3057
02:11:27,150 --> 02:11:29,350
I feel like we're strong.

3058
02:11:29,450 --> 02:11:30,820
Maintain composure.

3059
02:11:31,590 --> 02:11:32,859
Honey J. You're so cool.

3060
02:11:32,860 --> 02:11:34,889
(Good luck.)

3061
02:11:34,890 --> 02:11:35,890
Thank you.

3062
02:11:36,260 --> 02:11:39,959
A lot of people rooted for us. It really cheered me up.

3063
02:11:39,960 --> 02:11:42,129
Now, the score is 1 to 1.

3064
02:11:42,130 --> 02:11:43,870
I'll have to give my all.

3065
02:11:44,270 --> 02:11:45,570
Now, they are tied.

3066
02:11:45,670 --> 02:11:46,770
- Yes. - Yes.

3067
02:11:46,940 --> 02:11:48,969
In the flow of the Elimination Battle...

3068
02:11:48,970 --> 02:11:51,309
where you can never be off-guard for a second,

3069
02:11:51,310 --> 02:11:52,340
Round Three is...

3070
02:11:52,840 --> 02:11:54,909
the 1-on-1 Battle.

3071
02:11:54,910 --> 02:11:56,280
(Expectant)

3072
02:11:56,450 --> 02:11:58,090
- One-on-one battle. - One-on-one battle.

3073
02:11:58,220 --> 02:11:59,379
It's Logan, obviously.

3074
02:11:59,380 --> 02:12:01,389
- I still think you should do it. - She's like a strong like...

3075
02:12:01,390 --> 02:12:03,320
I'm being so serious. You should do it.

3076
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:05,789
Don't forget how amazing you are.

3077
02:12:05,790 --> 02:12:08,430
I think it's time to pull Logan.

3078
02:12:08,530 --> 02:12:09,789
Versatile enough...

3079
02:12:09,790 --> 02:12:12,900
to be able to kill it to any track.

3080
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:16,170
I'm a stronger battler. Good strategy to win.

3081
02:12:16,470 --> 02:12:18,300
Oh, I think I know who's going.

3082
02:12:18,500 --> 02:12:20,299
Lip J's definitely coming out.

3083
02:12:20,300 --> 02:12:22,469
So Lip J's probably ready to take Logan.

3084
02:12:22,470 --> 02:12:24,569
I thought Lip J should do the 1-on-1 Battle...

3085
02:12:24,570 --> 02:12:26,979
since she had a lot of experience.

3086
02:12:26,980 --> 02:12:28,180
Because we must win.

3087
02:12:28,650 --> 02:12:32,079
I watched a lot of Logan's videos.

3088
02:12:32,080 --> 02:12:33,080
(Feeling reliable)

3089
02:12:33,081 --> 02:12:34,721
- I had a feeling we'd battle. - You did.

3090
02:12:35,350 --> 02:12:37,189
At the time, I wanted to play along...

3091
02:12:37,190 --> 02:12:40,389
and create the performance together.

3092
02:12:40,390 --> 02:12:41,630
But this time, I must win.

3093
02:12:41,730 --> 02:12:43,529
I must bring the win to the team.

3094
02:12:43,530 --> 02:12:44,730
I'm going to do my best.

3095
02:12:44,930 --> 02:12:47,959
I must win this individual round.

3096
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:50,130
This is a rematch between me and Lip J.

3097
02:12:50,470 --> 02:12:52,140
I'm going to have to soak her.

3098
02:12:52,340 --> 02:12:53,470
Show me what you got.

3099
02:12:53,940 --> 02:12:56,710
We'll spin the bottle to decide who goes first.

3100
02:12:58,440 --> 02:12:59,779
(And?)

3101
02:12:59,780 --> 02:13:01,110
(Please)

3102
02:13:01,810 --> 02:13:04,010
In Round Three, MOTIV will go first,

3103
02:13:04,210 --> 02:13:05,680
and BUMSUP will go second.

3104
02:13:05,950 --> 02:13:07,619
We have a chance.

3105
02:13:07,620 --> 02:13:08,650
You can do it.

3106
02:13:09,150 --> 02:13:10,620
Unleash the beast.

3107
02:13:10,720 --> 02:13:11,860
Come on, Olympian.

3108
02:13:12,060 --> 02:13:14,590
Let's begin the 1-on-1 Battle.

3109
02:13:14,690 --> 02:13:15,889
(Expectant)

3110
02:13:15,890 --> 02:13:17,260
You guys ready?

3111
02:13:18,330 --> 02:13:19,359
Fight.

3112
02:13:19,360 --> 02:13:20,759
(Intrigued)

3113
02:13:20,760 --> 02:13:22,069
(Round 3 1-on-1 Battle, MOTIV goes first.)

3114
02:13:22,070 --> 02:13:23,669
You're going to be surprised.

3115
02:13:23,670 --> 02:13:25,170
Come on, Logan.

3116
02:13:25,570 --> 02:13:27,399
I'm trying to get the energy from the crowd...

3117
02:13:27,400 --> 02:13:28,670
and just get everyone hyped.

3118
02:13:36,480 --> 02:13:37,650
I went more powerful.

3119
02:13:39,080 --> 02:13:41,280
- Come on, Logan. - Let's go.

3120
02:13:41,450 --> 02:13:44,150
It was time for Logan to be Logan.

3121
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:46,960
She's predictable.

3122
02:13:47,360 --> 02:13:48,630
Logan.

3123
02:13:54,360 --> 02:13:57,000
Her moves didn't match the music.

3124
02:13:59,570 --> 02:14:00,840
It wasn't intimidating.

3125
02:14:02,470 --> 02:14:04,780
I just focused on what I'm going to do,

3126
02:14:08,010 --> 02:14:09,380
Go.

3127
02:14:09,580 --> 02:14:10,610
I wasn't sure.

3128
02:14:20,360 --> 02:14:23,560
She provides something that no one else can do.

3129
02:14:23,760 --> 02:14:25,100
(Something like this)

3130
02:14:27,260 --> 02:14:28,670
Oh, my gosh.

3131
02:14:29,900 --> 02:14:31,670
I just want to intimidate them.

3132
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,540
It wasn't surprising. That's what she does all the time.

3133
02:14:39,680 --> 02:14:40,940
(That hurts.)

3134
02:14:44,680 --> 02:14:45,880
Logan.

3135
02:14:46,820 --> 02:14:49,189
I felt confident. I was like, "Okay. I'm done."

3136
02:14:49,190 --> 02:14:51,960
It's just so incredible and capable.

3137
02:14:52,260 --> 02:14:53,290
Crazy.

3138
02:14:53,690 --> 02:14:55,059
Switch. BUMSUP.

3139
02:14:55,060 --> 02:14:56,659
(Round 3 1-on-1 Battle, BUMSUP goes next.)

3140
02:14:56,660 --> 02:14:58,829
Logan and Lip J. Part Two.

3141
02:14:58,830 --> 02:15:01,360
I must not lose for the team.

3142
02:15:02,230 --> 02:15:03,470
Just see what happens.

3143
02:15:03,730 --> 02:15:05,499
Let's go.

3144
02:15:05,500 --> 02:15:06,500
(Intrigued)

3145
02:15:09,670 --> 02:15:12,810
I thought it would be best to make movements that fit the music.

3146
02:15:14,140 --> 02:15:15,980
Be sharp.

3147
02:15:16,280 --> 02:15:19,020
(Sharp)

3148
02:15:19,450 --> 02:15:20,579
(She nailed it.)

3149
02:15:20,580 --> 02:15:22,590
It was a little more aggressive.

3150
02:15:23,920 --> 02:15:25,160
Go, Lip J!

3151
02:15:30,490 --> 02:15:32,800
I must do my best to win.

3152
02:15:36,270 --> 02:15:37,330
(Loving it)

3153
02:15:37,430 --> 02:15:38,440
(Impressed)

3154
02:15:39,870 --> 02:15:41,340
Oh, she's serious.

3155
02:15:43,870 --> 02:15:45,380
I wasn't scared at all.

3156
02:15:46,080 --> 02:15:47,840
I guess I'll have to show you one more time.

3157
02:15:47,910 --> 02:15:49,050
Go.

3158
02:15:50,210 --> 02:15:51,350
That was fun.

3159
02:15:54,720 --> 02:15:56,420
I was not intimidated.

3160
02:15:56,520 --> 02:15:59,789
Let's go.

3161
02:15:59,790 --> 02:16:00,790
(Here we go.)

3162
02:16:02,830 --> 02:16:05,111
The accuracy of the movement and the timing of the music.

3163
02:16:11,030 --> 02:16:12,670
I did what it took to win.

3164
02:16:14,470 --> 02:16:17,009
(Explosive cheers)

3165
02:16:17,010 --> 02:16:19,109
How do you even compare that?

3166
02:16:19,110 --> 02:16:20,740
Like how?

3167
02:16:21,340 --> 02:16:22,779
- It's hard. - That's so hard.

3168
02:16:22,780 --> 02:16:23,910
Two different styles.

3169
02:16:24,810 --> 02:16:28,450
BUMSUP and MOTIV's battle is now over.

3170
02:16:29,750 --> 02:16:32,060
I'm overwhelmed.

3171
02:16:33,190 --> 02:16:34,319
That's my sister.

3172
02:16:34,320 --> 02:16:36,589
Lip J!

3173
02:16:36,590 --> 02:16:37,590
(Good job.)

3174
02:16:37,860 --> 02:16:40,260
- Good job. - You did well.

3175
02:16:40,460 --> 02:16:41,869
(Logistx's cheerleaders)

3176
02:16:41,870 --> 02:16:43,129
I couldn't command in that round.

3177
02:16:43,130 --> 02:16:45,639
- That was fire. - You ate them.

3178
02:16:45,640 --> 02:16:48,440
Also, the crowd and everyone were...

3179
02:16:48,710 --> 02:16:50,539
I thought I won.

3180
02:16:50,540 --> 02:16:52,039
Of course, I'm going to feel...

3181
02:16:52,040 --> 02:16:53,840
confident like I just smoked them.

3182
02:16:54,180 --> 02:16:56,680
Let's check the result.

3183
02:16:57,080 --> 02:16:58,349
It's hard to judge.

3184
02:16:58,350 --> 02:17:01,449
Two different styles. Like really opposite.

3185
02:17:01,450 --> 02:17:04,590
For the bigger part, it was not about the skills.

3186
02:17:04,690 --> 02:17:06,790
At times, you weren't listening to the music.

3187
02:17:07,820 --> 02:17:11,490
(He was sad that she had not listened to the music.)

3188
02:17:11,700 --> 02:17:14,329
And waacking, for my side,

3189
02:17:14,330 --> 02:17:16,530
you were in your comfort zone too much.

3190
02:17:20,240 --> 02:17:23,240
So it was tight to judge. Let's see.

3191
02:17:23,340 --> 02:17:24,340
Thank you.
(Nervous, anxious)

3192
02:17:25,341 --> 02:17:28,680
Fight Judges Park Jin Young and Lia Kim.

3193
02:17:28,780 --> 02:17:30,610
Open your cards.

3194
02:17:32,150 --> 02:17:34,349
(2 votes for BUMSUP)

3195
02:17:34,350 --> 02:17:35,619
(Thank you.)

3196
02:17:35,620 --> 02:17:39,920
Fight Judges Poppin'C and Mike Song.

3197
02:17:40,390 --> 02:17:42,260
Open your cards.

3198
02:17:42,560 --> 02:17:43,589
Hey.

3199
02:17:43,590 --> 02:17:44,730
(2 votes for MOTIV)

3200
02:17:46,500 --> 02:17:48,099
(Relieved)

3201
02:17:48,100 --> 02:17:50,300
The current score is 2 to 2.

3202
02:17:50,600 --> 02:17:51,600
Both were so different.

3203
02:17:52,100 --> 02:17:53,640
Whoever wins, it's not weird.

3204
02:17:54,240 --> 02:17:57,210
Which crew will take the win?

3205
02:17:57,840 --> 02:18:00,679
Should I say you both represent each genre?

3206
02:18:00,680 --> 02:18:05,379
I liked how you expressed your advantages in the battle.

3207
02:18:05,380 --> 02:18:09,790
The match between your music and representative styles.

3208
02:18:10,090 --> 02:18:11,689
I think the balance...

3209
02:18:11,690 --> 02:18:15,430
determined the result this time.

3210
02:18:16,530 --> 02:18:18,089
"I got the win."

3211
02:18:18,090 --> 02:18:19,629
I do feel confident.

3212
02:18:19,630 --> 02:18:21,060
Open your cards.

3213
02:18:24,370 --> 02:18:26,500
(Round 3, 1-on-1 Battle, BUMSUP wins.)

3214
02:18:27,140 --> 02:18:29,239
With a score of 3 to 2,

3215
02:18:29,240 --> 02:18:30,839
BUMSUP wins...

3216
02:18:30,840 --> 02:18:32,179
- Round Three. - No way.

3217
02:18:32,180 --> 02:18:34,179
- Good job. - Just one more.

3218
02:18:34,180 --> 02:18:36,610
- One more. - We'll bring victory home.

3219
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:38,579
- You're all dead. - Are you crying?

3220
02:18:38,580 --> 02:18:39,979
Don't cry.

3221
02:18:39,980 --> 02:18:43,049
Things were great when we had the win.

3222
02:18:43,050 --> 02:18:46,959
And we got 2 wins. We only had 1 left.

3223
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:49,030
Let's focus and win.

3224
02:18:49,230 --> 02:18:51,130
(Regrettable)

3225
02:18:51,530 --> 02:18:52,660
Two wins now?

3226
02:18:53,230 --> 02:18:54,230
Now they're two wins?

3227
02:18:54,231 --> 02:18:55,430
Yes, 2 and 1.

3228
02:18:56,530 --> 02:18:57,630
Which means...

3229
02:18:57,900 --> 02:19:00,470
all BUMSUP needs is one more win...

3230
02:19:00,870 --> 02:19:03,709
to take us out of this competition.

3231
02:19:03,710 --> 02:19:05,440
So this is...

3232
02:19:06,380 --> 02:19:08,210
do or die now.

3233
02:19:08,880 --> 02:19:12,449
In Round 3's fierce 1-on-1 Battle,

3234
02:19:12,450 --> 02:19:15,649
as BUMSUP got one more win,

3235
02:19:15,650 --> 02:19:18,489
the current score is 2 to 1.

3236
02:19:18,490 --> 02:19:20,860
BUMSUP got the 1st 2 wins.

3237
02:19:21,220 --> 02:19:23,229
If they win this round again,

3238
02:19:23,230 --> 02:19:25,330
they're guaranteed to enter the final.

3239
02:19:25,730 --> 02:19:27,599
What we need is one more win.

3240
02:19:27,600 --> 02:19:28,969
Let's cheer up.

3241
02:19:28,970 --> 02:19:31,700
The only battle for MOTIV who has one win...

3242
02:19:31,940 --> 02:19:34,999
to seize the last chance.

3243
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:38,239
They must win in this round.

3244
02:19:38,240 --> 02:19:41,640
I was feeling a crossroads.

3245
02:19:42,010 --> 02:19:43,550
Round Four is...

3246
02:19:43,810 --> 02:19:46,349
a 2-on-2 Duet Battle.

3247
02:19:46,350 --> 02:19:49,620
(Let's do it one more time.)

3248
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:51,490
Okay. Two-on-two. Let's go.

3249
02:19:51,620 --> 02:19:53,290
(Which crew will go 1st in Round 4?)

3250
02:19:59,500 --> 02:20:00,500
We're going first.

3251
02:20:00,501 --> 02:20:01,769
Yes, we're going first.

3252
02:20:01,770 --> 02:20:03,329
Let's listen to the music first and decide.

3253
02:20:03,330 --> 02:20:04,669
It didn't matter.

3254
02:20:04,670 --> 02:20:05,969
I couldn't feel more confident.

3255
02:20:05,970 --> 02:20:08,139
Hyojin and Monika...

3256
02:20:08,140 --> 02:20:12,109
prepared a routine to have fun.

3257
02:20:12,110 --> 02:20:13,939
Leejung and no: ze.

3258
02:20:13,940 --> 02:20:16,279
They prepared a routine to intimidate the other team.

3259
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:17,379
(A unique combination between Aiki and someone else)

3260
02:20:17,380 --> 02:20:18,649
I like it.

3261
02:20:18,650 --> 02:20:20,179
I love it.

3262
02:20:20,180 --> 02:20:22,919
It'd be fun to team up with her.

3263
02:20:22,920 --> 02:20:26,919
It's a combination no one has seen before.

3264
02:20:26,920 --> 02:20:29,429
It'd be a waste not to use that routine.

3265
02:20:29,430 --> 02:20:30,430
That's what I mean.

3266
02:20:30,431 --> 02:20:31,560
That is...

3267
02:20:32,160 --> 02:20:34,459
They've got to do it.

3268
02:20:34,460 --> 02:20:36,329
It'll be different...

3269
02:20:36,330 --> 02:20:39,139
from the 2-on-2 battles we've seen until now.

3270
02:20:39,140 --> 02:20:40,499
I felt so confident.

3271
02:20:40,500 --> 02:20:41,940
We got this round.

3272
02:20:42,770 --> 02:20:45,639
I still wasn't intimidated by what she did.

3273
02:20:45,640 --> 02:20:47,839
I had really strong routines.

3274
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:50,109
I think what we've learned on the show is,

3275
02:20:50,110 --> 02:20:52,079
a lot of unexpected things can happen,

3276
02:20:52,080 --> 02:20:53,749
so be prepared for the worst.

3277
02:20:53,750 --> 02:20:55,489
No matter what they do...

3278
02:20:55,490 --> 02:20:56,619
Bella and Nyssa.

3279
02:20:56,620 --> 02:20:57,849
- Abby. Yes. - Kaidi.

3280
02:20:57,850 --> 02:21:00,919
How different styles can be done in different tempos...

3281
02:21:00,920 --> 02:21:05,159
Abby and Kaidi had a more girly routine.

3282
02:21:05,160 --> 02:21:07,929
Nyssa and Bella's duo was still hip-hop.

3283
02:21:07,930 --> 02:21:10,569
No matter what, we're going to showcase something really special.

3284
02:21:10,570 --> 02:21:13,769
I knew that that was the best option to showcase.

3285
02:21:13,770 --> 02:21:17,639
That we actually can provide what the judges are looking for.

3286
02:21:17,640 --> 02:21:21,239
The crews' fate depends on the 2-on-2 Duet Battle.

3287
02:21:21,240 --> 02:21:23,450
It begins now.

3288
02:21:23,710 --> 02:21:26,220
This one is very important.

3289
02:21:26,350 --> 02:21:27,619
(Good luck to both.)

3290
02:21:27,620 --> 02:21:29,590
You guys ready? Fight.

3291
02:21:30,290 --> 02:21:32,959
We prepared so much for the 2-on-2 battle.

3292
02:21:32,960 --> 02:21:35,529
I'm 100 percent confident that BUMSUP will win.

3293
02:21:35,530 --> 02:21:36,929
(Good luck, BUMSUP.)

3294
02:21:36,930 --> 02:21:40,099
Not knowing what duo battle was going to go next..

3295
02:21:40,100 --> 02:21:42,669
People said we were obvious.

3296
02:21:42,670 --> 02:21:44,300
So we'll have to show something new.

3297
02:21:45,470 --> 02:21:47,339
(Lip J and Aiki come forward.)

3298
02:21:47,340 --> 02:21:49,170
(Incredible combination)

3299
02:21:49,610 --> 02:21:53,539
I just didn't expect Aiki and Lip J to be a duo together.

3300
02:21:53,540 --> 02:21:55,379
I knew it was an unexpected weapon...

3301
02:21:55,380 --> 02:21:57,479
that would create a fatal attack.

3302
02:21:57,480 --> 02:21:58,580
- Hey! - Lip J.

3303
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:00,049
(Loving it)

3304
02:22:00,050 --> 02:22:02,050
Come on. Let's go!

3305
02:22:02,390 --> 02:22:05,119
As if Lip J were originally a Latin dancer,

3306
02:22:05,120 --> 02:22:08,590
they had perfect teamwork. It was great.

3307
02:22:10,090 --> 02:22:11,090
Let's go.

3308
02:22:11,091 --> 02:22:12,100
(Falling)

3309
02:22:13,530 --> 02:22:16,599
They did a style that I didn't expect either.

3310
02:22:16,600 --> 02:22:18,969
I thought it'd work strategically.

3311
02:22:18,970 --> 02:22:20,840
I thought that was a winning routine.

3312
02:22:22,640 --> 02:22:23,769
(Let's go, Ai-Lip.)

3313
02:22:23,770 --> 02:22:27,140
It didn't hit with crazy intensity, so I was not scared.

3314
02:22:28,780 --> 02:22:31,179
Let's be the winner of the day.

3315
02:22:31,180 --> 02:22:32,820
- Let's go! - Let's go!

3316
02:22:33,080 --> 02:22:34,080
Let's go.

3317
02:22:37,390 --> 02:22:38,390
Aiki!

3318
02:22:38,391 --> 02:22:39,520
(100 percent excited)

3319
02:22:40,020 --> 02:22:41,020
Let's go!

3320
02:22:43,860 --> 02:22:46,730
We might take this battle.

3321
02:22:47,300 --> 02:22:48,970
(I can do that too.)

3322
02:22:49,530 --> 02:22:52,469
I can't wait to win and be over with it.

3323
02:22:52,470 --> 02:22:54,399
I think we have a chance.

3324
02:22:54,400 --> 02:22:56,740
Countdown. Five, four,

3325
02:22:57,010 --> 02:22:59,639
three, two, one.

3326
02:22:59,640 --> 02:23:01,339
Switch. MOTIV.

3327
02:23:01,340 --> 02:23:03,179
(BUMSUP nailed it.)

3328
02:23:03,180 --> 02:23:04,910
MOTIV, let's go!

3329
02:23:05,680 --> 02:23:07,620
(Who's it going to be?)

3330
02:23:07,820 --> 02:23:12,219
Duo battle that we decide is what determines if we go home or not.

3331
02:23:12,220 --> 02:23:16,130
So I needed to be very smart about the choice that I make.

3332
02:23:16,360 --> 02:23:18,389
(Marlee made the decision after listening to the music.)

3333
02:23:18,390 --> 02:23:22,029
It was time for Nyssa and Bella to do their routines.

3334
02:23:22,030 --> 02:23:23,099
It doesn't matter...

3335
02:23:23,100 --> 02:23:25,069
- who our opponent is. - We're the best.

3336
02:23:25,070 --> 02:23:28,199
Giving it my all and really fighting for my team.

3337
02:23:28,200 --> 02:23:29,600
(Bella and Nyssa of MOTIV go next.)

3338
02:23:32,380 --> 02:23:33,610
(That's it!)

3339
02:23:33,980 --> 02:23:35,420
- They had crazy energy. - Let's go!

3340
02:23:38,850 --> 02:23:41,450
There's absolutely no way that we're losing this point.

3341
02:23:44,350 --> 02:23:45,790
Oh, my gosh.

3342
02:23:46,320 --> 02:23:48,189
They were in fight mode.

3343
02:23:48,190 --> 02:23:50,730
I was so locked in in every second.

3344
02:23:53,130 --> 02:23:56,130
See how strong of a crew we are.

3345
02:23:57,170 --> 02:23:58,230
(Good job.)

3346
02:23:59,840 --> 02:24:03,069
The fact that they were moving forward aggressively...

3347
02:24:03,070 --> 02:24:05,880
said that they were desperate.

3348
02:24:07,140 --> 02:24:08,779
We're not here to play.

3349
02:24:08,780 --> 02:24:10,179
We're going to have to send them home.

3350
02:24:10,180 --> 02:24:11,180
(Go home!)
(No way!)

3351
02:24:12,180 --> 02:24:13,180
(In awe)

3352
02:24:13,181 --> 02:24:15,390
If anyone's going to be eliminated, that will be MOTIV.

3353
02:24:17,350 --> 02:24:20,089
Countdown. Five, four,

3354
02:24:20,090 --> 02:24:23,059
three, two, one.

3355
02:24:23,060 --> 02:24:25,190
Battle over.

3356
02:24:27,430 --> 02:24:28,969
(Amazed)

3357
02:24:28,970 --> 02:24:30,770
(Cheering)

3358
02:24:30,900 --> 02:24:33,000
It's so hard to compare, man.

3359
02:24:33,400 --> 02:24:35,539
This is so close.

3360
02:24:35,540 --> 02:24:36,869
- Was it okay? - It was crazy.

3361
02:24:36,870 --> 02:24:39,079
I'm confident that we got this.

3362
02:24:39,080 --> 02:24:40,510
I'm very confident.

3363
02:24:40,710 --> 02:24:41,940
That was a good choice.

3364
02:24:42,510 --> 02:24:44,210
They ate that.

3365
02:24:45,420 --> 02:24:46,649
This is really hard to judge.

3366
02:24:46,650 --> 02:24:47,650
It's true.

3367
02:24:48,380 --> 02:24:50,390
Fight Judge Mike Song.

3368
02:24:50,720 --> 02:24:53,989
What did you think of BUMSUP and MOTIV's Duet Battle?

3369
02:24:53,990 --> 02:24:56,629
This is so hard to compare.

3370
02:24:56,630 --> 02:24:59,659
Right when the round just finished, all of us looked at each other.

3371
02:24:59,660 --> 02:25:01,030
How do we even do this?

3372
02:25:02,170 --> 02:25:05,129
There's no rubric for judging this.

3373
02:25:05,130 --> 02:25:07,599
So, again, this is all so subjective.

3374
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:09,139
Lip J and Aiki.

3375
02:25:09,140 --> 02:25:12,139
It was very smart. The strategy behind bringing in...

3376
02:25:12,140 --> 02:25:15,009
such an unpredictable style to this battle and the stage.

3377
02:25:15,010 --> 02:25:17,109
I think the partner work and just the shapes...

3378
02:25:17,110 --> 02:25:20,149
that you guys chose to use were just unique.

3379
02:25:20,150 --> 02:25:22,350
So I appreciate the battle strategy.

3380
02:25:22,720 --> 02:25:24,020
- Thank you. - Thank you.

3381
02:25:24,520 --> 02:25:26,619
Bella and Nyssa, I feel like, you know,

3382
02:25:26,620 --> 02:25:28,719
you guys came with a style that is...

3383
02:25:28,720 --> 02:25:31,359
almost expected from what you guys would bring.

3384
02:25:31,360 --> 02:25:33,659
But somehow, you guys find a way...

3385
02:25:33,660 --> 02:25:36,469
to keep adding these dynamics that make it spicy.

3386
02:25:36,470 --> 02:25:39,339
And I think that's just a high ability...

3387
02:25:39,340 --> 02:25:41,569
in understanding how to make moments.

3388
02:25:41,570 --> 02:25:44,010
I feel like there was strategy on both sides.

3389
02:25:45,780 --> 02:25:46,780
Thank you.

3390
02:25:46,880 --> 02:25:50,150
In Team Korea, I really like how you mixed the styles.

3391
02:25:50,580 --> 02:25:54,050
How you used the space. The technique, the musicality.

3392
02:25:54,220 --> 02:25:56,490
I really appreciate that. Big respect.

3393
02:25:59,660 --> 02:26:01,359
MOTIV competed...

3394
02:26:01,360 --> 02:26:04,889
with their straight style.

3395
02:26:04,890 --> 02:26:07,259
And that had the power.

3396
02:26:07,260 --> 02:26:12,029
I judged based on how the two crews expressed their universes...

3397
02:26:12,030 --> 02:26:14,669
by dancing to the music.

3398
02:26:14,670 --> 02:26:16,269
(What's the result of Round 4 that will determine their fate?)

3399
02:26:16,270 --> 02:26:17,510
Thank you.

3400
02:26:17,810 --> 02:26:20,880
We'll now check the result of the battle.

3401
02:26:21,080 --> 02:26:22,909
I think BUMSUP will win.

3402
02:26:22,910 --> 02:26:25,210
I thought we killed it.

3403
02:26:25,550 --> 02:26:27,279
If I had a role,

3404
02:26:27,280 --> 02:26:29,590
it would be to get a good result.

3405
02:26:30,890 --> 02:26:33,290
I like that duo. Those two.

3406
02:26:33,490 --> 02:26:35,589
I think MOTIV will win, and then the tiebreaker.

3407
02:26:35,590 --> 02:26:38,159
We really went all in.

3408
02:26:38,160 --> 02:26:40,999
I'm just ready for them to flip those cards,

3409
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:42,730
and it'll all be orange.

3410
02:26:43,070 --> 02:26:47,600
Fight Judges, open your cards.

3411
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:50,510
(How did Fight Judges decide the result of Round 4?)

3412
02:26:51,470 --> 02:26:53,139
(Startled)

3413
02:26:53,140 --> 02:26:54,710
(For real?)

3414
02:26:58,510 --> 02:27:00,619
With the score of five to none,

3415
02:27:00,620 --> 02:27:03,750
MOTIV won Round Four.

3416
02:27:04,050 --> 02:27:07,089
I was just really really glad...

3417
02:27:07,090 --> 02:27:09,589
that I got to take that win for the team.

3418
02:27:09,590 --> 02:27:12,800
I'm ready to see another win for our team.

3419
02:27:14,430 --> 02:27:16,569
(BUMSUP lost Round 4.)

3420
02:27:16,570 --> 02:27:19,369
You did a good job. It's okay.

3421
02:27:19,370 --> 02:27:21,139
- It's okay. - You did a great job.

3422
02:27:21,140 --> 02:27:22,409
It's okay.

3423
02:27:22,410 --> 02:27:23,539
It was such a bummer.

3424
02:27:23,540 --> 02:27:27,879
I didn't want to give pressure for the last 1-on-1 Battle.

3425
02:27:27,880 --> 02:27:29,149
So I wanted to win.

3426
02:27:29,150 --> 02:27:30,980
I felt bad that the pressure was on.

3427
02:27:31,710 --> 02:27:33,219
"This is bad."

3428
02:27:33,220 --> 02:27:36,020
All I could think about was that we were in trouble.

3429
02:27:36,820 --> 02:27:38,120
I don't want to go home.

3430
02:27:38,790 --> 02:27:41,189
It's the end.

3431
02:27:41,190 --> 02:27:42,190
It's okay.

3432
02:27:42,191 --> 02:27:44,289
- Good job. It was fun. - Yes.

3433
02:27:44,290 --> 02:27:45,959
It's okay. We did it.

3434
02:27:45,960 --> 02:27:46,960
Okay.

3435
02:27:47,060 --> 02:27:48,459
Last round.

3436
02:27:48,460 --> 02:27:49,530
Too much pressure.

3437
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:51,329
Last American team. Last Korean team.

3438
02:27:51,330 --> 02:27:52,769
Oh, crazy.

3439
02:27:52,770 --> 02:27:54,539
Now, a single round will determine...

3440
02:27:54,540 --> 02:27:57,070
who enters the final.

3441
02:27:57,540 --> 02:28:00,010
The last round of fate is...

3442
02:28:00,240 --> 02:28:02,140
the 1-on-1 Battle.

3443
02:28:02,310 --> 02:28:03,749
Whoever it's going to be, don't feel pressured.

3444
02:28:03,750 --> 02:28:04,949
- Right. - Never.

3445
02:28:04,950 --> 02:28:06,620
Don't feel pressured. Don't feel bad.

3446
02:28:06,720 --> 02:28:07,720
- Okay? - Yes.

3447
02:28:08,020 --> 02:28:10,120
We're not even Street Woman Fighters right now.

3448
02:28:10,320 --> 02:28:11,419
We're the jam.

3449
02:28:11,420 --> 02:28:12,620
- We are. - We are.

3450
02:28:12,820 --> 02:28:14,396
Who do you think is going to come out from MOTIV?

3451
02:28:14,420 --> 02:28:17,090
It's either going to be Fantaye or Marlee.

3452
02:28:17,290 --> 02:28:18,659
It looks like it's going to be Fantaye.

3453
02:28:18,660 --> 02:28:20,660
Fantaye didn't even battle today.

3454
02:28:20,860 --> 02:28:22,800
The leader's probably going to come forward.

3455
02:28:23,870 --> 02:28:25,769
As far as our 1-on-1 battles go,

3456
02:28:25,770 --> 02:28:27,000
we just got heat.

3457
02:28:27,100 --> 02:28:28,499
Heat.

3458
02:28:28,500 --> 02:28:32,239
The solo rounds would probably be me, Marlee, or Fantaye.

3459
02:28:32,240 --> 02:28:34,239
It would be us three because we battle.

3460
02:28:34,240 --> 02:28:36,250
Fantaye is an amazing battler.

3461
02:28:36,710 --> 02:28:40,080
She freestyles a lot. She battles a lot.

3462
02:28:40,380 --> 02:28:43,120
She's well-respected in that space in LA.

3463
02:28:44,890 --> 02:28:47,619
Marlee is very creative.

3464
02:28:47,620 --> 02:28:48,660
She's above.

3465
02:28:49,330 --> 02:28:52,300
She is a natural-born leader, and she's a strong individual.

3466
02:28:52,800 --> 02:28:56,600
Fantaye and Marlee will, for sure, kill it in battles.

3467
02:28:57,570 --> 02:28:59,410
- I'm not intimidated at all. - Can you do it?

3468
02:28:59,900 --> 02:29:01,139
They've got Ri.hey with them.

3469
02:29:01,140 --> 02:29:02,739
- Ri.hey. - Ri.hey.

3470
02:29:02,740 --> 02:29:05,440
I could see Honey J and Ri.hey going out.

3471
02:29:06,040 --> 02:29:09,179
You know how Ri.hey was crazy in the Elimination Battle?

3472
02:29:09,180 --> 02:29:10,249
She's the master of the Elimination Battle.

3473
02:29:10,250 --> 02:29:11,550
She was amazing.

3474
02:29:11,580 --> 02:29:14,079
Her desperate moves...

3475
02:29:14,080 --> 02:29:17,420
and aggressive style are very cool.

3476
02:29:17,820 --> 02:29:19,860
She's a strong battler.

3477
02:29:19,890 --> 02:29:22,020
Honestly, she often carried the team.

3478
02:29:24,230 --> 02:29:25,230
(Ri.hey looks serious before the battle.)

3479
02:29:25,231 --> 02:29:26,860
- Are you okay? - Yes.

3480
02:29:27,700 --> 02:29:30,400
I'll put on the waistband for the team battle.

3481
02:29:30,700 --> 02:29:31,870
I'll take it off later.

3482
02:29:32,270 --> 02:29:35,370
My waist is in bad condition.

3483
02:29:35,570 --> 02:29:38,670
I want to do the 1-on-1 Battle, but I'm worried.

3484
02:29:39,380 --> 02:29:41,309
I prepared myself for the 1-on-1 Battle...

3485
02:29:41,310 --> 02:29:44,150
since we never knew what was going to happen.

3486
02:29:44,480 --> 02:29:47,320
I want to be with them to the end.

3487
02:29:47,420 --> 02:29:50,620
I'll give my all as if this is the end.

3488
02:29:51,550 --> 02:29:53,690
Confidence. Be confident.

3489
02:29:54,160 --> 02:29:57,260
- Hip-hop versus hip-hop. - Yes.

3490
02:29:58,130 --> 02:29:59,430
Okay. Bottle time.

3491
02:30:01,330 --> 02:30:03,499
MOTIV will go first in Round Five.

3492
02:30:03,500 --> 02:30:05,100
And BUMSUP will go second.

3493
02:30:06,140 --> 02:30:07,800
Let's go.

3494
02:30:07,940 --> 02:30:09,639
Let's go.

3495
02:30:09,640 --> 02:30:11,209
(Good luck to both teams.)

3496
02:30:11,210 --> 02:30:13,980
The final battle for the fate of the two crews.

3497
02:30:14,180 --> 02:30:16,250
It starts now.

3498
02:30:16,750 --> 02:30:19,010
- Let's go. - You guys ready?

3499
02:30:19,720 --> 02:30:20,720
Fight.

3500
02:30:20,721 --> 02:30:22,020
Let's go.

3501
02:30:22,950 --> 02:30:24,190
Let's go, Marlee.

3502
02:30:24,690 --> 02:30:26,060
- It's Marlee. - She's first.

3503
02:30:26,820 --> 02:30:27,820
(Okay. Come on.)

3504
02:30:29,960 --> 02:30:32,029
- As the leader of this team, - Marlee!

3505
02:30:32,030 --> 02:30:33,960
I have to fight for my team.

3506
02:30:40,470 --> 02:30:42,200
Their team. Their logo is a tiger.

3507
02:30:44,270 --> 02:30:47,610
So the impression that I left in my round has to be so grand.

3508
02:30:49,450 --> 02:30:51,379
She is killing it right now.

3509
02:30:51,380 --> 02:30:52,520
(Squealing)

3510
02:30:52,750 --> 02:30:54,120
I think I can win.

3511
02:30:54,220 --> 02:30:56,520
There's a quality difference, 100 percent.

3512
02:30:59,860 --> 02:31:01,519
This is freestyling.

3513
02:31:01,520 --> 02:31:02,590
(Marlee's freestyle)

3514
02:31:07,200 --> 02:31:08,460
Marlee, come on.

3515
02:31:08,900 --> 02:31:11,299
In the song, it sounded like I was getting a phone call.

3516
02:31:11,300 --> 02:31:12,500
Hello?

3517
02:31:15,700 --> 02:31:16,839
Picking up the phone.

3518
02:31:16,840 --> 02:31:19,639
Oh, they called. They told us that we won.

3519
02:31:19,640 --> 02:31:20,839
(Marlee's witty.)

3520
02:31:20,840 --> 02:31:22,580
It'll be over after answering the phone.

3521
02:31:23,250 --> 02:31:25,820
I just tried to exude confidence in that round.

3522
02:31:28,620 --> 02:31:29,850
Let's go, Marlee.

3523
02:31:30,350 --> 02:31:35,489
Countdown. Five, four, three, two, one.

3524
02:31:35,490 --> 02:31:36,930
Switch. BUMSUP.

3525
02:31:38,190 --> 02:31:40,100
The pride we have in being Team Orange.

3526
02:31:40,760 --> 02:31:41,999
(Startled)

3527
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:43,930
(Intrigued)

3528
02:31:44,070 --> 02:31:46,939
- Switch. BUMSUP. - BUMSUP.

3529
02:31:46,940 --> 02:31:47,999
(It's BUMSUP's time.)

3530
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:49,100
Who's it going to be?

3531
02:31:49,840 --> 02:31:51,840
(Ri.hey comes forward.)

3532
02:31:51,870 --> 02:31:53,709
Okay.

3533
02:31:53,710 --> 02:31:55,709
I was surprised, but it also made sense.

3534
02:31:55,710 --> 02:31:57,450
She's a strong hip-hop dancer.

3535
02:31:57,950 --> 02:31:59,749
They're counting on me.

3536
02:31:59,750 --> 02:32:02,550
Even if my body gets shattered, I better step forward.

3537
02:32:05,890 --> 02:32:07,489
(Ready to be possessed)

3538
02:32:07,490 --> 02:32:09,530
Let's go, Ri.hey.

3539
02:32:15,700 --> 02:32:16,830
(Oh, my gosh!)

3540
02:32:18,570 --> 02:32:21,199
I tried to go as deep as I could...

3541
02:32:21,200 --> 02:32:22,810
so I could deliver energy in every move.

3542
02:32:28,010 --> 02:32:29,350
Yes.

3543
02:32:30,810 --> 02:32:33,520
I still wasn't intimidated by what she did.

3544
02:32:34,820 --> 02:32:36,320
- Hey. - Yes.

3545
02:32:39,820 --> 02:32:42,189
Our survival is on the line.

3546
02:32:42,190 --> 02:32:43,490
I better go crazy.

3547
02:32:46,230 --> 02:32:47,500
Ri.hey won.

3548
02:32:47,530 --> 02:32:50,070
- Let's go! - Let's go!

3549
02:32:56,210 --> 02:33:02,140
Countdown. Five, four, three, two, one.

3550
02:33:02,240 --> 02:33:04,710
Battle over.

3551
02:33:05,880 --> 02:33:09,789
(The last Elimination Battle of World of Street Woman Fighter ends.)

3552
02:33:09,790 --> 02:33:11,349
(Cheering)

3553
02:33:11,350 --> 02:33:13,160
Marlee.

3554
02:33:13,460 --> 02:33:14,590
Smoke show.

3555
02:33:15,420 --> 02:33:17,129
I don't even remember what I did.

3556
02:33:17,130 --> 02:33:21,399
That means you pulled it off. You were amazing.

3557
02:33:21,400 --> 02:33:25,130
- You were possessed. - I'm so proud of you.

3558
02:33:25,600 --> 02:33:29,540
I think your musicality and performance outshine.

3559
02:33:29,570 --> 02:33:32,070
- You played. - Yes, I tried to play.

3560
02:33:32,270 --> 02:33:35,110
Ri.hey's crazy. I didn't know she was like that.

3561
02:33:35,480 --> 02:33:37,280
It was an interesting roll, but you know?

3562
02:33:37,450 --> 02:33:40,679
Foundationally, everything dance skills-wise,

3563
02:33:40,680 --> 02:33:42,120
Marlee's obviously better.

3564
02:33:42,850 --> 02:33:44,049
(Ri.hey versus Marlee)

3565
02:33:44,050 --> 02:33:45,289
That was good.

3566
02:33:45,290 --> 02:33:46,666
(The final battlers carry the weight of the final judgment.)

3567
02:33:46,690 --> 02:33:47,790
Amazing.

3568
02:33:49,390 --> 02:33:50,890
We cannot tie, right?

3569
02:33:51,030 --> 02:33:53,460
One more round. One more.

3570
02:33:54,200 --> 02:33:56,830
This is too much pressure. I don't want to judge.

3571
02:33:57,330 --> 02:33:59,439
Man, when they are different songs,

3572
02:33:59,440 --> 02:34:02,569
but still the same style... This is also hard.

3573
02:34:02,570 --> 02:34:05,710
- It's hard. Yes, of course. - Man.

3574
02:34:07,740 --> 02:34:09,380
What's the score going to be?

3575
02:34:10,580 --> 02:34:12,880
I think we'll enter the final.

3576
02:34:13,080 --> 02:34:15,520
The pressure must be crazy.

3577
02:34:15,620 --> 02:34:17,250
Fight Judge Mike Song.

3578
02:34:17,390 --> 02:34:20,320
What did you think of Round Five?

3579
02:34:20,460 --> 02:34:22,729
Every round was so hard to judge.

3580
02:34:22,730 --> 02:34:25,429
Again, I feel like the level is so high.

3581
02:34:25,430 --> 02:34:27,700
Marlee. I feel like you took a chance in your round.

3582
02:34:28,160 --> 02:34:30,129
"I'm going to go with the tiger."

3583
02:34:30,130 --> 02:34:31,569
"I'm going to call this concept out,"

3584
02:34:31,570 --> 02:34:32,799
"and I'm just going to trust the flow."

3585
02:34:32,800 --> 02:34:34,069
And I think there's a risk there,

3586
02:34:34,070 --> 02:34:36,509
but the fact that you went down that rabbit hole...

3587
02:34:36,510 --> 02:34:38,640
and just kept going shows a lot of composure.

3588
02:34:38,940 --> 02:34:41,040
And your ability to just dissect the music...

3589
02:34:41,240 --> 02:34:43,350
where it still feels like a natural flow.

3590
02:34:43,850 --> 02:34:45,809
The only thing that I wish I could've seen more...

3591
02:34:45,810 --> 02:34:49,890
is the intensity and the fire of the final battle.

3592
02:34:50,620 --> 02:34:51,920
When it switched to BUMSUP,

3593
02:34:52,250 --> 02:34:54,489
Ri.hey, you brought the fire.

3594
02:34:54,490 --> 02:34:56,689
Right when it started and the music changed,

3595
02:34:56,690 --> 02:34:59,359
the intensity was undeniable in the room.

3596
02:34:59,360 --> 02:35:00,360
You came in.

3597
02:35:00,361 --> 02:35:02,229
Everybody in the room. We could feel the vibe.

3598
02:35:02,230 --> 02:35:04,270
It was such a strong energy.

3599
02:35:05,870 --> 02:35:10,410
The only thing that felt off was how you spread.

3600
02:35:10,610 --> 02:35:13,580
Your movements. You didn't finish what you started.

3601
02:35:13,880 --> 02:35:15,809
In a battle, that's really important.

3602
02:35:15,810 --> 02:35:18,410
That's really important to be clear and clean.

3603
02:35:19,420 --> 02:35:22,449
When we judge, we want to hear and read your dance.

3604
02:35:22,450 --> 02:35:24,890
Let's see what happens. I made my decision.

3605
02:35:25,150 --> 02:35:26,620
It was really close.

3606
02:35:27,020 --> 02:35:28,060
Good job, guys.

3607
02:35:28,860 --> 02:35:29,960
Thank you.

3608
02:35:31,160 --> 02:35:35,160
Now, let's check the result of this battle.

3609
02:35:35,530 --> 02:35:36,700
Go, girls.

3610
02:35:37,330 --> 02:35:38,529
Should we...

3611
02:35:38,530 --> 02:35:40,340
(Getting close)

3612
02:35:40,440 --> 02:35:44,109
I'm confident in what Marlee did and her skill.

3613
02:35:44,110 --> 02:35:47,840
I feel pretty strongly that we're going to make it to the finals.

3614
02:35:48,280 --> 02:35:51,610
Regardless of the result, we did our best. Good job.

3615
02:35:51,750 --> 02:35:54,180
I hope the result is also good.

3616
02:35:54,420 --> 02:35:55,580
Fight Judge...

3617
02:35:56,250 --> 02:35:59,660
Lia Kim, open your card first.

3618
02:36:00,620 --> 02:36:03,060
Open your card.

3619
02:36:04,560 --> 02:36:05,560
(Lia Kim chose BUMSUP.)

3620
02:36:05,830 --> 02:36:07,500
(Grateful)

3621
02:36:07,830 --> 02:36:10,129
- Thank you. - I wanted to...

3622
02:36:10,130 --> 02:36:12,400
bring the win to my team.

3623
02:36:12,740 --> 02:36:13,740
I was nervous.

3624
02:36:13,741 --> 02:36:18,370
I was just mentally preparing for either result.

3625
02:36:19,210 --> 02:36:20,810
Oh, I can't watch.

3626
02:36:21,140 --> 02:36:22,480
Next, we'll check...

3627
02:36:22,540 --> 02:36:25,810
Poppin'C's card.

3628
02:36:26,820 --> 02:36:28,120
I think he chose MOTIV.

3629
02:36:28,720 --> 02:36:30,549
You're all going to vote for MOTIV.

3630
02:36:30,550 --> 02:36:31,620
Open your card.

3631
02:36:32,490 --> 02:36:34,490
(Poppin'C chose MOTIV.)

3632
02:36:35,160 --> 02:36:37,060
(Relieved)

3633
02:36:37,390 --> 02:36:39,090
We all trust Marlee.

3634
02:36:39,700 --> 02:36:41,599
- Okay. - I think Ri.hey really..

3635
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:43,500
Overcame the pressure and showed everyone.

3636
02:36:43,600 --> 02:36:45,100
She deserved the win.

3637
02:36:45,770 --> 02:36:47,800
The current score is 1 to 1.

3638
02:36:48,540 --> 02:36:50,370
This is tense.

3639
02:36:50,940 --> 02:36:57,880
Next, we'll open three fight judges' cards together.

3640
02:36:58,510 --> 02:36:59,519
What's going to happen?

3641
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:02,349
Our fate relies on this round.

3642
02:37:02,350 --> 02:37:05,289
What if my team gets eliminated because of me?

3643
02:37:05,290 --> 02:37:07,360
I was anxious and scared.

3644
02:37:07,720 --> 02:37:09,319
It wasn't easy to get this far.

3645
02:37:09,320 --> 02:37:12,490
The final is near. We're desperate.

3646
02:37:13,200 --> 02:37:15,929
I do feel we are one of the strongest teams.

3647
02:37:15,930 --> 02:37:17,730
We deserve to be in the finals.

3648
02:37:18,430 --> 02:37:20,240
Fight Judges,

3649
02:37:20,340 --> 02:37:22,570
open your cards.

3650
02:37:24,170 --> 02:37:26,709
Period.

3651
02:37:26,710 --> 02:37:27,740
(Startled)

3652
02:37:28,740 --> 02:37:30,280
No way.

3653
02:37:34,080 --> 02:37:36,150
The current score is 1 to 1.

3654
02:37:36,790 --> 02:37:38,590
This is tense.

3655
02:37:39,220 --> 02:37:46,160
Next, we'll open three fight judges' cards together.

3656
02:37:46,860 --> 02:37:47,860
What's going to happen?

3657
02:37:47,861 --> 02:37:50,599
Our fate relies on this round.

3658
02:37:50,600 --> 02:37:53,669
What if my team gets eliminated because of me?

3659
02:37:53,670 --> 02:37:55,670
I was anxious and scared.

3660
02:37:56,100 --> 02:37:57,669
It wasn't easy to get this far.

3661
02:37:57,670 --> 02:38:00,740
The final is near. We're desperate.

3662
02:38:01,610 --> 02:38:04,109
I do feel we are one of the strongest teams.

3663
02:38:04,110 --> 02:38:06,250
We deserve to be in the finals.

3664
02:38:06,680 --> 02:38:10,850
Fight Judges, open your cards.

3665
02:38:12,750 --> 02:38:15,619
(Everyone is shocked.)

3666
02:38:15,620 --> 02:38:17,360
No way.

3667
02:38:17,460 --> 02:38:19,190
(What's the result that shocked everyone?)

3668
02:38:20,100 --> 02:38:21,430
(All 3 fight judges chose MOTIV.)

3669
02:38:21,530 --> 02:38:23,299
(With the final score of 4 to 1, MOTIV won.)

3670
02:38:23,300 --> 02:38:25,570
(Startled)

3671
02:38:26,340 --> 02:38:30,039
(Everyone becomes speechless upon seeing the unexpected result.)

3672
02:38:30,040 --> 02:38:32,200
- With the final score of 4 to 1, - Thank you so much.

3673
02:38:33,180 --> 02:38:36,580
Team USA, MOTIV won.

3674
02:38:37,050 --> 02:38:40,620
I feel shaken and grateful.

3675
02:38:40,820 --> 02:38:44,290
It was a lot of our hard work that got us there.

3676
02:38:44,590 --> 02:38:46,089
- Congratulations to us all. - Thank you.

3677
02:38:46,090 --> 02:38:47,859
- Great job, you all. - You did great.

3678
02:38:47,860 --> 02:38:49,060
Great job.

3679
02:38:49,630 --> 02:38:52,260
(BUMSUP couldn't make it to the finals.)

3680
02:38:53,530 --> 02:38:55,529
Don't feel bad. You did well.

3681
02:38:55,530 --> 02:38:56,930
- You did well. - You did well.

3682
02:38:57,030 --> 02:38:58,800
I felt so bad.

3683
02:38:59,170 --> 02:39:01,600
I was the battler who participated in the last round.

3684
02:39:01,940 --> 02:39:03,840
I cried because Ri.hey was so cool.

3685
02:39:04,270 --> 02:39:07,080
- We did so well. - Well done.

3686
02:39:07,380 --> 02:39:11,150
You guys did so amazing this entire season.

3687
02:39:11,410 --> 02:39:13,350
Don't cry.

3688
02:39:13,820 --> 02:39:16,649
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

3689
02:39:16,650 --> 02:39:18,410
(Congratulations on advancing to the final.)

3690
02:39:19,250 --> 02:39:22,790
BUMSUP's gone? That's actually crazy.

3691
02:39:23,760 --> 02:39:26,059
(Eliminated crew: Team Korea, BUMSUP)

3692
02:39:26,060 --> 02:39:28,459
Thus, the third crew to be eliminated on...

3693
02:39:28,460 --> 02:39:30,499
- World of Street Woman Fighter... - Well done.

3694
02:39:30,500 --> 02:39:31,600
Is BUMSUP.

3695
02:39:32,230 --> 02:39:33,790
Well done. Everyone did an amazing job.

3696
02:39:34,570 --> 02:39:35,600
Well done.

3697
02:39:35,900 --> 02:39:39,640
(The members do their best to accept the result calmly.)

3698
02:39:40,440 --> 02:39:41,960
- Thank you for your hard work. - Yes.

3699
02:39:42,310 --> 02:39:44,750
- Thank you for your hard work. - The weight has been lifted.

3700
02:39:45,780 --> 02:39:47,420
No matter what it took,

3701
02:39:47,520 --> 02:39:51,890
we wanted to be there for the end of the show we started.

3702
02:39:52,090 --> 02:39:55,019
We held on for our lives and came this far.

3703
02:39:55,020 --> 02:39:56,119
(They gathered their desperation and poured out their strength.)

3704
02:39:56,120 --> 02:39:57,530
Thank you for your hard work.

3705
02:39:58,390 --> 02:40:01,559
So our journey ends here.

3706
02:40:01,560 --> 02:40:02,630
Well done, you guys.

3707
02:40:04,830 --> 02:40:05,930
That's so sad.

3708
02:40:08,700 --> 02:40:10,780
They're going to make me cry because they're crying.

3709
02:40:13,710 --> 02:40:15,609
The most important thing I want to say is this.

3710
02:40:15,610 --> 02:40:17,150
I hope you guys know...

3711
02:40:17,580 --> 02:40:20,580
that you guys set a foundation in Korea.

3712
02:40:20,680 --> 02:40:22,990
Season One of Street Woman Fighter...

3713
02:40:23,290 --> 02:40:27,020
brought out global crews for World of Street Woman Fighter.

3714
02:40:27,120 --> 02:40:29,320
That is crazy.

3715
02:40:29,420 --> 02:40:31,160
And that only happened...

3716
02:40:31,360 --> 02:40:33,460
literally because of you guys.

3717
02:40:33,700 --> 02:40:35,900
Had Season One flopped, there would've been...

3718
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:37,870
- nothing, right? - That's right.

3719
02:40:39,270 --> 02:40:42,740
So it's not just the fact that you guys laid the foundation.

3720
02:40:43,310 --> 02:40:46,270
For you guys to come back and do it again...

3721
02:40:46,380 --> 02:40:49,710
and take the risk of coming together as a crew...

3722
02:40:49,810 --> 02:40:52,950
It's really difficult to find that chemistry.

3723
02:40:53,050 --> 02:40:55,420
And you guys did it in such a short amount of time.

3724
02:40:55,720 --> 02:40:58,719
And you guys put out legendary performances.

3725
02:40:58,720 --> 02:41:01,460
Something that never gets erased from people's heads is...

3726
02:41:01,560 --> 02:41:02,689
the performance.

3727
02:41:02,690 --> 02:41:06,430
Your work, "Dream Realm..."

3728
02:41:07,100 --> 02:41:10,930
will remain in people's hearts forever.

3729
02:41:11,030 --> 02:41:13,870
It was the best work. I'm proud of you guys.

3730
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:19,740
Standing before the cold assessment of the public...

3731
02:41:19,840 --> 02:41:22,879
and going through the competition twice...

3732
02:41:22,880 --> 02:41:25,910
Seriously, I can't even imagine it.

3733
02:41:26,880 --> 02:41:28,019
(She understands the weight of their sincerity and hard work.)

3734
02:41:28,020 --> 02:41:29,650
I don't think I can go through it twice.

3735
02:41:30,750 --> 02:41:35,319
Watching you guys make it happen...

3736
02:41:35,320 --> 02:41:38,760
made me respect BUMSUP so much. You guys are amazing.

3737
02:41:39,800 --> 02:41:40,900
I applaud you guys.

3738
02:41:43,030 --> 02:41:46,199
(The fellow dancers applaud them with sincerity and support.)

3739
02:41:46,200 --> 02:41:49,170
To be honest, I didn't expect to cry.

3740
02:41:51,940 --> 02:41:55,440
(The fleeting memories make the leader, Honey J, speechless.)

3741
02:41:55,540 --> 02:41:58,080
(BUMSUP)

3742
02:41:58,180 --> 02:42:01,379
(They're in this moment together.)

3743
02:42:01,380 --> 02:42:03,490
Four years ago, we came together for the first time.

3744
02:42:05,820 --> 02:42:07,320
Through "Street Woman Fighter,"

3745
02:42:08,120 --> 02:42:10,490
we received a lot of love...

3746
02:42:11,960 --> 02:42:14,200
and built this friendship.

3747
02:42:15,330 --> 02:42:17,669
The fact that I met...

3748
02:42:17,670 --> 02:42:21,200
the members who gave me strength in this journey...

3749
02:42:22,170 --> 02:42:23,910
is enough to make me happy.

3750
02:42:25,040 --> 02:42:28,210
I'm sure the members feel the same way.

3751
02:42:29,740 --> 02:42:33,580
Even in the future, we won't settle for what we have...

3752
02:42:33,880 --> 02:42:35,580
and dance diligently.

3753
02:42:36,690 --> 02:42:38,550
So please support us...

3754
02:42:39,420 --> 02:42:41,260
and look kindly upon us.

3755
02:42:41,360 --> 02:42:43,130
Thank you for your hard work. Thank you.

3756
02:42:43,490 --> 02:42:44,490
Thank you.

3757
02:42:44,491 --> 02:42:46,359
- Thank you. - Thank you.

3758
02:42:46,360 --> 02:42:49,000
(They feel strange saying goodbye on "Street Woman Fighter.")

3759
02:42:49,930 --> 02:42:53,340
- Awesome job. It was amazing. - Thank you.

3760
02:42:53,570 --> 02:42:55,900
(Honey J, we love you.)

3761
02:42:56,810 --> 02:42:59,339
(A farewell comes more suddenly than the first meeting.)

3762
02:42:59,340 --> 02:43:00,979
- I love you all. - Aiki,

3763
02:43:00,980 --> 02:43:02,840
we need to do TikTok too.

3764
02:43:04,210 --> 02:43:05,210
Okay.

3765
02:43:05,910 --> 02:43:08,679
It's incredible that you had a baby...

3766
02:43:08,680 --> 02:43:09,749
- and you're here. - Thank you.

3767
02:43:09,750 --> 02:43:11,520
- Amazing. - Thank you.

3768
02:43:11,890 --> 02:43:13,419
Mommy is strong.

3769
02:43:13,420 --> 02:43:14,490
We love you.

3770
02:43:15,220 --> 02:43:16,260
We love you.

3771
02:43:17,630 --> 02:43:19,899
Despite the language barrier,

3772
02:43:19,900 --> 02:43:22,559
we found ourselves rooting for each other sincerely.

3773
02:43:22,560 --> 02:43:25,400
I think it's the power of dance.

3774
02:43:25,600 --> 02:43:27,640
(They met each other with vastly different colors.)

3775
02:43:27,970 --> 02:43:29,869
(Like fate, BUMSUP members met again and took on the same color.)

3776
02:43:29,870 --> 02:43:32,569
Compared to the very beginning,

3777
02:43:32,570 --> 02:43:34,509
BUMSUP members have changed a lot.

3778
02:43:34,510 --> 02:43:36,980
I was 24 then. Now, as a 28-year-old,

3779
02:43:38,310 --> 02:43:39,409
I'm back.

3780
02:43:39,410 --> 02:43:40,719
The leaders have met up often.

3781
02:43:40,720 --> 02:43:44,720
But it'll be our first time being members of the same crew.

3782
02:43:45,090 --> 02:43:46,119
I see. We'll be a team.

3783
02:43:46,120 --> 02:43:47,519
The eight of us will be a team.

3784
02:43:47,520 --> 02:43:49,359
(They worried about being on the same team.)

3785
02:43:49,360 --> 02:43:50,930
- Three! - Three! Let's go!

3786
02:43:51,230 --> 02:43:54,799
(The team name brought them together...)

3787
02:43:54,800 --> 02:43:58,569
(and they created their stories one at a time.)

3788
02:43:58,570 --> 02:44:02,699
Back in the day, we had comradeship.

3789
02:44:02,700 --> 02:44:06,810
Now, we feel like a family, not comrades.

3790
02:44:06,910 --> 02:44:08,740
I was so happy to be with them.

3791
02:44:08,840 --> 02:44:10,580
I have no regrets about my choice.

3792
02:44:11,010 --> 02:44:12,680
Although we got eliminated today,

3793
02:44:12,780 --> 02:44:16,149
I believe that the other crews will give...

3794
02:44:16,150 --> 02:44:17,890
a great ending.

3795
02:44:22,660 --> 02:44:27,860
(Team Korea, BUMSUP, goodbye!)

3796
02:44:30,830 --> 02:44:34,500
(The 3 crews' last journey for the final round will begin.)

3797
02:44:35,340 --> 02:44:38,170
It's time for the long-awaited final of World of Street Woman Fighter.

3798
02:44:39,370 --> 02:44:41,890
To decide on the final winner of World of Street Woman Fighter,

3799
02:44:41,940 --> 02:44:43,650
the Global Public Early Voting,

3800
02:44:43,750 --> 02:44:45,409
Real-Time Global Online Voting...

3801
02:44:45,410 --> 02:44:49,050
that'll take place on Mnet Plus on the day of the live finals,

3802
02:44:49,150 --> 02:44:51,589
Real-Time Text Voting,

3803
02:44:51,590 --> 02:44:54,360
and the final stage bonus points will be combined.

3804
02:44:55,390 --> 02:44:58,529
With the full version of the cheer theme,

3805
02:44:58,530 --> 02:45:00,890
each crew will give the Final Crew Cheer Theme Performance.

3806
02:45:01,460 --> 02:45:03,529
On the official channel of World of Street Woman Fighter,

3807
02:45:03,530 --> 02:45:04,969
The Choom,

3808
02:45:04,970 --> 02:45:06,369
the Global Public Early Voting...

3809
02:45:06,370 --> 02:45:08,370
for the final crews' cheer themes will take place.

3810
02:45:08,640 --> 02:45:11,710
Vote for the final winning crew now.

3811
02:45:12,510 --> 02:45:14,379
Ready? Fight!

3812
02:45:14,380 --> 02:45:17,020
(The final winner will be revealed on the live finals on July 22.)

3813
02:45:17,550 --> 02:45:22,419
(This was filmed with a smartphone.)

3814
02:45:22,420 --> 02:45:24,150
(Main section)

3815
02:45:36,730 --> 02:45:41,300
(There's flashing light, so please watch with discretion.)

3816
02:46:06,060 --> 02:46:07,900
(Sub section 1)

3817
02:46:36,090 --> 02:46:37,790
(Sub section 2)

3818
02:47:01,750 --> 02:47:03,950
(Sub section 3)

3819
02:47:31,080 --> 02:47:33,080
(Hidden section)

3820
02:48:00,880 --> 02:48:02,610
World of Street Woman Fighter.

3821
02:48:02,880 --> 02:48:05,780
With the entire world's attention on the one and only throne,

3822
02:48:06,310 --> 02:48:08,250
three crews have advanced to the finals.

3823
02:48:09,020 --> 02:48:11,690
The talented crew of female warriors that represent Australia,

3824
02:48:12,320 --> 02:48:14,890
Team Australia, AG SQUAD.

3825
02:48:15,120 --> 02:48:18,890
Now is our time to just show why we need to win.

3826
02:48:21,700 --> 02:48:24,329
The old-school hip-hop crew that represents the US,

3827
02:48:24,330 --> 02:48:26,799
Team USA, MOTIV.

3828
02:48:26,800 --> 02:48:29,139
We're one of the strongest teams.

3829
02:48:29,140 --> 02:48:32,170
So I just want to leave everything on the dance floor.

3830
02:48:35,940 --> 02:48:38,850
The strong performance crew that represents Japan,

3831
02:48:39,310 --> 02:48:41,580
Team Japan, OSAKA Ojo Gang.

3832
02:48:41,880 --> 02:48:43,319
Victory is the only thing that's left.

3833
02:48:43,320 --> 02:48:46,420
I'm the one who wants to win the most.

3834
02:48:50,430 --> 02:48:54,130
I won't make my crew give up in any situation.

3835
02:48:55,830 --> 02:48:57,730
I'm just here to win.

3836
02:48:59,700 --> 02:49:02,970
I feel very confident in who I am against anyone.

3837
02:49:03,240 --> 02:49:07,379
With me, the two best choreographers in the K-pop scene...

3838
02:49:07,380 --> 02:49:08,880
will judge the choreography.

3839
02:49:10,080 --> 02:49:11,709
- Bada. - Oh, my gosh.

3840
02:49:11,710 --> 02:49:12,850
Vata.

3841
02:49:13,450 --> 02:49:15,679
Let's go, Bada!

3842
02:49:15,680 --> 02:49:17,149
Oh, my gosh!

3843
02:49:17,150 --> 02:49:20,360
They're the two people who lead the Korean choreography scene.

3844
02:49:21,320 --> 02:49:23,989
I'm too excited about this one.

3845
02:49:23,990 --> 02:49:25,989
This is the final. So we need to...

3846
02:49:25,990 --> 02:49:27,459
give everything we got.

3847
02:49:27,460 --> 02:49:29,659
I feel really confident. We could get chosen.

3848
02:49:29,660 --> 02:49:32,399
The three crews' last dance battle...

3849
02:49:32,400 --> 02:49:34,700
for this honor will begin.

3850
02:49:36,470 --> 02:49:38,140
Ready? Fight!
