00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,830
(World of Street Woman Fighter)

2
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,939
For the first time in my life, I'm being told I can't dance.

3
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,016
(A quote from BUMSUP's Leejung in an online video on 2025.06.16)

4
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,069
(Leejung lost her edge.)

5
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,070
(Even with Leejung and Gabee, they weren't good. Tokyo won.)

6
00:00:34,071 --> 00:00:35,109
(I didn't think the Korean team's performance would fall this short.)

7
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,169
(Let's all be honest with ourselves. The result speaks for your skills.)

8
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,179
(The Korean team looked a bit stiff. Maybe the pressure was too much.)

9
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,180
(Some of the Koreans looked like they were performing K-pop.)

10
00:00:38,181 --> 00:00:39,756
(Without all the Korean pride hype, they're clearly the weakest team.)

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,180
This time, I've heard too many people say I can't dance.

12
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,250
(The World of K-pop Mission performance video was pre-released.)

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,449
(It drew a lot of attention.)

14
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,450
(It drew too much attention.)

15
00:00:49,451 --> 00:00:50,760
(We faced heavy criticism.)

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,919
(BUMSUP faced unexpected backlash and harsh reviews.)

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,929
(I'm still rooting for them, but I'm honestly disappointed.)

18
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:54,930
(It looks like everyone was too busy to really put it together.)

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:55,930
(I hate to admit it, but Korea's performance was the weakest.)

20
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:57,331
We received too many hate comments.

21
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,630
"They don't seem in sync."

22
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,939
"Their performance lacks energy compared to the other teams."

23
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,400
We were under fire the whole time.

24
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,370
It felt as if people were...

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,080
watching the video to see how weak Team Korea was.

26
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,350
I was disappointed myself over the first battle.

27
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,620
"This is disappointing."

28
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,220
"They should try harder."

29
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,820
I think we were intimidated by all the negative comments.

30
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,120
I was so sad.

31
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,459
(We received so much criticism that...)

32
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,129
(I wished we hadn't ranked first on YouTube Trending...)

33
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,930
(if it meant getting this much hate.)

34
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,499
(After being eliminated from the Main Dancer Audition)

35
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,840
To be honest, I cried a lot.

36
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
It's okay.

37
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:43,940
I really did my best and I worked hard.

38
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,310
- Don't cry. - I was devastated.

39
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,580
It felt like we weren't being taken seriously.

40
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,890
I think I just wanted some comfort.

41
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,089
While crying, I suddenly thought, "Why am I even so upset about this?"

42
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,129
Right.

43
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,030
- "I should appreciate this moment." - Yes.

44
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,660
The fact that we're close enough to the public to be...

45
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,880
openly criticized shows how engaged they are with us.

46
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,340
In a way, I think that's also love.

47
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,840
We have so many people cheering for us.

48
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,139
(BUMSUP, you got this.)

49
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,140
(Keep going strong!)

50
00:02:17,141 --> 00:02:19,109
(I'm Korean, so of course I want Team Korea to do well.)

51
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,209
(I'm on Team Korea's side no matter what.)

52
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,279
(I might be biased in favor of Team Korea, but...)

53
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,520
(I do favor Team Korea.)

54
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,826
(BUMSUP is receiving a tremendous amount of support.)

55
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,520
I think receiving unwavering support from you...

56
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,060
is the biggest blessing.

57
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,989
I was very grateful.

58
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,360
(I was very grateful.)

59
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,430
(Show them what Team Korea's got!)

60
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:40,469
So many people were showing their support for us.

61
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,699
(I'm Japanese, but I like BUMSUP's performance. I support them.)

62
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,840
For those cheering us on, we have to give a performance we're proud of.

63
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,609
I really don't want to disappoint the people...

64
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,539
who love and support us.

65
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,510
Let's own it for the sake of our team.

66
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,950
This was the first step we took as a team.

67
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,820
We've got a lot to prove.

68
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,790
We have to do well, and we will.

69
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,659
(We've endured the times together, comforting each other...)

70
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,630
(without forgetting the support we've received.)

71
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:15,829
(We represent Korea.)

72
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,440
(We're Team Korea, BUMSUP!)

73
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,210
We'll do our very best to live up to all the support you've given us.

74
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,979
World of Street Woman Fighter is powered by...

75
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,650
product sponsorship and partnership with a leading K-culture brand.

76
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,549
(A crew will be eliminated...)

77
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,419
(for the first time on World of Street Woman Fighter.)

78
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,989
(World of K-pop Mission)

79
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,419
(The Fight Judges Evaluation and...)

80
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,689
(the Global Public Evaluation will be added up.)

81
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,960
(One of the two crews will have to face the Elimination Battle.)

82
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:48,969
(Breaking technique)

83
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,970
(Waacking technique)

84
00:03:49,971 --> 00:03:51,399
(Ibuki's waacking choreography...)

85
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,499
(is something no one will be able to keep up with.)

86
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,209
(World champions, they have to strategize.)

87
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,969
(MOTIV is going to have a hard time learning this choreography.)

88
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,409
(No one will be able to do what Logistx can do.)

89
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,480
(I felt immense pressure.)

90
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,250
(It's not like that, though.)

91
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,519
Ex-ROYAL FAMILY to ROYAL FAMILY.

92
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,696
(There's an interesting dynamic.)

93
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,050
(We knew this would happen.)

94
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,119
(AG SQUAD is probably the strongest crew at our style.)

95
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,319
(I like that we got them.)

96
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,589
(Because we can do what they can do.)

97
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,966
(They're similar in a way that they become one with polyswagg.)

98
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,459
(They're the same, but they're also different.)

99
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,106
(It's so interesting to see the contrast.)

100
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,659
(The K-pop masters)

101
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,660
(They're a Japanese crew, )

102
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:21,870
(but they lead the K-pop trend.)

103
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,100
(This stage is ours.)

104
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,476
(There are so many K-pop choreographers on our team.)

105
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,599
(I'm great at K-pop.)

106
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,269
(This is K-pop.)

107
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,769
(Tonight)

108
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,779
(Either we get eliminated, )

109
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,049
(or we eliminate the other team.)

110
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,179
(We're not going to be eliminated.)

111
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,449
(No, we're not.)

112
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,280
(In this fierce survival competition, )

113
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,550
(who will be the first crew to leave World of Street Woman Fighter?)

114
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,080
(Choreography copy challenge, D-day)

115
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,190
Hello.

116
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,959
Good morning.

117
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,989
I'm excited.

118
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,159
This is a good idea.

119
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,490
Making each other's choreography.

120
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,900
We'll be able to compare.

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,260
Even if we give them a fun choreography,

122
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,129
we don't know how they will execute it.

123
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,940
- I think they'll have a hard time. - You think?

124
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,469
I don't think they'll pull off the groove.

125
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,970
(Right?)

126
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,639
There's no way.

127
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,579
No one can copy our choreography.

128
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,950
The movements will look completely different with BUMSUP.

129
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,909
We're going to win this no matter what.

130
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,656
There are so many K-pop choreographers on our team.

131
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,419
Do we seem like an easy target?

132
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,460
I watched 15 pieces of K-pop choreography that RHTokyo made.

133
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,660
But it's not like their movements are like...

134
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,560
- You startled me. - They're all...

135
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,229
You're right.

136
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,760
- They play with the rhythm. - Right.

137
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,030
That's all they do from beginning to end.

138
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,099
I feel like they'll do something like this.

139
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,970
Don't you think they'll do something like this?

140
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,970
I want to strike back hard.

141
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,009
I think Logistx will use breaking moves.

142
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,139
Yes, they were doing windmill moves yesterday.

143
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,350
- Really? - Yes, I saw them yesterday.

144
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,380
I'm just still trying to figure out how they'll be able to do...

145
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,179
what it is that you do and they cannot.

146
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,790
- They definitely can't. - Yes.

147
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,190
We were literally like, "Who can do air flares on OSAKA Ojo Gang?"

148
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,429
I don't...

149
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,860
That is so hard.

150
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,999
- She'll do like... In the middle. - Right.

151
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,830
- Yes, maybe like... - I'm sorry. I love you, Ibuki.

152
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,700
Our strategy was just implementing tricks,

153
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,410
and so I even asked two of my other girls to flip as well.

154
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,440
(Just then, Ibuki walks past MOTIV.)

155
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,810
MOTIV's floorwork seemed intense.

156
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,349
Really?

157
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,010
- Everyone's doing it? - I think so.

158
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,879
(Uwa and Junna try to spy on MOTIV.)

159
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,950
(Stopping)

160
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,020
They saw us.

161
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,319
MOTIV was practicing floor techniques.

162
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,990
Whatever it is, they definitely used something. Maybe a freeze.

163
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,360
I wonder what it could be.

164
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,270
Gosh, I am not looking forward to today.

165
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,599
I think they're going to give us...

166
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
(Something like this)

167
00:07:10,601 --> 00:07:11,640
Like that vibe.

168
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,540
Yes, it sucks.

169
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:18,209
I feel like for our one, they're going to struggle a bit.

170
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,180
Yes, it's going to be hard to imitate.

171
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,149
It's doable, but whether or not they execute it is...

172
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,250
- It's impossible. - Impossible.

173
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,880
But why won't we be able to do it?

174
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,819
Because they would obviously have been like,

175
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,560
"Let's do something they can't do."

176
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,790
Splits?

177
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,260
Let's go, guys.

178
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,789
We're going to be so positive today.

179
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,790
Period!

180
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,791
You all are going to be struggling. One of you will mess up in there.

181
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,230
Come on, girls.

182
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,599
We're going to bite back and take your point.

183
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,600
AG SQUAD, watch out.

184
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,700
I came to win.

185
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,370
It was very uncomfortable.

186
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,110
Let's just quickly practice flip.

187
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,940
Crazy.

188
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,780
They look like they're throwing something like...

189
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,450
Try your best.

190
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,119
ROYAL FAMILY heard me say "flips," and they were like...

191
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,319
(Their face went blank.)

192
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,089
They should know by now that you and I are good at tricks.

193
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,689
We always try to do it in crew works.

194
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,960
- And wow moments. - Yes.

195
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,760
I don't want to be a snob. You just can deal with it.

196
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,630
Maiya.

197
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,369
On this, stare at them directly.

198
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,370
Okay.

199
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,540
(Intense stare, ready for action)

200
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,140
We go nasty.

201
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,940
(The first match of the Choreography Exchange)

202
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,480
- I'm excited. - I'm so excited.

203
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,779
Because we have experience dancing with each other on stage,

204
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,549
we have similar styles. So I feel like we are...

205
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,219
able to execute it just as well as you girls.

206
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,260
We're the same.

207
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,060
(Show us what you got.)

208
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,330
It was so scary.

209
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,200
Kill it. Period!

210
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,330
Period!

211
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,500
Period!

212
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,140
They're similar in a way that they become one with polyswagg.

213
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,710
Who will come out on top?

214
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,970
I'm looking forward to it.

215
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,340
Have fun, guys. Let's begin the "Drama" performance.

216
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,649
The song is slow...

217
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,019
because it is "Drama."

218
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,119
We wanted to bring drama to the song.

219
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,190
The goal is to make it as hard as possible.

220
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,549
ROYAL FAMILY. They're so crew.

221
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,889
And if we try and go like this with the same flavor,

222
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,190
that's not going to mix.

223
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:19,830
We are utilizing the skills...

224
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,400
that we have. That AG SQUAD has, but they don't.

225
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,770
And if you don't replicate it the best you can,

226
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,269
you don't get as many points as each other.

227
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,469
It's what we expected.

228
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,040
I think we knew that they were going to pull out flexibles.

229
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,610
Also, make sure they stretch...

230
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,320
because they're doing a lot of tricks.

231
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,090
Let's go. Everyone ready?

232
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,820
(What choreography did AG SQUAD prepare for the copy section?)

233
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,199
We made it sexy with tricks.

234
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,000
And it's real body control.

235
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,299
It was pretty easy for us to pick up.

236
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,740
A pretty intricate routine.

237
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,070
She did a little kick too.

238
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,380
We know that not all of ROYAL FAMILY can do this sort of stuff.

239
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,520
We have a lot of girls who can do the skills.

240
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,849
(AG SQUAD's choreography copy challenge ends.)

241
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,090
We weren't surprised.

242
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,019
I'm not worried at all.

243
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,959
So, once again, this is choreography,

244
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,529
not gymnastics.

245
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,730
Pretty easy, and I appreciate the girls for...

246
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,500
making it easy.

247
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,370
It looks easy but it's not.

248
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,640
Kaea is a performer. Especially in the part "drama."

249
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,310
- Let's go. - Let's go!

250
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,149
Our choreography copy section is hard enough.

251
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,649
I think we make it different.

252
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,619
Ours is more complex and more complicated.

253
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:53,019
Not being able to properly execute the moves and perform...

254
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,029
like how it should be performed.

255
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,429
I do know whatever they bring would be good.

256
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,199
It would be really good.

257
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,629
Time to show...

258
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:04,339
the new gen is just as strong as the old gen.

259
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,540
(What choreography copy section did ROYAL FAMILY make?)

260
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,309
Very polyswagg style.

261
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,310
It is easy.

262
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:15,679
They're surely Gen Z.

263
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,110
It was disappointing.

264
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,119
AG SQUAD not being able to properly...

265
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,549
execute the moves and perform it...

266
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,360
like how it should be performed.

267
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,190
We can do that.

268
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,099
We know this type of style.

269
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,829
I do feel like it's the best thing for me and my body and AG SQUAD.

270
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:40,300
AG SQUAD will execute the essence of it.

271
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,140
That's tough.

272
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,180
BUMSUP's.

273
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,609
(Confident)

274
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,649
- Leader. - Okay. But they're Korean.

275
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,449
They're K-pop...

276
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,020
Exciting.

277
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,559
I'm excited. I'm curious what they prepared.

278
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,420
- Right. - I'm curious.

279
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,389
You'll be able to see that this is what K-pop is.

280
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,629
She says they'll show what K-pop is.

281
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,430
- They're the original. - Right.

282
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,769
Korea is very good at K-pop.

283
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,199
It's what my crew members are very good at.

284
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,410
I'm not worried at all.

285
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,770
Our choreography...

286
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,379
is very detailed.

287
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,179
All eight members are making a different shape.

288
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,719
We do it smoothly,

289
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,990
but there are lots of details in it.

290
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,289
Even if Rie Hata or whoever comes against us,

291
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,920
I'm very confident.

292
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,530
K-pop?

293
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,430
It's my expertise.

294
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,759
I'm confident.

295
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,360
It wouldn't be easy to copy.

296
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,869
They really like the one-line formation.

297
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,710
I really don't know what they're trying to do.

298
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,409
It's a battle of creativity.

299
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,240
Who doesn't know we all dance well here?

300
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,740
I think we'll make a new picture.

301
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,049
(What would be BUMSUP's choreography challenge?)

302
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,480
(Amazed)

303
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,920
How can she dance like that?

304
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,789
It would be nice to work with Orientalism.

305
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,860
It didn't stick in my memory.

306
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,760
Detailed facial expressions.

307
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,759
How will you do this?

308
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,330
Make it work on your own.

309
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,870
They'll break it.

310
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,199
(BUMSUP's choreography copy challenge ends.)

311
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,569
When I first saw it, I couldn't tell who made the choreography.

312
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,079
It was a choreography that anyone could do.

313
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,010
I could memorize it after seeing it once.

314
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,609
You don't need to like it.

315
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,920
I like it.

316
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,549
I have come to like that kind of dancing.

317
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,590
For the 15 years I've worked in this profession...

318
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,319
BTS, G-DRAGON,

319
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,029
ZICO, PSY, CL, BABYMONSTER, BoA,

320
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,789
TAEYONG, Red Velvet, aespa, Eunhyuk, EXO,

321
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,229
NCT, TWICE, Stray Kids, KATSEYE.

322
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,399
I have the experience I have accumulated over the many years.

323
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,639
In one sentence, I'm good at K-pop.

324
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,169
We'll show it to you well.

325
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,870
I'm excited to see this.

326
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,309
In the choreography style of Rie Hata so far,

327
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,409
she was somehow very busy.

328
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,249
She has to find something.

329
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,649
Like this.

330
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:07,749
Jennie, Jennie

331
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,850
(Laughing)

332
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,819
A groove that can't be easily copied.

333
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,159
Whatever they bring,

334
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,190
we'll do beyond that.

335
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
(Focusing)

336
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:20,681
(What would RHTokyo's copy section choreography be?)

337
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,340
Would they remember what they see?

338
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,500
I honestly don't know.

339
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,740
It's a style we commonly see.

340
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,579
Rico will show it in a cool way.

341
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,580
(Rico comes forward.)

342
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,979
I don't think they'll be able to copy it.

343
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,079
It's not that easy.

344
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,750
It's quite easy. It's fine.

345
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,680
(Powerful moves)

346
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,050
(RHTokyo's choreography copy challenge ends.)

347
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:45,419
Rico's nasty.

348
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,390
She's so good.

349
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,789
Rie might be the only one...

350
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,359
who can make that groove.

351
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,200
I'm just happy we're not against them.

352
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,299
That comes with so much strength and technique.

353
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,969
I don't know if they could do that.

354
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,109
- You think Gabee can do that? - No.

355
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,210
I can do even better.

356
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,309
Go on and try.

357
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,909
It's very simple but also very complex.

358
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,279
I can't help but win.

359
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,279
There weren't many routines compared to ours.

360
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,749
I don't think we'll have a problem.

361
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,319
I'm excited to see this one.

362
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,590
So excited.

363
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,390
They have two different styles.

364
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,360
(The two crews have different styles.)

365
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,130
(The peak of waacking and street, OSAKA Ojo Gang)

366
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,370
(The representative of the original American hip-hop, MOTIV)

367
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,069
Let's go!

368
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,770
Let's go!

369
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,409
- Let's go! - Let's go!

370
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,980
This will be really fun.

371
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,540
- It would be really fun. - Exciting.

372
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,280
(Lifting)

373
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,279
I'm scared and I'm not versing them.

374
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,420
(Amazing)

375
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,789
We actually made it really easy.

376
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,889
We made it easy.

377
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,160
You're lying.

378
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,990
You're lying!

379
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,430
(A serious face)

380
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,459
If you guys are good dancers,

381
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,200
I'm pretty sure you guys can make it.

382
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,170
(That was strong.)

383
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,700
She said they could do it if they were good dancers.

384
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,940
Ojo?

385
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,210
Ojo?

386
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,239
More like, "Oh, no."

387
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,580
(Ojo? More like, "Oh, no.")

388
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,779
Oh no.

389
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,320
She said, "Ojo? More like, 'Oh, no.'"

390
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,050
- OSAKA Oh No Gang. - OSAKA Oh No Gang.

391
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,420
That was annoying.

392
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,260
They really say everything.

393
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,690
We dodged a bullet.

394
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,990
A big bullet from both of them.

395
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,299
We're happy we're not versing them.

396
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,530
I'm excited. Let's do this!

397
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,070
(Glaring)

398
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,069
We had Part A, so we were going to go first.

399
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,769
It was very important how difficult...

400
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,690
the choreography we were going to give them was.

401
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,209
We know. We know what you're going to do.

402
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,130
I just keep thinking they're going to use Ibuki.

403
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,449
She's going to boast of her waacking.

404
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,949
It sounds like they have tutting and waacking sections.

405
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,919
Waacking is the only thing they can't do.

406
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,329
Hip-hop comes from the heart,

407
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,689
but waacking needs more thought,

408
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,999
and it's a dance in which you put together many parts like a puzzle.

409
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,530
I think it would be nice to make MOTIV try it out.

410
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,370
Come on, Ibuki. Let's go, Waacking Queen.

411
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,170
(What's OSAKA Ojo Gang's copy section choreography?)

412
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,940
(Waacking start.)

413
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,610
The waacking part that no one can copy.

414
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,450
When I watched it, I wasn't surprised by what they created.

415
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,690
I don't think anyone can copy it right away.

416
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,019
I'm trying to get it right away. I got you.

417
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,760
I think we're more like K-pop.

418
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,929
(Is this real?)

419
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,140
Period.

420
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,739
MOTIV would struggle to copy this.

421
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,540
They have so much intricate... So much.

422
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,210
So much choreography.

423
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,179
They don't do waacking.

424
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,880
It would be difficult to copy it perfectly.

425
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,690
I don't think they can do it.

426
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,389
When Ojo Gang watches our copy section,

427
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,619
they're going to feel stressed.

428
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,460
I think they'll put Logistx's breaking and acrobatic moves.

429
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,899
I cannot lie. I am pretty confident...

430
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,340
no one will be able to do what Logan can do.

431
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,370
That's interesting.

432
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,209
Who wants to do that?

433
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,510
That's us in Season One.

434
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,109
(Leejung put a breaking dance in the choreography copy section.)

435
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,079
(Goodness. How will they do that?)

436
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,556
(Hyojin Choi was the leader of the opponent crew.)

437
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,679
It's fun when it's not my job to do.

438
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,820
Right.

439
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,850
That's going to be really bad for them.

440
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,360
I'll add a really high-level combo.

441
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:43,660
(What would MOTIV's copy section choreography be?)

442
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,170
(What did I just see?)

443
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,280
It's what I had expected.

444
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,179
And if you have to copy exactly,

445
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,609
you have to be a B-girl.

446
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,219
It was very hip-hop.

447
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,050
I was happy I could do it.

448
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,460
- Logan. - Spicy.

449
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,289
(Smiling)

450
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,659
(They all rise up.)

451
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,959
(I want to do it.)

452
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,159
Would anyone be able to do that?

453
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,430
That's really crazy.

454
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,499
Even if I do easy stuff,

455
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,000
I don't think they can pick it up.

456
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,139
As far as creating something impossible to copy,

457
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,710
they definitely didn't do that.

458
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,210
Good luck.

459
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,639
Ojo?

460
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,550
More like, "Oh, no."

461
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,580
It's what we expected.

462
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,150
It was what I expected.

463
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,620
I think we won at this point.

464
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,320
What if they bring real breaking?

465
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,920
Hana can do the back tumbling.

466
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,559
Hana could also do some back tumbling...

467
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,530
and acrobatic moves.

468
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,729
If it's a move that goes from a roundoff to a back tumble,

469
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,070
I'll do my best.

470
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,100
Are you ready to break your knees?

471
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,670
I'll take care of the knees.

472
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,710
Difficult skills? I'm confident.

473
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,640
Good.

474
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,279
We can win this.

475
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,339
(They're relaxed.)

476
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,309
Of course, I respect them.

477
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,549
It was very hip,

478
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,420
and it was very much like MOTIV.

479
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,450
But I think...

480
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:16,920
we'll win in this mission.

481
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,800
(All 6 crews are here.)

482
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,129
(Kyoka shows something to signal her arrival.)

483
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,639
(Should I tie it up?)

484
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,740
(Yes.)

485
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:34,870
Or a bandana?

486
00:20:34,871 --> 00:20:36,040
A bandana would be cute too.

487
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,240
Bandana.

488
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,280
A cap for the battle, right?

489
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,279
(We won't have the cap today.)

490
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,909
Honestly, I'm confident.

491
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,980
The difference in the number of views was over 200,000.

492
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,089
As far as our views being the lowest out of everyone,

493
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:54,790
I feel like we're just all prepared to battle.

494
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,960
We're second in the views.

495
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,129
Likes were hidden from the public.

496
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,029
We couldn't see the number.

497
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,770
But I bet it was a lot.

498
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,700
And we're going to find that out today.

499
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,669
(AG SQUAD has lower views than ROYAL FAMILY.)

500
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,739
(A different air fills their Agit.)

501
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,009
They were expected to have more views...

502
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,379
because they have been together...

503
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,050
The company has been together for more than 15 to 20 years.

504
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,019
(She finds something.)

505
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,019
Why do you look so guilty today?

506
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,689
Do you know?

507
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,990
Are you sad? Are we going to lose?

508
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,260
So we are battling.

509
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,660
We're not battling. We're winning.

510
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,499
ROYAL FAMILY already has their fan base,

511
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,499
so that's views they're going to get automatically.

512
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,769
People are going to want to see what they're doing.

513
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,069
(Well...)

514
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,140
I don't know.

515
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,300
We should win.

516
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,440
We should win.

517
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,940
But if we don't, we're ready to battle.

518
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,389
(Elimination Battle)

519
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,950
(The place to hold the fierce elimination battles for survival!)

520
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,230
(Which crew will be eliminated first?)

521
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,340
(MOTIV enters the fight zone.)

522
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,270
Goodness.

523
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,470
It's a boxing ring.

524
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,409
We're really fighting out here.

525
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,440
This is huge.

526
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,879
There was a big boxing ring in the middle.

527
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,579
I'm just envisioning myself in the ring.

528
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,979
Mentally preparing for this battle.

529
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,789
No thoughts. Just battle.

530
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,660
That's it. I don't want to go home.

531
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,790
- Good morning. - Good morning.

532
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,529
- Good? - Good.

533
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,660
Hey.

534
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,829
The energy is definitely weird in that space.

535
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,399
Even Ojo Gang, when they walked past us,

536
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,969
they obviously were very friendly, like, "What's up? What's good?"

537
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,009
But people were just like, "I'm ready to go."

538
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,010
- It's a real match. - It's a real match.

539
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,909
I was very calm.

540
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:58,520
I want to think we won't be doing the Elimination Battle.

541
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,779
I think BUMSUP knew they were winning.

542
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:04,120
They were definitely the most confident in that space.

543
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,019
We may have the most views,

544
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,860
but I think we can be confident...

545
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,090
in this mission.

546
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,329
(What is she saying...)

547
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,799
(suddenly?)

548
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,169
I don't want people to take it the wrong way.

549
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,439
Who took it the wrong way?

550
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,939
I'm saying this just in case.

551
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,910
I think I would have.

552
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,409
(Thinking)

553
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,339
I think this is the last mission...

554
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,009
we could get people's attention with likes.

555
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,450
(RH Tokyo enters the fight zone.)

556
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,149
How are the views?

557
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,470
- We're overwhelmingly ahead. - We have double the number.

558
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,220
We would have more likes.

559
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:42,359
Three million views is an amazing thing.

560
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,389
Still,

561
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,459
there were comments like,

562
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,029
"I came to press a like for BUMSUP,"

563
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,869
"but after seeing RH Tokyo's dance, I liked that better,"

564
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,200
"so I'll change my vote to RH Tokyo."

565
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,710
I'm excited because I think the fans will spread out.

566
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:00,709
I don't think anyone realizes how scary it is being in that room.

567
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,279
You know, we could be sent home.

568
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,210
We'll be fighting here.

569
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,650
So we're battling.

570
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,020
- What? - Goodness.

571
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,590
What?

572
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,060
(Laughing)

573
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,660
I don't really care.

574
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,030
(Laughing)

575
00:24:18,031 --> 00:24:22,799
We're hoping to give something exciting and fresh and new.

576
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,000
I think they'll really like ours.

577
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,770
No. It's all right. Just leave it.

578
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,639
(The 6 crews are all in the fight zone.)

579
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,540
Hello. I'm Sung Han Bin, the host of World of Street Woman Fighter.

580
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,010
- Hello. - Hello.

581
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,680
- Hello. - Hi.

582
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,249
Today will be the day when,

583
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,249
among the six crews representing their nations,

584
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:46,190
the first crew will be eliminated.

585
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,390
No.

586
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,730
It's scary.

587
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,259
Before even getting a chance to prove their skills,

588
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,429
one crew will have to leave this stage,

589
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,330
carrying the humiliating title...

590
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,550
of being the weakest and the first to be eliminated.

591
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,270
That's crazy.

592
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,009
Worst crew.

593
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:05,709
The final score for World of K-pop Mission,

594
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,010
which will seal the fate of the first eliminated crew,

595
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,956
is calculated by combining the Fight Judge scores,

596
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,319
Global Public Evaluation,

597
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,189
and their previous...

598
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,320
Class Mission scores.

599
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,429
The views, the likes, the judges, and the 50 points.

600
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,789
(AG SQUAD's Class Mission points: plus 50)

601
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,700
We could have had 100.

602
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,970
It's better than minus 50.

603
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,130
Smile.

604
00:25:30,131 --> 00:25:31,376
(BUMSUP's Class Mission points: minus 50)

605
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,670
It's not funny at all.

606
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,309
The crew currently in the lead...

607
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,209
is RH Tokyo.

608
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,279
(RH Tokyo's Class Mission points: plus 100)

609
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,640
The Fight Judge score...

610
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,150
is out of 100 points per crew.

611
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,749
If all three judges give a perfect score,

612
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:50,519
a crew can earn up to a maximum of 300 points.

613
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,959
The Global Public Evaluation...

614
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,429
is ranked by the score that combines...

615
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,299
the number of views and likes, multiplied by 100.

616
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:02,129
Votes were counted via "The CHOOM," the official WSWF account...

617
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:05,969
from March 25 to 29, until 6 pm.

618
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:09,910
The strongest crew in the view count competition...

619
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,509
with an impressive 3,204,705 views,

620
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,510
is BUMSUP.

621
00:26:14,511 --> 00:26:16,380
That's amazing. Three million.

622
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,780
Three million is crazy.

623
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:22,720
The top viewed video. They just said BUMSUP.

624
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,850
Why aren't they smiling?

625
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,689
However, views and likes...

626
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,690
aren't necessarily proportional.

627
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,829
- We know. - Having the most views...

628
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,669
doesn't mean having the most likes.

629
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,099
- We know. - I had low views...

630
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,569
in Season One,

631
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:43,939
but I won because of the likes.

632
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,039
So we can't be happy...

633
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,440
just because we have lots of views.

634
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,480
We have three million. It should be high.

635
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,879
We have three million views, but what if we don't get many likes?

636
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,879
No way. There's the basic number.

637
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,920
That can't happen.

638
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,589
Right.

639
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,389
That's why the number of likes...

640
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,089
will be the critical factor...

641
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,430
in the Global Public Evaluation score.

642
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,030
- We'll battle. - MOTIV.

643
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,259
The World of K-pop Mission...

644
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,029
is a battle between two crews.

645
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,799
The three crews that lose the battles...

646
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,470
become elimination candidates.

647
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,669
Among the three elimination candidate crews,

648
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,709
two crews with low points...

649
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,779
will have an elimination battle...

650
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,850
that decides the first crew to be eliminated.

651
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,149
- I'm scared. - Your hands are freezing.

652
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,179
(Holding)

653
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:30,289
Now, I'll announce the final results...

654
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:32,489
of the World of K-pop Mission matchups,

655
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:36,890
which will decide the first crew to be eliminated.

656
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,360
Ready.

657
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,230
Fight!

658
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,369
- All right. Let's do it. - Hi.

659
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,669
(Following Mike Song's appearance, )

660
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,899
- I'm excited. - I am too.

661
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,139
(the special judges of World of K-pop Mission make an appearance.)

662
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,940
(Welcome)

663
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,709
(Welcome)

664
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,579
(Beyonce's lead backup dancer and dance captain)

665
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,139
(Worked with global artists like Usher, Jennifer Lopez, )

666
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,349
(Neyo, and Ciara.)

667
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,349
(The global dance icon, Ashley Everett)

668
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,979
I think K-pop is really good.

669
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,389
It reminds me more of my technical days...

670
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,919
because it's so precise.

671
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,989
So I don't think everyone can do it.

672
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,460
(And another special judge)

673
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,799
(The main choreographer of 1MILLION, a global dance academy)

674
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,799
(Back Koo Young, the trendsetter for K-pop choreography)

675
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,799
(He participated in "Street Man Fighter.")

676
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,599
K-pop choreography...

677
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,909
is made to be shown to the public.

678
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,139
I think I place more focus...

679
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,579
on how it could be loved.

680
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,709
I'm excited.

681
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,350
The lineup is crazy.

682
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,549
Right?

683
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,949
Now, I'll announce the final results...

684
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,919
of the World of K-pop Mission matchups,

685
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:39,020
which will decide the first crew to be eliminated.

686
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,620
Wait.

687
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:43,460
My heart is beating.

688
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,559
I'll announce the results...

689
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,629
for MOTIV and OSAKA Ojo Gang.

690
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:52,040
It's here.

691
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,200
Let's go.

692
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,810
First, the Class Mission scores will be revealed.

693
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,180
(MOTIV versus OSAKA Ojo Gang)

694
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,380
It starts from zero.

695
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,350
We have the same score.

696
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,179
The scores of the Fight Judges Evaluation...

697
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,749
and the Global Public Evaluation have not been revealed yet.

698
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,859
Even though we have the lowest views,

699
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,859
there were a lot of people encouraging us.

700
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,789
We don't deserve to lose again.

701
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,129
At this point, there’s about...

702
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:23,829
a 200,000-view difference.

703
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,499
The results of the World of K-pop Mission.

704
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,840
Honestly, I'm confident.

705
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,639
One, two, three, four, go.

706
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,839
Five, six, go, seven, eight.

707
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,840
Whose part are you doing?

708
00:29:33,841 --> 00:29:35,309
I'm Ruu, she's Hana.

709
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,579
- You're Junna? - Yes.

710
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,880
Yes. So come here.

711
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,480
(MOTIV practices smoothly.)

712
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,879
Seven eight.

713
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,089
MOTIV crew's method is Marlee taking the lead...

714
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:46,860
and working more together as a unit.

715
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,460
At the end of the day, it's a group challenge.

716
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,700
I have been the leader of the MOTIV crew for nine years.

717
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,130
We're more united in what we do.

718
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,870
(This is the teamwork of a crew that's been together for 9 years.)

719
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,139
- Amazing. - They're already practicing.

720
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,140
Right.

721
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,469
(We nailed it.)

722
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,350
(They're done practicing for the copy section.)

723
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,479
(Already?)

724
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,480
(Kaidi checks how OSAKA Ojo Gang is practicing.)

725
00:30:06,481 --> 00:30:08,880
They're in their own world doing something different.

726
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,980
They're not ready.

727
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,980
(They're practicing separately.)

728
00:30:10,981 --> 00:30:13,520
Our crew started practicing separately.

729
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,490
Some watched MOTIV's clip and memorized the moves.

730
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,319
Like Ruu and Minani,

731
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,229
there are members who are good at directing and choreographing.

732
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:25,460
"You'll make the first part and you'll make the second part."

733
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,060
Everyone was focusing on different parts.

734
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,546
(OSAKA Ojo Gang divides the work to make use of everyone's strength.)

735
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:34,670
They are stronger apart than they are together.

736
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,516
(The two crew have different practicing styles.)

737
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,410
The legs go one, two, three.

738
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:39,610
(They start practicing together.)

739
00:30:39,611 --> 00:30:41,309
(Kyoka teaches them MOTIV's choreography section.)

740
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,450
One, two, three.

741
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,380
(Easy, right?)

742
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,350
(Slipping)

743
00:30:46,351 --> 00:30:48,250
- My legs hurt. - It hurts.

744
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:53,560
The hip-hop choreography wasn't so hard to me,

745
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:56,390
but the other members found it hard.

746
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,289
(Creaking)

747
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,936
- You should put your feet together. - Okay.

748
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,570
(They're still struggling.)

749
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,199
(Like this!)

750
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,570
This is a beginner's class.

751
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
Seriously.

752
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:10,440
Is this your first time dancing?

753
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,980
(OSAKA Ojo Gang is struggling from the beginning.)

754
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,686
(Meanwhile, MOTIV is practicing the newly made choreography.)

755
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,710
(They're curious.)

756
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,010
We're almost there!

757
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,310
(Almost there?)

758
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,879
It bothered me.

759
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,879
(OSAKA Ojo Gang is learning the part Minami made.)

760
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,890
Move.

761
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,889
(Struggling)

762
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,820
(Their learning speed is different.)

763
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,690
This is too Minami's World.

764
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:32,799
It's like there's a challenge within our crew.

765
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,359
Everyone's learning waacking,

766
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,129
everyone's learning Minami's hip-hop,

767
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:38,329
and everyone's learning Kyoka's hip-hop.

768
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,470
The members have to learn all that.

769
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,270
Everyone dances in a different style,

770
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:45,069
so if I put in too many things,

771
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,609
the members who've never tried that genre...

772
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:51,979
find it hard to dance.

773
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,550
There was no middle ground.

774
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,289
MOTIV crew on three.

775
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,319
One, two, three.

776
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,520
- MOTIV crew! - MOTIV crew!

777
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,990
We got this!

778
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,736
- Are they done? - They're done.

779
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,760
That's amazing.

780
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,460
Don't feel rushed.

781
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,869
Let's do it step by step.

782
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,390
- Let's start from this point. - Okay.

783
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:14,770
(OSAKA Ojo Gang practices until late in the night.)

784
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:15,909
Let's do it one more time.

785
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,209
- One more time? - Okay.

786
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,680
- One more time. - Okay.

787
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,279
There will be no breaks.

788
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,880
I can keep going forever.

789
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:25,150
(The final rehearsal day of World of K-pop Mission)

790
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,580
I thought they'd have some weak parts.

791
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,389
(How would MOTIV perform at the rehearsal?)

792
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,859
(The choreography copy section starts.)

793
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,720
Maybe better than Ojo.

794
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,289
(Great teamwork)

795
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,290
Good.

796
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,659
(They get through the difficult waacking section.)

797
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,130
They've become very relaxed.

798
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:43,430
(They mastered the choreography copy section.)

799
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:44,970
Don't joke with me.

800
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,370
They're copying us.

801
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:51,109
We invested so many hours in the copy section.

802
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:54,410
But MOTIV mastered it within several hours.

803
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,679
MOTIV has really good teamwork.

804
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,880
- They're good. - It's on sync.

805
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,850
We'd lose at this rate.

806
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,390
(The final rehearsal ends.)

807
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,289
(It's OSAKA Ojo Gang's turn.)

808
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:09,236
The two crews who stayed up the longest yesterday.

809
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,589
I wonder if they got any sleep.

810
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,759
(All the crews know they practiced all night.)

811
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,760
We can do it.

812
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,400
(How would OSAKA Ojo Gang perform in the rehearsal?)

813
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,300
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's choreography copy section)

814
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,840
Right. Ibuki.

815
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,140
When I watched Ojo Gang,

816
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,549
(They bend at different times.)

817
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,010
they definitely weren't as clean.

818
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,950
They weren't as prepared to perform it as a unit.

819
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,390
(They almost bumped.)

820
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,920
That was so close to the other girl's foot.

821
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,066
(Logistx's breaking part was substituted with another move.)

822
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,860
I don't think they executed the copy part.

823
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,659
(Even in the tumbling section with two turns, )

824
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,069
(they make one turn.)

825
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,529
Copy section alone...

826
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,070
is a sign that we beat them.

827
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,510
(Gasping)

828
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,310
I made a big mistake.

829
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,656
(This is a part where they all move forward together...)

830
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,780
(and then Ibuki goes under their legs.)

831
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:06,450
It was the worst experience in my life.

832
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,319
After watching Ojo Gang,

833
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,449
that brought me a little sense of relief.

834
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:12,459
(Laughing)

835
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,020
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's rehearsal ends after a big mistake.)

836
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,160
We were in trouble.

837
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,759
It was serious.

838
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,899
(I'm not laughing.)

839
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,359
It's clear.

840
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,430
We can see their weak teamwork.

841
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,670
They weren't a crew,

842
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:27,270
so they need to find a style that they can do together.

843
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,240
That's really difficult.

844
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,940
(Will OSAKA Ojo Gang be able to overcome the crisis?)

845
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,540
I had to do more work, right?

846
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,380
- Yes. - You can add your triplet.

847
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,280
All right. What did we get to see?

848
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,150
(After the final rehearsal, they rewatched the performances...)

849
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,496
(and held a vote for each matchup to predict which crew would win.)

850
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,520
(MOTIV got the voting results.)

851
00:34:43,521 --> 00:34:46,490
RH Tokyo. MOTIV wins.

852
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,930
- A win, MOTIV. - Fine.

853
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:53,100
BUMSUP. Ojo Gang won.

854
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,560
They voted for Ojo Gang?

855
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,169
ROYAL FAMILY. Ojo Gang.

856
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,270
So we're 50-50.

857
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,240
Okay.

858
00:35:00,241 --> 00:35:01,739
I was so confused.

859
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,869
At this part, I don't know.

860
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,239
They messed up the whole copy section.

861
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,710
They definitely weren't as clean.

862
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,939
I feel like we did a lot more,

863
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,510
and it was 50-50.

864
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:12,219
Reading that some people voted for Ojo...

865
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,649
was just kind of like a wakeup call in that...

866
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,450
we have to come even harder.

867
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:19,020
Feedback. "Needed more K-pop energy."

868
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,389
MOTIV. They were clean, but...

869
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,860
It's not giving K-pop.

870
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,490
It's not giving K-pop.

871
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:27,129
If you think it being a K-pop mission,

872
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:29,430
- I think Ojo Gang was more... - Right.

873
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,930
K-pop energy and vibes?

874
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,440
What does that mean?

875
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,900
(K-pop energy...)

876
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,139
(What is that?)

877
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,439
Can you name a few K-pop artists that you know?

878
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,610
BTS.

879
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,579
(And?)

880
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,049
- Only BTS? - Wait.

881
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,579
(Let me think.)

882
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,019
I'm nervous.

883
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,620
Other crews are more familiar with K-pop music.

884
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,360
What does K-pop energy require?

885
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,120
This is what I'm thinking.

886
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:59,459
We're girls. So they want us to have a cutesy vibe?

887
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,559
Okay, but if you look at Ojo Gang...

888
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,630
(Am I cute?)

889
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:06,039
(They were too powerful to say they were cute.)

890
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,939
The one thing that they have we aren't doing...

891
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,839
- is they do kind of have solo... - Solo.

892
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,440
But ROYAL FAMILY didn't have solo moments.

893
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,426
(The definition of K-pop energy is back to being mysterious.)

894
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,879
Can we go back to...

895
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,420
- Dancing? Yes. - Yes.

896
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,349
I went on ChatGPT.

897
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:25,689
K-pop idols are known for dancing like a single unit.

898
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,720
- Aren't we clean? - We got that.

899
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:31,459
(MOTIV has strong unity with years of mega crew experience.)

900
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,099
Fusion of dance styles.

901
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,369
K-pop choreography blends various dance styles, including hip-hop,

902
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:38,270
urban dance, b-boying.

903
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,499
We do that. We do hip-hop.

904
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,309
(Group dances with hip-hop vibes and breaking performances)

905
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:45,070
K-pop performers dance with their faces. We can do that.

906
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,939
(They already mastered fun and witty expressions.)

907
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,640
Then you are K-pop!

908
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,649
I am K-pop!

909
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:51,680
What's your K-pop?

910
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,819
(That's right.)

911
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,519
(How did MOTIV define K-pop?)

912
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,089
I'm still learning what K-pop vibe is,

913
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,520
but the K-pop dance is dance.

914
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,260
If it's fun, I can just have fun.

915
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,660
Ours don't look like the standard K-pop performance.

916
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,000
That doesn't necessarily mean that we're not giving you K-pop.

917
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,630
It's just hip-hop K-pop.

918
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,339
We're not going to change how we dance...

919
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,210
because we're MOTIV crew.

920
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,269
(Let's watch MOTIV's performance that stuck to their style.)

921
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,040
World of K-pop Mission.

922
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,140
Let's watch the video of the crews...

923
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:25,009
who battled to G-DRAGON's mission song.

924
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,820
We're going to watch it.

925
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,820
MOTIV's skill level is so high.

926
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,319
- I'm excited. - So excited.

927
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,059
- The breaking too? - Yes.

928
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,629
- She did the breaking and tumbling? - Yes.

929
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:38,059
I'm going to show the energy that we bring,

930
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,829
and I'm going to make anyone watching...

931
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,160
truly feel us.

932
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,270
I can't wait. I'm so excited.

933
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,099
Go, girls. Go, queen.

934
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,140
Let's go.

935
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,570
That's pretty.

936
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,280
(Laughing)

937

("Good Boy," "Power," "Home Sweet Home" by G-DRAGON)

938
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,520
This part is so fascinating.

939
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,070
This is Ojo Gang's choreography.

940
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,370
Okay.

941
00:38:19,371 --> 00:38:20,600
Ibuki gave them that?

942
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,639
Maybe better than Ojo Gang.

(OSAKA Ojo Gang's choreography section)

944
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,610
It's really fascinating again.

945
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,080
(They're good.)

946
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:37,219
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's choreography section)

947
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,290
It's so fascinating.

948
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,360
I like this part.

949
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,760
(Great expression)

950
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:49,769
(Smiling)

951
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:51,470
I love it.

952
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,670
Let's go!

953
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,910
Let's go, Logan!

954
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:04,410
How does she even dance so well?

955
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,220
That's cool.

956
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,220
Swag.

957
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,590
Hey, ladies.

958

Good boy

960
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,480
She's so good at the performance.

961
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,150
I love it. I love this.

962
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,889
Let's go!

963
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,649

00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,919

Logistx did it all.

982
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,070
They're enjoying it.

983
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,869
They're so good.

984
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,839
- Let's go! - Let's go!

985
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,179
They're like doing what the music is sounding them to do.

986
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,940
You know, which is very American.

987
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:46,650
It looks just like MOTIV style, which they usually do.

988
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,649
- They seem to be enjoying it. - They look like they're having fun.

989

- Fantaye! - Let's go!

990
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,520
- Yes! - Go!

991
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,630

Let's go!

994

They look happy.

995
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,449
MOTIV, we're just going to do really well in this challenge.

996
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:25,489
I wasn't nervous after watching MOTIV's video.

997
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:27,689
I do not know what this is about to look like.

998
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,760
I'm scared.

999
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:33,130
- I'm scared. - Peekaboo.

1000
00:41:33,131 --> 00:41:34,800
(Peekaboo)

1001
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:38,170
My face is... No, please.

1002
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,700
The close-ups. No. Why?

1003
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,539
(Femme fatale)

1004
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,180
(Laughing at a fatally attractive ending)

1005
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,540
They're laughing out loud.

1006
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:50,179
Are those ending scenes only in Korea?

1007
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,780
- Yes, only we do those things. - I see.

1008
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,179
(Mellow)

1009
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,449
(Embarrassed)

1010
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:57,219
(Innocent)

1011
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:00,519
(Last blow)

1012
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,520
(Panicked by the first experience in the ending scene)

1013
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:03,230
- No. - We didn't say anything.

1014
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,030
- But they know. - Oh, my. I'm so nervous.

1015
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,100
We did not know about this.

1016
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:13,269
The close-up shots at the end were so bad.

1017
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:15,569
I don't even think I was looking at the camera at that point.

1018
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,869
Oh, my gosh. This is so embarrassing.

1019
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,410
Next time?

1020
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,239
(Thinking)

1021
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,750
I'll be an ending fairy.

1022
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,690
MOTIV. Groove.

1023
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:35,389
I felt MOTIV has...

1024
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:38,259
a more relaxed...

1025
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,529
and mature vibe.

1026
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:44,829
I think they look awesome overall with their grooviness.

1027
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:49,969
But it didn't feel like a K-pop performance fully to me.

1028
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:52,009
(Agreed)

1029
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:53,379
I get it.

1030
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,880
And they were doing what they would naturally do,

1031
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,780
instead of having a K-pop mentality.

1032
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:01,980
It seems they were relying...

1033
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:05,089
on Logistx's breakdancing...

1034
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:08,189
for their wow moment.

1035
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,929
I think that was just a genius move.

1036
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:12,999
I feel like, literally, you want to beat the other person.

1037
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,059
Incorporating breakdancing into K-pop,

1038
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,069
knowing that they have super-strength.

1039
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:19,539
You have to know your opponent's weaknesses and your strengths...

1040
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,640
and play to that.

1041
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,969
Okay. We have to do it.

1042
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,240
This is hard.

1043
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,910
(How many points did the fight judges give to MOTIV?)

1044
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,279
The highest points the fight judge...

1045
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,980
gave to MOTIV was...

1046
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,989
95 points.

1047
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:39,660
They might give more points to Logistx.

1048
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:42,360
I'll reveal the score the fight judges gave...

1049
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:43,930
to MOTIV.

1050
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:47,459
In the World of K-pop Mission, MOTIV's performance...

1051
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,129
was such a shame.

1052
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:52,999
I know that we did better than OSAKA Ojo Gang.

1053
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,200
I wonder what they get.

1054
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,339
I think it'll be between 250 and 270.

1055
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,410
They're like a founder.

1056
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,710
(The fight judges' total score is 281 points.)

1057
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,010
Okay.

1058
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:08,979
(Shocked)

1059
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,320
This is crazy.

1060
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,259
- They gave a high score. - They're generous with scores.

1061
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,720
It's so high.

1062
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:18,090
This is interesting.

1063
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:21,429
Now, we'll watch OSAKA Ojo Gang's video...

1064
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:24,430
for G-DRAGON's mission song.

1065
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,500
Let's see.

1066
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:27,640
I can't wait.

1067
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,709
OSAKA Ojo Gang. They're very interesting in another way.

1068
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,709
This is like individual superstars.

1069
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:34,979
- Yes. - They're like solo-based.

1070
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:38,450
They were brought here and made a team.

1071
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,579
So, this is the first time we're actually seeing...

1072
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,379
the crew showcase together...

1073
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,449
- For real. - I got it.

1074
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:47,089
- They also have a challenge. - Yes.

1075
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:48,120
Breakdancing.

1076
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:50,989
I would do the same thing, though,

1077
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:52,359
if I could do breakdancing.

1078
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,059
- No way. Yes. - Follow me.

1079
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,060
Good luck.

1080
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,329
This is Street Woman Fighter.

1081
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:59,539
It's like, literally, you want to beat the other person.

1082
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,699
- It's like this. - Exactly.

1083
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,770
And I think that was a great strategy by MOTIV.

1084
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:08,240
It's definitely advanced. I think it's impossible.

1085
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,980
Let's see if someone could cover the part in OSAKA Ojo Gang.

1086
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:16,089
I wonder how they did the breakdancing part.

1087
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,149
Who did it?

1088
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,849
The sister of Momo from TWICE.

1089
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:19,860
Hana did it.

1090
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,419
(During MOTIV's rehearsal)

1091
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,329
(OSAKA Ojo Gang is practicing.)

1092
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,059
(Hana is staring somewhere.)

1093
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,259
(Logistx's perfect breakdancing)

1094
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,899
I was really anxious.

1095
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,630
(After the Choreography Exchange)

1096
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:33,676
(Hana is studying Logistx's perfect breakdancing.)

1097
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:36,170
Left leg.

1098
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:38,140
(Struggling)

1099
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:39,780
Wait. Is it even possible?

1100
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,839
When I tried it myself,

1101
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,210
it was so hard.

1102
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,080
I thought I was in trouble.

1103
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,950
(Glaring)

1104
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:50,449
MOTIV's copy section is beyond difficult.

1105
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:52,719
I mean, it just shows how difficult breakdancing is.

1106
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,820
We'll be in big trouble if we lose.

1107
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:57,089
I just have to practice.

1108
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,599
I just want to give it all...

1109
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,000
and do my best.

1110
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,200
(The day of the final rehearsal)

1111
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:06,369
(She did the breakdancing part.)

1112
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:07,770
What a relief.

1113
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,140
(Section of tumbling twice)

1114
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:13,080
(But, tumbling only once?)

1115
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:14,310
I'm not surprised.

1116
00:46:14,311 --> 00:46:16,109
It's definitely advanced.

1117
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:18,480
It didn't go as it should have.

1118
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,149
When I was practicing,

1119
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,420
I was able to do a roundoff several times.

1120
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,520
But when I tried to do back tumbling right after a roundoff,

1121
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:29,159
I failed.

1122
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,089
(She keeps failing it.)

1123
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:34,230
I really felt under pressure.

1124
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,059
(She has never been able to do tumbling twice.)

1125
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,329
I was a bit scared.

1126
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:40,469
Do I make our performance bad?

1127
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:42,269
Relax. You can relax.

1128
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:45,109
I'm nervous about whether I can do it or not.

1129
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,209
Don't think like, "What if I fail it?"

1130
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:48,839
I'll just do my best.

1131
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,479
(They'll show the choreography copy section soon.)

1132
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,160
I don't know how they're going to copy it.

1133
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:55,079
(They're about to do the choreography copy section.)

1134
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,549
Being anxious won't help. I just have to do it.

1135
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:58,550
(First try)

1136
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:00,389
I hit my knees on the floor.

1137
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:01,519
(Startled)

1138
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,889
(Second try)

1139
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:05,390
(Failed)

1140
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:09,159
If I fell out of the trick,

1141
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,469
next time we do a run-through, I wouldn't do that trick.

1142
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:13,769
- I'm sorry. - It's all right.

1143
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:15,250
(The crew members are cheering Hana.)

1144
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:17,470
I failed the first try.

1145
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,939
I also failed the second try.

1146
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:24,349
But all the members told me I did a good job.

1147
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:26,850
I'll do my best for my team.

1148
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,120
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's last take)

1149
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,790
(How will OSAKA Ojo Gang's performance be?)

1150
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:37,690
They look awesome.

1151
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:46,439
It's Kyoka!

1152
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,721
It's a great decision that they changed the opening part.

1153
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,840
Kyoka got so much swag.

1154
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:57,410
It's just crazy.

1155
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:01,549
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's choreography section)

1156
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:02,550
Yes, Queen!

1157
00:48:02,551 --> 00:48:03,890
- Ibuki is a machine. - Yes.

1158
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:05,950
Nice.

1159
00:48:05,951 --> 00:48:07,990
They have more energy, like fire.

1160
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:09,729
They're more fiery.

1161
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:11,189
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's choreography section)

1162
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:12,929
I can't believe it's the same as MOTIV's.

1163
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:16,059
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's choreography section)

1164
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,869
Go!

1165
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:19,940
- Tighter. - Go!

1166
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:22,440
Just in their pocket.

1167
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:26,779
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's choreography section)

1168
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,010
Here you go.

1169
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,320
I wasn't excited like that when I watched MOTIV's video.

1170
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:34,780
Go, Minami!

1171
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:38,049
- They look awesome. - So cool.

1172
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:39,890
They're really good.

1173
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:43,430
Minami is also flashy.

1174
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:49,360
That was a good one.

1175
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:04,779
I love these two.

1176
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:05,980
They're an iconic duo.

1177
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,290
You really get the freestyle vibe from Minami and Kyoka.

1178
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:12,350
They look cool.

1179
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:16,060
Let's go, Hana.

1180
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:18,689
(How did she do the breakdancing section?)

1181
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:19,859
(MOTIV's choreography section)

1182
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:22,600
- Go, Hana! - Let's go!

1183
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:24,869
Okay!

1184
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:27,069
It must've been really hard. I feel so bad.

1185
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:29,870
(MOTIV's choreography section)

1186
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:35,109
Nice.

1187
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:37,510
(MOTIV's choreography section)

1188
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:38,849
Come on, Queen!

1189
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,480
- Take a look at her. - Let's go!

1190
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:42,850
(MOTIV's choreography section)

1191
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:45,549
(She did a backflip!)

1192
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:46,789
(Shy)

1193
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:47,859
I had a low expectation.

1194
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:48,960
Only if we all knew.

1195
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,860
(MOTIV's choreography section)

1196
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,430
She got it.

1197
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,870
Go crazy. Go.

1198
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:02,240
I love that one.

1199
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:06,010
- Energy up. - Yes.

1200
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,410
- What a girl. - They changed it.

1201
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,150
The killing part is coming.

1202
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,120
Period!

1203
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:25,070
They look like they're having so much fun.

1204
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:32,930
Yes, Ojo Gang!

1205
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,540
Good job.

1206
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:36,839
It's coming.

1207
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,310
Ending fairy.

1208
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:39,940
Ending fairy. Let's go!

1209
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:41,080
(The fairy is here.)

1210
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,710
(Kyoka!)

1211
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,350
(Shy fairy)

1212
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,871
(The first exciting experience of being a K-ending fairy)

1213
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,389
She's cute.

1214
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:57,430
She's cool. She's cute.

1215
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,760
(Crew of cool and cute princesses)

1216
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,330
I'm glad no one has a weird face.

1217
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,030
Nice. Okay.

1218
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:07,700
(Successful ending)

1219
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:11,709
That's pretty impressive. More. They just had...

1220
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:13,639
(OSAKA Ojo Gang is more...)

1221
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,409
- More dynamic. - Yes.

1222
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:18,409
It definitely comes with more aggressive energy.

1223
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:20,379
- Yes. - And watching it,

1224
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:23,820
I couldn't tell that they hadn't danced together long.

1225
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:27,290
It looks like they had some chemistry in this performance to me.

1226
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,159
This is the World of K-pop Mission.

1227
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:35,199
It's important that each one showcases K-pop style moves.

1228
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,499
OSAKA Ojo Gang did a better job...

1229
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,669
of highlighting each one.

1230
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:41,176
(Choreography that highlights K-pop style)

1231
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,939
Did Hana do breakdancing, too? She did the tumbling.

1232
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:45,940
Yes.

1233
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,380
I believe she did her best.

1234
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,949
Back tumbling isn't easy...

1235
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:53,850
for a dancer, to be honest.

1236
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:57,389
Hana worked really hard for her crew.

1237
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:59,250
I really respect her.

1238
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,289
Like, take one for the crew.

1239
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:02,760
Take one for the team.

1240
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:06,499
Will OSAKA Ojo Gang get...

1241
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,660
a higher score than MOTIV?

1242
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:11,869
It'll be higher. It has to be.

1243
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:13,569
- It'll definitely be higher. - It must be.

1244
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:14,599
(They're expected to score higher for incorporating K-pop style well.)

1245
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,299
If I individually judge,

1246
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,610
I'll probably give them 85 points.

1247
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,879
If they get a higher score,

1248
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,410
- I'll be mad. - Yes.

1249
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:25,180
As a result of the Fight Judges Evaluation,

1250
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:29,150
the highest points the fight judge gave was...

1251
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:33,190
94 points.

1252
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:36,729
What did we get, 95 points?

1253
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:38,530
We got 95 points. Just 1 point higher.

1254
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:40,300
What does it mean?

1255
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,829
Could we lose with this score?

1256
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:46,129
I was like, "What?"

1257
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:48,740
I was thinking about how it happened.

1258
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:51,569
OSAKA Ojo Gang showed...

1259
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:53,439
certain movements...

1260
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,439
that Koreans love,

1261
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,680
but I'm a bit disappointed with the last song.

1262
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:01,749
The choreography routine...

1263
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:04,119
and energy got weaker.

1264
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,120
That was a bit disappointing.

1265
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:07,619
(OSAKA Ojo Gang scored 94 points, lower than MOTIV's 95 points.)

1266
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:08,819
What is this?

1267
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,090
(Unexpected)

1268
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:12,459
Even though it didn't mean we lost,

1269
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:15,130
I felt anxious.

1270
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,829
I'll reveal the score the fight judge gave...

1271
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:21,540
to OSAKA Ojo Gang.

1272
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:24,831
(What is the fight judges' score for OSAKA Ojo Gang in the GD match?)

1273
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:29,710
It can't be true.

1274
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:32,130
(The fight judges' score is the same.)

1275
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:34,819
(Laughing)

1276
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:35,820
(Unexpected same score)

1277
00:53:35,821 --> 00:53:37,090
(Shaking her head)

1278
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,019
(Really?)

1279
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:42,120
How could this happen?

1280
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:44,630
The score for OSAKA Ojo Gang...

1281
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:48,099
is 281 points out of 300.

1282
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,570
This is the same score as MOTIV.

1283
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,970
The same score?

1284
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,270
- It's amazing. - It is.

1285
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,869
For the choreography,

1286
00:53:56,870 --> 00:54:00,739
it's clear that OSAKA Ojo Gang understands K-pop.

1287
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:03,139
So I thought we'd win.

1288
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:06,719
(Unbelievable result of the same score)

1289
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,679
They are both a really strong team.

1290
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,749
But each is missing something.

1291
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:12,020
Yes.

1292
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:15,059
When they came to the choreography part,

1293
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,959
it didn't look clean, right?

1294
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,099
Also, they just weren't as tight as OSAKA Ojo Gang.

1295
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:23,730
But, actually, for the breakdancing,

1296
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:25,829
it's not comparable.

1297
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:28,399
It's not something you can do in a day.

1298
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,540
I don't feel like they're necessary for it to be a K-pop challenge.

1299
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,639
(Both crews got the same score.)

1300
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,710
All their scores are the same so far.

1301
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:38,709
(From the Class Mission till now, their scores are the same)

1302
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:41,450
The number of likes would decide the result.

1303
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,019
In the Global Public Evaluation,

1304
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:49,660
MOTIV has 1,193,401 views.

1305
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,830
OSAKA Ojo Gang...

1306
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:57,570
- has 1,386,938 views. - They have more views.

1307
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,640
OSAKA Ojo Gang has more views.

1308
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:03,810
Do they have about 200,000 more views?

1309
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,530
When we have 200,000 more views, is it possible for us to lose?

1310
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:09,080
The views are like that.

1311
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,880
The fate of the two crews is...

1312
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:13,980
in the number of likes.

1313
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,490
The final score, including Global Public Evaluation.

1314
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:19,850
What do you think it would be?

1315
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:22,289
Because of our engagement in the comments,

1316
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:26,359
it's really not clear whether we won or lost.

1317
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:30,929
But regardless, if it comes down to it, we're ready to battle.

1318
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:33,939
We're ready to continue to show ourselves in this competition.

1319
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:36,770
So, yes. We'll see what happens.

1320
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:38,670
Yes.

1321
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,909
Because each of our characters...

1322
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:45,749
was shown well to the viewers,

1323
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:47,879
we received good comments.

1324
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:52,819
Since we have 200,000 more views,

1325
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,360
we look forward to the result.

1326
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,830
It's because of Hana's sister, Momo from TWICE.

1327
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:03,159
I didn't know we entered the popularity contest.

1328
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,670
- We did. - Yes.

1329
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:08,339
Now, we will see the score...

1330
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:11,640
of the Global Public Evaluation for MOTIV.

1331
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:16,950
(The final score of MOTIV in the GD match?)

1332
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,290
(MOTIV's final score is 881 points.)

1333
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:28,059
The views are 1,193,401.

1334
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:31,659
The likes are 97,420.

1335
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,630
So, they earned 600 points.

1336
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,430
The likes aren't many.

1337
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,669
- MOTIV lost. - MOTIV lost.

1338
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:38,829
(They're expected to lose because of fewer likes.)

1339
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:40,139
I'm not surprised.

1340
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:42,399
But I do think what's upsetting is...

1341
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,809
I think, we're one of the cleanest teams...

1342
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:47,240
in general in this mission.

1343
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:52,250
It's daunting, given the fact that we're the least popular.

1344
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,549
I don't want to go home.

1345
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:57,290
We're going to do everything we can to stay here.

1346
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:00,119
- We're going to battle. - MOTIV.

1347
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,790
(Let's get ready to battle!)

1348
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,760
MOTIV, don't be eliminated.

1349
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,329
I really don't want them to be eliminated.

1350
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:07,359
I don't really think...

1351
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,800
we need two Japanese crews.

1352
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:12,769
Now, we will see the score...

1353
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:16,140
of the Global Public Evaluation for OSAKA Ojo Gang.

1354
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:18,410
Come on.

1355
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:20,179
(Looking forward to it)

1356
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:23,610
I believe we really made a strong impression.

1357
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:28,780
I'm sure we will definitely win in likes.

1358
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:31,566
(As they expected, will OSAKA Ojo Gang have more likes?)

1359
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:34,890
(Who will be the winner in the GD match?)

1360
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:41,459
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's final score is 781 points.)

1361
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:42,999
(Frozen)

1362
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,930
(Shocked)

1363
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,600
Wait. It's ridiculous.

1364
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:51,510
Oh, my gosh. No way.

1365
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:53,709
(All the crews are shocked by OSAKA Ojo Gang's loss.)

1366
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:54,710
I can't believe it.

1367
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,020
That's crazy.

1368
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:03,749
(Everyone, including the winner, is surprised by the result.)

1369
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,490
(Disappointed)

1370
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,060
We don't have to battle.

1371
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:11,760
(Just enjoy the moment.)

1372
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:16,160
Thank you! Thank you so much.

1373
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:20,200
Thank you! Thank you so much.

1374
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,509
(Enjoying the moment of the victory)

1375
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:26,979
OSAKA Ojo Gang...

1376
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:31,579
has 1,386,938 views...

1377
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:34,879
and 80,092 likes.

1378
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,890
So, they earned 500 points in the Global Public Evaluation.

1379
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,959
In the GD match...

1380
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:45,089
between MOTIV and OSAKA Ojo Gang,

1381
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:48,259
MOTIV was spared...

1382
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:50,270
on the verge of elimination.

1383
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:54,870
It's so relieving knowing that we're moving on in this competition.

1384
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:57,139
They were looking forward to winning, and...

1385
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:59,110
we were looking forward to battling.

1386
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:01,340
But the table has turned.

1387
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,079
(The number of likes determined the crews' victory and defeat.)

1388
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:07,120
As OSAKA Ojo Gang loses,

1389
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:09,080
they are at risk of elimination.

1390
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:11,350
I feel like OSAKA Ojo Gang might be at the lowest rank.

1391
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:12,889
They're going to have to battle.

1392
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:14,989
(Osaka Ojo Gang is likely to battle after receiving the lowest score.)

1393
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:16,659
We accept that we lost.

1394
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:19,229
We'll get ready to battle.

1395
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:21,360
(Ready for it anytime!)

1396
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,829
We'll get over the defeat.

1397
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:28,400
We'll prove that we deserve to stay here.

1398
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:30,940
Let's go!

1399
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:37,209
- Cheer up. - Yes.

1400
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:38,250
Let's cheer up.

1401
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:40,780
When I came to World of Street Woman Fighter,

1402
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,950
I came here only to win.

1403
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:44,490
So, I can't lose now.

1404
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:47,359
I really hope...

1405
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,360
OSAKA Ojo Gang loses.

1406
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,390
It'll be more fun without them.

1407
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:53,460
(What will happen to them facing the greatest crisis?)

1408
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:55,206
(World of K-pop Mission, the first crew to be eliminated)

1409
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:57,399
(RHTokyo, the choreography genius)

1410
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,629
(BUMSUP)

1411
00:59:58,630 --> 00:59:59,630
(Star!)

1412
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:00,739
(We have many K-pop choreographers.)

1413
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:02,569
(It's a K-pop mission. Being eliminated...)

1414
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:03,570
(doesn't make sense.)

1415
01:00:03,571 --> 01:00:06,309
(We have the queen of K-pop, Rie Hata.)

1416
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:07,709
(We have the upper hand.)

1417
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:10,449
(AG SQUAD just owns the moment.)

1418
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:13,279
(The new generation, ROYAL FAMILY. This is the brand.)

1419
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,949
(They don't look very worried.)

1420
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:16,020
(Relaxed)

1421
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,866
(The first Elimination Battle to determine the crews' fate)

1422
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:19,449
(Unexpected crews to be eliminated)

1423
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:20,459
(Shocked)

1424
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,460
(Wait. What?)

1425
01:00:21,461 --> 01:00:22,689
(That doesn't make any sense.)

1426
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:24,589
(Just battle. Not a big deal.)

1427
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:25,829
(I was anxious.)

1428
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:32,230
(World of Street Woman Fighter. Who's the first crew eliminated?)

1429
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:33,900
World of Street Woman Fighter.

1430
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:37,040
World of K-pop Mission with the risk of the first elimination.

1431
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:40,710
The Jennie match between Team Japan RHTokyo...

1432
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:43,540
and Team Korea BUMSUP. I'll announce the result.

1433
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:46,009
I feel like these two groups...

1434
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:49,479
understand this challenge the most.

1435
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,949
They're K-pop masters.

1436
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:53,190
That's why they're against each other.

1437
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,920
It's us. I'm so nervous.

1438
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,360
(I'm so nervous!)

1439
01:00:57,361 --> 01:01:00,289
- Oh, my gosh. I don't know. - Please.

1440
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:01,300
I'm so nervous.

1441
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:05,130
First, we'll see the score of the Class Mission.

1442
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:07,199
(The result of the Class Mission)

1443
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,770
They start with minus 50 points.

1444
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:11,310
We have 150 fewer points.

1445
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:14,540
(RHTokyo chose BUMSUP as the worst dancer.)

1446
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,050
(BUMSUP got penalty points.)

1447
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,886
(They're against each other again by Rie Hata's pick)

1448
01:01:18,910 --> 01:01:21,350
(Once Rie Hata targets it, she never lets it go.)

1449
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:25,150
(Team Korea must be strong for this mission.)

1450
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:26,650
(Fairly!)

1451
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:28,760
(I chose them.)

1452
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:31,260
She put it in a really nice way.

1453
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,430
We have the lowest points now.

1454
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:36,860
RHTokyo is pretty determined.

1455
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:38,700
This mission is for us.

1456
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:41,200
I really want to surprise them.

1457
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:44,540
I think it'll be tough.

1458
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:49,939
BUMSUP has many great choreographers.

1459
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:53,549
They're loved and supported by many people.

1460
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:54,580
I will never lose.

1461
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:55,980
Seven.

1462
01:01:56,350 --> 01:01:58,449
One, two, three, four,

1463
01:01:58,450 --> 01:02:00,089
five, and six.

1464
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:01,090
(Yes!)

1465
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:05,990
They have already copied ours.

1466
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:08,130
They're moving on quickly. It's annoying.

1467
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,130
Because they're one team, the teamwork is great.

1468
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:14,939
(Glancing)

1469
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,799
I tried so hard not to look at them.

1470
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:17,839
I was curious, though.

1471
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:20,110
So, I keep glancing at them.

1472
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:22,810
Okay. They're turning. They're moving their hips.

1473
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,209
(It's funny that I watched everything.)

1474
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:27,380
Leejung always wears sunglasses.

1475
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,719
With her sunglasses on, she looks at them like this.

1476
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,290
(Watching them)

1477
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:34,690
You're covering your eyes.

1478
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:36,460
(Perfect disguise)

1479
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:40,430
During this competition, I love sunglasses more.

1480
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:42,460
Let's practice the choreography copy section.

1481
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:45,530
(Watching)

1482
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:49,200
Hitting your hand and head like this.

1483
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:53,270
Rie Hata's choreography is really difficult.

1484
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:57,280
I don't think they can do it in a day.

1485
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:59,310
It's easier than you think.

1486
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:01,680
Aiki sorted it out so well.

1487
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:05,890
(Aiki and Leejung came early and practiced it.)

1488
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:09,960
She probably thought it would be difficult for us.

1489
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:11,460
But I was confident.

1490
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,829
After we practice it, we'll teach the rest.

1491
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:14,830
Sure.

1492
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:17,170
We have to show them.

1493
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:21,000
K-pop mission.

1494
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,070
And raise your arms.

1495
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:26,270
We finished!

1496
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:27,810
We ate it all.

1497
01:03:27,910 --> 01:03:29,240
(Tokyo ate it!)

1498
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:31,080
(Thinking)

1499
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:34,180
(We're off now.)

1500
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:36,720
Why are they leaving already?

1501
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:38,120
Did they finish it already?

1502
01:03:38,350 --> 01:03:39,820
It bothers me a little.

1503
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,596
(Choreography rehearsal for World of K-pop Mission)

1504
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:44,490
I'm excited to watch this.

1505
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,530
(RHTokyo's rehearsal starts.)

1506
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:50,699
I added all kinds of movements...

1507
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:53,730
that make people think we'll win.

1508
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:54,840
(Excited)

1509
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,970
Creative and so cool.

1510
01:03:58,370 --> 01:03:59,740
Just Rie Hata's dance.

1511
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:01,610
It's predictable and usual.

1512
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:03,540
- Ours is really different. - So different.

1513
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:08,150
(To the choreography copy section)

1514
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:10,250
(BUMSUP's choreography section)

1515
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:11,720
It seems to be sudden.

1516
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:14,960
They're not perfectly synced.

1517
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:17,290
(Wabbling)

1518
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:18,730
They're not clean in this part.

1519
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,799
They've totally gone more about the swag.

1520
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:27,239
That's why she's so creative.

1521
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,599
She's just so much like Parris Goebel.

1522
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,886
Theirs is really different from ours.

1523
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:33,470
It could depend on personal preference.

1524
01:04:33,810 --> 01:04:35,810
It was just Rie Hata's RHTokyo.

1525
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:39,350
It doesn't surprise me because that's what she always does.

1526
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,050
I think we made the latter part better.

1527
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:43,320
We need to bring the mood.

1528
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:45,949
(BUMSUP's rehearsal starts.)

1529
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:47,420
This is a K-pop mission.

1530
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,090
We really need to show them this time.

1531
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:54,130
- I love their style. - I like BUMSUP.

1532
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:56,900
Korea is the best at K-pop.

1533
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,970
It looks like art.

1534
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,240
Their movements look familiar.

1535
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:07,540
It doesn't meet my expectations.

1536
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:13,080
(To the choreography copy section)

1537
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:15,380
(RHTokyo's choreography section)

1538
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,220
It's good.

1539
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:20,390
Let's go, Aiki.

1540
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:22,889
(Missed the beats)

1541
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:23,890
She missed it.

1542
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,560
They got all stumped.

1543
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:26,960
It's hard, isn't it?

1544
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:30,530
It's good. We'll win.

1545
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,000
I messed up with RHTokyo's choreography section.

1546
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:36,969
When I saw it, I thought I could definitely do it.

1547
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:38,240
It's just movements.

1548
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:41,240
I thought I could do it.

1549
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:45,080
One, two, three, four, and...

1550
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:47,480
Oh, no.

1551
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:50,479
(She can't get used to dancing in Rie Hata's style.)

1552
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,990
I've never done something like this.

1553
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:55,190
It was difficult when I tried it.

1554
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:57,859
It's really difficult.

1555
01:05:57,860 --> 01:06:00,700
When you miss a beat while dancing, you can't get it right.

1556
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:03,659
I was frustrated knowing I couldn't do it in a short time.

1557
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:05,370
It's so obvious.

1558
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:09,199
We can see their skills in choreography and teamwork.

1559
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,470
They can't be compared to us.

1560
01:06:11,810 --> 01:06:13,209
(BUMSUP received feedback from other crews.)

1561
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:14,210
It's here.

1562
01:06:14,310 --> 01:06:16,639
Oh, my gosh.

1563
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,410
Everyone voted for RHTokyo.

1564
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:20,150
It says we weren't clean enough.

1565
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:22,980
It also says it'd be better if the performance was stronger.

1566
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:26,690
Strong performance was Rie Hata's strength.

1567
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:29,989
Most feedback is about being clean.

1568
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:31,560
I actually agreed with the feedback.

1569
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:34,230
It's the fact that we're not perfectly synced.

1570
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:36,729
We'll clean it up as you wish, then.

1571
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:38,430
Once we do, you're all dead.

1572
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:41,370
- Rie Hata. - Yes.

1573
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:43,299
Today's theme is...

1574
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:47,409
to add Jennie's logo and RHTokyo's logo...

1575
01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:50,750
to our hair. I thought it'd be interesting.

1576
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:52,310
So, we attached hair extensions.

1577
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:53,709
It looks so natural.

1578
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:56,820
Do you have any concerns about your hair?

1579
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:59,719
My hair has been damaged from bleaching.

1580
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:00,890
It's bleach-damaged hair.

1581
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:04,060
I often get a perm,

1582
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,990
and it damages my hair.

1583
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:08,230
We all need to treat the damaged hair.

1584
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:12,730
Just like skin, hair also ages by heat and light.

1585
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:16,369
So, it's better to apply heat protectant serum...

1586
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:19,469
before using a hair dryer or a hair iron.

1587
01:07:19,470 --> 01:07:23,879
Apply it every day to protect from the heat, like using sunscreen.

1588
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,009
It smells good.

1589
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:26,250
(It smells like a hair salon.)

1590
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:30,150
When I dance, my bang is messed up.

1591
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:33,819
Could you fix my bang?

1592
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:37,190
Then, you can use a hair fixer in a water type.

1593
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:40,830
This hair fixer in a water type fixes every single hair.

1594
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:44,700
So, your hair will be shiny all day and maintain its volume.

1595
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,130
It's great.

1596
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:48,870
It's good. I like it.

1597
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,410
I like that it isn't tangled.

1598
01:07:54,310 --> 01:07:57,280
- Thanks. - Thanks.

1599
01:07:57,810 --> 01:08:01,180
We prepared something unique, being different from other crews.

1600
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:04,719
I believe we can show our teamwork and unity,

1601
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,920
which are our strengths in this mission.

1602
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,190
I think we're a very impressive team...

1603
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:14,199
that brings up the mood.

1604
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,659
I am confident we will show our strengths...

1605
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:17,930
and win it by a big margin.

1606
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:22,470
Now, we'll watch RHTokyo's video...

1607
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:25,770
for the Jennie match.

1608
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:32,009
Although they're a Japanese team, they're leading the way...

1609
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:34,326
in K-pop choreography and trends that the young generation loves.

1610
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:38,219
RHTokyo's Rie Hata and Reina are also killing it.

1611
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:40,989
I got a lot of members of RHTokyo who choreograph for K-pop.

1612
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:44,689
So, they are setting what K-pop is currently.

1613
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:47,460
They're making those decisions. Movements-wise.

1614
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:48,630
I'm so excited.

1615
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:49,960
Jennie Power.

1616
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,770
I want to show it to everyone.

1617
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,440
Compared to BUMSUP, we'll make a stronger impression,

1618
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:57,840
so I believe RHTokyo is awesome.

1619
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,240
Yes, let's watch it.

1620
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:01,610
Come on, friends.

1621
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,040
(RHTokyo's video)

1622
01:09:04,150 --> 01:09:05,349
(It's starting.)

1623
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:06,910
- Tokyo! - Tokyo!

1624
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:09,019
(Looking forward to it)

1625
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:10,050
Let's go.

1626
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:16,020
- Jennie in the hair. Come on. - Jennie!

1627
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:17,480
They printed Jennie on their hair.

1628
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:18,690
Come on, hair.

1629
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:24,159
(Listen on Spotify)

1630
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,376
("Mantra," "Like Jennie," "ExtraL" by Jennie)

1631
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:26,400
So many details.

1632
01:09:26,401 --> 01:09:28,670
I just realized that they made custom Jennie outfits.

1633
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:30,370
Jennie jumpsuits.

1634
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:34,740
Giving flavors.

1635
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:37,910
Come on.

1636
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:39,350
- Come on. - Come on.

1637
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:41,680
I love that part.

1638
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:43,020
Ako!

1639
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:44,020
(Ako, yes.)

1640
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:52,090
Yes.

1641
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:53,090
(Sexy)

1642
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:54,760
(Embarrassed)

1643
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,640
The one in the back with a ponytail!

1644
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:04,000
RHTokyo is so good at making a great picture.

1645
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:07,469
- How cute. - I think...

1646
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:09,639
they fed off each other a lot with their energy.

1647
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:10,740
- Right. - Really.

1648
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:15,879
Go, Reina!

1649
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:16,880
There you go!

1650
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:18,950
There you go!

1651
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:21,390
(That's it!)

1652
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:22,920
They look so good.

1653
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,029
Go, Nina.

1654
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:30,030
(BUMSUP's choreography section)

1655
01:10:30,031 --> 01:10:32,599
This is originally BUMSUP's choreography.

1656
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:35,470
We practiced diligently to do the choreography perfectly.

1657
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:39,309
- Go, Nina. - Yes.

1658
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:42,139
(BUMSUP's choreography section)

1659
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:43,739
That one looks so clean.

1660
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:50,149
(BUMSUP's choreography section)

1661
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:51,349
The choreography part...

1662
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:53,019
- I kind of couldn't tell... - Yes.

1663
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:54,090
Whose it was.

1664
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,059
- It's true. - They were both equally...

1665
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:57,860
- They look so good. - Yes.

1666
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:00,159
- So clean. - Hey.

1667
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,330
Go, Mona.

1668
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:05,600
Please.

1669
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:06,800
Here it comes.

1670
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,410
Yes, Rico!

1671
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:14,680
(She continues to slay.)

1672
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:16,810
This is a really good part.

1673
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:19,080
It's a competition.

1674
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:22,620
(Startled)

1675
01:11:22,621 --> 01:11:24,181
(Her facial expression was incredible.)

1676
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:32,690
Period.

1677
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:43,999
I have goosebumps.

1678
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,009
I still have goosebumps. Seriously.

1679
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:47,010
That's a blowout.

1680
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:48,480
- Yes, they're killing it. - Yes.

1681
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:55,680
Go crazy.

1682
01:11:55,681 --> 01:11:57,050
Look at those abs, girl.

1683
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:00,520
It's so K-poppy to me.

1684
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:02,259
There are a lot of different things...

1685
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:03,319
- happening at the same time. - Yes.

1686
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,530
We aren't watching one thing.

1687
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:05,959
Hit it with that...

1688
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:08,259
(RHTokyo's choreography section)

1689
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:09,329
They ate it.

1690
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:11,100
(Impressed)

1691
01:12:11,230 --> 01:12:15,770
Seriously, RHTokyo is so good at choreographing.

1692
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:17,569
- Hit it with that - Jennie

1693
01:12:17,570 --> 01:12:19,369
Rie's switching is incredible.

1694
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:21,009
It's so cool.

1695
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:24,009
(RHTokyo's choreography section)

1696
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:25,510
(Rico is insane.)

1697
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:27,380
Rico is a gangster.

(RHTokyo's choreography section)

1699
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,120
Go crazy.

(RHTokyo's choreography section)

1701
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:36,990
(RHTokyo's choreography section)

1702
01:12:38,290 --> 01:12:39,459
- Yes. - They ripped it up.

1703
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:41,259
- Yes! - Good!

1704
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:44,229
People will like our choreography better than Team Korea's,

1705
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:45,630
so I'm confident.

1706
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:48,240
I love this part.

1707
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,069
- Nice! - It's so exciting.

1708
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:53,310
I'm having so much fun.

1709
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:56,779
Their performance...

1710
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:59,080
has a lot of street elements.

1711
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,429
(She becomes obsessed right away.)

1712
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:12,430
(Me too.)

1713
01:13:12,431 --> 01:13:13,551
(Everyone becomes obsessed.)

1714
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,660
We have to learn the challenge.

1715
01:13:21,070 --> 01:13:23,699
Do my, do my ladies run this, ladies run this?

1716
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:26,540
(They're ready to do the challenge.)

1717
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:34,009
(Applauding)

1718
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:35,749
Fire!

1719
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:38,120
- Thank you. - Rie!

1720
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:40,190
(What's going on?)

1721
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:42,140
(It's time for the ending fairy.)

1722
01:13:42,290 --> 01:13:44,060
(Stern, majestic, and serious)

1723
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:46,629
(Cute and sexy)

1724
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:47,860
She's so cute.

1725
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,460
(Gangster)

1726
01:13:50,830 --> 01:13:52,400
Senorita!

1727
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:55,670
(The perfect angle)

1728
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,400
(100 percent awkwardness)

1729
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,940
(Cute)

1730
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:01,879
I wanted that face.

1731
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,809
(Biting her lips)

1732
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:05,009
(She bit her lips!)

1733
01:14:05,010 --> 01:14:06,910
She bit her lips, girl.

1734
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:08,980
(The atmosphere gets heated up.)

1735
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:11,790
The part in which she bit her lips was a bit hard.

1736
01:14:15,490 --> 01:14:17,419
RHTokyo, I think,

1737
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:19,289
are choreography geniuses.

1738
01:14:19,290 --> 01:14:20,789
- Right. - Really.

1739
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,999
They were masterful about those outfit changes.

1740
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,070
When one comes up... Usually, you're like,

1741
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,069
- "They're all coming up." - Yes.

1742
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:29,239
But they made every single one...

1743
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:31,370
- still feel good, right? - Yes.

1744
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:35,280
Yes. Even to the very end, when Rie, the last one...

1745
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:36,979
You know that her clothes...

1746
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:38,250
- are going to come off. - Yes.

1747
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:40,779
But they timed it out with the drop.

1748
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:42,520
They let it breathe, still.

1749
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:45,089
They nailed memorable moments.

1750
01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:46,290
They killed it.

1751
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:49,089
I feel like it started to drop a little bit...

1752
01:14:49,090 --> 01:14:50,090
- towards the end. - Yes.

1753
01:14:50,190 --> 01:14:51,489
- Did you feel that? - Yes.

1754
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:54,729
During the last song, they spread out for the formation.

1755
01:14:54,730 --> 01:14:56,359
Why was it off?

1756
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:57,799
- This could be cleaner. - Right.

1757
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,270
- They were all just different. - Right.

1758
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:02,799
In K-pop performances,

1759
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:07,069
there's pleasure in seeing the synchronized moves.

1760
01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:08,540
It was a bit disappointing.

1761
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:12,749
The highest points the fight judge gave...

1762
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:14,510
to RHTokyo...

1763
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:17,050
is 96 points.

1764
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:19,190
Getting 96 points is incredible.

1765
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,459
The judges gave the highest score.

1766
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:23,790
It's very high.

1767
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,259
I'll reveal the score the fight judges gave...

1768
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:29,260
to RHTokyo.

1769
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,429
Our choreography was impactful,

1770
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:34,999
so I think the judges will give a higher score to us.

1771
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,439
No matter how I look at it, our choreography is better.

1772
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,910
It's a K-pop mission.

1773
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:41,580
It's high.

1774
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:44,139
(My goodness)

1775
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:45,609
Did we only lose 15 points?

1776
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:47,180
That's incredible!

1777
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:50,420
And RHTokyo already has 150 more points.

1778
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:52,050
It's so high.

1779
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:54,590
It'll be hard to get a higher score than that.

1780
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:59,730
To be honest, a difference of 150 points is big.

1781
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:03,159
"Unless we have a landslide victory,"

1782
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:06,099
"we'll lose." I had that thought.

1783
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:09,099
We'll now check out the video of the other crew...

1784
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:12,010
that competed with Jennie's songs, BUMSUP.

1785
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:13,739
BUMSUP, Team Korea,

1786
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:17,339
who are also... All of them are working with different artists.

1787
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:20,079
And their resumes are stacked. Over the years,

1788
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:23,519
they've worked with and trained all the different artists.

1789
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:25,519
Also, they're the leaders of various crews...

1790
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,549
that participated in the competition.

1791
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:29,759
Thus, their styles are different.

1792
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,029
I was worried because I thought...

1793
01:16:32,030 --> 01:16:34,799
that it'd be hard to bring those styles together.

1794
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,359
I'm so nervous. Hurry up and show us.

1795
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,299
We're LeAvengers.

1796
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:40,669
The Leader-Avengers.

1797
01:16:40,670 --> 01:16:44,399
You'll see so much improvement...

1798
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,440
in our teamwork.

1799
01:16:46,670 --> 01:16:48,510
I'm interested in seeing what that looks like.

1800
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:49,540
Let's see Team Korea's.

1801
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:51,080
Let's go.

1802
01:16:53,610 --> 01:16:55,320
(World of K-pop Mission filming day)

1803
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:57,720
(BUMSUP is absorbed in the stage rehearsal.)

1804
01:16:58,090 --> 01:17:00,450
(RHTokyo watches them.)

1805
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:07,060
(They suddenly stop the dance.)

1806
01:17:07,230 --> 01:17:09,359
- What's going on? - It's the hairpin.

1807
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,360
Did it come off?

1808
01:17:11,730 --> 01:17:13,970
(The hairpin came off while she was dancing.)

1809
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:17,940
(BUMSUP becomes flustered by the unexpected situation.)

1810
01:17:18,070 --> 01:17:20,150
(The rehearsal gets stopped because of the hairpin.)

1811
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:21,340
I'm sorry.

1812
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,579
(After fixing the hairpin, they resume the shoot.)

1813
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:26,350
(The hairpin comes off again.)

1814
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:28,250
(Gosh, it fell off again!)

1815
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:30,479
(They continue on with the second shoot.)

1816
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:33,090
(Failure)

1817
01:17:33,450 --> 01:17:34,960
(It must've fallen off again.)

1818
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:37,990
(Filming keeps getting stopped.)

1819
01:17:38,930 --> 01:17:40,130
I'm sorry.

1820
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:42,399
When I dropped the hairpin for the second time...

1821
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,300
To be completely honest, I wanted to die.

1822
01:17:47,470 --> 01:17:48,969
Everyone was exhausted,

1823
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:51,270
but a prop was acting out.

1824
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:53,070
I felt like...

1825
01:17:53,310 --> 01:17:55,340
everything would explode at the slightest touch.

1826
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,710
Are you too nervous? What's wrong?

1827
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:05,320
(Gabee tears up at a corner of the stage.)

1828
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:08,389
I don't know...

1829
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:11,490
why I burst into tears then.

1830
01:18:12,030 --> 01:18:13,159
(Sighing)

1831
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,229
I really understand.

1832
01:18:14,230 --> 01:18:16,376
It isn't anything strange. It isn't anything to feel bad about.

1833
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,499
We feel the same.

1834
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,629
We keep getting bad results.

1835
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:22,599
We really don't want to let people down.

1836
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:26,239
So the pressure and tension stemming from that thought...

1837
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:29,840
and everything else are giving us a hard time.

1838
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:31,379
To be honest,

1839
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:33,949
I don't care about making a mistake and taking criticisms.

1840
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:35,279
- But we take the fall together. - Together.

1841
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:36,280
- Together. - Together.

1842
01:18:36,281 --> 01:18:38,119
People say that we aren't in sync.

1843
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,120
- It's stressful. - Yes.

1844
01:18:39,121 --> 01:18:41,089
- You feel like you hurt the team. - Yes.

1845
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:43,720
It's so much pressure.

1846
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:47,759
I know that we can't do better in the limited amount of time.

1847
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,429
"We can do better."

1848
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:52,669
I had that thought...

1849
01:18:52,670 --> 01:18:54,299
although it was our best.

1850
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:55,569
You know,

1851
01:18:55,570 --> 01:18:58,170
I think we should accept our differences.

1852
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,539
I want us to believe that we'll get better.

1853
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:04,950
We can't do anything about the fact that we're different.

1854
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:09,149
We're done our own styles of dancing for too many years.

1855
01:19:09,150 --> 01:19:11,149
Our colors are too rich.

1856
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:13,949
So I think bringing them as one...

1857
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:16,459
is harder than painting...

1858
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:17,919
on a white piece of paper.

1859
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,630
I think it's a process.

1860
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:22,259
We need to have 1 mind and 1 goal.

1861
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:23,799
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1862
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,769
After this part...

1863
01:19:25,770 --> 01:19:28,069
- I'll make it tasteful. - Don't do this.

1864
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:29,139
That part is yours.

1865
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:31,939
So that we don't become an elimination candidate,

1866
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:34,709
we'll protect our position with our pride on the line.

1867
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:36,179
Let's go. Let's really do this.

1868
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:37,439
- With the tiger's spirit, - With the tiger's spirit,

1869
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,250
- BUMSUP - I think we did our absolute best.

1870
01:19:41,450 --> 01:19:42,620
Let's see Team Korea's.

1871
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,350
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1872
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:48,719
(BUMSUP, let's go.)

1873
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:50,620
(Nervous)

1874
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,090
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1875
01:19:53,490 --> 01:19:55,899
(Listen on Spotify)

1876
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:58,630
("Mantra," "like Jennie," "ExtraL" by Jennie)

1877
01:20:00,030 --> 01:20:01,099
It's a picture already.

1878
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:02,600
I like the way they started too.

1879
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:07,970
Go, Gabee!

1880
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:10,910
Oh, my.

1881
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:17,550
There's no impact.

1882
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:29,259
Come on.

1883
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:30,300
Period!

1884
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:36,369
It's just really nice movement and staging.

1885
01:20:36,370 --> 01:20:38,870
It's so clean, and they're telling a story.

1886
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,439
(BUMSUP's choreography section)

1887
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:44,580
I love that part the most.

1888
01:20:45,650 --> 01:20:46,950
It's something only you can do.

1889
01:20:47,450 --> 01:20:48,850
I love her facial expression.

1890
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:52,790
(BUMSUP's choreography section)

1891
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:58,020
Hit them with that...

1892
01:20:58,190 --> 01:20:59,389
(I must do this dance.)

1893
01:20:59,390 --> 01:21:00,659
(We're becoming absorbed.)

1894
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:01,730
(Happy)

1895
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,799
They killed it.

1896
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:05,830
(BUMSUP's choreography section)

1897
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:07,630
Yes, no: ze!

1898
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:08,870
Beautiful shot.

1899
01:21:11,570 --> 01:21:12,670
Leejung!

1900
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:14,570
Period!

1901
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,620
- I like Leejung's vibe. - Me too.

1902
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:24,250
I love it. I love this.

1903
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,650
They're not a K-pop group already?

1904
01:21:32,530 --> 01:21:34,490
Oh, that's cool. I never caught on that.

1905
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,370
Go, Hyojin Choi!

1906
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:52,680
Who wants to rock with Jennie?

1907
01:21:55,580 --> 01:21:56,580
Yes, Gabee.

1908
01:21:56,581 --> 01:21:57,950
Like, like, like

1909
01:22:01,220 --> 01:22:03,419
(They begin RHTokyo's choreography section.)

1910
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:04,460
Please.

1911
01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:06,590
I think it'll be hard.

1912
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,399
We did our best for the choreography copy section.

1913
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,099
I hope people will notice.

1914
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:13,020
(Counting down to the choreography copy section)

1915
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:14,900
- Jennie - Hey!

1916
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:16,200
That was a nice bite.

1917
01:22:18,710 --> 01:22:20,439
(RHTokyo's choreography section)

1918
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:21,610
That was a nice bite.

1919
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:25,949
Here it comes.

1920
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:27,249
(Becoming absorbed)

1921
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:29,619
- Go, Aiki! - Yes, Aiki!

1922
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:30,779
(RHTokyo's choreography section)

1923
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:32,020
Go, Aiki!

1924
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:34,990
She sold it.

1925
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:37,989
She sold it.

1926
01:22:37,990 --> 01:22:39,270
(RHTokyo's choreography section)

1927
01:22:45,770 --> 01:22:46,830
Yes, queen!

1928
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:49,040
This is really good.

1929
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:55,079
- Go, Aiki! - Yes!

1930
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,080
Hit that booty, girl.

1931
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:57,510
(Embarrassed)

1932
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:02,950
She's beautiful, right? no: ze.

1933
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:05,220
I love some dynamics.

1934
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:10,190
- Ladies run this - Ladies run this

1935
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,260
Ladies run this

1936
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:16,830
That was really good.

1937
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:20,629
(Well done, BUMSUP.)

1938
01:23:20,630 --> 01:23:21,740
Period.

1939
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:25,110
(Watch carefully. We're the ending fairies.)

1940
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:27,510
You look pretty.

1941
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:29,179
They all have a good face.

1942
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:30,709
She's so pretty.

1943
01:23:30,710 --> 01:23:32,610
(Let's learn from them.)

1944
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:38,990
(Sexy)

1945
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:41,519
(The fight zone goes crazy due to the ending fairy culture.)

1946
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:42,690
What was that?

1947
01:23:43,090 --> 01:23:44,720
What were you doing in your own world?

1948
01:23:45,690 --> 01:23:47,030
I love her.

1949
01:23:47,330 --> 01:23:49,730
She killed me.

1950
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,129
- I think they killed it, though. - Yes.

1951
01:23:53,130 --> 01:23:54,969
- Yes. - They definitely killed it.

1952
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:57,469
I feel like they had a really nice balance,

1953
01:23:57,470 --> 01:24:01,939
that K-pop intricacy of staging, moves,

1954
01:24:01,940 --> 01:24:04,079
a lot of compact formations...

1955
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:07,609
But then there was enough space where they could slow it down.

1956
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:10,719
They could show their movement quality, right?

1957
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:13,789
I couldn't tell that they hadn't been dancing together for long.

1958
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:15,190
- You know, it looked... - Yes.

1959
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:18,530
It looked they had some chemistry in this performance to me.

1960
01:24:18,830 --> 01:24:21,029
It feels like their 3rd or 4th album.

1961
01:24:21,030 --> 01:24:22,030
They're like K-pop artists...

1962
01:24:22,031 --> 01:24:24,399
with their 3rd or 4th album, not 1st.

1963
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,469
They were like...

1964
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:28,070
I totally got that feeling.

1965
01:24:28,170 --> 01:24:29,240
That was great.

1966
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:33,670
Will BUMSUP be able to...

1967
01:24:33,870 --> 01:24:37,110
beat RHTokyo's score of 285 points?

1968
01:24:37,210 --> 01:24:38,380
Be ready to smile.

1969
01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:39,910
And remember that we did well.

1970
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:42,819
I'm so desperate right now.

1971
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:44,649
We really need a win about now.

1972
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:46,550
I really hope that we win.

1973
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:48,349
The probability is low.

1974
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:51,619
Since BUMSUP's performance was like a flow,

1975
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:53,589
our performance would've made more impact.

1976
01:24:53,590 --> 01:24:58,030
So I think the judges will give a higher score to RHTokyo.

1977
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:01,270
What will be the score given by the fight judges?

1978
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:05,000
Team Korea, BUMSUP's fight judge score...

1979
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:06,970
will be revealed.

1980
01:25:07,710 --> 01:25:09,510
I think BUMSUP is going to win.

1981
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:12,079
I would choose RHTokyo though.

1982
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,580
(People have mixed opinions about BUMSUP versus RHTokyo.)

1983
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:16,950
Let's go.

1984
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:20,420
(BUMSUP's fight judge score, 282 points)

1985
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:24,489
As the result of the fight judges' evaluation,

1986
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:26,729
BUMSUP received...

1987
01:25:26,730 --> 01:25:29,030
a score of 282 points.

1988
01:25:29,230 --> 01:25:32,069
At that moment, I was so disappointed...

1989
01:25:32,070 --> 01:25:33,329
by the difference of three points.

1990
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:34,399
(Meanwhile)

1991
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:35,400
What?

1992
01:25:37,170 --> 01:25:39,210
- No way. - I was startled.

1993
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:40,670
We were similar to BUMSUP.

1994
01:25:41,740 --> 01:25:43,739
I thought that we'd win easily.

1995
01:25:43,740 --> 01:25:44,940
That makes no sense.

1996
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:48,680
I was surprised since the difference was so slight.

1997
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:51,579
Actually, when I watched it for the first time,

1998
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:53,989
I thought that was originally BUMSUP's choreography.

1999
01:25:53,990 --> 01:25:54,990
I felt that.

2000
01:25:54,991 --> 01:25:56,089
They were like stars.

2001
01:25:56,090 --> 01:25:58,019
There were so many different characters,

2002
01:25:58,020 --> 01:25:59,029
and they carried that.

2003
01:25:59,030 --> 01:26:00,229
They're showing that right now.

2004
01:26:00,230 --> 01:26:03,529
RHTokyo, I think they are choreography geniuses.

2005
01:26:03,530 --> 01:26:04,659
They were giving them something,

2006
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:06,670
and they were delivering it to the max.

2007
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:10,100
You can give them anything, and they're going to sell it. Yes.

2008
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:11,670
One hundred.

2009
01:26:11,670 --> 01:26:12,670
(In choreography creation, RHTokyo wins.)

2010
01:26:12,670 --> 01:26:13,670
(In choreography expression, BUMSUP wins.)

2011
01:26:13,671 --> 01:26:16,709
But I wanted to see more.

2012
01:26:16,710 --> 01:26:19,109
Not only in their facial expressions,

2013
01:26:19,110 --> 01:26:21,149
but also in their performances,

2014
01:26:21,150 --> 01:26:23,379
I wanted to see more like, "Woah."

2015
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:24,950
Yes. I agree.

2016
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,090
(The fight judges finish scoring the crew.)

2017
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:28,689
(Back Koo Young: 92 points, Ashley Everett: 96 points, )

2018
01:26:28,690 --> 01:26:30,219
(Mike Song: 94 points, Total: 282 points)

2019
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:33,459
Excluding the global public evaluation,

2020
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:36,830
RHTokyo is ahead.

2021
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:39,999
Now, I'll reveal RHTokyo's score...

2022
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,940
for the global public evaluation.

2023
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:44,940
Global voting.

2024
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:47,570
We have confidence in winning.

2025
01:26:47,970 --> 01:26:49,940
It'll be about the number of likes.

2026
01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:51,739
For global public evaluation,

2027
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:54,080
RHTokyo's number of likes is...

2028
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:57,779
I'm looking forward to the likes.

2029
01:26:57,780 --> 01:27:00,049
The viewers will give likes.

2030
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:03,720
The number of views will definitely be high.

2031
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:06,629
- Please show us. - Please do that.

2032
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:08,430
Please show us.

2033
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:13,829
Even if we get 3 million or 1.9 million views...

2034
01:27:13,830 --> 01:27:16,799
The number of likes can be different.

2035
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,299
For the global public evaluation,

2036
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:20,510
RHTokyo's number of likes is...

2037
01:27:20,770 --> 01:27:22,380
(Junna is curious.)

2038
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:24,180
(What will it be?)

2039
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:28,049
So far, RHTokyo has always been number one.

2040
01:27:28,050 --> 01:27:29,179
The number of likes...

2041
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:31,919
is bound to correspond with the number of views.

2042
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:33,750
Please give us a lot of likes.

2043
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:37,890
They received 111,884 likes.

2044
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:42,060
RHTokyo's score for the global public evaluation is...

2045
01:27:42,130 --> 01:27:43,260
I'm scared.

2046
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:54,409
With 1,683,060 views...

2047
01:27:54,410 --> 01:27:58,649
and 111,884 likes,

2048
01:27:58,650 --> 01:28:02,150
their total score is 1,185 points.

2049
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:03,520
Yes.

2050
01:28:04,650 --> 01:28:06,090
- Yes. - Good job.

2051
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:09,920
Now, the two crews' fate lies...

2052
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:13,190
on the number of likes BUMSUP received.

2053
01:28:13,660 --> 01:28:16,229
The number of likes is more honest than the words...

2054
01:28:16,230 --> 01:28:17,929
of any professional dancers or judges.

2055
01:28:17,930 --> 01:28:19,970
Do you think it's going to go for BUMSUP?

2056
01:28:22,570 --> 01:28:23,600
Let's just do it.

2057
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:25,769
I thought that we'd definitely win...

2058
01:28:25,770 --> 01:28:28,269
in the global public evaluation.

2059
01:28:28,270 --> 01:28:30,039
Because of the number of likes,

2060
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,480
we might not be number one.

2061
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:35,280
Even if there are three million views,

2062
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:37,220
people might not like it.

2063
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:41,490
I'll reveal BUMSUP's score for the global public evaluation.

2064
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:43,260
Please.

2065
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,690
(Nervous)

2066
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:52,070
(Shocked)

2067
01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:58,069
(What...)

2068
01:28:58,070 --> 01:28:59,269
(just...)

2069
01:28:59,270 --> 01:29:01,169
(happened?)

2070
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:03,480
(Breathing)

2071
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:08,049
In the global public evaluation, Team Korea, BUMSUP...

2072
01:29:08,050 --> 01:29:12,119
received 3,204,705 views...

2073
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:16,389
and 188,059 likes.

2074
01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:20,590
Their total score is 1,232 points.

2075
01:29:20,860 --> 01:29:22,460
The likes and viewers are proportional.

2076
01:29:23,830 --> 01:29:26,730
(BUMSUP, congratulations.)

2077
01:29:27,030 --> 01:29:31,100
I think BUMSUP's concept was more fitting.

2078
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,739
Well done. You had many emotional struggles.

2079
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:33,740
Thank goodness.

2080
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:35,980
We won for the first time.

2081
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:38,080
- For the 1st time. - We won for the 1st time.

2082
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:40,879
(We won.)

2083
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,249
I was so happy.

2084
01:29:42,250 --> 01:29:44,080
I felt bad for the other crew, but...

2085
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:46,120
It was so satisfying. I was relieved.

2086
01:29:47,390 --> 01:29:49,320
We lost.

2087
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:51,360
I'm very disappointed,

2088
01:29:51,690 --> 01:29:55,030
but I chose the opposing team myself.

2089
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:57,330
I accepted the result.

2090
01:29:57,430 --> 01:30:01,500
I don't want to take the risk of getting eliminated,

2091
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,700
so I'll work hard.

2092
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:07,370
In the Jennie match, RHTokyo lost.

2093
01:30:07,470 --> 01:30:10,940
In the GD match, OSAKA Ojo Gang lost.

2094
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:13,179
The crew with a lower score,

2095
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:17,319
OSAKA Ojo Gang, will participate in the Elimination Battle.

2096
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:19,049
(OSAKA Ojo Gang, will participate in the Elimination Battle.)

2097
01:30:19,050 --> 01:30:21,089
Thus, the result...

2098
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:23,390
of the remaining match will decide...

2099
01:30:23,490 --> 01:30:26,989
whether RHTokyo will go to the Elimination Battle...

2100
01:30:26,990 --> 01:30:28,730
or survive.

2101
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:33,200
If RHTokyo scores lower than the losing crew...

2102
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:34,630
of the last match,

2103
01:30:34,830 --> 01:30:39,670
they will participate in the Elimination Battle.

2104
01:30:39,970 --> 01:30:40,970
Interesting.

2105
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:43,740
We'll be fine no matter who our opponents are.

2106
01:30:43,910 --> 01:30:45,509
I don't want that.

2107
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:49,920
What twist will the result of the last match bring?

2108
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:52,389
It's going to be a hectic battle.

2109
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:53,890
The show is crazy.

2110
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:57,620
The World of K-pop Mission comes with the first elimination.

2111
01:30:57,890 --> 01:30:59,206
I'll announce the result of the aespa match,

2112
01:30:59,230 --> 01:31:03,730
AG SQUAD versus ROYAL FAMILY.

2113
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:05,230
Let's go.

2114
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,670
Let's go, y'all.

2115
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:10,539
Let's go.

2116
01:31:10,540 --> 01:31:11,540
(Nervous)

2117
01:31:11,541 --> 01:31:13,469
I feel like a lot of them are...

2118
01:31:13,470 --> 01:31:14,609
There's an interesting dynamic.

2119
01:31:14,610 --> 01:31:16,979
There's some crossover in this dance community...

2120
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:19,149
between ROYAL FAMILY and AG SQUAD.

2121
01:31:19,150 --> 01:31:20,209
- Yes. - So I think...

2122
01:31:20,210 --> 01:31:22,320
there's a crossover in styles.

2123
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:25,819
I'd be curious to see how different...

2124
01:31:25,820 --> 01:31:28,090
ROYAL FAMILY and AG SQUAD are.

2125
01:31:28,590 --> 01:31:31,860
Firstly, I'll reveal the scores for the Class Mission.

2126
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:35,289
It's a tie.

2127
01:31:35,290 --> 01:31:36,399
They chose each other...

2128
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:37,640
- as the worst dancer. - Right.

2129
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:41,029
ROYAL FAMILY gave us the worst dancer,

2130
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:42,600
so we lost 50 points.

2131
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,370
It could've been 100.

2132
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:47,040
They're starting off with the same score.

2133
01:31:47,570 --> 01:31:50,240
We'll make sure that the new generation is strong.

2134
01:31:50,980 --> 01:31:53,210
I definitely think we can win.

2135
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:56,849
Five, six, seven... Hold.

2136
01:31:56,850 --> 01:31:59,489
Me, Kyra, Ruthy Baby, and Kaleece are from the ROYAL FAMILY.

2137
01:31:59,490 --> 01:32:02,560
So it felt really good on our bodies. It felt natural.

2138
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:05,259
When we used to do this kind of thing for ROYAL FAMILY,

2139
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:07,689
Kyra would always learn it and we'd wait.

2140
01:32:07,690 --> 01:32:09,229
Then she'd come and teach us.

2141
01:32:09,230 --> 01:32:10,500
(Teacher Kyra is feeling shy.)

2142
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:12,270
Speed it up. One, go two...

2143
01:32:13,370 --> 01:32:15,329
(Thanks to Teacher Kyra, the practice proceeds speedily.)

2144
01:32:15,330 --> 01:32:17,570
If Teesha does it, we're doing what Teesha does.

2145
01:32:17,770 --> 01:32:19,509
Keep your hands out here. And it goes...

2146
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:20,809
(Do it like this.)

2147
01:32:20,810 --> 01:32:21,970
Yes. Stop.

2148
01:32:22,740 --> 01:32:23,880
Let's do the face.

2149
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:25,880
A bit sexy.

2150
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:27,950
Hold.

2151
01:32:28,050 --> 01:32:30,580
That's so hot. They weren't hot.

2152
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:34,320
We're doing the same dance, but we're actually pretty different.

2153
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:36,910
(Practice goes smoothly for the choreography copy section.)

2154
01:32:39,090 --> 01:32:40,359
(ROYAL FAMILY arrives at the practice room.)

2155
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:41,560
- Hey. - Hey.

2156
01:32:41,660 --> 01:32:43,600
I think we should just do it.

2157
01:32:44,730 --> 01:32:45,869
(AG SQUAD is choreographing their own section...)

2158
01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:47,206
(after practicing for the copy section.)

2159
01:32:47,230 --> 01:32:49,346
(ROYAL FAMILY members stand still instead of practicing.)

2160
01:32:49,370 --> 01:32:52,069
I was wondering about AG SQUAD's concept.

2161
01:32:52,070 --> 01:32:53,810
(Glancing over)

2162
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:57,109
(Glancing over)

2163
01:32:57,110 --> 01:32:58,279
They're doing this.

2164
01:32:58,280 --> 01:32:59,509
(This movement)

2165
01:32:59,510 --> 01:33:00,510
I'll show you later.

2166
01:33:01,110 --> 01:33:02,880
- Can I see? - Can I see?

2167
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:04,750
They're rolling their eyes.

2168
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,366
They're figuring out our choreography.

2169
01:33:06,390 --> 01:33:08,190
This is why you shouldn't do this.

2170
01:33:08,290 --> 01:33:12,430
I was kind of curious, I guess.

2171
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:15,460
So I just did a little bit of a side eye.

2172
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:17,730
(Staring intently)

2173
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,129
We have to gather.

2174
01:33:19,130 --> 01:33:20,770
- This is not as comfortable. - This one.

2175
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:22,669
- Try to do a circle. - After we do that?

2176
01:33:22,670 --> 01:33:24,040
(Circular formation)

2177
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:25,540
(Glancing over)

2178
01:33:25,740 --> 01:33:26,970
How about the circle idea?

2179
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:30,279
They're doing it for the same song.

2180
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:31,540
They got the idea.

2181
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:34,450
It inspires them too.

2182
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:37,930
- I know. They're making it better. - They're changing it.

2183
01:33:38,990 --> 01:33:40,620
It was very uncomfortable.

2184
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:44,419
(At that moment, Kaea approaches the production crew.)

2185
01:33:44,420 --> 01:33:45,859
We don't want them to see it.

2186
01:33:45,860 --> 01:33:47,190
We don't want to show each other.

2187
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:49,330
It was just a very awkward environment.

2188
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:51,400
We can just go outside.

2189
01:33:52,570 --> 01:33:54,650
- Should we just walk outside? - Are we not allowed?

2190
01:33:54,970 --> 01:33:55,970
Where did they go?

2191
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:58,369
With having ROYAL FAMILY right there,

2192
01:33:58,370 --> 01:34:00,210
we didn't want to give away our routine.

2193
01:34:00,310 --> 01:34:03,609
We didn't want them to be able to be like, "They've done that."

2194
01:34:03,610 --> 01:34:05,009
"Maybe we should do this."

2195
01:34:05,010 --> 01:34:06,010
I don't like that.

2196
01:34:06,350 --> 01:34:07,779
I didn't fully look over,

2197
01:34:07,780 --> 01:34:10,179
but I just did a little bit of a side eye.

2198
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:12,080
I feel like their choreography...

2199
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:15,089
isn't as good as ours.

2200
01:34:15,090 --> 01:34:16,090
(Scratching her head)

2201
01:34:17,890 --> 01:34:20,460
(With AG SQUAD gone, they begin to practice in earnest.)

2202
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:22,030
This is our magic trick.

2203
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:26,700
It's kind of a ROYAL FAMILY staple.

2204
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:29,500
It takes a lot of synchronicity.

2205
01:34:29,970 --> 01:34:31,570
We've pulled it out before.

2206
01:34:32,370 --> 01:34:33,939
AG SQUAD was in the room,

2207
01:34:33,940 --> 01:34:36,379
and we didn't want to showcase our moves yet.

2208
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:39,350
We want to really wow them on the day of the performance.

2209
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:41,449
And then it's our concept.

2210
01:34:41,450 --> 01:34:45,119
It's kind of giving futuristic robot vibes,

2211
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:48,719
but also paying homage to the original ReQuest...

2212
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:49,890
from 2009.

2213
01:34:50,390 --> 01:34:52,430
So we're going back to our roots.

2214
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:55,389
AG SQUAD is focusing on ourselves.

2215
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:57,299
And we're staying true to ourselves.

2216
01:34:57,300 --> 01:34:59,430
And we know what to bring on stage tomorrow.

2217
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:02,599
(Choreography rehearsal day for World of K-pop Mission)

2218
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:04,840
I can't wait to see this routine.

2219
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:07,670
Let's go, AG SQUAD!

2220
01:35:07,870 --> 01:35:09,909
(AG SQUAD's final rehearsal begins.)

2221
01:35:09,910 --> 01:35:12,610
I wanted to showcase our strengths...

2222
01:35:12,810 --> 01:35:15,210
and make our bodies look like artworks.

2223
01:35:16,650 --> 01:35:18,720
(Their jaws drop.)

2224
01:35:19,490 --> 01:35:20,570
They have so much strength.

2225
01:35:21,150 --> 01:35:22,220
(Amazed)

2226
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:23,460
We expected that.

2227
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:25,690
We are not surprised.

2228
01:35:26,030 --> 01:35:27,890
They know how to bring out the K-pop vibe.

2229
01:35:31,830 --> 01:35:33,799
(Counting down to the choreography copy section)

2230
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:35,970
(ROYAL FAMILY's copy section starts!)

2231
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:37,340
Doesn't that look too obvious?

2232
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:40,840
So quiet.

2233
01:35:41,740 --> 01:35:44,310
(Synchronized)

2234
01:35:44,410 --> 01:35:45,850
(AG SQUAD's final rehearsal ends.)

2235
01:35:46,910 --> 01:35:49,080
- That was fire. - Yes.

2236
01:35:49,180 --> 01:35:51,079
- They're really good. - Perhaps they don't know...

2237
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:52,566
- that we're filming tomorrow. - I know.

2238
01:35:52,590 --> 01:35:54,389
To do something like this with someone else's choreography...

2239
01:35:54,390 --> 01:35:55,420
is crazy.

2240
01:35:55,650 --> 01:35:58,919
AG SQUAD thinks that their choreography is better.

2241
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:01,459
But also a part of their choreography...

2242
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:03,299
is ROYAL FAMILY's in the style.

2243
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:05,130
It's similar to ROYAL FAMILY's.

2244
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,899
(ROYAL FAMILY's final rehearsal begins.)

2245
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:11,540
We just want to show everyone that we're better than AG SQUAD.

2246
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:13,210
(Impressed)

2247
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:14,410
I like the beginning.

2248
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:16,710
I want to see something new.

2249
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:21,010
(ROYAL FAMILY's choreography section)

2250
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:22,450
It's the same.

2251
01:36:22,780 --> 01:36:24,750
- It's kind of like the same... - Idea.

2252
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:28,089
(Circular formation)

2253
01:36:28,090 --> 01:36:30,050
AG SQUAD had a circular formation as well, right?

2254
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:31,720
They think similarly.

2255
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:35,230
(They show their secret weapon!)

2256
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:40,199
That was so impressive. They were down here.

2257
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:41,230
(Let's give it a try.)

2258
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:45,370
ROYAL FAMILY's wow moment was shocking.

2259
01:36:45,670 --> 01:36:48,030
They didn't do the lift yesterday. They did something else.

2260
01:36:48,310 --> 01:36:50,410
(Counting down to the choreography copy section)

2261
01:36:50,510 --> 01:36:52,040
(AG SQUAD's copy section starts!)

2262
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:54,080
(Long legs)

2263
01:36:54,081 --> 01:36:55,679
They're all tall,

2264
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:57,961
so their legs go up this high. It's almost to our height.

2265
01:36:58,520 --> 01:36:59,749
It's really incredible.

2266
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:01,089
(Technique section)

2267
01:37:01,090 --> 01:37:02,190
Harmz can do a flip too.

2268
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:05,890
They didn't do it well. We're better with the copy section.

2269
01:37:06,130 --> 01:37:08,330
Watching the two crews in succession...

2270
01:37:08,730 --> 01:37:10,029
highlights how similar their formulas are...

2271
01:37:10,030 --> 01:37:12,100
in terms of which move they add and when.

2272
01:37:12,330 --> 01:37:14,169
- Similar. - They got inspirations,

2273
01:37:14,170 --> 01:37:15,170
and they got ideas.

2274
01:37:15,171 --> 01:37:16,640
We're so similar to ROYAL FAMILY.

2275
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,710
Our routine, surprisingly, had ended up being similar.

2276
01:37:20,910 --> 01:37:22,170
We do a lift.

2277
01:37:22,610 --> 01:37:23,840
And we circle her.

2278
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:25,679
(ROYAL FAMILY realized that AG SQUAD had the same move.)

2279
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:26,710
(What?)

2280
01:37:27,210 --> 01:37:28,210
They copied us.

2281
01:37:28,211 --> 01:37:30,479
They didn't do the lift yesterday. They did something else.

2282
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:31,979
Then they changed it so that it was the same as ours.

2283
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:34,490
They got inspirations, and they got ideas.

2284
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:37,560
They didn't have their own kind of style.

2285
01:37:37,790 --> 01:37:40,190
Everyone will be very impressed with our routine.

2286
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:41,889
(AG SQUAD receives feedback from other crews.)

2287
01:37:41,890 --> 01:37:44,900
- They're pretty straight out. - Yes, they're straight out.

2288
01:37:45,130 --> 01:37:47,500
- Half? - Half.

2289
01:37:48,130 --> 01:37:49,300
"Not as clear."

2290
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:53,810
"Just don't be overwhelmed by ROYAL FAMILY's power."

2291
01:37:53,910 --> 01:37:56,439
ROYAL FAMILY did this. They've done it for years.

2292
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:58,379
I feel like we need to do something...

2293
01:37:58,380 --> 01:37:59,380
to go up.

2294
01:38:00,150 --> 01:38:01,909
I was so shocked by the result...

2295
01:38:01,910 --> 01:38:03,650
because we had been rehearsing a lot.

2296
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:06,620
Make it better. Get it better.

2297
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:09,460
Once again, we might get called pretty similar.

2298
01:38:09,790 --> 01:38:12,559
We're trying to create something new we haven't seen before.

2299
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:13,560
That's the goal.

2300
01:38:13,561 --> 01:38:14,789
- Well, however that went... - Yes.

2301
01:38:14,790 --> 01:38:16,560
Fix it and drill it until we go home.

2302
01:38:16,930 --> 01:38:21,900
(The war of nerves is intense. What will become of the two crews?)

2303
01:38:22,170 --> 01:38:26,940
Now, we'll watch AG SQUAD's video first.

2304
01:38:27,470 --> 01:38:28,940
(I'm excited.)

2305
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:32,609
AG SQUAD. All of them have a lot of charisma.

2306
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:33,779
They just own the moment.

2307
01:38:33,780 --> 01:38:35,879
Just a lot of superstar talents.

2308
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:37,220
I'm excited.

2309
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:39,080
Let's see how different...

2310
01:38:39,890 --> 01:38:43,790
New choreography, new ideas... Not ROYAL FAMILY.

2311
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:45,190
Let's go.

2312
01:38:45,890 --> 01:38:47,430
(Junna is excited.)

2313
01:38:48,290 --> 01:38:49,299
(Whatever)

2314
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:50,630
Show us the receipts.

2315
01:38:56,340 --> 01:38:58,500
The way they're standing shows their originality.

2316
01:38:59,870 --> 01:39:01,869
(Listen on Spotify)

2317
01:39:01,870 --> 01:39:02,979
Come on. Hit them with the "Shoot."

("Armageddon," "Drama," and "Whiplash" by aespa)

2319
01:39:07,250 --> 01:39:09,080
They just command the stage.

2320
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:10,350
It's cool.

2321
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:13,920
It's just like, "Isn't this cool?" Right?

2322
01:39:14,190 --> 01:39:16,520
And that's it, right?

2323
01:39:26,070 --> 01:39:27,630
Born like a queen

2324
01:39:27,730 --> 01:39:28,730
Yes!

2325
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:30,100
The choreography is nice.

2326
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:31,840
I agree.

2327
01:39:36,610 --> 01:39:37,610
There you go.

2328
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:39,350
It's so clean.

2329
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:45,220
Come on, Ruthy Baby!

2330
01:39:47,350 --> 01:39:49,120
(We love it.)

2331
01:39:51,020 --> 01:39:52,020
I love this part.

2332
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:54,630
The power and balance are just right.

2333
01:39:55,660 --> 01:39:56,999
Yes!

2334
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,199
Yes!

2335
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:00,070
Hey, Ruthy Baby!

2336
01:40:00,530 --> 01:40:02,940
(They show perfect synchronization.)

2337
01:40:05,970 --> 01:40:07,110
Come on, Kaleece.

2338
01:40:09,140 --> 01:40:10,780
Amazing.

2339
01:40:15,110 --> 01:40:16,520
Let's go, Vanessa!

2340
01:40:20,350 --> 01:40:22,089
That's insane.

2341
01:40:22,090 --> 01:40:23,620
I like the formation here.

2342
01:40:23,990 --> 01:40:25,489
Yes, Vanessa!

2343
01:40:25,490 --> 01:40:28,330
Vanessa too. Vanessa got the whole vibe.

2344
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:36,900
- Aaliyah is a star. - Yes.

2345
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,240
Yes, Aaliyah.

2346
01:40:44,810 --> 01:40:46,349
- She's good. - She's so cute.

2347

(AG SQUAD's choreography section)

2348
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:50,819
- Period. - Yes, girl.

2349
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:53,820
(AG SQUAD's choreography section)

2350
01:41:00,130 --> 01:41:03,260
Having that balance created some dynamics.

2351
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:05,060
Dynamics.

2352
01:41:07,470 --> 01:41:08,590
They're really good at this.

2353
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:09,800
- They're clever. - Yes.

2354
01:41:12,070 --> 01:41:13,939
Their choice of white gloves show their experience.

2355
01:41:13,940 --> 01:41:15,510
They know that the gloves stand out.

2356
01:41:24,420 --> 01:41:25,449
Here it comes.

2357
01:41:25,450 --> 01:41:26,690
It's the copy section.

2358
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:28,650
We'll do it better.

2359
01:41:28,850 --> 01:41:29,859
Book us.

2360
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:31,160

2367

Work, girl.

2368
01:41:49,580 --> 01:41:50,880
Aaliyah, let's go.

2369
01:41:53,910 --> 01:41:55,010
Work, girl.

2370
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:57,079
I personally think that they're better.

2371
01:41:57,080 --> 01:41:58,579
You're right. They're better.

2372
01:41:58,580 --> 01:41:59,590
(No way.)

2373
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:03,220
That's cool.

2374
01:42:05,060 --> 01:42:06,890
This is insane!

2375
01:42:08,530 --> 01:42:09,830
Come on, Aaliyah!

2376
01:42:10,030 --> 01:42:11,200
They're really giving.

2377
01:42:14,070 --> 01:42:15,390
- Whip, whiplash - Whip, whiplash

2378
01:42:18,570 --> 01:42:20,210
Period!

2379

- Period! - Period!

2380
01:42:22,770 --> 01:42:23,779
Oh, my neck.

2381
01:42:23,780 --> 01:42:25,280
Ouchies!

2382
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:28,279
She reused that last moment.

2383
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:29,749
Yes!

2384
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:31,120
I feel like that too.

2385
01:42:31,780 --> 01:42:33,189
Good job, ladies.

2386
01:42:33,190 --> 01:42:34,549
Period!

2387
01:42:34,550 --> 01:42:36,149
Let's see the ending fairy.

2388
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:37,590
How will be the close-up shot?

2389
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:39,320
Period!

2390
01:42:41,130 --> 01:42:43,260
- She's insane. - I love it.

2391
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:45,660
(Embarrassed)

2392
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,770
(So cool)

2393
01:42:49,130 --> 01:42:50,340
AQ SQUAD...

2394
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,469
gave us moments...

2395
01:42:52,470 --> 01:42:54,109
- in every chapter... - Yes.

2396
01:42:54,110 --> 01:42:55,509
- to remember. - Yes.

2397
01:42:55,510 --> 01:42:57,239
- And it felt like K-pop. - Yes.

2398
01:42:57,240 --> 01:42:59,849
And it felt like them. It felt true to them too.

2399
01:42:59,850 --> 01:43:01,979
They have nice strength. They have a nice routine.

2400
01:43:01,980 --> 01:43:03,379
The balance was just right.

2401
01:43:03,380 --> 01:43:04,480
They choreographed well.

2402
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:08,589
Team Australia, AG SQUAD's...

2403
01:43:08,590 --> 01:43:10,420
fight judge score.

2404
01:43:10,860 --> 01:43:11,920
I'm curious.

2405
01:43:12,260 --> 01:43:14,189
I think they'll get the perfect score.

2406
01:43:14,190 --> 01:43:15,660
I bet it's very high.

2407
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:18,400
We should be better than ROYAL FAMILY.

2408
01:43:19,130 --> 01:43:21,400
No, we'll be better than AG SQUAD.

2409
01:43:21,730 --> 01:43:23,899
I think, overall, from top to bottom,

2410
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:26,939
their performance was really solid.

2411
01:43:26,940 --> 01:43:28,540
Yes.

2412
01:43:28,910 --> 01:43:32,440
They did great with giving a challenge...

2413
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:34,610
of swapping the choreography.

2414
01:43:34,980 --> 01:43:37,619
Sometimes, when dancers say things with their lips,

2415
01:43:37,620 --> 01:43:38,849
I feel like it's hit-or-miss.

2416
01:43:38,850 --> 01:43:41,419
Yes. You know the right time to do it.

2417
01:43:41,420 --> 01:43:43,759
It was done exactly at the right time.

2418
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:45,660
(Intricate details and precise timing)

2419
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:49,629
The highest points the fight judge gave...

2420
01:43:49,630 --> 01:43:53,599
to AG SQUAD was 98 points.

2421
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,629
(The highest fight judge score, 98 points)

2422
01:43:55,630 --> 01:43:56,699
Ninety-eight?

2423
01:43:56,700 --> 01:43:59,940
Girl, I've never gotten that score. In school, I always got 50...

2424
01:44:00,210 --> 01:44:01,210
or 40.

2425
01:44:01,211 --> 01:44:02,939
(Laughing)

2426
01:44:02,940 --> 01:44:04,839
Now, I'll reveal the score...

2427
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:06,880
the fight judges gave.

2428
01:44:11,050 --> 01:44:12,330
Isn't it the highest one so far?

2429
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:13,590
It's high.

2430
01:44:13,690 --> 01:44:15,650
(What's the fight judge score for AG SQUAD?)

2431
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:17,760
Is that higher?

2432
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:19,320
Good job, people.

2433
01:44:20,090 --> 01:44:21,360
They're the best.

2434
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:24,360
It's really good.

2435
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:28,830
We really felt like we did deserve that.

2436
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:32,039
And it was amazing to hear that recognition...

2437
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:33,669
from the judges, finally.

2438
01:44:33,670 --> 01:44:36,140
That means each judge gave a score of 95 points or higher.

2439
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:38,540
It's a really high score.

2440
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:42,150
We could've had 100 each.

2441
01:44:42,780 --> 01:44:45,850
I guess we'll have more points...

2442
01:44:46,020 --> 01:44:48,119
than AG SQUAD.

2443
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:50,760
Now, ROYAL FAMILY...

2444
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:53,259
I was feeling confident.

2445
01:44:53,260 --> 01:44:54,759
I think we did good.

2446
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:57,800
I definitely think we have a great chance of winning.

2447
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:00,100
All together, it'll make us win.

2448
01:45:00,430 --> 01:45:01,430
We'll sweep.

2449
01:45:01,431 --> 01:45:03,740
I do feel confident in us.

2450
01:45:04,070 --> 01:45:07,110
How will be the fight judges' evaluation?

2451
01:45:07,570 --> 01:45:09,269
This is like, honestly...

2452
01:45:09,270 --> 01:45:10,409
This is a brand.

2453
01:45:10,410 --> 01:45:11,979
- Yes, it is. - This is a brand.

2454
01:45:11,980 --> 01:45:13,110
- It is. Yes. - Yes.

2455
01:45:13,550 --> 01:45:16,579
Will they receive a score...

2456
01:45:16,580 --> 01:45:18,979
that's higher than AG SQUAD's?

2457
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:20,090
They never know.

2458
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:21,720
Who knows?

2459
01:45:21,950 --> 01:45:25,020
Let's now watch the video of ROYAL FAMILY,

2460
01:45:25,290 --> 01:45:28,190
the other crew that's competing in the aespa match.

2461
01:45:29,230 --> 01:45:31,030
- Let's go, y'all. - Let's go.

2462
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:32,680
We're going to watch their video now.

2463

- Let's do it. - Let's go.

2468
01:45:57,520 --> 01:45:58,520
Nice.

2469
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:10,199
- My goodness. - All right.

2470
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:11,200
That's so harsh.

2471
01:46:11,770 --> 01:46:12,770
Crazy.

2472
01:46:21,150 --> 01:46:22,150
Nice facial expression.

2473
01:46:22,210 --> 01:46:24,380
The concept is intense. It's fun.

2474
01:46:25,850 --> 01:46:27,590
All right. Period.

2475
01:46:28,090 --> 01:46:29,290
(Oh, my)

2476
01:46:32,260 --> 01:46:33,260
That's crazy.

2477
01:46:34,330 --> 01:46:35,790
Yes, this one is better.

2478
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:39,100
Harmz.

2479
01:46:40,930 --> 01:46:42,099
Her muscles are insane.

2481
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:44,770
She's ripped.

2482
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:46,910
Look at her body.

2483
01:46:47,210 --> 01:46:49,270
Her muscles are insane.

2484
01:47:06,260 --> 01:47:07,459
Smart choreography.

2485
01:47:07,460 --> 01:47:10,530
Yes. Smart choreography that makes an impact that you remember.

I wonder how they managed to...

2488
01:47:18,270 --> 01:47:19,270
do the breaking moves?

2489
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:20,440
It's a difficult trick.

2490
01:47:20,441 --> 01:47:23,010
You can't know how to do a flip in one day.

2491
01:47:24,110 --> 01:47:26,949
(AG SQUAD's choreography section)

2492
01:47:26,950 --> 01:47:28,310
(Easy)

2493
01:47:28,650 --> 01:47:29,879
Impressive! She did it.

2494
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:31,220
(Impressive!)

2495
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:33,350
Look at those tricks we can do.

2496
01:47:36,020 --> 01:47:37,819
- Oh, yes. They killed it. - Yes.

2497
01:47:37,820 --> 01:47:39,389
They were great. They were wonderful.

2498
01:47:39,390 --> 01:47:42,530
(AG SQUAD's choreography section)

2499
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:51,039
Yes! You'd better focus!

2500
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:52,999
It's a total iconic dance move.

2501
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,240
- Yes. - Nice, Maiya.

2502
01:47:57,080 --> 01:47:58,809
Yes! You'd better focus!

2503
01:47:58,810 --> 01:48:00,290
She pulled it off with determination.

2504
01:48:00,550 --> 01:48:02,210
This is crazy. There are so many moves.

2505
01:48:02,750 --> 01:48:04,750
There are a lot of materials.

2506
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:08,290
I love Teesha.

2507
01:48:09,350 --> 01:48:12,490
(ROYAL FAMILY's choreography section)

2508
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:20,369
The lines.

2509
01:48:20,370 --> 01:48:21,370
Yes.

2510
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,210
Yes. That wasn't a hard section for them to give to someone else.

2511
01:48:35,710 --> 01:48:36,720
Come on, Mo!

2512
01:48:38,550 --> 01:48:41,349
It's so interesting to see the contrast of the choices here.

2513
01:48:41,350 --> 01:48:42,350
Yes.

2514
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:46,890
Look at that neck!

2515
01:48:47,490 --> 01:48:48,830
Yes to the angle.

2516
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:51,660
Oh, my gosh.

2517
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:55,069
(The ending...)

2518
01:48:55,070 --> 01:48:56,070
(fairy?)

2519
01:48:58,570 --> 01:48:59,570
(Laughing)

2520
01:48:59,571 --> 01:49:00,640
(How cute)

2521
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:05,609
(The youngest crew's pink ending makes everyone laugh.)

2522
01:49:05,610 --> 01:49:07,480
I can't believe it!

2523
01:49:07,550 --> 01:49:08,610
I can't believe it!

2524
01:49:09,450 --> 01:49:11,049
Y'all better still be focused!

2525
01:49:11,050 --> 01:49:13,350
Hit it!

2526
01:49:14,350 --> 01:49:15,949
Character! Yes!

2527
01:49:15,950 --> 01:49:18,260
You can't never do that as a gyaru, right?

2528
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:19,720
Of course not.

2529
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:22,890
- They came out... - Yes.

2530
01:49:23,090 --> 01:49:25,030
- and shot out that cannon. - Yes.

2531
01:49:25,130 --> 01:49:28,499
- They had a particular concept... - Yes.

2532
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:31,669
With their wigs and silver costumes.

2533
01:49:31,670 --> 01:49:32,769
I really loved that.

2534
01:49:32,770 --> 01:49:37,479
From the top to the bottom, they kept up with their characters.

2535
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:38,539
- It was really... - Yes.

2536
01:49:38,540 --> 01:49:40,850
Clean, nice, and in unison.

2537
01:49:41,080 --> 01:49:43,279
The pictures were actually pretty K-pop.

2538
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:46,019
They made it with their energy and performance. Yes.

2539
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:49,959
Because the pictures, transitions, a lot of the formations...

2540
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:51,020
Yes.

2541
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:53,790
That one's so much better.

2542
01:49:54,190 --> 01:49:57,000
(We did well.)

2543
01:49:57,060 --> 01:49:59,030
It was way better than their usual.

2544
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:03,669
It does look fresh. They're fresher, younger people.

2545
01:50:03,670 --> 01:50:06,910
I definitely think they did well with it.

2546
01:50:08,570 --> 01:50:10,210
Now, it's a problem.

2547
01:50:10,780 --> 01:50:12,540
(The leader, Kaea, looks unhappy.)

2548
01:50:12,980 --> 01:50:15,509
I mean, they did the loser sign and made our sign.

2549
01:50:15,510 --> 01:50:17,019
So that doesn't...

2550
01:50:17,020 --> 01:50:19,340
(It was a provocative gesture that was aimed at AG SQUAD.)

2551
01:50:21,590 --> 01:50:24,160
I mean, I felt annoyed because...

2552
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:28,090
they were pretty much disrespecting AG SQUAD.

2553
01:50:28,130 --> 01:50:31,030
ROYAL FAMILY definitely made a mistake by doing that.

2554
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:35,369
We faced many challenges on the day of filming.

2555
01:50:35,370 --> 01:50:38,399
All things considered, I think we did great.

2556
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:40,809
And, yes. I do want to give props to AG SQUAD.

2557
01:50:40,810 --> 01:50:42,809
We loved yours as well.

2558
01:50:42,810 --> 01:50:43,979
We don't have much to say.

2559
01:50:43,980 --> 01:50:46,749
I'm proud of that. I'm proud of the girls.

2560
01:50:46,750 --> 01:50:47,810
Yes. Thank you.

2561
01:50:50,350 --> 01:50:53,020
We girls are feeling really confident.

2562
01:50:53,890 --> 01:50:56,650
Will the ROYAL FAMILY's...

2563
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:59,090
fight judge score...

2564
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:02,489
be higher than AG SQUAD's fight judge score...

2565
01:51:02,490 --> 01:51:04,130
of 291 points?

2566
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:05,600
What will happen?

2567
01:51:06,870 --> 01:51:10,039
This is wild. I'm sweating.

2568
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:11,540
(Nervous)

2569
01:51:12,070 --> 01:51:16,370
The lowest points the fight judge gave...

2570
01:51:16,470 --> 01:51:18,610
to ROYAL FAMILY was...

2571
01:51:19,340 --> 01:51:21,280
(The lowest points?)

2572
01:51:21,410 --> 01:51:23,820
Ninety-five points.

2573
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:25,319
(My goodness)

2574
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:26,619
Ninety-five.

2575
01:51:26,620 --> 01:51:28,449
We got 98, though.

2576
01:51:28,450 --> 01:51:29,649
We might be close again.

2577
01:51:29,650 --> 01:51:32,519
Our lowest score is 95. That's pretty good.

2578
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:33,590
- Period. - Nice.

2579
01:51:33,890 --> 01:51:36,930
I think the difference will be 1 or 2 points.

2580
01:51:37,660 --> 01:51:39,130
This show is crazy.

2581
01:51:40,170 --> 01:51:42,129
Team New Zealand,

2582
01:51:42,130 --> 01:51:44,900
ROYAL FAMILY's fight judge score is...

2583
01:51:48,310 --> 01:51:50,339
We just want to share with the world...

2584
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:53,880
our rawness, new energy, and new vibe that we're bringing.

2585
01:51:56,410 --> 01:51:57,919
Losing is not an option.

2586
01:51:57,920 --> 01:51:59,520
And we will fight to win.

2587
01:52:02,250 --> 01:52:03,689
Come on. Be slow for real.

2588
01:52:03,690 --> 01:52:05,819
I hate the suspense. It's so annoying.

2589
01:52:05,820 --> 01:52:07,530
- Oh, man. - Come on.

2590
01:52:08,190 --> 01:52:10,860
- ROYAL FAMILY will win. - AG SQUAD, we're going to win.

2591
01:52:11,230 --> 01:52:12,630
You guys decide that.

2592
01:52:13,100 --> 01:52:15,300
I'll reveal it now.

2593
01:52:15,430 --> 01:52:17,770
Oh, my gosh.

2594
01:52:21,110 --> 01:52:22,786
(It's AG SQUAD versus ROYAL FAMILY. Which crew will be victorious?)

2595
01:52:22,810 --> 01:52:26,440
(What will be ROYAL FAMILY's fight judge score?)

2596
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:32,949
Currently, AG SQUAD is leading.

2597
01:52:32,950 --> 01:52:35,520
(AG SQUAD is leading with the fight judge score.)

2598
01:52:35,550 --> 01:52:36,749
(Back Koo Young: 95 points, Ashley Everett: 96 points, )

2599
01:52:36,750 --> 01:52:37,819
(Mike Song: 95 points, Total: 286 points)

2600
01:52:37,820 --> 01:52:39,819
(While judging the two crews' choreography copy section)

2601
01:52:39,820 --> 01:52:41,889
Not a challenge, right?

2602
01:52:41,890 --> 01:52:44,029
Yes. It seemed like it was very easy for them...

2603
01:52:44,030 --> 01:52:45,999
- to pick that up. - Yes.

2604
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,899
I kind of think they did it cleaner.

2605
01:52:48,900 --> 01:52:49,900
Yes.

2606
01:52:49,901 --> 01:52:51,940
Honestly, I was expecting the worst.

2607
01:52:52,540 --> 01:52:54,310
So it's five points.

2608
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:58,579
- Only by 5? - Only by 5. Yes.

2609
01:52:58,580 --> 01:53:01,710
Excluding the global public evaluation,

2610
01:53:01,780 --> 01:53:04,880
AG SQUAD is ahead.

2611
01:53:05,050 --> 01:53:06,120
However,

2612
01:53:07,290 --> 01:53:10,690
the global public evaluation remains.

2613
01:53:10,990 --> 01:53:13,830
AG SQUAD might lose because of the public voting.

2614
01:53:13,930 --> 01:53:17,129
A high view count helps a lot.

2615
01:53:17,130 --> 01:53:18,929
For the global public evaluation,

2616
01:53:18,930 --> 01:53:21,000
AG SQUAD's views...

2617
01:53:21,100 --> 01:53:24,600
are 1,618,803.

2618
01:53:25,870 --> 01:53:29,239
ROYAL FAMILY's views...

2619
01:53:29,240 --> 01:53:33,040
are 1,859,645.

2620
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:37,080
In terms of views, ROYAL FAMILY is ahead.

2621
01:53:37,420 --> 01:53:40,520
I think it might be the public vote that gives us a win.

2622
01:53:41,550 --> 01:53:42,649
(Worried)

2623
01:53:42,650 --> 01:53:44,289
I think AG SQUAD is going to lose...

2624
01:53:44,290 --> 01:53:45,889
- However, - in this moment.

2625
01:53:45,890 --> 01:53:49,289
How will the likes change the result?

2626
01:53:49,290 --> 01:53:51,199
- The difference is 200,000. - It isn't a big difference.

2627
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:52,960
The number of likes could change the result.

2628
01:53:53,030 --> 01:53:54,769
Our views were higher.

2629
01:53:54,770 --> 01:53:57,069
We did think that it would work in our favor.

2630
01:53:57,070 --> 01:53:59,970
We would not have to prepare for the Elimination Battle.

2631
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:01,809
We were confident that we were going to win.

2632
01:54:01,810 --> 01:54:04,679
Views actually don't mean anything.

2633
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:07,149
It's how many likes to views.

2634
01:54:07,150 --> 01:54:08,780
I don't want to go just yet.

2635
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:12,579
Which crew will come up to the fight zone?

2636
01:54:12,580 --> 01:54:15,050
Tokyo versus Osaka. What do you think?

2637
01:54:15,250 --> 01:54:17,659
Look at Rie Hata. She's down.

2638
01:54:17,660 --> 01:54:18,819
(What will be the result of the asepa match...)

2639
01:54:18,820 --> 01:54:20,236
(that'll determine the fate of RHTokyo?)

2640
01:54:20,260 --> 01:54:21,360
That's hard.

2641
01:54:22,630 --> 01:54:26,129
RHTokyo has placed first so far.

2642
01:54:26,130 --> 01:54:28,200
There are so many things left to do.

2643
01:54:28,700 --> 01:54:31,370
I hoped that we'd beat them in terms of likes.

2644
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:34,370
AG SQUAD versus ROYAL FAMILY.

2645
01:54:34,610 --> 01:54:36,839
ROYAL FAMILY versus AG SQUAD.

2646
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:37,939
Let's go.

2647
01:54:37,940 --> 01:54:40,680
What will be the fate of the two crews?

2648
01:54:41,050 --> 01:54:43,149
Having high views on our video,

2649
01:54:43,150 --> 01:54:46,650
we hoped that we'd get a higher global public voting score.

2650
01:54:46,780 --> 01:54:50,989
Seeing MOTIV beat OSAKA Ojo Gang regardless of the count of views...

2651
01:54:50,990 --> 01:54:53,219
gave us a possibility to win.

2652
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:56,459
The two crews' scores for the Global Public Evaluation...

2653
01:54:56,460 --> 01:54:58,530
will be revealed at the same time.

2654
01:54:59,130 --> 01:55:00,330
At the same time?

2655
01:55:01,170 --> 01:55:02,229
No way.

2656
01:55:02,230 --> 01:55:03,676
They'll be revealed at the same time.

2657
01:55:03,700 --> 01:55:05,339
This is incredible.

2658
01:55:05,340 --> 01:55:06,470
The two crews' scores...

2659
01:55:06,740 --> 01:55:07,870
I can't watch.

2660
01:55:08,370 --> 01:55:10,440
Please, Lord, be on our side today.

2661
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:12,710
The Global Public Evaluation...

2662
01:55:13,340 --> 01:55:15,250
I'm sure ROYAL FAMILY will win.

2663
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:17,119
We had a lot of comments.

2664
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:20,220
I assumed we had a lot of likes.

2665
01:55:20,550 --> 01:55:22,420
We're not going to lose today.

2666
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:23,660
Will be revealed...

2667
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:25,419
I can't keep still.

2668
01:55:25,420 --> 01:55:26,560
I'm not looking.

2669
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:28,990
Hurry up and give us the result.

2670
01:55:29,060 --> 01:55:30,130
Right now.

2671
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:34,629
(My goodness)

2672
01:55:34,630 --> 01:55:35,630
(Is this for real?)

2673
01:55:35,631 --> 01:55:38,569
(What will be...)

2674
01:55:38,570 --> 01:55:40,870
(the two crews' final scores?)

2675
01:55:41,570 --> 01:55:44,780
The two crews' scores for the Global Public Evaluation...

2676
01:55:44,910 --> 01:55:46,880
will be revealed at the same time.

2677
01:55:47,510 --> 01:55:49,150
At the same time?

2678
01:55:49,480 --> 01:55:50,579
No way.

2679
01:55:50,580 --> 01:55:52,060
They'll be revealed at the same time.

2680
01:55:52,150 --> 01:55:53,179
They'll be revealed right now.

2681
01:55:53,180 --> 01:55:54,389
(What will be...)

2682
01:55:54,390 --> 01:55:55,689
(the result?)

2683
01:55:55,690 --> 01:55:57,889
(My goodness)

2684
01:55:57,890 --> 01:55:59,490
(Is this for real?)

2685
01:55:59,620 --> 01:56:01,989
(World of K-pop, aespa match)

2686
01:56:01,990 --> 01:56:03,430
(Which crew will win?)

2687
01:56:11,900 --> 01:56:13,469
(Did we really win?)

2688
01:56:13,470 --> 01:56:15,170
(The winning crew is AG SQUAD.)

2689
01:56:15,310 --> 01:56:17,410
Oh my goodness. We got 900?

2690
01:56:17,510 --> 01:56:20,039
I could cry right now.

2691
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:21,449
Oh, my goodness.

2692
01:56:21,450 --> 01:56:22,450
(Crying)

2693
01:56:22,451 --> 01:56:23,950
Crazy! Yes!

2694
01:56:24,050 --> 01:56:25,050
(We...)

2695
01:56:25,420 --> 01:56:26,480
(did it!)

2696
01:56:27,820 --> 01:56:29,489
(Meanwhile, )

2697
01:56:29,490 --> 01:56:31,359
(ROYAL FAMILY is depressed.)

2698
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:32,490
We lost?

2699
01:56:33,060 --> 01:56:35,830
(ROYAL FAMILY lost in a match and became an elimination candidate.)

2700
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:38,399
I was so relieved.

2701
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:39,730
I was happy.

2702
01:56:39,860 --> 01:56:42,500
(With the score of 1,185 points, RHTokyo survives.)

2703
01:56:42,530 --> 01:56:45,140
She's crying. Oh, no.

2704
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:46,740
You're crying.

2705
01:56:47,270 --> 01:56:48,409
(She bursts into tears as tension leaves her body.)

2706
01:56:48,410 --> 01:56:52,679
For the Global Public Evaluation, Team Australia, AG SQUAD...

2707
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:56,609
received 120,516 likes...

2708
01:56:56,610 --> 01:57:00,150
and a score of 900 points.

2709
01:57:00,450 --> 01:57:01,550
Thank you.

2710
01:57:02,490 --> 01:57:04,890
AG SQUAD's total score...

2711
01:57:05,020 --> 01:57:07,390
is 1,241 points.

2712
01:57:07,660 --> 01:57:10,060
In the World of K-pop Mission,

2713
01:57:10,460 --> 01:57:13,099
they received the highest score.

2714
01:57:13,100 --> 01:57:14,329
(Did we?)

2715
01:57:14,330 --> 01:57:16,270
They ranked first.

2716
01:57:16,570 --> 01:57:18,300
(Startled)

2717
01:57:18,470 --> 01:57:19,699
(Congratulations!)

2718
01:57:19,700 --> 01:57:21,569
We agree.

2719
01:57:21,570 --> 01:57:23,410
AG SQUAD's video was really nice.

2720
01:57:23,610 --> 01:57:26,839
This is our hard work right here, so...

2721
01:57:26,840 --> 01:57:29,810
I truly believe that we do deserve this win.

2722
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:32,719
I'm just so emotional because I'm so proud of these girls.

2723
01:57:32,720 --> 01:57:33,720
And I'm just... Yes.

2724
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:34,920
Thank you.

2725
01:57:34,921 --> 01:57:36,089
(Invested)

2726
01:57:36,090 --> 01:57:39,919
I think, just for me... I've been behind the scenes a lot.

2727
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:44,229
So to come back and do myself and my team proud...

2728
01:57:44,230 --> 01:57:46,360
(Emotional)

2729
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:47,500
Kyra!

2730
01:57:48,030 --> 01:57:49,130
I love you!

2731
01:57:49,700 --> 01:57:50,940
I'm really happy today.

2732
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:54,139
(Kaea and Kyra share many emotions through a hug.)

2733
01:57:54,140 --> 01:57:55,270
You did well.

2734
01:57:55,340 --> 01:57:56,810
She got it. She always got it.

2735
01:57:57,810 --> 01:58:00,479
We've been losing a lot.

2736
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:02,879
We've lost everything, every challenge we've done.

2737
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:06,319
I lost my leader's challenge. I lost my battle.

2738
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:07,549
(ROYAL FAMILY took their choreography...)

2739
01:58:07,550 --> 01:58:08,590
(in the middle class.)

2740
01:58:08,820 --> 01:58:10,789
(AG SQUAD was on the edge of the cliff...)

2741
01:58:10,790 --> 01:58:12,719
(after getting named as the worst dancer.)

2742
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:14,829
Winning for the first time...

2743
01:58:14,830 --> 01:58:16,489
We're finally getting recognized...

2744
01:58:16,490 --> 01:58:19,629
that we are one of the best in this competition.

2745
01:58:19,630 --> 01:58:22,730
AG SQUAD was number one out of all the crews.

2746
01:58:23,330 --> 01:58:25,839
We got the highest scores, so we came first today,

2747
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:26,840
which is great.

2748
01:58:28,110 --> 01:58:30,940
Team New Zealand, ROYAL FAMILY crew,

2749
01:58:31,340 --> 01:58:32,940
in the global public evaluation...

2750
01:58:33,040 --> 01:58:37,220
received 92,887 likes...

2751
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:41,320
and received 700 points for the global public evaluation score.

2752
01:58:41,420 --> 01:58:44,590
ROYAL FAMILY had many views,

2753
01:58:44,690 --> 01:58:48,290
but received a low score on the likes.

2754
01:58:48,390 --> 01:58:50,800
ROYAL FAMILY, who lost the battle,

2755
01:58:50,900 --> 01:58:53,430
please prepare for the Elimination Battle.

2756
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:54,529
Angry.

2757
01:58:54,530 --> 01:58:56,469
We weren't expecting that at all.

2758
01:58:56,470 --> 01:58:58,340
It was a big shock to us.

2759
01:58:59,100 --> 01:59:01,170
World of Street Woman Fighter.

2760
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:05,839
The results of the World of K-pop mission are all out.

2761
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:06,840
(Final results)

2762
01:59:06,841 --> 01:59:09,650
(Elimination Battle)

2763
01:59:09,750 --> 01:59:13,350
The crews to face the first elimination battle are...

2764
01:59:13,850 --> 01:59:14,919
(OSAKA Ojo Gang versus ROYAL FAMILY)

2765
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:18,390
OSAKA Ojo Gang and ROYAL FAMILY.

2766
01:59:18,860 --> 01:59:20,060
- OSAKA and ROYAL. - Wait.

2767
01:59:20,460 --> 01:59:21,889
We're ready.

2768
01:59:21,890 --> 01:59:24,430
We want to start right away.

2769
01:59:24,830 --> 01:59:27,899
(Let's go, Kyoka.)

2770
01:59:27,900 --> 01:59:30,899
I want Kyoka to go crazy. I want her to go crazy.

2771
01:59:30,900 --> 01:59:33,670
She'd better go crazy.

2772
01:59:33,970 --> 01:59:36,969
We're ready to eat for real. Period.

2773
01:59:36,970 --> 01:59:38,139
We'll give you a show.

2774
01:59:38,140 --> 01:59:39,710
Dance or die.

2775
01:59:39,810 --> 01:59:42,180
From this moment on, please prepare for the battle...

2776
01:59:42,280 --> 01:59:44,680
with a do-or-die determination.

2777
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:47,920
(Elimination candidates: OSAKA Ojo Gang versus ROYAL FAMILY)

2778
01:59:53,020 --> 01:59:54,659
We ate the last battle.

2779
01:59:54,660 --> 01:59:56,689
So I feel like we're actually the strongest.

2780
01:59:56,690 --> 01:59:58,730
They know that we are the strongest.

2781
01:59:58,860 --> 01:59:59,899
Forfeit for real.

2782
01:59:59,900 --> 02:00:02,099
When it gets to this battle, just be cocky.

2783
02:00:02,100 --> 02:00:03,130
(Okay)

2784
02:00:03,300 --> 02:00:05,270
I think the energy will intimidate them.

2785
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:07,710
The girls can kill this all too.

2786
02:00:08,940 --> 02:00:11,579
We're strong and we deserve to stay.

2787
02:00:11,580 --> 02:00:14,679
Let's go with the spirit of getting three consecutive wins.

2788
02:00:14,680 --> 02:00:15,680
- Okay. - Okay.

2789
02:00:15,681 --> 02:00:17,950
Ibuki, Kyoka, Minami.

2790
02:00:18,050 --> 02:00:21,149
They're the top in the battle scene.

2791
02:00:21,150 --> 02:00:24,860
We have the best crew members, so we will definitely win.

2792
02:00:25,060 --> 02:00:26,360
- Let's kill this. - Yes.

2793
02:00:26,990 --> 02:00:28,059
Let's enjoy.

2794
02:00:28,060 --> 02:00:29,829
- Let's end it easily. - Easily.

2795
02:00:29,830 --> 02:00:30,860
That's so cool.

2796
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:32,130
Go.

2797
02:00:32,230 --> 02:00:33,699
(We won't be eliminated.)

2798
02:00:33,700 --> 02:00:35,329
(A world-class battler?)

2799
02:00:35,330 --> 02:00:36,330
(What on earth?)

2800
02:00:36,331 --> 02:00:38,040
(This isn't right.)

2801
02:00:38,340 --> 02:00:39,970
(Take it!)

2802
02:00:40,070 --> 02:00:42,110
(You can't dance like that.)

2803
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:45,410
(The first crew to be eliminated is finally announced.)

2804
02:00:45,510 --> 02:00:47,609
(We really might get eliminated.)

2805
02:00:47,610 --> 02:00:49,279
(I didn't want to go home.)

2806
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:51,779
(Hello, World of Street Woman Fighter dancers.)

2807
02:00:51,780 --> 02:00:53,579
(It's Jennie here.)

2808
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:55,019
(And I've got a special mission for you.)

2809
02:00:55,020 --> 02:00:57,790
The first crew to be eliminated will be revealed soon,

2810
02:00:57,890 --> 02:01:00,020
and the global public voting will begin.

2811
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:03,159
A global dance battle where the fiercest women...

2812
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:04,676
from around the world put their pride on the line.

2813
02:01:04,700 --> 02:01:07,970
I'm Sung Han Bin, the MC of World of Street Woman Fighter.

2814
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,740
Let's go!

2815
02:01:11,470 --> 02:01:13,440
Today, we'll have an elimination battle...

2816
02:01:13,540 --> 02:01:17,979
that decides the first crew to be eliminated.

2817
02:01:17,980 --> 02:01:19,380
Oh, my gosh!

2818
02:01:19,510 --> 02:01:21,010
I'm just so nervous.

2819
02:01:21,110 --> 02:01:24,980
Before the elimination battle, I'll introduce the fight judges...

2820
02:01:25,080 --> 02:01:27,489
who will judge the battle.

2821
02:01:27,490 --> 02:01:28,550
(Redy)

2822
02:01:28,820 --> 02:01:30,389
Who is it?

2823
02:01:30,390 --> 02:01:32,219
I'm very interested to see who it is.

2824
02:01:32,220 --> 02:01:33,860
The pride of street dance.

2825
02:01:34,260 --> 02:01:36,390
The peak performer of hip-hop.

2826
02:01:36,890 --> 02:01:39,330
Mike Song.

2827
02:01:39,730 --> 02:01:41,670
Mike Song!

2828
02:01:42,070 --> 02:01:43,300
(I'm here.)

2829
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:45,800
Dance!

2830
02:01:46,540 --> 02:01:48,310
Let's go!

2831
02:01:49,410 --> 02:01:51,410
(Burn it up)

2832
02:01:57,750 --> 02:01:58,750
(Show us more!)

2833
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:01,890
(That's Mike Song.)

2834
02:02:06,120 --> 02:02:08,730
(The oppa class)

2835
02:02:09,930 --> 02:02:11,730
(He did it.)

2836
02:02:13,400 --> 02:02:14,400
(Practicing the ending fairy move.)

2837
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:15,400
The fall.

2838
02:02:15,401 --> 02:02:18,199
Next up is a dancer who completes the K-pop stage...

2839
02:02:18,200 --> 02:02:20,710
with sharp directing and intricate choreography...

2840
02:02:20,810 --> 02:02:23,040
- Who is it? - behind the scenes.

2841
02:02:23,510 --> 02:02:26,879
Back Koo Young!

2842
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:29,150
(The father of K-pop?)

2843
02:02:29,910 --> 02:02:31,320
What?

2844
02:02:31,480 --> 02:02:33,350
- He's famous. - So famous.

2845
02:02:34,420 --> 02:02:35,820
Let's go!

2846
02:02:37,090 --> 02:02:38,219
So handsome!

2847
02:02:38,220 --> 02:02:39,920
(He's cool!)

2848
02:02:42,590 --> 02:02:45,400
(It's thrilling.)

2849
02:02:46,830 --> 02:02:48,600
That's crazy.

2850
02:02:48,930 --> 02:02:50,530
That one move is nice.

2851
02:02:50,770 --> 02:02:52,730
This judge redefined the Japanese street scene...

2852
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:54,709
with precise technique and deep emotion.

2853
02:02:54,710 --> 02:02:55,870
A Japanese?

2854
02:02:56,110 --> 02:02:57,710
A master of movement.

2855
02:02:58,180 --> 02:02:59,240
Who is it?

2856
02:03:00,310 --> 02:03:02,679
Kazukiyo!

2857
02:03:02,680 --> 02:03:03,880
(Judge Kazukiyo)

2858
02:03:05,420 --> 02:03:06,549
Kazukiyo?

2859
02:03:06,550 --> 02:03:08,020
He's really famous.

2860
02:03:10,150 --> 02:03:12,490
(He blends house and hip-hop styles.)

2861
02:03:13,460 --> 02:03:15,089
(A dancer who expresses music itself...)

2862
02:03:15,090 --> 02:03:17,730
(with a unique style and groove.)

2863
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,330
They called great judges.

2864
02:03:19,660 --> 02:03:22,570
(His hip DNA wakes up.)

2865
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:25,639
(This is fun!)

2866
02:03:25,640 --> 02:03:26,640
House!

2867
02:03:28,110 --> 02:03:29,340
(Dazzling moves)

2868
02:03:29,670 --> 02:03:30,780
Okay!

2869
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:32,909
- I like that. - Fire.

2870
02:03:32,910 --> 02:03:34,010
Yes.

2871
02:03:35,710 --> 02:03:36,879
(Polite)

2872
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:37,880
(Bowing in return)

2873
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:39,120
(Kazukiyo)

2874
02:03:39,320 --> 02:03:41,490
The next fight judge...

2875
02:03:42,190 --> 02:03:44,289
is the icon representing the first generation...

2876
02:03:44,290 --> 02:03:45,760
of the Korean street scene...

2877
02:03:46,220 --> 02:03:49,490
and a hip-hop battler who captivated the world.

2878
02:03:50,230 --> 02:03:51,999
BABYSLEEK!

2879
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:53,830
(Amazing!)

2880
02:03:56,130 --> 02:03:59,270
- We love Wolf'Lo! - Let's go Team Orange!

2881
02:03:59,640 --> 02:04:02,840
(Fight judge BABYSLEEK)

2882
02:04:03,510 --> 02:04:07,280
(The oldest member in Wolf'Lo, the hip-hop crew)

2883
02:04:07,750 --> 02:04:10,049
(A living legend of the Korean street dance, )

2884
02:04:10,050 --> 02:04:12,290
(with countless battle victories and judging experience)

2885
02:04:12,420 --> 02:04:15,550
(An authentic hip-hop dancer, BABYSLEEK)

2886
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:18,420
- So cool. - Hip-hop.

2887
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:20,560
(She's so cool.)

2888
02:04:22,030 --> 02:04:23,660
(Welcome)

2889
02:04:25,230 --> 02:04:26,560
(Cheering)

2890
02:04:31,340 --> 02:04:33,900
(She's going crazy!)

2891
02:04:35,570 --> 02:04:37,410
(They're moving together.)

2892
02:04:37,510 --> 02:04:39,540
(Thank you.)

2893
02:04:39,780 --> 02:04:41,109
(Total respect)

2894
02:04:41,110 --> 02:04:43,110
The last fight judge...

2895
02:04:43,680 --> 02:04:45,950
is the dance captain approved by Beyonce.

2896
02:04:46,750 --> 02:04:47,750
Beyonce?

2897
02:04:47,850 --> 02:04:51,090
The performance leader who led Beyonce's stages.

2898
02:04:51,290 --> 02:04:52,290
What?

2899
02:04:52,291 --> 02:04:54,530
Ashley Everett!

2900
02:04:57,060 --> 02:04:58,399
Ashley!

2901
02:04:58,400 --> 02:05:02,299
Oh, my gosh! Really? No way!

2902
02:05:02,300 --> 02:05:04,170
- Oh, my gosh. - What?

2903
02:05:04,770 --> 02:05:05,800
Let's go!

2904
02:05:08,210 --> 02:05:09,939
(Standing up)

2905
02:05:09,940 --> 02:05:10,979
I'm a huge fan.

2906
02:05:10,980 --> 02:05:12,580
I got goosebumps.

2907
02:05:13,140 --> 02:05:14,950
I got goosebumps!

2908
02:05:15,050 --> 02:05:16,850
She's the reason why I dyed my hair red.

2909
02:05:16,950 --> 02:05:18,320
The reason why I kept it.

2910
02:05:19,350 --> 02:05:21,819
- Beyonce's main dancer. - Ashley!

2911
02:05:21,820 --> 02:05:24,589
(Major songs she participated in: "Single Ladies")

2912
02:05:24,590 --> 02:05:28,289
("Run The World")

2913
02:05:28,290 --> 02:05:29,290
Awesome!

2914
02:05:32,100 --> 02:05:33,359
Hello, Queen!

2915
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:34,430
Icon.

2916
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:36,630
(Scream)

2917
02:05:39,570 --> 02:05:41,640
(They all can't get over the shock.)

2918
02:05:42,710 --> 02:05:44,440
(It's nice to meet you all.)

2919
02:05:44,810 --> 02:05:46,139
(Fainting)

2920
02:05:46,140 --> 02:05:48,479
Period!

2921
02:05:48,480 --> 02:05:49,809
Yes!

2922
02:05:49,810 --> 02:05:52,050
(The 5 fight judges are seated.)

2923
02:05:52,950 --> 02:05:53,950
That's awesome.

2924
02:05:53,951 --> 02:05:55,519
They're really going international.

2925
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:57,989
- This is amazing. - This is a new combination.

2926
02:05:57,990 --> 02:05:59,890
- This is fun. - It's so fun.

2927
02:06:00,090 --> 02:06:01,530
The battles would be fun to watch.

2928
02:06:01,730 --> 02:06:05,400
The first crew to perform in the elimination battle...

2929
02:06:06,030 --> 02:06:07,530
is Team Japan...

2930
02:06:09,830 --> 02:06:11,900
OSAKA Ojo Gang.

2931
02:06:12,640 --> 02:06:15,670
("Gang's Spirit Queen's Move," OSAKA Ojo Gang's cheering theme)

2932
02:06:15,810 --> 02:06:18,610
(Ojo Gang is here.)

2933
02:06:18,710 --> 02:06:23,209
(They're excited.)

2934
02:06:23,210 --> 02:06:24,379
Let's go!

2935
02:06:24,380 --> 02:06:27,750
- Let's go! - Ojo Gang!

2936
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:30,960
Don't go! Win!

2937
02:06:31,060 --> 02:06:32,259
Let's go, Ojo Gang!

2938
02:06:32,260 --> 02:06:34,560
It's not yet time to go home. You can't go!

2939
02:06:35,260 --> 02:06:37,759
Let's go, Kyoka!

2940
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:39,500
Kyoka is already in battle mode.

2941
02:06:40,160 --> 02:06:41,229
They're ready.

2942
02:06:41,230 --> 02:06:42,830
The second elimination candidate crew...

2943
02:06:42,900 --> 02:06:47,170
who will battle against OSAKA Ojo Gang...

2944
02:06:47,270 --> 02:06:51,240
is Team New Zealand, ROYAL FAMILY.

2945
02:06:51,640 --> 02:06:55,879
(ROYAL FAMILY enters.)

2946
02:06:55,880 --> 02:06:57,979
("Crown's up" ROYAL FAMILY's cheering theme)

2947
02:06:57,980 --> 02:06:59,050
Let's go!

2948
02:07:05,290 --> 02:07:06,720
Teesha, you got it!

2949
02:07:07,790 --> 02:07:09,090
I hope they do well.

2950
02:07:10,530 --> 02:07:14,059
You can be the main dancer but also do the elimination battle.

2951
02:07:14,060 --> 02:07:15,146
You never know what's going to happen.

2952
02:07:15,170 --> 02:07:17,529
Ojo Gang versus ROYAL FAMILY.

2953
02:07:17,530 --> 02:07:20,300
This is crazy.

2954
02:07:20,700 --> 02:07:22,640
It's about to be a battle.

2955
02:07:23,170 --> 02:07:25,879
- They're nervous. - Seriously.

2956
02:07:25,880 --> 02:07:27,039
(They're nervous as well.)

2957
02:07:27,040 --> 02:07:28,480
Before the battle begins,

2958
02:07:28,580 --> 02:07:31,980
I'll explain how the Elimination Battle will proceed.

2959
02:07:32,380 --> 02:07:35,720
The first crew to win 3 out of 5 rounds will win,

2960
02:07:36,050 --> 02:07:38,760
and the first round, which opens the Elimination Battle,

2961
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:40,320
will be a team battle.

2962
02:07:40,860 --> 02:07:44,500
Each crew’s ace dancer will battle against each other in Round Two.

2963
02:07:45,660 --> 02:07:46,959
Kyoka would be there.

2964
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:49,169
It would be Kyoka or Ibuki.

2965
02:07:49,170 --> 02:07:50,500
Minami was really good too.

2966
02:07:50,670 --> 02:07:53,339
Teesha's nice. Harmz is nice too.

2967
02:07:53,340 --> 02:07:54,770
They'll definitely be confident.

2968
02:07:55,470 --> 02:07:59,140
The following Rounds 3 and 4 will be relay team battles.

2969
02:07:59,410 --> 02:08:03,479
The relay team battle...

2970
02:08:03,480 --> 02:08:05,040
consists of three consecutive segments.

2971
02:08:05,320 --> 02:08:07,680
The first segment is a duet battle.

2972
02:08:07,790 --> 02:08:11,590
The 2nd and 3rd segments are simultaneous 1-on-1 battles.

2973
02:08:12,260 --> 02:08:13,360
It's 2-on-2,

2974
02:08:13,460 --> 02:08:14,830
- Then the next. - then 1-on-1.

2975
02:08:15,160 --> 02:08:18,630
The final fifth round is the leader battle...

2976
02:08:19,100 --> 02:08:21,730
where the crew’s pride is on the line.

2977
02:08:22,230 --> 02:08:24,399
(Exclaiming)

2978
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:25,570
Leader battle it is.

2979
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:27,440
I say Ibuki wins.

2980
02:08:28,070 --> 02:08:30,410
Teesha is going to bring out the fire in her.

2981
02:08:30,510 --> 02:08:31,980
They are both going to do well.

2982
02:08:32,510 --> 02:08:34,809
The 1st crew to win 3 battles...

2983
02:08:34,810 --> 02:08:36,349
secures their spot in the competition.

2984
02:08:36,350 --> 02:08:37,586
But the losing crew will have to...

2985
02:08:37,610 --> 02:08:40,719
leave as the very first to be eliminated,

2986
02:08:40,720 --> 02:08:42,490
bearing the shame of defeat.

2987
02:08:43,390 --> 02:08:44,959
That's so mean.

2988
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:45,960
This is war.

2989
02:08:46,620 --> 02:08:50,230
"Let's win three times and end this battle."

2990
02:08:50,530 --> 02:08:52,559
To make it through and not go home,

2991
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:54,030
we have to win the battle.

2992
02:08:54,160 --> 02:08:56,229
In this fierce battle for survival,

2993
02:08:56,230 --> 02:09:00,939
which crew will first taste the bitter sting of elimination?

2994
02:09:00,940 --> 02:09:02,640
So nervous.

2995
02:09:02,740 --> 02:09:05,839
You're watching World of Street Woman Fighter.

2996
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:08,750
And we will begin the first Elimination Battle.

2997
02:09:09,750 --> 02:09:11,009
Only beginning.

2998
02:09:11,010 --> 02:09:12,449
(Ready)

2999
02:09:12,450 --> 02:09:13,450
Let's do this.

3000
02:09:13,750 --> 02:09:14,750
Let's go.

3001
02:09:15,550 --> 02:09:17,420
Don't look nervous. We're confident.

3002
02:09:17,820 --> 02:09:19,589
Let's have fun, no matter what.

3003
02:09:19,590 --> 02:09:20,819
Let's crush it.

3004
02:09:20,820 --> 02:09:22,100
That's the most important thing.

3005
02:09:22,760 --> 02:09:23,860
Go, girls!

3006
02:09:24,530 --> 02:09:25,900
Let's go!

3007
02:09:26,160 --> 02:09:28,800
The first Elimination Battle. It's crazy.

3008
02:09:29,070 --> 02:09:32,570
We'll decide who goes first by spinning the bottle.

3009
02:09:32,870 --> 02:09:34,270
Like seen on street dance.

3010
02:09:37,140 --> 02:09:38,940
ROYAL FAMILY will make the first move.

3011
02:09:39,580 --> 02:09:41,710
OSAKA Ojo Gang will go second.

3012
02:09:42,010 --> 02:09:43,149
Better to go first.

3013
02:09:43,150 --> 02:09:45,419
- Yes. Less pressure. - Less pressure.

3014
02:09:45,420 --> 02:09:47,850
Ojo, Ojo, Ojo Gang!

3015
02:09:48,320 --> 02:09:49,919
(Go, girls!)

3016
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:51,559
Ojo Gang!

3017
02:09:51,560 --> 02:09:53,319
ROYAL FAMILY!

3018
02:09:53,320 --> 02:09:55,029
(Let's beat!)

3019
02:09:55,030 --> 02:09:56,929
Let's go, ROYAL FAMILY!

3020
02:09:56,930 --> 02:09:59,499
The group battle between the two crews...

3021
02:09:59,500 --> 02:10:01,576
with the first elimination of World of Street Woman Fighter...

3022
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:04,000
begins now.

3023
02:10:04,030 --> 02:10:05,200
(Redy, Capri, Vessi)

3024
02:10:05,900 --> 02:10:07,400
Go, fight!

3025
02:10:07,770 --> 02:10:09,240
Let's go!

3026
02:10:09,440 --> 02:10:10,669
We will win today.

3027
02:10:10,670 --> 02:10:12,410
Getting eliminated is not an option.

3028
02:10:12,610 --> 02:10:14,480
I don't think we deserve to go home.

3029
02:10:14,950 --> 02:10:15,980
You guys ready?

3030
02:10:17,010 --> 02:10:18,019
Fight!

3031
02:10:18,020 --> 02:10:21,590
(Round 1, ROYAL FAMILY takes the 1st strike)

3032
02:10:24,760 --> 02:10:26,890
I can predict their moves.

3033
02:10:28,930 --> 02:10:29,930
(Swinging)

3034
02:10:29,930 --> 02:10:30,930
(Let's go!)

3035
02:10:30,930 --> 02:10:31,930
(Focused)

3036
02:10:35,400 --> 02:10:36,470
We're going to kill it.

3037
02:10:37,470 --> 02:10:38,900
(Focused)

3038
02:10:44,310 --> 02:10:45,909
(Powerful)

3039
02:10:45,910 --> 02:10:47,009
(Thrilled)

3040
02:10:47,010 --> 02:10:48,080
(Shocked)

3041
02:10:56,720 --> 02:10:58,990
It was just like what I expected.

3042
02:11:00,020 --> 02:11:01,490
(ROYAL FAMILY performs using props.)

3043
02:11:03,160 --> 02:11:04,260
I'm dead!

3044
02:11:06,130 --> 02:11:07,999
We'll show them how strong we are.

3045
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,600
Using props? They must be desperate.

3046
02:11:14,200 --> 02:11:15,210
(Eyes widening)

3047
02:11:17,170 --> 02:11:18,180
(Enjoying)

3048
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:20,880
They hit that stage up.

3049
02:11:21,450 --> 02:11:22,950
It was too performance-like.

3050
02:11:26,380 --> 02:11:27,920
(Jumping attack)

3051
02:11:33,860 --> 02:11:36,789
They were so aggressive that I couldn't see their moves.

3052
02:11:36,790 --> 02:11:41,599
In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

3053
02:11:41,600 --> 02:11:43,570
Switch. OSAKA Ojo Gang.

3054
02:11:45,540 --> 02:11:46,799
(Ojo Gang Kill)

3055
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:48,770
I think we definitely proved it.

3056
02:11:49,340 --> 02:11:50,769
(They tore it!)

3057
02:11:50,770 --> 02:11:51,779
Change.

3058
02:11:51,780 --> 02:11:52,780
(Blown away)

3059
02:11:52,781 --> 02:11:56,310
(Round 1, and OSAKA Ojo Gang goes 2nd.)

3060
02:11:56,550 --> 02:11:59,380
They were touching us. They seemed to lack confidence.

3061
02:12:00,550 --> 02:12:03,290
The energy on stage was just amazing.

3062
02:12:05,420 --> 02:12:06,790
(Battle mode on)

3063
02:12:07,260 --> 02:12:10,660
It’s time for Ojo Gang to take this stage back.

3064
02:12:10,960 --> 02:12:14,159
(We're all in!)

3065
02:12:14,160 --> 02:12:15,899
Let's show them what we got.

3066
02:12:15,900 --> 02:12:17,400
No, it wasn't threatening.

3067
02:12:21,470 --> 02:12:22,470
(Exclaiming)

3068
02:12:24,510 --> 02:12:25,510
(That's it!)

3069
02:12:27,740 --> 02:12:29,449
I danced with power.

3070
02:12:29,450 --> 02:12:30,880
Quite annoyed us.

3071
02:12:31,350 --> 02:12:33,150
Hana!

3072
02:12:34,350 --> 02:12:35,450
Amazing, Kyoka.

3073
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:38,360
(Hana, Ibuki, and Ruu take off their jackets.)

3074
02:12:38,490 --> 02:12:39,590
Let's go!

3075
02:12:40,290 --> 02:12:41,359
They took off their jackets.

3076
02:12:41,360 --> 02:12:43,959
(It’s waacking time!)

3077
02:12:43,960 --> 02:12:44,960
(Surprised)

3078
02:12:44,960 --> 02:12:45,960
So cool!

3079
02:12:46,100 --> 02:12:48,330
We loaded it with real technique.

3080
02:12:48,470 --> 02:12:49,470
I don't mind.

3081
02:13:01,950 --> 02:13:04,280
I let Minami take control.

3082
02:13:05,550 --> 02:13:06,879
(Look at that)

3083
02:13:06,880 --> 02:13:08,320
(That was genius!)

3084
02:13:09,120 --> 02:13:10,419
They made our job easier.

3085
02:13:10,420 --> 02:13:11,420
Go!

3086
02:13:11,720 --> 02:13:13,319
Let's go!

3087
02:13:13,320 --> 02:13:15,459
(Ibuki's windmill)

3088
02:13:15,460 --> 02:13:16,560
(Amazing)

3089
02:13:18,900 --> 02:13:24,130
In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

3090
02:13:25,670 --> 02:13:26,670
(No way!)

3091
02:13:26,671 --> 02:13:28,870
Battle...

3092
02:13:29,770 --> 02:13:31,269
We don't need the crown. Bye-bye.

3093
02:13:31,270 --> 02:13:34,780
I wasn't angry. I was like, "Oh, wow".

3094
02:13:34,850 --> 02:13:37,150
(She threw the crown and stepped on it!)

3095
02:13:37,950 --> 02:13:40,150
(Judges are shocked.)

3096
02:13:41,320 --> 02:13:43,789
Battle over.

3097
02:13:43,790 --> 02:13:45,790
(Elimination Battle Round 1, the team battle ends)

3098
02:13:47,690 --> 02:13:49,260
No way.

3099
02:13:49,630 --> 02:13:52,229
(Scream!)

3100
02:13:52,230 --> 02:13:54,800
(The crown's gone now.)

3101
02:13:55,930 --> 02:13:58,070
I thought, "It's over".

3102
02:13:58,200 --> 02:13:59,439
(Goodbye, ROYAL FAMILY.)

3103
02:13:59,440 --> 02:14:02,339
They took the crown and slashed it.

3104
02:14:02,340 --> 02:14:03,340
(They loved it.)

3105
02:14:03,440 --> 02:14:05,880
That was good. Oh, my gosh.

3106
02:14:06,410 --> 02:14:09,110
- Did you see that? - I did. She took it off.

3107
02:14:09,410 --> 02:14:10,779
That was insane.

3108
02:14:10,780 --> 02:14:12,919
I don't really like what she did with the crown.

3109
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:14,319
I'm getting offended.

3110
02:14:14,320 --> 02:14:16,290
The energy’s with Ojo Gang now.

3111
02:14:18,460 --> 02:14:21,930
I'm so happy with our performance.

3112
02:14:23,560 --> 02:14:25,030
It's hard to choose.

3113
02:14:25,400 --> 02:14:26,400
It's hard to choose.

3114
02:14:27,300 --> 02:14:28,529
But that was so good.

3115
02:14:28,530 --> 02:14:31,330
They were in their faces.

3116
02:14:32,100 --> 02:14:33,569
They ate that.

3117
02:14:33,570 --> 02:14:35,469
Since it's a team battle,

3118
02:14:35,470 --> 02:14:37,909
it was even more exciting to see...

3119
02:14:37,910 --> 02:14:40,509
how each member poured all their energy and personality...

3120
02:14:40,510 --> 02:14:41,750
into that short moment.

3121
02:14:41,810 --> 02:14:44,820
I know that we were coming in with more hunger and passion.

3122
02:14:45,020 --> 02:14:47,250
Honestly, I thought we won.

3123
02:14:49,020 --> 02:14:50,689
(Groaning)

3124
02:14:50,690 --> 02:14:52,460
This is so hard.

3125
02:14:53,720 --> 02:14:55,690
I know that feeling.

3126
02:14:56,130 --> 02:14:58,800
This is world champion versus world champion.

3127
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,570
We have the world champion choreography team...

3128
02:15:02,130 --> 02:15:04,269
versus world champion battlers.

3129
02:15:04,270 --> 02:15:05,769
This is totally...

3130
02:15:05,770 --> 02:15:08,209
This would... This usually never happens. Ever.

3131
02:15:08,210 --> 02:15:10,439
- Right? - It's only on this stage.

3132
02:15:10,440 --> 02:15:11,839
- You're right. - You guys right now...

3133
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:13,079
So lucky!

3134
02:15:13,080 --> 02:15:15,010
So lucky to see this.

3135
02:15:15,650 --> 02:15:16,650
Seriously.

3136
02:15:16,880 --> 02:15:18,010
He's right.

3137
02:15:18,150 --> 02:15:20,079
He's totally right.

3138
02:15:20,080 --> 02:15:23,219
ROYAL FAMILY was all about...

3139
02:15:23,220 --> 02:15:26,419
energy, vibe, and ideas.

3140
02:15:26,420 --> 02:15:29,659
They were using props,

3141
02:15:29,660 --> 02:15:32,029
and they were all-in for the entertainment,

3142
02:15:32,030 --> 02:15:33,830
which made it very fun to watch.

3143
02:15:35,430 --> 02:15:38,239
Ojo Gang. I can tell you guys...

3144
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:41,610
do this. The battling. I can tell you do it.

3145
02:15:41,770 --> 02:15:44,669
You came with the energy and the points.

3146
02:15:44,670 --> 02:15:46,939
And making memorable moments.

3147
02:15:46,940 --> 02:15:49,209
So I definitely credit you for that.

3148
02:15:49,210 --> 02:15:50,310
That was a great battle.

3149
02:15:50,810 --> 02:15:52,120
Both teams are amazing.

3150
02:15:54,620 --> 02:15:58,419
Now, let's find out the result of the battle.

3151
02:15:58,420 --> 02:15:59,719
(Tensed up)

3152
02:15:59,720 --> 02:16:01,259
That was a super hard battle.

3153
02:16:01,260 --> 02:16:03,066
(Which crew is going to win the Round 1 team battle?)

3154
02:16:03,090 --> 02:16:05,359
I do believe ROYAL FAMILY won that one.

3155
02:16:05,360 --> 02:16:06,959
I say Ojo Gang.

3156
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:08,899
We were going to win the crew battle.

3157
02:16:08,900 --> 02:16:12,399
With the desire to win, we all came together as one.

3158
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:13,869
Fight judges.

3159
02:16:13,870 --> 02:16:16,409
(Who would the fight judges choose?)

3160
02:16:16,410 --> 02:16:17,410
Open...

3161
02:16:17,610 --> 02:16:18,840
Surely pink.

3162
02:16:19,180 --> 02:16:20,710
I knew we were going to win.

3163
02:16:21,040 --> 02:16:22,050
The cards.

3164
02:16:22,280 --> 02:16:25,050
(Who is it?)

3165
02:16:34,590 --> 02:16:37,089
(OSAKA Ojo Gang is the winner of Round 1 Team Battle.)

3166
02:16:37,090 --> 02:16:40,329
(No way!)

3167
02:16:40,330 --> 02:16:42,569
(Surprised)

3168
02:16:42,570 --> 02:16:45,399
(What?)

3169
02:16:45,400 --> 02:16:47,470
(Crazy!)

3170
02:16:48,410 --> 02:16:52,639
In just 40 seconds, we showed multiple highlights.

3171
02:16:52,640 --> 02:16:54,979
That strategy seemed to have worked.

3172
02:16:54,980 --> 02:16:56,379
Honestly, I was thrilled.

3173
02:16:56,380 --> 02:16:58,009
(Giggling)

3174
02:16:58,010 --> 02:17:00,819
(Soaking in the joy)

3175
02:17:00,820 --> 02:17:03,720
(Disappointed)

3176
02:17:04,150 --> 02:17:08,630
It’s more about the foundations than the creativity behind it.

3177
02:17:10,330 --> 02:17:11,860
It's a lot of pressure.

3178
02:17:11,960 --> 02:17:13,460
Next is Round Two,

3179
02:17:13,730 --> 02:17:15,470
Ace Battle.

3180
02:17:17,330 --> 02:17:18,340
Ace?

3181
02:17:18,570 --> 02:17:19,570
Ace Battle?

3182
02:17:19,940 --> 02:17:21,040
- Ace? - Ace.

3183
02:17:21,470 --> 02:17:22,570
Who is it going to be?

3184
02:17:23,010 --> 02:17:25,809
The Ace Battle is a 1-on-1 match...

3185
02:17:25,810 --> 02:17:28,179
between the strongest members...

3186
02:17:28,180 --> 02:17:29,979
representing each crew.

3187
02:17:29,980 --> 02:17:32,079
(Excited)

3188
02:17:32,080 --> 02:17:33,080
Who is it going to be?

3189
02:17:33,081 --> 02:17:34,380
Kyoka, surely, right?

3190
02:17:35,090 --> 02:17:38,720
Who's the ace dancer of OSAKA Ojo Gang?

3191
02:17:39,220 --> 02:17:41,830
Of course, it's going to be...

3192
02:17:42,430 --> 02:17:43,930
Kyoka.

3193
02:17:44,530 --> 02:17:46,859
(Kyoka is the ace dancer of OSAKA Ojo Gang for Round 2.)

3194
02:17:46,860 --> 02:17:49,170
Kyoka!

3195
02:17:50,600 --> 02:17:51,600
Yes, Kyoka!

3196
02:17:51,601 --> 02:17:54,069
(It's Kyoka!)

3197
02:17:54,070 --> 02:17:55,409
Everyone had faith in me...

3198
02:17:55,410 --> 02:17:58,979
and picked me for the ace battle.

3199
02:17:58,980 --> 02:18:01,340
So I decided to step up with their faith on my shoulders.

3200
02:18:02,010 --> 02:18:03,010
(Anyone!)

3201
02:18:03,610 --> 02:18:05,379
I was expecting Kyoka.

3202
02:18:05,380 --> 02:18:07,149
They are going to choose Kyoka.

3203
02:18:07,150 --> 02:18:09,919
Especially whoever we choose to be the ace...

3204
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:12,660
I think she is capable of winning.

3205
02:18:13,020 --> 02:18:15,530
You're ace. We trust you. That's why..

3206
02:18:15,930 --> 02:18:17,090
You got this.

3207
02:18:17,830 --> 02:18:21,000
Who's the ace dancer of ROYAL FAMILY?

3208
02:18:21,560 --> 02:18:22,570
Who is it going to be?

3209
02:18:22,970 --> 02:18:24,030
Teesha?

3210
02:18:24,300 --> 02:18:25,869
Maybe they will give it to Isla?

3211
02:18:25,870 --> 02:18:28,039
So our ace dancer is...

3212
02:18:28,040 --> 02:18:30,910
(ROYAL FAMILY's ace dancer is...)

3213
02:18:31,440 --> 02:18:32,679
Moana.

3214
02:18:32,680 --> 02:18:34,409
(Moana is the ace dancer of ROYAL FAMILY for Round 2.)

3215
02:18:34,410 --> 02:18:36,050
Yes, girl!

3216
02:18:36,580 --> 02:18:39,080
Yes! Moana against Kyoka.

3217
02:18:39,350 --> 02:18:40,979
She's going to be flowy, and she's going to be crazy.

3218
02:18:40,980 --> 02:18:42,150
She's going to kill it.

3219
02:18:42,850 --> 02:18:45,389
(During 1 on 1 battle during No Respect World Battle)

3220
02:18:45,390 --> 02:18:46,759
(Thrilled)

3221
02:18:46,760 --> 02:18:49,860
Moana, your power and speed is amazing.

3222
02:18:50,290 --> 02:18:54,859
I feel like it is very clear that you're a very versatile mover.

3223
02:18:54,860 --> 02:18:56,370
I believe in Moana.

3224
02:18:56,770 --> 02:18:58,330
It's a chance to show 100 percent.

3225
02:18:58,470 --> 02:18:59,770
Show them the real you.

3226
02:19:00,170 --> 02:19:02,939
Moana was like, "This is my last chance."

3227
02:19:02,940 --> 02:19:05,979
"I'm going to take back the win for our team."

3228
02:19:05,980 --> 02:19:07,239
The girls believed in me.

3229
02:19:07,240 --> 02:19:08,850
I'm willing to try my best.

3230
02:19:10,510 --> 02:19:11,880
I wasn't worried at all.

3231
02:19:13,350 --> 02:19:16,649
The ace battle begins now.

3232
02:19:16,650 --> 02:19:18,959
Let's go, Kyoka!

3233
02:19:18,960 --> 02:19:21,890
- Go, Moana! - Go, Moana!

3234
02:19:22,060 --> 02:19:23,559
(Ace)

3235
02:19:23,560 --> 02:19:25,100
(Let's go!)

3236
02:19:25,160 --> 02:19:26,530
You guys ready?

3237
02:19:26,560 --> 02:19:30,000
Of course I am not going to lose.

3238
02:19:30,100 --> 02:19:31,329
Take your time.

3239
02:19:31,330 --> 02:19:33,140
Okay. Prove it with your battle, then.

3240
02:19:33,370 --> 02:19:34,470
Fight!

3241
02:19:34,740 --> 02:19:36,169
(Moana of ROYAL FAMILY goes 1st on Round 2.)

3242
02:19:36,170 --> 02:19:37,410
I will show you.

3243
02:19:39,410 --> 02:19:40,440
Prove it.

3244
02:19:45,780 --> 02:19:46,920
Go, Moana!

3245
02:19:48,380 --> 02:19:49,389
(Exclaiming)

3246
02:19:49,390 --> 02:19:50,790
It was something unexpected.

3247
02:19:56,190 --> 02:19:57,390
(Powerful)

3248
02:19:57,760 --> 02:19:59,530
They gave her a hip-hop track.

3249
02:20:04,430 --> 02:20:06,470
That's it, Moana!

3250
02:20:07,500 --> 02:20:08,770
Be confident.

3251
02:20:10,210 --> 02:20:12,010
It turned on my battle switch.

3252
02:20:13,940 --> 02:20:15,380
It is insane.

3253
02:20:22,090 --> 02:20:23,389
(Getting pulled in)

3254
02:20:23,390 --> 02:20:24,490
Is that all?

3255
02:20:29,590 --> 02:20:30,790
(Focused)

3256
02:20:33,330 --> 02:20:34,400
Go hard.

3257
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,470
Her moves were so unclear.

3258
02:20:43,570 --> 02:20:48,279
Time to switch. In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

3259
02:20:48,280 --> 02:20:49,480
Switch.

3260
02:20:49,980 --> 02:20:51,209
I pulled out everything.

3261
02:20:51,210 --> 02:20:53,019
Kyoka is up next.

3262
02:20:53,020 --> 02:20:54,860
(Kyoka of OSAKA Ojo Gang goes 2nd on Round 2.)

3263
02:20:56,790 --> 02:20:57,890
Show me.

3264
02:20:59,560 --> 02:21:01,160
I'll hit back with full power.

3265
02:21:06,030 --> 02:21:07,060
Insane.

3266
02:21:09,330 --> 02:21:10,430
Yes, Kyoka!

3267
02:21:11,330 --> 02:21:12,500
That is crazy.

3268
02:21:17,710 --> 02:21:18,780
Love it.

3269
02:21:19,840 --> 02:21:20,840
Okay.

3270
02:21:24,610 --> 02:21:25,620
(Blown away)

3271
02:21:29,350 --> 02:21:31,790
I think Ojo Gang took over.

3272
02:21:31,960 --> 02:21:33,060
I'm not sure.

3273
02:21:36,930 --> 02:21:38,630
Kyoka!

3274
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:48,709
Ending in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

3275
02:21:48,710 --> 02:21:50,769
Battle over.

3276
02:21:50,770 --> 02:21:52,840
(Elimination Battle Round 2, Ace Battle ends.)

3277
02:21:53,140 --> 02:21:54,840
(Amazed)

3278
02:21:59,120 --> 02:22:00,120
All good.

3279
02:22:00,320 --> 02:22:01,350
You ate that.

3280
02:22:01,720 --> 02:22:03,520
I won 100 percent.

3281
02:22:05,190 --> 02:22:08,460
She did crazy with the energy, but Kyoka owned the floor.

3282
02:22:09,030 --> 02:22:11,489
So depends on what they want.

3283
02:22:11,490 --> 02:22:13,359
Fight Judge Back Koo Young.

3284
02:22:13,360 --> 02:22:15,399
What did you think of the battle?

3285
02:22:15,400 --> 02:22:17,769
I got chills watching it.

3286
02:22:17,770 --> 02:22:20,499
When Moana began,

3287
02:22:20,500 --> 02:22:23,140
I was overwhelmed by her energy.

3288
02:22:23,240 --> 02:22:25,009
I got sucked in.

3289
02:22:25,010 --> 02:22:26,240
She was incredible.

3290
02:22:26,780 --> 02:22:28,909
Kyoka, when you first came out,

3291
02:22:28,910 --> 02:22:32,379
already, you were reading different rhythms out the gate.

3292
02:22:32,380 --> 02:22:35,690
It just shows your musicality.

3293
02:22:35,920 --> 02:22:39,560
The spontaneity of the moment, of being able to make those choices.

3294
02:22:39,690 --> 02:22:41,160
It was super raw.

3295
02:22:43,490 --> 02:22:46,759
Kyoka completely owned that stage...

3296
02:22:46,760 --> 02:22:47,900
and won.

3297
02:22:48,160 --> 02:22:50,299
She's confident.

3298
02:22:50,300 --> 02:22:51,999
That makes you want to watch her.

3299
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,769
It's insane. This one is a hard one.

3300
02:22:54,770 --> 02:22:56,240
Let's find out the result...

3301
02:22:56,870 --> 02:22:57,970
of the battle.

3302
02:22:58,880 --> 02:23:00,709
I thought I would win 5 to 0.

3303
02:23:00,710 --> 02:23:02,509
I had the confidence to win.

3304
02:23:02,510 --> 02:23:05,579
I think I tried my best, pulling out everything...

3305
02:23:05,580 --> 02:23:06,780
that we would win.

3306
02:23:06,850 --> 02:23:07,850
Fight Judges.

3307
02:23:09,350 --> 02:23:11,150
Card open.

3308
02:23:11,490 --> 02:23:12,660
(Curious)

3309
02:23:18,590 --> 02:23:20,959
(Kyoka of OSAKA Ojo Gang wins the ace battle of Round 2.)

3310
02:23:20,960 --> 02:23:23,430
(Sad)

3311
02:23:23,970 --> 02:23:27,000
(We won!)

3312
02:23:28,170 --> 02:23:31,709
Considering my position, I had to win no matter what.

3313
02:23:31,710 --> 02:23:33,310
So I was super happy.

3314
02:23:34,410 --> 02:23:35,780
Can we huddle?

3315
02:23:36,910 --> 02:23:38,510
I was very emotional.

3316
02:23:41,220 --> 02:23:42,989
Tears came from anger.

3317
02:23:42,990 --> 02:23:44,589
I thought I should've won.

3318
02:23:44,590 --> 02:23:49,090
I didn't want to finish this trip just to end on a bad note.

3319
02:23:51,030 --> 02:23:53,929
Lock in, girl. You might get to jump in again.

3320
02:23:53,930 --> 02:23:56,299
- Okay? - Moana, you ate that.

3321
02:23:56,300 --> 02:23:57,970
Show them what you got to them again.

3322
02:23:58,330 --> 02:23:59,899
I think we just need energy,

3323
02:23:59,900 --> 02:24:02,940
and I think they can sense that. You were nervous.

3324
02:24:03,570 --> 02:24:05,380
Let's keep the energy up.

3325
02:24:06,010 --> 02:24:08,080
Let's keep it going.

3326
02:24:08,440 --> 02:24:09,520
Let's keep this flow going.

3327
02:24:10,080 --> 02:24:12,949
Round Three, which might be the last round,

3328
02:24:12,950 --> 02:24:14,720
is Relay Team Battle.

3329
02:24:14,950 --> 02:24:18,020
If OSAKA Ojo Gang wins yet again,

3330
02:24:18,350 --> 02:24:21,859
ROYAL FAMILY who didn't win once...

3331
02:24:21,860 --> 02:24:24,529
will become the first-ever crew to be eliminated on the show...

3332
02:24:24,530 --> 02:24:26,059
and leave the stage.

3333
02:24:26,060 --> 02:24:27,229
I was scared.

3334
02:24:27,230 --> 02:24:29,629
We were one battle away from just being eliminated.

3335
02:24:29,630 --> 02:24:31,600
I didn't want to go home.

3336
02:24:31,700 --> 02:24:34,440
You still got three chances. You got time to catch up.

3337
02:24:34,900 --> 02:24:38,910
Now, let’s decide who will go 1st in the 1st match.

3338
02:24:39,610 --> 02:24:42,210
- Please spin it well. - It better point the other side.

3339
02:24:42,250 --> 02:24:43,509
That bottle hates us.

3340
02:24:43,510 --> 02:24:44,980
We always go first.

3341
02:24:45,050 --> 02:24:46,449
(Please)

3342
02:24:46,450 --> 02:24:48,350
- I think we will go first. - It's about time.

3343
02:24:48,550 --> 02:24:49,789
To be honest, it doesn't matter.

3344
02:24:49,790 --> 02:24:51,519
(Which crew will go 1st in Round 3?)

3345
02:24:51,520 --> 02:24:52,859
It's nerve-racking.

3346
02:24:52,860 --> 02:24:54,459
I was very desperate.

3347
02:24:54,460 --> 02:24:55,929
I wasn't anxious.

3348
02:24:55,930 --> 02:24:57,790
I was ready to accept whatever might come.

3349
02:24:58,690 --> 02:25:01,960
(OSAKA Ojo Gang will go 1st on Round 3.)

3350
02:25:02,200 --> 02:25:03,370
Yes!

3351
02:25:03,630 --> 02:25:04,630
(I knew it.)

3352
02:25:05,770 --> 02:25:06,939
Just for the first match.

3353
02:25:06,940 --> 02:25:08,469
- Just 2 on 2. - Yes, just 2 on 2.

3354
02:25:08,470 --> 02:25:09,569
That's good.

3355
02:25:09,570 --> 02:25:11,370
I like that we can listen to the song.

3356
02:25:11,540 --> 02:25:14,110
Now we got time to decide who can go.

3357
02:25:14,340 --> 02:25:15,609
It's the first thing going our way.

3358
02:25:15,610 --> 02:25:17,679
I hope that gives them a little confidence.

3359
02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:18,920
Right. Yes.

3360
02:25:19,180 --> 02:25:21,379
Let's give it everything, girls. It's our last time.

3361
02:25:21,380 --> 02:25:22,689
It's the last time they are going to see us.

3362
02:25:22,690 --> 02:25:24,249
So let's pour out everything and go.

3363
02:25:24,250 --> 02:25:25,819
(We got this.)

3364
02:25:25,820 --> 02:25:28,789
To win, we need to practice.

3365
02:25:28,790 --> 02:25:29,959
Right. Let's stay calm.

3366
02:25:29,960 --> 02:25:31,489
Okay. No need to be anxious.

3367
02:25:31,490 --> 02:25:32,630
Okay.

3368
02:25:33,060 --> 02:25:35,970
Now, the Relay Team Battle begins.

3369
02:25:36,570 --> 02:25:37,599
Let's go!

3370
02:25:37,600 --> 02:25:38,600
(Expectations go up!)

3371
02:25:38,601 --> 02:25:39,670
Let's go!

3372
02:25:40,800 --> 02:25:42,040
Drop the beat!

3373
02:25:43,010 --> 02:25:44,816
(Round 3, Relay Team Battle, 1st 2:2 match starts!)

3374
02:25:44,840 --> 02:25:46,610
It's hip-hop.

3375
02:25:46,840 --> 02:25:48,780
It's hip-hop. Who is it going to be?

3376
02:25:48,950 --> 02:25:50,550
It has to be this one.

3377
02:25:51,010 --> 02:25:52,050
Popping?

3378
02:25:52,520 --> 02:25:54,320
It's too slow.

3379
02:25:55,490 --> 02:25:56,519
It's very slow.

3380
02:25:56,520 --> 02:25:59,520
The song was a bit too slow, so we had to think.

3381
02:26:01,360 --> 02:26:03,030
Isn't it Junna?

3382
02:26:03,390 --> 02:26:05,089
Kyoka and Minami should do it.

3383
02:26:05,090 --> 02:26:07,630
Maybe they thought they're going to save Kyoka for last?

3384
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:09,070
Do you want to go?

3385
02:26:09,630 --> 02:26:11,599
- Should we go? - Let's go.

3386
02:26:11,600 --> 02:26:13,000
There they come.

3387
02:26:13,140 --> 02:26:14,670
No, I don't care.

3388
02:26:15,240 --> 02:26:16,639
Okay. Watch us.

3389
02:26:16,640 --> 02:26:17,709
Let's go!

3390
02:26:17,710 --> 02:26:19,209
(Let's go!)

3391
02:26:19,210 --> 02:26:23,710
I did expect for Ojo Gang to use Kyoka and Minami.

3392
02:26:24,110 --> 02:26:27,019
We were going first, so we had to pick up a fight.

3393
02:26:27,020 --> 02:26:28,850
Let us show you.

3394
02:26:31,020 --> 02:26:33,260
We were determined to win.

3395
02:26:33,890 --> 02:26:35,560
Let's enjoy it for now.

3396
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:38,060
Yes!

3397
02:26:38,530 --> 02:26:40,000
They are good.

3398
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:43,029
(Totally in sync)

3399
02:26:43,030 --> 02:26:44,369
So tasty!

3400
02:26:44,370 --> 02:26:45,370
(1 more Kyonami's fan)

3401
02:26:47,740 --> 02:26:51,210
They really proved Ojo Gang's presence.

3402
02:26:51,770 --> 02:26:52,840
Let's go!

3403
02:26:54,740 --> 02:26:55,779
(Crowd goes...)

3404
02:26:55,780 --> 02:26:57,010
(wild!)

3405
02:26:57,080 --> 02:26:58,150
(Oh, my gosh!)

3406
02:27:03,220 --> 02:27:05,740
It's such a well-built routine. They made it so easy to groove.

3407
02:27:07,260 --> 02:27:08,289
(Insane!)

3408
02:27:08,290 --> 02:27:09,560
That was a smart choice.

3409
02:27:09,860 --> 02:27:11,290
(I approve.)

3410
02:27:12,800 --> 02:27:16,099
Ojo Gang totally owned it.

3411
02:27:16,100 --> 02:27:17,100
Let's go!

3412
02:27:17,101 --> 02:27:18,169
(You are...)

3413
02:27:18,170 --> 02:27:19,170
(no match for us.)

3414
02:27:19,171 --> 02:27:21,069
Don't play with us. Really.

3415
02:27:21,070 --> 02:27:23,970
All I had was the confidence that I was going to win.

3416
02:27:24,940 --> 02:27:26,210
So we were going to keep at it.

3417
02:27:27,880 --> 02:27:31,379
It's 5, 4, 3...

3418
02:27:31,380 --> 02:27:32,679
(Time for...)

3419
02:27:32,680 --> 02:27:34,019
(the final blow!)

3420
02:27:34,020 --> 02:27:36,090
It's 2, 1.

3421
02:27:38,720 --> 02:27:40,020
(They slayed!)

3422
02:27:43,030 --> 02:27:45,629
It's 3, 2, 1.

3423
02:27:45,630 --> 02:27:46,659
(What was that?)

3424
02:27:46,660 --> 02:27:48,530
Honestly, we won.

3425
02:27:49,470 --> 02:27:51,000
Their shoes are clean.

3426
02:27:53,300 --> 02:27:54,499
(Bring it on.)

3427
02:27:54,500 --> 02:27:56,510
Let's go.

3428
02:27:57,510 --> 02:27:59,510
Who's going to be the duo? Is it the two?

3429
02:28:01,880 --> 02:28:03,049
(Isla and Teesha step up!)

3430
02:28:03,050 --> 02:28:05,050
- Let's go, girls! - You got this!

3431
02:28:05,650 --> 02:28:07,820
We have to win not to go home.

3432
02:28:08,620 --> 02:28:10,720
(That's it!)

3433
02:28:12,660 --> 02:28:14,590
They constantly repeated the same moves.

3434
02:28:17,160 --> 02:28:18,459
(Legendary!)

3435
02:28:18,460 --> 02:28:20,699
They didn't seem to want to win.

3436
02:28:20,700 --> 02:28:22,500
Are they just comfortable with us?

3437
02:28:23,930 --> 02:28:27,469
Don't let us fool you.

3438
02:28:27,470 --> 02:28:29,440
Because we will beat.

3439
02:28:30,210 --> 02:28:31,240
(Shocked)

3440
02:28:31,770 --> 02:28:33,509
Polyswagg!

3441
02:28:33,510 --> 02:28:35,040
Okay!

3442
02:28:39,020 --> 02:28:40,850
I never back down from anything.

3443
02:28:42,050 --> 02:28:43,090
I laughed so hard.

3444
02:28:43,520 --> 02:28:46,320
Go now!

3445
02:28:46,520 --> 02:28:50,190
Whoever is in the front, everyone is ready to fight together.

3446
02:28:51,830 --> 02:28:53,199
(Nice...)

3447
02:28:53,200 --> 02:28:54,659
(flow!)

3448
02:28:54,660 --> 02:28:55,830
(Well done!)

3449
02:28:56,270 --> 02:28:58,199
- Go! - What's this?

3450
02:28:58,200 --> 02:29:01,240
Watch out, you all. The winner is the Royal Family.

3451
02:29:02,910 --> 02:29:04,369
They weren't threatening at all.

3452
02:29:04,370 --> 02:29:06,740
You still got 20 seconds. Keep going.

3453
02:29:07,110 --> 02:29:08,110
Go, Isla!

3454
02:29:08,111 --> 02:29:09,349
We are still strong.

3455
02:29:09,350 --> 02:29:11,080
I can beat them for ROYAL FAMILY.

3456
02:29:13,350 --> 02:29:15,720
Stop on 5, 4...

3457
02:29:15,920 --> 02:29:17,249
(Everyone!)

3458
02:29:17,250 --> 02:29:19,459
In 3, 2, 1.

3459
02:29:19,460 --> 02:29:21,020
Section switch!

3460
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:22,660
They did well at the end.

3461
02:29:25,630 --> 02:29:27,930
(Section 2, section switch)

3462
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:29,969
- Let's decide first. - Yes. We will.

3463
02:29:29,970 --> 02:29:32,640
(ROYAL FAMILY listens to the music too.)

3464
02:29:34,970 --> 02:29:37,670
(They begin.)

3465
02:29:37,840 --> 02:29:39,740
Who is it? Who is going?

3466
02:29:41,040 --> 02:29:42,040
Go!

3467
02:29:42,080 --> 02:29:43,256
(Ibuki of OSAKA Ojo Gang goes.)

3468
02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:45,250
(Standing up)

3469
02:29:47,250 --> 02:29:49,989
I was determined to end the battle.

3470
02:29:49,990 --> 02:29:51,250
This could be our last chance.

3471
02:29:51,420 --> 02:29:54,620
I was ready to beat someone if I got the chance to.

3472
02:29:55,560 --> 02:29:57,259
Harmz is scary!

3473
02:29:57,260 --> 02:29:59,500
- Wait! - Come on!

3474
02:30:00,200 --> 02:30:01,729
I tried to stay calm...

3475
02:30:01,730 --> 02:30:03,500
and show my moves clearly.

3476
02:30:03,700 --> 02:30:04,700
Go!

3477
02:30:05,370 --> 02:30:07,640
I incorporated lots of skills into the routine as well.

3478
02:30:11,110 --> 02:30:12,680
(Let's get up!)

3479
02:30:16,780 --> 02:30:19,450
I am going to take back the win for our team.

3480
02:30:19,550 --> 02:30:21,850
I never lose in freestyle.

3481
02:30:25,350 --> 02:30:28,020
(Thrilled)

3482
02:30:31,690 --> 02:30:32,800
This is my time.

3483
02:30:34,830 --> 02:30:36,470
Focus. Just pull it.

3484
02:30:38,900 --> 02:30:40,940
Go get it!

3485
02:30:47,310 --> 02:30:48,379
(My goodness.)

3486
02:30:48,380 --> 02:30:50,279
We are not on the same level.

3487
02:30:50,280 --> 02:30:53,049
I am the battle scene legend.

3488
02:30:53,050 --> 02:30:54,520
I am going to beat you.

3489
02:30:54,620 --> 02:30:56,390
I can beat you easily.

3490
02:30:56,890 --> 02:30:58,789
Last section switch!

3491
02:30:58,790 --> 02:31:00,520
I love it. They are neck and neck.

3492
02:31:03,190 --> 02:31:05,530
Oh, my gosh.

3493
02:31:05,930 --> 02:31:07,159
(Round 3 Relay Team Battle, Simultaneous 1-on-1 Battle)

3494
02:31:07,160 --> 02:31:08,900
- Get it! - Let's go, Minami!

3495
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:10,700
(We can't lose.)

3496
02:31:10,800 --> 02:31:11,800
(Go, Zari!)

3497
02:31:11,870 --> 02:31:13,069
Whoever goes first wins.

3498
02:31:13,070 --> 02:31:14,170
Go!

3499
02:31:14,740 --> 02:31:16,509
(Minami versus Zari)

3500
02:31:16,510 --> 02:31:19,239
I wanted to do well and make the team proud.

3501
02:31:19,240 --> 02:31:21,740
Don't hold anything back. Leave everything on the floor.

3502
02:31:22,550 --> 02:31:24,210
(Thrilled)

3503
02:31:24,310 --> 02:31:25,820
(Shocked)

3504
02:31:28,720 --> 02:31:30,350
She seems to lack something.

3505
02:31:33,920 --> 02:31:35,419
(Thrilled)

3506
02:31:35,420 --> 02:31:37,530
(Exclaiming)

3507
02:31:38,330 --> 02:31:40,629
To keep us in the battle and to prove that...

3508
02:31:40,630 --> 02:31:41,999
we deserve to stay,

3509
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:45,400
I'm going to give it my all so I have no regrets.

3510
02:31:48,770 --> 02:31:50,339
You are amazing!

3511
02:31:50,340 --> 02:31:51,940
(Thrilled)

3512
02:31:55,040 --> 02:31:56,549
(We can't lose. I'm going to wave the slogan flag!)

3513
02:31:56,550 --> 02:31:59,919
I just wanted to make it Ojo Gang’s stage right away.

3514
02:31:59,920 --> 02:32:01,419
Go, Minami!

3515
02:32:01,420 --> 02:32:03,120
Show them!

3516
02:32:05,750 --> 02:32:06,960
I finished them.

3517
02:32:07,260 --> 02:32:08,290
Go, Minami!

3518
02:32:09,060 --> 02:32:11,630
Go grab it! Take that off her hand!

3519
02:32:12,190 --> 02:32:14,830
(Trying to snatch the flag)

3520
02:32:15,530 --> 02:32:17,230
What's happening?

3521
02:32:17,800 --> 02:32:19,199
(Shocked)

3522
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:20,270
Give it back!

3523
02:32:23,640 --> 02:32:25,110
You are desperate to win.

3524
02:32:25,210 --> 02:32:27,680
We played with everything out there on the floor.

3525
02:32:29,680 --> 02:32:31,610
Battle over!

3526
02:32:32,110 --> 02:32:33,779
(She ate it!)

3527
02:32:33,780 --> 02:32:35,449
(Impressed)

3528
02:32:35,450 --> 02:32:37,389
(Clapping)

3529
02:32:37,390 --> 02:32:38,720
Nice!

3530
02:32:41,390 --> 02:32:42,460
You ate that!

3531
02:32:44,960 --> 02:32:48,199
- It was a real fight. - A real fight, it was.

3532
02:32:48,200 --> 02:32:49,630
Fight Judge Kazukiyo.

3533
02:32:49,730 --> 02:32:51,330
What did you think of the battle?

3534
02:32:51,430 --> 02:32:55,069
Kyoka and Minami kicked it off...

3535
02:32:55,070 --> 02:32:58,309
and totally took control of the music and vibe.

3536
02:32:58,310 --> 02:33:01,879
I could feel ROYAL FAMILY going in as a unit, not just individually.

3537
02:33:01,880 --> 02:33:03,449
The way they hyped up the atmosphere...

3538
02:33:03,450 --> 02:33:05,810
I have to say, I was impressed.

3539
02:33:05,920 --> 02:33:08,879
I feel like for me, my favorite moment of this battle,

3540
02:33:08,880 --> 02:33:10,490
this entire thing was...

3541
02:33:10,590 --> 02:33:13,460
I loved the exchange between Zari and Minami.

3542
02:33:13,760 --> 02:33:15,619
Minami, when you went up,

3543
02:33:15,620 --> 02:33:17,229
you didn't just step over.

3544
02:33:17,230 --> 02:33:19,630
But the choice to turn that into a groove...

3545
02:33:20,530 --> 02:33:24,300
was... That is just...

3546
02:33:25,300 --> 02:33:28,470
But then Zari, taking that and be like, "Hold up".

3547
02:33:28,740 --> 02:33:30,239
"Let's take the whole space in..."

3548
02:33:30,240 --> 02:33:32,880
"and take it to a whole another level".

3549
02:33:33,280 --> 02:33:35,179
This is that top-level stuff.

3550
02:33:35,180 --> 02:33:36,280
Really great work, you all.

3551
02:33:36,380 --> 02:33:38,549
- That was great. - Great stuff.

3552
02:33:38,550 --> 02:33:39,649
(Thank you.)

3553
02:33:39,650 --> 02:33:42,920
Please. Let's finish it. Please.

3554
02:33:43,020 --> 02:33:46,090
Let's find out the result of the battle.

3555
02:33:46,460 --> 02:33:48,559
We tried our best.

3556
02:33:48,560 --> 02:33:50,960
If that's the last thing we do on the stage, we ate that up.

3557
02:33:51,060 --> 02:33:52,060
- I know. - Period.

3558
02:33:52,390 --> 02:33:55,530
First, let's check the result...

3559
02:33:55,630 --> 02:33:57,930
of Mike Song and Kazukiyo.

3560
02:33:58,400 --> 02:34:00,140
Card open.

3561
02:34:02,040 --> 02:34:03,439
(No way)

3562
02:34:03,440 --> 02:34:05,210
(Please.)

3563
02:34:05,240 --> 02:34:07,910
It's 1 on 1.

3564
02:34:08,240 --> 02:34:09,380
That's our first vote.

3565
02:34:10,210 --> 02:34:12,180
That's our first vote of the night.

3566
02:34:13,180 --> 02:34:15,580
We had a little bit of hope that we wouldn't lose.

3567
02:34:16,020 --> 02:34:18,550
What would be the three Fight Judges' choice?

3568
02:34:18,650 --> 02:34:22,320
Come on. Green.

3569
02:34:22,660 --> 02:34:24,330
Keep going. Keep pushing.

3570
02:34:24,560 --> 02:34:26,460
Card open.

3571
02:34:28,700 --> 02:34:30,129
(OSAKA Ojo Gang: 1, ROYAL FAMILY: 4)

3572
02:34:30,130 --> 02:34:31,969
(Overwhelmed)

3573
02:34:31,970 --> 02:34:33,599
(Feeling sorry)

3574
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:35,499
(ROYAL FAMILY wins Round 3.)

3575
02:34:35,500 --> 02:34:36,509
(Well done, Queens.)

3576
02:34:36,510 --> 02:34:37,709
(Hugging tightly)

3577
02:34:37,710 --> 02:34:40,409
(ROYAL FAMILY captured the last chance.)

3578
02:34:40,410 --> 02:34:42,380
(Overjoyed)

3579
02:34:43,980 --> 02:34:45,849
I was happy with the results.

3580
02:34:45,850 --> 02:34:50,190
I was just focused on going forward, another round.

3581
02:34:50,720 --> 02:34:53,520
The current score is 2 on 1.

3582
02:34:54,290 --> 02:34:56,560
OSAKA Ojo Gang won twice.

3583
02:34:56,660 --> 02:34:59,930
If they win the round, their survival gets confirmed.

3584
02:35:00,860 --> 02:35:03,370
The elimination battle will end immediately.

3585
02:35:04,130 --> 02:35:08,900
I feel confident that ROYAL FAMILY won't be in the elimination.

3586
02:35:09,300 --> 02:35:11,040
- We got it. - Let's go.

3587
02:35:11,640 --> 02:35:14,409
Honestly, I think we already won.

3588
02:35:14,410 --> 02:35:16,410
We are full of confidence.

3589
02:35:16,510 --> 02:35:20,120
What destiny lies ahead for these two crews standing at a crossroads?

3590
02:35:21,020 --> 02:35:24,520
Moving forward, Round 4 will be the same as Round 3.

3591
02:35:24,620 --> 02:35:26,490
- Let's go! - Let's go!

3592
02:35:28,190 --> 02:35:29,959
ROYAL FAMILY will go first,

3593
02:35:29,960 --> 02:35:32,160
and OSAKA Ojo Gang will go second.

3594
02:35:32,700 --> 02:35:34,029
Let's go.

3595
02:35:34,030 --> 02:35:35,360
- Get ready. - Okay.

3596
02:35:35,500 --> 02:35:38,670
We can just wait and listen for as long as we need.

3597
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,269
If they get three, they win.

3598
02:35:41,270 --> 02:35:42,770
ROYAL FAMILY seems tenser.

3599
02:35:43,010 --> 02:35:44,310
Last one, guys.

3600
02:35:45,170 --> 02:35:46,679
We can do this.

3601
02:35:46,680 --> 02:35:48,309
- Do or die. - Do or die.

3602
02:35:48,310 --> 02:35:51,280
It makes me want to prove to everyone...

3603
02:35:51,380 --> 02:35:53,050
that we are the best.

3604
02:35:53,150 --> 02:35:54,820
Let's give it all.

3605
02:35:55,020 --> 02:35:56,519
- Let's do this. - Let's win this.

3606
02:35:56,520 --> 02:35:58,149
- Let's win this. Have fun too. - Yes.

3607
02:35:58,150 --> 02:35:59,536
Even if they come at us, we will hit back with everything we’ve got.

3608
02:35:59,560 --> 02:36:01,160
I thought we had to win.

3609
02:36:01,290 --> 02:36:03,530
- Ojo, Ojo, Ojo Gang! - Ojo, Ojo, Ojo Gang!

3610
02:36:04,090 --> 02:36:06,930
- One, two, three, ROYAL FAMILY! - ROYAL FAMILY!

3611
02:36:08,630 --> 02:36:10,699
- Let's go, girls. - Let's go!

3612
02:36:10,700 --> 02:36:14,399
Relay Team Battle will begin now.

3613
02:36:14,400 --> 02:36:16,109
Let's go!

3614
02:36:16,110 --> 02:36:17,839
- Drop the beat. - Come on, DJ.

3615
02:36:17,840 --> 02:36:19,246
(Round 4, 2 on 2 battle, ROYAL FAMILY goes 1st.)

3616
02:36:19,270 --> 02:36:20,339
We need to listen.

3617
02:36:20,340 --> 02:36:22,640
- Who is it going to be? - Two aces?

3618
02:36:22,910 --> 02:36:24,010
Bring it on.

3619
02:36:24,410 --> 02:36:25,750
We must win.

3620
02:36:26,250 --> 02:36:27,250
Let's go.

3621
02:36:27,380 --> 02:36:28,380
Tiare and Maiya.

3622
02:36:29,050 --> 02:36:30,849
We just believed in ourselves.

3623
02:36:30,850 --> 02:36:31,850
We can do it.

3624
02:36:32,520 --> 02:36:33,520
Let's go.

3625
02:36:33,690 --> 02:36:35,690
We will show you why we deserve to win.

3626
02:36:36,020 --> 02:36:37,760
Show them!

3627
02:36:43,830 --> 02:36:44,830
Again.

3628
02:36:46,030 --> 02:36:48,970
Okay.

3629
02:36:49,240 --> 02:36:50,440
Hey!

3630
02:36:53,140 --> 02:36:54,140
Push through!

3631
02:36:56,080 --> 02:36:58,710
They kept repeating the same moves.

3632
02:36:59,480 --> 02:37:02,219
ROYAL FAMILY often uses hip movements in their routines.

3633
02:37:02,220 --> 02:37:04,419
I can totally do this.

3634
02:37:04,420 --> 02:37:06,620
(Here we go.)

3635
02:37:11,030 --> 02:37:12,490
(Staring)

3636
02:37:12,590 --> 02:37:13,999
It doesn't matter now.

3637
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:18,270
(Provoking)

3638
02:37:20,540 --> 02:37:22,639
Period!

3639
02:37:22,640 --> 02:37:23,670
Airtight.

3640
02:37:24,270 --> 02:37:26,310
Stop in 5, 4...

3641
02:37:26,410 --> 02:37:28,840
In 3, 2, 1.

3642
02:37:29,480 --> 02:37:31,779
She ate it up.

3643
02:37:31,780 --> 02:37:33,550
Looks like we’ve got this again.

3644
02:37:34,020 --> 02:37:35,650
That was insane.

3645
02:37:35,750 --> 02:37:36,850
Here we go.

3646
02:37:37,090 --> 02:37:38,090
Switch.

3647
02:37:38,920 --> 02:37:42,659
I saw the two girls dance,

3648
02:37:42,660 --> 02:37:44,360
and there was quite a bit of hip action.

3649
02:37:44,690 --> 02:37:46,929
So we decided to go sexy.

3650
02:37:46,930 --> 02:37:50,329
(Junna and Uwa of OSAKA Ojo Gang go second.)

3651
02:37:50,330 --> 02:37:51,600
It's Junna and Uwa.

3652
02:37:51,700 --> 02:37:52,770
Junna's here.

3653
02:37:54,240 --> 02:37:55,770
We got this.

3654
02:38:00,240 --> 02:38:01,680
We showed them our hip action.

3655
02:38:02,280 --> 02:38:04,280
(All eyes on them)

3656
02:38:06,650 --> 02:38:07,680
Boring.

3657
02:38:19,190 --> 02:38:20,730
Keep watching us.

3658
02:38:36,750 --> 02:38:38,580
They were just comfortable with us.

3659
02:38:41,550 --> 02:38:43,920
Surely, we wouldn't lose.

3660
02:38:44,650 --> 02:38:45,650
- Let's go. - Countdown.

3661
02:38:45,651 --> 02:38:49,320
Five, four, three, two, one.

3662
02:38:49,560 --> 02:38:51,460
Section switch.

3663
02:38:51,660 --> 02:38:53,529
I had so much fun.

3664
02:38:53,530 --> 02:38:56,200
Honestly, I think we won.

3665
02:38:56,770 --> 02:38:58,230
(Section 2 switch)

3666
02:38:59,740 --> 02:39:01,639
- Who's it going to be? - Go, Teesh.

3667
02:39:01,640 --> 02:39:02,739
Isla or Teesha.

3668
02:39:02,740 --> 02:39:04,469
I'm ready to watch Ibuki battle.

3669
02:39:04,470 --> 02:39:06,310
I'm ready to watch Kyoka.

3670
02:39:06,610 --> 02:39:10,949
(Who's going to join 1-on-1 Simultaneous Battle?)

3671
02:39:10,950 --> 02:39:12,209
Yes. Come out.

3672
02:39:12,210 --> 02:39:13,949
(Surprised)

3673
02:39:13,950 --> 02:39:14,950
(Kyoka of OSAKA Ojo Gang comes forward.)

3674
02:39:14,950 --> 02:39:15,950
Kyoka, go.

3675
02:39:16,820 --> 02:39:18,189
The other team hesitated...

3676
02:39:18,190 --> 02:39:20,220
to come forward.

3677
02:39:20,590 --> 02:39:22,220
So I decided to go first.

3678
02:39:22,290 --> 02:39:26,159
I danced alone for the first five seconds.

3679
02:39:26,160 --> 02:39:28,199
(The judges stand up.)

3680
02:39:28,200 --> 02:39:30,199
Kyoka!

3681
02:39:30,200 --> 02:39:31,599
It was Kyoka.

3682
02:39:31,600 --> 02:39:33,800
She's hitting one with Kyoka. Oh, my gosh.

3683
02:39:34,570 --> 02:39:36,739
I'm sorry, but those five seconds...

3684
02:39:36,740 --> 02:39:37,970
were enough for me to win.

3685
02:39:38,170 --> 02:39:39,980
(Isla of ROYAL FAMILY)

3686
02:39:40,910 --> 02:39:42,240
Isla's up.

3687
02:39:42,740 --> 02:39:44,249
They know what they're good at.

3688
02:39:44,250 --> 02:39:45,510
I didn't really mind.

3689
02:39:46,520 --> 02:39:47,579
Let's go.

3690
02:39:47,580 --> 02:39:49,520
I am still feeling confident.

3691
02:39:52,920 --> 02:39:55,020
She was full of confidence.

3692
02:39:59,130 --> 02:40:01,430
No one could stop her.

3693
02:40:01,830 --> 02:40:03,830
Okay.

3694
02:40:04,930 --> 02:40:06,500
Nail her.

3695
02:40:10,610 --> 02:40:11,709
That's crazy.

3696
02:40:11,710 --> 02:40:12,940
Oh, Kyoka.

3697
02:40:16,140 --> 02:40:17,580
Kyoka lived up to her name.

3698
02:40:21,650 --> 02:40:22,750
Let's go.

3699
02:40:23,520 --> 02:40:24,650
Stop.

3700
02:40:25,990 --> 02:40:27,690
Isla killed it.

3701
02:40:27,790 --> 02:40:29,630
Isla.

3702
02:40:30,490 --> 02:40:33,130
The energy in the stage was just amazing.

3703
02:40:33,930 --> 02:40:35,560
I knew I won, obviously.

3704
02:40:36,500 --> 02:40:37,569
Go, Isla.

3705
02:40:37,570 --> 02:40:39,599
- Kyoka is such a hottie. - Countdown.

3706
02:40:39,600 --> 02:40:43,570
Five, four, three, two, one.

3707
02:40:43,770 --> 02:40:46,480
Last section, switch.

3708
02:40:46,740 --> 02:40:50,050
(Overwhelmed)

3709
02:40:50,850 --> 02:40:52,379
- They were good. - They had fun.

3710
02:40:52,380 --> 02:40:54,149
They know how to have fun.

3711
02:40:54,150 --> 02:40:56,080
Section, switch.

3712
02:40:56,350 --> 02:40:59,220
(The last section of the Relay Team Battle)

3713
02:40:59,420 --> 02:41:00,660
Who's going next?

3714
02:41:01,090 --> 02:41:03,960
Who is it?

3715
02:41:04,030 --> 02:41:06,029
Moana was brave enough to go again.

3716
02:41:06,030 --> 02:41:07,460
Come on. Kill it again.

3717
02:41:07,800 --> 02:41:10,770
It was enough time to redeem herself.

3718
02:41:11,100 --> 02:41:12,129
(You can do it, Moana.)

3719
02:41:12,130 --> 02:41:14,169
Moana again.

3720
02:41:14,170 --> 02:41:16,510
I just wanted to redeem myself.

3721
02:41:17,840 --> 02:41:18,840
Oh, no.

3722
02:41:19,310 --> 02:41:20,910
Oh, no.

3723
02:41:20,980 --> 02:41:22,140
I should've gone now.

3724
02:41:23,610 --> 02:41:25,450
I wanted to do the 1-on-1 Simultaneous Battle.

3725
02:41:25,510 --> 02:41:26,820
Ibuki?

3726
02:41:26,920 --> 02:41:28,079
Come on, Ibuki.

3727
02:41:28,080 --> 02:41:30,719
(Is the leader of OSAKA Ojo Gang Ibuki joining Round 4?)

3728
02:41:30,720 --> 02:41:32,789
It was the perfect beat for her.

3729
02:41:32,790 --> 02:41:34,059
Come on.

3730
02:41:34,060 --> 02:41:35,260
(Let's go.)

3731
02:41:35,760 --> 02:41:36,860
Is she a popper?

3732
02:41:38,260 --> 02:41:40,899
- Let's go. - She was leading the stage.

3733
02:41:40,900 --> 02:41:42,400
- Okay. - Oh, shoot.

3734
02:41:43,830 --> 02:41:45,230
Grab the music, Mo.

3735
02:41:45,570 --> 02:41:47,040
Moana, show them.

3736
02:41:47,300 --> 02:41:48,739
(Go, Moana.)

3737
02:41:48,740 --> 02:41:51,170
Let's go.

3738
02:41:56,240 --> 02:41:57,600
(I can't believe she can do that.)

3739
02:42:03,690 --> 02:42:05,290
Kill it, Moana.

3740
02:42:06,690 --> 02:42:07,760
Nice.

3741
02:42:08,220 --> 02:42:09,520
Let's go.

3742
02:42:10,460 --> 02:42:12,290
(Max excitement)

3743
02:42:19,700 --> 02:42:20,899
Let's go.

3744
02:42:20,900 --> 02:42:21,900
Come on.

3745
02:42:22,070 --> 02:42:23,340
- What's that? - Uwa's good.

3746
02:42:23,940 --> 02:42:26,880
Uwa showed what she could do.

3747
02:42:27,780 --> 02:42:29,080
Nail it.

3748
02:42:29,380 --> 02:42:31,509
It was the perfect moment for her.

3749
02:42:31,510 --> 02:42:35,650
Countdown. Five, four, three, two...

3750
02:42:36,020 --> 02:42:38,690
Three, two, one.

3751
02:42:38,990 --> 02:42:41,119
Battle over.

3752
02:42:41,120 --> 02:42:42,120
(Approving both)

3753
02:42:46,560 --> 02:42:48,199
You redeemed yourself.

3754
02:42:48,200 --> 02:42:49,200
So I love you.

3755
02:42:49,200 --> 02:42:50,200
(Laughing)

3756
02:42:50,330 --> 02:42:51,699
(Good job, Uwa.)

3757
02:42:51,700 --> 02:42:52,769
Good job.

3758
02:42:52,770 --> 02:42:54,100
Nice.

3759
02:42:55,500 --> 02:42:57,370
Nice, Uwa.

3760
02:42:58,840 --> 02:43:00,740
That was really good.

3761
02:43:01,180 --> 02:43:03,010
That was really good.

3762
02:43:03,480 --> 02:43:04,650
I don't even...

3763
02:43:04,810 --> 02:43:05,810
(Stuck)

3764
02:43:05,811 --> 02:43:07,420
What are we supposed to do?

3765
02:43:08,680 --> 02:43:10,220
Uwa did good.

3766
02:43:10,450 --> 02:43:11,849
- Very good battle. - I don't know.

3767
02:43:11,850 --> 02:43:12,919
Both of them were good.

3768
02:43:12,920 --> 02:43:13,920
They ripped off the stage.

3769
02:43:13,921 --> 02:43:15,089
ROYAL FAMILY was good.

3770
02:43:15,090 --> 02:43:16,189
ROYAL's going to win.

3771
02:43:16,190 --> 02:43:18,266
- Who do you think won? - I think it's OSAKA Ojo Gang.

3772
02:43:18,290 --> 02:43:19,429
So OSAKA Ojo Gang.

3773
02:43:19,430 --> 02:43:20,929
It should be Kyoka.

3774
02:43:20,930 --> 02:43:23,199
I think ROYAL FAMILY won.

3775
02:43:23,200 --> 02:43:24,670
What's going to happen?

3776
02:43:24,970 --> 02:43:26,199
This one is hard.

3777
02:43:26,200 --> 02:43:28,370
Everyone's rooting for both crews.

3778
02:43:28,940 --> 02:43:31,240
Two crews' battle is over.

3779
02:43:31,770 --> 02:43:35,709
We really enjoyed this important stage.

3780
02:43:35,710 --> 02:43:37,409
We have no regrets.

3781
02:43:37,410 --> 02:43:39,380
We're full of confidence.

3782
02:43:40,080 --> 02:43:41,679
This is not the end of RF.

3783
02:43:41,680 --> 02:43:43,789
Did the best I could.

3784
02:43:43,790 --> 02:43:45,619
I'm sure that ROYAL FAMILY will win.

3785
02:43:45,620 --> 02:43:48,460
ROYAL FAMILY won't be in the elimination.

3786
02:43:49,290 --> 02:43:52,559
I think it was Maiya and Tiare?

3787
02:43:52,560 --> 02:43:54,629
This battle was full of energy.

3788
02:43:54,630 --> 02:43:57,669
I felt the passion. I felt the hungriness.

3789
02:43:57,670 --> 02:43:58,829
The... You know...

3790
02:43:58,830 --> 02:44:01,469
- Y'all were eating. Left no crumbs. - Okay.

3791
02:44:01,470 --> 02:44:04,070
For real. Everybody. Everyone. Period.

3792
02:44:07,580 --> 02:44:09,679
When Kyoka just came out ready,

3793
02:44:09,680 --> 02:44:12,080
"Pow, pow." I was like...

3794
02:44:12,880 --> 02:44:15,220
Just out the gate, and I feel like that's just again...

3795
02:44:15,680 --> 02:44:17,320
Just raw. Super raw.

3796
02:44:17,550 --> 02:44:19,989
And then Isla started like...

3797
02:44:19,990 --> 02:44:22,819
When you started hitting that,

3798
02:44:22,820 --> 02:44:26,759
and just like showing all sorts of like just so many different weapons,

3799
02:44:26,760 --> 02:44:28,959
it was really cool...

3800
02:44:28,960 --> 02:44:33,130
to see like two different types of masters like going at it.

3801
02:44:33,270 --> 02:44:34,340
Very very cool.

3802
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:36,000
Uwa.

3803
02:44:36,240 --> 02:44:39,769
Uwa with the hits... Hitting poppin' like...

3804
02:44:39,770 --> 02:44:41,879
(The poppin' genius)

3805
02:44:41,880 --> 02:44:45,209
This is really interesting.

3806
02:44:45,210 --> 02:44:47,319
New weapons are being shown in this battles.

3807
02:44:47,320 --> 02:44:48,420
That was y'all's round.

3808
02:44:48,680 --> 02:44:50,150
(Thankful)

3809
02:44:52,020 --> 02:44:54,259
I feel like RF's got those points.

3810
02:44:54,260 --> 02:44:56,659
- I think OSAKA Ojo Gang won. - Yes.

3811
02:44:56,660 --> 02:44:58,729
OSAKA Ojo Gang was darn good today.

3812
02:44:58,730 --> 02:45:02,529
Even if ROYAL FAMILY wins, they need one more win.

3813
02:45:02,530 --> 02:45:04,029
They'll have to dance again.

3814
02:45:04,030 --> 02:45:05,430
It's going to be hard.

3815
02:45:05,800 --> 02:45:07,070
Now,

3816
02:45:07,170 --> 02:45:11,040
we'll check the result of Round Four.

3817
02:45:11,710 --> 02:45:12,809
Please.

3818
02:45:12,810 --> 02:45:14,840
Hold each other, girls. Hold each other.

3819
02:45:15,610 --> 02:45:18,010
Fight Judges, open...

3820
02:45:18,980 --> 02:45:20,850
- I can't watch this. - Please.

3821
02:45:22,420 --> 02:45:23,420
Your cards.

3822
02:45:23,420 --> 02:45:24,420
(Ashley and Back Koo Young choose ROYAL FAMILY.)

3823
02:45:24,420 --> 02:45:25,420
(Kazukiyo chooses OSAKA Ojo Gang.)

3824
02:45:25,421 --> 02:45:27,590
(Exclaiming)

3825
02:45:27,760 --> 02:45:29,219
Oh, my gosh.

3826
02:45:29,220 --> 02:45:30,229
Your cards.

3827
02:45:30,230 --> 02:45:31,230
(Ashley and Back Koo Young choose ROYAL FAMILY.)

3828
02:45:31,231 --> 02:45:32,591
(Kazukiyo chooses OSAKA Ojo Gang.)

3829
02:45:32,630 --> 02:45:34,129
With a score of 4 to 1,

3830
02:45:34,130 --> 02:45:36,670
ROYAL FAMILY wins.

3831
02:45:36,770 --> 02:45:38,430
(Elimination Battle)

3832
02:45:39,300 --> 02:45:41,170
(We won.)

3833
02:45:41,940 --> 02:45:44,170
- One more. - I was happy with the result.

3834
02:45:44,570 --> 02:45:48,809
I was just more focused on going for another round, and...

3835
02:45:48,810 --> 02:45:50,010
getting another win.

3836
02:45:50,310 --> 02:45:51,880
No way. This is wrong.

3837
02:45:55,880 --> 02:45:58,819
I hate it. My heart is like...

3838
02:45:58,820 --> 02:46:01,360
Honestly, we've got nothing to lose.

3839
02:46:01,560 --> 02:46:05,160
The final round of the Elimination Battle is...

3840
02:46:05,390 --> 02:46:07,060
the Leader Battle.

3841
02:46:07,530 --> 02:46:09,460
Everybody's with us.

3842
02:46:10,930 --> 02:46:11,969
We got this.

3843
02:46:11,970 --> 02:46:13,300
Let's go, Ibuki.

3844
02:46:13,900 --> 02:46:14,900
(Nervous)

3845
02:46:14,901 --> 02:46:16,770
- You can do it. - Relax.

3846
02:46:17,570 --> 02:46:18,570
It's Ibuki.

3847
02:46:19,640 --> 02:46:21,609
Ibuki, it's okay. Ibuki, you can do it.

3848
02:46:21,610 --> 02:46:24,179
Should I say pressure? Burden?

3849
02:46:24,180 --> 02:46:26,410
It's different. The level of pressure...

3850
02:46:31,590 --> 02:46:32,650
It's okay.

3851
02:46:33,020 --> 02:46:36,090
I think that was when I felt the weakest here.

3852
02:46:36,390 --> 02:46:39,289
However, as a leader,

3853
02:46:39,290 --> 02:46:41,399
it was time to prove myself.

3854
02:46:41,400 --> 02:46:43,769
She must be under so much pressure as a leader.

3855
02:46:43,770 --> 02:46:46,000
Still, Ibuki is strong.

3856
02:46:46,100 --> 02:46:47,639
(Gather around.)

3857
02:46:47,640 --> 02:46:48,799
Pull yourself together for the battle.

3858
02:46:48,800 --> 02:46:50,309
It's okay. You can do it.

3859
02:46:50,310 --> 02:46:53,739
However, as always, as OSAKA Ojo Gang,

3860
02:46:53,740 --> 02:46:56,309
we were a powerful crew.

3861
02:46:56,310 --> 02:46:57,349
Nail it.

3862
02:46:57,350 --> 02:46:59,450
Blow their minds. Show them the gap.

3863
02:46:59,510 --> 02:47:02,249
I'll win no matter what for my teammates.

3864
02:47:02,250 --> 02:47:04,820
You just freaking kill them. Family's with you.

3865
02:47:05,190 --> 02:47:06,389
Teesha's strong.

3866
02:47:06,390 --> 02:47:07,860
Our bond is strong.

3867
02:47:08,320 --> 02:47:09,689
- Feel our energy. - Yes.

3868
02:47:09,690 --> 02:47:11,589
- I'm confident. - Yes.

3869
02:47:11,590 --> 02:47:13,829
I definitely wanted to win for my team,

3870
02:47:13,830 --> 02:47:16,100
and obviously, my girls counted on me.

3871
02:47:16,230 --> 02:47:17,530
Show them who's queen.

3872
02:47:19,270 --> 02:47:21,999
Ibuki's a world-champion battler.

3873
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:23,740
But I'll kill her on the stage.

3874
02:47:24,110 --> 02:47:26,039
- Let's go. - Ibuki.

3875
02:47:26,040 --> 02:47:27,839
World of Street Woman Fighter.

3876
02:47:27,840 --> 02:47:30,609
Two crews' final all-or-nothing battle...

3877
02:47:30,610 --> 02:47:33,980
for the first elimination will begin.

3878
02:47:35,080 --> 02:47:36,620
Let's go!

3879
02:47:37,290 --> 02:47:38,290
Come on.

3880
02:47:38,291 --> 02:47:40,019
Let's go!

3881
02:47:40,020 --> 02:47:41,120
You guys ready?

3882
02:47:41,690 --> 02:47:42,690
Fight.

3883
02:47:43,460 --> 02:47:45,189
I'm going to win no matter what.

3884
02:47:45,190 --> 02:47:47,300
I don't really feel intimidated.

3885
02:47:48,960 --> 02:47:50,029
(Ibuki of OSAKA Ojo Gang goes first.)

3886
02:47:50,030 --> 02:47:51,030
Let's start.

3887
02:47:51,800 --> 02:47:53,000
(Warming up)

3888
02:47:53,200 --> 02:47:54,200
Let's go.

3889
02:47:54,670 --> 02:47:56,069
I knew Ibuki was good.

3890
02:47:56,070 --> 02:47:57,070
That's crazy.

3891
02:47:57,510 --> 02:47:58,510
Okay.

3892
02:48:00,840 --> 02:48:01,840
Oh, my gosh.

3893
02:48:07,020 --> 02:48:08,020
(Thrilled)

3894
02:48:11,620 --> 02:48:13,149
I was in my battle mode.

3895
02:48:13,150 --> 02:48:14,390
(That's it.)

3896
02:48:16,320 --> 02:48:17,860
Let's go.

3897
02:48:17,930 --> 02:48:19,230
Let's go.

3898
02:48:20,760 --> 02:48:21,960
Let's go, Ibuki.

3899
02:48:30,070 --> 02:48:31,910
Go.

3900
02:48:32,210 --> 02:48:33,540
Go.

3901
02:48:35,180 --> 02:48:36,340
Let's go.

3902
02:48:38,110 --> 02:48:43,080
Countdown. Five, four, three, two, one.

3903
02:48:43,180 --> 02:48:44,320
Switch.

3904
02:48:44,390 --> 02:48:46,420
I was confident that I was going to win.

3905
02:48:46,860 --> 02:48:47,919
Switch.

3906
02:48:47,920 --> 02:48:49,166
(Teesha of ROYAL FAMILY goes next.)

3907
02:48:49,190 --> 02:48:50,230
It's time for me.

3908
02:48:50,830 --> 02:48:52,060
My level is different.

3909
02:48:55,200 --> 02:48:56,430
I will eat.

3910
02:49:03,970 --> 02:49:06,310
She's crazy strong.

3911
02:49:09,880 --> 02:49:11,150
(There goes my leader!)

3912
02:49:11,250 --> 02:49:12,380
Is that all you've got?

3913
02:49:15,520 --> 02:49:17,050
She's really strong.

3914
02:49:18,690 --> 02:49:20,020
Let's go, our T.

3915
02:49:20,390 --> 02:49:21,420
Go, our T.

3916
02:49:22,190 --> 02:49:24,160
- All right. - That's good.

3917
02:49:27,560 --> 02:49:28,860
It was crazy.

3918
02:49:29,630 --> 02:49:30,930
(Scared)

3919
02:49:36,700 --> 02:49:37,710
What's she doing?

3920
02:49:38,840 --> 02:49:43,750
Countdown. Five, four, three, two, one.

3921
02:49:43,850 --> 02:49:46,049
Battle over.

3922
02:49:46,050 --> 02:49:48,290
(Round 5 of the Elimination Battle, Leader Battle ends.)

3923
02:49:49,150 --> 02:49:50,519
(Standing ovation)

3924
02:49:50,520 --> 02:49:51,920
Good job, ladies.

3925
02:49:52,220 --> 02:49:54,589
Literally ate down boots. Period.

3926
02:49:54,590 --> 02:49:56,520
It was giving musicality and strength.

3927
02:49:58,060 --> 02:49:59,889
Good job.

3928
02:49:59,890 --> 02:50:01,800
- I don't know. - It's hard.

3929
02:50:02,460 --> 02:50:04,269
(Also getting nervous)

3930
02:50:04,270 --> 02:50:05,770
The result of this battle...

3931
02:50:05,930 --> 02:50:08,500
will determine one crew...

3932
02:50:08,970 --> 02:50:10,446
that has to leave Street Woman Fighter.

3933
02:50:10,470 --> 02:50:12,009
Fight Judge Back Koo Young.

3934
02:50:12,010 --> 02:50:14,279
What did you think of this battle?

3935
02:50:14,280 --> 02:50:16,979
When I was on "Street Man Fighter,"

3936
02:50:16,980 --> 02:50:19,079
I had experience of participating in the Leader Battle...

3937
02:50:19,080 --> 02:50:23,320
and was in charge of my team's fate.

3938
02:50:23,450 --> 02:50:25,649
I'm well aware of how much that burdens you...

3939
02:50:25,650 --> 02:50:28,259
and the pressure from it.

3940
02:50:28,260 --> 02:50:29,989
Despite all that,

3941
02:50:29,990 --> 02:50:33,329
the energy, technique, and musicality.

3942
02:50:33,330 --> 02:50:36,099
You showed all that.

3943
02:50:36,100 --> 02:50:38,199
You both battled...

3944
02:50:38,200 --> 02:50:40,070
without giving an inch.

3945
02:50:40,370 --> 02:50:43,269
You guys have such different strengths.

3946
02:50:43,270 --> 02:50:44,739
I think in this battle,

3947
02:50:44,740 --> 02:50:48,639
just raw, crazy strength, and power...

3948
02:50:48,640 --> 02:50:53,279
versus technicality, musicality, the flow...

3949
02:50:53,280 --> 02:50:57,019
It's not easy to show who you are...

3950
02:50:57,020 --> 02:51:00,759
when you're dancing under pressure.

3951
02:51:00,760 --> 02:51:02,789
You both overcame that...

3952
02:51:02,790 --> 02:51:05,459
and showed your dance.

3953
02:51:05,460 --> 02:51:07,059
I thought that was very cool.

3954
02:51:07,060 --> 02:51:10,630
It's really hard for me...

3955
02:51:10,830 --> 02:51:12,530
to make the decision.

3956
02:51:12,600 --> 02:51:14,200
(Thank you.)

3957
02:51:16,500 --> 02:51:17,810
We never know.

3958
02:51:18,170 --> 02:51:20,480
I actually think RF got it.

3959
02:51:20,610 --> 02:51:23,040
I think Ibuki won for sure.

3960
02:51:23,210 --> 02:51:26,310
We'll now check the result of the battle.

3961
02:51:26,580 --> 02:51:29,179
When I first joined World of Street Woman Fighter,

3962
02:51:29,180 --> 02:51:30,819
I was here to win.

3963
02:51:30,820 --> 02:51:32,389
I don't want to lose here.

3964
02:51:32,390 --> 02:51:34,619
I feel confident that...

3965
02:51:34,620 --> 02:51:37,530
ROYAL FAMILY won't be in the elimination.

3966
02:51:37,790 --> 02:51:39,390
Fight Judges.

3967
02:51:39,860 --> 02:51:40,860
(Nervous)

3968
02:51:40,861 --> 02:51:42,230
(Curious)

3969
02:51:45,130 --> 02:51:47,400
Open your cards.

3970
02:51:49,540 --> 02:51:50,740
(Sighing)

3971
02:51:50,840 --> 02:51:54,080
(Who will be the first crew to be eliminated?)

3972
02:51:54,180 --> 02:51:57,310
We'll now check the result of the battle.

3973
02:51:57,510 --> 02:52:00,149
When I first joined World of Street Woman Fighter,

3974
02:52:00,150 --> 02:52:01,719
I was here to win.

3975
02:52:01,720 --> 02:52:03,379
I don't want to lose here.

3976
02:52:03,380 --> 02:52:05,589
I feel confident that...

3977
02:52:05,590 --> 02:52:08,490
ROYAL FAMILY won't be in the elimination.

3978
02:52:08,660 --> 02:52:10,320
Fight Judges.

3979
02:52:10,530 --> 02:52:11,859
(Nervous)

3980
02:52:11,860 --> 02:52:13,189
(Curious)

3981
02:52:13,190 --> 02:52:14,559
(Nervous)

3982
02:52:14,560 --> 02:52:16,030
(Please)

3983
02:52:16,060 --> 02:52:18,430
Open your cards.

3984
02:52:20,470 --> 02:52:21,700
(Sighing)

3985
02:52:25,610 --> 02:52:29,039
(Round 5 Leader Battle, Ibuki of OSAKA Ojo Gang wins.)

3986
02:52:29,040 --> 02:52:31,850
(Patting)

3987
02:52:32,080 --> 02:52:33,179
(The final Elimination Battle score, OSAKA Ojo Gang 3, ROYAL FAMILY 2)

3988
02:52:33,180 --> 02:52:35,619
(Nodding)

3989
02:52:35,620 --> 02:52:37,050
(Oh, my goodness)

3990
02:52:37,190 --> 02:52:38,520
Shot, girls.

3991
02:52:38,690 --> 02:52:41,220
They're all crying. Oh, no.

3992
02:52:41,520 --> 02:52:42,890
They're both crying.

3993
02:52:43,760 --> 02:52:46,629
(Ibuki is overwhelmed and can't stop crying.)

3994
02:52:46,630 --> 02:52:50,359
(ROYAL FAMILY was eliminated after the fierce battle.)

3995
02:52:50,360 --> 02:52:54,269
(Well done, everyone.)

3996
02:52:54,270 --> 02:52:55,900
Let's go, Teesha.

3997
02:52:57,210 --> 02:53:00,070
(Overwhelmed)

3998
02:53:00,810 --> 02:53:01,810
No.

3999
02:53:02,840 --> 02:53:04,909
I think that battle...

4000
02:53:04,910 --> 02:53:07,779
really tested OSAKA Ojo Gang's teamwork.

4001
02:53:07,780 --> 02:53:10,119
And I think we overcame...

4002
02:53:10,120 --> 02:53:12,920
the biggest crisis.

4003
02:53:13,150 --> 02:53:14,460
You killed it.

4004
02:53:14,660 --> 02:53:18,889
In all the challenges, they represented themselves so well.

4005
02:53:18,890 --> 02:53:21,799
And 10 years from now, 15 years from now,

4006
02:53:21,800 --> 02:53:25,999
what's going to last is going to be making stuff that you're proud of...

4007
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:28,299
with people that you enjoy spending time with.

4008
02:53:28,300 --> 02:53:30,469
So much love and respect to ROYAL FAMILY.

4009
02:53:30,470 --> 02:53:32,139
I already know they are...

4010
02:53:32,140 --> 02:53:34,340
synonymous with greatness.

4011
02:53:34,440 --> 02:53:37,080
To be honest, this is pretty wild.

4012
02:53:40,280 --> 02:53:42,680
Thank you for the opportunity.

4013
02:53:43,250 --> 02:53:46,020
Thank you to everyone who supported us.

4014
02:53:46,150 --> 02:53:47,890
Our families back home.

4015
02:53:48,420 --> 02:53:51,190
So, yes. Thank you so much.

4016
02:53:51,290 --> 02:53:54,600
(Applause to ROYAL FAMILY who did their best to the end)

4017
02:53:55,430 --> 02:53:56,629
Peace.

4018
02:53:56,630 --> 02:53:58,776
(Time to say goodbye to the colleagues who fought fiercely)

4019
02:53:58,800 --> 02:54:00,000
(Well done.)

4020
02:54:00,130 --> 02:54:01,740
You know that I love you, right?

4021
02:54:04,840 --> 02:54:07,480
Probably the best experience.

4022
02:54:08,140 --> 02:54:10,850
- Teams had a really good time. - Hi. I love your hat.

4023
02:54:11,580 --> 02:54:14,419
It's definitely been a great experience...

4024
02:54:14,420 --> 02:54:16,380
and journey being on the show.

4025
02:54:16,480 --> 02:54:18,649
I'm very thankful that I got to know a lot of the dancers...

4026
02:54:18,650 --> 02:54:19,719
here on the show.

4027
02:54:19,720 --> 02:54:22,459
Never thought I'd ever get to dance with them.

4028
02:54:22,460 --> 02:54:24,889
That's probably my favorite part of this trip.

4029
02:54:24,890 --> 02:54:26,459
This is not the end of RF.

4030
02:54:26,460 --> 02:54:27,999
And life goes on for us.

4031
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:30,329
And we just move onto the next project.

4032
02:54:30,330 --> 02:54:32,829
(As much as how sad this farewell is, )

4033
02:54:32,830 --> 02:54:35,640
(we'll root for ROYAL FAMILY who will shine even more.)

4034
02:54:35,870 --> 02:54:37,510
Love you guys. Thank you.

4035
02:54:38,710 --> 02:54:41,279
Hello, World of Street Woman Fighter dancers.

4036
02:54:41,280 --> 02:54:42,779
It's Jennie here.

4037
02:54:42,780 --> 02:54:44,810
And I've got a special mission for you.

4038
02:54:44,910 --> 02:54:47,949
The iconic Mega Crew Mission.

4039
02:54:47,950 --> 02:54:49,149
(The signature of "Street Woman Fighter" series, Mega Crew Mission)

4040
02:54:49,150 --> 02:54:51,490
But this time, it's on another level.

4041
02:54:51,920 --> 02:54:54,459
You'll head back to your home countries...

4042
02:54:54,460 --> 02:54:58,830
and create a performance that shows the true identity of your nation.

4043
02:55:00,830 --> 02:55:02,559
This isn't just about dancing.

4044
02:55:02,560 --> 02:55:05,770
It's about telling your country's story the most.

4045
02:55:06,200 --> 02:55:08,140
And I've got a special mission for you.

4046
02:55:08,670 --> 02:55:10,769
It must include at least 20 seconds...

4047
02:55:10,770 --> 02:55:13,740
of the high-angle challenge section.

4048
02:55:15,910 --> 02:55:18,850
A giant scale performance battle...

4049
02:55:19,910 --> 02:55:22,320
created all over the world in the name of their countries.

4050
02:55:23,180 --> 02:55:25,019
The votes for the Mega Crew Mission will be counted...

4051
02:55:25,020 --> 02:55:27,820
on World of Street Woman Fighter's official channel The CHOOM.

4052
02:55:27,990 --> 02:55:30,760
Vote for the Mega Crew Mission now.

4053
02:55:31,390 --> 02:55:34,200
We're going shopping for some K-food.

4054
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:36,559
Do you have whole sesame seeds?

4055
02:55:36,560 --> 02:55:38,070
Do you have eggs?

4056
02:55:38,330 --> 02:55:39,600
(Yummy)

4057
02:55:39,700 --> 02:55:40,969
(Shopping...)

4058
02:55:40,970 --> 02:55:42,440
(like crazy)

4059
02:55:42,600 --> 02:55:43,870
We don't have money.

4060
02:55:44,210 --> 02:55:45,540
(Watch out for indulgence.)

4061
02:55:45,610 --> 02:55:47,280
(AG SQUAD experiences Korea.)

4062
02:55:49,280 --> 02:55:50,410
(Yours is mine.)

4063
02:55:50,580 --> 02:55:51,609
(Sorry, sister.)

4064
02:55:51,610 --> 02:55:52,979
- APT - APT

4065
02:55:52,980 --> 02:55:55,979
(RHTokyo in sauna)

4066
02:55:55,980 --> 02:55:57,050
(Oh, hot!)

4067
02:55:58,020 --> 02:55:59,249
(Getting used to the K-temperature gap)

4068
02:55:59,250 --> 02:56:00,920
(Flying)

4069
02:56:01,290 --> 02:56:02,459
(In the meantime, where did BUMSUP go?)

4070
02:56:02,460 --> 02:56:04,089
You're all crybabies.

4071
02:56:04,090 --> 02:56:07,360
(Exploding with questions)

4072
02:56:07,860 --> 02:56:09,160
(Let me see.)

4073
02:56:09,900 --> 02:56:12,300
(What's going to happen to BUMSUP?)

4074
02:56:13,170 --> 02:56:15,770
Party girls. I love swimming.

4075
02:56:16,200 --> 02:56:19,910
(A special pool party for the crews that survived)

4076
02:56:20,410 --> 02:56:25,149
(Let's have fun.)

4077
02:56:25,150 --> 02:56:27,880
(Happy)

4078
02:56:28,580 --> 02:56:29,750
(Luxurious party food)

4079
02:56:30,950 --> 02:56:31,950
(Really?)

4080
02:56:32,620 --> 02:56:34,360
(Jennie appears.)

4081
02:56:35,720 --> 02:56:36,789
That was Jennie.

4082
02:56:36,790 --> 02:56:38,029
Is that Jennie? Are you sure this is right?

4083
02:56:38,030 --> 02:56:40,730
Oh, my gosh. She's going to tell us the next mission.

4084
02:56:40,930 --> 02:56:43,429
You'll head back to your home countries...

4085
02:56:43,430 --> 02:56:46,829
and create a performance that shows the true identity...

4086
02:56:46,830 --> 02:56:48,139
of your nation.

4087
02:56:48,140 --> 02:56:50,139
They'll go back to their countries.

4088
02:56:50,140 --> 02:56:52,469
I knew we had to represent our countries.

4089
02:56:52,470 --> 02:56:54,440
Country's story for your most.

4090
02:56:55,180 --> 02:56:57,240
Good morning, guys. It is...

4091
02:56:58,150 --> 02:57:01,119
a week before we shoot our Mega Crew Mission.

4092
02:57:01,120 --> 02:57:03,379
I am just here in Gold Coast looking at...

4093
02:57:03,380 --> 02:57:07,119
locations for our intro and outro.

4094
02:57:07,120 --> 02:57:09,159
(Global scale location)

4095
02:57:09,160 --> 02:57:11,729
Tokyo is known...

4096
02:57:11,730 --> 02:57:13,859
for Shibuya Scramble.

4097
02:57:13,860 --> 02:57:18,029
We're shooting at the subway platform.

4098
02:57:18,030 --> 02:57:20,799
(All Tokyo residents appear.)

4099
02:57:20,800 --> 02:57:22,640
(You're the best, Father!)

4100
02:57:23,800 --> 02:57:26,439
(The Mega Crew Mission shoot continues in the arcade.)

4101
