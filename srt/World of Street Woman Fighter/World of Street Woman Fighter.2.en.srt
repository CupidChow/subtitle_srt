00:00:33,981 --> 00:00:37,051
(World of Street Woman Fighter)

2
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:39,921
This is my first time in Korea.

3
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:41,390
I'm excited.

4
00:00:41,391 --> 00:00:42,490
(Screaming in excitement)

5
00:00:42,491 --> 00:00:44,961
We're just grateful to be here representing the USA.

6
00:00:45,761 --> 00:00:48,830
- Hey, we are MOTIV crew.
- MOTIV crew.

7
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:50,531
- What's your motive?
- What's your motive?

8
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:54,240
We're on our way to Korea.

9
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:56,570
As a crew representing Japan,

10
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:59,141
OSAKA Ojo Gang is participating in World of Street Woman Fighter.

11
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:01,940
Japan represents! I want us to win.

12
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:03,340
- We have arrived.
- We have arrived.

13
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:06,010
I'm from AG SQUAD from Australia.

14
00:01:06,011 --> 00:01:07,921
We're more than happy to represent Australia.

15
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,051
We're here.

16
00:01:10,251 --> 00:01:11,950
RHTokyo is here...

17
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:14,490
to win as a team representing Japan.

18
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,761
- We're RHTokyo!
- We're RHTokyo!

19
00:01:17,861 --> 00:01:19,360
- Hello.
- New Zealand...

20
00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:21,830
is being represented by the ROYAL FAMILY.

21
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,400
- Hello.
- Hello.

22
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:24,531
Korea.

23
00:01:24,971 --> 00:01:27,571
We are the best in the world, and we'll still be the best.

24
00:01:29,501 --> 00:01:30,511
Crowns up.

25
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:32,810
(The dancers of South Korea...)

26
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:35,340
(have been ready for a long time.)

27
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:37,881
We're tougher than we look.

28
00:01:38,151 --> 00:01:40,580
- With the tiger's spirit, BUMSUP.
- With the tiger's spirit, BUMSUP.

29
00:01:40,581 --> 00:01:42,480
- Come on!
- Let's go!

30
00:01:42,481 --> 00:01:45,590
I am so honored to be representing my nation.

31
00:01:45,591 --> 00:01:48,690
I was so excited to be representing Japan.

32
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:49,691
Hey, guys.

33
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:52,130
We heard that it's snowing,

34
00:01:52,131 --> 00:01:53,730
so we're going to have a look at...

35
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:55,061
some snow because...

36
00:01:55,131 --> 00:01:57,071
we Aussies don't know what that is.

37
00:01:57,301 --> 00:01:58,871
We've never experienced that in our lives.

38
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:03,301
Definitely really excited, however...

39
00:02:03,611 --> 00:02:04,740
Would you like to hold my hand?

40
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:06,270
We can hold hands, yes.

41
00:02:06,271 --> 00:02:08,810
I mean it's definitely a concerning feeling.

42
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:11,710
We're competing with Korea's pride on the line.

43
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:14,750
So in the competition, it's going to be competitive.

44
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:16,320
Let's take everything from them and protect what we have.

45
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:17,390
Let's finish them!

46
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:19,721
- Let's finish them!
- Let's finish them!

47
00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:21,661
This is what Korea's all about.

48
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:24,690
We'll do our best and just kill it.

49
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:25,730
Oi!

50
00:02:25,731 --> 00:02:27,931
We'll really show them what Australia is all about.

51
00:02:28,101 --> 00:02:32,031
Team New Zealand, ROYAL FAMILY, is very confident.

52
00:02:32,531 --> 00:02:34,271
We're also ready to eat.

53
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:36,270
We'll prove that...

54
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:39,710
we are the dance crew representing Japan.

55
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:41,541
You think you represent Japan?

56
00:02:41,841 --> 00:02:43,211
Japan versus Japan.

57
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:44,481
We're going to win no matter what.

58
00:02:44,811 --> 00:02:47,080
We are first at the end of the show.

59
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:50,120
- We got that US flavor.
- Flavor. Yes, the USA.

60
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:51,751
Because we got the essence.

61
00:02:55,291 --> 00:03:01,161
Logistx is crowned Red Bull BC One.

62
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:03,400
My name is Logan,

63
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:05,530
a.k.a B-girl Logistx.

64
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:08,940
Being from the USA, representing breaking.

65
00:03:08,941 --> 00:03:10,570
I also did the Summer Games.

66
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:13,711
Breaking was included in the Summer Games last year, in 2024.

67
00:03:13,741 --> 00:03:17,851
I won Silverback Open in 2018, which is 1 of the biggest...

68
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:20,851
I won Red Bull BC 1 in 2021.

69
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:24,220
This show needs real battlers.

70
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:26,050
And that would just be a great moment...

71
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:29,621
for the world and for the show, and for the world to see.

72
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:34,230
I felt really proud to represent Team USA.

73
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:37,230
MOTIV's Logistx.

74
00:03:37,231 --> 00:03:38,971
(Logistx was on the national team, and she is stepping in.)

75
00:03:39,231 --> 00:03:40,840
(Finally,)

76
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:42,771
(the time has come.)

77
00:03:43,401 --> 00:03:44,540
Let's go!

78
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,780
She represented the US at the Summer Games. Breakdancing.

79
00:03:47,781 --> 00:03:50,451
I love it. I love to love.

80
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:55,581
She was literally a member of the US national team.

81
00:03:56,281 --> 00:03:57,350
Gosh.

82
00:03:57,351 --> 00:04:01,321
(Who will Logistx be battling against?)

83
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:03,931
(She points her finger at someone right away.)

84
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:09,201
Lip J.

85
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:13,841
(Lip J of Team Korea, BUMSUP)

86
00:04:15,141 --> 00:04:17,240
(Shocked)

87
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:19,411
Goodness.

88
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:21,540
She's doing that out of respect. She's like,

89
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,011
"I know you're one of the top."

90
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:24,651
Seeing this live.

91
00:04:25,651 --> 00:04:27,081
You got this, Lip J!

92
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,781
You represent Korea too.

93
00:04:28,921 --> 00:04:30,251
Only Korea has Lip J.

94
00:04:30,451 --> 00:04:33,490
She's at a national representative level.

95
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:34,820
She's the embodiment of waacking itself,

96
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:36,360
and she's on our team.

97
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:38,290
As a dancer representing Korea,

98
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:41,730
I've participated in a lot of dance battles...

99
00:04:41,731 --> 00:04:45,830
globally, and I've been a judge at many global competitions too.

100
00:04:45,831 --> 00:04:48,541
I think everyone would know who I am.

101
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:51,611
I picked Lip J because I respect her so much.

102
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:53,011
She represents Korea,

103
00:04:53,341 --> 00:04:56,141
and I wanted to challenge her.

104
00:04:56,241 --> 00:04:59,151
We have world champions going at it,

105
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:01,281
that in any other scenario...

106
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:03,680
would not be going at it like this.

107
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:04,720
I like this battle.

108
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,721
(Excited)

109
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,791
What a great battle.

110
00:05:07,491 --> 00:05:09,620
Team USA's Logistx versus...

111
00:05:09,621 --> 00:05:12,060
Team Korea, BUMSUP's Lip J.

112
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,061
Ready?

113
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:14,061
(World Battle)

114
00:05:14,062 --> 00:05:15,100
Fight!

115
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:16,661
Let's go!

116
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:20,101
I've got to come with a strong intro.

117
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,711
(All eyes on Logistx)

118
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:29,941
(Extreme excitement)

119
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:39,891
(This is what we wanted to see!)

120
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:46,630
Let's go!

121
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:47,901
(This is so fun!)

122
00:05:48,301 --> 00:05:50,431
Let's go, Lip J!

123
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:54,170
Lip J!

124
00:05:54,171 --> 00:05:55,300
(Startled)

125
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:56,401
(Cheering)

126
00:05:56,971 --> 00:05:58,941
Lip J, let's go!

127
00:06:01,411 --> 00:06:02,711
(That was smart of Lip J.)

128
00:06:10,121 --> 00:06:11,651
(Shouts of joy)

129
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:17,091
(This is so exciting.)

130
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,001
(It's like they're in perfect sync.)

131
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:25,471
What is going on?

132
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:27,940
When else would I get to battle her?

133
00:06:27,941 --> 00:06:29,470
- It's fun.
- I'm excited.

134
00:06:29,471 --> 00:06:31,271
It's an honor to battle Lip J.

135
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:35,511
(The crowd is going wild.)

136
00:06:35,641 --> 00:06:36,781
So exciting!

137
00:06:38,351 --> 00:06:40,010
(In perfect harmony)

138
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:41,151
(Electrifying)

139
00:06:49,861 --> 00:06:53,960
Five, four, three, two, one.

140
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:56,131
Battle over!

141
00:06:56,861 --> 00:06:58,730
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

142
00:06:58,731 --> 00:07:00,471
What?

143
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:04,411
(Genuinely moved)

144
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:07,241
(A one-of-a-kind match between national-level arms and legs)

145
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:10,540
That was sick.

146
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:11,710
You're amazing.

147
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:13,211
That was really sexy.

148
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:14,580
That was so special.

149
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:15,751
(In love)

150
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:18,751
Let's check the result of the battle.

151
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:23,091
Fight Judges, open your cards.

152
00:07:27,461 --> 00:07:29,000
The final score is 2 to 1.

153
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:32,801
Team USA, MOTIV's Logistx takes the win.

154
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:33,901
Yes.

155
00:07:34,841 --> 00:07:36,400
- You did great.
- You still did great.

156
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:37,471
You still did great.

157
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,750
This is massive respect.

158
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:48,750
This is the most, craziest setup of a battle.

159
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:50,951
We have two stars here.

160
00:07:51,251 --> 00:07:52,890
Two stars.

161
00:07:52,891 --> 00:07:54,890
You guys both should be proud of yourselves.

162
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,061
Great jobs for representing your countries.

163
00:07:57,691 --> 00:08:02,200
I was proud to represent the USA.

164
00:08:02,201 --> 00:08:05,330
It's more proven to everyone else in the room.

165
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:06,600
But we're just excited.

166
00:08:06,601 --> 00:08:08,041
It's just begun.

167
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:10,340
They really hyped things up.

168
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:11,341
Let them know.

169
00:08:11,611 --> 00:08:13,410
The dancers individually.

170
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:16,741
I think that they do represent their countries well.

171
00:08:17,211 --> 00:08:18,810
By pushing and inspiring each other,

172
00:08:18,811 --> 00:08:23,281
we were reminded once again of how intense the dance scene is.

173
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:25,151
This is a world battle.

174
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:28,690
We're competing with our pride on the line.

175
00:08:28,691 --> 00:08:31,290
This is an important challenge for us.

176
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:35,100
It'll be amazing to see what we can bring to the world.

177
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:36,231
Are you guys ready?

178
00:08:38,171 --> 00:08:39,171
Fight!

179
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:42,800
World of Street Woman Fighter is powered by...

180
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:46,571
product sponsorship and partnership with a leading K-culture brand.

181
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:49,710
Only six crews that...

182
00:08:49,711 --> 00:08:53,451
each represents their countries are gathered here,

183
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:56,620
at World of Street Woman Fighter.

184
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:59,050
The word "country" makes us...

185
00:08:59,051 --> 00:09:00,650
So we're not here for fun.

186
00:09:00,651 --> 00:09:01,691
We're here to win.

187
00:09:01,961 --> 00:09:03,961
(The pride of each country was at stake for the first dance battle.)

188
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:06,330
(No Respect World Battle)

189
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:08,131
(The final result of the first round)

190
00:09:08,361 --> 00:09:09,561
(Which crew ranked first place?)

191
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:12,030
We're from where hip-hop began.

192
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:13,300
She's a veteran.

193
00:09:13,301 --> 00:09:14,370
(MOTIV has been racking up points with their continued victories.)

194
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:17,141
(Team New Zealand, ROYAL FAMILY, shares 1st place.)

195
00:09:17,301 --> 00:09:18,870
Why are there so many?

196
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:22,311
(ROYAL FAMILY had been treated as the weakest crew.)

197
00:09:22,611 --> 00:09:23,641
They don't know us.

198
00:09:24,011 --> 00:09:27,010
They proved that what led ROYAL FAMILY wasn't past...

199
00:09:27,011 --> 00:09:28,481
but present.

200
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,581
(ROYAL FAMILY is beating us.)

201
00:09:30,681 --> 00:09:32,720
(AG SQUAD lost to ROYAL FAMILY in every battle.)

202
00:09:32,721 --> 00:09:33,721
(The tail is wagging the dog.)

203
00:09:33,722 --> 00:09:36,920
(I was annoyed because it was against ROYAL FAMILY.)

204
00:09:36,921 --> 00:09:39,531
(We are the faces of ROYAL FAMILY now.)

205
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:43,430
Meanwhile, Team Korea, BUMSUP, had the most number of losses.

206
00:09:43,431 --> 00:09:46,230
(I don't think they're at the level for the world tournaments.)

207
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:48,200
(They look easy to beat. No jokes.)

208
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:49,201
(Underdog)

209
00:09:49,301 --> 00:09:50,601
(I was so angry.)

210
00:09:50,711 --> 00:09:52,240
(BUMSUP became the weakest team.)

211
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:53,771
(Will they be able to avert the crisis?)

212
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:55,810
(No Respect World Battle, Relay Team Battle)

213
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:56,811
(A chance to change the rankings,)

214
00:09:56,811 --> 00:09:57,811
(Double Score System)

215
00:09:57,851 --> 00:09:58,851
(It motivated me.)

216
00:09:58,852 --> 00:10:00,011
(I was full of determination.)

217
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:01,480
(Let's avoid placing last.)

218
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:02,621
(I'll get the double-win no matter what.)

219
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:04,121
(We want a rematch.)

220
00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:05,121
(Come on out right now.)

221
00:10:05,391 --> 00:10:06,391
(Okay.)

222
00:10:06,392 --> 00:10:07,560
(We'll win again.)

223
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:09,020
(AG SQUAD is strong enough...)

224
00:10:09,021 --> 00:10:10,191
(to get back on track.)

225
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,961
(Get the revenge.)

226
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:13,031
(Class Mission,)

227
00:10:13,032 --> 00:10:14,160
(the flower of Street Woman Fighter)

228
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:15,760
(Will I be a backup dancer if I fail to be a main dancer?)

229
00:10:15,761 --> 00:10:16,761
(Chuckling)

230
00:10:16,762 --> 00:10:18,371
(There's nothing more humiliating than that.)

231
00:10:19,631 --> 00:10:20,631
(Amazed)

232
00:10:20,632 --> 00:10:21,800
(I was really confident.)

233
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:22,900
(It looks like they won already!)

234
00:10:22,901 --> 00:10:24,210
(I don't care who comes.)

235
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:25,811
(This is mine.)

236
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:27,980
(Leader class has a strong competition.)

237
00:10:27,981 --> 00:10:30,010
(Everyone has years of experience.)

238
00:10:30,011 --> 00:10:31,950
(It was a neck-and-neck match...)

239
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:33,280
(that couldn't get more competitive.)

240
00:10:33,281 --> 00:10:34,281
(It's a hard decision.)

241
00:11:01,381 --> 00:11:05,011
The second half of No Respect World Battle...

242
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:06,280
begins now.

243
00:11:06,281 --> 00:11:08,950
(Let's go.)

244
00:11:08,951 --> 00:11:11,191
The first half was an individual event,

245
00:11:11,491 --> 00:11:12,491
but the second half is...

246
00:11:12,591 --> 00:11:13,591
(What is it?)

247
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:14,591
a team competition.

248
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:19,161
It's the Relay Team Battle between the crews.

249
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:21,161
Relay Team Battle?

250
00:11:21,901 --> 00:11:24,371
We'll finally get to dance as a team.

251
00:11:24,431 --> 00:11:27,231
RHTokyo has strong teamwork.

252
00:11:27,671 --> 00:11:29,741
We can show it with confidence.

253
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:34,210
In the second half, a new rule will allow you to change...

254
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:35,911
the rankings completely.

255
00:11:36,311 --> 00:11:37,311
A new rule?

256
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:38,711
It's...

257
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:42,281
the Double Score System.

258
00:11:42,781 --> 00:11:43,921
Double score?

259
00:11:44,221 --> 00:11:45,251
(This is our chance.)

260
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:48,821
If you win in a team battle, you'll get twice the winning points.

261
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:51,361
We'll get two wins.

262
00:11:51,362 --> 00:11:52,391
This is our chance.

263
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:55,461
We need to seize this chance to go up.

264
00:11:55,831 --> 00:11:57,301
We need to take many wins in the second half.

265
00:11:57,531 --> 00:11:59,031
Let's escape the bottom place.

266
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:01,841
But if you lose in a team battle,

267
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:05,541
Double loss will seriously hurt the crew.

268
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:06,841
Oh, no.

269
00:12:07,011 --> 00:12:08,340
Oh.

270
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:09,341
Minus?

271
00:12:09,841 --> 00:12:11,581
Twice the points at once?

272
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:13,481
It'll be dangerous if we lose.

273
00:12:13,851 --> 00:12:15,851
I don't think that we'll lose...

274
00:12:17,021 --> 00:12:19,391
because if you add it to your scoreboard,

275
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,091
it'll work in our favor.

276
00:12:21,861 --> 00:12:24,761
We don't need two crews to represent Japan.

277
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:28,601
OSAKA Ojo Gang wasn't very impressive.

278
00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:34,571
Let's beat a Japanese crew first and take on the international ones.

279
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:38,271
If you guys let your guard down, you'll be very sorry.

280
00:12:38,911 --> 00:12:41,741
AG SQUAD is strong enough to get back on track.

281
00:12:41,981 --> 00:12:44,351
I'm excited because we're ready to eat.

282
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:46,751
We were going to stay where we were.

283
00:12:47,011 --> 00:12:49,721
- Let's kill the team battle.
- Let's kill it.

284
00:12:49,881 --> 00:12:51,121
We'll get the double-win no matter what.

285
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:54,221
(What will be the result of the Relay Team Battle?)

286
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:57,191
Which crew will participate in the Relay Team Battle now?

287
00:12:58,191 --> 00:12:59,191
I'm excited.

288
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:02,431
It's the crew that placed 4th in the 1st half. It's Team Japan,

289
00:13:02,601 --> 00:13:04,531
OSAKA Ojo Gang.

290
00:13:06,901 --> 00:13:08,001
They came fourth?

291
00:13:08,301 --> 00:13:10,101
They're angry. They're really angry.

292
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:11,871
(Yes, we're angry.)

293
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:14,010
I was expecting OSAKA Ojo Gang...

294
00:13:14,011 --> 00:13:15,981
to dominate the battles, to be honest.

295
00:13:16,411 --> 00:13:17,851
(OSAKA Ojo Gang received the fewest No Respect stickers.)

296
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:19,281
(I want to have a battle right away.)

297
00:13:19,281 --> 00:13:20,281
(100 percent of confidence)

298
00:13:20,282 --> 00:13:22,281
But they lost.

299
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:24,451
I don't think OSAKA Ojo Gang won any of the battles.

300
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:26,251
I'm just so shocked.

301
00:13:27,151 --> 00:13:28,691
(Crew Room before entering the fight zone)

302
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:31,391
The second crew that's expected to win?

303
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,561
(Clapping)

304
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,361
(OSAKA Ojo Gang began happily thanks to the high ranking.)

305
00:13:36,261 --> 00:13:37,901
(This is the class of Osaka.)

306
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:40,331
It made me think, "We're seen as a strong crew..."

307
00:13:40,531 --> 00:13:42,701
"by other crews."

308
00:13:43,901 --> 00:13:46,710
When we entered the fight zone, I really felt like...

309
00:13:46,711 --> 00:13:50,841
it was the place where we could show our skills the best.

310
00:13:52,981 --> 00:13:54,421
(However,)

311
00:13:54,621 --> 00:13:56,721
(contrary to their expectations, they continued to lose.)

312
00:13:57,151 --> 00:13:59,620
The strongest battlers in our crew...

313
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:01,461
are Ibuki and Kyoka.

314
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,691
The two of us didn't win once in the battles.

315
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:06,331
Is this okay?

316
00:14:06,961 --> 00:14:08,301
- We're in trouble.
- We're in trouble.

317
00:14:08,601 --> 00:14:09,861
(RHTokyo became excited after beating OSAKA Ojo Gang.)

318
00:14:12,071 --> 00:14:13,331
OSAKA Ojo Gang will be annoyed.

319
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:16,201
I really want to kill them.

320
00:14:16,801 --> 00:14:18,271
While we took losses,

321
00:14:18,371 --> 00:14:21,111
RHTokyo took wins.

322
00:14:22,141 --> 00:14:24,111
From head to toe,

323
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:25,451
I was burning.

324
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:27,980
Which crew should we pick?

325
00:14:27,981 --> 00:14:29,881
The loser will take double loss.

326
00:14:30,751 --> 00:14:33,221
No matter hard I think about it...

327
00:14:34,861 --> 00:14:35,991
Rie Hata, right?

328
00:14:37,991 --> 00:14:38,991
Shall we do that?

329
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:44,030
The crew to whom we'll give...

330
00:14:44,031 --> 00:14:48,301
a taste of double loss is...

331
00:14:53,071 --> 00:14:55,741
Team Japan.

332
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,081
(We've waited for this moment.)

333
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:01,551
Team Japan versus Team Japan.

334
00:15:01,921 --> 00:15:04,081
I knew that would happen.

335
00:15:05,251 --> 00:15:06,450
I have goosebumps.

336
00:15:06,451 --> 00:15:07,451
(Goosebumps)

337
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:10,561
RHTokyo, we're in your care.

338
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:13,531
(We're ready to eat you guys up!)

339
00:15:13,861 --> 00:15:15,101
It was fun.

340
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:18,331
I was thankful that they chose us.

341
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:20,101
We'll beat them again.

342
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:24,940
Our crew was considered weak in terms of battles.

343
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:28,480
Everyone seemed to be saying, "You guys can't win."

344
00:15:28,481 --> 00:15:29,481
Such things made me angry.

345
00:15:30,641 --> 00:15:33,010
(RHTokyo proved themselves in battles...)

346
00:15:33,011 --> 00:15:34,351
(against everyone's expectations.)

347
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:37,121
Did you see that?

348
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:39,590
Now, we aren't scared of anything.

349
00:15:39,591 --> 00:15:40,890
We want to hurry up and dance.

350
00:15:40,891 --> 00:15:43,221
Now comes a chance to dance together.

351
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:45,260
- Finally!
- Let's just...

352
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:46,731
do as we did during practice.

353
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:48,461
We won't lose in a team battle.

354
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:50,461
We'll definitely win this time.

355
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:52,801
That's the true fun of a battle.

356
00:15:53,071 --> 00:15:54,401
I thought, "Will you guys be able to win?"

357
00:15:54,741 --> 00:15:58,470
The OSAKA Ojo Gang members are too different.

358
00:15:58,471 --> 00:16:00,811
I'm certain that they won't be able to show their skills.

359
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:04,181
RHTokyo has strong teamwork.

360
00:16:04,451 --> 00:16:06,410
The crew members trust each other.

361
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:07,680
- RHTokyo!
- RHTokyo!

362
00:16:07,681 --> 00:16:08,681
(RHTokyo is confident since they've been together long.)

363
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:10,421
Let's win no matter what.

364
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:12,851
I don't know if they were happy or what.

365
00:16:13,691 --> 00:16:15,620
They looked excited.

366
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:16,621
Good. Shall we have a proper match?

367
00:16:16,961 --> 00:16:19,831
We don't need two crews to represent Japan anyway.

368
00:16:20,031 --> 00:16:21,800
Which crew represents Japan?

369
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:24,971
RHTokyo will be the crew that represents Japan.

370
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:26,071
No way.

371
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:28,671
As an Osaka resident, I can't forgive such a thing.

372
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:30,770
"Between Osaka and Tokyo,"

373
00:16:30,771 --> 00:16:32,811
"which region's dance crew is stronger?"

374
00:16:32,941 --> 00:16:34,941
Even people in Japan will pay attention.

375
00:16:35,381 --> 00:16:36,811
We're here to win.

376
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:39,151
We have no intention to lose.

377
00:16:40,011 --> 00:16:41,521
I'll do anything to win.

378
00:16:42,121 --> 00:16:44,350
It's like watching a fire across the river. It was just fun.

379
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:45,621
(This is so much fun.)

380
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:48,261
Where's my popcorn? I need my popcorn.

381
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:53,360
The two crews that represent Japan will have a match.

382
00:16:53,361 --> 00:16:56,030
Finally, the real Japanese battle is here.

383
00:16:56,031 --> 00:16:58,171
- Okay. I'm going to enjoy this one.
- Oh, yes.

384
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,271
Relay Team Battle starts now.

385
00:17:02,801 --> 00:17:05,611
DJ SOM, drop the beat!

386
00:17:06,271 --> 00:17:07,411
(OSAKA Ojo Gang goes 1st for Section 1.)

387
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:09,241
(Let's go!)

388
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:10,741
(Everyone's attention is on them.)

389
00:17:11,141 --> 00:17:12,451
(Who will come out?)

390
00:17:13,781 --> 00:17:15,450
- Okay.
- Yes!

391
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,021
I've practiced dancing to this song.

392
00:17:19,451 --> 00:17:21,321
We were like, "Minami and Junna should go."

393
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:23,021
- Which one?
- This one.

394
00:17:23,161 --> 00:17:24,191
Let's get it!

395
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:27,631
Aren't they going too fast?

396
00:17:27,632 --> 00:17:29,501
I was like, "That isn't it."

397
00:17:31,831 --> 00:17:33,001
Keep going!

398
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:36,601
Do your best.

399
00:17:39,011 --> 00:17:40,611
We'll give it our all.

400
00:17:50,521 --> 00:17:51,521
Minami is something else.

401
00:17:51,521 --> 00:17:52,521
Minami!

402
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:57,791
Junna!

403
00:17:59,031 --> 00:18:00,091
- Yes!
- Hey.

404
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:02,561
Hey.

405
00:18:06,771 --> 00:18:08,471
Hold on. One, two.

406
00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:12,941
It was annoying.

407
00:18:13,371 --> 00:18:14,371
(Go!)

408
00:18:14,372 --> 00:18:15,380
Okay. Shall I go?

409
00:18:15,381 --> 00:18:17,781
Countdown! Five, four,

410
00:18:18,011 --> 00:18:19,811
- three, two, - Let's go!

411
00:18:19,911 --> 00:18:21,011
- No way. This is insane.
- one.

412
00:18:21,111 --> 00:18:22,151
This is so exciting.

413
00:18:22,821 --> 00:18:23,821
Bring it on.

414
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:26,490
- Switch! RHTokyo!
- I was confident.

415
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:28,021
One, two, three.

416
00:18:28,521 --> 00:18:31,221
We have better teamwork.

417
00:18:31,831 --> 00:18:32,831
Hey.

418
00:18:33,461 --> 00:18:34,461
(Let's see it.)

419
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:36,731
Hey.

420
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:41,271
I have no idea what they're doing.

421
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:44,811
- Hey.
- Hey.

422
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:48,011
Let's do this in the battle mode!

423
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:53,481
(Let me dance as well.)

424
00:18:58,121 --> 00:18:59,121
Is that all?

425
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:00,491
Shall we show them?

426
00:19:03,221 --> 00:19:05,431
We're stronger when it comes to team competitions.

427
00:19:05,631 --> 00:19:06,691
We'll definitely win.

428
00:19:10,431 --> 00:19:11,431
(Here comes Tokyo.)

429
00:19:13,601 --> 00:19:14,741
That was crazy.

430
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:16,370
(Moving forward while waacking)

431
00:19:16,371 --> 00:19:18,771
- Countdown! Five, four, - Waacking?

432
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,511
- three, two, one.
- I thought, "We'll win this one."

433
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:23,340
Section, switch.

434
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:24,651
(1-on-1 Simultaneous Battle, start!)

435
00:19:25,211 --> 00:19:26,211
(Standing up)

436
00:19:26,211 --> 00:19:27,211
Come on!

437
00:19:27,212 --> 00:19:29,321
(Who will be the solo battler for Section 2?)

438
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:31,690
It's hip-hop.

439
00:19:31,691 --> 00:19:33,490
Should we go?

440
00:19:33,491 --> 00:19:34,491
(Kyoka goes first.)

441
00:19:35,191 --> 00:19:36,290
I don't mind anyone. Bring it on.

442
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,620
(This is it!)

443
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:39,591
(Who will be the battler to go against Kyoka?)

444
00:19:40,331 --> 00:19:41,401
Go, Mona.

445
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:44,100
Honestly, I thought...

446
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:46,031
I didn't need 40 seconds to battle against Mona.

447
00:19:47,301 --> 00:19:48,371
I won't lose.

448
00:19:53,271 --> 00:19:54,271
Bring it on.

449
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:58,011
Let's go!

450
00:20:00,351 --> 00:20:01,651
(She's shocked.)

451
00:20:05,451 --> 00:20:06,451
Listen.

452
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:07,551
(This is how you dance.)

453
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:09,720
Let's go!

454
00:20:09,721 --> 00:20:12,091
Let's go!

455
00:20:16,001 --> 00:20:17,430
She nailed it.

456
00:20:17,431 --> 00:20:18,531
Just enjoy it!

457
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:21,571
Honestly, I beat her easily.

458
00:20:24,811 --> 00:20:25,811
(She challenges her calmly.)

459
00:20:27,011 --> 00:20:28,111
(I love that.)

460
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,950
- I thought I didn't want to lose.
- Countdown! Five, four,

461
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:34,580
- three, two, one.
- I was just having fun.

462
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:37,020
Last section, switch.

463
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:38,150
(Who will be the battlers of the two crews?)

464
00:20:38,151 --> 00:20:39,190
(Doubting her eyes)

465
00:20:39,191 --> 00:20:40,291
Let's go!

466
00:20:41,021 --> 00:20:42,291
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's Ibuki steps forward.)

467
00:20:42,561 --> 00:20:44,090
(Who will come out from RHTokyo?)

468
00:20:44,091 --> 00:20:45,091
Rena.

469
00:20:45,131 --> 00:20:46,131
Let's go!

470
00:20:47,191 --> 00:20:48,430
Let's have a proper battle...

471
00:20:48,431 --> 00:20:49,901
between leaders.

472
00:20:51,361 --> 00:20:52,530
She won't come out.

473
00:20:52,531 --> 00:20:53,901
Rena would be enough.

474
00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:55,471
(Not you.)

475
00:20:56,141 --> 00:20:57,801
She's ignoring me.

476
00:20:58,241 --> 00:20:59,241
Let's go.

477
00:21:02,981 --> 00:21:04,081
I'll definitely win.

478
00:21:04,481 --> 00:21:06,611
You know you have to go

479
00:21:07,751 --> 00:21:09,021
There was a large difference in our levels.

480
00:21:09,921 --> 00:21:10,921
(Step back.)

481
00:21:15,221 --> 00:21:16,461
You have to see this.

482
00:21:18,021 --> 00:21:20,331
Rena! Show us, Rena!

483
00:21:23,561 --> 00:21:25,130
I will do anything to win.

484
00:21:25,131 --> 00:21:26,501
(Keep going, Ibuki.)

485
00:21:28,801 --> 00:21:29,871
I was on fire.

486
00:21:30,841 --> 00:21:31,841
Rena!

487
00:21:33,611 --> 00:21:34,611
(Amazing)

488
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,710
What are they doing?

489
00:21:37,711 --> 00:21:39,651
I thought maybe she had to rely on her crew.

490
00:21:43,281 --> 00:21:44,351
Rena!

491
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:51,831
Countdown! Five, four, three, two, one.

492
00:21:51,991 --> 00:21:54,130
Battle over!

493
00:21:54,131 --> 00:21:55,230
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

494
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:56,460
We're crazy.

495
00:21:56,461 --> 00:21:57,701
Let's go again. Rematch.

496
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:00,601
Goodness.

497
00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:02,501
(Exhaling)

498
00:22:02,701 --> 00:22:03,801
Rena.

499
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:05,911
They had the best teamwork.

500
00:22:06,311 --> 00:22:07,811
I love the crewwork.

501
00:22:08,341 --> 00:22:09,341
Nice.

502
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:12,180
OSAKA Ojo Gang had a really strong presence.

503
00:22:12,181 --> 00:22:13,281
Impactful.

504
00:22:14,581 --> 00:22:15,720
This...

505
00:22:15,721 --> 00:22:16,881
(How will it go?)

506
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:19,320
This one was a hard one, though, you guys.

507
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:21,420
You guys really showed up for Japan.

508
00:22:21,421 --> 00:22:22,890
Thank you for representing Japan.

509
00:22:22,891 --> 00:22:24,021
That was amazing.

510
00:22:24,661 --> 00:22:26,631
I thought we had definitely won.

511
00:22:26,931 --> 00:22:28,531
We wouldn't lose this.

512
00:22:29,361 --> 00:22:31,871
Sorry. First round was all Tokyo.

513
00:22:32,531 --> 00:22:33,831
Thank you so much.

514
00:22:35,001 --> 00:22:36,870
It's just, obviously, you guys come out popping.

515
00:22:36,871 --> 00:22:37,871
I'm going to be like...

516
00:22:37,872 --> 00:22:38,911
(Mike Song is excited.)

517
00:22:38,971 --> 00:22:42,480
But even still, it has the dynamic, so you guys found it.

518
00:22:42,481 --> 00:22:43,610
That moment right there.

519
00:22:43,611 --> 00:22:46,111
It's just like everyone in the room already knew, right?

520
00:22:47,181 --> 00:22:48,420
Second round Kyoka.

521
00:22:48,421 --> 00:22:49,580
(At the Simultaneous Battle)

522
00:22:49,581 --> 00:22:52,451
The song was all you.

523
00:22:52,921 --> 00:22:55,891
That was sensational.

524
00:22:56,761 --> 00:22:58,161
(Well done, our team.)

525
00:22:59,391 --> 00:23:01,391
He already said it.

526
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:03,531
Kyoka, that second round...

527
00:23:05,031 --> 00:23:07,870
That was just nasty.

528
00:23:07,871 --> 00:23:10,840
It's just such high skill,

529
00:23:10,841 --> 00:23:13,841
maturity, better in all the things. Killer.

530
00:23:14,011 --> 00:23:15,841
(That's Kyoka's class.)

531
00:23:16,181 --> 00:23:18,610
Third round was a little tricky.

532
00:23:18,611 --> 00:23:21,920
Ibuki, your talent regarding dance skills,

533
00:23:21,921 --> 00:23:25,120
I can't find somebody who can do waacking...

534
00:23:25,121 --> 00:23:27,691
better than you technique-wise.

535
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:29,991
Rena.

536
00:23:30,421 --> 00:23:31,931
You were having fun,

537
00:23:32,461 --> 00:23:35,900
but you were not as sharp as her.

538
00:23:35,901 --> 00:23:38,830
So there were some merits and demerits.

539
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:40,000
Let me think about it.

540
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,870
So the third round, for me,

541
00:23:41,871 --> 00:23:44,070
decided who wins.

542
00:23:44,071 --> 00:23:47,710
We will now check the result of the battle.

543
00:23:47,711 --> 00:23:49,610
Goodness.

544
00:23:49,611 --> 00:23:52,550
RHTokyo came here to represent Japan...

545
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:54,451
and win.

546
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:55,851
It's us, right?

547
00:23:56,421 --> 00:23:58,691
A pride as someone from Osaka.

548
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,790
We had to win.

549
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,221
Fight judge,

550
00:24:02,761 --> 00:24:04,861
card open.

551
00:24:08,361 --> 00:24:09,831
(OSAKA Ojo Gang 1: RHTokyo 1)

552
00:24:10,131 --> 00:24:12,671
I thought we won this battle.

553
00:24:13,031 --> 00:24:14,601
I thought we had won.

554
00:24:14,831 --> 00:24:17,001
(Which crew will win the Japan versus Japan battle?)

555
00:24:20,311 --> 00:24:23,011
(OSAKA Ojo Gang 1: RHTokyo 2)

556
00:24:23,381 --> 00:24:25,350
(RHTokyo won.)

557
00:24:25,351 --> 00:24:27,651
- Yes!
- Yes!

558
00:24:27,851 --> 00:24:29,421
It's so bad for the OSAKA Ojo Gang.

559
00:24:31,581 --> 00:24:33,921
(OSAKA Ojo Gang members look disappointed.)

560
00:24:34,191 --> 00:24:37,760
I think one group had more group moments

561
00:24:37,761 --> 00:24:39,990
We have to get those moments together.

562
00:24:39,991 --> 00:24:42,000
Once everyone is dancing together...

563
00:24:42,001 --> 00:24:44,000
on the right vibe, on the right energy,

564
00:24:44,001 --> 00:24:46,171
the right choreography, all of that,

565
00:24:46,371 --> 00:24:49,470
all of our eyes go to that one crew.

566
00:24:49,471 --> 00:24:50,541
Do you know what I'm saying?

567
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:52,470
Best teamwork.

568
00:24:52,471 --> 00:24:54,010
That's unity.

569
00:24:54,011 --> 00:24:56,610
They have been really unified,

570
00:24:56,611 --> 00:24:59,451
and they have a lot of moments when they come together.

571
00:24:59,781 --> 00:25:01,720
RHTokyo won.

572
00:25:01,721 --> 00:25:04,381
It was a battle between Tokyo and Osaka.

573
00:25:04,851 --> 00:25:06,090
We won the battle.

574
00:25:06,091 --> 00:25:08,790
It was the best moment.

575
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:10,191
It was really fun.

576
00:25:10,561 --> 00:25:11,661
I was very happy.

577
00:25:13,091 --> 00:25:14,361
(Exclaiming)

578
00:25:14,491 --> 00:25:16,601
Our routines didn't match on the first round.

579
00:25:17,301 --> 00:25:18,870
(Junna and Minami's teamwork wasn't good.)

580
00:25:18,871 --> 00:25:23,171
I was a bit upset about that.

581
00:25:23,341 --> 00:25:24,541
It's annoying.

582
00:25:25,241 --> 00:25:27,170
It was a battle between Osaka and Tokyo.

583
00:25:27,171 --> 00:25:29,011
So I was really upset.

584
00:25:29,411 --> 00:25:30,841
It starts from here.

585
00:25:32,651 --> 00:25:35,521
Relay Team Battle. The crew that will battle...

586
00:25:35,821 --> 00:25:38,181
is the crew that came in 6th place on the 1st round,

587
00:25:38,521 --> 00:25:41,151
Team Korea BUMSUP.

588
00:25:41,551 --> 00:25:43,090
Did they come last?

589
00:25:43,091 --> 00:25:45,191
Yes, but they also battled the most.

590
00:25:46,031 --> 00:25:48,430
(The crew was called out the most on the first round...)

591
00:25:48,431 --> 00:25:50,361
(and fought the most battles.)

592
00:25:50,531 --> 00:25:52,170
(But the result...)

593
00:25:52,171 --> 00:25:53,631
(They lost the most among the 6 crews.)

594
00:25:53,831 --> 00:25:55,571
(Team Korea has the worst results so far.)

595
00:25:55,771 --> 00:25:56,871
Let's go up!

596
00:25:57,301 --> 00:25:58,341
We can do it.

597
00:25:58,711 --> 00:26:01,410
We could seem like the easiest opponent now.

598
00:26:01,411 --> 00:26:02,581
We could pick BUMSUP.

599
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:04,581
Should we go with Korea?

600
00:26:05,011 --> 00:26:07,011
I think it's possible that many crews will go for Korea.

601
00:26:07,411 --> 00:26:09,380
It would really be bad if we lost.

602
00:26:09,381 --> 00:26:12,390
It was a battle that we had to win.

603
00:26:12,391 --> 00:26:15,120
The only thought I have now is that we should show them.

604
00:26:15,121 --> 00:26:16,121
(They have to prove themselves.)

605
00:26:16,261 --> 00:26:17,521
Well...

606
00:26:17,721 --> 00:26:20,331
The crew we'll call out...

607
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:22,861
is AG SQUAD.

608
00:26:23,161 --> 00:26:24,761
(AG SQUAD)

609
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:26,031
Yes!

610
00:26:27,371 --> 00:26:28,371
Yes.

611
00:26:29,071 --> 00:26:30,071
Did they laugh?

612
00:26:30,371 --> 00:26:31,641
They really liked it.

613
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:34,410
This is probably going to be an easy battle.

614
00:26:34,411 --> 00:26:37,080
Obviously, because BUMSUP was easy.

615
00:26:37,081 --> 00:26:39,580
Sixth, we did BUMSUP.

616
00:26:39,581 --> 00:26:41,850
- Underdog.
- Underdog, for sure.

617
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:43,080
- You should look at yourselves.
- They're funny.

618
00:26:43,081 --> 00:26:44,521
They'll be beaten up.

619
00:26:44,921 --> 00:26:46,291
(First round, Gabee and Danica)

620
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:48,120
(Easy)

621
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:49,191
(Get lost)

622
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,761
Get off!

623
00:26:51,021 --> 00:26:52,931
(Are we dancing?)

624
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:55,360
She was literally running around.

625
00:26:55,361 --> 00:26:56,961
(AG SQUAD criticized BUMSUP.)

626
00:26:57,561 --> 00:27:00,570
Our team members don't get looked down on by anyone.

627
00:27:00,571 --> 00:27:03,870
But they were attacking us so much.

628
00:27:03,871 --> 00:27:05,841
I thought I was the reason for that.

629
00:27:06,711 --> 00:27:08,781
(She bought the followers.)

630
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,681
(Doubting her ears)

631
00:27:10,841 --> 00:27:12,780
So I thought I should definitely win...

632
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:15,881
at the individual battle.

633
00:27:15,981 --> 00:27:17,651
(AG SQUAD 3: BUMSUP 0)

634
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:19,421
But we lost.

635
00:27:22,421 --> 00:27:24,590
I felt really bad.

636
00:27:24,591 --> 00:27:27,331
It felt like they were looking down on what she did.

637
00:27:28,161 --> 00:27:29,230
Goodness.

638
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:31,900
But I knew she was feeling upset the most,

639
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:33,201
and I felt really bad about that.

640
00:27:34,701 --> 00:27:35,770
It's okay.

641
00:27:35,771 --> 00:27:36,901
It's annoying.

642
00:27:37,801 --> 00:27:40,141
It's okay.

643
00:27:41,271 --> 00:27:42,541
Look at her.

644
00:27:42,811 --> 00:27:44,840
- What happened?
- She's crying.

645
00:27:44,841 --> 00:27:46,411
- Who's crying?
- Gabee.

646
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:48,651
She's crying. She's hiding.

647
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:51,381
- Don't cry.
- It's okay.

648
00:27:51,651 --> 00:27:52,791
- Don't cry.
- It's okay.

649
00:27:53,591 --> 00:27:55,020
I felt really sorry.

650
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:58,221
I think that's when I started to fall apart.

651
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,191
(Sighing)

652
00:28:02,301 --> 00:28:04,331
(BUMSUP is losing its spirit after the repeated defeats and attacks.)

653
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:07,900
When we look at it objectively,

654
00:28:07,901 --> 00:28:09,940
we have so many defeats.

655
00:28:09,941 --> 00:28:11,601
I don't think we can flip that.

656
00:28:12,011 --> 00:28:13,941
So I thought,

657
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:15,411
we should just get a return match.

658
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,011
Let's go with AG SQUAD.

659
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:19,211
- Aiki should go.
- Go, Aiki.

660
00:28:19,851 --> 00:28:21,111
Right. You should go.

661
00:28:21,311 --> 00:28:23,551
I do want to go.

662
00:28:23,881 --> 00:28:25,690
We shouldn't get scared...

663
00:28:25,691 --> 00:28:27,591
- by the words that call us weak.
- Right.

664
00:28:27,921 --> 00:28:28,921
Slay them.

665
00:28:30,021 --> 00:28:31,560
Right. Beat them.

666
00:28:31,561 --> 00:28:33,891
You judged us wrong.

667
00:28:35,031 --> 00:28:36,260
We wanted revenge.

668
00:28:36,261 --> 00:28:38,601
I should really go and bring back a win.

669
00:28:39,401 --> 00:28:40,730
- Are you guys ready?
- Let's go!

670
00:28:40,731 --> 00:28:41,870
- Let's go!
- Go!

671
00:28:41,871 --> 00:28:42,871
Fight!

672
00:28:42,872 --> 00:28:44,540
Let's become one and show them.

673
00:28:44,541 --> 00:28:45,811
And let's win.

674
00:28:50,941 --> 00:28:52,011
They have good teamwork.

675
00:28:53,551 --> 00:28:55,180
She became my security ball.

676
00:28:55,181 --> 00:28:56,751
Basketball!

677
00:28:57,221 --> 00:28:59,751
We'll show you something witty that only we can do.

678
00:29:01,221 --> 00:29:02,221
It was funny.

679
00:29:04,621 --> 00:29:05,660
Yes!

680
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:07,461
Let's go, Aiki!

681
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:10,901
(Look at that!)

682
00:29:12,171 --> 00:29:13,430
(Shoot)

683
00:29:13,431 --> 00:29:14,531
(Goal in!)

684
00:29:15,201 --> 00:29:17,141
The energy was all ours.

685
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:19,910
It was chill because I knew we could beat that.

686
00:29:19,911 --> 00:29:20,911
Let's go, girls.

687
00:29:21,111 --> 00:29:22,710
Vanessa and Danica.

688
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:24,581
They're magic tricks in your pocket.

689
00:29:24,941 --> 00:29:26,011
Bring it on.

690
00:29:26,351 --> 00:29:27,511
Heels duo.

691
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:29,651
That's cool.

692
00:29:29,652 --> 00:29:31,151
Okay!

693
00:29:33,591 --> 00:29:37,221
I can definitely beat them with dancing in heels.

694
00:29:39,031 --> 00:29:40,431
It's not that impressive.

695
00:29:40,831 --> 00:29:41,891
It's not that good.

696
00:29:43,131 --> 00:29:44,531
Shut up. Watch it.

697
00:29:46,831 --> 00:29:47,831
Okay.

698
00:29:51,071 --> 00:29:52,471
(How could they do that?)

699
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,811
- Did you see that?
- In a heel!

700
00:29:58,911 --> 00:30:01,310
Their dance wasn't that amazing.

701
00:30:01,311 --> 00:30:03,281
I believed we got a chance to win.

702
00:30:03,721 --> 00:30:06,150
(Fiery battle between two crews)

703
00:30:06,151 --> 00:30:08,591
The second round. AG SQUAD was killing it.

704
00:30:08,621 --> 00:30:10,390
(1-on-1 Simultaneous Battle, Alysha versus no:ze)

705
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,131
You were terrific at both dances.

706
00:30:12,361 --> 00:30:13,361
B-boying.

707
00:30:13,362 --> 00:30:14,431
(Breakdancing)

708
00:30:14,931 --> 00:30:16,330
(My friend!)

709
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:17,461
And the krumping.

710
00:30:18,461 --> 00:30:19,800
The Korean team in the second round...

711
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:22,470
wasn't as powerful as hers.

712
00:30:22,471 --> 00:30:25,511
You have to show me something that I didn't expect.

713
00:30:26,511 --> 00:30:28,470
And then the third battle,

714
00:30:28,471 --> 00:30:31,481
I don't think Danica was the right person to choose for that.

715
00:30:31,781 --> 00:30:33,810
(Battle in the 3rd round, Danica versus Lip J)

716
00:30:33,811 --> 00:30:36,221
Danica gives that a slow and sexy.

717
00:30:37,021 --> 00:30:38,450
And, for that song,

718
00:30:38,451 --> 00:30:39,820
that doesn't give a slow and sexy.

719
00:30:39,821 --> 00:30:41,791
That... You've got to go.

720
00:30:41,991 --> 00:30:44,161
Energy. Fast. Do you know what I'm saying?

721
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:47,161
So, I think Lip J can get it.

722
00:30:47,891 --> 00:30:49,430
(Powerful Lip J in a tutu)

723
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,561
The first round was really close.

724
00:30:51,861 --> 00:30:54,001
The Korean team was more creative.

725
00:30:54,331 --> 00:30:56,601
AG SQUAD, you guys were tight.

726
00:30:57,301 --> 00:30:58,810
Both had strong routines.

727
00:30:58,811 --> 00:31:00,440
I think one side...

728
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:04,011
just had a little bit more content that was thrown out.

729
00:31:04,341 --> 00:31:07,111
So, that's all I'm going to say for now.

730
00:31:07,681 --> 00:31:08,681
Thank you.

731
00:31:08,682 --> 00:31:11,221
(Both crews' fate depends on the outcome of the 1st round.)

732
00:31:12,591 --> 00:31:15,661
I wanted to win. I really hope...

733
00:31:15,761 --> 00:31:19,390
that my team doesn't look that weak...

734
00:31:19,391 --> 00:31:20,531
by winning this.

735
00:31:20,961 --> 00:31:22,800
I can tell that we're going to win.

736
00:31:22,801 --> 00:31:25,501
Because we don't have any other choice but to win.

737
00:31:26,631 --> 00:31:28,800
(Which crew will get the double-win?)

738
00:31:28,801 --> 00:31:30,540
Fight Judges,

739
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:32,441
open your cards.

740
00:31:33,011 --> 00:31:34,170
(I can't wait.)

741
00:31:34,171 --> 00:31:35,311
(What will be the result?)

742
00:31:37,411 --> 00:31:39,111
(Screaming)

743
00:31:39,651 --> 00:31:41,451
It's three to zero.

744
00:31:41,481 --> 00:31:44,220
Team Korea, BUMSUP, won.

745
00:31:44,221 --> 00:31:46,351
- You did a good job.
- Great job.

746
00:31:47,091 --> 00:31:49,561
I was so happy. I almost teared up.

747
00:31:50,221 --> 00:31:52,191
I felt like I was about to cry.

748
00:31:52,561 --> 00:31:55,131
I was so proud of them and so grateful.

749
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:58,261
Don't think we're easy, girls.

750
00:31:58,901 --> 00:32:01,531
- Two!
- Yes!

751
00:32:02,271 --> 00:32:03,500
Finally.

752
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:05,770
(The double thrill of the winner's chips)

753
00:32:05,771 --> 00:32:07,311
You're my favorite ball.

754
00:32:07,441 --> 00:32:09,441
- Thank you.
- We gave it all.

755
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,781
It was a really meaningful win.

756
00:32:13,081 --> 00:32:14,951
I wanted to keep pushing it this way.

757
00:32:15,881 --> 00:32:18,451
(AG SQUAD got the double loss to BUMSUP.)

758
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:22,960
I felt like our girls were about to fade.

759
00:32:22,961 --> 00:32:26,031
But it's not over. We can still win.

760
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:27,760
That's the last time we're losing.

761
00:32:27,761 --> 00:32:28,831
(This is the last time we're losing.)

762
00:32:29,001 --> 00:32:31,900
No Respect World Battle...

763
00:32:31,901 --> 00:32:33,631
is completed.

764
00:32:34,271 --> 00:32:36,341
For personal pride.

765
00:32:36,701 --> 00:32:38,600
For the honor of the crew.

766
00:32:38,601 --> 00:32:41,071
A fight fought with national pride on the line.

767
00:32:43,141 --> 00:32:46,450
It was No Respect World Battle.

768
00:32:46,451 --> 00:32:48,951
I'll announce the final results.

769
00:32:49,221 --> 00:32:51,621
The crew that has the most losses is the last.

770
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:55,351
The 3rd place. Total 1 win and 5 losses.

771
00:32:55,491 --> 00:32:58,491
Team Japan, OSAKA Ojo Gang.

772
00:32:58,691 --> 00:33:00,891
- Really?
- The third place?

773
00:33:02,031 --> 00:33:04,800
They have done numerous battles,

774
00:33:04,801 --> 00:33:06,470
but they didn't have luck in the WSWF.

775
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:07,901
We never know.

776
00:33:08,231 --> 00:33:11,900
I thought OSAKA Ojo Gang would dominate the battles, to be honest.

777
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:12,941
But...

778
00:33:13,211 --> 00:33:16,241
(The crew of strong battle dancers continued to lose.)

779
00:33:16,441 --> 00:33:18,541
(OSAKA Ojo Gang also lost to RHTokyo in the Team Japan battle.)

780
00:33:18,951 --> 00:33:20,081
Poor OSAKA Ojo Gang.

781
00:33:20,681 --> 00:33:22,951
They lost the whole time.

782
00:33:22,981 --> 00:33:27,091
The crew that has defeated OSAKA Ojo Gang the most is...

783
00:33:27,391 --> 00:33:29,290
RHTokyo.

784
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:30,660
This is serious.

785
00:33:30,661 --> 00:33:33,231
I'm mad. Of course, I'm so mad.

786
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:35,660
We ranked third as a result,

787
00:33:35,661 --> 00:33:38,900
but I don't think we've shown our full strength.

788
00:33:38,901 --> 00:33:42,240
All I'm thinking is we'll show it on the next mission.

789
00:33:42,241 --> 00:33:45,171
Next, they share fourth place.

790
00:33:45,711 --> 00:33:48,310
Total 4 wins and 6 losses.

791
00:33:48,311 --> 00:33:51,141
Team Australia, AG SQUAD.

792
00:33:51,341 --> 00:33:54,551
And, Team New Zealand, ROYAL FAMILY.

793
00:33:55,721 --> 00:33:56,821
They tied for fourth place.

794
00:33:57,281 --> 00:34:00,890
Teesha, Moana, and Kylie of ROYAL FAMILY won.

795
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:02,020
(ROYAL FAMILY proves to be a new generation, beating AG SQUAD.)

796
00:34:02,021 --> 00:34:05,160
The sixth place is Team Korea, BUMSUP.

797
00:34:05,161 --> 00:34:07,790
They ranked sixth.

798
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:08,830
(Team Korea finished in last place.)

799
00:34:08,831 --> 00:34:10,561
Look at BUMSUP.

800
00:34:11,401 --> 00:34:12,970
Team Korea got nine loser's chips.

801
00:34:12,971 --> 00:34:15,401
- That's fire.
- Crazy.

802
00:34:15,671 --> 00:34:18,140
They have experienced this and are incredible dancers.

803
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:20,070
So, I thought they'd be awesome,

804
00:34:20,071 --> 00:34:21,470
no matter what comes.

805
00:34:21,471 --> 00:34:23,140
I don't think they're that good at battles.

806
00:34:23,141 --> 00:34:24,641
Genuine respect.

807
00:34:24,741 --> 00:34:26,581
But I'm not scared of Team Korea.

808
00:34:27,681 --> 00:34:29,620
(Expected Winner, 4th place is BUMSUP.)

809
00:34:29,621 --> 00:34:30,920
We're in fourth place.

810
00:34:30,921 --> 00:34:33,750
It wouldn't be fun if we were in first place from the start.

811
00:34:33,751 --> 00:34:37,090
We'll go up from the bottom.

812
00:34:37,091 --> 00:34:38,221
(BUMSUP began with a strong will to reach the top.)

813
00:34:39,591 --> 00:34:41,790
I felt really bad.

814
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:44,561
It was not the time to give up, but I was so disappointed.

815
00:34:44,831 --> 00:34:48,130
I took it seriously and did my best.

816
00:34:48,131 --> 00:34:49,900
But WSWF is another level.

817
00:34:49,901 --> 00:34:51,141
I'm confused.

818
00:34:51,401 --> 00:34:53,470
I felt we were not good enough.

819
00:34:53,471 --> 00:34:55,781
I started to get really anxious.

820
00:34:55,811 --> 00:34:58,080
I think it shook me a lot.

821
00:34:58,081 --> 00:35:01,111
It was the reality we had to face.

822
00:35:01,581 --> 00:35:03,821
(BUMSUP is in shock at the unexpected results.)

823
00:35:04,121 --> 00:35:08,921
Finally, the first place in No Respect World Battle.

824
00:35:09,621 --> 00:35:11,691
(RHTokyo versus MOTIV Which one is in 1st place?)

825
00:35:11,961 --> 00:35:16,801
Total 9 wins and 2 losses. Team Japan, RHTokyo.

826
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,930
She's a choreographer.

827
00:35:18,931 --> 00:35:20,731
But she was better at battles than I expected.

828
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:21,970
(Let's keep it up.)

829
00:35:21,971 --> 00:35:23,741
They're the least losers.

830
00:35:25,571 --> 00:35:27,070
I didn't expect them to be in the first place.

831
00:35:27,071 --> 00:35:29,281
They're stronger than I thought.

832
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:31,880
Rie Hata and Reina of RHTokyo.

833
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:34,211
(Showing excellent individual skills from the first half)

834
00:35:35,181 --> 00:35:36,780
(Presenting outstanding teamwork in the second half)

835
00:35:36,781 --> 00:35:38,751
(RHTokyo continued a winning streak with a surprising rise.)

836
00:35:39,121 --> 00:35:40,591
(RHTokyo ranked in 1st place in No Respect World Battle.)

837
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,250
Did you see us?

838
00:35:42,251 --> 00:35:44,420
The teacher and students?

839
00:35:44,421 --> 00:35:46,660
So, what was wrong with that?

840
00:35:46,661 --> 00:35:47,960
Anyway, we won.

841
00:35:47,961 --> 00:35:49,600
We just had fun,

842
00:35:49,601 --> 00:35:50,831
but we won it all.

843
00:35:51,031 --> 00:35:52,300
(Rico Hirai won.)

844
00:35:52,301 --> 00:35:54,470
Without getting comfortable,

845
00:35:54,471 --> 00:35:56,271
we'll continue to work hard and do our best.

846
00:35:56,901 --> 00:35:59,171
The crew that is in second place is...

847
00:35:59,311 --> 00:36:00,740
MOTIV.

848
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,241
(Total 2 wins and 6 losses The 2nd place is MOTIV.)

849
00:36:02,811 --> 00:36:04,341
MOTIV is strong.

850
00:36:05,881 --> 00:36:07,080
(Showing the true essence of American hip-hop,)

851
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,480
(MOTIV covered everything from 1-on-1 Battles to Team Battle.)

852
00:36:08,481 --> 00:36:13,151
Won. Won. Won. Double-win.

853
00:36:13,591 --> 00:36:15,290
This is fun.

854
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:17,891
We'll be in first place at the end of the show.

855
00:36:18,261 --> 00:36:19,591
(Laughing)

856
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,561
We're in first place. Let's go in.

857
00:36:22,701 --> 00:36:25,931
(RHTokyo, the first place in No Respect World Battle)

858
00:36:26,171 --> 00:36:29,701
(RHTokyo's room)

859
00:36:30,701 --> 00:36:32,940
(Special gifts for RHTokyo to celebrate first place)

860
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:36,111
(Cake to celebrate the 1st place, cherries, and beers)

861
00:36:36,341 --> 00:36:37,410
Let's go.

862
00:36:37,411 --> 00:36:41,710
- Let's go. RHTokyo!
- Let's go. RHTokyo!

863
00:36:41,711 --> 00:36:43,250
(We're in 1st place.)

864
00:36:43,251 --> 00:36:44,880
She can drink.

865
00:36:44,881 --> 00:36:46,821
She can drink.

866
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:48,720
Cherries are so good.

867
00:36:48,721 --> 00:36:51,020
- How is it? Does it taste good?
- It's delicious.

868
00:36:51,021 --> 00:36:53,660
It's the 1st day, and we're in 1st place, so let's make 1.

869
00:36:53,661 --> 00:36:54,661
One, two.

870
00:36:55,491 --> 00:36:57,400
It was really the best result.

871
00:36:57,401 --> 00:36:58,601
How was that?

872
00:36:59,731 --> 00:37:01,901
We won with the team effort.

873
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:03,271
- It was a team effort.
- Indeed.

874
00:37:03,741 --> 00:37:06,370
I thought we'd win because we trust each other...

875
00:37:06,371 --> 00:37:08,141
and have strong teamwork.

876
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:11,380
We're a family.

877
00:37:11,381 --> 00:37:14,710
We have the strongest teamwork.

878
00:37:14,711 --> 00:37:16,021
Our bond wins.

879
00:37:17,451 --> 00:37:19,021
I wouldn't be able to do it alone.

880
00:37:19,151 --> 00:37:20,850
All of you had my back,

881
00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:23,661
so I could do this with confidence.

882
00:37:24,721 --> 00:37:25,990
(BUMSUP's room)

883
00:37:25,991 --> 00:37:27,031
It drives me crazy.

884
00:37:27,761 --> 00:37:29,460
It doesn't make sense.

885
00:37:29,461 --> 00:37:31,800
This is the worst result and humiliation.

886
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:33,671
(Frustrated)

887
00:37:34,131 --> 00:37:37,241
It was the reality we had to face.

888
00:37:37,341 --> 00:37:39,240
I totally...

889
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:42,511
broke down mentally.

890
00:37:43,241 --> 00:37:44,740
(When No Respect status was revealed)

891
00:37:44,741 --> 00:37:46,111
(Aiki was picked as No Respect the most.)

892
00:37:46,281 --> 00:37:49,681
(Shocked)

893
00:37:50,381 --> 00:37:51,751
I was really pissed.

894
00:37:53,591 --> 00:37:54,591
Aiki.

895
00:37:54,592 --> 00:37:56,660
TikTok is not always a real dance.

896
00:37:56,661 --> 00:37:58,760
- She bought her followers.
- She bought them.

897
00:37:58,761 --> 00:38:00,961
What? Did I buy followers?

898
00:38:01,961 --> 00:38:03,900
(Aiki lost to Aaliyah of AG SQUAD in the battle.)

899
00:38:03,901 --> 00:38:05,730
I hit the roof.

900
00:38:05,731 --> 00:38:07,870
I felt like I was being rejected.

901
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:10,001
I questioned whether my life had been in vain.

902
00:38:10,471 --> 00:38:14,641
I thought a lot about trying to get our performance in sync.

903
00:38:15,011 --> 00:38:17,880
Rie Hata's team moves in perfect sync.

904
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:19,250
They know what dance to do simply by looking at each other.

905
00:38:19,251 --> 00:38:21,311
They're literally a crew.

906
00:38:21,451 --> 00:38:23,980
We needed to show ourselves as a team.

907
00:38:23,981 --> 00:38:26,350
But I was disappointed it didn't go well.

908
00:38:26,351 --> 00:38:27,990
Since we all have our own style,

909
00:38:27,991 --> 00:38:30,620
it wasn't easy to integrate.

910
00:38:30,621 --> 00:38:32,991
I believe that was the reason we lost.

911
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:34,690
We all feel the same.

912
00:38:34,691 --> 00:38:37,330
We hurt our pride.

913
00:38:37,331 --> 00:38:38,731
We hurt our pride.

914
00:38:39,031 --> 00:38:41,800
We have to take it differently from season 1.

915
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:43,541
Yes, this is totally new.

916
00:38:43,671 --> 00:38:47,670
Anyway, we discovered our weaknesses today.

917
00:38:47,671 --> 00:38:50,440
We'll get in trouble if we get comfortable because we've done it.

918
00:38:50,441 --> 00:38:53,710
I need to keep in mind that I can't expect anything.

919
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:55,151
I should be better in the next mission.

920
00:38:55,611 --> 00:38:58,621
The first battle of World of Street Woman Fighter.

921
00:38:59,221 --> 00:39:00,721
Wait a minute.

922
00:39:00,891 --> 00:39:03,720
The first battle of World of Street Woman Fighter.

923
00:39:03,721 --> 00:39:06,891
No Respect World Battle is completed.

924
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:10,230
After the next mission, some will survive,

925
00:39:10,231 --> 00:39:14,331
while others will be closer to being eliminated.

926
00:39:14,401 --> 00:39:16,440
- That's not going to be us.
- Yes, we're good.

927
00:39:16,441 --> 00:39:19,871
The next mission will determine the fate of the nation.

928
00:39:20,011 --> 00:39:22,111
- Here comes the next mission.
- What is it?

929
00:39:22,441 --> 00:39:23,511
What is it?

930
00:39:23,941 --> 00:39:26,011
It's the signature of "Street Woman Fighter."

931
00:39:26,081 --> 00:39:28,680
Class Mission.

932
00:39:28,681 --> 00:39:30,620
Here we go.

933
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:32,720
That's an individual battle.

934
00:39:32,721 --> 00:39:34,050
You're all dead.

935
00:39:34,051 --> 00:39:35,191
I'll turn it into a revenge match.

936
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:37,420
We can't go down anymore.

937
00:39:37,421 --> 00:39:39,361
(Another crew with experience)

938
00:39:39,491 --> 00:39:40,761
It's the Class Mission.

939
00:39:41,091 --> 00:39:44,160
Finally, it's the Class Mission.

940
00:39:44,161 --> 00:39:45,560
Class Mission.

941
00:39:45,561 --> 00:39:47,501
- Class Mission.
- Class Mission.

942
00:39:48,171 --> 00:39:50,241
What is a Class Mission?

943
00:39:50,641 --> 00:39:52,671
The Class Mission on World of Street Woman Fighter...

944
00:39:52,771 --> 00:39:55,141
consists of three classes.

945
00:39:55,341 --> 00:39:56,341
Only three?

946
00:39:56,411 --> 00:39:57,411
What does that mean?

947
00:39:57,412 --> 00:39:58,981
That means three classes.

948
00:39:59,081 --> 00:40:02,180
The theme of this Class Mission is the number of people.

949
00:40:02,181 --> 00:40:03,280
The number of people?

950
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:04,621
Number of dancers?

951
00:40:04,881 --> 00:40:06,850
The leader class consists of one dancer.

952
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:09,421
(Leader class)

953
00:40:09,721 --> 00:40:12,261
For the rookie class, it's two dancers per crew.

954
00:40:12,361 --> 00:40:15,761
So a total of 12 dancers will complete a dance video.

955
00:40:16,001 --> 00:40:17,001
Two for the rookie class?

956
00:40:17,002 --> 00:40:18,301
(Yes)

957
00:40:18,401 --> 00:40:20,530
Oh, there are 12 dancers.

958
00:40:20,531 --> 00:40:22,901
For the middle class, it's four dancers per crew.

959
00:40:23,301 --> 00:40:26,571
A total of 24 dancers will complete the performance.

960
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:28,571
- Four times six is twenty-four.
- Oh, twenty-four.

961
00:40:29,071 --> 00:40:31,010
- Twenty-four?
- Yes.

962
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,310
- Oh, my gosh.
- That's actually not...

963
00:40:32,311 --> 00:40:33,381
a bad number though.

964
00:40:33,811 --> 00:40:35,881
There are good formations we can do with that.

965
00:40:35,981 --> 00:40:37,951
Oh, it's big like a mega crew.

966
00:40:38,051 --> 00:40:40,720
Each crew will be divided into three classes...

967
00:40:40,721 --> 00:40:43,260
and complete a dance video...

968
00:40:43,261 --> 00:40:45,491
reflecting your uniqueness and skills.

969
00:40:46,831 --> 00:40:49,161
One solo, two pairs? Like...

970
00:40:49,901 --> 00:40:50,901
Cool.

971
00:40:51,101 --> 00:40:53,930
- That's easy.
- We don't have weaker dancers.

972
00:40:53,931 --> 00:40:55,270
We got this one in the back.

973
00:40:55,271 --> 00:40:57,140
The crews will select the choreography...

974
00:40:57,141 --> 00:40:58,371
for each class first.

975
00:40:58,501 --> 00:41:00,870
Then they will face the Main Dancer Audition...

976
00:41:00,871 --> 00:41:03,511
to select the one that will pull off the choreography the best.

977
00:41:03,611 --> 00:41:06,611
Each of us is going to have to choreo, I think.

978
00:41:06,711 --> 00:41:08,711
And then they're going to choose the best choreo.

979
00:41:08,911 --> 00:41:12,791
To win, our choreography should be in that.

980
00:41:13,451 --> 00:41:15,150
We can kill this.

981
00:41:15,151 --> 00:41:17,960
The main dancer of each class gets to be in the center...

982
00:41:17,961 --> 00:41:19,361
of the dance video.

983
00:41:19,461 --> 00:41:22,490
They'll be in charge of the dance video as a director.

984
00:41:22,491 --> 00:41:24,400
They'll also be given 100 benefit points...

985
00:41:24,401 --> 00:41:27,131
and a chance to choose the worst dancer.

986
00:41:27,231 --> 00:41:29,070
It's important to become the main dancer.

987
00:41:29,071 --> 00:41:31,001
(Becoming the main dancer is the important part.)

988
00:41:31,141 --> 00:41:33,471
We have to be the main dancer at least for the benefit points.

989
00:41:33,641 --> 00:41:35,010
- Let me try.
- We must win it.

990
00:41:35,011 --> 00:41:37,580
One hundred benefit points? I know it from the experience.

991
00:41:37,581 --> 00:41:39,181
That means a lot.

992
00:41:39,281 --> 00:41:41,851
Everyone except the main dancers...

993
00:41:41,951 --> 00:41:44,721
will become the backup dancers.

994
00:41:44,821 --> 00:41:45,921
No.

995
00:41:46,491 --> 00:41:48,191
That never happened in my life before.

996
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:50,190
A backup dancer if I don't get selected?

997
00:41:50,191 --> 00:41:51,191
(Denying the reality)

998
00:41:51,421 --> 00:41:53,431
I have to become the backup dancer?

999
00:41:53,791 --> 00:41:56,161
Nothing's more humiliating than that.

1000
00:41:56,261 --> 00:41:58,861
They would hate me to be a backup dancer.

1001
00:41:58,961 --> 00:42:00,700
I don't listen to the main dancer.

1002
00:42:00,701 --> 00:42:02,470
I know. Imagine being one.

1003
00:42:02,471 --> 00:42:04,000
(Imagining)

1004
00:42:04,001 --> 00:42:05,801
No.

1005
00:42:05,971 --> 00:42:08,370
I love being the star in music videos.

1006
00:42:08,371 --> 00:42:10,241
I don't like being a backup dancer.

1007
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,441
So I just need to bring it.

1008
00:42:13,081 --> 00:42:16,451
We'll now reveal the mission song for each class.

1009
00:42:17,621 --> 00:42:19,150
That's crazy.

1010
00:42:19,151 --> 00:42:21,051
This is really important. Please. I'm begging you.

1011
00:42:21,191 --> 00:42:23,021
Let's give it a nice listen.

1012
00:42:24,991 --> 00:42:27,531
The rookie class song reveal. Okay.

1013
00:42:27,661 --> 00:42:29,231
Rookie.

1014
00:42:29,531 --> 00:42:30,531
Hello.

1015
00:42:30,801 --> 00:42:32,101
(Who's that?)

1016
00:42:32,331 --> 00:42:35,630
Hello, World of Street Woman Fighter Class Mission.

1017
00:42:35,631 --> 00:42:38,801
I'm Gummy. I'll be singing for the rookie class.

1018
00:42:38,971 --> 00:42:41,571
I'm SINCE. I'll be singing for the rookie class.

1019
00:42:42,171 --> 00:42:44,880
The song I'll be singing is produced by...

1020
00:42:44,881 --> 00:42:46,351
Padi, the producer of "Smoke."

1021
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,750
- Oh, my.
- The rookie class mission song...

1022
00:42:48,751 --> 00:42:49,950
we sang...

1023
00:42:49,951 --> 00:42:51,221
We'll play it now.

1024
00:42:51,421 --> 00:42:52,421
Come on.

1025
00:42:52,422 --> 00:42:53,690
("Flip Flop" by Gummy and SINCE)

1026
00:42:53,691 --> 00:42:56,720
(An Afrobeat song with a sentimental acoustic guitar sound...)

1027
00:42:56,721 --> 00:42:59,890
(on top of a rhythmical percussion sound)

1028
00:42:59,891 --> 00:43:00,961
It's a good song.

1029
00:43:01,361 --> 00:43:03,561
It matches the way I dance.

1030
00:43:03,901 --> 00:43:04,901
It's worth trying.

1031
00:43:05,031 --> 00:43:06,101
That suits me.

1032
00:43:07,101 --> 00:43:10,141
I'll be able to show what I'm good at.

1033
00:43:11,401 --> 00:43:13,011
That's not for me.

1034
00:43:13,741 --> 00:43:14,811
That's not my style.

1035
00:43:15,211 --> 00:43:16,981
It sounds more like ROYAL FAMILY's style.

1036
00:43:17,611 --> 00:43:19,851
We got lucky with this one.

1037
00:43:20,611 --> 00:43:22,351
This is a good fit for me.

1038
00:43:22,581 --> 00:43:25,321
Come on, "Flip Flop!" "Flip Flop."

1039
00:43:26,321 --> 00:43:27,591
I felt really confident.

1040
00:43:28,021 --> 00:43:29,391
(Meanwhile, the good students AG SQUAD is writing it down.)

1041
00:43:29,491 --> 00:43:31,620
So we finally got to listen to the song.

1042
00:43:31,621 --> 00:43:33,931
And so excited.

1043
00:43:34,091 --> 00:43:35,561
It was so good.

1044
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:38,431
Hitting a little dance, you know?

1045
00:43:39,471 --> 00:43:42,031
It feels like the Afro genre.

1046
00:43:42,231 --> 00:43:44,471
The one who danced the Afro would do this.

1047
00:43:44,541 --> 00:43:45,701
(Is it the next song?)

1048
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:47,370
- Hello, dancers.
- Hello, dancers.

1049
00:43:47,371 --> 00:43:50,340
We made the song "Ridin'" for the middle class Class Mission.

1050
00:43:50,341 --> 00:43:52,950
We're the middle class song singers. I'm LILY of NMIXX.

1051
00:43:52,951 --> 00:43:54,780
- I'm JIWOO.
- I'm KYUJIN.

1052
00:43:54,781 --> 00:43:55,781
It's the middle class.

1053
00:43:56,281 --> 00:43:58,220
Oh, it's going to be good.

1054
00:43:58,221 --> 00:44:00,420
So which crew of which country...

1055
00:44:00,421 --> 00:44:03,260
will win the title of the main dancer?

1056
00:44:03,261 --> 00:44:06,560
The middle class Class Mission song we sang, "Ridin'."

1057
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:07,590
We'll play it now.

1058
00:44:07,591 --> 00:44:08,591
("Ridin'" by LILY, JIWOO, and KYUJIN)

1059
00:44:08,592 --> 00:44:09,600
(The pop song with overwhelming 808 bass...)

1060
00:44:09,601 --> 00:44:10,601
(on top of the grand brass)

1061
00:44:11,061 --> 00:44:12,661
Oh, girlish.

1062
00:44:12,761 --> 00:44:14,201
It's a feminine song.

1063
00:44:14,431 --> 00:44:17,641
I'm pretty dark.

1064
00:44:18,201 --> 00:44:21,811
So it's not something I can dance to right now.

1065
00:44:22,071 --> 00:44:24,740
When I was in Kyoka's stance, the only time I got up...

1066
00:44:24,741 --> 00:44:26,481
In the thing where like...

1067
00:44:27,181 --> 00:44:28,210
That's it.

1068
00:44:28,211 --> 00:44:30,681
I actually think this song was perfect for us.

1069
00:44:30,781 --> 00:44:32,321
- That's cool.
- I love this song.

1070
00:44:32,521 --> 00:44:35,050
(Singing automatically)

1071
00:44:35,051 --> 00:44:37,091
It's cool. This is my forte.

1072
00:44:37,561 --> 00:44:40,061
It's the melody that Leejung likes.

1073
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:43,260
I was dancing like this thinking Leejung. It suits her.

1074
00:44:43,261 --> 00:44:44,261
What do you think?

1075
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,701
- After listening to the song.
- I like it.

1076
00:44:45,801 --> 00:44:48,671
This mission was made for me, and so was this song.

1077
00:44:48,871 --> 00:44:51,271
I don't care who competes me. This is mine.

1078
00:44:52,741 --> 00:44:53,871
Come on, leader.

1079
00:44:54,171 --> 00:44:57,011
Let's go, Teesha.

1080
00:44:57,641 --> 00:44:59,780
I'm excited to hear what your song's going to be.

1081
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:00,781
Yes.

1082
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:01,980
Hello, leader class.

1083
00:45:01,981 --> 00:45:03,250
(Everyone's surprised.)

1084
00:45:03,251 --> 00:45:04,581
(Who's the artist for the leader class song?)

1085
00:45:06,321 --> 00:45:07,390
(Surprised)

1086
00:45:07,391 --> 00:45:09,521
I'm WOOZI of SEVENTEEN, the producer of the leader class song.

1087
00:45:10,521 --> 00:45:12,491
It's WOOZI? Oh, WOOZI.

1088
00:45:12,861 --> 00:45:13,931
SEVENTEEN?

1089
00:45:14,231 --> 00:45:15,760
SEVENTEEN is a big K-pop group.

1090
00:45:15,761 --> 00:45:18,961
The song I produced is "ECHO!"

1091
00:45:19,161 --> 00:45:20,271
Hip-hop?

1092
00:45:20,701 --> 00:45:21,830
Anything but hip-hop.

1093
00:45:21,831 --> 00:45:23,000
(Please.)

1094
00:45:23,001 --> 00:45:26,141
I'll now play the leader class mission song.

1095
00:45:26,711 --> 00:45:27,740
(Concentrating)

1096
00:45:27,741 --> 00:45:28,810
("ECHO!" by HOSHI and WOOZI)

1097
00:45:28,811 --> 00:45:30,080
(An impressive trap song with an addictive synth riff...)

1098
00:45:30,081 --> 00:45:31,540
(and a minimal yet intense beat)

1099
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:33,580
(Everyone's excited in this room.)

1100
00:45:33,581 --> 00:45:36,921
You're going to eat this one. Just eat it!

1101
00:45:37,581 --> 00:45:39,420
- Yes.
- Eat it up.

1102
00:45:39,421 --> 00:45:40,421
(Trying to focus)

1103
00:45:40,422 --> 00:45:42,091
(Listening carefully)

1104
00:45:42,551 --> 00:45:43,690
(Groaning)

1105
00:45:43,691 --> 00:45:47,260
- I don't have any experience...
- Goodnight.

1106
00:45:47,261 --> 00:45:49,461
choreographing a hip-hop song.

1107
00:45:49,661 --> 00:45:51,061
Can we change the leader?

1108
00:45:52,861 --> 00:45:54,371
This is made for Rie.

1109
00:45:54,871 --> 00:45:58,270
It's overwhelmingly for Rie.

1110
00:45:58,271 --> 00:46:00,271
This is already over.

1111
00:46:00,811 --> 00:46:01,811
(Screaming in happiness)

1112
00:46:01,941 --> 00:46:04,780
This is the song I'm good at.

1113
00:46:04,781 --> 00:46:05,811
I was happy.

1114
00:46:06,011 --> 00:46:08,281
It kind of reminds me of Rie Hata.

1115
00:46:08,381 --> 00:46:11,480
Not every choreography in the world isn't Rie Hata's style.

1116
00:46:11,481 --> 00:46:13,491
- Don't let that discourage you.
- She's right.

1117
00:46:13,691 --> 00:46:14,951
You know you can do it.

1118
00:46:15,051 --> 00:46:18,861
I'll still come up with one.

1119
00:46:18,961 --> 00:46:20,461
It's worth trying.

1120
00:46:20,731 --> 00:46:23,400
I feel like I can be the main dancer...

1121
00:46:23,401 --> 00:46:24,600
in my leader's class.

1122
00:46:24,601 --> 00:46:26,301
Age is just a number.

1123
00:46:26,501 --> 00:46:29,331
I just need to win it and be the best.

1124
00:46:29,431 --> 00:46:31,401
You can do all their choreography.

1125
00:46:31,501 --> 00:46:32,800
I can do everything.

1126
00:46:32,801 --> 00:46:35,610
I think people might not think I'll be able to choreograph...

1127
00:46:35,611 --> 00:46:36,841
to K-pop music.

1128
00:46:37,081 --> 00:46:39,081
But I'm also excited to showcase that I can.

1129
00:46:39,481 --> 00:46:42,411
(Time for 6 crew leaders to decide the lineup for each class)

1130
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:44,851
Rena has the Class Mission experience.

1131
00:46:45,051 --> 00:46:46,721
She'll be very helpful.

1132
00:46:47,021 --> 00:46:51,520
Ruu is an important assistant who newly joined the team.

1133
00:46:51,521 --> 00:46:54,060
I think she'll start a new fad.

1134
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,030
I think it'll be really fun to see what they do.

1135
00:46:56,031 --> 00:46:58,360
I have faith in these two girls.

1136
00:46:58,361 --> 00:47:00,871
AG SQUAD will be the main dancers for all three.

1137
00:47:01,071 --> 00:47:03,241
(Meanwhile, Honey J's contemplating.)

1138
00:47:03,701 --> 00:47:05,001
It's never easy.

1139
00:47:06,071 --> 00:47:07,771
Two rookies and four middle classes.

1140
00:47:07,871 --> 00:47:10,241
She can't do it, and she can't do it either.

1141
00:47:10,641 --> 00:47:12,880
Ri.hey can't participate,

1142
00:47:12,881 --> 00:47:14,711
and Gabee's knee is also injured.

1143
00:47:14,811 --> 00:47:18,081
So we're short of dancers.

1144
00:47:18,321 --> 00:47:20,320
Then it's better for me to pair up with Lip J.

1145
00:47:20,321 --> 00:47:22,590
Hyojin Choi was nice enough...

1146
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:23,991
to volunteer for both.

1147
00:47:25,061 --> 00:47:26,221
We'll have to do our best.

1148
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:31,861
(With BUMSUP being the last to complete the lineup,)

1149
00:47:32,961 --> 00:47:34,970
(all 6 crews decided the lineup for each class.)

1150
00:47:34,971 --> 00:47:36,971
What you have to do now is...

1151
00:47:37,071 --> 00:47:41,211
to create a choreography for 30 seconds to be the main dancer.

1152
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:44,581
You'll be given a chance to appeal your 30-second choreography.

1153
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:46,811
And only one choreography will be chosen.

1154
00:47:46,911 --> 00:47:50,781
Everyone. How many times did we lose this time?

1155
00:47:50,881 --> 00:47:52,421
Let's pay them back.

1156
00:47:53,721 --> 00:47:54,921
Let's return it to them.

1157
00:47:55,021 --> 00:47:57,821
Everyone covers different genres and has different styles.

1158
00:47:58,091 --> 00:47:59,990
But we can't do that anymore.

1159
00:47:59,991 --> 00:48:01,861
We're a team now.

1160
00:48:02,061 --> 00:48:05,000
I wish our choreography's chosen with this lineup...

1161
00:48:05,001 --> 00:48:06,671
and for us to become the main dancers.

1162
00:48:07,001 --> 00:48:09,001
Guys, are you ready for this Class Mission?

1163
00:48:09,071 --> 00:48:11,670
- Yes. Let's go.
- Yes.

1164
00:48:11,671 --> 00:48:14,770
(Ready for the Class Mission)

1165
00:48:14,771 --> 00:48:16,840
(The Class Mission draws near.)

1166
00:48:16,841 --> 00:48:19,081
(Which crew will be laughing at the end?)

1167
00:48:21,351 --> 00:48:22,611
The rookie class choreography?

1168
00:48:22,811 --> 00:48:25,581
I wish our choreography is chosen.

1169
00:48:25,681 --> 00:48:27,221
No. They're going to choose us.

1170
00:48:27,421 --> 00:48:29,761
I'll be happy to show the chemistry that we have.

1171
00:48:29,921 --> 00:48:32,021
Strongest? It's me and Aaliyah.

1172
00:48:32,361 --> 00:48:34,390
Middle Class? I think we will be picked.

1173
00:48:34,391 --> 00:48:37,100
We are ROYAL FAMILY. This is going to be easy.

1174
00:48:37,101 --> 00:48:39,430
Pick a dance that makes sense. Like MOTIV crew.

1175
00:48:39,431 --> 00:48:42,031
My choreography will shine.

1176
00:48:42,471 --> 00:48:44,070
This is what I do.

1177
00:48:44,071 --> 00:48:45,771
I don't have a rival.

1178
00:48:46,001 --> 00:48:48,570
I'll show people that Ibuki the Battler can do this too.

1179
00:48:48,571 --> 00:48:50,781
I wish this choreography was picked.

1180
00:48:50,881 --> 00:48:53,981
As a leader, I don't like being a backup dancer.

1181
00:48:54,881 --> 00:48:57,021
(They choreograph until late at night.)

1182
00:48:57,321 --> 00:48:59,481
(Whose choreography will be picked for each class?)

1183
00:48:59,681 --> 00:49:00,990
(Choreography Selection D-Day)

1184
00:49:00,991 --> 00:49:02,151
Hi.

1185
00:49:02,951 --> 00:49:03,990
Did you sleep well?

1186
00:49:03,991 --> 00:49:04,991
(All 6 crews arrive.)

1187
00:49:05,821 --> 00:49:07,091
(Kyra is sleeping.)

1188
00:49:07,331 --> 00:49:09,760
We just wanted to show everyone...

1189
00:49:09,761 --> 00:49:12,361
how hard we had worked over the night.

1190
00:49:12,631 --> 00:49:16,030
I'm excited for everyone to see us actually do choreography.

1191
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,740
- Yes.
- As that's our strength.

1192
00:49:17,741 --> 00:49:19,570
Oh, middle class.

1193
00:49:19,571 --> 00:49:21,240
- ROYAL FAMILY.
- I think they'll...

1194
00:49:21,241 --> 00:49:22,271
Oh, I don't know.

1195
00:49:22,341 --> 00:49:24,581
Busy, busy, busy textures.

1196
00:49:24,611 --> 00:49:26,010
You know what they're going to bring.

1197
00:49:26,011 --> 00:49:27,550
No one will pick it if she does.

1198
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,650
- But you guys got it.
- Yes.

1199
00:49:28,651 --> 00:49:31,580
You guys' routine is so strong. It's memorable, and yes.

1200
00:49:31,581 --> 00:49:32,880
AG SQUAD.

1201
00:49:32,881 --> 00:49:34,351
We already won.

1202
00:49:34,951 --> 00:49:38,890
It will be interesting to see the similarities...

1203
00:49:38,891 --> 00:49:40,990
and the differences between ours and theirs.

1204
00:49:40,991 --> 00:49:44,600
It will be cool for us to show them our choreography.

1205
00:49:44,601 --> 00:49:47,500
Then we have a really good chance in showing something...

1206
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:48,631
fresh and new.

1207
00:49:49,271 --> 00:49:51,640
AG SQUAD should win against ROYAL FAMILY.

1208
00:49:51,641 --> 00:49:53,000
And that's how it should be.

1209
00:49:53,001 --> 00:49:56,170
We always have a signature move. It's always memorable, as well.

1210
00:49:56,171 --> 00:49:58,340
RF-style.

1211
00:49:58,341 --> 00:50:00,180
I'm curious about Ibuki.

1212
00:50:00,181 --> 00:50:01,910
I haven't seen Kyoka dance...

1213
00:50:01,911 --> 00:50:03,080
- to this kind of music before.
- Me neither.

1214
00:50:03,081 --> 00:50:04,450
- It's kind of...
- I can't imagine how it will be.

1215
00:50:04,451 --> 00:50:05,550
I'm so curious to see...

1216
00:50:05,551 --> 00:50:07,820
how someone who's so good at battling...

1217
00:50:07,821 --> 00:50:10,760
will create choreography.

1218
00:50:10,761 --> 00:50:13,890
Me and Kyoka have such a strong image as dance battlers,

1219
00:50:13,891 --> 00:50:17,030
so we have to be 100 times better for this mission.

1220
00:50:17,031 --> 00:50:19,730
If not, they'll all think we don't know what we're doing.

1221
00:50:19,731 --> 00:50:22,470
The idea that dance battlers can't make good choreography.

1222
00:50:22,471 --> 00:50:24,440
I want to show through my choreography...

1223
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:27,071
the fact that I'm a dancer that can do both.

1224
00:50:27,371 --> 00:50:29,840
People tend to think that I only do freestyle.

1225
00:50:29,841 --> 00:50:31,840
But I've actually created a lot of choreography,

1226
00:50:31,841 --> 00:50:34,450
and this choreography was made with trust toward the other three.

1227
00:50:34,451 --> 00:50:37,220
As long as we can match well,

1228
00:50:37,221 --> 00:50:40,190
we're able to come up with a very strong choreography.

1229
00:50:40,191 --> 00:50:41,850
I have faith in my crew members.

1230
00:50:41,851 --> 00:50:43,890
Once we finished making our choreography,

1231
00:50:43,891 --> 00:50:45,961
we felt nothing but confidence, to be honest.

1232
00:50:46,091 --> 00:50:47,630
And I don't know...

1233
00:50:47,631 --> 00:50:49,431
because we haven't seen them really choreograph much, yet.

1234
00:50:49,561 --> 00:50:52,901
(The rookie class)

1235
00:50:53,531 --> 00:50:54,601
We're first?

1236
00:50:54,701 --> 00:50:55,971
We can practice.

1237
00:50:58,701 --> 00:50:59,801
Hey.

1238
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,640
We didn't go full-out...

1239
00:51:02,641 --> 00:51:05,280
because we didn't want anybody to see that.

1240
00:51:05,281 --> 00:51:07,050
People are playing their cards,

1241
00:51:07,051 --> 00:51:09,711
and they're being smart about the decisions that they're making.

1242
00:51:11,351 --> 00:51:12,351
One more time?

1243
00:51:12,751 --> 00:51:14,691
Should we move this way?

1244
00:51:15,991 --> 00:51:17,291
(Like this?)

1245
00:51:17,591 --> 00:51:19,420
There was a lot of tension in the air.

1246
00:51:19,421 --> 00:51:21,960
Whenever someone would walk by, they would make unclear movements...

1247
00:51:21,961 --> 00:51:23,090
to prevent them from seeing the choreography.

1248
00:51:23,091 --> 00:51:24,560
If you take a look at the lineup,

1249
00:51:24,561 --> 00:51:26,031
they're actually not rookies.

1250
00:51:26,201 --> 00:51:28,301
- The rookies.
- They're scary.

1251
00:51:28,671 --> 00:51:30,300
- Real rookies...
- are non-existent.

1252
00:51:30,301 --> 00:51:32,640
They're just the strongest duos.

1253
00:51:32,641 --> 00:51:35,170
I think they'll all be making completely different choreographies.

1254
00:51:35,171 --> 00:51:36,240
I agree.

1255
00:51:36,241 --> 00:51:37,781
None of the rookies have similar styles.

1256
00:51:38,411 --> 00:51:40,580
Reina and Rico.

1257
00:51:40,581 --> 00:51:44,820
Reina. She's done a couple of choreography for a couple of groups.

1258
00:51:44,821 --> 00:51:46,820
Those two are good.

1259
00:51:46,821 --> 00:51:48,990
Heel choreography and afro.

1260
00:51:48,991 --> 00:51:50,890
Lip J is among the rookie class.

1261
00:51:50,891 --> 00:51:53,560
I wonder if she'll still keep the waacking.

1262
00:51:53,561 --> 00:51:55,690
What about Abby and Kaidi?

1263
00:51:55,691 --> 00:51:58,030
I feel like it'll be very hip-hop.

1264
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:01,530
All these pairings are just really strong.

1265
00:52:01,531 --> 00:52:04,371
The rookie category is all about chemistry.

1266
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:08,170
- Chemistry.
- You guys' chemistry is so good.

1267
00:52:08,171 --> 00:52:09,171
(Vanessa, Aaliyah, you guys' chemistry is so good.)

1268
00:52:09,471 --> 00:52:11,781
- Let's show them.
- Yes.

1269
00:52:12,241 --> 00:52:14,681
We got it. Easy. Nothing.

1270
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:16,681
I know it. We can kill that.

1271
00:52:17,921 --> 00:52:19,850
ROYAL FAMILY is up.

1272
00:52:19,851 --> 00:52:21,851
I think ROYAL FAMILY will stick to their style.

1273
00:52:22,051 --> 00:52:24,491
Maiya and Kylie?

1274
00:52:25,091 --> 00:52:26,930
They'll be like...

1275
00:52:26,931 --> 00:52:28,430
(Like this)

1276
00:52:28,431 --> 00:52:30,061
- Dance like they're performing.
- So much energy.

1277
00:52:30,531 --> 00:52:34,531
ROYAL FAMILY is ROYAL FAMILY.

1278
00:52:35,931 --> 00:52:39,440
We're very focusing on putting our own flavor...

1279
00:52:39,441 --> 00:52:41,741
into each movement.

1280
00:52:46,081 --> 00:52:48,211
I've seen the choreography before.

1281
00:52:51,521 --> 00:52:53,890
It was just them on a stage.

1282
00:52:53,891 --> 00:52:55,891
Like the videos that were shown of them.

1283
00:52:58,791 --> 00:53:00,931
It was just so them.

1284
00:53:02,091 --> 00:53:05,160
ROYAL FAMILY. They also used...

1285
00:53:05,161 --> 00:53:07,701
more choreo from previous...

1286
00:53:08,801 --> 00:53:12,071
(Auckland Lantern Festival 2025)

1287
00:53:12,841 --> 00:53:15,741
(They're exactly the same.)

1288
00:53:15,841 --> 00:53:18,811
It was quite clear on who stuck to their brand...

1289
00:53:19,911 --> 00:53:24,320
and who didn't think about how we can utilize other styles.

1290
00:53:24,321 --> 00:53:25,821
They copied that.

1291
00:53:26,951 --> 00:53:28,321
It's just annoying.

1292
00:53:28,751 --> 00:53:30,491
You all are just being haters now.

1293
00:53:32,191 --> 00:53:33,361
AG SQUAD.

1294
00:53:34,031 --> 00:53:37,800
Her sensual movements are one of her biggest strengths.

1295
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:39,901
I was curious to see what kind of choreography she came up with.

1296
00:53:40,671 --> 00:53:43,231
Because our choreo is complex. It's too hard.

1297
00:53:43,671 --> 00:53:46,301
If they don't choose us, they didn't want a challenge.

1298
00:53:46,911 --> 00:53:49,541
Since this is a choreography challenge,

1299
00:53:49,941 --> 00:53:54,851
we wanted to keep it choreography challenge.

1300
00:53:55,251 --> 00:53:57,151
I see. Interesting.

1301
00:53:57,751 --> 00:53:59,421
Usually, a choreography isn't chosen if it's too hard.

1302
00:53:59,721 --> 00:54:00,721
They're provoking us.

1303
00:54:01,391 --> 00:54:04,561
Vanessa and I definitely have a good chance.

1304
00:54:04,861 --> 00:54:06,461
- They're starting on the floor.
- Yes.

1305
00:54:13,161 --> 00:54:15,871
(Perfectly in sync)

1306
00:54:19,401 --> 00:54:21,471
I thought their choreography was difficult.

1307
00:54:22,641 --> 00:54:25,541
It felt like they incorporated too many techniques.

1308
00:54:25,981 --> 00:54:29,681
For this challenge, I thought it was too complicated.

1309
00:54:33,751 --> 00:54:35,791
It was just too technical.

1310
00:54:35,951 --> 00:54:36,960
Just too hard.

1311
00:54:36,961 --> 00:54:38,161
The dance is...

1312
00:54:38,391 --> 00:54:40,861
- Literally just... Yes.
- Did they even listen to the music?

1313
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:44,560
Memorizing choreo in a short period of time...

1314
00:54:44,561 --> 00:54:46,460
will be difficult.

1315
00:54:46,461 --> 00:54:50,441
Be more confident with yourselves.

1316
00:54:51,171 --> 00:54:52,601
(Laughing)

1317
00:54:53,941 --> 00:54:54,941
Whatever.

1318
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,810
We won't be able to do it as good as them.

1319
00:54:56,811 --> 00:54:58,541
- We have to win.
- Yes.

1320
00:54:58,841 --> 00:55:00,581
(Next up is MOTIV's Kaidi and Abby.)

1321
00:55:03,011 --> 00:55:06,551
We wanted to make it apparent that the beginning is hip-hop.

1322
00:55:07,421 --> 00:55:11,860
They used hip-hop elements to express "Flip Flop" in various ways.

1323
00:55:11,861 --> 00:55:12,891
But I don't like it.

1324
00:55:17,101 --> 00:55:19,301
If we're thinking about K-pop, not a vibe.

1325
00:55:22,071 --> 00:55:24,570
There's no chemistry.

1326
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,240
There didn't have to be two people for this.

1327
00:55:26,241 --> 00:55:27,571
She could have just done this on her own.

1328
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:31,381
(The next crew is OSAKA Ojo Gang. Junna and Uwa.)

1329
00:55:32,011 --> 00:55:35,811
We created a memorable choreography, so it's easy to memorize.

1330
00:55:41,091 --> 00:55:42,691
(Thinking)

1331
00:55:47,861 --> 00:55:50,731
It was adorable, and I loved their energy.

1332
00:55:53,631 --> 00:55:54,631
(Seamless teamwork)

1333
00:55:54,632 --> 00:55:57,371
I think they've got great chemistry,

1334
00:55:57,741 --> 00:55:59,701
but I'm not sure what their point move was.

1335
00:55:59,841 --> 00:56:03,411
I feel like we could do every single one of them.

1336
00:56:04,781 --> 00:56:06,281
I don't want this one.

1337
00:56:07,351 --> 00:56:10,781
The part where you used the zip-up hoodie was the most memorable.

1338
00:56:10,921 --> 00:56:12,951
That was amazing.

1339
00:56:13,721 --> 00:56:16,990
But to point out a flaw,

1340
00:56:16,991 --> 00:56:20,460
the part with the zip-up hoodie was a bit short.

1341
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:22,291
If you had shown us more of that,

1342
00:56:22,691 --> 00:56:25,600
it would have been even more amazing.

1343
00:56:25,601 --> 00:56:27,231
I guess that's fair.

1344
00:56:27,871 --> 00:56:30,071
(Up next is RHTokyo's Reina and Rico Hirai.)

1345
00:56:31,141 --> 00:56:33,810
RHTokyo were the ones I was watching out for.

1346
00:56:33,811 --> 00:56:35,710
I think RHTokyo.

1347
00:56:35,711 --> 00:56:37,341
RHTokyo.

1348
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:39,241
When it comes to experience in choreography,

1349
00:56:39,641 --> 00:56:41,511
RHTokyo has the strongest background.

1350
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:46,551
(Reina has garnered attention with her trendy K-pop choreographies.)

1351
00:56:47,751 --> 00:56:49,890
I have experience in creating choreography.

1352
00:56:49,891 --> 00:56:51,791
I'm confident that ours will be chosen.

1353
00:56:53,861 --> 00:56:56,761
We made choreography that anyone would want to try.

1354
00:57:01,601 --> 00:57:03,071
It was cute, it wasn't too hard.

1355
00:57:04,001 --> 00:57:05,371
(Let's go!)

1356
00:57:09,441 --> 00:57:10,781
Same thing. Literally.

1357
00:57:12,311 --> 00:57:13,851
Their execution was great.

1358
00:57:15,851 --> 00:57:17,851
They kept it controlled...

1359
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:20,291
but made it so that anyone would want to try.

1360
00:57:28,091 --> 00:57:30,730
It was very powerful. You know what I mean?

1361
00:57:30,731 --> 00:57:32,661
Even if it was simple moves.

1362
00:57:33,701 --> 00:57:35,900
And so I think that would add on to the challenge...

1363
00:57:35,901 --> 00:57:38,071
and competition for me and my partner.

1364
00:57:38,971 --> 00:57:40,871
(The last crew is BUMSUP. Lip J and Hyojin Choi.)

1365
00:57:42,171 --> 00:57:43,911
I'm confident about choreography.

1366
00:57:44,941 --> 00:57:48,680
The crew I have my eyes on...

1367
00:57:48,681 --> 00:57:51,051
is Hyojin Choi and Lip J.

1368
00:57:51,251 --> 00:57:53,181
They've experienced Choreography Selection.

1369
00:57:53,851 --> 00:57:54,920
(Lip J's choreography had been selected for...)

1370
00:57:54,921 --> 00:57:55,991
(the sub-leader class in Season 1.)

1371
00:57:56,321 --> 00:57:57,721
Since hers had been selected,

1372
00:57:58,321 --> 00:58:00,630
I consider her to be my rival.

1373
00:58:00,631 --> 00:58:02,461
The vibe is going to be great.

1374
00:58:02,961 --> 00:58:05,330
Is Lip J waacking?

1375
00:58:05,331 --> 00:58:06,600
- Yes.
- Yes.

1376
00:58:06,601 --> 00:58:07,930
Waacking, surely.

1377
00:58:07,931 --> 00:58:09,571
(Probably)

1378
00:58:09,771 --> 00:58:12,370
You guys might think...

1379
00:58:12,371 --> 00:58:15,040
of my signature move, waacking. It's not in this.

1380
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:18,240
I really thought that it should be able to highlight...

1381
00:58:18,241 --> 00:58:20,551
everyone here and let you all shine.

1382
00:58:21,951 --> 00:58:23,821
I'm confident ours will be chosen.

1383
00:58:27,291 --> 00:58:28,951
(Full of energy)

1384
00:58:31,561 --> 00:58:32,891
They look like they're having fun.

1385
00:58:34,991 --> 00:58:36,931
(Perfect chemistry)

1386
00:58:37,101 --> 00:58:38,901
Choreography that would go viral.

1387
00:58:42,331 --> 00:58:44,371
I liked how united the team felt.

1388
00:58:50,581 --> 00:58:52,241
I love her choreo. She's so cute.

1389
00:58:54,381 --> 00:58:55,711
It looks easy to dance to.

1390
00:58:56,781 --> 00:58:58,951
- And a lot of partner work.
- Yes.

1391
00:59:01,591 --> 00:59:02,650
BUMSUP.

1392
00:59:02,651 --> 00:59:04,590
(Nervous)

1393
00:59:04,591 --> 00:59:07,661
You guys look cute. It was nice chemistry.

1394
00:59:08,291 --> 00:59:11,960
You guys tried your best with utilizing different styles,

1395
00:59:11,961 --> 00:59:14,271
so applause.

1396
00:59:14,431 --> 00:59:15,431
(We did it.)

1397
00:59:15,432 --> 00:59:16,501
But...

1398
00:59:16,831 --> 00:59:19,041
we wanted to see a show-stopping moment.

1399
00:59:19,141 --> 00:59:21,171
Something that can go viral or be trendy.

1400
00:59:22,571 --> 00:59:24,911
Like, with that kind of movements, I really considered such aspects.

1401
00:59:26,811 --> 00:59:30,850
There were many iconic and catchy parts.

1402
00:59:30,851 --> 00:59:33,050
But the downside was...

1403
00:59:33,051 --> 00:59:34,920
that having so many such parts...

1404
00:59:34,921 --> 00:59:38,091
made it difficult for us to see what the crew wanted to show.

1405
00:59:38,421 --> 00:59:40,291
So, shall we just vote and open it?

1406
00:59:40,361 --> 00:59:41,561
- Lovely.
- Okay.

1407
00:59:41,991 --> 00:59:44,261
Let's do it without voting for our own team.

1408
00:59:44,931 --> 00:59:46,061
Let's go.

1409
00:59:46,161 --> 00:59:47,901
(They're curious about the result.)

1410
00:59:48,971 --> 00:59:52,240
- BUMSUP, RHTokyo...
- BUMPSUP.

1411
00:59:52,241 --> 00:59:54,470
- BUMSUP.
- AG SQUAD.

1412
00:59:54,471 --> 00:59:55,641
There's MOTIV.

1413
00:59:56,411 --> 00:59:59,011
It's out of BUMSUP and RHTokyo.

1414
00:59:59,081 --> 01:00:02,610
Our choreography isn't just simple.

1415
01:00:02,611 --> 01:00:04,380
We added the iconic movements...

1416
01:00:04,381 --> 01:00:06,450
even non-dancers would recognize.

1417
01:00:06,451 --> 01:00:10,620
We'll be very happy if you can focus on that.

1418
01:00:10,621 --> 01:00:11,991
(You have a point.)

1419
01:00:12,161 --> 01:00:16,891
As we prepared this choreography... Actually, I really considered...

1420
01:00:17,201 --> 01:00:20,301
every bit of movement while thinking about you guys.

1421
01:00:20,501 --> 01:00:22,471
So I tried my best.

1422
01:00:23,131 --> 01:00:24,140
(Nodding)

1423
01:00:24,141 --> 01:00:26,141
I'm certain that our choreography will be chosen.

1424
01:00:26,641 --> 01:00:28,171
I have confidence in our choreography.

1425
01:00:28,411 --> 01:00:29,540
(What will be the result...)

1426
01:00:29,541 --> 01:00:31,641
(of the Choreography Selection for the rookie class?)

1427
01:00:32,641 --> 01:00:34,311
- What happened?
- Did you get it?

1428
01:00:34,911 --> 01:00:36,351
- Well done.
- Well done.

1429
01:00:37,381 --> 01:00:38,921
For the rookie class...

1430
01:00:39,681 --> 01:00:41,350
The result is...

1431
01:00:41,351 --> 01:00:42,921
(Expectant)

1432
01:00:43,021 --> 01:00:44,361
(Nervous)

1433
01:00:44,421 --> 01:00:45,991
For the rookie class,

1434
01:00:46,791 --> 01:00:48,560
BUMSUP's choreography got chosen.

1435
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:50,701
(For the rookie class, BUMSUP's choreography got chosen.)

1436
01:00:51,101 --> 01:00:53,701
(Cheering)

1437
01:00:54,201 --> 01:00:55,301
Our choreography didn't get chosen.

1438
01:00:59,171 --> 01:01:01,671
We were included in the two final choices.

1439
01:01:01,911 --> 01:01:02,971
Then what happened?

1440
01:01:03,041 --> 01:01:04,580
We chose RHTokyo...

1441
01:01:04,581 --> 01:01:06,910
because we can all execute the movements.

1442
01:01:06,911 --> 01:01:09,611
- I think it's very risky, though.
- And if you take the chance...

1443
01:01:09,781 --> 01:01:12,520
Can you guys pick up BUMSUP's choreography in a day?

1444
01:01:12,521 --> 01:01:14,021
- Oh, yes.
- Yes.

1445
01:01:14,791 --> 01:01:15,791
(Pouting)

1446
01:01:15,792 --> 01:01:17,291
I don't think we should take the risk.

1447
01:01:17,791 --> 01:01:19,391
We all chose BUMSUP.

1448
01:01:19,521 --> 01:01:20,631
Thank you.

1449
01:01:20,691 --> 01:01:23,361
Oh, my gosh. Thank you.

1450
01:01:23,491 --> 01:01:25,901
(Disappointed)

1451
01:01:26,901 --> 01:01:29,871
We thought that we'd win.

1452
01:01:30,331 --> 01:01:32,401
I was very upset.

1453
01:01:32,571 --> 01:01:37,071
RHTokyo will make sure to take BUMSUP's choreography.

1454
01:01:37,211 --> 01:01:40,211
AG SQUAD said that ours was the worst choreography.

1455
01:01:40,481 --> 01:01:43,450
It was quite clear who stuck to their brand...

1456
01:01:43,451 --> 01:01:46,451
and didn't think about how we could utilize other styles.

1457
01:01:46,781 --> 01:01:47,950
That's crazy.

1458
01:01:47,951 --> 01:01:49,091
(The youngest one is sad.)

1459
01:01:49,521 --> 01:01:50,791
I'm getting stressed out.

1460
01:01:51,521 --> 01:01:54,091
I thought it was cute and very childish.

1461
01:01:54,491 --> 01:01:56,090
(Choreography Selection for the rookie class)

1462
01:01:56,091 --> 01:01:58,201
(ROYAL FAMILY's choreography was the same as their past performance.)

1463
01:01:58,561 --> 01:02:00,000
They copied that.

1464
01:02:00,001 --> 01:02:04,341
I hope this is a great lesson for them to start...

1465
01:02:04,501 --> 01:02:05,801
So what was the score?

1466
01:02:05,971 --> 01:02:09,571
BUMSUP's. BUMSUP's choreography wasn't as strong.

1467
01:02:09,971 --> 01:02:11,740
It's something that we can play with.

1468
01:02:11,741 --> 01:02:13,881
It's something that we can execute more strongly.

1469
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:15,380
We can kill them all.

1470
01:02:15,381 --> 01:02:17,951
Yes. I'm excited to take on their choreography.

1471
01:02:18,281 --> 01:02:20,481
The rookie class' choreography was good, so it's too bad.

1472
01:02:20,621 --> 01:02:22,621
It was much better than the Korean team's.

1473
01:02:23,051 --> 01:02:24,421
We got bullied.

1474
01:02:25,591 --> 01:02:26,591
I'm annoyed.

1475
01:02:26,592 --> 01:02:30,390
We'll definitely take the main dancer position.

1476
01:02:30,391 --> 01:02:31,860
Tomorrow is more important.

1477
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:34,100
You guys need to defend, other crews need to take.

1478
01:02:34,101 --> 01:02:37,031
- Defend it.
- We can totally do that.

1479
01:02:37,501 --> 01:02:40,201
(Choreography Selection for the leader class)

1480
01:02:40,271 --> 01:02:41,870
(The leaders warm up amidst tension in the air.)

1481
01:02:41,871 --> 01:02:45,010
The atmosphere for the leaders... I could definitely tell...

1482
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,381
that the energy was tense.

1483
01:02:46,841 --> 01:02:49,081
Everyone has years of experience.

1484
01:02:49,211 --> 01:02:51,220
This is truly a global game.

1485
01:02:51,221 --> 01:02:53,850
These are the members who are rarely in one place.

1486
01:02:53,851 --> 01:02:57,220
Kaea appears in many famous choreography videos.

1487
01:02:57,221 --> 01:02:58,620
Super Bowl halftime show was one of them.

1488
01:02:58,621 --> 01:03:01,030
Don't you think that Kaea and Teesha will have similar choreographies?

1489
01:03:01,031 --> 01:03:02,960
They're from the same crew.

1490
01:03:02,961 --> 01:03:05,360
Mine and hers might be quite similar.

1491
01:03:05,361 --> 01:03:06,560
We're going to be... I don't know.

1492
01:03:06,561 --> 01:03:08,331
She might bring something completely different.

1493
01:03:08,601 --> 01:03:10,400
Being the youngest choreographer,

1494
01:03:10,401 --> 01:03:12,641
I'm going to bring a different kind of style.

1495
01:03:13,641 --> 01:03:15,210
Honey J does do hip-hop.

1496
01:03:15,211 --> 01:03:17,340
But when it comes to stylization,

1497
01:03:17,341 --> 01:03:19,081
I favor what I can do.

1498
01:03:19,211 --> 01:03:20,680
Rie Hata and Marlee.

1499
01:03:20,681 --> 01:03:22,350
The song suits them. Yes.

1500
01:03:22,351 --> 01:03:25,820
Rie Hata. She's the girl I have to watch out for.

1501
01:03:25,821 --> 01:03:29,090
Among the leaders, the most famous choreographer...

1502
01:03:29,091 --> 01:03:30,520
is Rie Hata.

1503
01:03:30,521 --> 01:03:33,521
She's, like, being booked by other choreographers.

1504
01:03:33,761 --> 01:03:36,560
Leader class. It's going to be a strong competition.

1505
01:03:36,561 --> 01:03:38,361
It's definitely not going to be the easiest.

1506
01:03:38,461 --> 01:03:40,330
(Among the talented leaders, whose choreography will get chosen?)

1507
01:03:40,331 --> 01:03:42,401
I didn't care about the order.

1508
01:03:42,931 --> 01:03:44,970
(The leader of OSAKA Ojo Gang, Ibuki goes first.)

1509
01:03:44,971 --> 01:03:47,370
I couldn't predict Ibuki's choreography, to be honest.

1510
01:03:47,371 --> 01:03:49,140
I've only seen her do waacking,

1511
01:03:49,141 --> 01:03:51,740
I don't know how her choreography will go.

1512
01:03:51,741 --> 01:03:54,810
As you know, I'm really a freestyle dancer.

1513
01:03:54,811 --> 01:03:58,480
And this is actually my first time to choreograph a hip-hop song.

1514
01:03:58,481 --> 01:04:01,350
Hip-hop choreography isn't her strong suit.

1515
01:04:01,351 --> 01:04:05,090
It isn't a genre Ibuki is good at,

1516
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:07,960
so I expect her to be at a disadvantage.

1517
01:04:07,961 --> 01:04:10,900
I can make a waacking choreography in 30 minutes,

1518
01:04:10,901 --> 01:04:12,800
but hip-hop really isn't my style.

1519
01:04:12,801 --> 01:04:15,600
So I considered various facets and put in a lot of effort.

1520
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:16,630
I think there's this tendency...

1521
01:04:16,631 --> 01:04:18,840
of people choosing the choreography that's easy for them.

1522
01:04:18,841 --> 01:04:22,040
As a strategy, I made a choreography that'd be easy for everyone.

1523
01:04:22,041 --> 01:04:25,080
I kept it as simple as I could...

1524
01:04:25,081 --> 01:04:26,740
so that many people could try it.

1525
01:04:26,741 --> 01:04:30,080
If Ibuki dances in a style she's good at,

1526
01:04:30,081 --> 01:04:32,651
it'll be hard for the other five.

1527
01:04:32,781 --> 01:04:34,820
So a chance of that choreography getting picked will be slim.

1528
01:04:34,821 --> 01:04:36,850
Not everyone can waack.

1529
01:04:36,851 --> 01:04:38,090
I wouldn't pick waacking...

1530
01:04:38,091 --> 01:04:39,760
because I know that I can't pull off waacking.

1531
01:04:39,761 --> 01:04:41,261
I made it very simple.

1532
01:04:41,331 --> 01:04:43,530
(As everyone watches worriedly, Ibuki begins the choreography.)

1533
01:04:43,531 --> 01:04:46,031
(How will be the choreography by Ibuki, a waacker?)

1534
01:04:50,601 --> 01:04:52,870
Didn't she say that it was her first hip-hop choreography?

1535
01:04:52,871 --> 01:04:55,311
The choreography was better than I expected.

1536
01:04:57,481 --> 01:05:00,211
She had a few trendy moves.

1537
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:03,581
I could do her routine.

1538
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:07,451
I added a bit of waacking.

1539
01:05:08,051 --> 01:05:09,590
Everyone will be able to do it.

1540
01:05:09,591 --> 01:05:10,890
(Ibuki added waacking movements to the choreography.)

1541
01:05:10,891 --> 01:05:12,861
She added, like, a little bit of waacking.

1542
01:05:13,191 --> 01:05:16,490
Throughout the choreography, it just got complicated.

1543
01:05:16,491 --> 01:05:19,100
It was catchy and energetic.

1544
01:05:19,101 --> 01:05:21,200
I was it was very nice.

1545
01:05:21,201 --> 01:05:23,570
Your power was very strong.

1546
01:05:23,571 --> 01:05:26,740
But I also think that sometimes, things felt a little bit rushed.

1547
01:05:26,741 --> 01:05:28,770
Did you just say that you made it simple?

1548
01:05:28,771 --> 01:05:30,740
- It's not.
- It's just the ending.

1549
01:05:30,741 --> 01:05:32,040
There's just this at the end.

1550
01:05:32,041 --> 01:05:33,380
It's too hard for us.

1551
01:05:33,381 --> 01:05:35,550
The choreography wasn't very memorable.

1552
01:05:35,551 --> 01:05:37,010
I thought that it was hard.

1553
01:05:37,011 --> 01:05:38,680
If I audition with that,

1554
01:05:38,681 --> 01:05:41,450
I might not have a chance of becoming the main dancer.

1555
01:05:41,451 --> 01:05:42,750
I was truly surprised.

1556
01:05:42,751 --> 01:05:45,920
To me, the choreography was incredibly simple.

1557
01:05:45,921 --> 01:05:48,160
Kaea and Teesha.

1558
01:05:48,161 --> 01:05:50,430
They might have similar approaches.

1559
01:05:50,431 --> 01:05:52,061
They have similar roots.

1560
01:05:52,161 --> 01:05:54,830
I really wanted to focus on...

1561
01:05:54,831 --> 01:05:56,970
So the ROYAL FAMILY style is...

1562
01:05:56,971 --> 01:05:58,600
- simple...
- But effective.

1563
01:05:58,601 --> 01:06:00,241
(Simple, but effective dance)

1564
01:06:00,341 --> 01:06:02,140
(They had a similar key point for their choreography.)

1565
01:06:02,141 --> 01:06:04,540
I'm very well-known in music videos.

1566
01:06:04,541 --> 01:06:06,410
And I'm always the main dancer.

1567
01:06:06,411 --> 01:06:08,850
From my experience of being in many music videos,

1568
01:06:08,851 --> 01:06:12,381
I do know what people love to watch.

1569
01:06:12,751 --> 01:06:13,980
(How will be the choreography of Kaea,)

1570
01:06:13,981 --> 01:06:15,191
(the dancer with the best career?)

1571
01:06:18,761 --> 01:06:19,761
(Moving)

1572
01:06:19,762 --> 01:06:22,361
Her choreography seemed clear.

1573
01:06:26,301 --> 01:06:27,301
(Focused)

1574
01:06:29,531 --> 01:06:31,400
It was strong and powerful.

1575
01:06:31,401 --> 01:06:33,600
I got the vibe of women's power.

1576
01:06:33,601 --> 01:06:35,241
I thought it was nice.

1577
01:06:35,611 --> 01:06:37,371
(Flexible)

1578
01:06:38,341 --> 01:06:39,410
It's hard.

1579
01:06:39,411 --> 01:06:40,540
I'll get a backache.

1580
01:06:40,541 --> 01:06:41,550
This is very her.

1581
01:06:41,551 --> 01:06:43,080
She lies on the floor.

1582
01:06:43,081 --> 01:06:44,220
(Kaea's choreography requires a lot of back strength.)

1583
01:06:44,221 --> 01:06:46,850
Copying the choreography will be a bit risky.

1584
01:06:46,851 --> 01:06:48,620
\My choreography is better.

1585
01:06:48,621 --> 01:06:50,590
\My choreography was more...

1586
01:06:50,591 --> 01:06:51,860
simple and effective...

1587
01:06:51,861 --> 01:06:53,691
for people to easily do.

1588
01:06:53,791 --> 01:06:55,331
(Up next is Teesha, the leader of ROYAL FAMILY.)

1589
01:06:58,461 --> 01:07:00,730
Thanks to her young age, her movements were definitely clean.

1590
01:07:00,731 --> 01:07:01,931
She had good control.

1591
01:07:10,241 --> 01:07:11,810
It was similar to Kaea's...

1592
01:07:11,811 --> 01:07:15,051
in terms of requiring a lot of power and energy.

1593
01:07:15,811 --> 01:07:17,411
It had the ROYAL FAMILY vibe.

1594
01:07:20,921 --> 01:07:23,921
I knew she was going to do that movement and repeat it.

1595
01:07:26,991 --> 01:07:28,960
The song had the K-pop vibe.

1596
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:32,230
Compared to the song, the dance was too difficult.

1597
01:07:32,231 --> 01:07:34,160
All the movements were strong.

1598
01:07:34,161 --> 01:07:35,531
It was too complicated.

1599
01:07:35,601 --> 01:07:38,401
I personally like Kaea's choreography more.

1600
01:07:39,871 --> 01:07:42,811
I don't think I want to try this choreography.

1601
01:07:44,241 --> 01:07:45,411
Her words were so direct.

1602
01:07:45,911 --> 01:07:47,081
Ibuki is forceful.

1603
01:07:47,751 --> 01:07:48,911
Marlee.

1604
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:50,950
I'm interested in seeing what she's going to bring.

1605
01:07:50,951 --> 01:07:52,080
Will it be the original hip-hop?

1606
01:07:52,081 --> 01:07:53,650
Marlee's style has...

1607
01:07:53,651 --> 01:07:55,490
the vibe of American hip-hop.

1608
01:07:55,491 --> 01:07:58,290
The music was based on hip-hop, so she had a significant advantage.

1609
01:07:58,291 --> 01:08:00,660
A lot of people know me for hip-hop that I do,

1610
01:08:00,661 --> 01:08:04,661
but I also wanted to show that I can do a commercial choreography.

1611
01:08:05,201 --> 01:08:07,731
(What kind of choreography did Marlee make?)

1612
01:08:13,541 --> 01:08:14,771
What? It's cute.

1613
01:08:18,411 --> 01:08:19,511
So she can make such facial expressions.

1614
01:08:20,781 --> 01:08:22,210
Shall I call it kitschy?

1615
01:08:22,211 --> 01:08:24,480
There were witty and cute parts.

1616
01:08:24,481 --> 01:08:26,920
Although it was hip-hop, it wasn't too rebellious.

1617
01:08:26,921 --> 01:08:30,551
I was surprised by the cute expressions.

1618
01:08:31,721 --> 01:08:33,621
But there are too many steps.

1619
01:08:34,531 --> 01:08:36,091
I don't know which part is the highlight.

1620
01:08:38,501 --> 01:08:40,630
I expected her to compete with the choreography...

1621
01:08:40,631 --> 01:08:42,800
with impressive hip-hop skills.

1622
01:08:42,801 --> 01:08:46,170
I never expected you to be kind of, like,

1623
01:08:46,171 --> 01:08:47,171
cute.

1624
01:08:47,172 --> 01:08:50,241
(Witty expressions stood out in Marlee's choreography.)

1625
01:08:50,371 --> 01:08:52,710
I thought it was kind of, like, cute.

1626
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:54,141
But I think...

1627
01:08:54,981 --> 01:08:59,981
the first half and the last half had similar rhythm and energy.

1628
01:09:00,521 --> 01:09:02,790
I can't think of the key point.

1629
01:09:02,791 --> 01:09:04,321
She added too many movements.

1630
01:09:04,991 --> 01:09:06,161
(There wasn't a dance move that stood out as a highlight.)

1631
01:09:06,221 --> 01:09:08,461
It was weak in that aspect.

1632
01:09:09,031 --> 01:09:10,061
Who's next?

1633
01:09:10,091 --> 01:09:12,001
Is it my turn?

1634
01:09:12,801 --> 01:09:16,271
The biggest threat in this mission would be Rie.

1635
01:09:16,501 --> 01:09:19,770
I thought of it as Rie Hata's round.

1636
01:09:19,771 --> 01:09:22,610
The song suited her style well.

1637
01:09:22,611 --> 01:09:25,080
When I first heard the music,

1638
01:09:25,081 --> 01:09:26,980
I thought it belonged to Rie.

1639
01:09:26,981 --> 01:09:30,250
I just think it belongs to Rie.

1640
01:09:30,251 --> 01:09:33,551
I thought it was a song Rie already choreographed before.

1641
01:09:34,281 --> 01:09:36,890
It's a style I'm good at.

1642
01:09:36,891 --> 01:09:40,661
I like expressing boyish charms.

1643
01:09:40,761 --> 01:09:45,431
I enjoy making choreography for male idol songs.

1644
01:09:45,661 --> 01:09:49,000
(Rie Hata worked on the choreography for many famous male idols.)

1645
01:09:49,001 --> 01:09:51,371
I have some choreography experience,

1646
01:09:51,471 --> 01:09:54,141
so I don't think I would have a rival.

1647
01:09:54,241 --> 01:09:56,411
I am 100 percent confident.

1648
01:09:56,741 --> 01:10:00,341
(What choreography will Rie Hata show?)

1649
01:10:02,081 --> 01:10:03,451
(Watching)

1650
01:10:17,031 --> 01:10:19,061
It was very Rie Hata.

1651
01:10:20,161 --> 01:10:22,601
Her dance is very interesting.

1652
01:10:22,871 --> 01:10:24,701
Her moves were memorable.

1653
01:10:26,541 --> 01:10:28,910
She used movements...

1654
01:10:28,911 --> 01:10:31,341
that embody what the song and the lyrics were all about.

1655
01:10:32,011 --> 01:10:34,080
What I was worried about...

1656
01:10:34,081 --> 01:10:36,710
was that Rie Hata's style was too strong.

1657
01:10:36,711 --> 01:10:39,281
I wasn't sure if we could copy the choreography.

1658
01:10:40,251 --> 01:10:42,350
To be honest, I know it's a competition,

1659
01:10:42,351 --> 01:10:44,920
but it's just iconic. You know?

1660
01:10:44,921 --> 01:10:47,460
Rie's choreography...

1661
01:10:47,461 --> 01:10:48,791
really can't be bad.

1662
01:10:48,891 --> 01:10:52,100
I think everyone would want to dance the choreography,

1663
01:10:52,101 --> 01:10:55,801
but I don't think anyone could dance better than you.

1664
01:10:56,201 --> 01:10:58,940
You added elements that we could all do,

1665
01:10:58,941 --> 01:11:00,841
but it still felt very Rie.

1666
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:02,141
I didn't want to pick her.

1667
01:11:02,441 --> 01:11:04,710
It would be harder to steal her choreography.

1668
01:11:04,711 --> 01:11:08,011
It's really hard to bring out the feel of Rie Hata's moves.

1669
01:11:08,081 --> 01:11:10,511
It requires a lot of resistance.

1670
01:11:10,611 --> 01:11:13,921
To create that resistance, you have to tense your body.

1671
01:11:14,081 --> 01:11:16,451
That's really hard.

1672
01:11:17,091 --> 01:11:19,521
(Will Rie Hata's choreography be picked?)

1673
01:11:19,621 --> 01:11:21,190
(The last dancer, BUMSUP's leader Honey J)

1674
01:11:21,191 --> 01:11:24,160
Korea couldn't lose in this battle.

1675
01:11:24,161 --> 01:11:25,701
It was a Korean song.

1676
01:11:25,901 --> 01:11:30,131
It's a song that all Koreans know.

1677
01:11:30,331 --> 01:11:32,441
(When the song was revealed)

1678
01:11:32,571 --> 01:11:33,670
(Came back again)

1679
01:11:33,671 --> 01:11:35,041
There's a concept.

1680
01:11:35,141 --> 01:11:38,040
(It's a melody that makes you sing along.)

1681
01:11:38,041 --> 01:11:40,211
I couldn't just skip it.

1682
01:11:40,311 --> 01:11:42,281
The first part of the song...

1683
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:46,621
remixed a traditional Korean song.

1684
01:11:46,721 --> 01:11:49,850
So I thought it would be nice...

1685
01:11:49,851 --> 01:11:51,261
to experience some Korean elements together.

1686
01:11:51,361 --> 01:11:55,091
so I thought about what choreography I could make...

1687
01:11:55,191 --> 01:11:56,291
so we could all dance to it together.

1688
01:11:56,661 --> 01:11:59,900
I have the best understanding of the song.

1689
01:11:59,901 --> 01:12:01,200
But if my choreography doesn't get picked,

1690
01:12:01,201 --> 01:12:03,531
that would be weird.

1691
01:12:03,971 --> 01:12:05,900
(What's the choreography with Korean elements?)

1692
01:12:05,901 --> 01:12:07,911
I'm very excited to see what she's going to bring.

1693
01:12:12,741 --> 01:12:13,910
(Interesting)

1694
01:12:13,911 --> 01:12:15,080
(Focused)

1695
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:17,781
I expressed hitting janggu.

1696
01:12:18,781 --> 01:12:21,951
I could really see that she put a lot of thought into it.

1697
01:12:23,021 --> 01:12:24,720
I did like Honey J's one.

1698
01:12:24,721 --> 01:12:27,721
She did a move that every dancer was good at.

1699
01:12:30,661 --> 01:12:33,761
The way she approached it was fun and relatable.

1700
01:12:43,641 --> 01:12:45,441
(Honey J's demonstration ended.)

1701
01:12:46,281 --> 01:12:48,381
- That was so good.
- Thank you.

1702
01:12:48,481 --> 01:12:50,680
Her choreography was very thorough.

1703
01:12:50,681 --> 01:12:54,820
She tried to incorporate Korean culture and history,

1704
01:12:54,821 --> 01:12:56,421
and I really respected that.

1705
01:12:56,521 --> 01:13:00,360
I loved the way you incorporated Korean elements,

1706
01:13:00,361 --> 01:13:01,761
and I really liked the flow.

1707
01:13:03,361 --> 01:13:06,300
It didn't look like there were parts that we couldn't do.

1708
01:13:06,301 --> 01:13:07,870
So that was a plus for you.

1709
01:13:07,871 --> 01:13:09,801
I actually really like it.

1710
01:13:11,071 --> 01:13:12,370
It was iconic.

1711
01:13:12,371 --> 01:13:14,271
It had professional dancing.

1712
01:13:14,501 --> 01:13:16,840
And the weakness, I don't have.

1713
01:13:16,841 --> 01:13:18,240
(That's a great compliment.)

1714
01:13:18,241 --> 01:13:19,811
I want to say it, but I don't have.

1715
01:13:19,911 --> 01:13:23,451
Such a harsh woman was saying such nice words to me.

1716
01:13:23,551 --> 01:13:25,351
I felt really happy.

1717
01:13:25,681 --> 01:13:27,020
Very interesting.

1718
01:13:27,021 --> 01:13:29,651
Everyone has different...

1719
01:13:31,521 --> 01:13:34,761
I respect your concept, what you explained.

1720
01:13:34,861 --> 01:13:37,461
But I don't remember anything.

1721
01:13:38,031 --> 01:13:40,731
The only thing I remember is the intro.

1722
01:13:41,771 --> 01:13:43,971
I couldn't feel the energy.

1723
01:13:44,071 --> 01:13:46,001
What part of it is Korean?

1724
01:13:46,741 --> 01:13:50,011
A dancer shouldn't explain with words.

1725
01:13:50,071 --> 01:13:53,141
I wanted her to express that with the energy when she danced.

1726
01:13:53,381 --> 01:13:56,551
My choreography was better.

1727
01:13:56,651 --> 01:13:58,781
I was still confident.

1728
01:14:00,151 --> 01:14:01,151
But...

1729
01:14:02,151 --> 01:14:05,220
I think Honey J's choreography is what everyone can use...

1730
01:14:05,221 --> 01:14:06,461
to express themselves.

1731
01:14:07,161 --> 01:14:08,831
Thank you, Ibuki.

1732
01:14:09,191 --> 01:14:12,761
I didn't want to dance to Rie Hata's choreography.

1733
01:14:12,861 --> 01:14:16,201
Okay. Can we start negotiating?

1734
01:14:16,431 --> 01:14:17,870
- Ibuki.
- Teesha.

1735
01:14:17,871 --> 01:14:19,470
- Honey J.
- Rie Hata.

1736
01:14:19,471 --> 01:14:20,971
- Honey J.
- Rie's.

1737
01:14:21,071 --> 01:14:22,571
It's really hard.

1738
01:14:22,671 --> 01:14:24,610
Marlee and Ibuki...

1739
01:14:24,611 --> 01:14:26,541
said Honey J's choreography, right?

1740
01:14:26,641 --> 01:14:28,451
Which part did you want to do?

1741
01:14:28,551 --> 01:14:30,051
The beginning intro.

1742
01:14:30,511 --> 01:14:32,021
And the rest of it.

1743
01:14:32,421 --> 01:14:33,421
Okay.

1744
01:14:33,981 --> 01:14:34,991
Was she checking on me?

1745
01:14:35,091 --> 01:14:38,191
Honestly, I think...

1746
01:14:38,291 --> 01:14:39,361
my choreography is better.

1747
01:14:39,561 --> 01:14:43,431
I'm confident that if we all do my choreography,

1748
01:14:43,531 --> 01:14:46,431
this music video will look very fun.

1749
01:14:46,531 --> 01:14:48,301
You should trust my choreography.

1750
01:14:48,731 --> 01:14:51,171
It's because it's Rie. I dance.

1751
01:14:51,271 --> 01:14:54,541
But it feels like if we all do this together,

1752
01:14:54,641 --> 01:14:57,041
we'd be like RHTokyo.

1753
01:14:57,441 --> 01:14:59,211
Teacher and students.

1754
01:14:59,311 --> 01:15:01,350
A crew that follows their teacher.

1755
01:15:01,351 --> 01:15:05,280
It really would seem like RHTokyo.

1756
01:15:05,281 --> 01:15:06,921
I didn't want that.

1757
01:15:07,021 --> 01:15:09,350
I think the picture of the best leaders coming together...

1758
01:15:09,351 --> 01:15:12,721
and creating a new style is what's interesting.

1759
01:15:12,991 --> 01:15:15,491
But that was just Rie Hata's dance.

1760
01:15:15,591 --> 01:15:18,300
My dance wouldn't make us look like BUMSUP.

1761
01:15:18,301 --> 01:15:19,860
But if we danced her choreography,

1762
01:15:19,861 --> 01:15:21,771
we had to look like RHTokyo.

1763
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:25,371
Most of you guys are saying this is too Rie.

1764
01:15:25,801 --> 01:15:29,241
But if you do this, you'll feel really good.

1765
01:15:29,611 --> 01:15:31,811
And you're going to dance really good.

1766
01:15:31,911 --> 01:15:34,440
I promise it won't look like RHTokyo.

1767
01:15:34,441 --> 01:15:38,451
I didn't agree with her refutation.

1768
01:15:38,781 --> 01:15:39,781
Well...

1769
01:15:40,481 --> 01:15:44,350
I feel like everyone is focused on the video.

1770
01:15:44,351 --> 01:15:46,491
We might be thinking too far ahead.

1771
01:15:46,591 --> 01:15:48,961
Tomorrow, we're auditioning the piece.

1772
01:15:49,061 --> 01:15:51,290
That should be kept in mind when picking.

1773
01:15:51,291 --> 01:15:53,401
This is still a competition.

1774
01:15:53,731 --> 01:15:55,630
I was also trying to think strategically...

1775
01:15:55,631 --> 01:15:58,000
and focus on a choreography that I can steal.

1776
01:15:58,001 --> 01:16:00,001
(What will be the result of the Choreography Selection?)

1777
01:16:00,341 --> 01:16:01,371
(RHTokyo's room)

1778
01:16:02,071 --> 01:16:03,071
I'm back.

1779
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:04,741
You're back.

1780
01:16:05,441 --> 01:16:06,481
Why?

1781
01:16:06,581 --> 01:16:09,381
To tell you the result, it wasn't chosen yet.

1782
01:16:09,881 --> 01:16:11,210
(Rie Hata versus Honey J)

1783
01:16:11,211 --> 01:16:13,051
Everyone is deciding between Rie Hata's and Honey J's.

1784
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:16,050
Me and Ibuki voted Honey J.

1785
01:16:16,051 --> 01:16:17,791
Me and Teesha went for Rie Hata.

1786
01:16:17,891 --> 01:16:19,061
But it feels like...

1787
01:16:19,261 --> 01:16:23,160
Rie's choreography can be danced best by Rie.

1788
01:16:23,161 --> 01:16:27,030
If her choreography gets chosen, she would become the main dancer.

1789
01:16:27,031 --> 01:16:28,031
That's right.

1790
01:16:28,032 --> 01:16:29,871
If no one's picking my dance,

1791
01:16:30,071 --> 01:16:33,170
I want to pick the dance that I know I can steal.

1792
01:16:33,171 --> 01:16:34,171
Right.

1793
01:16:34,172 --> 01:16:35,610
Thinking about it strategically,

1794
01:16:35,611 --> 01:16:38,740
obviously you get more points if you gave your choreography...

1795
01:16:38,741 --> 01:16:40,081
Right.

1796
01:16:40,241 --> 01:16:42,950
Honey J's choreography is easier.

1797
01:16:42,951 --> 01:16:45,651
She incorporated moves that all of us can do as well.

1798
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:47,581
She did moves like this.

1799
01:16:48,251 --> 01:16:49,591
Moves by Rie Hata...

1800
01:16:51,391 --> 01:16:52,921
All of us will be able to do it.

1801
01:16:53,021 --> 01:16:56,091
It's more like our style too.

1802
01:16:58,301 --> 01:16:59,960
Decisions.

1803
01:16:59,961 --> 01:17:01,030
(Marlee's head is overloaded from making the hard decision.)

1804
01:17:01,031 --> 01:17:02,070
(What should I do?)

1805
01:17:02,071 --> 01:17:03,101
What do I do?

1806
01:17:04,071 --> 01:17:05,841
I honestly don't know what would happen.

1807
01:17:06,071 --> 01:17:07,071
(In that case)

1808
01:17:07,071 --> 01:17:08,071
(What?)

1809
01:17:08,072 --> 01:17:10,811
Let's go to a convenience store. Let's get some chocolates.

1810
01:17:11,441 --> 01:17:12,681
No.

1811
01:17:13,081 --> 01:17:14,081
We can't do that.

1812
01:17:14,281 --> 01:17:17,080
I think yours will get chosen.

1813
01:17:17,081 --> 01:17:19,380
We still want to see your choreography.

1814
01:17:19,381 --> 01:17:20,520
- You want to see it?
- Yes.

1815
01:17:20,521 --> 01:17:21,690
I'll get going. Thank you.

1816
01:17:21,691 --> 01:17:22,991
(Whose choreography will be chosen?)

1817
01:17:23,091 --> 01:17:25,090
(The leaders are back to make the final decision.)

1818
01:17:25,091 --> 01:17:27,421
Have we come up with a decision?

1819
01:17:28,021 --> 01:17:29,190
(Nodding)

1820
01:17:29,191 --> 01:17:30,330
(It's time to make the final decision.)

1821
01:17:30,331 --> 01:17:31,331
Yes.

1822
01:17:31,701 --> 01:17:36,471
I still believe that Rie Hata's choreography was stronger.

1823
01:17:37,131 --> 01:17:40,070
I'm also not changing my decision.

1824
01:17:40,071 --> 01:17:41,641
(Ibuki gives 1 point to Honey J.)

1825
01:17:41,741 --> 01:17:43,640
(It's up to Teesha and Marley.)

1826
01:17:43,641 --> 01:17:47,980
When you compare the choreographies, mine was better.

1827
01:17:47,981 --> 01:17:50,710
As long as I'm the leader, I can't give up until the end.

1828
01:17:50,711 --> 01:17:51,921
It has to be mine.

1829
01:17:52,351 --> 01:17:54,891
I strongly feel...

1830
01:17:54,991 --> 01:17:56,391
My vote is now...

1831
01:17:57,151 --> 01:17:58,990
I'm back.

1832
01:17:58,991 --> 01:17:59,991
Welcome back!

1833
01:18:00,991 --> 01:18:02,030
(Whose choreography was chosen for the leader class?)

1834
01:18:02,031 --> 01:18:03,861
(Please)

1835
01:18:04,431 --> 01:18:06,300
I'm back.

1836
01:18:06,301 --> 01:18:07,301
Welcome back!

1837
01:18:08,501 --> 01:18:09,501
(Whose choreography was chosen for the leader class?)

1838
01:18:09,502 --> 01:18:10,631
(Please)

1839
01:18:11,801 --> 01:18:12,970
(Here it is.)

1840
01:18:12,971 --> 01:18:14,440
(Rie Hata's choreography was chosen.)

1841
01:18:14,441 --> 01:18:16,311
- Where did you go - Where did you go

1842
01:18:17,471 --> 01:18:19,210
- Amazing.
- It's the best!

1843
01:18:19,211 --> 01:18:20,980
Marlee changed her mind.

1844
01:18:20,981 --> 01:18:22,481
- Really?
- Really?

1845
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:24,050
Rie Hata is the one.

1846
01:18:24,051 --> 01:18:25,780
My vote is now Rie.

1847
01:18:25,781 --> 01:18:27,680
(Marlee changed her choice to Rie Hata!)

1848
01:18:27,681 --> 01:18:30,550
Maybe it's better to pick Rie because...

1849
01:18:30,551 --> 01:18:32,460
when it comes to Rie's style,

1850
01:18:32,461 --> 01:18:35,260
I'm one of the strongest out of the rest of the girls.

1851
01:18:35,261 --> 01:18:39,260
I don't think Kaea, Teesha, Ibuki, or Honey J could dance...

1852
01:18:39,261 --> 01:18:41,160
Rie's piece better than me.

1853
01:18:41,161 --> 01:18:42,171
- Yes.
- That's right.

1854
01:18:42,771 --> 01:18:46,000
Now, I'm going to aim to steal Rie's choreography.

1855
01:18:46,001 --> 01:18:47,600
But I feel like you could still...

1856
01:18:47,601 --> 01:18:49,770
have a chance to do it better than Rie Hata.

1857
01:18:49,771 --> 01:18:51,171
- Because I feel confident.
- Yes.

1858
01:18:51,441 --> 01:18:54,440
Rie Hata incorporated moves that Teesha and I can do.

1859
01:18:54,441 --> 01:18:55,950
And then like this.

1860
01:18:55,951 --> 01:18:57,080
I'm a strong dancer.

1861
01:18:57,081 --> 01:18:59,551
So, I can kill this routine.

1862
01:19:00,481 --> 01:19:02,090
It's hard to compete with leaders.

1863
01:19:02,091 --> 01:19:05,990
But the one who can dance my choreography the best is...

1864
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,161
me.

1865
01:19:07,361 --> 01:19:09,360
(The one who is frustrated about the result.)

1866
01:19:09,361 --> 01:19:10,961
Rie Hata's choreography was chosen.

1867
01:19:13,461 --> 01:19:14,461
- Really?
- Yes.

1868
01:19:14,831 --> 01:19:16,571
I just need to accept this and try my best.

1869
01:19:16,971 --> 01:19:18,070
I feel so disappointed.

1870
01:19:18,071 --> 01:19:19,471
It's so disappointing.

1871
01:19:19,641 --> 01:19:21,000
(I'm so upset.)

1872
01:19:21,001 --> 01:19:23,540
I'm so disappointed. It was exactly the same in season 1.

1873
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:24,940
We voted again between no:ze's piece and mine.

1874
01:19:24,941 --> 01:19:26,680
Then, no:ze's was chosen.

1875
01:19:26,681 --> 01:19:27,880
Honey J. Don't let this get to you.

1876
01:19:27,881 --> 01:19:28,980
I won't let this get to me.

1877
01:19:28,981 --> 01:19:30,210
I can steal her choreography.

1878
01:19:30,211 --> 01:19:31,280
I have to steal it.

1879
01:19:31,281 --> 01:19:32,351
I need to be the main dancer.

1880
01:19:33,521 --> 01:19:34,581
I'm nervous.

1881
01:19:34,821 --> 01:19:38,150
Class Mission is notorious for its brutality.

1882
01:19:38,151 --> 01:19:42,061
I think it's the 1st time we have 4 per team for Class Mission.

1883
01:19:42,791 --> 01:19:46,601
A large group of 24 dancers will dance the chosen choreography.

1884
01:19:47,301 --> 01:19:50,000
I thought ROYAL FAMILY would be the strongest team.

1885
01:19:50,001 --> 01:19:53,700
ROYAL FAMILY has done many performances in a mega group.

1886
01:19:53,701 --> 01:19:56,310
The challenge we're thinking of...

1887
01:19:56,311 --> 01:19:59,210
being the strong work is AG SQUAD.

1888
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:01,981
AG SQUAD, we obviously know them well.

1889
01:20:02,481 --> 01:20:05,520
I'm excited to see it because of Kyra.

1890
01:20:05,521 --> 01:20:07,781
- She's amazing.
- Yes.

1891
01:20:08,081 --> 01:20:12,060
I was in the ROYAL FAMILY dance crew for about seven years.

1892
01:20:12,061 --> 01:20:15,791
I was pretty much the main choreographer.

1893
01:20:15,991 --> 01:20:18,760
AG SQUAD and ROYAL FAMILY...

1894
01:20:18,761 --> 01:20:20,460
probably have a similar style.

1895
01:20:20,461 --> 01:20:22,471
(BUMSUP and RHTokyo are sitting next to each other.)

1896
01:20:23,071 --> 01:20:24,201
BUMSUP.

1897
01:20:24,401 --> 01:20:27,800
BUMSUP. They knew the K-pop scenes really well.

1898
01:20:27,801 --> 01:20:30,111
no:ze was the main dancer at this mission in season 1.

1899
01:20:31,071 --> 01:20:34,981
(no:ze was the main dancer for the leader class in season 1.)

1900
01:20:35,111 --> 01:20:36,851
It's a battle for the main dancer.

1901
01:20:37,551 --> 01:20:40,080
(In the Class Mission in season 2,)

1902
01:20:40,081 --> 01:20:43,420
(Rena was the main dancer for the rookie class.)

1903
01:20:43,421 --> 01:20:44,520
I can never...

1904
01:20:44,521 --> 01:20:45,761
lose.

1905
01:20:45,961 --> 01:20:48,631
I don't really want to lose.

1906
01:20:48,831 --> 01:20:52,060
MOTIV is a crew that specializes in battles.

1907
01:20:52,061 --> 01:20:56,400
But I wonder if they don't have any good choreography.

1908
01:20:56,401 --> 01:20:58,571
K-pop and hip-hop twist. I can take that.

1909
01:20:58,941 --> 01:20:59,971
I can take it.

1910
01:21:00,571 --> 01:21:01,970
I'm a subleader.

1911
01:21:01,971 --> 01:21:04,311
Marlee trusts me with the choreography.

1912
01:21:04,441 --> 01:21:07,110
The middle class of the MOTIV's crew choreography…

1913
01:21:07,111 --> 01:21:09,780
is still hip-hop. It's still groovy.

1914
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:12,650
I also wanted to represent the USA hip hop.

1915
01:21:12,651 --> 01:21:13,850
I want to win with the team.

1916
01:21:13,851 --> 01:21:15,251
I want to win for the team.

1917
01:21:15,791 --> 01:21:18,290
(MOTIV’s choreography, which added K-pop to the USA hip-hop)

1918
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:20,391
(MOTIV's middle class Fantaye, Bella, Nyssa, and Logistx)

1919
01:21:22,991 --> 01:21:24,931
More hip-hop in our vibe.

1920
01:21:31,001 --> 01:21:32,871
They knew how to choreograph.

1921
01:21:34,671 --> 01:21:37,911
MOTIV was better than I expected.

1922
01:21:41,081 --> 01:21:42,651
It's cool being groovy and dancing to the rhythm.

1923
01:21:43,411 --> 01:21:44,751
(Steps are becoming faster.)

1924
01:21:45,281 --> 01:21:48,691
It might've been one of the more difficult ones.

1925
01:21:50,521 --> 01:21:52,460
It's a very hip-hop routine,

1926
01:21:52,461 --> 01:21:54,960
so it could be risky for some other crews.

1927
01:21:54,961 --> 01:21:58,930
MOTIVE opted for more groove, all hip-hop choreography.

1928
01:21:58,931 --> 01:22:00,900
I feel like it'd be harder for us...

1929
01:22:00,901 --> 01:22:02,400
to be all clean together.

1930
01:22:02,401 --> 01:22:04,530
Okay. I see that's how we're playing it.

1931
01:22:04,531 --> 01:22:07,071
Immediately, I went away to feel like a battle day again.

1932
01:22:08,471 --> 01:22:09,640
Let's go.

1933
01:22:09,641 --> 01:22:11,310
(Next turn OSAKA Ojo Gang and RHTokyo)

1934
01:22:11,311 --> 01:22:13,310
Their style is really different.

1935
01:22:13,311 --> 01:22:14,780
The best choreographers...

1936
01:22:14,781 --> 01:22:16,350
and the best battle dancers.

1937
01:22:16,351 --> 01:22:18,720
I've never seen...

1938
01:22:18,721 --> 01:22:22,291
OSAKA Ojo Gang do choreography.

1939
01:22:22,551 --> 01:22:24,451
Everyone dances a different genre.

1940
01:22:24,621 --> 01:22:26,690
Because they're all individual dancers.

1941
01:22:26,691 --> 01:22:27,860
OSAKA Ojo Gang?

1942
01:22:27,861 --> 01:22:29,231
I don't think they could incorporate.

1943
01:22:29,691 --> 01:22:32,661
Other crews would say we wouldn't be able to do this.

1944
01:22:33,061 --> 01:22:34,831
They would say we don't have good teamwork.

1945
01:22:35,371 --> 01:22:39,870
We also have someone good at directing...

1946
01:22:39,871 --> 01:22:41,940
and choreography.

1947
01:22:41,941 --> 01:22:45,581
I'm the leader of Fabulous Sisters.

1948
01:22:45,941 --> 01:22:49,250
The more people I have,

1949
01:22:49,251 --> 01:22:51,950
the better formations I can create.

1950
01:22:51,951 --> 01:22:56,491
Minami and I shared ideas and made choreography.

1951
01:22:56,621 --> 01:22:59,390
We put a lot of effort into the intro...

1952
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:01,421
to give a powerful impression.

1953
01:23:01,791 --> 01:23:02,960
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's choreography with a powerful impression)

1954
01:23:02,961 --> 01:23:04,590
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's middle class Ruu, Hana, Kyoka, and Minami)

1955
01:23:04,591 --> 01:23:06,731
(Amazing!)

1956
01:23:08,331 --> 01:23:09,701
I like the intro.

1957
01:23:10,201 --> 01:23:11,470
(Concentrating)

1958
01:23:11,471 --> 01:23:14,971
From the intro, it was complicated and elaborate.

1959
01:23:16,971 --> 01:23:18,311
I like that one.

1960
01:23:21,711 --> 01:23:23,081
(Cool)

1961
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:29,690
OSAKA Ojo Gang made it better than I expected, and I wanted to do it.

1962
01:23:29,691 --> 01:23:31,450
(The next turn is RHTokyo.)

1963
01:23:31,451 --> 01:23:33,860
I kept RHTokyo in check, to be honest.

1964
01:23:33,861 --> 01:23:35,460
They're one team from the beginning.

1965
01:23:35,461 --> 01:23:37,090
They'll work well together.

1966
01:23:37,091 --> 01:23:39,530
I feel like our competition might be Tokyo.

1967
01:23:39,531 --> 01:23:43,400
People think everyone in RHTokyo is...

1968
01:23:43,401 --> 01:23:46,801
a great choreographer, starting with Rie.

1969
01:23:48,101 --> 01:23:52,240
So, we can never lose in choreography.

1970
01:23:52,241 --> 01:23:53,381
(The choreography of RHTokyo with great choreographers)

1971
01:23:57,181 --> 01:23:58,381
(Watching carefully)

1972
01:24:01,851 --> 01:24:05,721
I thought their choreography wasn't impressive enough.

1973
01:24:06,961 --> 01:24:09,331
I feel like they don't really dance well together.

1974
01:24:10,691 --> 01:24:11,691
(Pause)

1975
01:24:12,361 --> 01:24:13,501
Did they make a mistake?

1976
01:24:13,861 --> 01:24:17,531
It's not possible for RHTokyo to do better than us.

1977
01:24:18,131 --> 01:24:20,970
The mission was for 24 dancers.

1978
01:24:20,971 --> 01:24:25,781
But I feel like the choreography is a bit evolved around four dancers.

1979
01:24:28,111 --> 01:24:29,911
I'm sorry to say this, but it wasn't that great.

1980
01:24:33,851 --> 01:24:36,791
It's too complicated.

1981
01:24:39,191 --> 01:24:41,590
I agree. It was a bit chaotic.

1982
01:24:41,591 --> 01:24:42,691
- They were flustered.
- Yes.

1983
01:24:44,491 --> 01:24:46,160
Did you write that it was messy?

1984
01:24:46,161 --> 01:24:48,730
Yes, the formations.

1985
01:24:48,731 --> 01:24:51,000
- It was too off-centered.
- Yes.

1986
01:24:51,001 --> 01:24:52,001
(Uncleaned and off-centered formation)

1987
01:24:52,002 --> 01:24:55,470
RHTokyo is famous for its great choreography.

1988
01:24:55,471 --> 01:24:56,810
We all watched them with some expectations.

1989
01:24:56,811 --> 01:24:58,980
But there was nothing impressive.

1990
01:24:58,981 --> 01:25:00,281
Nothing.

1991
01:25:00,581 --> 01:25:02,680
AG SQUAD and ROYAL FAMILY.

1992
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:04,880
It seems many of them were on the same team.

1993
01:25:04,881 --> 01:25:07,080
They've dominated competitions with mega crew performances.

1994
01:25:07,081 --> 01:25:09,291
They must be really seasoned.

1995
01:25:09,891 --> 01:25:12,990
(ROYAL FAMILY is entering the fight zone.)

1996
01:25:12,991 --> 01:25:15,760
I think ROYAL FAMILY was our rival today.

1997
01:25:15,761 --> 01:25:18,360
Similarity in style.

1998
01:25:18,361 --> 01:25:20,260
I taught all four of them before.

1999
01:25:20,261 --> 01:25:24,501
ROYAL FAMILY, they've got Moana, Zari, Harmz, and Isla.

2000
01:25:24,801 --> 01:25:27,800
Isla will obviously stand out...

2001
01:25:27,801 --> 01:25:29,270
because she's so strong.

2002
01:25:29,271 --> 01:25:32,880
In the middle class, I have taught Isla.

2003
01:25:32,881 --> 01:25:33,911
She does well.

2004
01:25:34,111 --> 01:25:37,580
I have been in ROYAL FAMILY for one of the longest.

2005
01:25:37,581 --> 01:25:40,721
I'm leading girls in the middle class group.

2006
01:25:41,081 --> 01:25:42,991
Make sure we're in our squat...

2007
01:25:43,091 --> 01:25:44,421
and our timing is right.

2008
01:25:44,851 --> 01:25:46,260
It'd be very similar.

2009
01:25:46,261 --> 01:25:48,191
Our minds are very similar.

2010
01:25:49,061 --> 01:25:52,261
Yes, we have our similarities.

2011
01:25:52,761 --> 01:25:56,371
But there are differences between us and AG SQUAD.

2012
01:25:56,631 --> 01:25:58,941
Their choreography is a kind of,

2013
01:25:59,641 --> 01:26:02,410
based on that older kind of way,

2014
01:26:02,411 --> 01:26:05,940
whereas we have more experience, and this new generation...

2015
01:26:05,941 --> 01:26:07,541
and this new kind of way.

2016
01:26:07,811 --> 01:26:09,250
(The new generation, ROYAL FAMILY's choreography.)

2017
01:26:09,251 --> 01:26:10,251
(Concentrating)

2018
01:26:15,821 --> 01:26:17,251
Make it quite energetic.

2019
01:26:18,491 --> 01:26:20,361
We wanted to show it to AG SQUAD.

2020
01:26:25,161 --> 01:26:26,400
Their vibe is awesome.

2021
01:26:26,401 --> 01:26:27,661
This is ROYAL FAMILY.

2022
01:26:27,761 --> 01:26:29,631
I think ROYAL FAMILY did it well.

2023
01:26:29,971 --> 01:26:31,171
(Perfectly in sync)

2024
01:26:33,501 --> 01:26:35,770
I mean, I get that it's their style.

2025
01:26:35,771 --> 01:26:37,270
We wanted to see something different.

2026
01:26:37,271 --> 01:26:38,681
Rhythm is a bit simple, isn't it?

2027
01:26:38,911 --> 01:26:40,941
- Yes.
- It's the same, like this.

2028
01:26:41,381 --> 01:26:43,981
(A repeated rhythm with the same mood)

2029
01:26:44,151 --> 01:26:46,581
The routine is simple.

2030
01:26:46,881 --> 01:26:49,151
(Each crew is discussing ROYAL FAMILY's choreography.)

2031
01:26:49,251 --> 01:26:51,921
I wonder what AG SQUAD's feedback is going to be.

2032
01:26:52,121 --> 01:26:53,791
Because we do know you guys a lot.

2033
01:26:54,061 --> 01:26:55,391
(Because we do know you a lot.)

2034
01:26:55,661 --> 01:26:57,831
Anything I would've just said, add level.

2035
01:26:57,991 --> 01:26:59,131
(What?)

2036
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:01,201
Because you guys were very...

2037
01:27:01,901 --> 01:27:04,771
(ROYAL FAMILY's choreography emphasized only energy.)

2038
01:27:05,071 --> 01:27:07,001
Or something a little bit softer.

2039
01:27:07,101 --> 01:27:08,241
That'll be none.

2040
01:27:08,441 --> 01:27:11,270
We have more like fire to AG SQUAD.

2041
01:27:11,271 --> 01:27:13,480
We really want to take...

2042
01:27:13,481 --> 01:27:16,051
the main dancer position for the middle class.

2043
01:27:16,351 --> 01:27:18,781
(The next turn is AG SQUAD.)

2044
01:27:18,951 --> 01:27:22,150
I've been a student of Kyra's before in the past.

2045
01:27:22,151 --> 01:27:23,790
So, I know how she leads.

2046
01:27:23,791 --> 01:27:25,320
I know how she choreographs.

2047
01:27:25,321 --> 01:27:28,360
I'm excited to see because it's obviously Kyra.

2048
01:27:28,361 --> 01:27:30,731
- She's amazing.
- Yes.

2049
01:27:31,461 --> 01:27:34,601
I've done a lot of video work and directing.

2050
01:27:34,901 --> 01:27:37,100
I was in the ROYAL FAMILY dance crew.

2051
01:27:37,101 --> 01:27:40,700
Then, I was pretty much the main choreographer.

2052
01:27:40,701 --> 01:27:43,510
Alysha and Kaleece. Drop down.

2053
01:27:43,511 --> 01:27:47,740
Because this is not like you can sit and go to the left.

2054
01:27:47,741 --> 01:27:48,750
You're right.

2055
01:27:48,751 --> 01:27:52,051
Choreography, directing, performances.

2056
01:27:52,121 --> 01:27:53,680
This is my forte.

2057
01:27:53,681 --> 01:27:57,151
We just want to show them what AG SQUAD is about.

2058
01:27:57,451 --> 01:27:59,821
(The choreography of AG SQUAD with solid skills and experience)

2059
01:28:04,131 --> 01:28:07,101
We want to really execute the song.

2060
01:28:07,931 --> 01:28:09,531
(Nervous)

2061
01:28:10,671 --> 01:28:11,801
That's clean.

2062
01:28:13,001 --> 01:28:14,071
They're awesome.

2063
01:28:18,411 --> 01:28:19,580
(Crazy!)

2064
01:28:19,581 --> 01:28:21,140
Pulling up the bandanas.

2065
01:28:21,141 --> 01:28:24,051
I thought that was very smart of them to use the prop.

2066
01:28:24,781 --> 01:28:25,781
That's cool.

2067
01:28:29,221 --> 01:28:30,851
I love a good call and response.

2068
01:28:34,121 --> 01:28:35,690
I loved that moment.

2069
01:28:35,691 --> 01:28:37,130
I said it was dynamic.

2070
01:28:37,131 --> 01:28:40,360
They looked more ROYAL FAMILY than ROYAL FAMILY.

2071
01:28:40,361 --> 01:28:43,100
I'd be so down to do that more than ROYAL FAMILY.

2072
01:28:43,101 --> 01:28:46,001
Tight and clean moments for sure.

2073
01:28:46,201 --> 01:28:48,270
I felt Kyra did a great job.

2074
01:28:48,271 --> 01:28:49,841
I thought they did really well.

2075
01:28:50,141 --> 01:28:53,180
(BUMSUP is last to present the middle class choreography.)

2076
01:28:53,181 --> 01:28:55,750
They were the leaders of their own teams.

2077
01:28:55,751 --> 01:28:58,410
They'd lack teamwork as a crew.

2078
01:28:58,411 --> 01:29:01,480
I think BUMSUP would probably be the most different.

2079
01:29:01,481 --> 01:29:03,620
Sometimes that can be challenging...

2080
01:29:03,621 --> 01:29:05,560
if their voices are all different.

2081
01:29:05,561 --> 01:29:07,060
They're all leaders.

2082
01:29:07,061 --> 01:29:09,560
It's full of people who take the lead...

2083
01:29:09,561 --> 01:29:12,131
instead of following the opinion.

2084
01:29:12,501 --> 01:29:14,000
Who says we're not a team?

2085
01:29:14,001 --> 01:29:16,101
We're totally a team.

2086
01:29:16,271 --> 01:29:18,730
It's a unit. We didn't work together before.

2087
01:29:18,731 --> 01:29:20,400
We all have different styles.

2088
01:29:20,401 --> 01:29:21,701
That's what worried me.

2089
01:29:21,941 --> 01:29:24,070
But when we practiced,

2090
01:29:24,071 --> 01:29:25,210
we didn't feel like a unit.

2091
01:29:25,211 --> 01:29:26,241
We're really cool.

2092
01:29:26,281 --> 01:29:29,150
I won a choreographer award before.

2093
01:29:29,151 --> 01:29:30,610
I also have the K-pop experience.

2094
01:29:30,611 --> 01:29:32,321
I'll be very creative.

2095
01:29:32,421 --> 01:29:33,851
The highlight is the sunglasses.

2096
01:29:34,821 --> 01:29:36,250
They got glasses.

2097
01:29:36,251 --> 01:29:37,951
They have sunglasses.

2098
01:29:38,121 --> 01:29:41,121
- They all got props.
- Right.

2099
01:29:41,161 --> 01:29:42,831
It's amazing just as expected.

2100
01:29:43,591 --> 01:29:44,730
It's K-pop.

2101
01:29:44,731 --> 01:29:46,900
This mission is made for me.

2102
01:29:46,901 --> 01:29:48,461
My strategy is me.

2103
01:29:49,071 --> 01:29:50,531
(What kind of choreography did BUMSUP prepare?)

2104
01:29:53,571 --> 01:29:56,640
Be creative, so they'd want to copy me.

2105
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:58,210
(Focused)

2106
01:29:58,211 --> 01:29:59,840
(Expectant)

2107
01:29:59,841 --> 01:30:01,681
The structure is neat.

2108
01:30:04,811 --> 01:30:06,451
(The attack begins.)

2109
01:30:06,981 --> 01:30:08,950
Turn on. You better...

2110
01:30:08,951 --> 01:30:09,951
(I want to copy them.)

2111
01:30:09,952 --> 01:30:11,151
That's impressive.

2112
01:30:13,921 --> 01:30:15,121
I like this.

2113
01:30:18,131 --> 01:30:20,661
Their piece was very K-pop.

2114
01:30:23,231 --> 01:30:24,901
Period.

2115
01:30:25,741 --> 01:30:28,001
That was neat. It was catchy.

2116
01:30:28,171 --> 01:30:30,411
Say great use of props.

2117
01:30:30,511 --> 01:30:32,211
Great use of your prop.

2118
01:30:32,411 --> 01:30:35,240
Of course, the glasses was such a moment.

2119
01:30:35,241 --> 01:30:39,681
The way you used the sunglasses, and that drew attention.

2120
01:30:39,881 --> 01:30:42,051
We were highly inspired.

2121
01:30:42,291 --> 01:30:43,951
We received a good response.

2122
01:30:44,051 --> 01:30:46,991
That's K-creativity.

2123
01:30:47,191 --> 01:30:49,230
I think ROYAL FAMILY is going to pick AG SQUAD.

2124
01:30:49,231 --> 01:30:50,860
We can pick AG SQUAD.

2125
01:30:50,861 --> 01:30:52,600
Why don't we just do AG SQUAD?

2126
01:30:52,601 --> 01:30:53,931
Because we can easily eat it up.

2127
01:30:54,431 --> 01:30:56,830
It shouldn't be AG SQUAD.

2128
01:30:56,831 --> 01:30:57,930
That'd be bad.

2129
01:30:57,931 --> 01:31:00,340
We're too small to keep up.

2130
01:31:00,341 --> 01:31:04,271
Our muscles can't keep up with that.

2131
01:31:04,541 --> 01:31:06,481
It's hard to catch up.

2132
01:31:07,781 --> 01:31:08,781
(I see.)

2133
01:31:08,782 --> 01:31:11,150
They're scared to do AG SQUAD stuff.

2134
01:31:11,151 --> 01:31:13,051
I think it's going to be BUMSUP.

2135
01:31:13,851 --> 01:31:16,821
To be the main dancer, we have to vote for BUMSUP.

2136
01:31:16,851 --> 01:31:19,820
If the goal is to be the main dancer...

2137
01:31:19,821 --> 01:31:20,991
BUMSUP.

2138
01:31:21,861 --> 01:31:23,531
- Bro.
- How was it?

2139
01:31:23,631 --> 01:31:25,900
No, how was... No.

2140
01:31:25,901 --> 01:31:27,430
We have to keep talking about it...

2141
01:31:27,431 --> 01:31:29,430
because no one can decide.

2142
01:31:29,431 --> 01:31:30,900
We haven't even decided.

2143
01:31:30,901 --> 01:31:34,171
It's between BUMSUP and AG SQUAD.

2144
01:31:34,301 --> 01:31:36,271
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

2145
01:31:36,871 --> 01:31:38,211
Are they picking the weakest?

2146
01:31:38,571 --> 01:31:40,910
Two Japanese crews chose Asia.

2147
01:31:40,911 --> 01:31:42,951
Whereas ROYAL FAMILY chose...

2148
01:31:43,311 --> 01:31:45,051
AG SQUAD.

2149
01:31:45,311 --> 01:31:48,251
When we voted, it was 2 to 2.

2150
01:31:48,351 --> 01:31:50,850
Both Japanese crews...

2151
01:31:50,851 --> 01:31:53,761
picked BUMSUP to be the main dancer.

2152
01:31:53,891 --> 01:31:57,461
Whereas for us and MOTIV, we suit AG SQUAD.

2153
01:31:57,791 --> 01:31:59,900
(MOTIVE, OSAKA Ojo Gang, RHTokyo, and ROYAL FAMILY are...)

2154
01:31:59,901 --> 01:32:01,001
(back in the fight zone.)

2155
01:32:01,301 --> 01:32:03,801
(The dancers from other classes are all present.)

2156
01:32:04,001 --> 01:32:07,470
Cast the vote on the choreography that you personally believe is best.

2157
01:32:07,471 --> 01:32:09,471
- You must vote for BUMSUP.
- Okay.

2158
01:32:09,641 --> 01:32:11,110
So when it comes to some of the things...

2159
01:32:11,111 --> 01:32:12,611
that you guys can finesse...

2160
01:32:13,041 --> 01:32:14,911
You get way more opportunities...

2161
01:32:15,281 --> 01:32:16,811
with AG SQUAD.

2162
01:32:17,151 --> 01:32:18,351
So we're still waiting.

2163
01:32:18,851 --> 01:32:21,350
We were pretty confident that we were going to win it today.

2164
01:32:21,351 --> 01:32:22,751
I guess it's taking time.

2165
01:32:22,991 --> 01:32:24,191
This is mine.

2166
01:32:24,321 --> 01:32:27,160
When AG SQUAD and BUMSUP arrive at the fight zone,

2167
01:32:27,161 --> 01:32:29,530
we'll start counting the votes.

2168
01:32:29,531 --> 01:32:30,531
(What's the result?)

2169
01:32:30,532 --> 01:32:32,061
Everyone looks anxious.

2170
01:32:32,801 --> 01:32:35,801
Vote will choose the choreography for middle class.

2171
01:32:36,531 --> 01:32:37,831
I have a very good feeling about it,

2172
01:32:37,901 --> 01:32:40,101
but I shouldn't let my guard down.

2173
01:32:40,641 --> 01:32:42,470
Nineteen for AG SQUAD.

2174
01:32:42,471 --> 01:32:43,871
(Out of 28 votes)

2175
01:32:44,111 --> 01:32:45,270
Yes.

2176
01:32:45,271 --> 01:32:47,211
(AG SQUAD's choreography is picked for the middle class.)

2177
01:32:48,741 --> 01:32:52,821
A good chance of winning the choreography from AG SQUAD.

2178
01:32:52,981 --> 01:32:56,290
It was nice as a team to just take a win today.

2179
01:32:56,291 --> 01:32:59,160
And just soak it up together as well.

2180
01:32:59,161 --> 01:33:00,961
It's okay. I can always steal it. It's fine.

2181
01:33:01,161 --> 01:33:03,560
- Let's steal it.
- I'm upset. I'm furious.

2182
01:33:03,561 --> 01:33:06,661
But there's no time to feel upset.

2183
01:33:06,731 --> 01:33:07,831
I have to steal it no matter what.

2184
01:33:08,331 --> 01:33:10,201
You know this isn't the end.

2185
01:33:10,401 --> 01:33:12,671
What matters now is to steal.

2186
01:33:12,741 --> 01:33:14,801
- Steal and secure.
- Secure it.

2187
01:33:15,001 --> 01:33:17,770
AG SQUAD just has a higher chance of getting picked. That's all.

2188
01:33:17,771 --> 01:33:19,440
Their choreography may have been picked today,

2189
01:33:19,441 --> 01:33:21,080
but if they're buried tomorrow,

2190
01:33:21,081 --> 01:33:22,211
they lose.

2191
01:33:22,411 --> 01:33:24,851
They think they can steal our choreography.

2192
01:33:25,281 --> 01:33:27,681
BUMSUP's choreography wasn't that strong.

2193
01:33:27,721 --> 01:33:30,221
(During the Choreography Selection for the rookie class)

2194
01:33:30,251 --> 01:33:31,451
So bad.

2195
01:33:31,721 --> 01:33:32,891
Which is all like...

2196
01:33:33,561 --> 01:33:34,961
There was something like this.

2197
01:33:35,161 --> 01:33:37,931
They are repetitive moves like this.

2198
01:33:38,261 --> 01:33:39,461
That's ragged.

2199
01:33:39,631 --> 01:33:41,561
But feel stupid for that.

2200
01:33:41,761 --> 01:33:43,300
It's annoying.

2201
01:33:43,301 --> 01:33:44,600
I don't want to lose.

2202
01:33:44,601 --> 01:33:46,100
I want to be the main dancer.

2203
01:33:46,101 --> 01:33:48,600
With BUMSUP's choreography, I can be the main dancer.

2204
01:33:48,601 --> 01:33:50,971
I'm excited to take on that choreo.

2205
01:33:51,071 --> 01:33:53,180
Now that this happened, I'm not going to lose it tomorrow.

2206
01:33:53,181 --> 01:33:54,211
No way.

2207
01:33:54,881 --> 01:33:56,650
We got to flip flop it.

2208
01:33:56,651 --> 01:33:58,751
For us to eat it...

2209
01:33:58,881 --> 01:34:00,221
Let's practice.

2210
01:34:01,251 --> 01:34:03,391
You guys did AG SQUAD.

2211
01:34:03,651 --> 01:34:04,990
We haven't won yet.

2212
01:34:04,991 --> 01:34:06,490
But that's a full-on day tomorrow.

2213
01:34:06,491 --> 01:34:07,521
We're going to win.

2214
01:34:07,791 --> 01:34:10,331
Obviously, everyone's scared of you guys.

2215
01:34:10,461 --> 01:34:12,560
We're going to steal it and be the main dancers.

2216
01:34:12,561 --> 01:34:14,801
You're familiar with the moves.

2217
01:34:15,231 --> 01:34:16,871
Similar vibes to us.

2218
01:34:17,071 --> 01:34:18,201
Easy.

2219
01:34:18,731 --> 01:34:21,600
We know that we can sell it with their choreography.

2220
01:34:21,601 --> 01:34:24,010
We're going to take their choreo and beat them.

2221
01:34:24,011 --> 01:34:26,540
Three of them on the floor, and they go...

2222
01:34:26,541 --> 01:34:27,911
But we can do that.

2223
01:34:28,111 --> 01:34:29,951
(They did this.)

2224
01:34:30,311 --> 01:34:32,621
Never die!

2225
01:34:32,751 --> 01:34:34,680
I mean they probably do want to beat us.

2226
01:34:34,681 --> 01:34:36,691
We're going to show them that we're better.

2227
01:34:36,921 --> 01:34:40,291
I get that everyone wants me to lose.

2228
01:34:40,561 --> 01:34:42,320
Because you're overwhelmingly good.

2229
01:34:42,321 --> 01:34:44,361
I can't lose in the Main Dancer Audition.

2230
01:34:44,491 --> 01:34:45,861
Let's be the main dancers.

2231
01:34:46,131 --> 01:34:48,060
Yes. I mean, obviously, if I do get to be the main dancer,

2232
01:34:48,061 --> 01:34:49,231
that means I'm in control.

2233
01:34:49,731 --> 01:34:52,900
That puts in me a better position in the competition.

2234
01:34:52,901 --> 01:34:55,001
So that's what I'm still going to go for.

2235
01:34:55,101 --> 01:34:56,711
I want to obviously win.

2236
01:34:56,911 --> 01:34:59,981
Grow some balls, right?

2237
01:35:00,181 --> 01:35:01,441
This is getting important now.

2238
01:35:01,681 --> 01:35:04,610
Since we didn't get picked, let's do our best.

2239
01:35:04,611 --> 01:35:06,550
It's turning on my battle mode.

(The one who has to guard)

2242
01:35:10,251 --> 01:35:13,660
It's inevitable that we'll be the main dancers.

2243
01:35:13,661 --> 01:35:15,990
You don't want to give it to them, right? No.

2244
01:35:15,991 --> 01:35:17,531
It'll be hard to become the main dancer.

2245
01:35:17,731 --> 01:35:18,931
(The one who tries to steal)

2246
01:35:19,161 --> 01:35:20,830
Let's totally steal it.

2247
01:35:20,831 --> 01:35:22,800
- It's easy.
- We're ready to eat.

2248
01:35:22,801 --> 01:35:24,300
We have a chance.

Trying to knock out Rie.

2250
01:35:26,001 --> 01:35:27,841

After seeing AG SQUAD, it was like...

2265
01:35:56,131 --> 01:35:58,601
I feel like each crew was just so focused...

2266
01:35:58,701 --> 01:36:01,141
on getting the choreography right.

But I'm going to do my best on my life.

2274

- Who?
- Them.

- Just...

01:37:11,541 --> 01:37:14,740
Hyojin Choi and Lip J must be relaxed.

2301
01:37:14,741 --> 01:37:15,810
We have to guard it.

2302
01:37:15,811 --> 01:37:17,150
(BUMSUP's rookie class, Lip J, Hyojin Choi)

2303
01:37:17,151 --> 01:37:18,551
We can never let them take it.

2304
01:37:18,851 --> 01:37:19,880
(How dare they?)

2305
01:37:19,881 --> 01:37:22,521
But for someone who has to steal it,

2306
01:37:23,121 --> 01:37:24,921
they become spiteful.

2307
01:37:25,691 --> 01:37:29,121
(3 fight judges enter the fight zone with tension.)

2308
01:37:29,691 --> 01:37:32,391
Today's a really big day.

2309
01:37:32,561 --> 01:37:34,360
Pressure's on, but good luck to...

2310
01:37:34,361 --> 01:37:35,931
all of you to kill it.

2311
01:37:36,671 --> 01:37:38,401
We have to do the most.

2312
01:37:39,801 --> 01:37:40,941
First up is...

2313
01:37:41,301 --> 01:37:42,711
the rookie class.

2314
01:37:42,771 --> 01:37:44,371
Let's go!

2315
01:37:44,771 --> 01:37:47,241
Go, Kylie. You look good.

2316
01:37:48,781 --> 01:37:50,380
Rico and Reina's dance.

2317
01:37:50,381 --> 01:37:51,451
We'll do our best.

2318
01:37:51,511 --> 01:37:53,250
- Let's go. You got it.
- Let's go.

2319
01:37:53,251 --> 01:37:54,851
You can do it.

2320
01:37:55,451 --> 01:37:56,591
See you.

2321
01:37:57,291 --> 01:37:59,561
I feel confident about becoming the main dancer.

2322
01:37:59,991 --> 01:38:03,291
I'm confident in being able to be the main dancer.

2323
01:38:03,891 --> 01:38:07,000
Aaliyah and I are going to be the main dancers for the rookie class.

2324
01:38:07,001 --> 01:38:08,101
We'll take it.

2325
01:38:08,701 --> 01:38:11,501
Me and Kylie were very confident.

2326
01:38:11,931 --> 01:38:13,771
I'm sure we'll become the main dancers for sure.

2327
01:38:14,671 --> 01:38:18,241
I'll bring the main dancer position.

2328
01:38:18,871 --> 01:38:20,040
Lip J.

2329
01:38:20,041 --> 01:38:21,481
Among these crews,

2330
01:38:22,241 --> 01:38:25,281
which one do you think is your number one rival?

2331
01:38:26,181 --> 01:38:27,181
None.

2332
01:38:28,621 --> 01:38:29,751
Okay then.

2333
01:38:30,251 --> 01:38:31,421
(Glancing over)

2334
01:38:31,791 --> 01:38:33,221
(That's funny.)

2335
01:38:33,421 --> 01:38:36,391
As the maker of this choreography, what do you want to say...

2336
01:38:36,491 --> 01:38:37,531
to the other five teams?

2337
01:38:37,861 --> 01:38:39,501
I wish them good luck.

2338
01:38:39,861 --> 01:38:42,531
I think everyone will pull it off well,

2339
01:38:42,631 --> 01:38:44,001
but we won't let anyone take it.

2340
01:38:44,501 --> 01:38:45,970
- We need to work really hard.
- I won't let anyone take it.

2341
01:38:45,971 --> 01:38:47,200
- Seriously.
- I won't let anyone do it.

2342
01:38:47,201 --> 01:38:49,510
I told them that the choreography was easy.

2343
01:38:49,511 --> 01:38:51,440
But to be honest, it isn't easy.

2344
01:38:51,441 --> 01:38:53,240
They'll become flustered...

2345
01:38:53,241 --> 01:38:54,711
when we teach them the choreography later on.

2346
01:38:54,941 --> 01:38:56,611
- It isn't easy.
- Not at all.

2347
01:38:57,111 --> 01:38:58,381
It isn't easy at all.

2348
01:38:58,981 --> 01:39:03,420
Once you begin the choreography, you connect the movements nonstop.

2349
01:39:03,421 --> 01:39:06,261
So if you miss one movement, you can't go back.

2350
01:39:07,161 --> 01:39:08,991
- Shall I count? Okay.
- Yes.

2351
01:39:11,531 --> 01:39:13,131
That transition is tricky.

2352
01:39:13,231 --> 01:39:16,061
Like the step that comes in front of this.

2353
01:39:16,331 --> 01:39:17,331
I know.

2354
01:39:18,601 --> 01:39:20,241
I could see that they were struggling.

2355
01:39:20,341 --> 01:39:21,341
It made me happy.

2356
01:39:24,741 --> 01:39:25,741
I messed up.

2357
01:39:26,381 --> 01:39:27,481
I don't know which way it is.

2358
01:39:28,311 --> 01:39:30,081
(Am I doing it right?)

2359
01:39:30,651 --> 01:39:31,881
How did the hands go?

2360
01:39:33,721 --> 01:39:34,721
I can't memorize it.

2361
01:39:38,191 --> 01:39:40,860
There were many dance moves we could follow easily,

2362
01:39:40,861 --> 01:39:41,891
so it was nice.

2363
01:39:42,891 --> 01:39:44,631
All of us tried the choreography as a group.

2364
01:39:44,731 --> 01:39:46,261
Our version was the best.

2365
01:39:48,331 --> 01:39:49,401
That's awkward.

2366
01:39:49,631 --> 01:39:50,671
Yes.

2367
01:39:51,501 --> 01:39:53,671
This choreography is a lot of work.

2368
01:39:54,001 --> 01:39:56,640
It was a difficult choreography.

2369
01:39:56,641 --> 01:39:59,241
Can you guys pick up BUMSUP's choreography in a day?

2370
01:39:59,341 --> 01:40:00,611
- Oh, yes.
- Yes.

2371
01:40:01,041 --> 01:40:02,311
It's just annoying.

2372
01:40:02,681 --> 01:40:06,051
AG SQUAD was being so dumb.

2373
01:40:06,481 --> 01:40:07,581
Now we're doing BUMSUP's choreography.

2374
01:40:07,881 --> 01:40:09,081
I'm getting tense.

2375
01:40:10,221 --> 01:40:11,221
It's good.

2376
01:40:11,222 --> 01:40:12,251
(Glancing over)

2377
01:40:12,421 --> 01:40:13,561
It's a good dance.

2378
01:40:14,121 --> 01:40:17,661
(AG SQUAD's Vanessa and Aaliyah practice without a problem.)

2379
01:40:18,261 --> 01:40:21,561
The choreography was quite easy to pick up.

2380
01:40:23,071 --> 01:40:25,331
(Good teamwork)

2381
01:40:27,501 --> 01:40:29,101
We're good at the Korean style.

2382
01:40:29,201 --> 01:40:31,371
We're probably one of the cleanest crews.

2383
01:40:31,441 --> 01:40:33,040
That's what makes you stand out.

2384
01:40:33,041 --> 01:40:35,510
You use choreography, and you make it look good on you.

2385
01:40:35,511 --> 01:40:36,681
Absolutely.

2386
01:40:37,281 --> 01:40:38,751
It'll just be ours.

2387
01:40:40,221 --> 01:40:41,881
AG SQUAD and RHTokyo.

2388
01:40:42,281 --> 01:40:45,391
They learned the choreography in a short amount of time,

2389
01:40:45,491 --> 01:40:46,491
so I became nervous.

2390
01:40:46,821 --> 01:40:50,431
But their expressions won't be as good as ours.

2391
01:40:51,261 --> 01:40:52,631
Let the battle begin.

2392
01:40:53,301 --> 01:40:55,460
We have full adrenaline. We can win.

2393
01:40:55,461 --> 01:40:57,801
I'm confident I'm not scared.

2394
01:40:58,231 --> 01:40:59,401
- Ready?
- Let's go!

2395
01:40:59,671 --> 01:41:00,970
Let's go!

2396
01:41:00,971 --> 01:41:02,440
(Nervous)

2397
01:41:02,441 --> 01:41:03,911
Let's go!

2398
01:41:04,511 --> 01:41:06,210
- Fight!
- Come on!

2399
01:41:06,211 --> 01:41:07,681
(The first group begins for the Main Dancer Audition.)

2400
01:41:07,781 --> 01:41:09,481
(AG SQUAD's Vanessa and Aaliyah versus MOTIV's Kaidi and Abby)

2401
01:41:19,991 --> 01:41:21,091
(At that moment)

2402
01:41:23,231 --> 01:41:24,231
She messed up just now.

2403
01:41:24,391 --> 01:41:25,430
It's over.

2404
01:41:25,431 --> 01:41:27,061
(His hawk mode is on.)

2405
01:41:27,361 --> 01:41:30,301
So if you miss one movement, you can't go back.

2406
01:41:30,431 --> 01:41:31,671
Keep going.

2407
01:41:33,441 --> 01:41:35,300
(Vanessa quickly gets back on her track.)

2408
01:41:35,301 --> 01:41:37,641
She came back to her senses and kept going.

2409
01:41:38,471 --> 01:41:39,710
(Well done! Keep going!)

2410
01:41:39,711 --> 01:41:40,841
Let's go!

2411
01:41:41,741 --> 01:41:43,051
The two of them are good.

2412
01:41:43,151 --> 01:41:46,081
Both of them are good. Vanessa is really good.

2413
01:41:46,181 --> 01:41:47,521
Keep going!

2414
01:41:48,351 --> 01:41:49,481
Let's go!

2415
01:41:51,991 --> 01:41:54,721
I could possibly save the mistake I made.

2416
01:41:55,821 --> 01:41:57,461
That's good.

2417
01:41:58,091 --> 01:41:59,701
We should really watch out for these guys.

2418
01:42:00,001 --> 01:42:02,131
They have no power. Like, they have no power.

2419
01:42:02,231 --> 01:42:04,471
Their dance lacked energy.

2420
01:42:04,571 --> 01:42:06,101
(Nervous)

2421
01:42:08,201 --> 01:42:09,241
Kaidi!

2422
01:42:10,471 --> 01:42:11,641
Yes!

2423
01:42:12,571 --> 01:42:14,381
That was so good, ladies.

2424
01:42:16,141 --> 01:42:17,780
Let's go!

2425
01:42:17,781 --> 01:42:19,650
(The first group's Main Dancer Audition ends.)

2426
01:42:19,651 --> 01:42:22,181
But their expressions won't be as good as ours.

2427
01:42:22,281 --> 01:42:23,720
Let's go!

2428
01:42:23,721 --> 01:42:25,620
We weren't nervous at all.

2429
01:42:25,621 --> 01:42:28,091
- Let's go!
- Uwa and I are strong.

2430
01:42:28,761 --> 01:42:29,890
Good luck!

2431
01:42:29,891 --> 01:42:31,791
(Focused)

2432
01:42:31,931 --> 01:42:34,001
(The second group begins for the Main Dancer Audition.)

2433
01:42:34,201 --> 01:42:35,500
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's Junna and Uwa...)

2434
01:42:35,501 --> 01:42:36,771
(versus BUMSUP's Lip J and Hyojin Choi)

2435
01:42:37,001 --> 01:42:38,901
- Hey.
- Hey.

2436
01:42:41,341 --> 01:42:42,341
Hey.

2437
01:42:42,701 --> 01:42:44,411
We can't lose in this round.

2438
01:42:44,771 --> 01:42:48,211
We danced as if we were charming everyone.

2439
01:42:48,781 --> 01:42:50,481
- Yes!
- Let's go!

2440
01:42:50,851 --> 01:42:54,281
The vibe of the music goes better with our colors.

2441
01:42:55,851 --> 01:42:56,921
(They're good.)

2442
01:43:03,491 --> 01:43:06,661
I think BUMSUP is more synchronized than OSAKA Ojo Gang.

2443
01:43:07,131 --> 01:43:08,131
That's about it.

2444
01:43:09,931 --> 01:43:12,200
- They're very clean, BUMSUP.
- Yes.

2445
01:43:12,201 --> 01:43:14,271
Maybe the judges will like the clean version better.

2446
01:43:14,471 --> 01:43:15,471
How refreshing.

2447
01:43:16,641 --> 01:43:17,641
They don't match.

2448
01:43:18,111 --> 01:43:19,681
- They're just not clean.
- Yes.

2449
01:43:21,141 --> 01:43:22,480
We weren't worried about them.

2450
01:43:22,481 --> 01:43:23,610
You can do more!

2451
01:43:23,611 --> 01:43:24,751
Junna!

2452
01:43:27,321 --> 01:43:30,821
BUMSUP was a strong opponent, but we weren't scared at all.

2453
01:43:31,521 --> 01:43:32,521
We're ruined.

2454
01:43:32,891 --> 01:43:33,921
That's bad.

2455
01:43:34,661 --> 01:43:36,531
(OSAKA Ojo Gang missed the hand-holding movement.)

2456
01:43:37,691 --> 01:43:38,691
(Checking)

2457
01:43:40,761 --> 01:43:43,531
(The second group's Main Dancer Audition ends.)

2458
01:43:43,671 --> 01:43:45,270
- They're good.
- They're good.

2459
01:43:45,271 --> 01:43:47,171
Relax.

2460
01:43:47,271 --> 01:43:48,770
It's okay.

2461
01:43:48,771 --> 01:43:50,240
Let's go.

2462
01:43:50,241 --> 01:43:51,471
Enjoy it!

2463
01:43:52,641 --> 01:43:54,380
We're aiming to win for all three classes.

2464
01:43:54,381 --> 01:43:56,781
We'll take BUMSUP's choreography.

2465
01:43:57,181 --> 01:44:00,320
RHTokyo, AG SQUAD, and BUMSUP.

2466
01:44:00,321 --> 01:44:02,551
We weren't worried about any one of them.

2467
01:44:02,851 --> 01:44:04,191
Girls, just have fun.

2468
01:44:05,091 --> 01:44:06,821
(The judging mode is on.)

2469
01:44:07,421 --> 01:44:09,661
(The third group for the Main Dancer Audition)

2470
01:44:12,931 --> 01:44:14,300
(What a nice start!)

2471
01:44:14,301 --> 01:44:15,301
Yes.

2472
01:44:15,301 --> 01:44:16,301
(RHTokyo's Reina and Rico Hirai...)

2473
01:44:16,301 --> 01:44:17,301
(versus ROYAL FAMILY's Maiya and Kylie)

2474
01:44:19,001 --> 01:44:20,941
- Come on!
- That's cool!

2475
01:44:22,001 --> 01:44:24,011
No way. The energy is insane.

2476
01:44:28,481 --> 01:44:30,051
It's time to show them what we have.

2477
01:44:32,281 --> 01:44:33,321
They were very synchronized.

2478
01:44:35,981 --> 01:44:37,421
RHTokyo has so much power.

2479
01:44:37,921 --> 01:44:42,121
RHTokyo is the crew that's more on our level.

2480
01:44:43,331 --> 01:44:44,991
If they start doing it like that,

2481
01:44:45,131 --> 01:44:47,231
let's try to do it even better.

2482
01:44:47,961 --> 01:44:49,001
They're too angry.

2483
01:44:49,301 --> 01:44:50,301
(An angry facial expression?)

2484
01:44:50,731 --> 01:44:51,771
Smile!

2485
01:44:52,201 --> 01:44:53,201
Smile!

2486
01:44:55,801 --> 01:44:57,271
Their mood is off.

2487
01:44:57,911 --> 01:44:59,471
It was a bit too much.

2488
01:45:01,381 --> 01:45:04,211
The chill atmosphere and pretty moments...

2489
01:45:04,311 --> 01:45:06,051
didn't come out very well.

2490
01:45:06,451 --> 01:45:07,521
You need to enjoy it!

2491
01:45:07,721 --> 01:45:11,421
(RHTokyo and ROYAL FAMILY focused more on the powerful energy.)

2492
01:45:17,931 --> 01:45:20,431
- Yes!
- Oh, my gosh.

2493
01:45:21,801 --> 01:45:23,801
(They did well.)

2494
01:45:24,001 --> 01:45:26,001
- Good job.
- Good job, girls.

2495
01:45:26,971 --> 01:45:29,071
Hyojin, that was insane.

2496
01:45:29,401 --> 01:45:31,971
- You all did so well.
- Yes.

2497
01:45:32,241 --> 01:45:35,181
I just want to say this to Lip J and Hyojin Choi.

2498
01:45:35,811 --> 01:45:37,181
I love this choreography.

2499
01:45:37,281 --> 01:45:39,681
I feel like you guys did an amazing job at storytelling.

2500
01:45:41,081 --> 01:45:42,081
Thank you,

2501
01:45:42,321 --> 01:45:44,750
There were lots of highs and lows. The energy...

2502
01:45:44,751 --> 01:45:46,220
was sometimes chill and sometimes fun.

2503
01:45:46,221 --> 01:45:49,990
Then suddenly... Line, lines, lines. So, there were a lot of contrasts.

2504
01:45:49,991 --> 01:45:51,931
So, great job.

2505
01:45:52,131 --> 01:45:53,801
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

2506
01:45:53,931 --> 01:45:55,430
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2507
01:45:55,431 --> 01:45:56,570
ROYAL FAMILY crew.

2508
01:45:56,571 --> 01:46:00,501
You guys are known for that attack.

2509
01:46:00,841 --> 01:46:02,140
This song doesn't give an attack.

2510
01:46:02,141 --> 01:46:04,441
It gives...

2511
01:46:04,541 --> 01:46:06,471
Do you know what I'm saying? It gives, cutesy.

2512
01:46:06,581 --> 01:46:07,910
And I think... ROYAL FAMILY,

2513
01:46:07,911 --> 01:46:09,280
sometimes, you guys can come off a little too like,

2514
01:46:09,281 --> 01:46:10,711
"Ah!" Too scary.

2515
01:46:10,911 --> 01:46:13,651
That's right. The concept is important.

2516
01:46:13,821 --> 01:46:17,121
Me and Kylie were quite disappointed.

2517
01:46:17,391 --> 01:46:18,591
Vanessa and Aaliyah.

2518
01:46:18,891 --> 01:46:20,891
(Nervous)

2519
01:46:21,621 --> 01:46:24,960
You guys almost pulled off the best performance.

2520
01:46:24,961 --> 01:46:26,601
They did well. They did really well.

2521
01:46:26,701 --> 01:46:28,361
But...

2522
01:46:29,761 --> 01:46:30,770
Vanessa?

2523
01:46:30,771 --> 01:46:31,771
(Startled)

2524
01:46:32,471 --> 01:46:34,001
Did you miss a couple of choreographies?

2525
01:46:34,571 --> 01:46:36,241
I did miss some. Yes.

2526
01:46:37,641 --> 01:46:40,081
(Vanessa made a mistake with the choreography.)

2527
01:46:40,681 --> 01:46:42,080
We have to be fair.

2528
01:46:42,081 --> 01:46:43,911
Forgetting choreography matters.

2529
01:46:44,211 --> 01:46:45,981
Guys, it matters. Okay?

2530
01:46:46,721 --> 01:46:48,980
First thing is, I feel bad.

2531
01:46:48,981 --> 01:46:51,350
My mistake isn't just on my shoulders.

2532
01:46:51,351 --> 01:46:52,691
It's on hers as well.

2533
01:46:52,951 --> 01:46:56,290
RHTokyo. Regarding the precision, I think...

2534
01:46:56,291 --> 01:46:57,991
RHTokyo was the best.

2535
01:46:58,091 --> 01:46:59,831
- Thank you.
- However...

2536
01:47:01,401 --> 01:47:02,860
But your energy...

2537
01:47:02,861 --> 01:47:05,970
When you overexpress yourself, you kind of leave the routine.

2538
01:47:05,971 --> 01:47:08,301
The emotions kind of didn't match the song.

2539
01:47:08,401 --> 01:47:10,010
(RHTokyo's excessive energy hurt them.)

2540
01:47:10,011 --> 01:47:13,341
He's so thorough with his judgment this time.

2541
01:47:13,611 --> 01:47:16,081
I didn't feel like it was going in a good direction,

2542
01:47:16,181 --> 01:47:18,111
so I felt nervous.

2543
01:47:18,211 --> 01:47:20,850
They're looking for an embodiment of the song.

2544
01:47:20,851 --> 01:47:23,490
Even though it's aggressive, you kind of need to have balance.

2545
01:47:23,491 --> 01:47:25,590
So it's like, "Ah. But I'm going to eat you."

2546
01:47:25,591 --> 01:47:27,490
But I'm like, "Ah." But I'm... You know.

2547
01:47:27,491 --> 01:47:28,861
(Okay. I got it.)

2548
01:47:29,291 --> 01:47:31,590
Lip J and Hyojin Choi, stay on your toes. You never know.

2549
01:47:31,591 --> 01:47:33,161
You might get asked to dance again. It isn't over yet.

2550
01:47:33,461 --> 01:47:35,361
Will they pick people who'll compete against us?

2551
01:47:35,731 --> 01:47:38,831
To be honest, I think we'll get chosen.

2552
01:47:39,431 --> 01:47:41,300
I messed up that one. Yes.

2553
01:47:41,301 --> 01:47:43,101
But if they're willing to give us a chance...

2554
01:47:43,271 --> 01:47:44,510
Let's go from the best.

2555
01:47:44,511 --> 01:47:46,071
Who did you like the most?

2556
01:47:46,681 --> 01:47:49,041
- I liked...
- Yes. They stood out.

2557
01:47:49,441 --> 01:47:52,050
Who's worth giving a chance to battle...

2558
01:47:52,051 --> 01:47:53,051
- That's the question.
- Yes.

2559
01:47:53,052 --> 01:47:54,220
I think, for sure...

2560
01:47:54,221 --> 01:47:55,680
- When you look at how they do it...
- That was...

2561
01:47:55,681 --> 01:47:58,590
"Yes, that's the vibe!" It's really nice and clean.

2562
01:47:58,591 --> 01:47:59,991
Yes. I think they were the cleanest.

2563
01:48:00,121 --> 01:48:03,691
Okay. So then... If it's between... What do you guys think?

2564
01:48:04,931 --> 01:48:06,531
They did not stand out to me at all.

2565
01:48:07,461 --> 01:48:09,601
(Which crew will become the rookie class' main dancer?)

2566
01:48:09,831 --> 01:48:13,971
The judges had a discussion after the match...

2567
01:48:14,071 --> 01:48:16,441
and decided to check out two teams again.

2568
01:48:16,541 --> 01:48:18,071
See? I knew that they'd need to dance again.

2569
01:48:20,981 --> 01:48:24,350
I'm trying my best to express how bad...

2570
01:48:24,351 --> 01:48:28,150
I want to have another chance to prove myself.

2571
01:48:28,151 --> 01:48:30,820
I think our energy was the best.

2572
01:48:30,821 --> 01:48:34,420
So I think RHTokyo would be selected.

2573
01:48:34,421 --> 01:48:35,821
If BUMSUP isn't there,

2574
01:48:36,931 --> 01:48:38,661
it would be a big shame.

2575
01:48:38,891 --> 01:48:39,891
It is...

2576
01:48:41,201 --> 01:48:42,201
Please.

2577
01:48:42,202 --> 01:48:43,800
I don't know which crew would be selected.

2578
01:48:43,801 --> 01:48:45,430
It's so hard to predict.

2579
01:48:45,431 --> 01:48:46,431
It's really thrilling.

2580
01:48:46,631 --> 01:48:48,201
(Which crew will be the first to head to the final audition?)

2581
01:48:48,801 --> 01:48:50,710
BUMSUP...

2582
01:48:50,711 --> 01:48:51,711
Yes!

2583
01:48:52,211 --> 01:48:53,911
- BUMSUP.
- Yes.

2584
01:48:55,281 --> 01:48:56,281
and...

2585
01:48:56,811 --> 01:48:58,451
(Please. Just once.)

2586
01:48:58,551 --> 01:48:59,610
Can I go again?

2587
01:48:59,611 --> 01:49:00,950
Can I go just one more time?

2588
01:49:00,951 --> 01:49:03,921
(Which crew will be on the final audition?)

2589
01:49:05,351 --> 01:49:06,351
And AG SQUAD.

2590
01:49:06,352 --> 01:49:07,360
(AG SQUAD's Vanessa and Aaliyah)

2591
01:49:07,361 --> 01:49:08,991
Thank you.

2592
01:49:10,731 --> 01:49:11,960
(Well done.)

2593
01:49:11,961 --> 01:49:14,231
Let's go!

2594
01:49:14,401 --> 01:49:15,401
AG SQUAD.

2595
01:49:15,431 --> 01:49:16,931
RHTokyo was dropped?

2596
01:49:17,431 --> 01:49:19,431
(They're disappointed.)

2597
01:49:19,701 --> 01:49:20,801
Okay. Vanessa.

2598
01:49:20,901 --> 01:49:25,610
You put yourself into a very dire situation...

2599
01:49:25,611 --> 01:49:27,810
by missing the choreography,

2600
01:49:27,811 --> 01:49:30,751
but it's how you recovered it and bounced back.

2601
01:49:31,211 --> 01:49:33,111
When you miss one,

2602
01:49:33,381 --> 01:49:34,621
you normally can't go back.

2603
01:49:35,221 --> 01:49:36,991
This has never happened. Why now?

2604
01:49:39,121 --> 01:49:42,121
But that's not me, giving up just because I made a mistake.

2605
01:49:42,521 --> 01:49:44,931
She pulled herself back and continued right away.

2606
01:49:45,091 --> 01:49:47,200
You can panic sometimes when you forget something.

2607
01:49:47,201 --> 01:49:48,900
You can panic, but...

2608
01:49:48,901 --> 01:49:51,800
And then I crossed it out and said, "Okay, she finished off strong."

2609
01:49:51,801 --> 01:49:53,330
A way to redeem yourself.

2610
01:49:53,331 --> 01:49:54,771
Thank you.

2611
01:49:55,371 --> 01:49:57,211
Gosh. Redemption.

2612
01:49:57,641 --> 01:49:58,970
(Clapping)

2613
01:49:58,971 --> 01:50:00,681
Amazing girls.

2614
01:50:00,881 --> 01:50:03,081
We'll see it just once this time...

2615
01:50:03,511 --> 01:50:05,081
and make the final selection.

2616
01:50:05,451 --> 01:50:06,751
Let's go.

2617
01:50:07,151 --> 01:50:08,551
Let's go!

2618
01:50:08,721 --> 01:50:12,520
We can execute BUMSUP's routine better than BUMSUP.

2619
01:50:12,521 --> 01:50:14,790
We will be the main dancers.

2620
01:50:14,791 --> 01:50:17,890
You would think you could steal our choreography,

2621
01:50:17,891 --> 01:50:19,590
but you'd be ashamed.

2622
01:50:19,591 --> 01:50:22,060
- Let's go.
- Let's go. We trust you.

2623
01:50:22,061 --> 01:50:23,801
Let's go!

2624
01:50:24,431 --> 01:50:25,431
Ready?

2625
01:50:25,501 --> 01:50:27,270
They've got the movement quality,

2626
01:50:27,271 --> 01:50:28,841
and they've got the performance.

2627
01:50:29,371 --> 01:50:30,371
Fight!

2628
01:50:30,971 --> 01:50:34,481
(Vanessa and Aaliyah versus Lip J and Hyojin Choi)

2629
01:50:42,121 --> 01:50:43,121
They're killing it.

2630
01:50:43,621 --> 01:50:44,621
I can't lie.

2631
01:50:44,791 --> 01:50:47,091
I didn't find anyone intimidating.

2632
01:50:48,321 --> 01:50:51,191
It almost feels like the song was meant for them.

2633
01:50:52,061 --> 01:50:53,061
Let's go!

2634
01:50:57,301 --> 01:50:58,501
I don't know which one.

2635
01:51:00,701 --> 01:51:01,871
I don't know!

2636
01:51:02,001 --> 01:51:03,971
I should show them as a dancer...

2637
01:51:04,011 --> 01:51:06,271
and make it so people can't take their eyes off of me.

2638
01:51:06,541 --> 01:51:07,981
Let's go!

2639
01:51:08,611 --> 01:51:10,351
Keep going. Very good.

2640
01:51:10,551 --> 01:51:12,211
(Amazed)

2641
01:51:12,711 --> 01:51:14,620
Our bodies have adapted.

2642
01:51:14,621 --> 01:51:16,821
It looks like it's our choreography.

2643
01:51:17,551 --> 01:51:19,420
That was perfect.

2644
01:51:19,421 --> 01:51:20,490
Keep on performing!

2645
01:51:20,491 --> 01:51:21,591
Let's go!

2646
01:51:22,961 --> 01:51:25,630
Wouldn't it be amazing if AG won it?

2647
01:51:25,631 --> 01:51:28,000
Still. I think BUMSUP will win.

2648
01:51:28,001 --> 01:51:29,460
This is a fight.

2649
01:51:29,461 --> 01:51:30,471
Good!

2650
01:51:31,001 --> 01:51:32,601
Goodness!

2651
01:51:38,441 --> 01:51:42,041
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

2652
01:51:42,341 --> 01:51:44,081
(Screaming)

2653
01:51:44,251 --> 01:51:46,411
You did so well.

2654
01:51:48,921 --> 01:51:49,981
Well done.

2655
01:51:50,821 --> 01:51:52,490
(They nailed it.)

2656
01:51:52,491 --> 01:51:54,591
- Quality.
- Quality.

2657
01:51:55,091 --> 01:51:56,521
(Holding hands)

2658
01:51:57,131 --> 01:51:59,060
(The judges are in a panic.)

2659
01:51:59,061 --> 01:52:01,430
Goodness.

2660
01:52:01,431 --> 01:52:03,801
(How am I going to choose?)

2661
01:52:04,001 --> 01:52:05,271
This is difficult.

2662
01:52:05,531 --> 01:52:06,671
Who do you think is going to win?

2663
01:52:07,241 --> 01:52:08,940
AG SQUAD just killed that.

2664
01:52:08,941 --> 01:52:11,511
I got goosebumps.

2665
01:52:11,971 --> 01:52:13,610
I feel like I can still see it going to BUMSUP.

2666
01:52:13,611 --> 01:52:14,840
I was just going to say that.

2667
01:52:14,841 --> 01:52:18,051
They wouldn't take off Korea.

2668
01:52:18,811 --> 01:52:19,811
Okay.

2669
01:52:19,812 --> 01:52:22,981
I'll announce the main dancer for the rookie class.

2670
01:52:23,121 --> 01:52:25,420
I was specifically looking for performance.

2671
01:52:25,421 --> 01:52:27,691
"Who gives me main character?"

2672
01:52:27,991 --> 01:52:29,491
And right now, I think that's AG SQUAD.

2673
01:52:29,791 --> 01:52:30,930
Quality.

2674
01:52:30,931 --> 01:52:34,461
I think AG SQUAD gives me the main character's energy. Both of them.

2675
01:52:34,561 --> 01:52:36,560
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2676
01:52:36,561 --> 01:52:38,331
Experience and quality.

2677
01:52:39,471 --> 01:52:41,270
And I feel like the way that Team Korea...

2678
01:52:41,271 --> 01:52:43,370
constructed choreography...

2679
01:52:43,371 --> 01:52:45,770
Team Korea, I really feel the vocals.

2680
01:52:45,771 --> 01:52:47,740
You guys really bring out...

2681
01:52:47,741 --> 01:52:50,880
almost angelic womanly likeness to it.

2682
01:52:50,881 --> 01:52:52,650
Those are the kinds of things you would want to see...

2683
01:52:52,651 --> 01:52:53,920
from someone directing a video.

2684
01:52:53,921 --> 01:52:55,220
(The structure and expression stood out...)

2685
01:52:55,221 --> 01:52:56,421
(from Lip J and Hyojin Choi.)

2686
01:52:56,481 --> 01:52:58,650
This is a close match.

2687
01:52:58,651 --> 01:53:01,520
It's hard to guess who they'll give it to.

2688
01:53:01,521 --> 01:53:04,161
The main dancer of the rookie class we selected...

2689
01:53:04,361 --> 01:53:05,661
I'm nervous.

2690
01:53:05,991 --> 01:53:07,460
- BUMSUP.
- Please.

2691
01:53:07,461 --> 01:53:08,901
(BUMSUP? AG SQUAD?)

2692
01:53:09,201 --> 01:53:11,201
I'm just waiting to hear AG SQUAD.

2693
01:53:12,531 --> 01:53:14,001
This has to work.

2694
01:53:14,601 --> 01:53:17,210
The main dancer of the rookie class we selected...

2695
01:53:17,211 --> 01:53:18,770
(Main dancer of the rookie class)

2696
01:53:18,771 --> 01:53:19,811
is AG SQUAD.

2697
01:53:20,681 --> 01:53:21,681
AG SQUAD.

2698
01:53:22,041 --> 01:53:23,140
Let's go!

2699
01:53:23,141 --> 01:53:25,451
Thank you.

2700
01:53:25,981 --> 01:53:27,651
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2701
01:53:27,981 --> 01:53:28,981
Thank you.

2702
01:53:28,982 --> 01:53:30,991
(You're the best, Vanessa and Aaliyah!)

2703
01:53:31,491 --> 01:53:32,550
Thank you.

2704
01:53:32,551 --> 01:53:34,561
(AG SQUAD took the first main dancer position.)

2705
01:53:34,661 --> 01:53:36,460
("All In AUS" by AG SQUAD)

2706
01:53:36,461 --> 01:53:39,431
Now it's your turn to take it.

2707
01:53:39,861 --> 01:53:40,861
You did it.

2708
01:53:40,931 --> 01:53:42,261
I'm so happy.

2709
01:53:42,531 --> 01:53:44,231
We made sure we won in the end.

2710
01:53:44,431 --> 01:53:47,871
I'm so excited to show the world what we're capable of.

2711
01:53:49,101 --> 01:53:50,671
They said, "snatch!"

2712
01:53:52,041 --> 01:53:53,570
Well done.

2713
01:53:53,571 --> 01:53:55,310
- Well done.
- Well done.

2714
01:53:55,311 --> 01:53:57,081
- Well done.
- You didn't do bad.

2715
01:53:57,551 --> 01:53:58,850
You really did well.

2716
01:53:58,851 --> 01:54:00,550
You did so well.

2717
01:54:00,551 --> 01:54:02,680
You're not in 2nd place. You're in 1.5th place.

2718
01:54:02,681 --> 01:54:03,891
It was so close.

2719
01:54:04,221 --> 01:54:06,751
I lost it to Rian in Season 1.

2720
01:54:07,121 --> 01:54:08,860
I failed to dance as a main dancer.

2721
01:54:08,861 --> 01:54:10,561
It felt like the same thing was happening again.

2722
01:54:11,731 --> 01:54:12,931
It was a shame.

2723
01:54:15,661 --> 01:54:17,231
Can I say one thing?

2724
01:54:18,531 --> 01:54:19,531
(What?)

2725
01:54:21,201 --> 01:54:22,800
(What is it?)

2726
01:54:22,801 --> 01:54:24,210
(What's going on?)

2727
01:54:24,211 --> 01:54:25,910
Before, at the interview,

2728
01:54:25,911 --> 01:54:28,611
I said that there was no competition.

2729
01:54:29,141 --> 01:54:30,811
- Lip J.
- Yes?

2730
01:54:31,181 --> 01:54:34,281
Who do you think is your rival for the first place?

2731
01:54:34,951 --> 01:54:35,951
None.

2732
01:54:37,451 --> 01:54:39,490
I said that because...

2733
01:54:39,491 --> 01:54:41,961
(Feeling nervous)

2734
01:54:42,091 --> 01:54:44,261
I was so nervous, and this is a competition.

2735
01:54:44,591 --> 01:54:47,431
I was like, this was a real rival moment.

2736
01:54:48,901 --> 01:54:51,000
This was a real rival moment.

2737
01:54:51,001 --> 01:54:52,400
I thought like that.

2738
01:54:52,401 --> 01:54:53,940
And now it has become real.

2739
01:54:53,941 --> 01:54:57,410
I really appreciate that you guys made this choreography shine,

2740
01:54:57,411 --> 01:54:59,540
and I'm really looking forward to working with you.

2741
01:54:59,541 --> 01:55:01,581
Thank you so much.

2742
01:55:02,741 --> 01:55:05,480
(They may be rivals)

2743
01:55:05,481 --> 01:55:06,550
They did perform well.

2744
01:55:06,551 --> 01:55:08,050
You did well, and they did well.

2745
01:55:08,051 --> 01:55:09,981
You did well.

2746
01:55:10,391 --> 01:55:11,850
It wasn't just a battle.

2747
01:55:11,851 --> 01:55:14,990
It was a competition where you could learn.

2748
01:55:14,991 --> 01:55:17,990
With AG SQUAD,

2749
01:55:17,991 --> 01:55:21,001
when we first gathered to select the choreography,

2750
01:55:21,331 --> 01:55:23,400
I could feel...

2751
01:55:23,401 --> 01:55:26,800
like they really thought about the essence of this mission.

2752
01:55:26,801 --> 01:55:28,400
I think it gets more exciting...

2753
01:55:28,401 --> 01:55:31,540
to compete with people I could learn a lot from.

2754
01:55:31,541 --> 01:55:32,541
I'm so happy.

2755
01:55:32,542 --> 01:55:34,980
She's a really great dancer...

2756
01:55:34,981 --> 01:55:37,480
with a great quality and vibe.

2757
01:55:37,481 --> 01:55:40,550
Very considerate, and we're very grateful.

2758
01:55:40,551 --> 01:55:43,220
(BUMSUP did their best in teaching the choreography...)

2759
01:55:43,221 --> 01:55:44,851
(to their rivals.)

2760
01:55:44,991 --> 01:55:46,490
We really appreciated that.

2761
01:55:46,491 --> 01:55:49,190
I'll keep this noted that the Korean team was...

2762
01:55:49,191 --> 01:55:50,991
very nice with teaching us.

2763
01:55:51,391 --> 01:55:54,000
You know, we respect them as artists.

2764
01:55:54,001 --> 01:55:55,401
I'm very excited,

2765
01:55:55,931 --> 01:55:57,901
and I'm very happy about this mission.

2766
01:55:58,331 --> 01:55:59,470
From now on,

2767
01:55:59,471 --> 01:56:03,140
we'll start the main dancer audition for the middle class.

2768
01:56:03,141 --> 01:56:04,840
Both crews, please come to the stage.

2769
01:56:04,841 --> 01:56:05,871
Let's go!

2770
01:56:06,811 --> 01:56:09,210
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2771
01:56:09,211 --> 01:56:11,181
Let's go!

2772
01:56:11,481 --> 01:56:13,750
Let's go!

2773
01:56:13,751 --> 01:56:15,820
Let's go, BUMSUP!

2774
01:56:15,821 --> 01:56:17,650
- Go, girls.
- Come on.

2775
01:56:17,651 --> 01:56:18,821
(Moana, Isla, Zari, Harmz)

2776
01:56:18,921 --> 01:56:20,050
Come on, guys.

2777
01:56:20,051 --> 01:56:21,061
(Ruthy Baby, Kyra, Kaleece, Alysha)

2778
01:56:21,191 --> 01:56:23,760
Given it was our piece,

2779
01:56:23,761 --> 01:56:26,660
so we were pretty confident in our ability as a team.

2780
01:56:26,661 --> 01:56:28,660
We will become the main dancers.

2781
01:56:28,661 --> 01:56:31,870
We went there with the mindset that we couldn't lose.

2782
01:56:31,871 --> 01:56:34,371
We can take the main dance position.

2783
01:56:34,801 --> 01:56:36,570
The dancers of AG SQUAD whose choreography was chosen...

2784
01:56:36,571 --> 01:56:37,910
for the middle class,

2785
01:56:37,911 --> 01:56:39,341
please come forward to the stage.

2786
01:56:40,211 --> 01:56:41,740
Will they have an encore stage?

2787
01:56:41,741 --> 01:56:42,741
Will they show us?

2788
01:56:42,981 --> 01:56:45,881
The middle class dancers whose choreography wasn't chosen...

2789
01:56:46,281 --> 01:56:48,851
will watch AG SQUAD's choreography...

2790
01:56:49,181 --> 01:56:51,991
and begin matching the positions and start practicing.

2791
01:56:53,321 --> 01:56:55,061
It's about who will take what position.

2792
01:56:55,591 --> 01:56:57,231
(Everyone is given a position number.)

2793
01:56:57,461 --> 01:56:59,990
(1. Kyra, 2. Kaleece, 3. Ruthy Baby, 4. Alysha)

2794
01:56:59,991 --> 01:57:02,230
Do we get to choose what number we do?

2795
01:57:02,231 --> 01:57:04,501
We will see each person.

2796
01:57:04,731 --> 01:57:07,100
Who gets what part would be important.

2797
01:57:07,101 --> 01:57:08,371
It would be really important.

2798
01:57:08,801 --> 01:57:13,470
Choosing the positions was really important.

2799
01:57:13,471 --> 01:57:16,981
I thought I should steal it strategically.

2800
01:57:17,251 --> 01:57:19,880
It would feel more annoying to have your choreography stolen.

2801
01:57:19,881 --> 01:57:21,150
We are ready to eat,

2802
01:57:21,151 --> 01:57:22,921
so stay waiting, punks.

2803
01:57:24,851 --> 01:57:26,990
I don't really need to worry about anyone else.

2804
01:57:26,991 --> 01:57:28,461
We had to show them again.

2805
01:57:29,591 --> 01:57:33,561
I hope they strategically place their members to suit one's ability.

2806
01:57:34,661 --> 01:57:36,000
(They demonstrate for the position matching...)

2807
01:57:36,001 --> 01:57:37,201
(of the middle class.)

2808
01:57:38,401 --> 01:57:39,500
I'll steal that now.

2809
01:57:39,501 --> 01:57:40,841
I'm very confident.

2810
01:57:41,501 --> 01:57:44,470
(Ruthy Baby's solo part)

2811
01:57:44,471 --> 01:57:47,240
I thought I would be the best.

2812
01:57:47,241 --> 01:57:48,541
I really wanted to do it.

2813
01:57:48,811 --> 01:57:49,981
I could do well.

2814
01:57:50,341 --> 01:57:51,781
(1. Kyra)

2815
01:57:53,151 --> 01:57:54,520
The moves were very simple.

2816
01:57:54,521 --> 01:57:55,521
It was doable.

2817
01:57:55,951 --> 01:57:57,791
I was surprised that I could pick it up right away.

2818
01:57:58,751 --> 01:58:00,760
(Alysha's floor part)

2819
01:58:00,761 --> 01:58:02,121
She's always on the ground.

2820
01:58:02,661 --> 01:58:04,631
I can slide and slide.

2821
01:58:05,061 --> 01:58:06,330
She does a little slide.

2822
01:58:06,331 --> 01:58:08,231
That's why I thought that. She's on the floor.

2823
01:58:09,631 --> 01:58:11,631
(Kaleece's center position)

2824
01:58:11,871 --> 01:58:13,630
That's a whole lot of moving right there.

2825
01:58:13,631 --> 01:58:15,101
I was somehow very confident.

2826
01:58:16,471 --> 01:58:17,571
I'll take them.

2827
01:58:18,011 --> 01:58:19,711
(They end with their signature pose.)

2828
01:58:20,681 --> 01:58:22,210
We can pull it off.

2829
01:58:22,211 --> 01:58:23,811
The choreography isn't that hard.

2830
01:58:23,981 --> 01:58:24,981
(Kyra)

2831
01:58:24,982 --> 01:58:26,811
What's wrong with those two little kids?

2832
01:58:27,111 --> 01:58:28,151
Those little kids.

2833
01:58:28,881 --> 01:58:33,691
AG SQUAD's style was quite similar to our style. So...

2834
01:58:34,061 --> 01:58:35,961
it was pretty easy.

2835
01:58:36,761 --> 01:58:37,961
Look at them.

2836
01:58:38,461 --> 01:58:42,801
For sure, they want to bump us off of the main dancer position.

2837
01:58:43,501 --> 01:58:44,501
Try this.

2838
01:58:44,801 --> 01:58:46,400
We're definitely confident...

2839
01:58:46,401 --> 01:58:49,071
because, obviously, it's our choreography that we know about.

2840
01:58:49,601 --> 01:58:50,711
We haven't won yet.

2841
01:58:50,841 --> 01:58:52,111
No, we haven't.

2842
01:58:52,611 --> 01:58:54,741
(AG SQUAD teaches the choreography for the middle class.)

2843
01:58:55,111 --> 01:58:56,980
(Practicing Ruthy Baby's solo part)

2844
01:58:56,981 --> 01:58:59,180
Yes. Somewhere in that moment, people who are up,

2845
01:58:59,181 --> 01:59:01,151
this is your time. This is your time to shine.

2846
01:59:01,621 --> 01:59:04,921
My part appeals to people in the beginning.

2847
01:59:06,591 --> 01:59:08,791
It's Ruthy Baby's part.

2848
01:59:08,961 --> 01:59:09,961
Jolt.

2849
01:59:09,962 --> 01:59:12,561
I think it's important as the very first impression.

2850
01:59:12,931 --> 01:59:15,131
Thus, I don't want to lose.

2851
01:59:15,161 --> 01:59:16,931
Hold. Scoop the air.

2852
01:59:17,231 --> 01:59:20,201
You touch your hair and go, "Boom, boom, boom."

2853
01:59:20,371 --> 01:59:23,001
I decided to do it differently.

2854
01:59:23,541 --> 01:59:25,310
Kaleece, off you go.

2855
01:59:25,311 --> 01:59:26,311
Okay.

2856
01:59:26,571 --> 01:59:27,940
(Leejung)

2857
01:59:27,941 --> 01:59:30,211
The part Leejung had...

2858
01:59:31,081 --> 01:59:32,311
was the kick of the choreography.

2859
01:59:34,451 --> 01:59:37,691
The competition will be the fiercest for the drumming part.

2860
01:59:38,791 --> 01:59:40,291
The stance is very low.

2861
01:59:41,091 --> 01:59:43,590
(The original choreographer, Kaleece, does it smoothly.)

2862
01:59:43,591 --> 01:59:46,131
(Then comes Harmz of ROYAL FAMILY.)

2863
01:59:46,791 --> 01:59:48,530
(They can't help but look to the side.)

2864
01:59:48,531 --> 01:59:50,971
Their physique is different.

2865
01:59:51,771 --> 01:59:53,430
Their power...

2866
01:59:53,431 --> 01:59:57,201
was definitely built over the course of many years.

2867
01:59:57,471 --> 01:59:59,741
It really wasn't easy. The choreography...

2868
02:00:00,441 --> 02:00:02,681
(Speechless)

2869
02:00:03,511 --> 02:00:06,980
(The middle class' practice time turns chaotic.)

2870
02:00:06,981 --> 02:00:09,581
One more. One, two, three.

2871
02:00:09,821 --> 02:00:11,751
(Powerful movements)

2872
02:00:12,591 --> 02:00:13,591
They're really good.

2873
02:00:14,161 --> 02:00:15,191
They became so used to it.

2874
02:00:15,361 --> 02:00:16,461
Who...

2875
02:00:16,621 --> 02:00:17,991
Who are the original choreographers?

2876
02:00:19,161 --> 02:00:21,460
I think ROYAL FAMILY was our rival.

2877
02:00:21,461 --> 02:00:23,301
I've taught them before.

2878
02:00:23,631 --> 02:00:25,571
I was a bit scared...

2879
02:00:25,701 --> 02:00:28,400
that they'd catch on how...

2880
02:00:28,401 --> 02:00:30,071
we actually do the choreography.

2881
02:00:31,411 --> 02:00:33,070
Let's just do it for a couple more times.

2882
02:00:33,071 --> 02:00:34,081
I feel good.

2883
02:00:35,181 --> 02:00:36,741
I think it was easier.

2884
02:00:36,981 --> 02:00:38,580
We're in the good space.

2885
02:00:38,581 --> 02:00:40,081
Yes. We're going to make it.

2886
02:00:40,451 --> 02:00:44,490
This style is very, like we said, similar to ours.

2887
02:00:44,491 --> 02:00:45,820
The girls had better be ready.

2888
02:00:45,821 --> 02:00:47,991
We're coming to take your choreography.

2889
02:00:48,091 --> 02:00:50,590
There's a little bit more pressure because they'll be coming for it.

2890
02:00:50,591 --> 02:00:52,961
We're ready to eat it up.

2891
02:00:53,861 --> 02:00:58,001
The only thought we had was, "We need to work hard."

2892
02:00:58,671 --> 02:00:59,871
There's nothing we can't do.

2893
02:01:00,501 --> 02:01:02,200
We'll practice incredibly hard...

2894
02:01:02,201 --> 02:01:05,141
and become the main dancer no matter what.

2895
02:01:05,771 --> 02:01:07,371
We'll do our absolute best...

2896
02:01:07,781 --> 02:01:08,941
and take the choreography.

2897
02:01:09,781 --> 02:01:11,280
(Which crew will become the middle class' main dancer?)

2898
02:01:11,281 --> 02:01:12,411
Okay. Let's get ready.

2899
02:01:13,611 --> 02:01:16,081
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2900
02:01:16,321 --> 02:01:17,381
Good luck.

2901
02:01:17,991 --> 02:01:19,391
We won't lose. Let's go.

2902
02:01:19,651 --> 02:01:21,591
Show them how it's done. Period.

2903
02:01:21,791 --> 02:01:23,860
Let's go, BUMSUP!

2904
02:01:23,861 --> 02:01:25,760
- Let's go!
- Let's go, y'all!

2905
02:01:25,761 --> 02:01:26,890
(It's such a fun match to watch.)

2906
02:01:26,891 --> 02:01:28,331
It's exciting!

2907
02:01:28,731 --> 02:01:29,800
Fight!

2908
02:01:29,801 --> 02:01:31,070
(ROYAL FAMILY's Kylie, Isla, Zari, and Moana)

2909
02:01:31,071 --> 02:01:32,330
Ten, nine...

2910
02:01:32,331 --> 02:01:34,771
We felt very confident to take AG SQUAD's choreography.

2911
02:01:35,541 --> 02:01:37,071
(Go and take it!)

2912
02:01:37,511 --> 02:01:39,810
I think ROYAL FAMILY is our rival.

2913
02:01:39,811 --> 02:01:42,081
I thought ROYAL FAMILY was the strongest opponent.

2914
02:01:46,581 --> 02:01:47,781
They changed the moves.

2915
02:01:49,051 --> 02:01:52,521
(The original choreography begins with the bandanas pulled down.)

2916
02:01:53,091 --> 02:01:54,490
(ROYAL FAMILY began the choreography by using it as a face mask.)

2917
02:01:54,491 --> 02:01:56,361
It's just to give it something.

2918
02:01:58,791 --> 02:02:00,491
These girls are freaking crazy.

2919
02:02:00,961 --> 02:02:03,601
We can perform the choreography the strongest.

2920
02:02:04,131 --> 02:02:06,130
(Extremely excited)

2921
02:02:06,131 --> 02:02:07,230
(We hope our team wins.)

2922
02:02:07,231 --> 02:02:09,671
They can't beat the originality that we bring.

2923
02:02:10,401 --> 02:02:11,611
They have so much strength.

2924
02:02:12,011 --> 02:02:14,211
- But everyone is so...
- They're so aggressive.

2925
02:02:16,981 --> 02:02:19,881
One hundred percent. We had, like, more fire.

2926
02:02:21,451 --> 02:02:23,220
The stage might break.

2927
02:02:23,221 --> 02:02:25,590
(ROYAL FAMILY's power)

2928
02:02:25,591 --> 02:02:28,090
I just feel like it's more dynamic. But I think...

2929
02:02:28,091 --> 02:02:29,861
- that's just what they're used to.
- Yes.

2930
02:02:34,531 --> 02:02:35,701
(Let's go, friends.)

2931
02:02:37,331 --> 02:02:38,671
I can do it the best.

2932
02:02:38,801 --> 02:02:40,331
- Get low!
- Come on!

2933
02:02:40,501 --> 02:02:41,501
They're so scary.

2934
02:02:44,711 --> 02:02:47,810
I know that's freaking right!

2935
02:02:47,811 --> 02:02:49,040
(They nailed it, right?)

2936
02:02:49,041 --> 02:02:50,110
- Come on.
- That was good,

2937
02:02:50,111 --> 02:02:51,211
but I think we got it.

2938
02:02:51,451 --> 02:02:52,981
- That was scary.
- Nine, eight...

2939
02:02:53,211 --> 02:02:55,750
I'm confident that I can take the main dancer position.

2940
02:02:55,751 --> 02:02:58,691
- Five, four, three, - Let's go, Japan!

2941
02:02:58,991 --> 02:03:01,320
two, one. Go.

2942
02:03:01,321 --> 02:03:03,390
(RHTokyo's Rena, Asuka, Mona and Nina Neves)

2943
02:03:03,391 --> 02:03:04,691
(Impressed)

2944
02:03:06,861 --> 02:03:07,901
They have a good vibe.

2945
02:03:08,661 --> 02:03:10,931
This girl is crazy.

2946
02:03:14,201 --> 02:03:16,001
Okay!

2947
02:03:16,341 --> 02:03:19,441
She is the star of RHTokyo.

2948
02:03:19,611 --> 02:03:20,981
I still felt confident.

2949
02:03:21,041 --> 02:03:23,980
no:ze, show off your charms more.

2950
02:03:23,981 --> 02:03:25,151
Go all out.

2951
02:03:31,091 --> 02:03:32,121
This part is lacking.

2952
02:03:36,191 --> 02:03:37,191
Let's go.

2953
02:03:38,361 --> 02:03:39,690
They matched their facial expressions.

2954
02:03:39,691 --> 02:03:42,201
You guys are so cute!

2955
02:03:42,461 --> 02:03:43,601
Let's go!

2956
02:03:43,861 --> 02:03:45,631
Their groove is a bit lacking in this part.

2957
02:03:46,001 --> 02:03:47,171
I'm confident.

2958
02:03:49,971 --> 02:03:51,440
I like how they did it.

2959
02:03:51,441 --> 02:03:52,970
(Gosh, this is insane.)

2960
02:03:52,971 --> 02:03:55,041
We showed a good performance, in my opinion.

2961
02:03:55,741 --> 02:03:57,110
We're not losing. Let's go.

2962
02:03:57,111 --> 02:03:59,511
- Let's go, girls.
- Get out!

2963
02:03:59,811 --> 02:04:02,521
Given that it was our piece, we were pretty confident.

2964
02:04:02,651 --> 02:04:04,950
- Let's go.
- I feel like... We thought...

2965
02:04:04,951 --> 02:04:07,661
that AG SQUAD was going to be our biggest competitor.

2966
02:04:07,791 --> 02:04:09,421
One. Go.

2967
02:04:11,331 --> 02:04:12,831
Yes. Be nervous.

2968
02:04:14,701 --> 02:04:17,671
We know how to execute our routine very, very well.

2969
02:04:20,731 --> 02:04:22,071
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2970
02:04:25,171 --> 02:04:27,071
We're hungry. We're ready to eat.

2971
02:04:30,511 --> 02:04:31,511
We did it better.

2972
02:04:31,681 --> 02:04:32,980
This is ours.

2973
02:04:32,981 --> 02:04:34,211
And we're here to win it.

2974
02:04:34,821 --> 02:04:36,350
(The squad with the synchronized group dance)

2975
02:04:36,351 --> 02:04:37,351
(AG SQUAD, that's it.)

2976
02:04:37,352 --> 02:04:38,551
(Are you insane?)

2977
02:04:40,961 --> 02:04:41,991
(This is definitely ours.)

2978
02:04:44,261 --> 02:04:46,331
They're good at it. This crew is good at it.

2979
02:04:51,931 --> 02:04:53,000
(Everyone is so good at it.)

2980
02:04:53,001 --> 02:04:54,301
Yes, ladies.

2981
02:04:54,401 --> 02:04:55,840
We gave it our all.

2982
02:04:55,841 --> 02:04:57,711
We were confident that we were going to win it.

2983
02:04:58,271 --> 02:05:00,240
- OSAKA Ojo Gang, let's go!
- Eight,

2984
02:05:00,241 --> 02:05:01,840
- seven, six...
- Let's go!

2985
02:05:01,841 --> 02:05:03,040
- Let's go!
- Minami is really good.

2986
02:05:03,041 --> 02:05:05,210
I'm confident that we'll take the main dancer position.

2987
02:05:05,211 --> 02:05:07,850
Backup dancer? I don't like that title.

2988
02:05:07,851 --> 02:05:09,051
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's Kyoka, Minami, Hana, and Ruu)

2989
02:05:17,191 --> 02:05:18,261
They'll win.

2990
02:05:25,071 --> 02:05:26,071
(That's it!)

2991
02:05:30,501 --> 02:05:31,741
That was weak.

2992
02:05:32,041 --> 02:05:33,870
There was no teamwork between the four members.

2993
02:05:33,871 --> 02:05:37,181
I felt like each member wanted to catch attention.

2994
02:05:37,981 --> 02:05:38,981
We have a chance.

2995
02:05:42,621 --> 02:05:43,621
(Minami, let's go!)

2996
02:05:46,421 --> 02:05:47,551
Minami is so good.

2997
02:05:51,391 --> 02:05:52,661
(They're good.)

2998
02:05:52,861 --> 02:05:54,260
That suited OSAKA Ojo Gang.

2999
02:05:54,261 --> 02:05:55,830
- We showed a good performance.
- Eight,

3000
02:05:55,831 --> 02:05:56,931
- seven, - Let's go!

3001
02:05:56,961 --> 02:05:59,401
- six, five, four, - Let's go!

3002
02:05:59,571 --> 02:06:00,900
- The older girls have our backs.
- three.

3003
02:06:00,901 --> 02:06:03,700
- We'll become the main dancer.
- two, one. Go.

3004
02:06:03,701 --> 02:06:05,011
(BUMSUP's Aiki, Hyojin Choi, no:ze, and Leejung)

3005
02:06:05,271 --> 02:06:06,271
Here we go!

3006
02:06:10,511 --> 02:06:11,511
Oh, cute.

3007
02:06:21,591 --> 02:06:22,591
There you go.

3008
02:06:22,592 --> 02:06:23,960
(BUMSUP reinterpreted it in their own style.)

3009
02:06:23,961 --> 02:06:25,131
I see a lot of changes.

3010
02:06:25,691 --> 02:06:28,000
We don't need to copy the choreography exactly.

3011
02:06:28,001 --> 02:06:30,460
- Let's show our unique charms.
- Here we go!

3012
02:06:30,461 --> 02:06:31,901
- That's so smart.
- Let's go!

3013
02:06:33,631 --> 02:06:34,641
Let's go!

3014
02:06:37,401 --> 02:06:38,671
(Bouncing)

3015
02:06:43,181 --> 02:06:45,510
- She's so good.
- She changed the choreography.

3016
02:06:45,511 --> 02:06:47,550
- They did well.
- They did well.

3017
02:06:47,551 --> 02:06:49,980
- We couldn't do better than that.
- Seven, six,

3018
02:06:49,981 --> 02:06:52,221
- We got this. Us, together.
- five, four,

3019
02:06:52,551 --> 02:06:54,220
- three, two...
- Here we go.

3020
02:06:54,221 --> 02:06:56,391
- Let's go.
- Go!

3021
02:06:56,961 --> 02:06:58,561
(MOTIV's Fantaye, Logistx, Bella, and Nyssa)

3022
02:06:59,691 --> 02:07:01,630
I wanted to show that we can be also, like,

3023
02:07:01,631 --> 02:07:03,061
strong, tight, and clean.

3024
02:07:03,661 --> 02:07:04,671
(This is it.)

3025
02:07:05,731 --> 02:07:07,471
She's good. The gesture is really nice.

3026
02:07:07,531 --> 02:07:08,871
Let's go!

3027
02:07:15,511 --> 02:07:16,941
(Focused)

3028
02:07:18,151 --> 02:07:20,380
- Let's go!
- We weren't feeling...

3029
02:07:20,381 --> 02:07:21,481
- too intimidated.
- Yes!

3030
02:07:23,521 --> 02:07:24,591
Come on, Logistx!

3031
02:07:28,991 --> 02:07:29,991
Yes!

3032
02:07:29,991 --> 02:07:30,991
(In sync)

3033
02:07:32,091 --> 02:07:33,091
Go!

3034
02:07:35,261 --> 02:07:37,330
(Our members are the best.)

3035
02:07:37,331 --> 02:07:38,971
That was good.

3036
02:07:39,231 --> 02:07:42,170
- Great job, y'all. That was good.
- Okay.

3037
02:07:42,171 --> 02:07:43,640
It was hard.

3038
02:07:43,641 --> 02:07:44,710
But we ate that.

3039
02:07:44,711 --> 02:07:46,410
I don't know what the result will be.

3040
02:07:46,411 --> 02:07:48,381
It'll be impossible to choose the winner.

3041
02:07:49,281 --> 02:07:50,740
How are we going to make this decision?

3042
02:07:50,741 --> 02:07:52,911
We had such a hard time last time. How are we going to...

3043
02:07:53,451 --> 02:07:54,981
Each crew had different colors.

3044
02:07:55,181 --> 02:07:56,980
First question from me is for AG SQUAD.

3045
02:07:56,981 --> 02:07:58,121
You guys did the choreography.

3046
02:07:58,351 --> 02:08:00,621
Outside of you, who scared you the most?

3047
02:08:01,091 --> 02:08:04,291
It's a competition, but we're just focusing on us right now.

3048
02:08:04,361 --> 02:08:05,930
Nothing is bothering me right now.

3049
02:08:05,931 --> 02:08:07,191
I think we freaking killed it.

3050
02:08:07,691 --> 02:08:08,831
Sorry.

3051
02:08:09,331 --> 02:08:10,600
Period!

3052
02:08:10,601 --> 02:08:13,000
I've got to give it up to AG SQUAD...

3053
02:08:13,001 --> 02:08:15,470
for constructing a routine like this.

3054
02:08:15,471 --> 02:08:19,141
There were so many highlights for personalities.

3055
02:08:19,311 --> 02:08:22,410
And I feel like it made everyone make different choices.

3056
02:08:22,411 --> 02:08:25,911
(Crews showcased choreography matching each personality.)

3057
02:08:25,981 --> 02:08:27,750
I also have to say about Korea.

3058
02:08:27,751 --> 02:08:30,980
Leejung. You were finding moments, and you were drawing it out.

3059
02:08:30,981 --> 02:08:32,450
I just want to give you props.

3060
02:08:32,451 --> 02:08:34,320
It was just a mastery of movements.

3061
02:08:34,321 --> 02:08:37,760
Team Korea, I could see every one of you,

3062
02:08:37,761 --> 02:08:38,990
your style and expression.

3063
02:08:38,991 --> 02:08:42,400
That is a good thing, but it also worries me.

3064
02:08:42,401 --> 02:08:45,901
When it comes to unity, it might be a loss.

3065
02:08:46,101 --> 02:08:48,400
Rena. It's good to see you on the stage again.

3066
02:08:48,401 --> 02:08:50,701
The former champion of these challenges.

3067
02:08:50,801 --> 02:08:52,970
RHTokyo. You guys are so smart.

3068
02:08:52,971 --> 02:08:54,411
Playing into your strength.

3069
02:08:54,611 --> 02:08:57,281
(Reinterpreting the choreography in a cute, kitschy manner)

3070
02:08:57,381 --> 02:08:58,880
You scream every time she comes out.

3071
02:08:58,881 --> 02:08:59,881
I know.

3072
02:08:59,882 --> 02:09:01,280
The main character's energy.

3073
02:09:01,281 --> 02:09:03,250
You're just undeniable.

3074
02:09:03,251 --> 02:09:06,621
My eyes go straight to you every time.

3075
02:09:06,791 --> 02:09:07,991
Amazing work.

3076
02:09:08,761 --> 02:09:11,530
Team New Zealand. When you first came out,

3077
02:09:11,531 --> 02:09:13,990
all of us went, "Oh, my gosh."

3078
02:09:13,991 --> 02:09:15,401
Hype. Crazy.

3079
02:09:15,601 --> 02:09:17,830
I really felt like you guys were telling us,

3080
02:09:17,831 --> 02:09:19,530
"Shut up. This is the vibe."

3081
02:09:19,531 --> 02:09:21,241
So major props.

3082
02:09:21,641 --> 02:09:23,601
Respectfully.

3083
02:09:23,971 --> 02:09:25,971
We're going to have to make a really difficult decision.

3084
02:09:26,041 --> 02:09:27,941
Major respect to everybody.

3085
02:09:28,311 --> 02:09:29,810
(The fight judges are discussing.)

3086
02:09:29,811 --> 02:09:31,780
- You did a great job.
- It was awesome.

3087
02:09:31,781 --> 02:09:34,451
Be confident. You did an amazing job. I mean it.

3088
02:09:34,551 --> 02:09:36,221
That was intense.

3089
02:09:36,451 --> 02:09:38,051
You guys definitely did your thing.

3090
02:09:38,221 --> 02:09:39,251
I want to be the main dancer.

3091
02:09:39,621 --> 02:09:42,690
Who you got? Regarding the tightness, they were the worst.

3092
02:09:42,691 --> 02:09:46,090
Regarding the personal spice, they were pretty nice.

3093
02:09:46,091 --> 02:09:48,160
I felt like OSAKA Ojo Gang's lines were...

3094
02:09:48,161 --> 02:09:49,700
- really fabulous.
- Lifting a leg was fine.

3095
02:09:49,701 --> 02:09:51,601
- But after that, not so much.
- Yes.

3096
02:09:51,731 --> 02:09:53,701
Did you guys like RHTokyo?

3097
02:09:53,801 --> 02:09:55,971
If they want a cute dance video,

3098
02:09:56,071 --> 02:09:57,641
they can't choose any other crew as the main dancers.

3099
02:09:58,111 --> 02:09:59,611
They deserve to be the one.

3100
02:10:00,271 --> 02:10:01,940
They were pretty similar.

3101
02:10:01,941 --> 02:10:04,410
The strength was the same, but I just feel like...

3102
02:10:04,411 --> 02:10:06,251
- ROYAL FAMILY was better.
- I agree.

3103
02:10:06,651 --> 02:10:09,151
They understood this choreography and just killed it.

3104
02:10:09,481 --> 02:10:10,681
You ate that.

3105
02:10:10,781 --> 02:10:12,090
- You ate it a lot.
- You ate that.

3106
02:10:12,091 --> 02:10:13,750
In my eyes, we're winners.

3107
02:10:13,751 --> 02:10:15,491
We never forgot the choreography.

3108
02:10:15,591 --> 02:10:17,660
But I'm thinking about who is going to direct it.

3109
02:10:17,661 --> 02:10:18,890
At the end of the day,

3110
02:10:18,891 --> 02:10:22,661
it needs to be also someone that can direct the music video.

3111
02:10:22,761 --> 02:10:25,400
No offense to the ROYAL FAMILY, but I don't know.

3112
02:10:25,401 --> 02:10:27,231
They're going to reuse choreography.

3113
02:10:27,431 --> 02:10:30,070
You can even say all the clips that did go off were...

3114
02:10:30,071 --> 02:10:31,971
ours, not theirs.

3115
02:10:32,341 --> 02:10:33,970
We use original moves.

3116
02:10:33,971 --> 02:10:35,110
We don't recycle.

3117
02:10:35,111 --> 02:10:36,480
It depends on what the priority is.

3118
02:10:36,481 --> 02:10:39,951
Is it more important to pick the star? Or pick the director?

3119
02:10:40,211 --> 02:10:42,351
(Who is the fight judges' choice for the main dancers?)

3120
02:10:42,581 --> 02:10:45,491
We decided to choose a few teams to see once again.

3121
02:10:45,591 --> 02:10:46,591
RHTokyo.

3122
02:10:47,391 --> 02:10:48,421
AG SQUAD.

3123
02:10:48,821 --> 02:10:49,821
ROYAL FAMILY.

3124
02:10:50,461 --> 02:10:52,290
Let's get it together once again.

3125
02:10:52,291 --> 02:10:53,891
You'll be great because you're awesome.

3126
02:10:54,331 --> 02:10:56,800
Rocking again. Same again. Performance.

3127
02:10:56,801 --> 02:10:59,070
- Performance. Faces.
- Same again.

3128
02:10:59,071 --> 02:11:01,231
You have to give the main character.

3129
02:11:01,341 --> 02:11:02,901
You do have to be different.

3130
02:11:03,071 --> 02:11:05,241
- Are you going to take it off?
- Yes.

3131
02:11:05,611 --> 02:11:06,971
So, I'll catch your jacket.

3132
02:11:07,211 --> 02:11:08,911
- Go, ladies.
- Let's go.

3133
02:11:09,181 --> 02:11:10,181
Come on, guys!

3134
02:11:10,182 --> 02:11:11,410
RHTokyo!

3135
02:11:11,411 --> 02:11:13,051
- Let's go.
- Let's do it again

3136
02:11:14,381 --> 02:11:15,721
I'll have fun.

3137
02:11:16,051 --> 02:11:18,950
I thought we would lose when it came to power moves,

3138
02:11:18,951 --> 02:11:21,761
but we could win with something else.

3139
02:11:22,161 --> 02:11:23,321
Do as you always do.

3140
02:11:23,521 --> 02:11:24,791
I'll give it all, so watch me.

3141
02:11:25,461 --> 02:11:26,461
Okay!

3142
02:11:29,301 --> 02:11:30,301
Nina!

3143
02:11:31,301 --> 02:11:32,971
- Let's go, Nina!
- Go!

3144
02:11:33,501 --> 02:11:34,631
Nina!

3145
02:11:35,641 --> 02:11:36,641
(Nina is the best.)

3146
02:11:36,671 --> 02:11:38,641
I was like just on fire.

3147
02:11:38,741 --> 02:11:39,971
She's something.

3148
02:11:46,381 --> 02:11:47,881
(Tokyo Power!)

3149
02:11:48,621 --> 02:11:49,881
Great! Have fun!

3150
02:11:55,561 --> 02:11:56,760
Rena!

3151
02:11:56,761 --> 02:11:57,790
Let's go!

3152
02:11:57,791 --> 02:11:59,161
Mona! Let's go!

3153
02:11:59,991 --> 02:12:00,991
Let's go!

3154
02:12:04,871 --> 02:12:06,700
(Amazing)

3155
02:12:06,701 --> 02:12:08,301
That was crazy.

3156
02:12:08,971 --> 02:12:11,910
Now, you ate it all and are full!

3157
02:12:11,911 --> 02:12:14,371
I felt like we already won.

3158
02:12:15,641 --> 02:12:16,911
- Performance.
- Nine,

3159
02:12:17,381 --> 02:12:19,480
- eight, seven, - Let's go!

3160
02:12:19,481 --> 02:12:21,110
- six, five, - Show them how to do it.

3161
02:12:21,111 --> 02:12:22,451
- Clean. Sharp.
- four...

3162
02:12:22,981 --> 02:12:26,091
It'll be disappointing if we lose it.

3163
02:12:33,361 --> 02:12:34,661
(Goosebumps)

3164
02:12:34,731 --> 02:12:36,561
We'll not give it to anyone.

3165
02:12:38,531 --> 02:12:39,571
Go!

3166
02:12:41,271 --> 02:12:42,401
Go!

3167
02:12:43,341 --> 02:12:45,271
I'm ready to show what I've got.

3168
02:12:45,971 --> 02:12:46,971
Let's go!

3169
02:12:46,971 --> 02:12:47,971
(Power up)

3170
02:12:47,972 --> 02:12:49,111
They might break the stage.

3171
02:12:50,811 --> 02:12:53,251
We really want to prove ourselves to everyone.

3172
02:12:53,551 --> 02:12:54,581
Let's go!

3173
02:12:55,681 --> 02:12:56,721
(This is it!)

3174
02:13:00,521 --> 02:13:01,521
They're standing out.

3175
02:13:01,522 --> 02:13:03,091
AG SQUAD really nails this part.

3176
02:13:07,991 --> 02:13:09,900
(Undeniable)

3177
02:13:09,901 --> 02:13:11,361
Hey, awesome!

3178
02:13:11,801 --> 02:13:13,371
I'm so proud.

3179
02:13:14,001 --> 02:13:15,071
Let's go.

3180
02:13:16,001 --> 02:13:18,310
- Let's go!
- Go!

3181
02:13:18,311 --> 02:13:19,440
Come on! Let's go!

3182
02:13:19,441 --> 02:13:21,610
They're going to smash on the stage.

3183
02:13:21,611 --> 02:13:22,611
Get up, girls.

3184
02:13:22,612 --> 02:13:24,981
We want to prove that we can be the main dancers.

3185
02:13:35,191 --> 02:13:36,991
(Sexy Isla)

3186
02:13:37,521 --> 02:13:39,531
We focus on details.

3187
02:13:40,091 --> 02:13:43,301
We have the capability to beat AG SQUAD.

3188
02:13:45,071 --> 02:13:46,101
Okay!

3189
02:13:46,531 --> 02:13:48,641
I'm going to do anything to my best way.

3190
02:13:51,241 --> 02:13:52,771
Aren't you crazy?

3191
02:13:56,381 --> 02:13:58,211
They might break the stage.

3192
02:14:08,491 --> 02:14:10,691
We're here to win the mission.

3193
02:14:15,531 --> 02:14:17,601
- Oh, my gosh.
- That's the vibe.

3194
02:14:18,001 --> 02:14:20,431
You ate it all. You ate it.

3195
02:14:20,601 --> 02:14:22,271
It was really powerful.

3196
02:14:22,771 --> 02:14:25,170
(Still in shock)

3197
02:14:25,171 --> 02:14:27,471
You nailed it.

3198
02:14:28,341 --> 02:14:29,911
We'll announce the result.

3199
02:14:31,111 --> 02:14:32,581
It was between two teams.

3200
02:14:32,911 --> 02:14:35,051
Honestly, everyone did really well.

3201
02:14:36,251 --> 02:14:37,951
RHTokyo.

3202
02:14:38,591 --> 02:14:39,791
You did a great job.

3203
02:14:40,351 --> 02:14:41,791
(Nervous)

3204
02:14:41,891 --> 02:14:43,321
You should be a little careful...

3205
02:14:44,491 --> 02:14:48,501
with taking choreography, not changing it too much.

3206
02:14:49,461 --> 02:14:53,001
(RHTokyo altered the choreography with their own interpretation.)

3207
02:14:53,701 --> 02:14:55,371
Doing what was given.

3208
02:14:55,501 --> 02:14:58,201
Honor the choreography and what it is.

3209
02:14:58,441 --> 02:14:59,710
It's a totally different style.

3210
02:14:59,711 --> 02:15:00,740
Not in their reign.

3211
02:15:00,741 --> 02:15:02,110
It was definitely their reign.

3212
02:15:02,111 --> 02:15:03,380
Absolutely.

3213
02:15:03,381 --> 02:15:06,181
People are going to battle it. Let them shine with their strength.

3214
02:15:06,381 --> 02:15:07,781
(Agreed)

3215
02:15:07,881 --> 02:15:10,781
Which was to be expected. ROYAL FAMILY.

3216
02:15:11,221 --> 02:15:14,091
I feel like no one executed as well as these two.

3217
02:15:14,691 --> 02:15:16,891
I think Team Australia...

3218
02:15:16,991 --> 02:15:19,761
had better moments than RHTokyo.

3219
02:15:19,861 --> 02:15:20,861
Of course.

3220
02:15:21,091 --> 02:15:23,800
When it comes to what is being attacked,

3221
02:15:23,801 --> 02:15:25,801
and then what is soft.

3222
02:15:26,371 --> 02:15:28,741
(Delicate and soft intro)

3223
02:15:29,001 --> 02:15:30,601
(Proud)

3224
02:15:31,301 --> 02:15:32,771
(Highlights with powerful movements)

3225
02:15:32,871 --> 02:15:34,211
(Falling into them)

3226
02:15:34,341 --> 02:15:35,341
Crazy.

3227
02:15:35,981 --> 02:15:37,140
(Thank you.)

3228
02:15:37,141 --> 02:15:40,550
I'm going to give props to Team New Zealand, ROYAL FAMILY.

3229
02:15:40,551 --> 02:15:42,451
The skill level is so high.

3230
02:15:43,781 --> 02:15:46,191
(ROYAL FAMILY playing with the beat with accurate movements)

3231
02:15:46,451 --> 02:15:47,820
(This is it!)

3232
02:15:47,821 --> 02:15:49,091
Now, I understand...

3233
02:15:49,961 --> 02:15:52,560
why ROYAL FAMILY selected this choreography.

3234
02:15:52,561 --> 02:15:53,661
Because...

3235
02:15:54,531 --> 02:15:56,730
you exactly understand...

3236
02:15:56,731 --> 02:15:58,801
how this dance should look like...

3237
02:15:59,171 --> 02:16:01,001
and how it should feel like.

3238
02:16:02,201 --> 02:16:05,010
They did so well, and now I'm so proud of them.

3239
02:16:05,011 --> 02:16:07,771
I'll announce the main dancers we chose.

3240
02:16:07,871 --> 02:16:11,711
My girls absolutely slayed the house down.

3241
02:16:11,881 --> 02:16:15,220
I feel like our AG SQUAD's girls' choreography is stronger...

3242
02:16:15,221 --> 02:16:16,681
than the ROYAL FAMILY's choreography.

3243
02:16:17,121 --> 02:16:20,421
The main dancers for the middle class are...

3244
02:16:20,921 --> 02:16:22,761
ROYAL FAMILY.

3245
02:16:23,391 --> 02:16:24,391
(The main dancers for the middle class)

3246
02:16:24,392 --> 02:16:26,091
(ROYAL FAMILY)

3247
02:16:26,191 --> 02:16:27,931
(Screaming)

3248
02:16:28,331 --> 02:16:29,861
(So happy)

3249
02:16:30,561 --> 02:16:33,370
(Giving them applause)

3250
02:16:33,371 --> 02:16:37,301
Everybody in here. The skill level is so high.

3251
02:16:37,401 --> 02:16:41,311
So, I feel like, in terms of showing that fire...

3252
02:16:41,341 --> 02:16:43,681
My gosh! Like when you took the jacket off.

3253
02:16:45,211 --> 02:16:47,550
I feel like that's one of those choices...

3254
02:16:47,551 --> 02:16:49,181
that it's a hit or a miss.

3255
02:16:49,281 --> 02:16:51,580
But in that moment, for whatever reason,

3256
02:16:51,581 --> 02:16:53,491
it was so raw.

3257
02:16:53,591 --> 02:16:54,850
(It's me.)

3258
02:16:54,851 --> 02:16:57,620
And I feel like it's undeniable that...

3259
02:16:57,621 --> 02:17:00,361
all of us felt the fire that you bring.

3260
02:17:00,691 --> 02:17:02,160
Just like I'm going to do anything...

3261
02:17:02,161 --> 02:17:04,230
to make us win, to make us stand out.

3262
02:17:04,231 --> 02:17:06,070
About taking off my jacket,

3263
02:17:06,071 --> 02:17:08,301
I think it was a really smart choice.

3264
02:17:08,671 --> 02:17:10,270
You all did a great job.

3265
02:17:10,271 --> 02:17:12,311
You guys should be so proud of yourselves.

3266
02:17:13,341 --> 02:17:14,670
(No...)

3267
02:17:14,671 --> 02:17:17,411
Which I did get angry about...

3268
02:17:17,781 --> 02:17:18,781
was ROYAL FAMILY.

3269
02:17:18,881 --> 02:17:21,281
It's not over. We can still win.

3270
02:17:21,381 --> 02:17:23,051
That's the last time we're losing.

3271
02:17:24,351 --> 02:17:27,121
Now, finally, we will begin...

3272
02:17:27,321 --> 02:17:28,921
the Main Dancer Audition of the leader class,

3273
02:17:29,291 --> 02:17:33,260
which will determine the pride of the crew and the country.

3274
02:17:33,261 --> 02:17:34,661
Okay!

3275
02:17:34,891 --> 02:17:36,300
Let's go, Marlee!

3276
02:17:36,301 --> 02:17:37,760
Go, Teesha!

3277
02:17:37,761 --> 02:17:40,231
Let's go! Yes, baby!

3278
02:17:40,331 --> 02:17:41,901
Kaea, let's go!

3279
02:17:42,001 --> 02:17:43,300
Go, Kaea!

3280
02:17:43,301 --> 02:17:44,740
Go!

3281
02:17:44,741 --> 02:17:45,771
Let's go!

3282
02:17:45,871 --> 02:17:48,271
- In 3, 2, 1. RHTokyo!
- RHTokyo!

3283
02:17:49,141 --> 02:17:50,710
Honey J!

3284
02:17:50,711 --> 02:17:52,111
Honey J!

3285
02:17:52,211 --> 02:17:55,081
You're so beautiful! Oh, my gosh!

3286
02:17:55,181 --> 02:17:56,750
This is about to be so sick.

3287
02:17:56,751 --> 02:17:57,950
It's going to be brutal.

3288
02:17:57,951 --> 02:17:59,091
This is the leader class.

3289
02:18:00,051 --> 02:18:03,620
Honey J, you made it to the final but weren't selected.

3290
02:18:03,621 --> 02:18:05,791
You have to compete for victory now.

3291
02:18:06,091 --> 02:18:08,291
I'll do my best to steal the choreography.

3292
02:18:09,801 --> 02:18:10,801
Rie Hata.

3293
02:18:11,161 --> 02:18:14,371
Are you confident you'll be selected as the main dancer?

3294
02:18:15,141 --> 02:18:18,611
When I create a choreography for K-pop,

3295
02:18:18,941 --> 02:18:21,040
I gave it to someone else.

3296
02:18:21,041 --> 02:18:22,440
But this time,

3297
02:18:22,441 --> 02:18:24,080
I made the choreography...

3298
02:18:24,081 --> 02:18:27,850
for the dance video for dancers like us.

3299
02:18:27,851 --> 02:18:29,281
I want to be the main dancer.

3300
02:18:31,991 --> 02:18:33,991
- She's cool.
- She's cool indeed.

3301
02:18:34,251 --> 02:18:36,260
The Main Dancer Audition for the leader class...

3302
02:18:36,261 --> 02:18:37,791
starts now.

3303
02:18:38,161 --> 02:18:39,491
Are you ready? Fight!

3304
02:18:39,731 --> 02:18:41,161
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

3305
02:18:42,261 --> 02:18:44,260
I have confidence in becoming the main dancer.

3306
02:18:44,261 --> 02:18:45,670
- Six, five, - Let's go, Marlee!

3307
02:18:45,671 --> 02:18:46,970
- I felt confident.
- four...

3308
02:18:46,971 --> 02:18:49,071
- Don't feel pressured. Just play.
- Five, four,

3309
02:18:49,501 --> 02:18:50,640
- three, - I was so desperate.

3310
02:18:50,641 --> 02:18:52,510
- two, one.
- I decided to show my real self.

3311
02:18:52,511 --> 02:18:53,940
- Have fun.
- Hey.

3312
02:18:53,941 --> 02:18:54,941
(Let's focus, Janell.)

3313
02:19:00,751 --> 02:19:02,080
(The Main Dancer Audition for the leader class begins.)

3314
02:19:02,081 --> 02:19:03,320
Let's go!

3315
02:19:03,321 --> 02:19:04,580
I'm the one...

3316
02:19:04,581 --> 02:19:08,090
who can do my choreography in the most charming way.

3317
02:19:08,091 --> 02:19:10,160
I'll be the main dancer no matter what.

3318
02:19:10,161 --> 02:19:12,061
I'm always the main dancer.

3319
02:19:12,531 --> 02:19:14,460
She made it hers.

3320
02:19:14,461 --> 02:19:16,261
Until the very end, I won't give up on the main dancer position.

3321
02:19:16,531 --> 02:19:18,201
I'm hungrier than you.

3322
02:19:18,701 --> 02:19:20,031
She's trying to battle with me.

3323
02:19:20,701 --> 02:19:22,470
That's real!

3324
02:19:22,471 --> 02:19:24,770
Not scared! Unafraid!

3325
02:19:24,771 --> 02:19:26,011
Great job, everyone.

3326
02:19:26,271 --> 02:19:30,110
That is just the highest level.

3327
02:19:30,111 --> 02:19:33,280
Honey J, I feel like you just have the Korean swagger.

3328
02:19:33,281 --> 02:19:34,910
She won. Honey J has to win.

3329
02:19:34,911 --> 02:19:37,720
Rie, I feel like it's all the things.

3330
02:19:37,721 --> 02:19:39,421
I thought that I'd win.

3331
02:19:40,821 --> 02:19:43,290
(After the Main Dancer Audition for the leader class)

3332
02:19:43,291 --> 02:19:45,531
(Patting)

3333
02:19:45,831 --> 02:19:47,361
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

3334
02:19:48,701 --> 02:19:51,761
Everyone must've hoped that I'd win.

3335
02:19:53,331 --> 02:19:55,070
Emotions washed over me...

3336
02:19:55,071 --> 02:19:56,570
and made me tearful.

3337
02:19:56,571 --> 02:19:58,871
(Who will be the main dancer in the leader class?)

3338
02:20:00,511 --> 02:20:02,280
Everyone, be sure to remember that information.

3339
02:20:02,281 --> 02:20:04,281
Warning. Don't be the worst dancer.

3340
02:20:05,951 --> 02:20:07,010
(The main director will choreograph for the director's cut section.)

3341
02:20:07,011 --> 02:20:08,080
(One chosen crew can be the lead of the director's cut.)

3342
02:20:08,081 --> 02:20:09,620
That means there's a section...

3343
02:20:09,621 --> 02:20:11,950
where 4 of us or 2 of us can be the lead.

3344
02:20:11,951 --> 02:20:12,990
If we become the lead,

3345
02:20:12,991 --> 02:20:14,990
our chance of becoming the worst dancer will fall.

3346
02:20:14,991 --> 02:20:16,660
As for the director's cut section,

3347
02:20:16,661 --> 02:20:18,890
the main dancer will make decisions.

3348
02:20:18,891 --> 02:20:20,660
Let's listen to what they want...

3349
02:20:20,661 --> 02:20:23,430
and what they want to show.

3350
02:20:23,431 --> 02:20:25,000
- Let's get on their good side.
- Let's get on their good side.

3351
02:20:25,001 --> 02:20:26,071
Look at that.

3352
02:20:26,371 --> 02:20:28,270
I can't do this. I don't like them.

3353
02:20:28,271 --> 02:20:30,170
Our team won the main dancer position...

3354
02:20:30,171 --> 02:20:31,501
- for the middle class.
- I got you, girl.

3355
02:20:32,341 --> 02:20:35,680
We're the main dancers slash directors now.

3356
02:20:35,681 --> 02:20:37,110
They're the backup dancers.

3357
02:20:37,111 --> 02:20:38,440
Yes. They're the trees.

3358
02:20:38,441 --> 02:20:40,350
How will they use 24 people?

3359
02:20:40,351 --> 02:20:41,351
That's a lot of people.

3360
02:20:41,352 --> 02:20:42,620
Maybe they won't use every team.

3361
02:20:42,621 --> 02:20:44,551
They have the first say, and I don't like it.

3362
02:20:44,581 --> 02:20:45,821
Who do we want with us?

3363
02:20:46,751 --> 02:20:47,950
Do you think we should change it?

3364
02:20:47,951 --> 02:20:49,691
Oh, yes. Like, if someone's...

3365
02:20:50,221 --> 02:20:51,821
I don't think they'll accept it.

3366
02:20:52,331 --> 02:20:56,901
Next line. Hyojin Choi, no:ze, Asuka, and Hana.

3367
02:20:57,001 --> 02:20:59,471
We need to do well in the back no matter what.

3368
02:20:59,871 --> 02:21:02,040
Even though it got robbed from us...

3369
02:21:02,041 --> 02:21:05,071
We're trying to make it look good for the director's cut.

3370
02:21:05,841 --> 02:21:07,010
We're on horses.

3371
02:21:07,011 --> 02:21:09,510
I could feel how relaxed the main dancers were.

3372
02:21:09,511 --> 02:21:10,811
Isn't this too much?

3373
02:21:10,881 --> 02:21:12,481
If we don't like it, we need to be the main dancers.

3374
02:21:13,251 --> 02:21:15,481
They really take us as the backup dancers.

3375
02:21:15,981 --> 02:21:17,621
That's my biggest pet peeve.

3376
02:21:17,851 --> 02:21:18,851
Watch out, y'all,

3377
02:21:18,852 --> 02:21:21,151
because the worst dancer choice is in our hands.

3378
02:21:21,691 --> 02:21:23,760
So how would you pick your worst dancer...

3379
02:21:23,761 --> 02:21:26,160
with the freedom of power in your hands?

3380
02:21:26,161 --> 02:21:29,060
Honestly, I think, for us, it's attitude.

3381
02:21:29,061 --> 02:21:30,500
(Looking around)

3382
02:21:30,501 --> 02:21:32,230
ROYAL FAMILY isn't here yet.

3383
02:21:32,231 --> 02:21:33,301
Vanessa.

3384
02:21:33,601 --> 02:21:34,830
I'm going to hit the toilet real quick.

3385
02:21:34,831 --> 02:21:36,870
Uhm... What was she doing?

3386
02:21:36,871 --> 02:21:37,871
- I think she was...
- Maiya,

3387
02:21:37,871 --> 02:21:38,871
do you want to come with me?

3388
02:21:38,872 --> 02:21:40,011
(Glancing over)

3389
02:21:40,641 --> 02:21:42,081
They're doing TikTok.

3390
02:21:42,541 --> 02:21:43,611
That's so funny.

3391
02:21:44,081 --> 02:21:45,950
They ate that one, but it's so funny.

3392
02:21:45,951 --> 02:21:47,011
ROYAL FAMILY.

3393
02:21:47,251 --> 02:21:48,311
I don't like that.

3394
02:21:48,481 --> 02:21:49,680
- They're doing TikTok.
- Yes.

3395
02:21:49,681 --> 02:21:51,651
I see the camera!

3396
02:21:51,991 --> 02:21:54,791
They're cracking jokes all the time.

3397
02:21:54,921 --> 02:21:57,020
They chat a lot.

3398
02:21:57,021 --> 02:21:58,861
I just feel like they aren't giving it their best.

3399
02:21:59,831 --> 02:22:03,231
She fell once. It was Kylie.

3400
02:22:03,461 --> 02:22:06,330
You girls know what to do. Just give it your all, okay?

3401
02:22:06,331 --> 02:22:08,101
Let's just go once again.

3402
02:22:08,601 --> 02:22:09,900
Worst dancer nominee.

3403
02:22:09,901 --> 02:22:13,310
Wait, what if they chose us? Vanessa and Aaliyah.

3404
02:22:13,311 --> 02:22:14,370
Surely not.

3405
02:22:14,371 --> 02:22:15,581
(No way)

3406
02:22:15,841 --> 02:22:18,280
"Street Woman Fighter 1," "Street Woman Fighter 2,"

3407
02:22:18,281 --> 02:22:19,281
"Street Man Fighter..."

3408
02:22:19,282 --> 02:22:21,551
There hasn't been a performance of this level.

3409
02:22:21,911 --> 02:22:23,420
(Judging the dance videos for the Class Mission)

3410
02:22:23,421 --> 02:22:24,421
(Make some noise!)

3411
02:22:25,221 --> 02:22:26,551
I got chills right now!

3412
02:22:26,991 --> 02:22:28,150
(They give up on judging.)

3413
02:22:28,151 --> 02:22:29,220
(The dance videos for the Class Mission...)

3414
02:22:29,221 --> 02:22:30,291
(that put the judges in awe will be revealed.)

3415
02:22:30,821 --> 02:22:33,790
The main dancers have the powerful authority...

3416
02:22:33,791 --> 02:22:35,231
to pick the worst dancer.

3417
02:22:35,561 --> 02:22:38,600
For the rookie class, middle class, and leader class,

3418
02:22:38,601 --> 02:22:40,770
please pick the worst dancer.

3419
02:22:40,771 --> 02:22:42,271
It isn't us. Don't worry.

3420
02:22:42,871 --> 02:22:43,871
Of course not.

3421
02:22:44,101 --> 02:22:47,470
The crew that we've chosen made it kind of easy for us today.

3422
02:22:47,471 --> 02:22:49,941
The worst dancer is...

3423
02:22:52,211 --> 02:22:54,080
- You guys are amazing.
- Thank you.

3424
02:22:54,081 --> 02:22:55,921
You're not the worst dancer.

3425
02:22:56,321 --> 02:22:57,751
Thank you. Shut up.

3426
02:22:59,091 --> 02:23:00,351
Give me a break!

3427
02:23:02,821 --> 02:23:05,160
The nice Ibuki is gone.

3428
02:23:05,161 --> 02:23:06,361
It can never be us.

3429
02:23:06,591 --> 02:23:07,591
Never.

3430
02:23:08,131 --> 02:23:09,961
Never. It can never be us.

3431
02:23:10,301 --> 02:23:11,430
I'm not even angry anymore.

3432
02:23:11,431 --> 02:23:12,600
Shall we wreak some havoc?

3433
02:23:12,601 --> 02:23:14,731
Yes. We'll need to kill them all for real.
