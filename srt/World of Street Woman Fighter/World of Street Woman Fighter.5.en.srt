00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,930
(World of Street Woman Fighter)

2
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,099
(MOTIV has arrived...)

3
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,199
(at Incheon Chinatown!)

4
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,039
All right. So we've been in Incheon for almost a month now,

5
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,479
and I feel like we've been working so hard that we haven't...

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,979
been able to really see what Incheon is about.

7
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,219
So we have a professional tour guide,

8
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,419
- Hey. - Peter Choi, helping us...

9
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,349
just see what Incheon is all about.

10
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,660
(Cheering)

11
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,959
- Hi. - Hi.

12
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,089
Welcome to Incheon.

13
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,159
Thank you.

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,629
Incheon shares a significant historical bond with the US.

15
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,970
(I see.)

16
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,099
- Cool. - Let's do it.

17
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,499
- Shall we get going? - Let's get started.

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,210
- Yes. - Yes.

19
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,340
Anxiety.

20
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,080
(Screaming)

21
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,279
I'm with Marlee Hightower and Bella Olsen.

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,420
What do you guys have to say about Incheon Train Station so far?

23
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,919
I'm excited to see what Incheon has to offer,

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,690
being that we've been here for so long.

25
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,960
It's finally time to see more of the world.

26
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,259
(Excited)

27
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,290
Yes.

28
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,230
- Let's go, Chinatown. - Let's go to Chinatown.

29
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,430
We're in Chinatown in Korea.

30
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,629
(In Chinatown)

31
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,140
- Look around. - Look, guys.

32
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,510
What is this?

33
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,940
Beautiful.

34
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,680
Can we walk through it?

35
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,679
Thank you.

36
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,479
(While strolling through Chinatown, they came across Hanjungwon.)

37
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,550
(A beautiful hideaway nestled inside Chinatown)

38
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,020
I'm going to go in there and sit.

39
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,889
(Seated)

40
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,150
Look at Marlee.

41
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,960
Look at Marlee Hightower.

42
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,260
Hi, Logan.

43
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,159
(Superstar Marlee is recharging emotionally.)

44
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,199
(MOTIV is turning every corner into a fashion shoot.)

45
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,229
(The photos will turn out great, even with zero effort.)

46
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,899
One, two, three.

47
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,069
(After a quick look around, they're on the move.)

48
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,130
Move on?

49
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,640
We did it.

50
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,109
(Why isn't she coming?)

51
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,069
(It looks like Fantaye isn't ready to leave yet.)

52
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,180
So cool.

53
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,810
(So long, Hanjungwon. It was nice seeing you. Now, on to the next!)

54
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,610
It's kind of cool that...

55
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,680
South Korea...

56
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,990
is putting this much into dance,

57
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,220
and is respecting dancers,

58
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,060
and finds it more entertaining.

59
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,089
It's crazy that we get this opportunity.

60
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,029
A little garden.

61
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,129
(Marlee is busy taking pictures.)

62
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,269
This is so pretty. Let's take a picture.

63
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,399
Let's do a selfie.

64
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,069
- Bring it in. - Get in.

65
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,170
Do some...

66
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,770
levels.

67
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,179
(Cheese!)

68
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,610
Three, two, one. Cheese.

69
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,080
Three, two, one. Cheese.

70
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,680
(MOTIV captured a moment together on the picturesque street.)

71
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,350
It's my turn.

72
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,550
Look, it's a doggy.

73
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,219
Camel, I found you a friend.

74
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,129
"Chinese restaurant."

75
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,189
(Next to the Chinese restaurant...)

76
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,759
Look at the details.

77
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,100
- I know, it's... - So cool.

78
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,659
This is a hike.

79
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,869
(It's quite an uphill climb.)

80
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,929
(The Chinatown is filled with refreshing forest air.)

81
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,470
Next mission, go down.

82
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,070
Take a look at the building behind you.

83
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,509
This was the very first place in Korea...

84
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,039
that was established...

85
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,540
as a social club with people from foreign countries.

86
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,879
Let's get inside.

87
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,650
Come on, club.

88
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,850
Party! Yes!

89
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,349
- Into the building. - Into the thick of it.

90
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,350
(Let's walk into the Jemulpo Club!)

91
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:37,660
Into the thick of it!

92
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,589
- Thank you. - Thank you.

93
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,629
(What does Korea's first social club look like on the inside?)

94
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,059
(Once you push open the doors of the Jemulpo Club and step inside, )

95
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,229
(you're greeted by this wide-open space.)

96
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,570
(Spacious)

97
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,539
(Amazed)

98
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,270
Gosh.

99
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,639
This was Korea's first-ever venue for a dance party...

100
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,580
with people from around the world, just like in Street Woman Fighter.

101
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,979
So cool.

102
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,349
(Breaking into a dance out of nowhere)

103
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,150
We should... This is sacred ground.

104
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,650
- Right, this is the fight zone. - The fight zone.

105
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,419
Up the stairs we go.

106
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,389
(MOTIV moves on to the next location.)

107
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,619
Where are we?

108
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,889
(Humming)

109
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,160
Is this like a park?

110
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,690
This is beautiful.

111
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,030
(In awe)

112
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,430
Who is that?

113
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,199
- Who's that guy? - Who's that man?

114
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,329
Who him is?

115
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,170
"Douglas MacArthur."

116
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,010
Douglas MacArthur, general of the army.

117
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,039
(They spotted a statue of a general at the park.)

118
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,579
"There's no boundary in justice."

119
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,309
"Nor is there any obstacle to struggle, mountain or sea."

120
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,079
(They're reading about General MacArthur's legacy...)

121
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,850
(on the statement of dedication.)

122
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,389
(This concludes their tour of Incheon!)

123
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,690
(Now, let's welcome the five crews of WSWF to Korea!)

124
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,489
(The five crews have been...)

125
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:21,889
(grinding nonstop through this fierce competition.)

126
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,360
(A gift for the 5 surviving crews)

127
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,170
(All 5 crews are ready to dive in.)

128
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,700
Period.

129
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,139
(Relieving thirst)

130
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,739
(For a moment, they forget about the competition, )

131
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,009
(letting loose with fun and dance, )

132
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,249
(and taking a well-deserved break.)

133
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,219
(Their free time isn't over yet.)

134
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,679
(We got a free day.)

135
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,589
(So we're going to be shopping for some...)

136
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,649
(K-food.)

137
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,159
(They ate gangjeong...)

138
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,590
(and fishcake, )

139
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,360
(but they're still hungry!)

140
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,289
I'm hungry.

141
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,199
(Put food on my plate.)

142
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,359
(Put the nice ones on my plate.)

143
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,129
(Please hurry. I'm getting dizzy.)

144
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,599
(This lively crew turns their hunger into music.)

145
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,439
(Another lively crew is headed somewhere with excitement.)

146
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,109
(AG SQUAD came to sweep up all the Korean beauty products.)

147
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,309
(They're a bit overwhelmed by the size of the store.)

148
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,849
(Just for a second, though)

149
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,119
(Their shopping instincts kicked in right away.)

150
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,289
(They grab everything they lay eyes on.)

151
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,319
(This is my lip combo.)

152
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,189
(Aaliyah is thrilled.)

153
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,429
(OSAKA Ojo Gang is also obsessed with shopping.)

154
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,829
(This black one)

155
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,930
(Kyoka's pick)

156
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,099
(Junna: This is really nice.)

157
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,169
(A skull on a black jacket, Perfect for a gangster crew member.)

158
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,099
(Meanwhile, the feminine members...)

159
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,199
(Taking pictures is more important than shopping.)

160
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,769
(For Midoris)

161
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,539
(Ibuki is completely absorbed in shopping too.)

162
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,640
Gang!

163
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,339
Gang!

164
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,079
(Totally gangster!)

165
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,849
(Everyone will be scared of us if we show up in these necklaces.)

166
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,919
(Just picturing it got Ibuki overjoyed.)

167
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,789
(Rie Hata is even more exhilarated.)

168
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,120
(Spinning)

169
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,019
(They go back to their childhood innocence.)

170
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,429
(Korean games)

171
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,689
(Korean coin-operated karaoke)

172
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:08,199
(They fully indulge in the Korean cultural experience.)

173
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,129
(How far can we make it?)

174
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,539
(Can we win?)

175
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,970
(They suddenly feel anxious, even while taking a break.)

176
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,810
Gosh.

177
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:17,940
(Please.)

178
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:25,050
(WSWF isn't over yet. What lies ahead for their fate?)

179
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,289
World of Street Woman Fighter is powered by...

180
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:32,019
product sponsorship and partnership with a leading K-culture brand.

181
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,859
(AG SQUAD is enjoying a rare day off.)

182
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,129
(Everyone set out together early in the morning.)

183
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,399
- Goodness. - Gosh.

184
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,869
It's Olive Young, everybody.

185
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,529
(A place that brings smiles to their faces in the morning)

186
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,870
It's so big.

187
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,109
Period. Let's go.

188
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,139
(This trendy place has everything you can imagine.)

189
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,839
Come in, everybody.

190
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,779
Gosh.

191
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,909
(Olive Young N Seongsu is the largest location in Korea.)

192
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,349
Good morning ladies. How's everyone feeling today?

193
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,589
- Great. - Nice.

194
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,989
Awesome. So it's our day off today,

195
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,919
and I really wanted to spoil you guys.

196
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,089
I know you guys love skincare and makeup,

197
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,960
so I wanted to bring you guys to Olive Young.

198
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,489
(Full of excitement)

199
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,969
So we can have fun today and have a little shop around.

200
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,299
(I'm buying today!)

201
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,600
Let's go have some fun and go shopping!

202
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,409
Goodness.

203
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,640
This is so pretty. All of it is.

204
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,010
So pretty.

205
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,609
(They're surprised by how big the store actually is.)

206
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,279
- They do. - Gosh.

207
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,420
- Gosh. - Look at that.

208
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,549
(This is new territory.)

209
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,990
What is this?

210
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,759
Gosh.

211
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,890
(The camera angle with the Gen MZ flair caught their eyes.)

212
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,990
(They can't help but dance in front of a camera.)

213
00:08:42,991 --> 00:08:44,130
- That's crazy. - Look at...

214
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:50,869
(The leader of AG SQUAD is amazed by the Gen MZ camera.)

215
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,600
- Do you like it? - It's purple.

216
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,369
- That's kind of nice. - That's a pretty color.

217
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,539
(Meanwhile, the second oldest member already found a product she likes.)

218
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,879
This is a highlighting stick.

219
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,279
It's pretty.

220
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,980
- That one's nice. - That's nice.

221
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,680
- For us. - Yes.

222
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,049
(She tests out a different shade of the product.)

223
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,449
It is a bronzer.

224
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,289
That's more a contour than a bronzer.

225
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,549
I think bronzers are more...

226
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,890
- Golden, right? - Yes.

227
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,860
This is more like a shadow.

228
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,160
- Shadow. - Yes.

229
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,699
We're going to try on some lipstick.

230
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,299
(She came across Kaleece who is shopping for lipstick.)

231
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,569
(Smacking her lips together)

232
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:26,169
(Alysha and Danica joined them.)

233
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,439
(Kyra is very serious about shopping.)

234
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,109
My crusty lips.

235
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,980
These look so nice.

236
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,750
These are cute. That one's a pretty color.

237
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,820
They look so glossy.

238
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,319
(Same store, completely different experiences)

239
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,459
(Meanwhile, the rookies are lost in the world of perfumes.)

240
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,090
What's the best perfume?

241
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,689
What's the best perfume?

242
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,499
I'm not the biggest perfume person.

243
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,529
I have my go-tos, but like...

244
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,869
- I'm not... - So Kyra uses this.

245
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,929
It's pretty cute.

246
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,599
- Wait, really? - Yes.

247
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,899
That's a full-on piece of chocolate.

248
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,969
- I know. - That's crazy.

249
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,439
Okay. Now I want to smell it.

250
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,470
Let's smell it.

251
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,439
(They're like puppies sniffing around.)

252
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,309
Gosh, it actually smells like chocolate.

253
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,849
And she's such a chocolate girl.

254
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,879
- This is like white chocolate. - I'm so hungry.

255
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,919
- This is like... - Can you put on...

256
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,349
It actually smells like chocolate.

257
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,889
- Put it on me. - Goodness.

258
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,219
(If you can't eat it, spray it.)

259
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,620
(Why eat chocolate, when you can smell like chocolate?)

260
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,430
How do you feel? Okay, your face is going...

261
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,159
- Hi, hello. "G'day, mate?" - G'day, mate?

262
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,369
Did you just say "G'day, mate?"

263
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,499
G'day, mate?

264
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,699
(Where is Kaea sitting with such excitement?)

265
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,199
This is a quick touch-up service.

266
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,669
It takes 15 minutes.

267
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,970
Nice.

268
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,040
(The color she picked out is applied to her lips.)

269
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,279
- Nice. - I really like this.

270
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,449
- That's good. - Yes.

271
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,749
(She even learned how to cover up her dark circles.)

272
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,119
(Meanwhile, Danica is experiencing something as well.)

273
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,789
Do you think you have oily skin or combination skin?

274
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,359
- Combination. Yes. - Combination skin.

275
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,389
(This is the skin analysis station.)

276
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,919
Do you feel any dryness too?

277
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,660
Yes, in winter I do.

278
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:00,029
(Conducting a thorough examination)

279
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,999
- You have some impurities... - Yes.

280
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,069
- and some skin spots. - Yes.

281
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,739
I recommend you start wrinkle care.

282
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,939
- Okay. - Eye wrinkle care.

283
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,939
If you're concerned about the impurities,

284
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,579
you can take care of them too.

285
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,619
Hey, girls. You guys can pick a product,

286
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,449
and it's my treat!

287
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:22,119
(The AG SQUAD members came running.)

288
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,690
- Have faith. - Have some fun.

289
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,690
Get lit.

290
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,219
This is so funny.

291
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,789
These primers look really good. Look, it's...

292
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,899
- Tinted... - Blush.

293
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,399
- That's crazy. - "Sensual."

294
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,430
Too bright. I mean, dark.

295
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,230
Compared to...

296
00:11:36,231 --> 00:11:38,299
(They meticulously check the shades of the products.)

297
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,439
Yes.

298
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,069
(One by one, the members begin to pick out a product.)

299
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,210
- It's too... - I know.

300
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,209
Do you reckon I should get a primer or this one?

301
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,139
In Shade 456.

302
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,309
(Enjoying the peace of being the first one to finish shopping)

303
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,280
This is the "Sensual Fitting Glow Tint."

304
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,519
Nice.

305
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,360
Again, I repeat for you. It's the "Sensual Fitting Glow Tint."

306
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,429
So this is my lip combo.

307
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,089
(My work is done.)

308
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,029
(She makes a cool exit with nothing left to do.)

309
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,699
- Did everyone find something? - Yes.

310
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,370
- Put it in the bag, girls. - Thank you.

311
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,730
Come on.

312
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,730
(There are quite a lot of makeup products in the bag.)

313
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,139
- All right, well... - Nice, ladies.

314
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,240
(With Vanessa's pick being the last product to join the bag...)

315
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,039
Shopping.

316
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,510
Kaea's the best. Come on, Kaea.

317
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,980
- The best boss ever. - I love that.

318
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,679
The best.

319
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,749
- Let's go. - Wait,

320
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,979
I don't think it's a recording.

321
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,980
Is it not?

322
00:12:25,981 --> 00:12:28,119
(Where is AG SQUAD headed next?)

323
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,120
Now.

324
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,619
Goodness. Are you guys scared?

325
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,059
- I'm excited. - I'm excited.

326
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,060
- I'm scared. - I'm going to jump.

327
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,629
- No. - No, you're not.

328
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,699
No, don't be that person.

329
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,129
Can I go on a different one than hers?

330
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,599
(Where are they that everyone is telling Aaliyah not to jump?)

331
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,869
- We're very excited. - We're here.

332
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,569
Wait, it looks so cool.

333
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,440
- It's just like... - Look how pretty...

334
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,039
What the... Okay.

335
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,339
- We're both Korean. - Gosh.

336
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,109
(Eyes lost in anxiety)

337
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,710
- Gosh, this is cramped. - Is this safe?

338
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,649
How many people still...

339
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,979
(Kaea's restless mind and the shaky cable car)

340
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,150
(We'll ensure your safety.)

341
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,649
(She tries her best to smile, )

342
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,619
(but her mind remains unsettled.)

343
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,559
Are we scared? I'm scared.

344
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,690
It really scared me.

345
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,130
I thought we were about to die.

346
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,399
Gosh, I'm scared.

347
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,369
You're okay. Do you want to hold my hand?

348
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,139
(Is fear genetic?)

349
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,539
(Meanwhile, Danica is simply at peace.)

350
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,979
(All that remain are the pictures and videos.)

351
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,479
Look how beautiful that is.

352
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,509
That's scary.

353
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,879
(Taking in the Seoul scenery, )

354
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,549
(they have arrived by cable car at...)

355
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:37,819
(N Seoul Tower, one of Seoul's iconic landmarks.)

356
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,089
(Why did they come here?)

357
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,620
Yummy.

358
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,889
Welcome.

359
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,530
(This is the second activity that Kaea prepared for them.)

360
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,200
- How nice. - Let's eat.

361
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,469
- Okay. - Gosh.

362
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,699
(They can enjoy a hearty dinner here.)

363
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,540
- Super. - Period.

364
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,069
(A high-end Korean restaurant)

365
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,239
Lovely.

366
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,979
Gosh, do you guys like it?

367
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,009
- Yes. - It looks so nice.

368
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,779
Guys, I wanted to bring you guys somewhere special...

369
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,390
because you guys have been working so hard.

370
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,519
- Hope you guys enjoy it. - Thank you.

371
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,860
- What a treat. - What a treat.

372
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,430
This whole day has been such a beautiful day.

373
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,259
So this is the Nam...

374
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,829
(Let's see what's on the menu.)

375
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,429
(The older members check out the menu too.)

376
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,039
- The soup. - The noodles.

377
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,710
(Just reading the menu makes their mouths water.)

378
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,310
Gosh.

379
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,910
Goodness, what is this?

380
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,350
(Stunned)

381
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,880
Goodness.

382
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,680
Gosh, this is so fancy.

383
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,649
- Are we allowed to take photos? - Sure.

384
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,549
- Yes. - We have to.

385
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,660
- I get why... - Wait, I want to take a photo.

386
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,029
- If you don't want to... - That's crazy.

387
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:51,859
Gosh, it looks so gorgeous.

388
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,329
- Although I'm not sure this... - Gorgeous.

389
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,270
My friend's a photographer, and he...

390
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,399
- He says to go to 0.2 - How do I... 0.2?

391
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,609
- I mean, 2.0. - Wait. Okay.

392
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,370
And then go right above it.

393
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,740
- This is okay. - Gosh.

394
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,910
Okay.

395
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,280
I don't know what we're starting with here.

396
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,919
Yum.

397
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,950
It's like soup.

398
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,019
(The youngest member loves it too.)

399
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,290
It tastes like my grandmother's pumpkin soup.

400
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,460
What do you do with this one? You wrap it up?

401
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,130
- Put it... Eat it with this. - Eat in one bite.

402
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,829
(Place the yukhoe on a laver crisp.)

403
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,100
This is going to be great.

404
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,240
Yum.

405
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:33,269
(Perfectly passing the frown test)

406
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,709
I love raw meat.

407
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,809
- Gosh. - Gosh.

408
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,969
- Really? - She loves it.

409
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,809
Yes, it's beautiful.

410
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,610
- I love it with pear. - Gosh.

411
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,149
- The flavors. - Like Asian pear.

412
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,179
(Vanessa knows the proper way to eat yukhoe.)

413
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,219
(Aaliyah is eating straight from the plate.)

414
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,850
(Clear)

415
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,989
Amazing. Thank you.

416
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,090
You're not going to eat that?

417
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,089
I don't think so. You can have it.

418
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,229
(Yes!)

419
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,960
Whatever you don't eat, I'm here.

420
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,059
(Make me the master of finishing your leftovers, Danica.)

421
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,329
(An employee showed up with something in his hands.)

422
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:04,799
Excuse me. We'll be serving traditional Korean liquor pairings.

423
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,770
The first one is yuzu liquor.

424
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,609
(They're provided traditional Korean liquor pairing with their foods.)

425
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:13,040
This is ginseng. Sweet ginseng.

426
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,349
Nice.

427
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,409
(Vanessa is more focused on the sound of ginseng.)

428
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,479
Come on, health.

429
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,879
It's tradition to just have some and cheers.

430
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,619
But if you don't feel comfortable drinking, just pass it on...

431
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,119
to Ruth. Jokes.

432
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,820
(Just joking)

433
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,160
But it's like a tradition to say, "Cheers."

434
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,760
Pass it to me.

435
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,100
Let's toast, everyone. What should we say?

436
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,269
- Cheers to the beginning... - Cheers to the beginning.

437
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,769
- of AG SQUAD. - Yes.

438
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:39,839
I just got goosebumps.

439
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,639
Cheers to the beginning of AG SQUAD.

440
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,240
- Cheers, everybody. Eye contact. - Cheers.

441
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,910
Eye contact.

442
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,009
- Cheers. - Eye contact.

443
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,209
All of us.

444
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,949
You've never done the eye contact?

445
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,379
I didn't get yours.

446
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,990
Three, two, one.

447
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,819
(They all sip the drink.)

448
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,659
- I'm feeling... - It's nice.

449
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,659
- Yummy. - That's so good.

450
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,029
How cool.

451
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,500
Five more, please.

452
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,629
(Her joke became a prophecy.)

453
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:13,840
Okay. What's everybody's highlight of this trip so far?

454
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,509
We'll go around.

455
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,970
Okay. We'll start with Kyra.

456
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,409
I think the peak was...

457
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,480
winning the choreography challenge in our middle class.

458
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,219
It was like the roughest process.

459
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,479
It was like an eight-hour process for us.

460
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,449
It was very brutal.

461
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,660
We had to argue with a lot of people.

462
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,620
To win that, I think for us, was cool.

463
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,859
The downside is that we lost it, but hey.

464
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,559
- We still won it. - We still won it.

465
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,199
We won the choreography.

466
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,330
That's my peak.

467
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,469
- We love that. - Thanks, Kyra.

468
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,200
(They all applaud Kyra for her efforts.)

469
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,700
My first one was your battle.

470
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,109
Yes. The battle.

471
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,539
(We know it even if you don't say it.)

472
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,740
That's one of my favorite moments.

473
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,110
Secondly, it would be... I think...

474
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,949
I loved being around so many different energies,

475
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,450
not just us.

476
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,790
We were around so many people from all over the world.

477
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,260
I felt very inspired. That was another...

478
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,890
Definitely.

479
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,760
I loved that.

480
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,900
I have a few.

481
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,099
My favorite would be watching everyone's battles.

482
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,410
Your battles. It was so nice watching them.

483
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,439
It was like, "I'm so proud."

484
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,739
When you're watching someone dance, you're like,

485
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,209
"These girls are so good."

486
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,980
That's probably my favorite, to be honest. It was cool.

487
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,649
- And dancing with my sister. - Gosh.

488
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:34,949
Did you get told to say that?

489
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,589
No! Dancing with my sister.

490
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,759
- Gosh. - So nice.

491
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,990
And with everyone. It was cool.

492
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,229
It was nice. Let's eat.

493
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,300
(The dinner goes on in warm spirits.)

494
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,169
- So pretty. - So good.

495
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,030
Look at the beautiful...

496
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,069
- sun. - Sunset.

497
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,839
(The beautiful sunset in Seoul is right before their eyes.)

498
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,710
The time of the day...

499
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,009
(They all take out their phones.)

500
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:04,080
(She also records a video.)

501
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,049
I love the sunset.

502
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,320
The color.

503
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,449
(They enjoy their meal with the view.)

504
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:14,689
(The sky quickly turns dark.)

505
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,059
(It's soon dark in the restaurant.)

506
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:20,129
Who was your favorite person from this season?

507
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,430
- Aiki. - Aiki.

508
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,669
- Go, Aiki. - Aiki.

509
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,199
- Aiki. - Kyoka.

510
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,339
Fantaye.

511
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,539
- Fantaye. - Oh, my gosh.

512
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,910
- Fantaye. - They're so pretty.

513
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,810
Fantaye is cool.

514
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,209
(Thinking)

515
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,210
I love Aiki.

516
00:19:35,211 --> 00:19:36,349
- She's so funny. - I love Aiki.

517
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,220
When everyone stopped, and she was like...

518
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,120
(Aiki doesn't hold back.)

519
00:19:40,121 --> 00:19:41,849
She's so funny.

520
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:45,220
- That's my favorite moment. - She was like...

521
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:49,529
And all of BUMSUP. They had massive followers.

522
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,329
- Like massive. - Yes.

523
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,029
Like in the industry.

524
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,000
And then you just talk to them, and they're like...

525
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,200
Everyone is so nice even though they look scary.

526
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,369
I think all dancers look a bit scary.

527
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,270
- But they're not as... - Us too.

528
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,739
Definitely. They thought we were evil...

529
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,339
- when they first met us. - Yes.

530
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,609
- When we first... - The way we walked in.

531
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,280
I wish we could have redone that walking.

532
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,649
We should have been like, "Hold on a minute."

533
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,119
(The Curious Case of Kyra)

534
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,789
(Turning back time)

535
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,059
(AG SQUAD entering cheerfully?)

536
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,489
(She wants to redo it like this.)

537
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,999
When the show comes out,

538
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,460
that would be showing way more...

539
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,699
than what we saw on the screen.

540
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,939
When it comes out, they'll be showing us saying...

541
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,170
- everything. - That's what I'm scared about.

542
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,339
- We're doomed. - Canceled.

543
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,340
Cancel.

544
00:20:38,341 --> 00:20:39,580
(The dish to turn the mood around is here.)

545
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,410
What is this?

546
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,979
- The main? - The main dish is ready.

547
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,679
We have a performance, so if you want to take a video...

548
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,689
Yes!

549
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,089
(She takes out her phone right away.)

550
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,959
(I should record performances.)

551
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,790
- Work. - Ready?

552
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,960
- Yes. - Ready.

553
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:56,460
One, two, three.

554
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,959
(The beautiful dish is revealed.)

555
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,229
(The scene of discovering something special)

556
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,199
(The audience are 5,000 percent satisfied.)

557
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,300
Are you going to dance?

558
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,509
(The stage effects are perfect for dancing.)

559
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,510
Period.

560
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,179
(Various parts of Korean beef)

561
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,609
That's incredible.

562
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,709
(It was seared over charcoal and delicately grilled.)

563
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:19,319
(Flavorful grilled Korean beef)

564
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,289
(It was served after being cut into bite sizes.)

565
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:27,459
(It's a perfectly laid-out table.)

566
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:32,529
(Their chopstick skills have suddenly improved.)

567
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,629
(She first tries the meat.)

568
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,969
(Fainting)

569
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,439
(It tastes amazing.)

570
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,599
Is it good?

571
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,610
Yes.

572
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,909
Sorry. We use our hands in Australia.

573
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,539
(No need to say that in a country of wraps.)

574
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,049
That would be amazing.

575
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:51,479
(She has already made a wrap.)

576
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,319
(She places meat on top of the wrap vegetable.)

577
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,219
(She folds it well...)

578
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,589
(and puts it in her mouth.)

579
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:02,459
(Korean wrap with a different taste)

580
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,489
(Something is missing.)

581
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,590
It needs more.

582
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,899
Wrap the lettuce with the garlic.

583
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,600
And then the orange stuff.

584
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,669
(She found the ssamjang.)

585
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:12,770
You wrap it in?

586
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,609
With this little thing. Wait.

587
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,610
(She sprinkles salt as well.)

588
00:22:16,611 --> 00:22:17,869
Try it.

589
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:18,909
(It's a perfect wrap.)

590
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,040
Tipsy wipsy.

591
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,250
(It goes into her mouth again.)

592
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,880
This food is unreal.

593
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,679
- It's so good. - We're going to sleep...

594
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,790
like babies tonight.

595
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,959
(While the older members share the wrap recipe...)

596
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,559
(The younger members are focused on eating.)

597
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,229
(Exclaiming)

598
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,759
(She's not angry.)

599
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,929
(She enjoys the garlic too.)

600
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:48,309
(She also eats the wrap vegetables like salad.)

601
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:52,280
(One by one, the plates get emptied.)

602
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:56,210
Is there any K-pop artist you want to work with?

603
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,680
Probably Lisa.

604
00:22:57,681 --> 00:22:59,349
(That's an unexpected lineup.)

605
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,350
She's pretty cool.

606
00:23:00,351 --> 00:23:02,489
When I met her and taught her back when she was training,

607
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,859
she was pretty cool. She's not even Korean.

608
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,859
She came here and learned Korean and everything...

609
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,060
while she was training.

610
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,830
She's pretty cool.

611
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,460
I'd like to dance with CL again.

612
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,030
- I really like her. - She's pretty cool.

613
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,499
I was watching "HELLO" last night.

614
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,669
It was so cool.

615
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,409
(We were cool then too.)

616
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,470
Even aespa.

617
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,379
- Honestly, - Working with aespa would be cool.

618
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,109
- they're so cool. - The team will be great.

619
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,979
(They chat about working with aespa.)

620
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,680
Come on, aespa. Hire us.

621
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,520
We'll do a whole clip.

622
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,190
Choreography.

623
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,490
Dancing.

624
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,020
Dancing.

625
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,559
Styling.

626
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,790
Styling.

627
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,359
(The buzz is just a bonus.)

628
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,430
So...

629
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,830
Call us, aespa.

630
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,799
So how is everyone feeling about future missions?

631
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,369
- So excited. - We're going to come back.

632
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,370
- We're coming back. - So excited...

633
00:23:56,371 --> 00:23:57,839
- for the Mega Crew. - So excited.

634
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,279
The Mega Crew Mission is next.

635
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,879
That was one of my favorite parts of watching last season.

636
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,819
- The Mega Crew. - Mega Crew.

637
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,180
I'm excited.

638
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,519
It's a big mission.

639
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,819
I'm excited because they're going to see...

640
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,149
something completely different.

641
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,219
- They're going to see more of us... - Yes.

642
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,689
Because this was the first time we danced as a crew.

643
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,689
So now, they can see what we can do with our crew...

644
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,200
plus extra.

645
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,830
And we have...

646
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,330
people from so many different backgrounds.

647
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,009
Having you guys come from doing mega crews a lot.

648
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,040
- Like that's... - Yes.

649
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:33,739
We have the upper hand. Definitely.

650
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,109
- One hundred percent. - I want to start now.

651
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,649
So I feel like we have got this.

652
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:41,250
Fans have been so supportive.

653
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:44,120
And every single comment has been positive.

654
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,760
Every comment has been like, "We're going to win."

655
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,460
I'm so confident in us that we can do this.

656
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,029
Yes. Cheers to us, everybody!

657
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,870
- Cheers. - Cheers.

658
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:58,469
AG SQUAD on three! One, two, three!

659
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,540
- AG SQUAD! - AG SQUAD!

660
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,269
(The members have grown closer while spending the day together.)

661
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,510
- In to... - Period.

662
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,380
All right.

663
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,349
(The lights don't go off in Seoul.)

664
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,509
The last training day is over.

665
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:13,619
(What's the last course tonight?)

666
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,049
- It was a lot before. - Yes.

667
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,089
I want ice cream.

668
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,319
Goodness.

669
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,320
Yes!

670
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,659
- What? - What is it?

671
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,359
Is it like the one before?

672
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,930
Exciting.

673
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,900
Okay, ladies. We've got a surprise for you.

674
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,970
(The leader prepared the locks as well.)

675
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:36,039
- We should have an AG SQUAD one. - Is it like the one before?

676
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,410
So let's lock them.

677
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:39,610
Let's go.

678
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,849
- Ruthy... - This is beautiful.

679
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:42,850
Goodness.

680
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:47,020
(They scatter and each write their wishes.)

681
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,020
AG SQUAD to win.

682
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,690
That's my wish.

683
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,930
AG SQUAD to win.

684
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,099
(She fastens the lock bearing an earnest wish.)

685
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,100
Period.

686
00:26:02,101 --> 00:26:03,529
(Ruthy Baby takes a picture of the memory.)

687
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,530
Nothing.

688
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,870
It's a secret because it's a wish.

689
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,139
It's so cool because you can just connect it...

690
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,009
with someone else's. So cool.

691
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,909
(She writes her wish until the end.)

692
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,979
That is so cool.

693
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,509
(Mom's lock with the names of her three children)

694
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,420
May the Almighty continue to bless our relationship.

695
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,849
My family, my partner, my mom, my niece,

696
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,660
and AG SQUAD.

697
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:32,000
(They all fasten the locks with their wishes.)

698
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,729
(The youngest member also fastens her lock.)

699
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,170
Ladies, it was such a good day today.

700
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,969
It was an awesome quality time together,

701
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,209
and let's go home!

702
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,639
- Let's go! - Let's go!

703
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,340
- AG SQUAD! - SQUAD!

704
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,279
- AG SQUAD! - AG SQUAD!

705
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,979
- AG SQUAD! - AG SQUAD!

706
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,179
(They all shout their crew name.)

707
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,350
(AG SQUAD wraps up the day.)

708
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,920
(She doesn't miss the chance to get the final shot.)

709
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,059
(What do you think?)

710
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,359
(My sharp jawline)

711
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,489
(My high nose bridge)

712
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,889
(Have you...)

713
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,460
(fallen for me?)

714
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,529
(They get their first vacation after the tough missions.)

715
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,399
- What is this? - Ice skating?

716
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,539
(They make all kinds of guesses.)

717
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:18,169
The place I wanted to bring everyone to...

718
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,180
is the sauna.

719
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,609
(When you say sauna...)

720
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,349
(Charcoal kiln sauna)

721
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,419
(You have to sweat, )

722
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,819
(play games, )

723
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,049
(get some rest, )

724
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,289
(eat, )

725
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:31,450
(and play.)

726
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:37,359
(We'll enjoy it to the fullest!)

727
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,499
- Yes! - Hello.

728
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,060
- Hello. - Hello.

729
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,929
(Ready to sweat with the sheep towel rolls and in sauna clothes.)

730
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,670
It's amazing.

731
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,609
(It's hot.)

732
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:52,240
(The heat welcomes RH Tokyo.)

733
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:55,610
(They all find a comfortable place to sit.)

734
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,250
It's the best.

735
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,310
(Moving)

736
00:27:58,311 --> 00:28:00,019
(She lies down in a comfortable position.)

737
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,989
(She falls asleep.)

738
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,519
(Sleep is contagious.)

739
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,160
(Sleep is contagious.)

740
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,360
It makes me remember this. "You..."

741
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,700
"Your future is open."

742
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,099
"You're amazing."

743
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,800
"You're an amazing person."

744
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,810
(Together with ASMR sounds)

745
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:27,009
(They get some sleep that they would have been lacking.)

746
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:30,650
I will protect Reina and Rena.

747
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,950
I will protect them.

748
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,950
(What is this situation?)

749
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:39,320
(After warming up their bodies, )

750
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,689
(RH Tokyo was fully charged.)

751
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,699
(Also, )

752
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,669
(They eventually...)

753
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:51,029
(start playing the apartment game to decide who goes...)

754
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,399
(inside the 100°C charcoal kiln.)

755
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,170
(Game start)

756
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,469
Five.

757
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:00,509
(She starts the 1st round lightly with 5.)

758
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,510
- Three. - Four.

759
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,079
(Gosh)

760
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,189
(Rena lost.)

761
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:12,260
(Who will go with Rena?)

762
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,620
Seven.

763
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,059
(It's Rie!)

764
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,659
I want to go in.

765
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,400
(Deciding the last person)

766
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,429
(The tower goes up high in the last round.)

767
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,070
- Seventeen! - Eighteen!

768
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,470
It's me!

769
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,839
Ms. Bungeoppang.

770
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,709
Ms. Bungeoppang lost.

771
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:35,249
(Let's go and heat the bungeoppangs.)

772
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,150
- We'll get going. - We'll get going.

773
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,150
(They set off.)

774
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,820
Hold on.

775
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,790
Hold on.

776
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,619
(Covering her mouth)

777
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,089
(It's Rena's first time in a sauna.)

778
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,090
It's hot!

779
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,629
(She's looking for a chance to escape.)

780
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:57,570
When you're in a sauna...

781
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,300
(She nods without knowing what it is.)

782
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,069
(Reina holds a towel...)

783
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,739
(and flaps it.)

784
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,880
(Flapping)

785
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,220
It's hot!

786
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,080
(Glaring)

787
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:16,750
Rena and Rie together now.

788
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,260
(Why me?)

789
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,829
(She tries it again.)

790
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:27,229
(But it's just hot.)

791
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:31,169
(But Master Rie remains calm.)

792
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,440
(I'm getting inspired.)

793
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,479
(Amazing.)

794
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,879
(It seems this place suits the Master perfectly.)

795
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,149
I'm sorry. I'll get out first.

796
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,550
I'm sorry. We'll get going.

797
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,979
It's hot!

798
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,290
But there's no one here.

799
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,419
(Where is this place? Who am I?)

800
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,020
(And Rie Hata is left alone.)

801
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,330
(Why is she doing this?)

802
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:08,239
(It didn't seem like it would end.)

803
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,179
(So it was forcefully terminated.)

804
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,579
(Rie Hata is finally out in the world.)

805
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,610
There's a kids' room.

806
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,920
(There are many things to play in the kids' room.)

807
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,989
While the adults rest,

808
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,690
the children can rest here.

809
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,769
(The whale smiles as if it found the right person.)

810
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,799
I want to jump on this.

811
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,370
(Something else draws Rena's attention.)

812
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,970
- Is it fun? - Yes.

813
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,940
- Should we do it together? - Yes.

814
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,979
(Screaming)

815
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,209
(She applies to join.)

816
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,509
(Me too.)

817
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:53,249
(The group becomes bigger to join the fun.)

818
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,889
- Look. - We're looking.

819
00:31:55,890 --> 00:32:02,630
(The experienced kids' room user turns the millstone.)

820
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,960
I feel dizzy.

821
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,730
Try this, Rena.

822
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,699
(She makes Rena sit.)

823
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,170
(The Rie ride starts!)

824
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:17,169
(That looks fun.)

825
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,570
(Feeling happy)

826
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,909
(It's my turn.)

827
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,710
I'll push it, Rie.

828
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,049
It's okay. It's relaxing.

829
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,820
(Here we go.)

830
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,760
(Turning)

831
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:40,699
(The experienced kids' room user also takes over the trampoline.)

832
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,670
One, two, three, jump!

833
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:47,899
(She plays with the children with her expert skills.)

834
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,909
(Meanwhile, they are having fun at the karaoke.)

835
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,639
(Tokyo)

836
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,879
(The 2nd round of the gathering)

837
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,819
(The employees sing energetically.)

838
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,379
Hey!

839
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,449
(Rico Hirai, 2001, The manager in high spirits)

840
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:07,819
(The CEO joins them in the 3rd round.)

841
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,259
(This song is known by all generations.)

842
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,729
(A nostalgic song of youth longing for past love)

843
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:17,099
(Your voice)

844
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:21,439
(Still echoes in my heart)

845
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,810
(That is the shadow where love wanders)

846
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,110
(Let's eat.)

847
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,449
(The red meat...)

848
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:35,389
(is grilled over the smoky flame.)

849
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,389
(The pork belly is ready.)

850
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,859
Lettuce.

851
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:42,389
(Hesitating)

852
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,459
- Thank you. - Lettuce.

853
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,859
(She holds the lettuce she carefully picked.)

854
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,259
(She adds two pieces of meat and lots of ssamjang.)

855
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,900
(The Rena wrap is complete.)

856
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,639
(It's delicious.)

857
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,769
(Nina also eats a wrap.)

858
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:58,780
(Eye-opening)

859
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,880
It's good.

860
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,210
(She likes it.)

861
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,320
- The meat is tasty. - It is.

862
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:08,890
- It was a good choice. - It's delicious.

863
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:12,219
(They're almost done with their satisfactory meal.)

864
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,259
It's delicious.

865
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,559
It's already been 10 years since we 1st entered...

866
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,790
a competition as RH Tokyo.

867
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,759
It was exactly ten years ago.

868
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,169
I couldn't dance back then...

869
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,570
because I was pregnant.

870
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:27,099
But there were many students.

871
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,240
Asuka, Rena, Ako, and Reina...

872
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,039
were taking my lessons.

873
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,850
"Would you like to enter the competition without me?

874
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,210
How old were you then?

875
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:40,449
I was in seventh grade.

876
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:41,979
(She's shocked.)

877
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,189
- Grade six. - Grade six.

878
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,819
I was in seventh grade...

879
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,589
- Grade nine. - Right.

880
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:51,589
(They've been together since they were young.)

881
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,329
It was like a reunion with Rico.

882
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,800
Meeting Rico as an adult.

883
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,940
I remember the audition.

884
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:03,010
"I actually took lessons from Rie before."

885
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:06,139
(She can't deny it.)

886
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,609
At first, I thought she was a hot girl from Osaka.

887
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,580
But when she started talking...

888
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,950
"I actually took lessons from Rie before."

889
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,819
"I decided myself..."

890
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,089
"that I had to grow."

891
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:21,120
(She looks just like her.)

892
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,789
"I made up my mind."

893
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:25,229
I'm good at speaking like a Kansai person.

894
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,400
(I agree.)

895
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,699
After the audition, Rie said...

896
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,539
to the RH Tokyo members...

897
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,980
(I found someone amazing.)

898
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,080
(Rico's presence quickly showed despite her late join.)

899
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,649
We came to gather through many encounters.

900
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:51,319
Rena was on Season Two,

901
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,659
and I was the judge.

902
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,689
I was friends with Akanen, and everyone participated.

903
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:00,199
I never thought Season Three...

904
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,959
would be a worldwide version.

905
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,429
Honestly, I didn't want to participate.

906
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,439
I said several times you should participate...

907
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,970
without me.

908
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,540
But in the end,

909
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,609
I decided to participate...

910
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,579
after hearing that the seven of you...

911
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,320
really wanted to do this.

912
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:24,449
"If they want to do it so much, I want to do it with them."

913
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:28,259
It made me get that motivation.

914
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,089
That's why I decided to participate.

915
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:35,200
(That's how RH Tokyo became complete.)

916
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,400
Well...

917
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:39,170
Since I'm here...

918
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:42,100
and I'm dancing in the same crew...

919
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,509
with the people I respected,

920
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,110
I'm doing it with a desperate heart.

921
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,780
It felt like I was constantly racing.

922
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,550
I hadn't been feeling that for a while.

923
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:54,419
We tried to create something with this energy...

924
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,020
and practiced it.

925
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,890
It was really hard to catch up.

926
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,589
(They agree.)

927
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:04,830
So you could think, "Are you not motivated?"

928
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,900
I was angry too.

929
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,630
But that's probably...

930
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,900
because our motivation was up when everyone was the same.

931
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,769
That's why we could think, "Why aren't you practicing?"

932
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,939
(She suddenly apologizes.)

933
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:23,909
(While Rico asks for forgiveness...)

934
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,979
(Where are these two?)

935
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:29,420
We are secretly...

936
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:33,789
(They prepared a birthday party for Nina and Rico.)

937
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,889
(They filled the paper with words for them.)

938
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,889
(They get a cake with lots of strawberries.)

939
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:41,229
(They're ready.)

940
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:43,129
Don't look into their eyes.

941
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:45,029
Should I congratulate them as soon as we enter?

942
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,070
(They make the final check.)

943
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,739
(They enter the venue.)

944
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,409
(2 seconds left)

945
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:55,910
(Happy birthday to you)

946
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:06,390
- Happy birthday dear Nina and Rico - Happy birthday dear Nina and Rico

947
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:10,360
(Happy birthday to you)

948
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,500
Please make a wish.

949
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,599
(They hold hands.)

950
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,440
(For RH Tokyo's health, happiness, long life, victory, success, etc...)

951
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:32,049
(They take pictures too.)

952
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:36,289
(They're ready to give the letters.)

953
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:39,119
- Also. - Also...

954
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,790
With love for you two, we prepared...

955
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:47,729
message cards!

956
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:52,200
(The tear button is on.)

957
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,240
Congratulations.

958
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:59,280
(Thank you.)

959
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,180
Thank you so much.

960
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:03,680
Really.

961
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:06,079
Thank you...

962
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,179
- for accepting me. - Don't say that.

963
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,180
(Endless gratitude)

964
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,460
So...

965
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,829
(It's difficult from the beginning.)

966
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,960
(Bringing out funny thoughts.)

967
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:23,070
So...

968
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:27,000
I went to Rie's audition...

969
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,810
for the first time in grade eight.

970
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:33,180
That...

971
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,510
made me really happy.

972
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,150
No.

973
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:49,360
I didn't write anything else...

974
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,290
in the student book.

975
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,629
I only checked the day of my tennis match...

976
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,969
and the day I was going to meet Rie.

977
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,169
(Meeting Rie)

978
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:01,539
(She waited for the day to meet Rie.)

979
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,640
I recently found...

980
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,580
that notebook while moving.

981
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,910
That's when I realized...

982
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:14,020
everything I had done so far...

983
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,850
was connected.

984
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,289
And I thought so many times how it was a relief...

985
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:20,390
that I didn't give up.

986
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:25,930
That's how I came to the place I dreamed of coming.

987
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,030
So thank you.

988
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,399
(Laughing)

989
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,670
(She's a bit embarrassed.)

990
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,780
This is so lovely.

991
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,279
In these clothes that look like gym clothes.

992
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,049
(A weird combination of gym clothes, party cones, and tears)

993
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:50,549
They have the party cones...

994
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,589
(They're like members who came to congratulate...)

995
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,019
(their retirement game.)

996
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,290
Could we take a picture?

997
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:58,330
A group picture with everyone.

998
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:11,969
(One spring day with tears and snot)

999
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,479
(A cold day in March)

1000
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,010
(Before the shooting of WSWF)

1001
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:21,619
I hope it's a great place.

1002
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,990
Doesn't it look great?

1003
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,419
(Eerie bell sounds...)

1004
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,960
(and colorful clothes)

1005
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,690
It's quite noisy outside.

1006
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:36,830
(This place is filled with ritual tools.)

1007
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,029
(BUMSUP came to a shrine...)

1008
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:43,839
(to have their future read.)

1009
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,339
Take it off.

1010
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,839
- Do you take it off? - Take it off.

1011
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,179
(BUMSUP arrived at the shrine.)

1012
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,380
I'm scared.

1013
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:51,750
- Let's do this. - Is this real?

1014
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:53,850
- Why... - It's real.

1015
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,220
Real!

1016
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,159
- Hello. - Hello.

1017
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,589
Hello.

1018
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,389
(Welcome.)

1019
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,689
- Hello. - Hello.

1020
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,999
Hello.

1021
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,529
The crybabies are here.

1022
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:09,730
Crybabies?

1023
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,539
- Will we be crying a lot? - Will we?

1024
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,569
Will we be crying a lot?

1025
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:16,570
- Let's do our best! - We'll do our best!

1026
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:19,940
We're the best!

1027
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:22,540
Sit down.

1028
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:26,279
- Hello. - Hello.

1029
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,879
- Hello. - It's nice to meet you.

1030
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,389
It's nice to meet you.

1031
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:32,960
Hello. I'm General Baekma of Juhyeon Shrine,

1032
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,690
a shaman in my fourth year.

1033
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,530
- Hello. - Hello.

1034
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,359
- Hello. - It's an honor.

1035
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,760
One, two, three.

1036
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,100
- With the tiger's spirit, BUMSUP. - With the tiger's spirit, BUMSUP.

1037
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:44,929
That's who we are.

1038
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,269
We're BUMSUP.

1039
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:48,239
BUMSUP is the name?

1040
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,339
Yes. BUMSUP.

1041
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,270
Meaning you can't approach carelessly?

1042
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:53,579
- This is an international stage. - Right.

1043
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:56,610
The sound of the international stage continues for a long time.

1044
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,849
- A long time? - A long time?

1045
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:03,550
It will be a buzz for a long time.

1046
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,589
I guess it will last for a long time.

1047
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:09,090
- It goes on for a long time. - I guess it works out.

1048
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:12,389
How are we compatible?

1049
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,830
Between the members.

1050
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,930
First of all, the leader is good.

1051
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:21,839
- Work, baby. - Honey J.

1052
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,370
Honey J.

1053
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:24,940
The leader is determined.

1054
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:27,779
- That's right. - You can feel that.

1055
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,750
- I feel that. - I can really feel that.

1056
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,780
But there's this thing.

1057
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:33,780
All of you are leaders.

1058
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,679
But what happens when there are too many cooks?

1059
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,089
- It spoils the broth. - Right.

1060
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:41,219
She could be right or she could be wrong,

1061
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,590
but a king is always a king.

1062
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:44,830
- First listen to her. - Okay.

1063
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:47,230
You're the icon of sacrifice.

1064
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,430
- That's right. - That's who you are.

1065
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,440
You liked helping others ever since you were 7 or 8.

1066
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,999
You didn't like seeing others cry.

1067
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,209
- You have to give them yours. - Someone will cry.

1068
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:00,309
- Someone will cry. - You're the icon of sacrifice.

1069
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:01,880
Goodness.

1070
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,349
She's teary.

1071
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,450
Can I cry already?

1072
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,779
- You have to take the blame. - That's right.

1073
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:11,220
- You have to be the one to be hurt. - Right.

1074
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:13,690
"It's better for me to be in pain than others."

1075
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,459
- That's right. - Right.

1076
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,759
- Really? - I'd rather bear the pain.

1077
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,959
- Really? - I'm going to cry.

1078
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,629
- Don't get hurt. - Honey J.

1079
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:20,830
I'm suddenly kneeling down.

1080
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:23,229
She will be crying.

1081
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,469
- No. I won't cry. - Okay.

1082
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:28,439
She's stronger than you think. The king has to be strong.

1083
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,709
She's strong.

1084
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:31,139
- Right. - She's strong.

1085
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,880
The best of the best.

1086
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,910
You two would be good friends.

1087
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,780
I guess we aren't friends yet.

1088
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,680
We have known each other for 20 years.

1089
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:42,919
- You're still in the process. - Someone...

1090
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,219
- Someone was faking it. - had a different...

1091
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,989
These two never cross each other's line.

1092
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:49,059
(They agree.)

1093
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,990
- That's right. - Correct.

1094
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:52,690
They never go to war.

1095
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,200
They don't fight.

1096
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,830
"You're like that? I'm like this."

1097
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:57,930
"You'll do that? I'll do this."

1098
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:00,670
- That's right. - That's true.

1099
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,370
They're enemies but friends for life.

1100
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:06,609
- That's true. - It's true.

1101
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:07,610
(She's next.)

1102
00:45:07,611 --> 00:45:08,779
You're a flame...

1103
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,510
- that doesn't go out. - Yes.

1104
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:13,249
Whether you like it or not,

1105
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,220
you're respected everywhere.

1106
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:20,160
That makes you feel uncomfortable. You want to put it down.

1107
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,259
- You want to be free. - That's right.

1108
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:25,289
But you have to think you were born wearing a uniform.

1109
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:26,359
- Goodness. - Goodness.

1110
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,199
- "I look coolest in a uniform." - I get that feeling.

1111
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,429
- Your easygoing side... - Right.

1112
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:32,199
Could be shown to your family...

1113
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,370
and your friends.

1114
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,100
Just live like that.

1115
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:37,670
My dream was to be like Aiki.

1116
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:40,540
- No. - I can't live like her, right?

1117
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,709
- No. - She said no.

1118
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:45,550
I don't know anything, but that shouldn't happen.

1119
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,579
- Right. That can't happen. - That's not right.

1120
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:48,679
- I want to be funny. - No.

1121
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,519
- That's not right. - But you change a lot...

1122
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,750
after you give birth to a child.

1123
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,059
- What changes? - Come here.

1124
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,459
What changes?

1125
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,029
- Right. - You would become softer.

1126
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:01,660
The way you speak and your emotions.

1127
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,669
You learn through your child.

1128
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:06,439
You're learning...

1129
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,809
- That's right. - how valuable something is.

1130
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:11,639
You talk to yourself.

1131
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,809
"I have to live like this."

1132
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:14,640
I always hear her talking to herself.

1133
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,409
Seriously.

1134
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:17,949
Does she talk to herself every day?

1135
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:20,280
- I hear her talk to herself. - She was inspired.

1136
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,319
"I don't think I should live like this."

1137
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,050
"I think I should do this."

1138
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:28,859
"I think I should do something good."

1139
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,760
She takes the lead in that.

1140
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:34,160
It will be the most nerve-racking moment of her life.

1141
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,430
I'm very nervous.

1142
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,399
I always give birth in my dreams.

1143
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,839
(Summary: Precious life and Monika 2.0 are soon to come)

1144
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,470
- It's okay. - Right.

1145
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:44,209
This lady is very curious.

1146
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:46,810
You're impulsive and stand out.

1147
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:51,250
Because on both sides of you, there are babies following you.

1148
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,480
You have to enjoy yourself first.

1149
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,549
- She's right. - That's so true.

1150
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:58,149
Leejung has to have fun herself.

1151
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:00,359
- "Is it already time?" - This is crazy.

1152
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,689
"Do we have to leave? I want to stay a bit longer."

1153
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:04,289
"Let's hang out more with me."

1154
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:05,589
- This is a bit... - Leejung always says this.

1155
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:06,799
- It's the same. - She doesn't want to go home.

1156
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,129
"I want to stay longer."

1157
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:09,569
"Are you going to leave?"

1158
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:10,899
"Are you going home?"

1159
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,499
- "Are you already leaving?" - She takes us places.

1160
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,000
(I love myself)

1161
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:19,509
I love myself

1162
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:21,909
- That's so true. - I love myself

1163
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:23,349
- That's true. - Oh, my gosh.

1164
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:26,919
(It's not done yet.)

1165
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,579
(I'm sexy)

1166
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:29,889
(I love bottoms)

1167
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,250
- This is hilarious. - Oh, my!

1168
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,559
Oh, my gosh!

1169
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,420
- This is crazy. - It's so true.

1170
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,190
That's how you live.

1171
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:39,530
You were a princess in your past life.

1172
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,959
You were a princess or a queen in your past life.

1173
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,429
Oh, my gosh!

1174
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:45,230
- Oh, my! - Unbelievable.

1175
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,340
I'm a princess.

1176
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:51,769
But you've trained a lot.

1177
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:53,139
- Yes. - Yes!

1178
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:55,710
You've worked hard for yourself.

1179
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,610
Thanks.

1180
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:59,849
I'm so touched.

1181
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:01,279
You're a princess.

1182
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,119
- Call me a princess from now on. - My princess.

1183
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,219
Because I was a princess in my past life.

1184
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,560
That's right, my princess.

1185
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,829
- That's right, my princess. - That's right, my princess.

1186
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:13,359
The team these two lead...

1187
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,759
will attract all the teenagers.

1188
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,230
(The team that will attract all the teenagers)

1189
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:21,040
- Come, teenagers! - They might team up right away.

1190
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:22,840
Then, you're a friend of the princess.

1191
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:25,169
- I'm a friend of the princess. - They might meet up.

1192
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:27,309
(Is no: ze joining the princess?)

1193
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:28,939
Who was she in her past life?

1194
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,410
There is only one princess.

1195
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,879
There is only one princess.

1196
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,880
- I see. - Only one.

1197
00:48:33,881 --> 00:48:35,149
That's me. Is that me?

1198
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:37,249
(The one and only princess)

1199
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:38,520
She is...

1200
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:40,689
- strong... - That's true.

1201
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:42,489
- and calm. - That's so true.

1202
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:44,590
- She's calm. - That's so true.

1203
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:45,930
That's true.

1204
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,459
The lady in the center always hits the jackpot in her life.

1205
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,469
(The one who hits the jackpot)

1206
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:51,929
(The one is...)

1207
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:54,569
(Aiki.)

1208
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:57,109
- Aiki. - This is crazy.

1209
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:58,309
I'm jealous of her the most.

1210
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,940
She's the lucky charm. She's got all the luck.

1211
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,949
- You're a real lucky charm. - Yes.

1212
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:05,009
- That's true. - Really.

1213
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:06,010
(Am I...)

1214
00:49:06,011 --> 00:49:07,879
(the lucky charm?)

1215
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,050
You make everyone live well.

1216
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:11,449
You make everyone around you live well.

1217
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:12,819
Oh, my gosh.

1218
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,289
- From now on... - Thanks.

1219
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:15,419
Let's stick together.

1220
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,830
- Together. - So,

1221
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:19,800
all the luck goes to you to make people live well.

1222
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:22,259
- To share it. - So, she can share it with others.

1223
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,899
It's easier for you to act than think.

1224
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,069
- You're right. - When you debate...

1225
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:27,199
whether to do it or not,

1226
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,500
- you just do it. - That's right.

1227
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:32,010
Exactly. When something comes up, you just do it.

1228
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,310
Look at her. She's on her knees and holding her hands together.

1229
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,050
Was I a princess in my past life, by any chance?

1230
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,249
(Another person who wants to join the princess)

1231
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:43,119
(Hoping)

1232
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,120
You were a little kid.

1233
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,859
(The little kid's dream is broken.)

1234
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,589
I guess you have no choice.

1235
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:51,830
Kid, I'm the princess.

1236
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:54,559
You'll receive countless awards.

1237
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,370
- Me? - You'll be showered with awards.

1238
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:58,169
She's lucky when it comes to awards.

1239
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,939
- Always. - She always does.

1240
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:00,940
She always gets awards.

1241
00:50:00,941 --> 00:50:02,369
You can tell even from her face.

1242
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:04,710
You like to rank in first place, don't you?

1243
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:06,910
Yes.

1244
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,410
- Why are you serious? - Who doesn't like it?

1245
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:13,579
When it comes to competition,

1246
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,649
you're really competitive.

1247
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:17,549
I see.

1248
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,619
So, because that's who you are,

1249
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,120
it gives you a hard time.

1250
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:23,329
- I give myself a tough time. - She's also on her knees.

1251
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:25,389
It's not that you give others a hard time.

1252
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:27,030
It makes it tough for you.

1253
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:28,460
It's so hard for me.

1254
00:50:28,461 --> 00:50:29,799
It makes it tough for you.

1255
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:30,800
I mean it.

1256
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:33,139
- She's hilarious. - It makes it tough for me.

1257
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:35,269
- Goodness. - I mean it.

1258
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:37,139
What should I do?

1259
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,470
Why do you ask her?

1260
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,179
When you play rock, paper, scissors while looking in the mirror,

1261
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:42,239
who will win?

1262
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,409
- I'll win. - What?

1263
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:44,410
- No. - You're wrong.

1264
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:45,749
- I'll win. - What?

1265
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,119
- No, it'll tie. - You're wrong.

1266
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,349
I'll never win.

1267
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:49,520
She's really competitive.

1268
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,919
- Unbelievable. - How competitive.

1269
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,259
She's so competitive.

1270
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,929
She has to win no matter what.

1271
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:58,689
Then, you have to keep competing.

1272
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:01,230
She might play rock, paper, scissors all day while looking in the mirror.

1273
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:04,269
Who was she in her past life?

1274
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:05,770
Who was I in my past life?

1275
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,340
You seem to have used bows.

1276
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:08,970
(Good match for her)

1277
00:51:08,971 --> 00:51:10,569
- It suits her. - Cool.

1278
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:12,270
- It suits her. - She was a Hwarang.

1279
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,280
- That's also competitive. - I see.

1280
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:18,649
Her temperament remains as it was.

1281
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:20,250
The Hwarang wears a band like this.

1282
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,520
Riding a horse.

1283
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,319
- Look at her. - Incredible.

1284
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,320
I feel like I've seen her in an ancient mural.

1285
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:28,219
She's swinging her waist side to side while riding a horse.

1286
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:29,690
In an ancient mural.

1287
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:31,759
- From the Bakjae or Silla era. - I was riding a horse.

1288
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,200
Then, who was Gabee in her past life?

1289
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,029
(Gabee's past life)

1290
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:37,499
- Gabee. - She was a general.

1291
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,169
(A general)

1292
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:40,599
General!

1293
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:41,699
Conquer!

1294
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:42,700
(Laughing)

1295
00:51:42,701 --> 00:51:43,809
You might've married a princess.

1296
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:44,839
Will you marry me?

1297
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:45,840
Okay. Let's get married.

1298
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,139
Let's get married.

1299
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,840
I'm getting married to the princess!

1300
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:54,149
You should be careful of what you say to each other.

1301
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:55,549
- To each other? - You might hurt one another.

1302
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:56,689
- What? - Really?

1303
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:58,049
- I don't. - Me neither.

1304
00:51:58,050 --> 00:51:59,860
Stay away from each other when you're getting sensitive.

1305
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:01,619
(Sad)

1306
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,059
The princess could get sensitive,

1307
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,859
but it wouldn't look good if the general did.

1308
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,089
You know what I mean.

1309
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:08,059
- He would look narrow-minded. - Yes.

1310
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,730
It wouldn't be good if the general got sensitive.

1311
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,999
If you're worried about hurting each other, speak in English.

1312
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
That's a good idea.

1313
00:52:13,001 --> 00:52:15,740
We're not able to have a long conversation in English.

1314
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,969
"Oh, my gosh. I love you." Besides those,

1315
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:19,739
we're not able to say more in English.

1316
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:20,879
Okay. I love you too.

1317
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,910
We haven't learned many negative phrases.

1318
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:25,650
We've only learned happy phrases.

1319
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:28,319
She should get the award for best friendship.

1320
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,519
- The award for best friendship. - Best friendship.

1321
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,849
She should get the award for best friendship.

1322
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:33,420
- We'll give you the award. - The award for best friendship.

1323
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:35,689
Gabee will get the award for best friendship.

1324
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:37,459
We love you

1325
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:40,359
(We love you)

1326
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,599
Why are we doing this all of a sudden?

1327
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:45,070
(Personal fortune-telling is over with Gabee's friendship award.)

1328
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,369
Whether it's a health issue...

1329
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:50,069
or facing a strong opponent,

1330
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:52,910
what would be the worst hardship for our team?

1331
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:55,509
You will face hardship in the second phase.

1332
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:56,580
The second mission.

1333
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,080
You get hit by reality.

1334
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:00,349
We break up in the second mission.

1335
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:01,679
The second one is the most challenging.

1336
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,349
The third one will also be hard.

1337
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:04,820
The rest will be easy.

1338
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:07,189
Those two missions are the most challenging ones, actually.

1339
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:08,190
Yes.

1340
00:53:08,191 --> 00:53:09,789
- That's so true. - Right.

1341
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:10,790
Until it's over...

1342
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:12,690
I really want to stop doing it.

1343
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:16,159
- It's really tough. - I really wanted to give up.

1344
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,829
I really wanted to go home.

1345
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:19,599
We were doing it for three weeks.

1346
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,599
How far can we move up?

1347
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,740
Do you have a chance to win?

1348
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,340
Which countries are competing?

1349
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:25,769
- Is that all? - Yes.

1350
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:27,210
There are six teams.

1351
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,509
Who will win among them?

1352
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:31,309
- I'm nervous. - It's fun.

1353
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:33,449
- Oh, my gosh. I don't know. - I'm scared.

1354
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:37,389
(Everyone is on their knees.)

1355
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:41,420
(What will happen to BUMSUP's future?)

1356
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,589
You will compete against Japan many times.

1357
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:46,289
- That makes sense. - Since there are two teams.

1358
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:47,299
Right.

1359
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,799
- I kind of felt it. - I can see...

1360
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,130
that you continue to compete against Japan.

1361
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,069
You have to work hard, though. They won't be easy.

1362
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:55,499
We know they're not easy.

1363
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,070
- It'll be really tough. - We know that.

1364
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:01,339
You'll be better as you go into the latter part.

1365
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:05,009
But you keep getting into trouble during the first half.

1366
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:07,550
You face things that are different from what you think.

1367
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,090
You face things that are harder than you expected.

1368
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:12,089
In the worst case,

1369
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:13,989
you'll get hit by reality on the second mission...

1370
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:15,560
and be shaken up badly.

1371
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:20,330
Japanese teams really grit their teeth.

1372
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:24,029
Between Tokyo and Osaka,

1373
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:25,600
who grit their teeth more?

1374
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:26,870
Tokyo.

1375
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:27,870
(Going hard)

1376
00:54:27,871 --> 00:54:29,239
- Rie Hata. - It's fine.

1377
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,309
- We grit our teeth as well. - Of course.

1378
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,339
- We grit our teeth so hard. - You didn't grit your teeth...

1379
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:34,440
as much as the Japanese team.

1380
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,449
What? Grit your teeth harder.

1381
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:39,579
- Grit your teeth harder. - Right.

1382
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:40,949
- We have to practice. - We need to grit our teeth harder.

1383
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:44,649
The Tokyo team is practicing hard, just like K-pop idols.

1384
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:47,689
- Oh, my gosh. - Oh, my gosh.

1385
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:49,019
Does she know about the crew?

1386
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:52,259
The Osaka team is a bit casual.

1387
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,200
I guess it's the differences between the leaders.

1388
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:57,199
Depending on the leader, the team's mood is defined.

1389
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,429
(Depending on the leader, the crew's mood is different.)

1390
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:02,439
We actually brought some photos.

1391
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,440
Okay.

1392
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:07,510
(Finding out the crew leaders' energies briefly)

1393
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:10,650
Please take a look.

1394
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,379
(The first one is...)

1395
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,919
This woman named Kaea...

1396
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,220
sees through others.

1397
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:19,790
You can't beat her with a strategy.

1398
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,460
How can we win, then?

1399
00:55:21,461 --> 00:55:23,960
- Challenge them with our gut. - Exactly.

1400
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:25,830
You can't tell what's on her mind.

1401
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:29,059
- We won't know her thoughts. - That'll be scary.

1402
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:30,399
She doesn't show it.

1403
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,830
Even if she smiles, that's not a real smile.

1404
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,770
That's hard.

1405
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:35,739
- Rie Hata? - Yes.

1406
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:38,039
This is not in a bad way, but she has a streak of madness.

1407
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,740
(Streak of madness)

1408
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,339
She's a strategist.

1409
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,310
She can switch quickly.

1410
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:46,010
Her opinions are voiced out.

1411
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:48,880
The Americans definitely seem to be good.

1412
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:51,650
She has strong basic skills.

1413
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:53,150
- The woman who is named Marlee. - I see.

1414
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:58,359
- She has strong foundations. - She has strong basic skills.

1415
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,199
She started from where no one acknowledged her.

1416
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,570
- She started from the underground. - She shed a lot of tears.

1417
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:06,969
She even has her own teaching studio.

1418
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:08,269
(Building her inner strength from an early age)

1419
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:09,670
She's still young.

1420
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:11,439
She hasn't mentioned Ibuki.

1421
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,310
Ibuki is quite strong.

1422
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,279
So, she is...

1423
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,880
- popular, isn't she? - I see.

1424
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:17,950
- Ibuki? - Yes.

1425
00:56:17,951 --> 00:56:19,949
Isn't she popular in general?

1426
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:21,780
- Yes, she is. - Doesn't she always draw attention?

1427
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:25,350
- Isn't she like a walking headline? - I see.

1428
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,320
Who is the strongest?

1429
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:28,860
The strongest one.

1430
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:31,129
In terms of experience, Marlee tops all.

1431
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:32,729
(The 1st place in experience)

1432
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:35,299
For a strong person, Kaea is the strongest.

1433
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:36,499
(The 1st place as a strong person)

1434
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,399
Neither of them is easy to defeat.

1435
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,470
(Listening carefully)

1436
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:43,869
Then, will Street Woman Fighter Season 3...

1437
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:45,109
be more successful than Season 1?

1438
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,139
(Will World of Street Woman Fighter be successful?)

1439
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,880
From what I see...

1440
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,110
The production team is really paying attention now.

1441
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,979
- It matters. - She's shaking it.

1442
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,980
- She's shaking it. - Everyone, pay attention!

1443
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:56,479
Pay attention!

1444
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,089
(Everyone gets excited.)

1445
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:00,519
Let's hope together.

1446
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,520
Yes!

1447
00:57:01,521 --> 00:57:03,889
- Let's be honest. - Really honest?

1448
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:05,059
Please come here.

1449
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,559
(Come on)

1450
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,759
Honey J!

1451
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,829
(The show's fate is on Honey J's hands.)

1452
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:11,029
- Honey J! - Pick the white and the red.

1453
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:12,470
- The white and the red. - Don't think.

1454
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,370
- Just do it. - Do it as you feel.

1455
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,839
Yellow?

1456
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,909
(The first flag she chose is the yellow one.)

1457
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:18,910
(The second one to choose is white.)

1458
00:57:18,911 --> 00:57:20,309
- Okay. - Okay.

1459
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:21,710
- That's good. - One more.

1460
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,179
It's good.

1461
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:24,449
(Last flag)

1462
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:25,809
(The red one)

1463
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:27,579
Let's go!

1464
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:28,649
(Admiring)

1465
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:31,820
Where are we going?

1466
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,920
To get better ratings.

1467
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,929
(It's awesome.)

1468
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:41,800
It won't be so great at first, but it'll hit in the end.

1469
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:43,600
In the end.

1470
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,970
That's actually the perfect narrative.

1471
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,599
- That's right. - Yes, we start from the bottom...

1472
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,439
- and go up. - That's right.

1473
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,739
You all grit your teeth...

1474
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:52,970
when someone steps on you.

1475
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:55,639
- I see. - When you hurt your pride,

1476
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,350
you will get fierce.

1477
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:59,609
You can rarely have this opportunity.

1478
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:00,719
You're right.

1479
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,219
It won't be easy for all the leaders...

1480
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:04,619
to come together.

1481
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:06,449
As you all become busier...

1482
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:09,089
in various fields, it'll be difficult.

1483
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:10,559
(Nodding)

1484
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,030
So, enjoy it.

1485
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:16,029
- Thanks. - Let's hold hands.

1486
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:18,669
- Let's hold hands together. - Thank you.

1487
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:19,869
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

1488
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:22,069
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1489
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:25,710
(Let's go together!)

1490
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:27,540
Come on, guys.

1491
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,379
Let's go.

1492
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,410
Follow the leader.

1493
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:33,279
Okay, we have...

1494
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,579
We've got a free day.

1495
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:37,750
So, we're going to be shopping for some K-food.

1496
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:40,190
We got the list.

1497
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:41,690
We got the list right here.

1498
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:44,459
Okay. So, we're going to make some...

1499
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:46,899
kimbap and tteokbokki today.

1500
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,400
So, we need to go find the goods.

1501
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,329
- Finding the goods. - Get the goods.

1502
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:53,669
We're on our way to find the goods. Okay, let's go.

1503
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:55,499
- Acquire the goods! - Let's get the goods.

1504
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,600
It's good.

1505
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:58,669
(The food waiting for MOTIV at Tongin Traditional Market)

1506
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:00,409
(We're going to see it now!)

1507
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:01,739
(Already excited thinking about the delicious food)

1508
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:04,050
(Laughing)

1509
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:06,210
This is what we need. All right.

1510
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:10,120
Egg, sesame oil, carrot, sesame.

1511
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:11,219
(Starting shopping)

1512
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,449
What is this?

1513
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:13,920
(Surprised)

1514
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,589
Guys, these are so good right here.

1515
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:18,689
- Sesame. That's good. - Sesame.

1516
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:19,890
Sesame.

1517
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:21,030
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1518
00:59:21,031 --> 00:59:23,259
(Tasting it right away)

1519
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:24,669
Okay, ready? Let's try it.

1520
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:25,969
(Marlee is tasting it as well.)

1521
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:26,970
(Biting)

1522
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:28,500
That's yummy.

1523
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,000
It's really yummy.

1524
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:31,739
(Hold on!)

1525
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,039
(Old Korean coin?)

1526
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,939
(A special way to enjoy...)

1527
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:36,480
(Tongin Traditional Market)

1528
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,680
Guys, this is where we can get some coins.

1529
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,450
- Okay. - Yes. To get our goods.

1530
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:43,180
So, coin exchange.

1531
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:44,949
So, we can get our stuff.

1532
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:45,950
(Correct!)

1533
00:59:45,951 --> 00:59:48,289
We can just walk around and buy what we want...

1534
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:50,459
as long as they accept these coins.

1535
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:51,790
Thank you.

1536
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:54,829
(We exchanged coins and a tray to put food on.)

1537
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:56,900
It's those coins.

1538
00:59:56,970 --> 00:59:58,130
Oh, my gosh.

1539
00:59:58,270 --> 00:59:59,499
(Flashy)

1540
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:00,670
There is a hole.

1541
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:03,200
- There is a hole in the coin. - We're rich.

1542
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:04,440
I wish.

1543
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:06,010
Isn't it cute?

1544
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:07,840
It's kind of cute. No?

1545
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,139
Making good use of the coins.

1546
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:10,349
- You know what I'm saying. - Hey.

1547
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:11,350
(The coins match well with her earrings.)

1548
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:12,350
Hello.

1549
01:00:12,351 --> 01:00:13,450
(It's time to enjoy Tongin Traditional Market.)

1550
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,380
- Oh, yes. - Oh, yes.

1551
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,319
(What is Marlee looking at?)

1552
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,850
This looks good.

1553
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:20,490
I might get one of these.

1554
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:22,190
Hi.

1555
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,490
(This one)

1556
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,499
- How much is it? - Two coins.

1557
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,700
Okay.

1558
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,430
Thank you.

1559
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:33,329
(Eating it right away)

1560
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:34,369
(Blowing)

1561
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:37,170
(Biting after blowing to cool it down)

1562
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:38,710
This is good.

1563
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:42,010
I've had this one before. It's like a traditional...

1564
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:44,279
I don't remember what it's called, though.

1565
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,480
(Opening the mouth wide)

1566
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:47,879
My tray is empty. We have to fill it.

1567
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,179
- Empty tray. - Empty tray.

1568
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:50,489
- I don't have a tray. - Empty tray.

1569
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:53,149
- Do you have a tray? - No, just money.

1570
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,160
Just money.

1571
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:57,230
These slushes look fire. I can't even...

1572
01:00:57,490 --> 01:00:58,830
Mango slush?

1573
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:00,230
(Surprised)

1574
01:01:00,231 --> 01:01:01,500
- Four coins? - Four coins?

1575
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,260
Can we have a slush?

1576
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:05,230
- Mango? - Yes.

1577
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:07,500
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1578
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:09,139
(Screaming)

1579
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:10,170
You're too slow.

1580
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:12,240
I got my coins.

1581
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:14,279
(Filling it up)

1582
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,379
(Mango slush!)

1583
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:17,810
(Getting mango slush)

1584
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,750
- Thank you. - You have it ready?

1585
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:21,780
- One, two, three. - Wait.

1586
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:23,849
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1587
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:26,089
(Mango slush makes her smile.)

1588
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:27,290
I got your straw.

1589
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:28,820
Everything is four coins.

1590
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:31,390
Life should be like this. Just four coins.

1591
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:33,159
We've done what we needed to do.

1592
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,699
I think we've tried a good amount.

1593
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:36,800
I think it's time. Time to get our ingredients.

1594
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:40,400
It's time!

1595
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:42,770
Here we go.

1596
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,040
Let's get it.

1597
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:45,140
(Starting a mission to get ingredients)

1598
01:01:45,141 --> 01:01:46,809
- Come on. - Sesame oil.

1599
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:47,940
Sesame oil.

1600
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:51,380
- Sesame oil. - Yes, that's right.

1601
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:52,650
Sesame oil.

1602
01:01:52,651 --> 01:01:55,050
Here. Sesame oil. Acquired.

1603
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:56,680
How much is it?

1604
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,220
(Excited)

1605
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:01,960
First on my recipe list is down.

1606
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:03,590
- Do you have sesame seeds? - Yes.

1607
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,590
Thank you.

1608
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:08,529
The second thing is acquired. We've got the sesame oil.

1609
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:10,259
And we've got the sesame.

1610
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:11,299
Sesame seeds.

1611
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:12,799
(Sesame oil and sesame acquired)

1612
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,869
- Good sauce. - The sauce...

1613
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:17,310
- is secured. - Carrot. There's a carrot.

1614
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:18,769
- Girl. - That's huge.

1615
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:20,340
That carrot is too big.

1616
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:22,309
- One. - Okay.

1617
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:23,539
(Carrot acquired)

1618
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:24,680
Carrot acquired.

1619
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:28,450
(Fantaye is dancing with joy.)

1620
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:32,289

(Fantaye is excited.)

1622
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:36,219
Do you have eggs?

(Marlee is buying eggs.)

1624
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:39,390
All right. Eggs acquired.

1625
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:43,869
All right. We've got the four ingredients we needed here.

1626
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:45,430
So, let's go.

1627
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:46,969
- Let's go, my girl. - Let's go.

1628
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:49,039
- Let's go. - I'm so excited.

1629
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,239
(MOTIV bought all the ingredients they need.)

1630
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,310

1634
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:23,170
(Let's go cook now.)

1635
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:26,039
All right, you all. It's time to make some kimbap.

1636
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,609
Let's just do it like this.

1637
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:31,280
This is Group 1. Okay? This is Group 2. All right?

1638
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:32,749
Let's look at the video...

1639
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:34,679
just to double-check we're on the right path.

1640
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:35,820
We have to figure this out.

1641
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:38,020
We'll taste it later.

1642
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:40,050
- Sesame oil. It is just like... - Drizzle.

1643
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:42,520
Like that.

1644
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:45,689
(Drizzling sesame oil)

1645
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:46,790
Yes, like that.

(MOTIV kitchen is going smoothly.)

1647
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,170
How is it looking?

1648
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:53,829
- Do you like it? - I love it.

1649
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,300
Do you like it? I like it!

1650

Good. You're good.

1656
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,650
Right. You're going to make me nervous.

1657
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:08,679
- It's looking good, baby. - Back off.

1658
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:09,779
You ate that up.

1659
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:12,290
You should do that thing where you go like that.

1660
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:14,490
- Turn up. Yes. - Don't worry about it.

1661
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:18,689
(Yes!)

1662
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:20,759
Professional.

1663
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,360

What is that? Is that a vegetable?

1668
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,669
- I don't know. - That's pickled radish.

1669
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:31,670

Okay. We did it.

01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,259
(They made kimbap while singing.)

1702
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:29,430
What's your kimbap?

1703
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,270
Is this too much carrot?

1704
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:33,199
- What? No, that's good. - It's too much carrot.

1705
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,369
I... Yes! I did well.

It's beautiful, right?

1713

Okay. We got the pretty ones.

1720
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:05,400
For me, I think the winner goes to Logistx.

1721

- Yes. - Yes.

1722
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:09,969
It's avant-garde. It's exciting.

1723
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:12,240
- It makes you think. - It makes you feel something.

1724
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:14,639
- Yes. - It's provocative.

All right, guys. To pair with our dish,

1729
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:27,389
we need some tteokbokki.

1730

two toppings. All right?

gets to choose what toppings go on top...

1743

How are you feeling, Bella?

1750
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:14,840
I'm feeling great. Ready to grub.

1751
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:16,900

(Shooting a bullet of love)

1758
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:29,949

Oh, my gosh.

1763
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:38,730
(To Nyssa)

1764
01:07:38,731 --> 01:07:40,059
(A powerful kick from Bella)

1765
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:41,060
(Kick it!)

1766
01:07:41,061 --> 01:07:42,800
Five, four,

1767
01:07:43,130 --> 01:07:45,100
three, two.

1768
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:48,299
She can't even get it open. One.

1769
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:50,769
Ready? Fight!

1770
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:53,209

(Trying to gain the upper hand with those movements)

1773
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:57,410
(You there!)

1774
01:07:57,410 --> 01:07:58,410
(Go to sleep.)

1775
01:07:58,410 --> 01:07:59,410
(Me?)

1776
01:07:59,411 --> 01:08:00,779
A minor

1777
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:01,849
(How far are you going down?)

1778
01:08:01,850 --> 01:08:02,850
(Shaking the body)

1779
01:08:02,851 --> 01:08:06,220
(Shaking to the beat)

1780
01:08:06,350 --> 01:08:10,360
And five, four, three, two, one.

1781
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:12,189
(Nyssa's turn is done!)

1782
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:15,129
Nice. Give me a solid countdown.

1783
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:18,470
Three, two, one.

1784
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:22,039
Robbery.

(Screaming)

1786
01:08:23,041 --> 01:08:24,410
What's your pick, Bella?

1787
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:27,410
(Bella's pick is potato chips.)

1788
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:29,410
That's fine. These are mozzarella sticks, right?

1789
01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:30,610
Nice.

1790
01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:33,950
All right. Next round. We've got...

1791
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:38,990
We've got gummies. We've got eggs.

1792
01:08:39,090 --> 01:08:42,220
What is on their tteokbokki?

1793
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,490
Let's go, Abby...

1794
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:50,200
versus Fantaye.

1795
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,730
Ready? Fight!

1796
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:54,369
(Shocked)

1797
01:08:54,370 --> 01:08:55,440
(The song for the Middle Class Mission)

1798
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,170
(Moist eyes)

1799
01:08:57,540 --> 01:08:59,510
(Watch me.)

1800
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:02,409
(Laughing)

1801
01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:04,209
(Going to catch Fantaye)

1802
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:05,849
(Help me.)

1803
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:08,220
(The master of controlling)

1804
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:10,719
(Come on, Fantaye.)

1805
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:13,549
(Cheering)

1806
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:15,259
(Moving to the beat)

1807
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:16,759
(The magician who controls MOTIV.)

1808
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:17,760
(Boom)

1809
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:19,560
(Boom)

1810
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:22,059
(Fantaye, come forward.)

1811
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:23,159
(I don't want to.)

1812
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:26,030
Five, four, three, two.

1813
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:27,740
(Shooting)

1814
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:32,240
(Fantaye is starting right away.)

1815
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:33,940
(Starting from a sitting position)

1816
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:35,939
(Core strength that no one can beat)

1817
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:36,940
Where has she gone?

1818
01:09:36,941 --> 01:09:38,050
(I'm here.)

1819
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:39,150
(Fantaye, let's go!)

1820
01:09:39,151 --> 01:09:41,749
(Excited)

(Cheering)

1823
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:50,020
I'm done!

1824
01:09:50,021 --> 01:09:51,159
(Hilarious)

1825
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,330
I hated this.

1826
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:55,029
(The battle between Abby and Fantaye finished with a warm hug.)

1827
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:56,100
That was tough.

1828
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:58,370
- Five, four, - Four,

1829
01:09:58,670 --> 01:10:02,070
- three, two, one. - three, two, one.

1830
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,269
(Feeling the best)

1831
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:06,339
(Gummies for Fantaye)

1832
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:07,640
That's a nice little plate, though.

1833
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:10,339
The last and the final battle.

1834
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:12,810
Cheese and ice cream.

1835
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:16,579
Logistx versus Kaidi.

1836
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:17,590
Good luck.

1837
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:20,290
Who's going to be? Who's going first?

1838
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:23,059
- Ready? - Flip Flop.

1839
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:24,060
Fight!

1840
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:25,060
(Ready for Flip Flop)

1841
01:10:25,061 --> 01:10:27,260
(Oh, no)

1842
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:28,560
Why?

1843
01:10:28,561 --> 01:10:29,700
(Changing into dancing mode right away)

1844
01:10:31,530 --> 01:10:34,230
Make me a robot. Anyone.

1845
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:37,269
(Excited)

1846
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:39,869
(Here comes Robostx.)

1847
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:41,010
(Excited)

1848
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:42,340
Hey.

1849
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,780
It's the beanie over the eyes.

1850
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:47,379
(Falling into it)

1851
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:49,319
(Heartbeating dance)

1852
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,119
(Cheering)

1853
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,920
Are you going to do something on that floor?

1854
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,820
Okay.

1855
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:56,259
(This is me.)

1856
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:57,290
(Logistx)

1857
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:03,500
(World's top core strength)

1858
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:05,029
(Dancing together)

1859
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:07,800
Three, two, one!

1860
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:09,100
(Good job.)

1861
01:11:09,101 --> 01:11:11,170
- Good night. - Period.

1862
01:11:11,410 --> 01:11:13,340
(Next up is MOTIV's Kaidi)

1863
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,640
(Did you call me?)

1864
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:17,409
(Loving it)

1865
01:11:17,410 --> 01:11:19,150
(I am a good boy.)

1866
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:21,949
It's the real song.

1867
01:11:21,950 --> 01:11:23,750
(Watch me, Logistx.)

1868
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:26,020
(Cheering)

1869
01:11:34,030 --> 01:11:36,429
(You don't have to tell me what you want.)

1870
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:37,830
(I can take a hint.)

1871
01:11:37,930 --> 01:11:39,830
(Kicking, hoping to win)

1872
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:45,609
Thank you.

1873
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:46,610
I gave that my all.

1874
01:11:46,611 --> 01:11:48,340
That was my best performance on the whole show.

1875
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:51,810
- Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

1876
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:54,009
(Both won!)

1877
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:55,450
You guys both get to pick.

1878
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:58,649
Kaidi takes cheese. I'll take ice cream. Thanks.

1879
01:11:58,650 --> 01:12:00,150
(Running away)

1880
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:01,690
All right.

1881
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,390
I'm going to open it up.

1882
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:05,430
Mom, this is for you.

1883
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:07,860
And you put the flavor in.

1884
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:10,460
- You fill the water up to the line. - Yes.

1885
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,300
Then, you want to cook it for 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

1886
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,739
(Delicious cup tteokbokki is ready.)

1887
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:17,039
(Time to add the toppings acquired)

1888
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,269
(Crunchy)

1889
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:19,270
(Adding some more)

1890
01:12:19,271 --> 01:12:20,409
(Crunchy)

1891
01:12:20,410 --> 01:12:22,779
(Chef Bella's elegant hand gestures)

1892
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:24,909
All right. Our food is finally ready.

1893
01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:28,079
- Put your toppings in and enjoy! - Yes!

1894
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,450
(Let's enjoy!)

1895
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:33,389
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1896
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:34,590
Oh, my gosh. This is spicy.

1897
01:12:34,990 --> 01:12:35,990
(It's so good, you can't help but applaud.)

1898
01:12:35,990 --> 01:12:36,990
This is so yummy.

1899
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,560
It tastes like mac and cheese.

1900
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:39,929
(I picked the good one.)

1901
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:42,360
- It's delicious. - Yes, really.

1902
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:45,670
You love it?

1903
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:47,699
The chewiness is nice.

1904
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:48,870
The cheese one is pretty good.

1905
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,600
- Could I have this? - Yes.

1906
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:51,710
Don't play with me.

1907
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:54,810
(Dipping kimbap in tteokbokki)

1908
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,380
You know how to eat it.

1909
01:12:56,910 --> 01:12:58,449
That's how we eat it.

1910
01:12:58,450 --> 01:12:59,510
- Really? - Yes.

1911
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,450
I get it. It's good.

1912
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:03,850
Put it inside the sauce. It's fire.

1913
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:05,619
(That's how to eat.)

1914
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:06,750
Dip and dab.

1915
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:07,920
Roll from dip and dab.

1916
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:09,090
(Kimbap dipped in tteokbokki sauce)

1917
01:13:09,091 --> 01:13:10,490
(Eating it)

1918
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:11,789
(Abby is also trying it.)

1919
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:13,129
(Eating it)

1920
01:13:13,130 --> 01:13:16,260
Now that we've enjoyed our kimbap and tteokbokki,

1921
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:18,870
I feel like we are thoroughly nourished...

1922
01:13:19,070 --> 01:13:21,600
to get ready for these next missions.

1923
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:24,540
Let's go, you all!

1924
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,240
Let's go.

1925
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:32,250
Let's go.

1926
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:34,349
Bring it in.

1927
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:35,549
What's your MOTIV on three.

1928
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:37,019
- Three, two, one. - Get in.

1929
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:40,050
What's your MOTIV!

1930
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:46,089
(The sky has cleared for OSAKA Ojo Gang.)

1931
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:48,659
(Blooming cherry blossom)

1932
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:53,069
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's bus arrived somewhere.)

1933
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:55,740
You did a great job on the World of K-pop Mission.

1934
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,140
It was pretty tough.

1935
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:00,969
(OSAKA Ojo Gang finished the first team mission well.)

1936
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:03,280
We took the bus to get here.

1937
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:04,650
Do you know where we are?

1938
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:06,009
- I'm not sure. - I don't know.

1939
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:07,709
- I've never been here. - Is it your first time?

1940
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:08,749
Yes, it's my first time.

1941
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:12,150
This is where G-Dragon, the king of K-pop,

1942
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,520
came to shop.

1943
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:18,160
(Dongmyo, the center of shopping)

1944
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:22,800
(The mecca of vintage fashion, where G-Dragon loves.)

1945
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:25,429
(From undeniably unique items...)

1946
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:28,169
(to a store offering a wide range of items...)

1947
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:30,000
(and mouthwatering street food.)

1948
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,439
(This romantic place is...)

1949
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:35,040
(where new and old meet, Dongmyo.)

1950
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:36,979
Dongmyo is a place...

1951
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:41,419
where new fashion and old school fashion come together.

1952
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:43,280
- You can enjoy shopping. - It's cool.

1953
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:46,389
- Today, we take a break... - Yes.

1954
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:48,419
And look around Dongmyo Flea Market.

1955
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:50,259
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's tour in Dongmyo.)

1956
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:52,329
Let's go!

1957
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:53,660
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1958
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:59,269
(Feeling the vibe while walking)

1959
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:02,970
(Changing the direction when finding something cute)

1960
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:06,069
That toy looks like it's about to break apart.

1961
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:07,369
(Looking at something funny)

1962
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:09,579
- I'm hungry. - I'm hungry.

1963
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:10,839
Are you hungry?

1964
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,180
I'm hungry.

1965
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:14,780
- Hello. - Is it japchae?

1966
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,719
- Should I order two portions? - Ruu, is it japchae?

1967
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:17,890
- Yes. - Do you think that'll be enough?

1968
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:21,020
Hello. Two tteokbokki, please.

1969
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:22,860
- Two portions of tteokbokki? - Yes.

1970
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:26,029
And also japchae, please.

1971
01:15:26,030 --> 01:15:27,459
- Is one portion good? - Yes.

1972
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:28,799
One japchae, please.

1973
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:32,000
(Waiting for the food while dancing)

1974
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:33,369
Thank you.

1975
01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:34,670
There's japchae.

1976
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:38,169
(Junna's cam is following japchae.)

1977
01:15:38,170 --> 01:15:39,240
It looks delicious.

1978
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,640
- Thank you. - Smell it.

1979
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:43,710
Three, four.

1980
01:15:43,711 --> 01:15:45,649
(The classic of street food)

1981
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:48,979
(We'll enjoy japchae and tteokbokki.)

1982
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:49,980
(They first try the japchae they've eagerly waited for.)

1983
01:15:49,981 --> 01:15:51,219
It's tasty.

1984
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:53,219
(They first try the japchae they've eagerly waited for.)

1985
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:55,059
It's our first time eating tteokbokki.

1986
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:56,060
(They're moved by the taste of the original tteokbokki.)

1987
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:57,060
My goodness.

1988
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:59,360
(Impressed)

1989
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:01,529
- It's tasty. - It's tasty.

1990
01:16:01,530 --> 01:16:03,060
- It's tasty. - It's tasty.

1991
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:06,999
(She's serious about sharing japchae.)

1992
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,339
(Food tastes better when it's shared.)

1993
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:09,570
Thank you for the food.

1994
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:13,939
We enjoyed the food.

1995
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:15,280
We enjoyed the food.

1996
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:17,509
It's really tasty.

1997
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:18,579
(They resume with the energy from their full bellies.)

1998
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:21,050
Today, we have a mission.

1999
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:23,449
G-Dragon picked this place...

2000
01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:25,149
as the haven of fashion,

2001
01:16:25,150 --> 01:16:27,889
so we'll have Coordinator Ibuki's fashion battle.

2002
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:30,319
Okay.

2003
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:34,159
Thus, I'll be the mannequin.

2004
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:36,230
I'll divide the crew into two teams.

2005
01:16:36,530 --> 01:16:38,029
(Team Cool)

2006
01:16:38,030 --> 01:16:40,600
(Team Cute)

2007
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:42,339
I'll be the judge...

2008
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:45,169
and decide which team has done better.

2009
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:46,439
(Excited)

2010
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:47,440
That's scary.

2011
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:50,510
How about Team Ojo and Team Gang?

2012
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:53,579
- What? - Team Ojo versus Team Gang.

2013
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:55,020
Aren't we ojos?

2014
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:58,620
Would it be okay to make that decision by yourself?

2015
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:01,520
(Coordinator Ibuki's fashion battle)

2016
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:08,230
(Both Team Ojo and Team Gang begin shopping.)

2017
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:13,399
(Team Gang heads to the store with the hip gangster vibe.)

2018
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:14,499
(Going through the outfits with seriousness)

2019
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:15,699
How about leopard print?

2020
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:16,970
(Going through the outfits with seriousness)

2021
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:18,370
This one is nice.

2022
01:17:19,470 --> 01:17:20,509
The size is nice.

2023
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:22,179
- The size... - The size.

2024
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:23,680
The size will be perfect for Ibuki.

2025
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,980
(The first candidate isn't bad.)

2026
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:30,619
Shall we choose something eccentric?

2027
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:32,520
Let's go with the Osaka vibe.

2028
01:17:32,650 --> 01:17:33,650
This one!

2029
01:17:33,651 --> 01:17:35,889
(They move to the wardrobe of the hip-hoppers.)

2030
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:37,960
(The items suit her taste with 100-percent accuracy.)

2031
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,160
This is great!

2032
01:17:39,490 --> 01:17:40,829
Isn't it a bit small?

2033
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:42,030
Isn't it small?

2034
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:43,399
Perhaps she can just put it on her shoulders.

2035
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,299
(There's the size issue.)

2036
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:47,199
Is Ibuki this small?

2037
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:48,370
She's really small.

2038
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,740
(The jacket searcher spots her favorite jacket.)

2039
01:17:50,770 --> 01:17:52,310
The black one.

2040
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,810
(Kyoka's pick)

2041
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:56,010
The skulls look hardcore.

2042
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:57,680
It's nice.

2043
01:17:58,310 --> 01:17:59,349
It's really nice.

2044
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:01,619
(The skull jacket becomes Team Gang's favorite.)

2045
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:02,620
Shall we buy it?

2046
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:04,420
Is it good?

2047
01:18:04,421 --> 01:18:08,420
(A quick payment)

2048
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:11,990
(We love it.)

2049
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:13,789
It's cute.

2050
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:15,129
I want to put it on her.

2051
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:16,300
(They find a nice hat in the very next store.)

2052
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:18,530
Let's go.

2053
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:20,269
It's cute.

2054
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:22,199
(It matches the skull jacket perfectly.)

2055
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,969
(Paying in a heartbeat)

2056
01:18:24,970 --> 01:18:26,069
Thanks so much.

2057
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:27,969
- Bye. - Thank you. Bye.

2058
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:29,639
Bye.

2059
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:31,110
(Meanwhile, Team Ojo is...)

2060
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:33,250
I want it.

2061
01:18:33,251 --> 01:18:34,649
(If there's a cute bag, it's mine.)

2062
01:18:34,650 --> 01:18:36,649
(If there's a cute skirt, it's mine.)

2063
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:38,389
(Team Ojo members continue shopping for themselves.)

2064
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:40,849
(Photos come before shopping.)

2065
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:43,089
(For Midoris)

2066
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:47,529
(Team Ojo finally begins shopping for the mission.)

2067
01:18:47,530 --> 01:18:48,530
(She spots a jacket as soon as she enters the store.)

2068
01:18:48,531 --> 01:18:50,360
The leopard print will look good on her.

2069
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:51,969
- Yes. It has a strong vibe. - Right.

2070
01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:55,599
I would choose this item from this store.

2071
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,269
(Hana tries it on for Ibuki.)

2072
01:18:57,270 --> 01:19:00,409
Hold on. This is fun.

2073
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:02,009
(They begin to have fun with shopping.)

2074
01:19:02,010 --> 01:19:03,010
(She likes the first jacket she tried on.)

2075
01:19:03,011 --> 01:19:06,210
- How much is it? - How much is it?

2076
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:08,549
- Five thousand. - Five thousand.

2077
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:09,779
So it's 50 dollars.

2078
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:11,350
He says it's 50 dollars.

2079
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:14,089
We want to see Ibuki...

2080
01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:16,760
as a hot girl.

2081
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:18,459
Sexy Ibuki.

2082
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:19,890
All right. Let's buy it.

2083
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:22,099
Five thousand.

2084
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:23,429
(They still think it's 50 dollars.)

2085
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:25,229
(They learn that it's 5 dollars.)

2086
01:19:25,230 --> 01:19:27,430
Really? Is it five dollars?

2087
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:29,739
- He's saying it's five dollars. - What?

2088
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:30,799
Really?

2089
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:31,840
(They can't believe the price.)

2090
01:19:32,170 --> 01:19:33,739
I could just buy it.

2091
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:34,740
It's cheap!

2092
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:38,149
I thought it was 50 dollars, but it was 5 dollars.

2093
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:40,549
I thought the price of 50 dollars was too expensive.

2094
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:42,779
(They ended up making a reasonable purchase.)

2095
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:44,479
Isn't the price of five dollars too cheap?

2096
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,619
(It was well-purchased.)

2097
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:49,460
(While the members are shopping, where is Ibuki, today's model?)

2098
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:51,320
At a place like this,

2099
01:19:52,090 --> 01:19:54,390
I might find a waacking outfit.

2100
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:57,459
(Dazzling and flashy)

2101
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:59,829
If I find it...

2102
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:01,470
(I found it!)

2103
01:20:01,570 --> 01:20:03,200
I found it!

2104
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:06,309
(She enters a store that gave her a good vibe from the outside.)

2105
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:07,410
It's cute.

2106
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:09,740
It's brown.

2107
01:20:09,741 --> 01:20:10,879
(She finds a cute fur jacket.)

2108
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,750
I think it'll be nice since it's cold.

2109
01:20:13,410 --> 01:20:15,579
(She puts it on right away.)

2110
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:16,949
(She seems to like it.)

2111
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:19,319
(According to a tip-off, G-Dragon chose the same item.)

2112
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:20,589
(The news is delivered.)

2113
01:20:20,590 --> 01:20:21,890
(Happy)

2114
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:24,660
I have the same jacket as G-Dragon.

2115
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:27,529
Shall we get two?

2116
01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:28,799
- That's a good idea. - That's a good idea.

2117
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,260
I like this store for some reason.

2118
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,369
How much is it?

2119
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:33,969
(There are many items they like in this store.)

2120
01:20:33,970 --> 01:20:36,639
Do you think we'll need a white tank top?

2121
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:37,700
What do you think?

2122
01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:40,310
I think the color will go well with the outfit.

2123
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:41,779
Is it too similar? Do you think it would be bad?

2124
01:20:41,780 --> 01:20:43,679
This is dangerous.

2125
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:46,979
(OSAKA Ojo Gang: This must be a popular store.)

2126
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:48,619
(Feeling pressed, they purchase the items quickly.)

2127
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:50,320
- Together? - Together.

2128
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:51,920
Together?

2129
01:20:51,921 --> 01:20:56,920
(They run away quickly to avoid Team Gang.)

2130
01:20:57,490 --> 01:20:59,230
This one is simple.

2131
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:01,530
Yes. It's shiny.

2132
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:05,729
(Putting together the items they like)

2133
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:06,900
Kyoka.

2134
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:09,300
Kyoka, give me the fishnet.

2135
01:21:09,570 --> 01:21:10,869
(Kyoka brings a fishnet tank top.)

2136
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:12,070
Inside.

2137
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:14,609
- Inside. - Layered.

2138
01:21:14,610 --> 01:21:17,209
- Layered. - Layered.

2139
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:18,549
(They feel ecstatic because they love the outfit.)

2140
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:19,849
Does it hide the spangles?

2141
01:21:19,850 --> 01:21:21,379
- But it's totally cute. - It's really nice.

2142
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:23,780
We don't need another hanger. Why would you put two together?

2143
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:27,020
- It's nice. - We'll buy these two items.

2144
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:28,989
- How much? - How much?

2145
01:21:28,990 --> 01:21:30,089
(The most nerve-wrecking moment)

2146
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:32,289
- Discount. - Please give us a discount.

2147
01:21:32,290 --> 01:21:34,159
(They ask for a discount before hearing the total.)

2148
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:35,529
(The total of 112 dollars is more expensive than they thought.)

2149
01:21:35,530 --> 01:21:37,230
Oh, my gosh. They're pretty expensive.

2150
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,870
We don't have money.

2151
01:21:38,930 --> 01:21:41,200
(Confident)

2152
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:42,300
Discount, please.

2153
01:21:42,301 --> 01:21:44,039
We already bought a jacket, you know?

2154
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,669
(Their 6 eyes are sparkling with desperation for a discount.)

2155
01:21:45,670 --> 01:21:50,480
(Checking the wallet)

2156
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:52,349
Can you do 90 dollars?

2157
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:54,909
- No. I'm sorry. - How about 95 dollars?

2158
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:56,279
- No. I'm sorry. - Okay.

2159
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,690
- All right. - Okay. One hundred dollars.

2160
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,149
(They're excited about the successful negotiation.)

2161
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:02,259
- Thanks so much. - Thank you.

2162
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:03,260
Thank you.

2163
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:05,060
For normal days,

2164
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:07,860
it would've been easier to match clothes.

2165
01:22:08,230 --> 01:22:09,600
But we gave it...

2166
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:12,469
a bit of the high fashion vibe.

2167
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:13,900
- That's right. - The innerwear.

2168
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:15,169
The way we matched the items...

2169
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:16,800
- The prop too. - That's right.

2170
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:18,369
We're confident.

2171
01:22:18,370 --> 01:22:19,809
They're here.

2172
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:21,270
The rivals are here.

2173
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:23,579
We're sorry.

2174
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:25,349
- We're a bit late. - We're a bit late.

2175
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:29,949
(The leader arrives at the right time.)

2176
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:32,519
I visited the store G-Dragon had been to.

2177
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,650
(Ibuki shows up in a G-Dragon jacket.)

2178
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,889
Did you buy it at the store G-Dragon visited?

2179
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:38,089
- It's cute. - It's cute.

2180
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:39,959
Did everyone enjoy shopping?

2181
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,589
(Their voices show their confidence.)

2182
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:42,729
- Did you find many good items? - Yes.

2183
01:22:42,730 --> 01:22:44,900
They're totally nice.

2184
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:46,399
It's scary when you guys are like that.

2185
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,300
- They're totally nice. - Okay.

2186
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,899
We did a pretty good job too.

2187
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:50,939
(We refuse to lose.)

2188
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:52,809
- Look forward to the outfit. - You'll like it.

2189
01:22:52,810 --> 01:22:54,109
- That's nice. - Right.

2190
01:22:54,110 --> 01:22:56,009
Let's wrap up the shopping now.

2191
01:22:56,010 --> 01:23:00,250
Now, there's a street that's famous as G-Dragon's shopping spot.

2192
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:01,950
Let's go there together,

2193
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:07,119
take photos, and dance to the crew song.

2194
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:10,960
(They set out to the G-Dragon street in Dongmyo!)

2195
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:52,669
(Let's enter the fashion battlefield.)

2196
01:23:52,670 --> 01:23:54,430
We had a nice shopping trip.

2197
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:56,399
(They sit down solemnly for the fashion battle.)

2198
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,439
Did you find anything?

2199
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:58,709
Yes, we did.

2200
01:23:58,710 --> 01:24:00,209
In a good sense?

2201
01:24:00,210 --> 01:24:01,509
(Their voices are full of confidence.)

2202
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:03,410
We bought really nice items, right?

2203
01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:06,749
OSAKA Ojo Gang hates losing.

2204
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,349
(She saw through them.)

2205
01:24:08,350 --> 01:24:10,849
So the fashion battle took long.

2206
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:12,189
I was like, "It's taking them long."

2207
01:24:12,190 --> 01:24:14,849
The production crew told me that the members were serious.

2208
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:16,120
(That was a long wait.)

2209
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:18,059
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2210
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:19,189
(The real battler wants to hurry up and have a battle.)

2211
01:24:19,190 --> 01:24:20,330
Minami, you do it.

2212
01:24:20,530 --> 01:24:21,729
(There's strange tension in the room.)

2213
01:24:21,730 --> 01:24:23,599
- Play or lose, - Play or lose,

2214
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,660
- rock, paper, scissors - rock, paper, scissors

2215
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:25,769
(Play or lose)

2216
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:26,770
(Rock, paper, scissors)

2217
01:24:26,771 --> 01:24:28,870
(The smile of the winning team)

2218
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:31,370
It doesn't matter whether you go 1st or 2nd.

2219
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:32,770
We'll go second.

2220
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:34,369
(They actually wanted to go second.)

2221
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:36,209
Will you be okay with that?

2222
01:24:36,210 --> 01:24:38,580
Okay. We'll go first.

2223
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:43,179
(Team Gang will be the first to dress up Ibuki.)

2224
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:44,750
It's okay. We'll definitely win.

2225
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,120
It's okay. We'll definitely win.

2226
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:49,259
Ibuki will like our outfit better.

2227
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:50,260
- Of course. - I can't be sure,

2228
01:24:50,261 --> 01:24:51,389
- but still. - I think the same.

2229
01:24:51,390 --> 01:24:53,129
- Don't say, "I can't be sure." - We haven't seen theirs yet.

2230
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:55,060
That's right. We can't be sure since we haven't seen theirs yet.

2231
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:57,530
But the glasses are the key point.

2232
01:24:57,930 --> 01:25:00,129
We'll be able to see Ibuki...

2233
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:01,499
as we've never seen her before.

2234
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,200
The key point is the new Ibuki.

2235
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:05,409
- Are you done? - You can't take a peek.

2236
01:25:05,410 --> 01:25:06,410
Do you need more time?

2237
01:25:06,740 --> 01:25:07,909
I'm sorry,

2238
01:25:07,910 --> 01:25:08,910
but our outfit is perfect.

2239
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:10,909
- What? - The size fits perfectly,

2240
01:25:10,910 --> 01:25:13,250
- better than we had expected. - No way.

2241
01:25:13,850 --> 01:25:15,650
I kept hearing laughter.

2242
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:17,819
The outfit was too cute.

2243
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:19,219
Did she laugh because the outfit was cute?

2244
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:20,220
It was so cute.

2245
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:23,419
- In three, two, one. - In three, two, one.

2246
01:25:23,420 --> 01:25:24,689
(Ta-da)

2247
01:25:24,690 --> 01:25:26,390
(The style that brings out a laughter of satisfaction)

2248
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,359
(A collaboration of a skull jacket that's the essence of hip-hop...)

2249
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,129
(and the trapper hat that brings the cuteness to the max)

2250
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:34,729
(The bermuda shorts add trendiness instead of a miniskirt.)

2251
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:36,539
(The cute sweet little Kitty bag adds a kick to the outfit.)

2252
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:38,199
(Then there's the beautiful face of the model.)

2253
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:39,209
(Team Gang's Skull Style is...)

2254
01:25:39,210 --> 01:25:40,340
(a hip-hop and gangster outfit with a spoonful of cuteness.)

2255
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:42,009
(The cute gangster appears.)

2256
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:43,609
- That is so cute! - That is so cute!

2257
01:25:43,610 --> 01:25:45,509
(Both Team Ojo and Team Gang smile because of her cuteness.)

2258
01:25:45,510 --> 01:25:46,979
(And everyone wants the kitten bag.)

2259
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:50,979
(We should've bought it first.)

2260
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:52,619
(Model Ibuki likes Team Gang's styling as well.)

2261
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:53,919
Nice.

2262
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:55,189
(They have a feeling that they will win.)

2263
01:25:55,190 --> 01:25:57,119
- It's cute. - It's cute.

2264
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,659
When I tried on the outfit by itself, I was like,

2265
01:25:58,660 --> 01:26:00,289
"Okay. This is the vibe of Kyoka, Minami, and Junna."

2266
01:26:00,290 --> 01:26:01,759
But as soon as I saw the kitten bag...

2267
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,900
(This is mine.)

2268
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:05,570
Show the back as well.

2269
01:26:06,330 --> 01:26:09,139
(There's a cute skull.)

2270
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:10,239
Nice.

2271
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:11,669
(Judge Ibuki is highly satisfied.)

2272
01:26:11,670 --> 01:26:13,669
Now comes Team Cute.

2273
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:16,710
- Okay. - Team Cute will be back.

2274
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:17,779
(Team Ojo leaves to get Ibuki dressed.)

2275
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:19,179
We're Team Cute.

2276
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:21,880
- "Team Cute." - Team Cute will be back.

2277
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:23,650
The outfit suits her so well.

2278
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,750
- It suits her so well. - Please do a runway show.

2279
01:26:27,450 --> 01:26:30,760
I think we may be scouted, Kyoka.

2280
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:33,060
- Stylist. - Stylist.

2281
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:34,829
Shall we become stylists?

2282
01:26:34,830 --> 01:26:36,830
We might get a styling job.

2283
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:39,599
(They wait with their backs turned.)

2284
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:40,830
What is it?

2285
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:43,100
- We nailed it. - Thank you.

2286
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:45,869
We nailed the assignment this time. We're sorry.

2287
01:26:45,870 --> 01:26:46,870
We're really sorry.

2288
01:26:46,871 --> 01:26:48,470
(Team Ojo's confident laughter brings up their expectations.)

2289
01:26:51,980 --> 01:26:53,149
(The top in the team color, a leopard print jacket, )

2290
01:26:53,150 --> 01:26:54,949
(and the tinted glasses that add kitschiness)

2291
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:56,349
She looks like a teacher.

2292
01:26:56,350 --> 01:26:57,350
(The smart image gives her a teacher's vibe.)

2293
01:26:57,351 --> 01:27:00,350
(Team Ojo's sexy teacher style has cuteness and sexiness.)

2294
01:27:00,450 --> 01:27:01,790
There are two looks.

2295
01:27:01,890 --> 01:27:03,519
This is the first look.

2296
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:04,589
The first one? Okay.

2297
01:27:04,590 --> 01:27:07,059
(This is the killer look.)

2298
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:09,600
(Team Gang: Not bad.)

2299
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:11,830
It's the team color.

2300
01:27:12,470 --> 01:27:14,930
(OSAKA Ojo Gang becomes one through the team color.)

2301
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,969
These three are giving us bad reactions.

2302
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:18,199
We won.

2303
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:19,309
(They're certain that they'll win.)

2304
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:21,769
- I'm sorry, but we won. - "I'm sorry, but we won."

2305
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:24,639
(They're certain about the result.)

2306
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:26,249
Ibuki's opinion is important.

2307
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:28,619
(Calm down.)

2308
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:29,620
(Let's do this.)

2309
01:27:29,621 --> 01:27:31,680
(They urge her to announce the result quickly.)

2310
01:27:31,850 --> 01:27:32,850
Oh, no!

2311
01:27:32,851 --> 01:27:35,319
(I'm so nervous.)

2312
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:36,419
I'm sorry,

2313
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:38,090
but this is more nerve-racking than tomorrow's shoot.

2314
01:27:38,690 --> 01:27:42,459
The first Ibuki's Fashion Battle for OSAKA Ojo Gang.

2315
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:45,999
(It's funny because they're being serious for no reason.)

2316
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,700
The shared mission was Dress Up Model Ibuki!

2317
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:52,270
Who will be the winner? Which team will win?

2318
01:27:52,370 --> 01:27:54,539
(The textbook example of cute and sexy, Team Ojo...)

2319
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:56,639
(versus the personification of coolness, Team Gang)

2320
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:59,979
(Tam Gang with Kyoka, Junna, and Minami wins.)

2321
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:02,219
(Disappointed)

2322
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:03,649
(Happy versus disappointed)

2323
01:28:03,650 --> 01:28:06,319
- OSAKA Ojo Gang! - OSAKA Ojo Gang!

2324
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:08,890
- I'll be exact. - "I'll be exact."

2325
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:10,719
I like Team Ojo's look better.

2326
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:13,459
It's more realistic.

2327
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:15,429
It's an outfit I can actually wear.

2328
01:28:15,430 --> 01:28:18,459
But the fashion Kyoka, Junna, and Minami prepared...

2329
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:21,369
felt fresh to me.

2330
01:28:21,370 --> 01:28:23,769
I liked the fact that it was a look I wasn't used to.

2331
01:28:23,770 --> 01:28:25,199
The fashion vibe...

2332
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,670
was completed with the kitten bag.

2333
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:30,379
(One bag determined the result.)

2334
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:33,379
(The kitten bag was a superb touch.)

2335
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:36,749
The balance was impressive.

2336
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:40,989
(Team Gang's work was high-quality fashion.)

2337
01:28:40,990 --> 01:28:43,389
(Proud)

2338
01:28:43,390 --> 01:28:46,389
(Team Ojo admits their win and congratulates them.)

2339
01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:48,260
Both outfits were really pretty.

2340
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:50,159
(Ibuki seems to remember something.)

2341
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:51,359
Is there a present?

2342
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,599
- What is it? - While you guys...

2343
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,400
bought these clothes,

2344
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:58,470
I bought your presents.

2345
01:28:58,670 --> 01:29:01,810
(Curious, happy, excited)

2346
01:29:01,910 --> 01:29:05,409
These items will upgrade OSAKA Ojo Gang's gangster vibe.

2347
01:29:05,410 --> 01:29:07,410
They're huge necklaces.

2348
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:13,050
(Ibuki's presents satisfy all OSAKA Ojo Gang members.)

2349
01:29:13,490 --> 01:29:16,689
I want to buy a variety of necklaces...

2350
01:29:16,690 --> 01:29:19,360
that has a gangster vibe.

2351
01:29:20,390 --> 01:29:21,490
Something like this one.

2352
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:23,230
Gang!

2353
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:25,430
Gang!

2354
01:29:26,230 --> 01:29:27,730
It's totally gangster.

2355
01:29:28,170 --> 01:29:30,370
These are scary necklaces.

2356
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:35,239
Everyone will be scared of us once we put on these necklaces.

2357
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:37,510
(Laughing)

2358
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:41,679
(They can't wait to pick a necklace.)

2359
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:43,119
This one is Ruu's.

2360
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,579
Ibuki, choose them for us.

2361
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:46,320
- Please do that. - For each and every one?

2362
01:29:47,290 --> 01:29:50,519
(They decide to pick what they want.)

2363
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:55,430
(Each choosing what they want)

2364
01:29:55,530 --> 01:29:56,929
Thank you, Ibuki.

2365
01:29:56,930 --> 01:29:59,199
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2366
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:00,470
Today,

2367
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:03,569
the fashion battle was fun and refreshing, right?

2368
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:06,410
- Yes. - It was relaxing and fun, right?

2369
01:30:07,210 --> 01:30:09,609
Let's continue with this vibe for the next mission.

2370
01:30:09,610 --> 01:30:11,810
Let's go. Let's keep up the OSAKA Ojo Gang vibe.

2371
01:30:12,010 --> 01:30:13,149
(They replenished...)

2372
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:14,509
(their energy and happiness.)

2373
01:30:14,510 --> 01:30:18,249
- Ojo Gang! - Ojo Gang!

2374
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:20,190
- Yes. - Yes.

2375
01:30:20,890 --> 01:30:23,959
(A healing time for the 5 surviving crews)

2376
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:26,090
(A high-tension pool party)

2377
01:30:26,190 --> 01:30:27,790
- What? - What's this?

2378
01:30:28,900 --> 01:30:30,900
(It's a pool party for the 5 surviving crews.)

2379
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,269
(Beach towels are a must when you play in the water!)

2380
01:30:32,270 --> 01:30:33,530
Let's go!

2381
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,439
(Let's enjoy the pool party.)

2382
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:39,610
When we went up the stairs, a party was waiting for us.

2383
01:30:43,510 --> 01:30:45,979
- Cheers! - Cheers!

2384
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:49,120
We were happy to win and participate in a pool party.

2385
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:50,280
It's tasty.

2386
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:52,079
(Tasty and special food will sate their hunger.)

2387
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,520
We're hungry.

2388
01:30:53,650 --> 01:30:55,289
(Sweet desserts and beer...)

2389
01:30:55,290 --> 01:30:57,190
(that will melt away the stress are ready!)

2390
01:30:58,090 --> 01:30:59,190
It's tasty.

2391
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:00,860
It's tasty.

2392
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:02,929
They're here!

2393
01:31:02,930 --> 01:31:05,000
You guys look cute.

2394
01:31:05,430 --> 01:31:06,900
(I'm excited.)

2395
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,699
Gabee!

2396
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:10,840
- Oh, my gosh. - Oh, my gosh.

2397
01:31:10,970 --> 01:31:12,640
Pool parties are always fun.

2398
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:17,210
Lip J.

2399
01:31:17,910 --> 01:31:19,750
(I'm excited.)

2400
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:21,880
(It's going to be so much fun.)

2401
01:31:21,980 --> 01:31:23,350
Oh, my gosh.

2402
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,889
Marlee!

2403
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:27,989
(This is the American groove.)

2404
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:30,360
Pool party. It was nice.

2405
01:31:33,490 --> 01:31:36,730
I'm confident in myself no matter what I'm wearing.

2406
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:39,230
(This is exciting.)

2407
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:40,600
That's a...

2408
01:31:40,601 --> 01:31:42,200
- Look at this. It's huge. - Yes, it's the bottle.

2409
01:31:42,270 --> 01:31:44,240
This whole setting is making me want to drink.

2410
01:31:44,670 --> 01:31:45,670
(Laughing)

2411
01:31:45,671 --> 01:31:49,580
Oh, my gosh! Look at that skirt! I love it.

2412
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:51,380
(It suits their tastes.)

2413
01:31:51,910 --> 01:31:52,980
How cute!

2414
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:56,049
(Petite)

2415
01:31:56,050 --> 01:31:59,120
It was the most amount of fun I had on World of Street Woman Fighter.

2416
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:01,920
(It's good to see everyone.)

2417
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:03,860
How pretty. How cute.

2418
01:32:06,990 --> 01:32:08,930
- So cute. - You go.

2419
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:12,499
- Oh, my gosh. - They look so pretty. Goodness.

2420
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:13,930
(Hello.)

2421
01:32:14,970 --> 01:32:15,970
(Give OSAKA Ojo Gang a lot of attention.)

2422
01:32:15,971 --> 01:32:17,969
- Jennie... - It pairs with no bag.

2423
01:32:17,970 --> 01:32:19,810
- They're here! - No bags.

2424
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:24,410
How pretty.

2425
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:31,420
(AG SQUAD is excited.)

2426
01:32:32,950 --> 01:32:34,289
It felt like we finally did it.

2427
01:32:34,290 --> 01:32:36,189
- It's time. - Let's go!

2428
01:32:36,190 --> 01:32:37,190
Let's go.

2429
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:39,529
(The energy runs high.)

2430
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:41,560
AG SQUAD.

2431
01:32:42,190 --> 01:32:43,559
(Let's...)

2432
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:45,230
(party.)

2433
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:46,600
(Dancing)

2434
01:32:46,601 --> 01:32:48,370
This is so cute.

2435
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:52,069
A toast to AG SQUAD!

2436
01:32:52,070 --> 01:32:54,070
(A toast to AG SQUAD!)

2437
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:57,779
Coming first? That was what we wanted to do.

2438
01:32:57,780 --> 01:33:00,609
We really felt like we got treated like queens.

2439
01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:01,850
I'm so happy.

2440
01:33:02,010 --> 01:33:03,020
Let's dig in.

2441
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:04,880
(This is the taste.)

2442
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:06,350
Oh, my gosh. Shrimp.

2443
01:33:07,190 --> 01:33:08,290
(The taste of victory)

2444
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:10,859
- It's tasty. - It was such beautiful food,

2445
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:12,159
like shrimps...

2446
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:16,000
There were good croissants and fruits.

2447
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:17,760
Period!

2448
01:33:17,761 --> 01:33:19,699
It was just such a good spread.

2449
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:22,740
- Cheers. - Cheers.

2450
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:24,340
They resemble each other.

2451
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,210
- I didn't know that. - It must be nice to be the winner.

2452
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:29,940
Hey, you guys. We're all winners here.

2453
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:32,709
It was nice. It was nice not to have to worry,

2454
01:33:32,710 --> 01:33:34,980
getting to just relax and enjoy, finally.

2455
01:33:35,650 --> 01:33:36,780
(Screaming)

2456
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:40,650
(Splashing)

2457
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:43,690
(They enjoy the pool party in earnest.)

2458
01:33:44,190 --> 01:33:45,190
(Come here!)

2459
01:33:47,690 --> 01:33:49,159
(Someone save Uwa.)

2460
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:51,130
(Laughing)

2461
01:33:51,730 --> 01:33:54,700
For the first time in a while, we had fun without a worry.

2462
01:33:57,640 --> 01:33:59,109
(Having...)

2463
01:33:59,110 --> 01:34:00,810
(the best time)

2464
01:34:01,340 --> 01:34:03,080
(Swimming)

2465
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:07,280
(What's that?)

2466
01:34:09,850 --> 01:34:12,180
(The sky opens.)

2467
01:34:12,890 --> 01:34:14,190
(I love it.)

2468
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:16,160
(It's dance time.)

2469
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:18,220
(Absorbed)

2470
01:34:20,090 --> 01:34:21,789
(After a powerful move, )

2471
01:34:21,790 --> 01:34:22,959
(she dives into the pool.)

2472
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,830
(You're the ending fairy of today.)

2473
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:28,400
We've been enemies until now.

2474
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:33,409
Having to think about how we can beat each other...

2475
01:34:33,410 --> 01:34:34,570
in these missions...

2476
01:34:34,910 --> 01:34:36,139
(Perfect teamwork)

2477
01:34:36,140 --> 01:34:38,980
We weren't stressed out about the missions for the first time.

2478
01:34:39,380 --> 01:34:43,850
I was so happy for a chance to hang out with everyone.

2479
01:34:44,550 --> 01:34:45,720
(Saving memories)

2480
01:34:46,650 --> 01:34:47,719
Wasn't it so much fun?

2481
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:49,590
- It was fun. - It was fun.

2482
01:34:51,890 --> 01:34:53,389
That's the TV mode.

2483
01:34:53,390 --> 01:34:54,390
Hello.

2484
01:34:54,391 --> 01:34:55,759
(Screaming)

2485
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:56,760
(No way)

2486
01:34:56,761 --> 01:34:58,960
(Is this for real?)

2487
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:04,669
That's the TV mode.

2488
01:35:04,670 --> 01:35:05,670
Hello.

2489
01:35:05,671 --> 01:35:07,109
(Screaming)

2490
01:35:07,110 --> 01:35:09,710
Hello, World of Street Woman Fighter dancers.

2491
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:12,139
(No way)

2492
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:13,449
(Is this...)

2493
01:35:13,450 --> 01:35:15,450
(for real?)

2494
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:18,119
(Whose voice surprised the 5 crews?)

2495
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:20,689
Hello, World of Street Woman Fighter dancers.

2496
01:35:20,690 --> 01:35:22,089
It's Jennie here.

2497
01:35:22,090 --> 01:35:23,090
Jennie.

2498
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,120
- No way! - Is that Jennie?

2499
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:28,360
- Jennie! - That was Jennie.

2500
01:35:28,460 --> 01:35:29,499
What?

2501
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:30,899
It's Jennie here.

2502
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:32,359
("In the US, Jennie's 'Ruby' Becomes the Best Album of the Year")

2503
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:35,000
(The master of performance with a strong command of the stage)

2504
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:37,669
(The trendsetter who represents the Gen Zers, Jennie)

2505
01:35:37,670 --> 01:35:39,869
(We can't believe we're seeing Jennie.)

2506
01:35:39,870 --> 01:35:42,709
Oh, my gosh. She's going to tell us the next mission.

2507
01:35:42,710 --> 01:35:44,379
Jennie showed up on the screen.

2508
01:35:44,380 --> 01:35:46,110
I was so happy.

2509
01:35:46,210 --> 01:35:48,349
And I've got a special mission for you,

2510
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:51,719
the iconic Mega Crew Mission.

2511
01:35:51,720 --> 01:35:53,490
(Mega Crew Mission)

2512
01:35:53,690 --> 01:35:56,120
It's the Mega Crew Mission as we expected!

2513
01:35:56,220 --> 01:35:57,890
Mega Crew Mission!

2514
01:35:58,790 --> 01:36:00,529
Nice! I like it.

2515
01:36:00,530 --> 01:36:02,860
(Mega Crew Mission)

2516
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:05,759
(With a large group of dancers, )

2517
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,830
(they'll make one awe-inspiring performance.)

2518
01:36:09,170 --> 01:36:10,799
(The signature mission of the original dance series, )

2519
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:11,870
(the Mega Crew Mission)

2520
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:13,340
(Expectant)

2521
01:36:13,341 --> 01:36:15,069
I was so happy.

2522
01:36:15,070 --> 01:36:19,209
I'm certain that we can make a really cool performance...

2523
01:36:19,210 --> 01:36:20,579
for the Mega Crew Mission.

2524
01:36:20,580 --> 01:36:22,620
There isn't a single reason why...

2525
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:25,180
we'll get eliminated in this mission.

2526
01:36:26,220 --> 01:36:27,220
It's the Mega Crew.

2527
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:29,789
I'm excited. This mission is for us.

2528
01:36:29,790 --> 01:36:32,260
We're ready to show you MOTIV crew.

2529
01:36:33,430 --> 01:36:34,760
USA!

2530
01:36:35,290 --> 01:36:36,599
Finally, we'll have the Mega Crew Mission...

2531
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:37,600
with all the members.

2532
01:36:37,601 --> 01:36:39,969
From the beginning, OSAKA Ojo Gang...

2533
01:36:39,970 --> 01:36:42,499
has really wanted to show our power through this mission.

2534
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:44,900
Honey J's crew placed first in the Mega Crew Mission.

2535
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:46,239
We're confident.

2536
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:47,310
We're ready to crush all the other crews.

2537
01:36:47,410 --> 01:36:48,940
Mega crew? This is our thing.

2538
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:51,810
I specialize in mega crew.

2539
01:36:52,110 --> 01:36:53,580
So does Kyra.

2540
01:36:54,380 --> 01:36:58,019
I would say she and I are a massive threat to everybody.

2541
01:36:58,020 --> 01:37:00,890
I'm very confident to win this mission, the Mega Crew.

2542
01:37:01,050 --> 01:37:03,460
But this time, it's on another level.

2543
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:06,129
You'll head back to your home countries...

2544
01:37:06,130 --> 01:37:10,600
and create a performance that shows the true identity of your nation.

2545
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:13,030
- Oh, my. - You do it in your home country.

2546
01:37:13,230 --> 01:37:15,029
- Really? - Identity.

2547
01:37:15,030 --> 01:37:16,039
It's on another level.

2548
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:17,139
This is the best.

2549
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:19,340
We have to represent our country.

2550
01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:20,540
This is amazing.

2551
01:37:20,570 --> 01:37:22,469
This isn't just about dancing.

2552
01:37:22,470 --> 01:37:25,580
It's about telling your country's story through your moves.

2553
01:37:26,410 --> 01:37:28,679
Your country's story through your moves.

2554
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:29,950
We're going to give you a lesson.

2555
01:37:30,580 --> 01:37:32,649
The story of your own country.

2556
01:37:32,650 --> 01:37:36,959
Osaka doesn't have many symbolic things, does it?

2557
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:37,960
Takoyaki?

2558
01:37:39,330 --> 01:37:41,390
Let's kick off the Mega Crew Mission.

2559
01:37:41,490 --> 01:37:44,060
Ready? Fight!

2560
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:45,160
Fight!

2561
01:37:45,161 --> 01:37:46,170
(We're ready.)

2562
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:47,970
(Let's do this.)

2563
01:37:48,530 --> 01:37:50,940
We'll grit our teeth and give a proper performance.

2564
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:54,540
Mega Crew Mission is the mission for MOTIV crew.

2565
01:37:55,610 --> 01:37:58,139
So that's how it's going to be.

2566
01:37:58,140 --> 01:37:59,649
When I was the special judge for the Mega Crew Mission,

2567
01:37:59,650 --> 01:38:03,049
there was only one instruction. "This is the next mission."

2568
01:38:03,050 --> 01:38:07,189
There was a limit to what I could imagine.

2569
01:38:07,190 --> 01:38:09,920
Now that I'm a participant,

2570
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:12,220
the weight is totally different.

2571
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:13,789
(World of Street Woman Fighter's Mega Crew Mission rules)

2572
01:38:13,790 --> 01:38:14,829
(Are there rules?)

2573
01:38:14,830 --> 01:38:16,030
Mega Crew Mission rules.

2574
01:38:16,330 --> 01:38:18,600
(Number of people: At least 30, any gender)

2575
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:20,170
The starting number is 30.

2576
01:38:20,470 --> 01:38:22,530
The number of people just needs to be 30 or more.

2577
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:24,869
We'll need at least 100 people.

2578
01:38:24,870 --> 01:38:27,709
I want 100 dancers.

2579
01:38:27,710 --> 01:38:28,710
Any gender.

2580
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:31,780
- Any gender! - Any gender!

2581
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:33,549
It's okay to have men.

2582
01:38:33,550 --> 01:38:36,220
Boys!

2583
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,019
- Boys. - Yes!

2584
01:38:38,020 --> 01:38:40,249
Australian males are very talented.

2585
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:41,850
It's going to be very strong.

2586
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:45,989
RHTokyo has male dancers as well.

2587
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:46,990
I'm really excited.

2588
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:50,700
High-angle challenge section.

2589
01:38:51,630 --> 01:38:54,069
- A one-take, top-down shot. - High-angle.

2590
01:38:54,070 --> 01:38:56,470
There's a top camera section.

2591
01:38:56,870 --> 01:38:59,809
(The high-angle challenge section must be visible from the top.)

2592
01:38:59,810 --> 01:39:04,839
(The 20-second choreography will be a key to the performance.)

2593
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:07,149
- That's definitely an upgrade. - Yes.

2594
01:39:07,150 --> 01:39:08,750
It wasn't time to have fun in our bikinis.

2595
01:39:09,010 --> 01:39:11,620
The location to film the top-down shot is important.

2596
01:39:11,780 --> 01:39:13,290
Twenty seconds? That's no problem.

2597
01:39:13,490 --> 01:39:15,849
If the main challenge is what we do overhead,

2598
01:39:15,850 --> 01:39:16,860
I love that stuff.

2599
01:39:17,220 --> 01:39:19,159
I think it's honestly really good for us.

2600
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:21,659
It's perfect for the MOTIV crew. It's perfect for Marlee.

2601
01:39:21,660 --> 01:39:24,159
Marlee has already done something like this in one of her videos,

2602
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:27,929
so it's going to be so easy for her.

2603
01:39:27,930 --> 01:39:29,869
It's our victory already.

2604
01:39:29,870 --> 01:39:31,139
We'll win no matter what.

2605
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:33,269
My strong suit is choreography.

2606
01:39:33,270 --> 01:39:37,480
I thought the mission was my chance to shine.

2607
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:41,909
Seriously, Ruu's talent in controlling a large group is...

2608
01:39:41,910 --> 01:39:43,649
number one in Japan.

2609
01:39:43,650 --> 01:39:46,349
With Ruu in the center,

2610
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:50,220
I'm certain that we'll make an infallible performance.

2611
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:51,490
For victory,

2612
01:39:51,590 --> 01:39:56,829
I want to make preparations and bring out the most of my talent.

2613
01:39:56,830 --> 01:39:59,529
(You must capture your country's energy, story, and identity.)

2614
01:39:59,530 --> 01:40:00,630
(Mega Crew Mission Rules)

2615
01:40:00,700 --> 01:40:03,699
- You must make your country shine. - Yes. You must make it shine.

2616
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:05,040
We need to think hard.

2617
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:06,309
What's the message?

2618
01:40:06,310 --> 01:40:08,110
It just depends on what the message is, honestly.

2619
01:40:08,370 --> 01:40:10,579
Why don't we acknowledge the animals of Australia...

2620
01:40:10,580 --> 01:40:11,609
and base it around them?

2621
01:40:11,610 --> 01:40:13,079
Oh, my gosh. We can do so many things.

2622
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:14,949
We can use males.

2623
01:40:14,950 --> 01:40:16,349
We can get some snakes.

2624
01:40:16,350 --> 01:40:17,519
We can get a crocodile.

2625
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:19,920
We should start with the acknowledgment of the land.

2626
01:40:20,590 --> 01:40:22,020
We have a lot of ideas.

2627
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:25,089
We want to show the audience...

2628
01:40:25,090 --> 01:40:26,959
the culture of Australia.

2629
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:28,659
For the other crews,

2630
01:40:28,660 --> 01:40:32,630
I definitely think we're going to be your biggest threat.

2631
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:36,870
We live and breathe mega crew, so...

2632
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:39,000
I hope you guys bring your best.

2633
01:40:39,340 --> 01:40:41,939
(The crews have a meeting for the Mega Crew Mission.)

2634
01:40:41,940 --> 01:40:45,479
If the overhead is an important aspect of it,

2635
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:47,679
they need to get directly overhead.

2636
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:50,219
We'd have to go into a bigger studio.

2637
01:40:50,220 --> 01:40:52,219
I wonder what they have access to.

2638
01:40:52,220 --> 01:40:53,250
"We're going to the Universal."

2639
01:40:53,690 --> 01:40:55,290
And I also still want to hit up...

2640
01:40:56,620 --> 01:40:58,720
certain people to be special guests.

2641
01:40:59,190 --> 01:41:03,460
My strategy, more than anything,

2642
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:08,399
is just to create something absolutely undeniable.

2643
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:10,970
Originally, MOTIV is a mega crew.

2644
01:41:11,070 --> 01:41:14,409
I'm fully confident in her ability to deliver...

2645
01:41:14,410 --> 01:41:16,510
a masterpiece of a video.

2646
01:41:17,380 --> 01:41:19,579
(The two crews are having a meeting about the same nation, Japan.)

2647
01:41:19,580 --> 01:41:23,150
I want to look into various things about Japan...

2648
01:41:23,550 --> 01:41:25,320
and figure out what we'll express and how.

2649
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:27,220
The Japanese concept.

2650
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:28,889
We should decide if we'll deliver the theme...

2651
01:41:28,890 --> 01:41:31,359
through a song, visuals, or a place.

2652
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:32,990
We should decide how we'll deliver the theme.

2653
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:35,829
Tokyo Tower will be a good place.

2654
01:41:35,830 --> 01:41:39,100
That's the only thing the other crew definitely can't do.

2655
01:41:39,530 --> 01:41:42,569
Tokyo is the symbol of Japan.

2656
01:41:42,570 --> 01:41:45,070
I think it'll be great to capture...

2657
01:41:45,300 --> 01:41:50,139
the Japanese motto in a three-minute video.

2658
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:52,479
We want to represent the nation properly...

2659
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:54,650
and give people the essence of Japan or Osaka...

2660
01:41:54,750 --> 01:41:56,919
in this mission.

2661
01:41:56,920 --> 01:41:58,920
We'll make an impressive masterpiece,

2662
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:01,290
completely change up OSAKA Ojo Gang's image,

2663
01:42:01,820 --> 01:42:03,720
and come back here.

2664
01:42:03,990 --> 01:42:06,430
We've been waiting for the Mega Crew Mission.

2665
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:07,790
We're confident.

2666
01:42:07,890 --> 01:42:10,700
Firstly, Honey J is our leader.

2667
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:12,800
That would be our biggest advantage.

2668
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:14,500
There's no fear.

2669
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:16,299
We've been trampled on so much.

2670
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:19,569
People who have nothing to lose are the scariest.

2671
01:42:19,570 --> 01:42:20,769
We need to land consecutive blows.

2672
01:42:20,770 --> 01:42:23,710
We need to land consecutive blows and make our victory final.

2673
01:42:25,780 --> 01:42:27,680
- Everyone, we've always been... - Yes.

2674
01:42:27,950 --> 01:42:31,679
- sweaty and dirty on TV. - Yes.

2675
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:33,789
Our pallor turned ashen.

2676
01:42:33,790 --> 01:42:35,819
- Yes. - The weather is so nice today.

2677
01:42:35,820 --> 01:42:37,559
- That's right. - Yes. Look at the sky today.

2678
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:39,289
To see the sky properly today,

2679
01:42:39,290 --> 01:42:40,529
we'll go on a drive.

2680
01:42:40,530 --> 01:42:41,689
(We're excited.)

2681
01:42:41,690 --> 01:42:42,829
I love the idea.

2682
01:42:42,830 --> 01:42:45,459
So I prepared something. Let's go.

2683
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:47,330
- What's this? - My goodness.

2684
01:42:47,570 --> 01:42:49,030
- What? - Did you get a new car?

2685
01:42:49,940 --> 01:42:52,169
Honey J got a new car

2686
01:42:52,170 --> 01:42:53,639
(Where did BUMSUP arrive?)

2687
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:54,640
(My goodness)

2688
01:42:54,641 --> 01:42:56,709
- Gosh, this place is big. - My goodness.

2689
01:42:56,710 --> 01:42:59,139
(A car showroom in Seoul)

2690
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:01,080
The showroom is up high.

2691
01:43:01,750 --> 01:43:03,279
Let's go to the second floor.

2692
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:04,420
- Okay. - That sounds good.

2693
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:08,050
(Various cars are displayed on the 2nd floor.)

2694
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:12,589
(They become absorbed in checking out the cars.)

2695
01:43:12,590 --> 01:43:16,060
This is an SUV, but a sportscar.

2696
01:43:16,260 --> 01:43:18,600
- It's like 2 in 1. - Yes. It's like 2 in 1.

2697
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:20,470
Is it an electric car?

2698
01:43:20,570 --> 01:43:23,369
For how long can you ride it once you charge it?

2699
01:43:23,370 --> 01:43:26,199
You can ride it for 429km.

2700
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:27,410
Did she say 429km?

2701
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:31,210
It's so pretty.

2702
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:34,949
(I'm proud of this car.)

2703
01:43:34,950 --> 01:43:36,979
- As a special opportunity, - It's so pretty.

2704
01:43:36,980 --> 01:43:38,750
- It's pretty. - you can try riding this car.

2705
01:43:39,620 --> 01:43:40,620
That's incredible.

2706
01:43:40,621 --> 01:43:42,589
- I talked to them in advance. - It's so pretty.

2707
01:43:42,590 --> 01:43:44,220
(I love it.)

2708
01:43:44,260 --> 01:43:46,190
- You got the key, right? - Yes, I got it.

2709
01:43:46,590 --> 01:43:48,330
Honey J, let's go on a drive.

2710
01:43:49,190 --> 01:43:50,660
- My goodness. - My cellphone is here.

2711
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:51,999
(Let's go.)

2712
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,769
- Honey J. - Bye, everyone.

2713
01:43:53,770 --> 01:43:56,099
- We're leaving all restrictions! - Bye!

2714
01:43:56,100 --> 01:43:57,669
- My goodness. - Bye!

2715
01:43:57,670 --> 01:43:58,870
(They're cute.)

2716
01:43:59,370 --> 01:44:00,710
Shall we go?

2717
01:44:01,140 --> 01:44:02,170
Nice.

2718
01:44:03,810 --> 01:44:05,009
The weather is amazing.

2719
01:44:05,010 --> 01:44:06,010
(BUMSUP hits the road.)

2720
01:44:06,011 --> 01:44:08,509
The weather is good, and I'm feeling good.

2721
01:44:08,510 --> 01:44:10,249
- It's nice. - It's nice.

2722
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:12,149
- The car is nice too. - The car is nice too.

2723
01:44:12,150 --> 01:44:15,289
The comfort is nice. My knees are relaxed.

2724
01:44:15,290 --> 01:44:16,489
How is the backseat?

2725
01:44:16,490 --> 01:44:18,789
It's spacious and comfortable.

2726
01:44:18,790 --> 01:44:20,559
I want to run away since I feel drowsy...

2727
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:21,560
thanks to the heated seat.

2728
01:44:21,830 --> 01:44:23,029
Don't fall asleep.

2729
01:44:23,030 --> 01:44:24,260
You know, it's really nice.

2730
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:27,199
- I want to go someplace fun. - Seriously.

2731
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:29,170
(They have a therapeutic moment through a drive.)

2732
01:44:30,970 --> 01:44:32,500
(Elimination Battle)

2733
01:44:33,710 --> 01:44:37,310
(The second crew will get eliminated on World of Street Woman Fighter.)

2734
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:41,350
(Which bottom two crews will have the Elimination Battle?)

2735
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:43,680
(Mega Crew Final Rehearsal Video)

2736
01:44:44,350 --> 01:44:45,850
(Startled)

2737
01:44:45,950 --> 01:44:47,750
(Mega Crew Final Rehearsal Video)

2738
01:44:48,220 --> 01:44:50,289
(Mega Crew Final Rehearsal Video?)

2739
01:44:50,290 --> 01:44:51,820
(It's a rehearsal video.)

2740
01:44:52,660 --> 01:44:55,360
(The 5 crew's Mega Crew Final Rehearsal videos)

2741
01:44:56,290 --> 01:45:00,300
(And the interim check in the form of the directors' paper)

2742
01:45:00,570 --> 01:45:02,900
(It'll be a disaster if we lose again!)

2743
01:45:03,100 --> 01:45:05,070
(We've lost to them in all the previous rounds!)

2744
01:45:05,170 --> 01:45:06,909
(If we get ranked low, )

2745
01:45:06,910 --> 01:45:08,809
(we'll need to start practicing for the battle.)

2746
01:45:08,810 --> 01:45:11,339
(I honestly don't know what to expect of AG SQUAD.)

2747
01:45:11,340 --> 01:45:13,209
(The storyline was too confusing.)

2748
01:45:13,210 --> 01:45:15,309
(It isn't very put-together.)

2749
01:45:15,310 --> 01:45:17,319
(It's just obviously waccking.)

2750
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:19,749
(You know, maybe the leader just wanted to be...)

2751
01:45:19,750 --> 01:45:22,190
(at the front the whole time. No offense.)

2752
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:24,160
(It's boring.)

2753
01:45:24,260 --> 01:45:26,829
It says, "Each musical section is carefully matched to reflect..."

2754
01:45:26,830 --> 01:45:28,790
"the animal each dancer represents."

2755
01:45:29,290 --> 01:45:30,900
(That's incredible. I want to see the animals.)

2756
01:45:31,230 --> 01:45:33,569
(Vanessa's alligator section)

2757
01:45:33,570 --> 01:45:35,899
(And Danica's snake section)

2758
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:37,039
(Three dingoes)

2759
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:39,339
(Myself, Kaleece, and Alysha)

2760
01:45:39,340 --> 01:45:42,039
(Aaliyah is a Tasmanian devil.)

2761
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:44,540
(Ruthy Baby's section is a spider.)

2762
01:45:44,740 --> 01:45:47,980
(Kaea is a red kangaroo.)

2763
01:45:48,250 --> 01:45:50,380
(AG SQUAD's work is strong.)

2764
01:45:50,620 --> 01:45:52,549
(I think it'll be a shocking video.)

2765
01:45:52,550 --> 01:45:53,550
- Period! - This one says...

2766
01:45:53,790 --> 01:45:55,689
(They filmed it at the Shibuya Scramble Square.)

2767
01:45:55,690 --> 01:45:57,160
(That place is packed.)

2768
01:45:57,260 --> 01:46:00,130
(It'll be incredible if they film it at the Shibuya Scramble Square.)

2769
01:46:00,860 --> 01:46:01,930
(We're...)

2770
01:46:02,430 --> 01:46:05,760
(actually at Shibuya.)

2771
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:07,169
(The actual...)

2772
01:46:07,170 --> 01:46:09,100
(Shibuya)

2773
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:12,569
(We made it possible.)

2774
01:46:12,570 --> 01:46:13,570
(We're proud of ourselves.)

2775
01:46:14,610 --> 01:46:15,870
(The final rankings)

2776
01:46:16,010 --> 01:46:18,539
(What will be the result of the interim check?)

2777
01:46:18,540 --> 01:46:21,109
(These two may go into the elimination round.)

2778
01:46:21,110 --> 01:46:22,310
(In 5th place is...)

2779
01:46:22,650 --> 01:46:23,650
MOTIV.

2780
01:46:23,780 --> 01:46:24,850
(Okay. 5th.)

2781
01:46:25,820 --> 01:46:27,020
(Don't worry. You all forget that this is a competition.)

2782
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:31,190
(Did they rank us as 5th place?)

2783
01:46:31,460 --> 01:46:34,530
(Who challenged us?)

2784
01:46:35,490 --> 01:46:37,229
(I think we're going to battle.)

2785
01:46:37,230 --> 01:46:38,860
(They can bring it on.)

2786
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:40,129
(Versus anyone)

2787
01:46:40,130 --> 01:46:41,130
(Bring it.)

2788
01:46:43,370 --> 01:46:44,970
With the entire world as the stage,

2789
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:47,770
the Mega Crew Mission has been completed.

2790
01:46:49,940 --> 01:46:51,439
The crew that received the least views...

2791
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:53,950
in the Global Public Evaluation...

2792
01:46:54,510 --> 01:46:56,180
is RHTokyo.

2793
01:46:57,350 --> 01:46:59,049
(I'm beginning to feel that...)

2794
01:46:59,050 --> 01:47:02,019
(there's a possibility of going to the Elimination Battle...)

2795
01:47:02,020 --> 01:47:03,620
(for the Mega Crew Mission.)

2796
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:07,060
AG SQUAD is in fourth place.

2797
01:47:07,530 --> 01:47:09,629
(We were fourth in views.)

2798
01:47:09,630 --> 01:47:11,330
(I don't want to battle.)

2799
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:14,270
The number of likes in the Global Public Evaluation...

2800
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:16,940
and the fight judges' score remain,

2801
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:20,340
so no one can predict the final result.

2802
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:22,270
It was a bit cliche.

2803
01:47:22,710 --> 01:47:25,780
I felt like it had suddenly become a TWICE's music video.

2804
01:47:26,510 --> 01:47:29,049
In terms of the fight judges' score, OSAKA Ojo Gang...

2805
01:47:29,050 --> 01:47:30,880
placed fourth.

2806
01:47:31,220 --> 01:47:33,119
(Again, what we feared happened.)

2807
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:34,720
(The Elimination Battle)

2808
01:47:34,890 --> 01:47:37,120
(It put me in a bad mood.)

2809
01:47:37,220 --> 01:47:39,719
The crews that will have the second Elimination Battle...

2810
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:43,260
are...

2811
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:45,530
(Everyone was so shocked.)

2812
01:47:48,530 --> 01:47:52,569
(I don't really agree with these scores.)

2813
01:47:52,570 --> 01:47:55,710
(We put our hearts into this mission.)

2814
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:58,980
(Which 2 crews will have the 2nd Elimination Battle?)
