(World of Street Woman Fighter)

2
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:38,590
- Where are we?
- It's the second from the bottom.

3
00:00:38,591 --> 00:00:39,890
- I see.
- You're right.

4
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:42,520
Why did they put our birth years?

5
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:43,690
Our average age is...

6
00:00:43,691 --> 00:00:46,231
Why isn't there anyone from the 1980s on the other teams?

7
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:48,360
Why are they all so young?

8
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:50,271
- Aaliyah.
- She was born in 2006. Gosh.

9
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:52,800
Monika, you and I are the oldest out of everyone here.

10
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:54,600
(The BUMSUP members were born in 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, and 1990.)

11
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:56,441
- Kaea...
- She was born in 1997?

12
00:00:57,271 --> 00:01:00,441
Everyone in the ROYAL FAMILY is very young too.

13
00:01:01,081 --> 00:01:02,910
They need to get lots of sleep because they're babies.

14
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:05,081
Make sure you adjust to the time difference, babies.

15
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:06,450
(The K-survival show veterans give the other dancers advice.)

16
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:09,281
- Babies.
- This is how spicy it gets.

17
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:11,591
Gosh, it's so spicy. I need water.

18
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:14,721
What are we doing?

19
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:17,460
We're off to our first shoot.

20
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:18,731
Our first shoot.

21
00:01:19,331 --> 00:01:22,630
The waiting room. It is 2:00am.

22
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:25,830
It's just like the draining part of the jet lag.

23
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:26,900
This is how it feels.

24
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:29,201
(Aaliyah, the baby born in 2006, is just excited.)

25
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:32,971
Actually, we came here for the competition. To win.

26
00:01:33,711 --> 00:01:37,681
It's to prove to ourselves that we're capable of doing so.

27
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:41,850
It is definitely really hard, coming into this competition.

28
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,851
Like being on the other side of the world.

29
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:45,721
(Wake up, warriors!)

30
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:46,721
Wake up!

31
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:49,021
Gosh, I'm sleepy.

32
00:01:50,261 --> 00:01:54,061
We flew all the way here on a plane, so we're very tired.

33
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:56,461
And I do miss my family. It's so hard.

34
00:01:56,901 --> 00:02:00,201
And I just feel so lonely, as well.

35
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:03,641
It's my mom. It's her birthday. Can I answer this?

36
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:06,371
(Happy birthday, Bella's mom!)

37
00:02:10,451 --> 00:02:12,310
Bella's so far away.

38
00:02:12,311 --> 00:02:14,551
Stop. You're going to make me cry.

39
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:18,520
You're an amazing creature. Thank you for being my daughter.

40
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:20,591
I love you. I love you so much.

41
00:02:20,691 --> 00:02:22,060
Thanks for being my mom.

42
00:02:22,061 --> 00:02:23,061
(A heartwarming moment)

43
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:24,831
Hi, Hendrix.

44
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:26,491
Why are you not answering me?

45
00:02:26,691 --> 00:02:27,701
(Melting)

46
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:30,830
- It's because I'm out shooting.
- We're...

47
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:31,970
Say "Hi, world."

48
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:32,971
(Smiling)

49
00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:35,440
I love you AG SQUAD. I hope you win.

50
00:02:35,441 --> 00:02:37,210
- Hi, Hendrix.
- Okay, I love you.

51
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:38,440
(Sisterly smiles)

52
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:39,740
(Rie Hata is on a video call with her son.)

53
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:42,410
This is what our room looks like.

54
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:45,881
It says "Team Japan."

55
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:49,920
Everything about this survival show is hard and exhausting,

56
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:52,451
but my kids give me the strength to keep going here.

57
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:56,561
(During break time, Kaea is talking to her son on the phone.)

58
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:59,160
- Hi, babe. This is my youngest.
- Hi, babe.

59
00:02:59,161 --> 00:03:00,361
This one.

60
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:02,601
(Blowing a kiss)

61
00:03:02,602 --> 00:03:04,170
(Her son blows her a kiss back.)

62
00:03:04,171 --> 00:03:05,300
I love you.

63
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:07,001
I miss him so much.

64
00:03:08,001 --> 00:03:09,270
(Feeling a lump in her throat)

65
00:03:09,271 --> 00:03:10,441
Okay, thank you.

66
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:12,471
Sad.

67
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:16,880
I'm here for this.

68
00:03:16,881 --> 00:03:19,211
I'm not here to muck around, you know?

69
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:20,981
So...

70
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:24,920
(Kaea traveled all the way to this foreign country...)

71
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:27,682
(so that her three children could be proud of their mom as a dancer.)

72
00:03:27,961 --> 00:03:29,860
Give me a kiss.

73
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:34,060
I'm doing this for them, so I can set up our lives.

74
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:35,131
I love Mom.

75
00:03:35,631 --> 00:03:37,670
I'm just here to win,

76
00:03:37,671 --> 00:03:40,101
and then I want to go home to my kids, you know?

77
00:03:41,871 --> 00:03:44,541
And I need to make sure that I just do my best.

78
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,380
World of Street Woman Fighter is powered by...

79
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:51,510
product sponsorship and partnership...

80
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:52,951
with a leading K-culture brand.

81
00:03:53,851 --> 00:03:54,851
(Class Mission)

82
00:03:54,852 --> 00:03:56,550
It's famous for being intense.

83
00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:58,390
(We either have to protect or take.)

84
00:03:58,391 --> 00:03:59,790
(We can't let anyone take from us.)

85
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,020
(Choreography, directing)

86
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:03,120
This is my forte.

87
00:04:03,121 --> 00:04:04,921
AG SQUAD's choreography? We can do it easily.

88
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:06,330
Who's the original?

89
00:04:06,331 --> 00:04:07,800
Can't beat originality.

90
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:09,801
Come in and take your choreography.

91
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:12,401
I'm excited to take on their choreography.

92
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:13,741
It's ours.

93
00:04:13,801 --> 00:04:16,201
They understood this choreography and just killed it.

94
00:04:16,301 --> 00:04:17,410
(Main Dancer Audition results)

95
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:18,740
(Their choreography was taken.)

96
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:19,840
AG SQUAD.

97
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:21,380
Can I say one thing?

98
00:04:21,381 --> 00:04:24,210
We appreciate that you guys made this choreography really shine.

99
00:04:24,211 --> 00:04:28,321
Keep this noted that the Korean team was very nice when teaching us.

100
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:29,381
(Even in the heat of the fierce class competition, )

101
00:04:29,382 --> 00:04:31,091
(new friendships took root.)

102
00:04:32,151 --> 00:04:33,590
They're the backup dancers.

103
00:04:33,591 --> 00:04:34,620
They're the trees.

104
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:36,290
Australia, tiniest bit out.

105
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,461
They were taking it as if we were the back dancers.

106
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:40,130
Hey, if they're trying to play the game...

107
00:04:40,131 --> 00:04:41,537
(The real class wars are about to unfold.)

108
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:42,761
Same, losers.

109
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:44,771
You all want to see our photos?

110
00:04:44,931 --> 00:04:45,970
(Distracted)

111
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:47,070
(Restless)

112
00:04:47,071 --> 00:04:48,300
We should check the light.

113
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:49,640
Guys.

114
00:04:49,641 --> 00:04:51,141
This is where I belong.

115
00:04:51,271 --> 00:04:53,617
(It's the main dancer's ultimate right to name the worst dancer.)

116
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:56,610
The crew that we've chosen has made it kind of easy for us.

117
00:04:56,611 --> 00:04:58,911
The worst dancer is...

118
00:04:59,181 --> 00:05:00,951
(Who will be picked as the worst dancer?)

119
00:05:01,821 --> 00:05:03,520
All I had in life was dance.

120
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:05,891
My confidence took a hit.

121
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:37,390
Finally, it's time for the battle...

122
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:39,390
to determine the main dancer of the leader class,

123
00:05:39,391 --> 00:05:43,490
where each team's pride and each country's pride is on the line.

124
00:05:43,491 --> 00:05:44,961
(The highlight of the Class Mission)

125
00:05:45,031 --> 00:05:46,430
Let's go, Marlee.

126
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:49,201
- Go, Teesha!
- Teesha!

127
00:05:49,231 --> 00:05:50,331
Yes, baby!

128
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:52,200
Kaea!

129
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:53,470
Go, Kaea!

130
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:55,801
- You got this!
- Let's go!

131
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:58,941
- Three, two, one. RHTokyo!
- RHTokyo!

132
00:05:59,111 --> 00:06:00,810
- Honey J!
- Honey J!

133
00:06:00,811 --> 00:06:02,340
Honey J!

134
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:05,111
You're so beautiful! Gosh!

135
00:06:05,381 --> 00:06:06,910
This is about to be so sick.

136
00:06:06,911 --> 00:06:08,020
This is going to be intense.

137
00:06:08,021 --> 00:06:09,381
This is between the leader class.

138
00:06:10,151 --> 00:06:12,520
Honey J, you had made it to the final round,

139
00:06:12,521 --> 00:06:13,790
but your choreography wasn't chosen.

140
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,421
You have to bet everything here.

141
00:06:15,491 --> 00:06:17,791
Yes, I will do my best today and take the choreography.

142
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,361
I was very disappointed.

143
00:06:21,031 --> 00:06:22,461
That was so close.

144
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:24,930
I have no choice but to accept it, though.

145
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:26,247
I just have to take the choreography.

146
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:29,400
I'm going to be the best dancer in Rie Hata's choreography.

147
00:06:29,401 --> 00:06:30,940
What's done is done.

148
00:06:30,941 --> 00:06:32,610
Learn the choreography with a positive attitude and...

149
00:06:32,611 --> 00:06:33,640
I will.

150
00:06:33,641 --> 00:06:36,281
- I'll work hard and be good.
- Just stick to what you usually do.

151
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:38,981
I have to be good. That's what a leader is supposed to do.

152
00:06:39,281 --> 00:06:42,201
(The leader class began learning and practicing Rie Hata's choreography.)

153
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:44,521
The choreography wasn't that difficult.

154
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:45,921
Can you show me one more time?

155
00:06:45,991 --> 00:06:47,890
- Is it one turn? Two?
- Two.

156
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:48,961
- Rie.
- Yes.

157
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:52,490
- Keep low?
- Keep low. Low there and just...

158
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:53,877
(Honey J actively asks questions as she learns Rie Hata's choreography.)

159
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:55,831
I thought I'd be able to do it with practice.

160
00:06:57,571 --> 00:06:59,477
(Ibuki asks Rie Hata questions easily in Japanese.)

161
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:01,470
- Is this right?
- Yes.

162
00:07:01,471 --> 00:07:03,311
How should I put it? Tilt your torso backward.

163
00:07:03,641 --> 00:07:05,940
There's definitely a language barrier.

164
00:07:05,941 --> 00:07:08,257
(Honey J still remains focused and dedicates herself to practice.)

165
00:07:08,281 --> 00:07:11,050
It's like we're collaborating at Fair Play.

166
00:07:11,051 --> 00:07:12,381
- Right.
- Right.

167
00:07:12,751 --> 00:07:14,480
Last year, I saw your class.

168
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:16,481
Yes, that's where I saw you first.

169
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:18,420
I felt like there was a wall.

170
00:07:18,421 --> 00:07:20,521
There was a disconnect between me and the others.

171
00:07:20,891 --> 00:07:22,861
- Do you guys need water?
- Yes.

172
00:07:23,931 --> 00:07:25,830
(Honey J felt out of sync...)

173
00:07:25,831 --> 00:07:28,501
(due to language barriers and lack of common ground.)

174
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:30,970
I feel so left out.

175
00:07:30,971 --> 00:07:33,630
They talk among themselves and it's not like my English is good,

176
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,270
so I can't really walk up to them and join in, you know?

177
00:07:36,271 --> 00:07:39,270
- Is the language barrier too high?
- I wish I was more globally famous.

178
00:07:39,271 --> 00:07:41,481
That's something that was stuck in my head a lot today.

179
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:44,810
I've mainly been active within Korea,

180
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:46,980
and it really hit me hard today.

181
00:07:46,981 --> 00:07:48,620
I've been stuck in my little pond this whole time.

182
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:49,820
Even if I'm...

183
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:51,981
- a good dancer in Korea, - Even if you're the best...

184
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,261
all of them are from abroad.

185
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:57,830
I respect you so much for realizing it...

186
00:07:57,831 --> 00:07:58,890
and accepting it.

187
00:07:58,891 --> 00:08:01,231
Had I been in your shoes, I might've wanted to deny it.

188
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:03,500
You're the winner of Street Woman Fighter.

189
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:04,570
That's right.

190
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:06,100
It's thanks to your hard work...

191
00:08:06,101 --> 00:08:09,040
that World of Street Woman Fighter came to be.

192
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,140
It's thanks to your continuous work in Korea...

193
00:08:11,141 --> 00:08:13,241
that your style of dance became a genre here.

194
00:08:14,981 --> 00:08:17,880
Firstly, I'll do really well this time.

195
00:08:17,881 --> 00:08:20,950
Rie Hata is the queen of trendiness...

196
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:21,980
- in a sense.
- That's right.

197
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:23,680
I'll show everyone tomorrow...

198
00:08:23,681 --> 00:08:27,420
that I can pull off Rie Hata's choreography.

199
00:08:27,421 --> 00:08:29,921
Of course. Honey J, you can totally do it.

200
00:08:30,461 --> 00:08:32,591
I was so thankful for the members.

201
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:33,830
Tomorrow is an important day.

202
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:36,101
In the end, it's a fight between the main dancers.

203
00:08:36,761 --> 00:08:38,470
There's a lot of control in power.

204
00:08:38,471 --> 00:08:41,171
- Leejung, I'll need your help.
- Okay.

205
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:45,417
The choreography suited me well. I thought, "What? I can do this."

206
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,241
I must win. There's no other choice than to make it mine.

207
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:50,610
Yes.

208
00:08:50,611 --> 00:08:53,411
I have a lot of pressure because I'm the leader.

209
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:55,980
And I like to show it, especially to my sister.

210
00:08:55,981 --> 00:08:58,251
She'll give me her honest opinion.

211
00:08:58,751 --> 00:08:59,891
Ho!

212
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:02,690
Add your own little swagger.

213
00:09:02,691 --> 00:09:04,131
You don't have to look like her.

214
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:05,261
Okay.

215
00:09:05,591 --> 00:09:07,960
I don't get hungry. I don't get thirsty.

216
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:10,701
I'll keep trying until I run out of time to practice.

217
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:13,771
I feel like Teesha actually does it better than Kaea.

218
00:09:14,241 --> 00:09:16,171
Teesha did so well.

219
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:18,310
I'm making sure...

220
00:09:18,311 --> 00:09:20,211
that I kill it in front of the judges.

221
00:09:20,441 --> 00:09:23,141
I have to worry about Teesha And Rie.

222
00:09:23,241 --> 00:09:25,380
Marlee has so much passion.

223
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:26,751
I can tell that she wants to win.

224
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:29,450
You know what it's like. She keeps standing next to me.

225
00:09:29,451 --> 00:09:30,690
(Focused)

226
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:32,497
She seems to be thinking, "I'll memorize it first."

227
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:34,097
Marlee memorized the choreography quickly.

228
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:35,201
I bet she's practicing now.

229
00:09:35,691 --> 00:09:36,691
(She's correct. Marlee is practicing.)

230
00:09:36,692 --> 00:09:38,161
Hey, that's clean.

231
00:09:39,331 --> 00:09:40,931
Yes. I can't see Ibuki doing that.

232
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:43,801
Yes. I don't think Ibuki will win.

233
00:09:44,201 --> 00:09:45,681
Ibuki does it better than I expected.

234
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:46,870
- Ibuki...
- She's a good dancer.

235
00:09:46,871 --> 00:09:48,000
She knows how to waack,

236
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:49,040
so she keeps the movements tasteful.

237
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,470
When I tried the choreography,

238
00:09:50,471 --> 00:09:52,841
it wasn't impossible.

239
00:09:53,271 --> 00:09:55,340
I think this is a good chance...

240
00:09:55,341 --> 00:09:57,880
to show that I'm not only good at waacking.

241
00:09:57,881 --> 00:09:59,550
So that I can be the main dancer,

242
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,851
I'll do my best.

243
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:03,820
Rie, are you confident...

244
00:10:03,821 --> 00:10:06,051
that you'll be chosen as the main dancer?

245
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:10,061
I usually make the choreography for a K-pop song.

246
00:10:10,421 --> 00:10:12,361
I gave it to someone else.

247
00:10:13,191 --> 00:10:17,500
My career began as Lady Gaga's backup dancer...

248
00:10:17,501 --> 00:10:19,001
at the age of 18.

249
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:23,440
Now, I work as a choreographer.

250
00:10:23,441 --> 00:10:27,410
Since I'm a choreographer, I'm used to not doing the routine I made.

251
00:10:27,411 --> 00:10:30,581
Thus, BTS will do my choreography and make it shine.

252
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:34,851
G-DRAGON will do my choreography and make it shine.

253
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:39,851
No matter how big the stage is, I'm a star's backup dancer.

254
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:44,431
I've worked as a dancer that way for several years.

255
00:10:44,531 --> 00:10:47,190
But this time, we'll make a dance video...

256
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:50,830
in which the dancers will shine instead of the artist.

257
00:10:50,831 --> 00:10:53,031
We rarely get such a chance.

258
00:10:53,301 --> 00:10:55,771
It's a chance for a dancer to receive the spotlight.

259
00:10:56,141 --> 00:10:58,211
This time, I made a choreography...

260
00:10:58,311 --> 00:11:02,041
for the dance video for the dancers.

261
00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:03,461
So I want to be the main dancer.

262
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:08,321
- She's cool.
- She's cool indeed.

263
00:11:08,451 --> 00:11:10,620
Six dancers need to compete,

264
00:11:10,621 --> 00:11:13,191
so three dancers will go at a time.

265
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:15,460
But the three dancers will switch positions...

266
00:11:15,461 --> 00:11:17,531
and dance three times.

267
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,961
They're going to each have a chance to take the center.

268
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,400
Maybe that's why they're doing it three times.

269
00:11:22,401 --> 00:11:24,401
Every time, they have someone new take the center.

270
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:28,001
The Main Dancer Audition for the leader class starts now.

271
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:31,271
You'll switch positions anyway. You need to do well now.

272
00:11:31,371 --> 00:11:33,211
Why am I going first? I'm nervous.

273
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:34,611
Let's go.

274
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:36,581
Ready? Fight!

275
00:11:36,681 --> 00:11:38,281
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

276
00:11:39,381 --> 00:11:41,251
I have confidence in becoming the main dancer.

277
00:11:41,351 --> 00:11:42,750
Let's go, Marlee!

278
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:44,120
I felt confident.

279
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:46,151
Honey J, don't get pressured. Just have fun.

280
00:11:46,651 --> 00:11:47,790
I was so desperate.

281
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,660
I decided to show my real self.

282
00:11:49,661 --> 00:11:51,030
- Have fun.
- Hey.

283
00:11:51,031 --> 00:11:52,090
(Let's focus, Janell.)

284
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:55,661
(The center of the first group, BUMSUP's Honey J)

285
00:11:59,571 --> 00:12:01,471
Let's go, Honey J. Let's go.

286
00:12:01,641 --> 00:12:03,671
(Concentrating)

287
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,741
I'll show it properly at the front.

288
00:12:10,951 --> 00:12:12,451
Hey.

289
00:12:12,651 --> 00:12:14,221
Let's go!

290
00:12:15,451 --> 00:12:17,081
You're good. You're doing well.

291
00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:20,151
Come on, Marlee! Let's go!

292
00:12:23,991 --> 00:12:25,291
(Cheering)

293
00:12:27,091 --> 00:12:29,801
I decided to make it powerful as if my life depended on it.

294
00:12:30,301 --> 00:12:31,371
You're so cool.

295
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:34,641
Honey J, you're so cool. This is insane.

296
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:37,041
(Her power is at its max.)

297
00:12:40,311 --> 00:12:42,811
- Out of us three, I'm the best.
- Let's go!

298
00:12:43,011 --> 00:12:44,611
(She's the best.)

299
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:47,581
I think everyone's attention will be on me.

300
00:12:48,451 --> 00:12:49,451
(Our leader is good.)

301
00:12:51,621 --> 00:12:53,091
Let's do this!

302
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:00,861
You're cool!

303
00:13:01,201 --> 00:13:02,331
(I have so much respect.)

304
00:13:02,731 --> 00:13:04,201
It was incredible.

305
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:05,770
You did so well.

306
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:07,701
That was crazy.

307
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,971
(Let's go, Marlee.)

308
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:12,671
I'm ready.

309
00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:15,081
I'm about to show everyone who I am.

310
00:13:15,381 --> 00:13:17,110
Honey J!

311
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:18,211
Ibuki, good luck!

312
00:13:19,351 --> 00:13:20,351
Come on.

313
00:13:20,352 --> 00:13:23,020
I'm so focused on making sure that I shine...

314
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:24,791
amongst Ibuki and Honey J.

315
00:13:25,851 --> 00:13:27,791
(Their attention is on her.)

316
00:13:30,861 --> 00:13:33,291
And I think the thing that sticks out is my big hair.

317
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:34,731
(The power of curly hair)

318
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:37,001
Honey J, don't lower your energy. Keep going.

319
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:39,401
I need to do well. I can't let them get ahead.

320
00:13:40,131 --> 00:13:42,101
I'll show my unique power.

321
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:51,281
She's too locked in.

322
00:13:51,881 --> 00:13:52,881
(We're getting absorbed.)

323
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:57,121
But it was too small. I wish she did something bigger.

324
00:13:59,121 --> 00:14:01,861
I really need to be the main dancer.

325
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:03,021
Come on, Honey J.

326
00:14:04,061 --> 00:14:05,930
I'm jealous of the Americans.

327
00:14:05,931 --> 00:14:08,001
They look fine even when things are a bit awkward.

328
00:14:09,901 --> 00:14:10,901
(Attacking with her gaze)

329
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:13,101
(She loves it.)

330
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:16,601
It was weak.

331
00:14:17,401 --> 00:14:18,570
(Screaming)

332
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:20,611
What are we talking about?

333
00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:22,680
(The center of the first group, OSAKA Ojo Gang's Ibuki)

334
00:14:22,681 --> 00:14:24,011
Let's go!

335
00:14:24,251 --> 00:14:27,451
Honey J, it's the last round. Have fun!

336
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:29,080
One more!

337
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:30,757
Isn't it exhausting to do the dance three times?

338
00:14:30,781 --> 00:14:33,021
- Let's go!
- Come on, OSAKA!

339
00:14:33,151 --> 00:14:34,221
Let's go!

340
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:37,890
So that I can show my strength with hip-hop dance as well,

341
00:14:37,891 --> 00:14:38,891
I'll do my best.

342
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:48,171
She's cool.

343
00:14:48,271 --> 00:14:49,571
Let's go.

344
00:14:50,601 --> 00:14:53,111
I'm confident that I'll catch people's eyes.

345
00:14:54,641 --> 00:14:55,880
You're cool!

346
00:14:55,881 --> 00:14:57,141
She's giving it a variety.

347
00:15:00,611 --> 00:15:02,581
Ibuki, let's go!

348
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,391
(Focused)

349
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:08,891
She doesn't have power. Like, control.

350
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,801
(Her eyes move to another dancer.)

351
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:19,000
Hip-hop choreography isn't something that she's the strongest at.

352
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,871
I definitely don't think that she'll win the mission.

353
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,871
I'll be the main dancer no matter what.

354
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,171
I'll show them until the very end.

355
00:15:26,311 --> 00:15:28,211
Go, Honey J! Let's go!

356
00:15:29,441 --> 00:15:31,281
It's coming to an end! Let's keep running!

357
00:15:36,781 --> 00:15:37,821
Right there!

358
00:15:39,491 --> 00:15:40,620
Yes, Korea!

359
00:15:40,621 --> 00:15:42,861
(The first group is done with the Main Dancer Audition.)

360
00:15:43,261 --> 00:15:44,261
(They nailed it.)

361
00:15:44,262 --> 00:15:47,131
Let's go!

362
00:15:47,461 --> 00:15:49,800
Rie, please do well!

363
00:15:49,801 --> 00:15:51,731
Let's go, Teesha!

364
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:53,371
Come on, Kaea.

365
00:15:53,571 --> 00:15:54,970
Let's go, ladies.

366
00:15:54,971 --> 00:15:56,470
Oh, Rie Hata.

367
00:15:56,471 --> 00:15:59,441
She's the original choreographer, so I'm wary of her.

368
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,581
My biggest rival in the leader class is Rie.

369
00:16:02,681 --> 00:16:04,181
Ready? Fight!

370
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:07,281
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

371
00:16:07,411 --> 00:16:08,720
The other two should do their best.

372
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:10,451
I'll show what I can do in the center.

373
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:14,121
I needed to save my energy for my turn in the center.

374
00:16:14,221 --> 00:16:15,590
I was confident,

375
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:18,230
smashing it and giving it my all.

376
00:16:18,231 --> 00:16:20,690
- Three, two, one.
- Three, two, one.

377
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:21,901
Let's go, queen!

378
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,771
I'll show everyone. They'd better watch carefully.

379
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:29,501
(Absorbed)

380
00:16:29,941 --> 00:16:31,111
Go, Teesha!

381
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:33,271
She has an edge.

382
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:37,411
She's unrivaled.

383
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:39,481
Yes!

384
00:16:39,881 --> 00:16:41,221
(Focused)

385
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:46,350
There you go!

386
00:16:46,351 --> 00:16:47,351
(Cheering)

387
00:16:48,461 --> 00:16:49,521
It's insane.

388
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:54,290
I can't see the other two.

389
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,501
I can only see Rie.

390
00:16:58,731 --> 00:17:02,241
I had more energetic and powerful moves.

391
00:17:03,071 --> 00:17:04,441
Yes, Teesha!

392
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:08,480
It isn't a song where you force big movements.

393
00:17:08,481 --> 00:17:09,711
She dances in a tasteful way.

394
00:17:09,741 --> 00:17:10,981
(How tasteful)

395
00:17:12,511 --> 00:17:13,611
Hey!

396
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,051
- Rie!
- Let's go, queen!

397
00:17:21,761 --> 00:17:22,761
(She's so good.)

398
00:17:22,762 --> 00:17:24,061
(His excitement explodes.)

399
00:17:24,161 --> 00:17:26,401
Honey J has a chance of winning. Her style is different.

400
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:28,907
- Teesha.
- Teesha? This is incredible.

401
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:29,931
Come on!

402
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:33,071
- Come on, Teesha.
- Let's get it moving!

403
00:17:33,371 --> 00:17:36,941
My aura and my energy give the main dancer.

404
00:17:37,671 --> 00:17:38,871
I want this spot.

405
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:41,111
(That's a good pose!)

406
00:17:41,211 --> 00:17:42,211
(Expectant)

407
00:17:46,851 --> 00:17:47,851
Come on, Teesha!

408
00:17:49,221 --> 00:17:51,851
Breathe, Teesha. Go, Teesha. Let's go!

409
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:56,861
Rie Hata looks cool, but Teesha has good energy.

410
00:17:57,491 --> 00:17:58,491
Go!

411
00:17:58,491 --> 00:17:59,491
(Power up!)

412
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:05,630
(Exclaiming)

413
00:18:05,631 --> 00:18:06,701
(Amazed)

414
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:09,071
(Monstrous power)

415
00:18:09,741 --> 00:18:11,001
Yes, Teesha!

416
00:18:11,711 --> 00:18:12,711
That's good.

417
00:18:12,712 --> 00:18:13,771
Teesha is good too.

418
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:15,281
It's bold.

419
00:18:18,611 --> 00:18:19,611
Crazy.

420
00:18:19,611 --> 00:18:20,611
(Agreeing)

421
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:24,320
The power is a little gone.

422
00:18:24,321 --> 00:18:25,791
- Bye.
- Bye.

423
00:18:27,251 --> 00:18:29,161
(Good girl)

424
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:31,191
Come on.

425
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:33,491
Go!

426
00:18:33,492 --> 00:18:36,400
- Last one!
- Come on, Kaea!

427
00:18:36,401 --> 00:18:37,930
- Kaea!
- Kaea!

428
00:18:37,931 --> 00:18:39,270
One more!

429
00:18:39,271 --> 00:18:40,770
- One more!
- Let's go.

430
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:42,370
Breathe, Rie Hata.

431
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,371
This is going to be hard.

432
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,170
Go!

433
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:47,770
I'm the type of dancer that loves being in the middle.

434
00:18:47,771 --> 00:18:49,580
It's like my place to be in the middle.

435
00:18:49,581 --> 00:18:51,551
Let's go!

436
00:18:53,181 --> 00:18:54,620
Go!

437
00:18:54,621 --> 00:18:56,281
(Anticipating)

438
00:18:57,421 --> 00:18:59,321
(Charismatic)

439
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:00,790
Check out the energy.

440
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,721
The red person has an aura too.

441
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:05,291
Come on.

442
00:19:17,771 --> 00:19:18,771
(Getting goosebumps)

443
00:19:18,772 --> 00:19:20,741
She's really good at controlling the dynamics.

444
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:23,881
Go!

445
00:19:24,911 --> 00:19:28,050
For sure, I feel like I'm stronger than other leaders.

446
00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:29,321
Yes, Teesha!

447
00:19:29,681 --> 00:19:34,151
I'm the person who can dance my choreography most attractively.

448
00:19:34,861 --> 00:19:35,891
I've got to fight harder.

449
00:19:36,321 --> 00:19:38,631
(Keep moving!)

450
00:19:39,861 --> 00:19:40,861
Rie Hata!

451
00:19:42,231 --> 00:19:43,931
It's unique.

452
00:19:49,601 --> 00:19:50,701
She has star quality.

453
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:52,811
She has the main dancer's energy.

454
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:55,340
She made it her own.

455
00:19:55,341 --> 00:19:56,740
Rie Hata did so well.

456
00:19:56,741 --> 00:19:57,980
It was no joke.

457
00:19:57,981 --> 00:19:59,711
Everyone did well.

458
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:01,951
(I'm not going to see this.)

459
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:03,181
(They expect hardship.)

460
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:05,590
The other two were tall.

461
00:20:05,591 --> 00:20:07,050
I'm very short.

462
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:08,420
No, it was really great.

463
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:11,090
You had the main dancer's energy the whole time.

464
00:20:11,091 --> 00:20:12,661
It was really good.

465
00:20:13,131 --> 00:20:16,161
Rie Hata and you looked really cool. It was great.

466
00:20:18,331 --> 00:20:19,331
(Breathing)

467
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:21,547
It looks like we'll go once again, right?

468
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:23,441
Please. Honey J has to go again.

469
00:20:23,671 --> 00:20:25,210
Marlee ate that up too.

470
00:20:25,211 --> 00:20:26,310
Rie Hata was awesome.

471
00:20:26,311 --> 00:20:27,440
Teesha as well.

472
00:20:27,441 --> 00:20:29,380
It's fun with the leaders.

473
00:20:29,381 --> 00:20:30,381
(Breathing)

474
00:20:30,641 --> 00:20:33,010
Total respects.

475
00:20:33,011 --> 00:20:36,850
That is just the highest level.

476
00:20:36,851 --> 00:20:37,950
(Thank you)

477
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:39,591
- Yes!
- Thank you.

478
00:20:40,191 --> 00:20:42,020
Kaea and Teesha,

479
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:46,360
you guys were the most clear with the choreography.

480
00:20:46,361 --> 00:20:48,260
I saw every single sentence.

481
00:20:48,261 --> 00:20:50,560
I was like, "I understand that. That was a move."

482
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:53,600
"That was a ticky tick and..." You know what I mean?

483
00:20:53,601 --> 00:20:57,340
For some reason, I keep on finding a lot of similarities...

484
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:59,540
between your crew and their crew.

485
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,240
I was literally about to say that.

486
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:03,010
I think that's going to be your challenge...

487
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,180
because you're always going to be compared to.

488
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,550
Teesha ate that up.

489
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:07,551
Kaea.

490
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:11,280
Marlee, you definitely had the most personality,

491
00:21:11,281 --> 00:21:13,851
the most facial expressions, the most connection.

492
00:21:14,721 --> 00:21:16,260
With your competition, though,

493
00:21:16,261 --> 00:21:20,230
the whole thing may have been a little too milky for me.

494
00:21:20,231 --> 00:21:22,330
What I wanted was some bits of Oreos there.

495
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:23,331
Do you know what I'm saying?

496
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:25,530
Too milky. I'm like, "I want that crunch."

497
00:21:25,531 --> 00:21:27,400
Do you know what I'm saying? I want that crunch.

498
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:29,700
I wanted a little more power.

499
00:21:29,701 --> 00:21:32,470
Honey J, I feel like you just have the swag.

500
00:21:32,471 --> 00:21:35,640
It's the Korean swag that you just carry.

501
00:21:35,641 --> 00:21:38,250
I feel intimidated when I see it. Straight up.

502
00:21:38,251 --> 00:21:42,450
Power. You are a powerful dancer.

503
00:21:42,451 --> 00:21:44,580
I feel like what I need from you, though,

504
00:21:44,581 --> 00:21:46,520
is a little bit more texture.

505
00:21:46,521 --> 00:21:49,320
Ibuki too. It's like attack, attack.

506
00:21:49,321 --> 00:21:51,860
The moves may have been a little too jumbled up.

507
00:21:51,861 --> 00:21:55,030
I couldn't really tell what was happening sometimes.

508
00:21:55,031 --> 00:21:56,931
And of course, Rie Hata,

509
00:21:57,261 --> 00:21:59,470
I feel, is all the things.

510
00:21:59,471 --> 00:22:03,300
Swag, presence. Also, she's so smart.

511
00:22:03,301 --> 00:22:06,740
Underlying... Underneath all of the rawness,

512
00:22:06,741 --> 00:22:09,540
there is still such an intentional...

513
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,481
"This is why I'm going to do this."

514
00:22:11,811 --> 00:22:14,551
I think I want to see the queen in you, though.

515
00:22:14,981 --> 00:22:17,120
We can be soft, we can be flirty.

516
00:22:17,121 --> 00:22:18,850
And what I'm looking for is someone who gives me...

517
00:22:18,851 --> 00:22:20,591
the entire package.

518
00:22:21,051 --> 00:22:22,061
Clear for me.

519
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,260
They're just too similar.

520
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:25,261
There's no point.

521
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:27,190
Even though she was more powerful,

522
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:29,830
it was like Terminator or too machine-like.

523
00:22:29,831 --> 00:22:32,971
She's like the daughter. The daughter of this machine.

524
00:22:33,701 --> 00:22:34,940
She killed it.

525
00:22:34,941 --> 00:22:37,200
Her attitude. You could see how much she wanted it.

526
00:22:37,201 --> 00:22:39,240
- But her interpretation...
- Goodness.

527
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:42,440
I feel like the levels of complexity that she's showing...

528
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:44,510
The level is just higher.

529
00:22:44,511 --> 00:22:47,411
You can go as hard as you want, but her level...

530
00:22:47,811 --> 00:22:48,821
Who do you like?

531
00:22:48,921 --> 00:22:50,050
I want to see her.

532
00:22:50,051 --> 00:22:51,051
Got it.

533
00:22:51,321 --> 00:22:52,651
Unfortunately,

534
00:22:53,391 --> 00:22:54,651
two of you have to dance again.

535
00:22:55,061 --> 00:22:56,461
Rie Hata and Teesha.

536
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:59,061
Honey J... - Honey J and Rie Hata?

537
00:22:59,331 --> 00:23:00,561
These are the two dancers...

538
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:03,531
who will dance for the last time.

539
00:23:04,501 --> 00:23:05,501
Rie Hata...

540
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:07,971
and

541
00:23:09,171 --> 00:23:10,171
Honey J.

542
00:23:10,171 --> 00:23:11,171
(Rie Hata and Honey J)

543
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:12,371
(Relieved)

544
00:23:12,941 --> 00:23:14,211
Well done. You did a good job.

545
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:16,011
- Good job.
- Thank you.

546
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,311
It was the best.

547
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,451
You did good, girl.

548
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,011
- Good job.
- Thank you.

549
00:23:21,951 --> 00:23:24,151
I suddenly felt the pressure.

550
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:27,250
I thought I had to show them something cool as the leader,

551
00:23:27,251 --> 00:23:29,761
and I wanted to get the main dancer position.

552
00:23:30,491 --> 00:23:32,660
I can't lose now.

553
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,961
I thought about how I could do it well and effectively.

554
00:23:37,461 --> 00:23:39,330
The last battle of the day, ladies.

555
00:23:39,331 --> 00:23:41,331
It's the last party!

556
00:23:41,401 --> 00:23:43,601
- Rie Hata is the best.
- Ready?

557
00:23:43,901 --> 00:23:45,410
RHTokyo is waiting.

558
00:23:45,411 --> 00:23:47,641
I definitely want to become the main dancer.

559
00:23:47,811 --> 00:23:49,210
Hey! Bring it up!

560
00:23:49,211 --> 00:23:51,081
Do everything you want!

561
00:23:51,381 --> 00:23:53,380
I was given the last chance.

562
00:23:53,381 --> 00:23:55,020
I definitely should become the main dancer.

563
00:23:55,021 --> 00:23:56,351
I won't give up until the end.

564
00:23:56,781 --> 00:23:58,690
Whose backup dancer...

565
00:23:58,691 --> 00:24:01,220
will Ibuki be?

566
00:24:01,221 --> 00:24:02,360
- Let's go!
- Ready?

567
00:24:02,361 --> 00:24:03,461
Okay, let's go!

568
00:24:03,991 --> 00:24:05,091
Fight!

569
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,590
I thought I would win.

570
00:24:07,591 --> 00:24:10,430
I think my dance suits the music...

571
00:24:10,431 --> 00:24:12,200
and is pleasant to watch.

572
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,700
Since my dance could be compared to the original dancer's,

573
00:24:14,701 --> 00:24:16,601
I wanted to show myself more.

574
00:24:25,411 --> 00:24:26,451
(Focused)

575
00:24:26,811 --> 00:24:28,980
I must take this.

576
00:24:28,981 --> 00:24:31,021
I really wanted to win.

577
00:24:31,821 --> 00:24:33,490
To show them the queen,

578
00:24:33,491 --> 00:24:35,971
I thought I should show them something different in the intro.

579
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:39,991
- Go, Rie Hata!
- Let's go, Honey J!

580
00:24:40,231 --> 00:24:42,731
Don't look at her! Just do your thing!

581
00:24:43,001 --> 00:24:44,261
(Amazed)

582
00:24:46,331 --> 00:24:47,531
They're like a duo.

583
00:24:49,271 --> 00:24:50,271
Let's go.

584
00:24:50,272 --> 00:24:52,171
Go!

585
00:24:57,281 --> 00:24:59,151
Honey J, let's go!

586
00:25:03,851 --> 00:25:04,951
Let's go!

587
00:25:05,491 --> 00:25:06,720
I danced my best.

588
00:25:06,721 --> 00:25:08,861
I danced with 200 percent power.

589
00:25:09,461 --> 00:25:10,461
(Our leader is the best.)

590
00:25:10,721 --> 00:25:12,231
This is dangerous.

591
00:25:18,931 --> 00:25:20,301
(Everyone is shocked.)

592
00:25:21,101 --> 00:25:22,941
(It's a perfect symmetry.)

593
00:25:25,141 --> 00:25:26,741
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

594
00:25:26,971 --> 00:25:27,971
What was that?

595
00:25:28,411 --> 00:25:30,980
She's cool.

596
00:25:30,981 --> 00:25:32,910
That's our queen!

597
00:25:32,911 --> 00:25:34,811
- Did you see the symmetry?
- That was amazing.

598
00:25:34,981 --> 00:25:36,480
It was so cool.

599
00:25:36,481 --> 00:25:38,151
This is really hard.

600
00:25:38,421 --> 00:25:40,621
That was so fire.

601
00:25:41,251 --> 00:25:42,960
(It was a close battle until the end.)

602
00:25:42,961 --> 00:25:44,561
(Feeling tension in the neck)

603
00:25:44,721 --> 00:25:46,160
- I think Honey J won.
- But...

604
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:47,791
She just overpowered it.

605
00:25:48,231 --> 00:25:49,501
I want Honey J to be selected.

606
00:25:50,101 --> 00:25:52,377
I don't care who gets selected as long as it's not RHTokyo.

607
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:53,471
It's going to be Rie Hata.

608
00:25:53,771 --> 00:25:54,941
We won this.

609
00:25:55,141 --> 00:25:58,471
Rie Hata looked so cool at the end too.

610
00:25:58,941 --> 00:26:00,370
So, Honey J. I feel like she...

611
00:26:00,371 --> 00:26:02,881
That battle, she killed it.

612
00:26:03,381 --> 00:26:05,450
I loved her emotions over her.

613
00:26:05,451 --> 00:26:09,151
I do have the respect. In the room, there was commanding there.

614
00:26:09,421 --> 00:26:13,951
But then someone is connected to the music at a deeper level.

615
00:26:15,261 --> 00:26:17,061
I'll announce the result.

616
00:26:17,791 --> 00:26:22,161
As far as Honey J goes, your spirit is just so powerful.

617
00:26:22,231 --> 00:26:25,170
It's not always just about your musicality,

618
00:26:25,171 --> 00:26:26,430
your timing, or your body control.

619
00:26:26,431 --> 00:26:30,100
A lot of it is just aura that's unexplainable in the room.

620
00:26:30,101 --> 00:26:32,070
So, great job.

621
00:26:32,071 --> 00:26:34,441
(Honey J showed a powerful energy and a unique aura.)

622
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:35,811
She's amazing.

623
00:26:35,941 --> 00:26:37,411
She had an amazing power.

624
00:26:37,841 --> 00:26:39,050
Applause to Rie Hata...

625
00:26:39,051 --> 00:26:43,250
for creating a choreography with so many peaks and valleys.

626
00:26:43,251 --> 00:26:45,290
So, again, respect to the choreography.

627
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:48,120
And it felt like you were connected to the music.

628
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:51,260
The moves became bigger because of that calmness.

629
00:26:51,261 --> 00:26:53,230
I liked such feelings too.

630
00:26:53,231 --> 00:26:54,390
(Rie Hata had perfect control...)

631
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:55,837
(and her connection to the music stood out.)

632
00:26:55,861 --> 00:26:57,660
I don't know. It's really hard.

633
00:26:57,661 --> 00:26:58,671
Yes.

634
00:26:58,871 --> 00:27:00,131
This is difficult.

635
00:27:01,131 --> 00:27:03,000
I really can't lose.

636
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:04,441
I have to get it.

637
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:08,211
I want to become the main dancer.

638
00:27:08,341 --> 00:27:11,311
I felt a strange anxiety that I'd never felt before.

639
00:27:12,551 --> 00:27:15,451
(Rie Hata went to the crew area before the result was announced.)

640
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:19,250
(Patting)

641
00:27:19,251 --> 00:27:20,891
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

642
00:27:23,021 --> 00:27:24,221
I showed them everything.

643
00:27:24,491 --> 00:27:26,431
It was the best.

644
00:27:27,531 --> 00:27:28,861
Goodness.

645
00:27:29,901 --> 00:27:33,001
I was so overwhelmed with emotions that tears came out.

646
00:27:34,771 --> 00:27:35,771
She's crying.

647
00:27:36,671 --> 00:27:38,101
- Who?
- Rie Hata.

648
00:27:38,941 --> 00:27:40,570
She has a weak mental strength.

649
00:27:40,571 --> 00:27:42,981
I don't want her to be under pressure.

650
00:27:44,381 --> 00:27:47,081
The main dancer of the leader class...

651
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:48,381
Please.

652
00:27:50,321 --> 00:27:51,321
It's Rie Hata.

653
00:27:51,821 --> 00:27:54,191
(The main dancer for the leader class is Rie Hata.)

654
00:27:56,161 --> 00:27:58,430
(She did it.)

655
00:27:58,431 --> 00:28:01,461
(We're so happy for her.)

656
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:04,661
(Honey J couldn't make it to the main dancer.)

657
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:05,831
It's okay.

658
00:28:06,671 --> 00:28:10,501
Why are you crying? Why? No.

659
00:28:11,071 --> 00:28:12,541
You did a great job.

660
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:17,841
- You did a great job, too.
- Don't cry. Yes, it's okay.

661
00:28:18,981 --> 00:28:21,181
What's the matter?

662
00:28:21,711 --> 00:28:23,451
Why do I want to cry?

663
00:28:23,721 --> 00:28:25,821
Well-deserved.

664
00:28:26,651 --> 00:28:28,661
I'd also cry if I were in her shoes.

665
00:28:29,991 --> 00:28:32,060
I felt pressured, so I was glad to win.

666
00:28:32,061 --> 00:28:33,931
So, I just couldn't stop crying.

667
00:28:35,701 --> 00:28:38,161
Thank you so much.

668
00:28:38,501 --> 00:28:40,931
With all the mixed feelings, I cried.

669
00:28:42,071 --> 00:28:46,311
I'll do my best to make all the dancers shine.

670
00:28:46,841 --> 00:28:48,271
Thank you so much.

671
00:28:49,341 --> 00:28:52,511
You're the best!

672
00:28:53,451 --> 00:28:54,731
Honey J, you did an amazing job.

673
00:28:54,851 --> 00:28:56,550
You looked awesome. Good job.

674
00:28:56,551 --> 00:28:57,551
I'm fine.

675
00:28:57,552 --> 00:28:59,450
I wanted to win so badly.

676
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:02,990
I had the opportunity to perform all the way to the end...

677
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,730
alongside the world-famous dancer whom I really admire.

678
00:29:05,731 --> 00:29:06,761
I'm so proud of myself.

679
00:29:06,891 --> 00:29:09,831
But it feels just like deja vu.

680
00:29:10,231 --> 00:29:12,570
In Season One, I lost every mission...

681
00:29:12,571 --> 00:29:14,071
whenever I made it to the final.

682
00:29:14,901 --> 00:29:16,341
It was so disappointing.

683
00:29:17,641 --> 00:29:19,011
Congratulations.

684
00:29:19,211 --> 00:29:20,241
Thanks.

685
00:29:21,611 --> 00:29:23,381
It's tough.

686
00:29:24,141 --> 00:29:26,251
You're awesome.

687
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:29,320
Since it wasn't an easy win,

688
00:29:29,321 --> 00:29:30,651
I took it very gratefully.

689
00:29:31,181 --> 00:29:35,051
Now that I'm the main dancer for the leader class's music video,

690
00:29:35,261 --> 00:29:37,920
I'll make something that all the dancers feel like...

691
00:29:37,921 --> 00:29:39,161
they're the main dancers.

692
00:29:40,331 --> 00:29:45,061
(The following day after the Main Dancer Audition)

693
00:29:46,431 --> 00:29:47,730
(6 crews are back in the fight club.)

694
00:29:47,731 --> 00:29:50,241
- Good morning.
- Hi.

695
00:29:52,571 --> 00:29:54,711
(Everyone arrived at Crew Agit.)

696
00:29:54,971 --> 00:29:58,550
Aaliyah and Vanessa. So, congratulations, ladies.

697
00:29:58,551 --> 00:30:01,150
You guys made AG SQUAD proud.

698
00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:02,820
Extra 100 points.

699
00:30:02,821 --> 00:30:04,221
That's crazy.

700
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:06,890
So, how would you pick your worst dancer...

701
00:30:06,891 --> 00:30:09,361
with the freedom of power you have?

702
00:30:09,491 --> 00:30:13,391
It has definitely...

703
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:16,100
a lot to do with attitude.

704
00:30:16,101 --> 00:30:18,570
But we're not going to mention that to them.

705
00:30:18,571 --> 00:30:20,901
So, it may give us an easier choice.

706
00:30:21,901 --> 00:30:26,271
If you guys had to choose a crew...

707
00:30:26,311 --> 00:30:29,210
RHTokyo or AG SQUAD?

708
00:30:29,211 --> 00:30:32,050
So, it's us, AG SQUAD, and RHTokyo.

709
00:30:32,051 --> 00:30:34,310
- We're the main dancers.
- Yes, main dancers.

710
00:30:34,311 --> 00:30:35,350
We all have 100 points.

711
00:30:35,351 --> 00:30:37,820
- Just give them both.
- Yes.

712
00:30:37,821 --> 00:30:39,720
I'm going to watch...

713
00:30:39,721 --> 00:30:42,060
how hard they work during the practice.

714
00:30:42,061 --> 00:30:43,860
For example, answering loudly.

715
00:30:43,861 --> 00:30:45,330
(Like this)

716
00:30:45,331 --> 00:30:47,690
Or leaving quickly after practice without lingering.

717
00:30:47,691 --> 00:30:49,630
Leaving right away.

718
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:52,101
That's Japanese etiquette. You know that.

719
00:30:52,171 --> 00:30:53,630
Make a good impression.

720
00:30:53,631 --> 00:30:54,871
At this point,

721
00:30:55,171 --> 00:30:56,970
let's just fully cooperate with the main dancers.

722
00:30:56,971 --> 00:30:58,840
You could be an assistant or their right-hand man.

723
00:30:58,841 --> 00:31:00,170
To avoid being chosen as the worst dancers,

724
00:31:00,171 --> 00:31:01,871
get along with the main dancers.

725
00:31:01,941 --> 00:31:03,210
Keep that in mind.

726
00:31:03,211 --> 00:31:04,940
The worst dancer loses 50 points.

727
00:31:04,941 --> 00:31:06,750
Our next goal is...

728
00:31:06,751 --> 00:31:09,220
not to be chosen as the worst dancers.

729
00:31:09,221 --> 00:31:10,381
(Of course)

730
00:31:10,951 --> 00:31:12,151
What is this? Hold on.

731
00:31:14,621 --> 00:31:15,790
Director's cut.

732
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,491
(Director's cut?)

733
00:31:17,761 --> 00:31:19,660
The audio files for each class's dance video...

734
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:22,031
include the "Director's cut" part.

735
00:31:22,261 --> 00:31:24,200
The main dancers will choreograph...

736
00:31:24,201 --> 00:31:25,930
"Director's cut" part.

737
00:31:25,931 --> 00:31:29,240
The one and only crew picked by the main dancers...

738
00:31:29,241 --> 00:31:31,741
will be featured in the "Director's cut."

739
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:33,770
(The main dancers and the directors who will select "Director's cut")

740
00:31:33,771 --> 00:31:35,780
(Rie Hata, Harmz, Isla, Zari, Moana, Vanessa, Aaliyah)

741
00:31:35,781 --> 00:31:37,280
Four of us could be featured.

742
00:31:37,281 --> 00:31:39,980
- Or you two could be featured.
- That's right.

743
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,250
So, they're going to go through each video and say...

744
00:31:42,251 --> 00:31:43,820
"They did it the best. Put them in it."

745
00:31:43,821 --> 00:31:45,950
It means five crews will compete.

746
00:31:45,951 --> 00:31:48,551
We should be picked for the "Director's cut."

747
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:50,361
What? Is there more?

748
00:31:50,621 --> 00:31:52,730
In the final dance video,

749
00:31:52,731 --> 00:31:56,001
check the one crew the director chose.

750
00:31:56,261 --> 00:31:58,460
- I see.
- So, it'll be edited out...

751
00:31:58,461 --> 00:31:59,930
after we all shoot it.

752
00:31:59,931 --> 00:32:01,370
The one that is selected...

753
00:32:01,371 --> 00:32:03,570
would be unlikely to be the worst dancer.

754
00:32:03,571 --> 00:32:04,840
Let's do our best.

755
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:06,410
I'm so confident.

756
00:32:06,411 --> 00:32:08,410
I should feel more than confident being on camera.

757
00:32:08,411 --> 00:32:11,011
I thought I could get this.

758
00:32:11,141 --> 00:32:13,051
Yes, it's going to be me.

759
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:14,781
It's going to be me.

760
00:32:14,911 --> 00:32:17,980
I'm confident that I can take the Director's cut.

761
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:20,850
I definitely know I'm not going to be the worst dancer.

762
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:22,860
We won't know until the dance video is out.

763
00:32:22,861 --> 00:32:24,360
This is really something.

764
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:26,090
There will be no point in doing it if we can't take this part.

765
00:32:26,091 --> 00:32:28,901
If you're chosen, will you be safe from being the worst dancer?

766
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:31,900
I think it could set the standard.

767
00:32:31,901 --> 00:32:35,000
You need to perform that part really well,

768
00:32:35,001 --> 00:32:36,970
not to look like a backup dancer.

769
00:32:36,971 --> 00:32:38,970
Pick us. Let us take it.

770
00:32:38,971 --> 00:32:40,340
(Give it to us.)

771
00:32:40,341 --> 00:32:41,970
For the middle class, you're probably...

772
00:32:41,971 --> 00:32:44,240
the most capable of doing the ROYAL FAMILY's choreography.

773
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:46,410
We're not going to know because they'll pick it.

774
00:32:46,411 --> 00:32:49,720
You can get it. You guys can easily do the ROYAL FAMILY stuff.

775
00:32:49,721 --> 00:32:50,850
We're just going to do it.

776
00:32:50,851 --> 00:32:52,490
- We're just going to do us.
- So, we're, once again,

777
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:54,090
just trying to make something...

778
00:32:54,091 --> 00:32:57,760
that highlights AG SQUAD for who we are as Team Australia.

779
00:32:57,761 --> 00:33:02,601
I'm very confident in us being picked for this little part.

780
00:33:03,261 --> 00:33:04,400
They might go like,

781
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:06,670
"Of course, AG SQUAD is going to get picked for the Director's cut."

782
00:33:06,671 --> 00:33:09,040
- No, I'm going to make it fair.
- Yes.

783
00:33:09,041 --> 00:33:11,841
So, it's up to them ultimately. Who wants it more?

784
00:33:12,001 --> 00:33:15,071
I wonder who it will be.

785
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:17,981
(Knocking)

786
00:33:19,211 --> 00:33:20,550
- Everyone.
- Yes.

787
00:33:20,551 --> 00:33:23,280
I brought someone who will help our team.

788
00:33:23,281 --> 00:33:25,920
My partner, Hyojin Choi, needs...

789
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:29,321
to work on the choreography of the middle class.

790
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:30,890
Hyeily!

791
00:33:30,891 --> 00:33:33,890
So, Hyeily and I will shoot...

792
00:33:33,891 --> 00:33:36,831
the dance video for the rookie class.

793
00:33:37,101 --> 00:33:39,230
(Joining the rookie class for Team Korea)

794
00:33:39,231 --> 00:33:41,971
(Hyeily, the main dancer from Season 1 for the assist class)

795
00:33:42,101 --> 00:33:43,441
I'm looking forward to it.

796
00:33:43,671 --> 00:33:45,670
I'm so glad you came. Thank you.

797
00:33:45,671 --> 00:33:47,911
- Thanks.
- Thank you

798
00:33:51,481 --> 00:33:53,480
(Middle-class dancers gathered for the first time to practice.)

799
00:33:53,481 --> 00:33:57,750
Each crew stayed together. The mood was quite serious.

800
00:33:57,751 --> 00:33:59,420
We all keep each other in check.

801
00:33:59,421 --> 00:34:02,360
- No, you can't be friends.
- Hi.

802
00:34:02,361 --> 00:34:04,890
No, you can't be friends with them.

803
00:34:04,891 --> 00:34:08,090
It seemed that everyone came with a competitive spirit...

804
00:34:08,091 --> 00:34:09,461
in their hearts.

805
00:34:09,601 --> 00:34:10,861
This is everybody, right?

806
00:34:11,531 --> 00:34:12,770
Except for ROYAL FAMILY?

807
00:34:12,771 --> 00:34:14,431
Hi, everyone.

808
00:34:14,631 --> 00:34:17,041
(ROYAL FAMILY, the director crew, finally came.)

809
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:18,717
Give them a round of applause.

810
00:34:18,741 --> 00:34:21,010
Everyone seemed to do their best...

811
00:34:21,011 --> 00:34:22,641
to respond actively.

812
00:34:23,381 --> 00:34:25,510
Do we have to sit separately for the Director's cut?

813
00:34:25,511 --> 00:34:26,911
- Yes.
- Yes.

814
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:29,181
- Lovely.
- Really?

815
00:34:29,321 --> 00:34:30,651
Cool.

816
00:34:30,851 --> 00:34:32,080
She said she loved that.

817
00:34:32,081 --> 00:34:33,450
(Glancing)

818
00:34:33,451 --> 00:34:35,920
So, we'll just explain everything.

819
00:34:35,921 --> 00:34:39,390
We'll talk about the set, the vibe,

820
00:34:39,391 --> 00:34:42,631
how we're going to split everyone up, and stuff like that.

821
00:34:42,661 --> 00:34:45,300
(Main dancers from each class had a directors' meeting.)

822
00:34:45,301 --> 00:34:48,370
We've got lots of exciting ideas.

823
00:34:48,371 --> 00:34:51,441
Little surprises we had planned.

824
00:34:51,601 --> 00:34:54,271
Our video is going to be a movie.

825
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:58,080
So, for the Director's cut part,

826
00:34:58,081 --> 00:34:59,880
we've choreographed eight counts,

827
00:34:59,881 --> 00:35:02,180
and then we left the 2nd 8 count blank.

828
00:35:02,181 --> 00:35:05,650
Come together in your team and finish it how you want to.

829
00:35:05,651 --> 00:35:08,067
Eight counts are choreographed, and another eight are freestyle.

830
00:35:08,091 --> 00:35:09,960
The Director's cut has 2 8-counts.

831
00:35:09,961 --> 00:35:12,930
The 1st 8 count is a set choreography they gave us.

832
00:35:12,931 --> 00:35:15,630
And the 2nd 8 count is totally freestyle,

833
00:35:15,631 --> 00:35:18,161
depending on what each crew wants to make out of it.

834
00:35:18,231 --> 00:35:20,600
(Checking the Director's cut part)

835
00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:24,270
(The 1st 8 count)

836
00:35:24,271 --> 00:35:27,110
(The 2nd 8 count)

837
00:35:27,111 --> 00:35:29,810
I just like to give something to MOTIV.

838
00:35:29,811 --> 00:35:30,940
That's always the goal.

839
00:35:30,941 --> 00:35:32,080
I'm pretty confident...

840
00:35:32,081 --> 00:35:34,410
because our ideas and creativity...

841
00:35:34,411 --> 00:35:36,350
are much higher than those of the other groups.

842
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:38,480
I think this is a big opportunity...

843
00:35:38,481 --> 00:35:40,691
to show who we are,

844
00:35:40,791 --> 00:35:42,890
so I really want to take the Director's cut.

845
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,390
I think we haven't shown...

846
00:35:44,391 --> 00:35:47,390
much of anything impressive so far.

847
00:35:47,391 --> 00:35:51,331
I really wanted to take this part.

848
00:35:54,201 --> 00:35:56,770
So, we're about to get started with our choreography.

849
00:35:56,771 --> 00:36:00,310
The concepts were focused around me and Aaliyah.

850
00:36:00,311 --> 00:36:04,380
We have the two main parts that highlight the two of us.

851
00:36:04,381 --> 00:36:07,150
Vanessa's long hair and nails.

852
00:36:07,151 --> 00:36:09,780
My short hair and big eyes.

853
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:12,990
Some parts don't even involve me or Aaliyah.

854
00:36:12,991 --> 00:36:16,390
But the objects are kind of related to us.

855
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:18,120
The point of view is Vanessa's hair.

856
00:36:18,121 --> 00:36:19,830
So, Vanessa's hair is going to be...

857
00:36:19,831 --> 00:36:22,660
I'm super excited again for Vanessa and me...

858
00:36:22,661 --> 00:36:24,860
to showcase what we do.

859
00:36:24,861 --> 00:36:27,430
It's quite easy and something that comes naturally to me.

860
00:36:27,431 --> 00:36:28,470
And I love it.

861
00:36:28,471 --> 00:36:31,840
(The rookie class started their practice.)

862
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:34,070
And five, six, and...

863
00:36:34,071 --> 00:36:35,981
(Watching carefully)

864
00:36:36,281 --> 00:36:38,440
Since there were many details, I thought...

865
00:36:38,441 --> 00:36:41,881
it might be a challenge to remember the choreography.

866
00:36:42,281 --> 00:36:45,521
I've never shaken my hips that much.

867
00:36:45,991 --> 00:36:48,791
I've never shaken my hips that much in my life.

868
00:36:48,961 --> 00:36:50,521
I haven't used my hips for a long time.

869
00:36:51,561 --> 00:36:53,361
Inside of me,

870
00:36:53,591 --> 00:36:56,131
Hot J instead of Lip J.

871
00:36:56,561 --> 00:36:58,801
I need to awaken Hot J.

872
00:36:59,001 --> 00:37:00,431
I should awaken Hot J sooner.

873
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:05,100
AG SQUAD's choreography was sexy.

874
00:37:05,101 --> 00:37:07,870
But that's different from my main genre.

875
00:37:07,871 --> 00:37:10,080
So, to be honest, I was worried...

876
00:37:10,081 --> 00:37:11,641
and anxious.

877
00:37:11,741 --> 00:37:15,080
We're very similar in style. You know, it's AG SQUAD.

878
00:37:15,081 --> 00:37:18,080
I do feel quite confident and comfortable.

879
00:37:18,081 --> 00:37:19,420
- It feels more comfortable now.
- Yes.

880
00:37:19,421 --> 00:37:23,590
ROYAL FAMILY was impressive and doing really well.

881
00:37:23,591 --> 00:37:26,191
I could see others dancing in the mirrors.

882
00:37:26,391 --> 00:37:28,091
It bothered me.

883
00:37:28,461 --> 00:37:30,760
(Maiya and Kylie came back to Crew Agit after practice.)

884
00:37:30,761 --> 00:37:34,300
I think MOTIV might struggle with the choreographies...

885
00:37:34,301 --> 00:37:36,640
only because they're not used to it.

886
00:37:36,641 --> 00:37:37,770
(She saw something.)

887
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:39,940
Worst dancer nominee after the first rehearsal.

888
00:37:39,941 --> 00:37:43,781
- The worst dancer?
- Nominee after the first rehearsal.

889
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,141
What?

890
00:37:45,411 --> 00:37:47,110
Are they saying we're the worst?

891
00:37:47,111 --> 00:37:48,710
No, that is crazy.

892
00:37:48,711 --> 00:37:51,980
I just don't think that their feedback was valid.

893
00:37:51,981 --> 00:37:54,690
So I was feeling very ripped off and betrayed.

894
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:57,191
We were thinking about attitude.

895
00:37:57,361 --> 00:38:02,431
I think it's just maybe slipped up on professionalism a little bit.

896
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:05,101
We directed them to work on their...

897
00:38:05,461 --> 00:38:08,101
Instead of the director's cut, they were doing...

898
00:38:08,431 --> 00:38:09,471
TikToks.

899
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:12,670
When a choreographer directs you to...

900
00:38:12,671 --> 00:38:15,610
do a specific task, it's very important...

901
00:38:15,611 --> 00:38:17,811
that you continue to do that specific task.

902
00:38:19,251 --> 00:38:20,351
It's so funny.

903
00:38:21,381 --> 00:38:24,221
They're doing TikToks.

904
00:38:25,551 --> 00:38:27,091
- It's so funny.
- ROYAL FAMILY.

905
00:38:28,321 --> 00:38:31,991
So when I noticed they were doing TikToks...

906
00:38:32,731 --> 00:38:33,731
And this one.

907
00:38:33,731 --> 00:38:34,731
(Excited)

908
00:38:35,061 --> 00:38:37,260
I'm watching.

909
00:38:37,261 --> 00:38:39,400
And right now, I don't like that. Doing TikToks.

910
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:40,401
Yes.

911
00:38:40,431 --> 00:38:42,131
It just shows us that they were...

912
00:38:42,231 --> 00:38:44,501
mentally not present.

913
00:38:45,001 --> 00:38:48,541
Regardless of how we act during training,

914
00:38:49,241 --> 00:38:53,111
it all really does come down to how you perform.

915
00:38:55,351 --> 00:38:56,720
I know that we'll be able to...

916
00:38:56,721 --> 00:38:58,081
- kill it.
- This is so funny.

917
00:38:59,351 --> 00:39:00,791
Holy...

918
00:39:00,991 --> 00:39:03,260
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's Agit)

919
00:39:03,261 --> 00:39:04,920
- Wait.
- What?

920
00:39:04,921 --> 00:39:06,260
There's a piece of paper.

921
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,361
What is it?

922
00:39:07,891 --> 00:39:09,431
What? The worst dancer nominee?

923
00:39:10,761 --> 00:39:12,721
"Worst dancer nominee after the first rehearsal."

924
00:39:12,771 --> 00:39:15,611
"Please do your best to avoid being titled the worst dancer. Let's go."

925
00:39:16,441 --> 00:39:18,941
Wait. Is it saying that we're the nominees?

926
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:22,480
(Silence)

927
00:39:22,481 --> 00:39:25,041
The worst dancer nominee. Us?

928
00:39:25,581 --> 00:39:29,551
That's nonsense.

929
00:39:29,751 --> 00:39:32,650
I think there were some dancers that didn't match...

930
00:39:32,651 --> 00:39:34,450
ROYAL FAMILY's style of dance.

931
00:39:34,451 --> 00:39:36,321
(During the middle class practice)

932
00:39:37,591 --> 00:39:39,491
(Tilting)

933
00:39:40,591 --> 00:39:42,061
(Tilting)

934
00:39:43,001 --> 00:39:45,561
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's middle class struggled with the choreography.)

935
00:39:45,871 --> 00:39:47,530
(Watching carefully)

936
00:39:47,531 --> 00:39:50,941
I knew how well she danced prior to coming onto the show.

937
00:39:51,241 --> 00:39:52,301
But it's different.

938
00:39:53,371 --> 00:39:57,911
Little bit less strong compared to her fellow teammates.

939
00:39:58,011 --> 00:40:00,311
In terms of the choreography,

940
00:40:00,411 --> 00:40:04,681
they might think we're less powerful.

941
00:40:05,221 --> 00:40:06,691
That makes sense.

942
00:40:06,991 --> 00:40:10,091
I was expecting it, but it's never nice to receive it.

943
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:11,621
That we're the worst.

944
00:40:12,421 --> 00:40:13,890
After receiving the worst dancer nominee,

945
00:40:13,891 --> 00:40:16,060
I thought I should be more enthusiastic...

946
00:40:16,061 --> 00:40:19,670
to escape from that impression.

947
00:40:19,671 --> 00:40:22,540
It's dangerous to be the worst dancer,

948
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:25,401
and I want to avoid that no matter what.

949
00:40:25,501 --> 00:40:28,111
I decided to try harder.

950
00:40:28,671 --> 00:40:30,911
It's cold. Hello.

951
00:40:31,611 --> 00:40:33,510
This is Americano for you.

952
00:40:33,511 --> 00:40:36,021
- Thank you.
- Of course.

953
00:40:36,121 --> 00:40:37,550
Milk for Ibuki.

954
00:40:37,551 --> 00:40:38,850
Thank you.

955
00:40:38,851 --> 00:40:41,691
I forgot if you said iced or hot.

956
00:40:41,991 --> 00:40:42,991
Hot.

957
00:40:42,992 --> 00:40:44,590
She got us coffee this morning.

958
00:40:44,591 --> 00:40:47,191
She was very kind to all of us.

959
00:40:47,631 --> 00:40:48,631
Director.

960
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:51,861
Hello.

961
00:40:52,161 --> 00:40:55,941
This is so dope. Amazing.

962
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:59,670
No matter how big the stage was,

963
00:40:59,671 --> 00:41:01,871
we dancers were artists' backup dancers,

964
00:41:01,971 --> 00:41:05,180
or we put on makeup on our own.

965
00:41:05,181 --> 00:41:07,781
We only had that experience for many years.

966
00:41:07,881 --> 00:41:12,480
And there was a makeup table for all of us.

967
00:41:12,481 --> 00:41:14,520
I realized that we were making a dance video...

968
00:41:14,521 --> 00:41:16,521
with the dancers in the center.

969
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:17,921
I was touched.

970
00:41:18,821 --> 00:41:20,191
(Startled)

971
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:24,431
(A separate green room for the main director)

972
00:41:24,561 --> 00:41:26,071
What brings you here today?

973
00:41:26,631 --> 00:41:28,301
I am the main director.

974
00:41:29,271 --> 00:41:34,111
There was a director's room just for me.

975
00:41:34,211 --> 00:41:37,511
It felt like a special treatment.

976
00:41:37,611 --> 00:41:39,040
- Hello.
- Hi.

977
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:40,411
(Here comes the director.)

978
00:41:40,551 --> 00:41:42,581
Thank you for waiting.

979
00:41:42,681 --> 00:41:45,081
- Nice. You look cool.
- Is it nice?

980
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:47,190
(Ibuki shows an extreme reaction toward Rie Hata's tooth gems.)

981
00:41:47,191 --> 00:41:49,711
(Ibuki shows an extreme reaction toward Rie Hata's tooth gems.)

982
00:41:50,191 --> 00:41:54,131
(The leader class dance video shoot begins.)

983
00:41:54,231 --> 00:41:55,391
(Monitoring)

984
00:41:55,491 --> 00:41:57,331
(Ibuki's right next to Rie Hata.)

985
00:41:57,461 --> 00:41:59,571
- I look too sharp, don't I?
- No, it's awesome.

986
00:42:00,031 --> 00:42:01,571
- Awesome?
- Awesome.

987
00:42:02,231 --> 00:42:04,071
Rie Hata was my teacher.

988
00:42:04,171 --> 00:42:06,071
And I was her student.

989
00:42:06,171 --> 00:42:07,910
What matters the most is...

990
00:42:07,911 --> 00:42:09,641
to listen to what Rie Hata says.

991
00:42:09,741 --> 00:42:12,181
To avoid becoming the worst dancer.

992
00:42:12,751 --> 00:42:13,810
We had a history...

993
00:42:13,811 --> 00:42:16,881
as OSAKA Ojo Gang versus RHTokyo.

994
00:42:17,221 --> 00:42:19,291
But from now on, I'll listen to what she says.

995
00:42:19,391 --> 00:42:20,891
I'll be a good student.

996
00:42:20,991 --> 00:42:22,721
My service to you.

997
00:42:23,961 --> 00:42:26,491
(The rookie class dance video set)

998
00:42:28,691 --> 00:42:30,330
So cute.

999
00:42:30,331 --> 00:42:32,060
(Rookies, welcome.)

1000
00:42:32,061 --> 00:42:34,130
As you can tell right now, we're all getting ready.

1001
00:42:34,131 --> 00:42:36,500
It will finally come to life with...

1002
00:42:36,501 --> 00:42:38,970
all the hair, all the makeup, and the location.

1003
00:42:38,971 --> 00:42:39,971
I can't wait.

1004
00:42:39,972 --> 00:42:42,941
Today, I'm not Lip J. I'm going to be Hot J.

1005
00:42:43,541 --> 00:42:45,510
Okay. Here we go.

1006
00:42:45,511 --> 00:42:47,050
(Eyes focused)

1007
00:42:47,051 --> 00:42:49,081
We love the location. It looks great.

1008
00:42:49,181 --> 00:42:50,751
Oh, it's so gorgeous.

1009
00:42:52,121 --> 00:42:55,150
Uwa, you just have to swipe this way.

1010
00:42:55,151 --> 00:42:56,160
Okay.

1011
00:42:56,161 --> 00:42:57,161
(Uwa reflects Vanessa's feedback immediately.)

1012
00:42:57,162 --> 00:43:00,830
Avoiding the worst dancer title is my highest priority.

1013
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:02,131
I'm going to do my best.

1014
00:43:02,231 --> 00:43:03,630
You want to see our photos?

1015
00:43:03,631 --> 00:43:04,791
(Kylie shows off the photos.)

1016
00:43:05,031 --> 00:43:06,471
Don't play with the duo.

1017
00:43:06,571 --> 00:43:08,271
No, I'm not nervous.

1018
00:43:08,371 --> 00:43:10,801
We did feel really confident going in there.

1019
00:43:11,141 --> 00:43:12,811
Look at me. Oh, my gosh.

1020
00:43:12,911 --> 00:43:16,141
That's how cold I was. Look. I'm trying to...

1021
00:43:17,781 --> 00:43:19,310
Sorry. TikTok time.

1022
00:43:19,311 --> 00:43:20,551
We'll begin now.

1023
00:43:21,111 --> 00:43:23,921
(ROYAL FAMILY won't put down their phones.)

1024
00:43:26,151 --> 00:43:30,060
For ROYAL FAMILY, they could lose focus sometimes.

1025
00:43:30,061 --> 00:43:32,661
Girls, you know what to do. Just give it all.

1026
00:43:32,761 --> 00:43:34,831
Can I have some lotion, please?

1027
00:43:35,691 --> 00:43:37,501
I think she can't understand.

1028
00:43:38,231 --> 00:43:39,231
(Laughing)

1029
00:43:39,401 --> 00:43:41,601
- Lotion.
- Guys.

1030
00:43:41,871 --> 00:43:45,371
Go full out, please. Just so then the camera can...

1031
00:43:45,671 --> 00:43:47,570
Just want to see it for the angle-wise.

1032
00:43:47,571 --> 00:43:50,481
It seems like they didn't understand what we were trying to do.

1033
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:51,840
Let's go.

1034
00:43:51,841 --> 00:43:53,001
(The directors are focusing.)

1035
00:43:56,581 --> 00:43:58,061
(Kylie ended up falling in her part.)

1036
00:43:59,521 --> 00:44:00,691
- You're good.
- It's okay.

1037
00:44:00,991 --> 00:44:03,790
My fall could've affected the worst dancer,

1038
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:05,361
which is okay because it's a fall.

1039
00:44:05,621 --> 00:44:06,691
Sorry, queens.

1040
00:44:08,761 --> 00:44:11,101
Where is it? Is it the tent?

1041
00:44:11,731 --> 00:44:12,900
(The middle class dancers head to the green room.)

1042
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:14,370
We have to go to the backup dancer zone.

1043
00:44:14,371 --> 00:44:17,540
The main director zone and the backup dancer zone.

1044
00:44:17,541 --> 00:44:19,540
- Can I see?
- The main dancer...

1045
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:20,610
What's the difference?

1046
00:44:20,611 --> 00:44:23,541
It's in the crew's color.

1047
00:44:24,611 --> 00:44:26,451
This was supposed to be my spot.

1048
00:44:26,551 --> 00:44:28,087
Are we not even allowed to talk to the director?

1049
00:44:28,111 --> 00:44:32,751
The main dancers' room was really nice.

1050
00:44:32,851 --> 00:44:34,851
It was very different.

1051
00:44:35,091 --> 00:44:37,890
(The directors head to the horseback riding track.)

1052
00:44:37,891 --> 00:44:39,560
We're going to be on horses today.

1053
00:44:39,561 --> 00:44:40,761
I know. What the heck?

1054
00:44:41,131 --> 00:44:43,261
There will be real live horses.

1055
00:44:44,601 --> 00:44:45,901
- Cool.
- I know.

1056
00:44:46,401 --> 00:44:47,830
Coming on the show, I never thought,

1057
00:44:47,831 --> 00:44:49,770
"I'm going to be riding a horse when I'm over there."

1058
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:50,940
Not going to be...

1059
00:44:50,941 --> 00:44:53,411
(4 mysterious men appear from the other side.)

1060
00:44:53,911 --> 00:44:56,340
Five male dancers.

1061
00:44:56,341 --> 00:44:59,011
Oh, my gosh. Yes.

1062
00:44:59,111 --> 00:45:01,811
Shirtless. Leather pants.

1063
00:45:02,481 --> 00:45:04,050
Oh, my gosh. This is going to be like...

1064
00:45:04,051 --> 00:45:06,151
- This is crazy.
- So good.

1065
00:45:06,821 --> 00:45:08,821
(The male dancers are right behind them.)

1066
00:45:09,321 --> 00:45:12,291
- Oh, the helpers.
- Hey.

1067
00:45:13,831 --> 00:45:15,991
- Nice to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you. Isla.

1068
00:45:16,461 --> 00:45:18,961
I'm not going to lie. They were all pretty good-looking.

1069
00:45:19,771 --> 00:45:20,771
Nice.

1070
00:45:20,771 --> 00:45:21,771
(Laughing)

1071
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:24,661
(They left strong impression on "Street Man Fighter.")

1072
00:45:24,771 --> 00:45:27,411
(The krump dancer KNUCKS of PRIME KINGZ)

1073
00:45:29,111 --> 00:45:31,411
(RKLS of BANK TWO BROTHERS from "Street Man Fighter")

1074
00:45:31,511 --> 00:45:33,310
(Dancer BOLT)

1075
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:35,451
(Dancer FEELIN')

1076
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:37,651
Who are these boys?

1077
00:45:38,251 --> 00:45:40,621
Thank you for joining us today.

1078
00:45:40,721 --> 00:45:42,250
(They can't stop laughing.)

1079
00:45:42,251 --> 00:45:44,091
That was way more fun than it should've been.

1080
00:45:45,421 --> 00:45:47,531
It always feels exciting, you know?

1081
00:45:47,761 --> 00:45:50,661
It will create a good reaction from whoever views...

1082
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:52,001
our video to...

1083
00:45:52,301 --> 00:45:54,871
Ready, Lommel? You're going to be a movie star.

1084
00:45:55,631 --> 00:45:58,341
(The directors appear on horses.)

1085
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:00,571
- They're shirtless?
- Sick.

1086
00:46:01,271 --> 00:46:02,340
They look so great.

1087
00:46:02,341 --> 00:46:04,910
When we first walked in, ROYAL FAMILY was...

1088
00:46:04,911 --> 00:46:06,950
already on top of the horses.

1089
00:46:06,951 --> 00:46:10,281
That was like, "That would've been really cool to do."

1090
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,480
What the?

1091
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:14,321
It's the director's chair.

1092
00:46:14,891 --> 00:46:16,321
- Did you have one too?
- Yes.

1093
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:19,361
(I used to give orders.)

1094
00:46:19,491 --> 00:46:20,690
(But now, I'm a backup dancer.)

1095
00:46:20,691 --> 00:46:22,361
We're not even allowed to watch?

1096
00:46:22,461 --> 00:46:23,701
How can you do this to us?

1097
00:46:24,001 --> 00:46:26,571
Put more space in between, so we can watch between them.

1098
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,071
Shame, losers.

1099
00:46:29,131 --> 00:46:30,141
(Tease-ya)

1100
00:46:30,341 --> 00:46:31,600
- Unbelievable.
- The senior.

1101
00:46:31,601 --> 00:46:33,170
Hey, pay attention.

1102
00:46:33,171 --> 00:46:34,811
- Pay attention.
- Sorry.

1103
00:46:34,911 --> 00:46:36,880
- Be obedient.
- Make sure to answer her.

1104
00:46:36,881 --> 00:46:39,211
I didn't want to become the worst dancer.

1105
00:46:39,311 --> 00:46:41,611
I shouldn't do anything to get on her nerves.

1106
00:46:42,411 --> 00:46:43,751
Let's kill this, okay?

1107
00:46:44,151 --> 00:46:46,121
Girls, just arms on this one.

1108
00:46:46,451 --> 00:46:49,221
Make sure... In line with your shoulder.

1109
00:46:49,521 --> 00:46:52,421
So, not like this. Not too high. Just nice and straight.

1110
00:46:52,961 --> 00:46:55,390
There's still a possibility of becoming the worst dancer.

1111
00:46:55,391 --> 00:46:57,901
So I want to do my best to the end...

1112
00:46:58,161 --> 00:46:59,601
with a positive attitude.

1113
00:47:01,831 --> 00:47:04,371
Australia, tiniest bit out. A little bit.

1114
00:47:05,341 --> 00:47:07,540
They were taking it as if we were the back dancers.

1115
00:47:07,541 --> 00:47:10,781
Australia. Spread out a little more.

1116
00:47:12,011 --> 00:47:13,581
Hey, they're trying to play the game.

1117
00:47:14,151 --> 00:47:15,481
It is what it is.

1118
00:47:16,221 --> 00:47:18,081
(Filming the dance with male dancers)

1119
00:47:20,291 --> 00:47:21,991
(Let me see.)

1120
00:47:22,421 --> 00:47:24,091
Oh, my goodness. KNUCKS.

1121
00:47:24,191 --> 00:47:25,821
(Shocked)

1122
00:47:26,431 --> 00:47:28,230
Ri.hey, close your eyes.

1123
00:47:28,231 --> 00:47:29,760
Does Ri.hey know about this?

1124
00:47:29,761 --> 00:47:32,000
- Of course not. How would she know?
- Oh, my gosh.

1125
00:47:32,001 --> 00:47:35,171
(KNUCKS and Ri.hey are a famous dancer couple.)

1126
00:47:35,271 --> 00:47:36,671
(Serious)

1127
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:40,311
I have a role of a spy.

1128
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:42,151
I'm sending it to her now.

1129
00:47:43,141 --> 00:47:45,010
- Isla, you know what?
- They should've done it.

1130
00:47:45,011 --> 00:47:47,281
- My teammate, Ri.hey's boyfriend.
- Did you see that?

1131
00:47:47,381 --> 00:47:49,150
(Exclaiming)

1132
00:47:49,151 --> 00:47:51,321
I hope she's not going to be mad at me.

1133
00:47:51,981 --> 00:47:53,467
(The undercover agent is reporting live from the scene.)

1134
00:47:53,491 --> 00:47:55,651
Ri.hey, they're taking your man.

1135
00:48:00,691 --> 00:48:02,561
(Screaming)

1136
00:48:04,601 --> 00:48:06,270
I was just looking at them. At the boys.

1137
00:48:06,271 --> 00:48:07,470
Is that...

1138
00:48:07,471 --> 00:48:08,800
I wish that would have been me.

1139
00:48:08,801 --> 00:48:09,901
Gosh.

1140
00:48:11,371 --> 00:48:13,740
They all looked good. They all looked nice.

1141
00:48:13,741 --> 00:48:15,670
But the one that was with Zari... I was like,

1142
00:48:15,671 --> 00:48:16,741
"What's your number?"

1143
00:48:17,441 --> 00:48:18,441
(Laughing)

1144
00:48:18,442 --> 00:48:23,281
(Results day of the Class Mission)

1145
00:48:31,691 --> 00:48:32,890
Class Mission results.

1146
00:48:32,891 --> 00:48:34,131
So intense.

1147
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:36,160
Scary.

1148
00:48:36,161 --> 00:48:38,331
Gosh, I'm sweating.

1149
00:48:38,861 --> 00:48:40,770
I have goosebumps. I'm so excited.

1150
00:48:40,771 --> 00:48:42,731
Gosh, I'm so nervous.

1151
00:48:43,101 --> 00:48:44,901
(Here comes the host.)

1152
00:48:47,211 --> 00:48:50,240
(Clapping and cheering)

1153
00:48:50,241 --> 00:48:52,211
It feels real when he comes in.

1154
00:48:52,481 --> 00:48:54,680
A pride-fueled global dance battle between the fiercest women...

1155
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:56,080
from around the world.

1156
00:48:56,081 --> 00:48:59,151
World of Street Woman Fighter. I'm the host, Sung Han Bin.

1157
00:48:59,521 --> 00:49:02,990
The pride of each crew is at stake in this Class Mission evaluation.

1158
00:49:02,991 --> 00:49:05,491
The main dancer will receive 100 bonus points,

1159
00:49:05,891 --> 00:49:08,930
while the worst dancer will receive 50 penalty points.

1160
00:49:08,931 --> 00:49:11,761
And these scores will affect the final crew rankings.

1161
00:49:12,131 --> 00:49:14,330
The main dancers of each class acted as the director.

1162
00:49:14,331 --> 00:49:17,601
In the leader class, Rie Hata of RHTokyo.

1163
00:49:17,801 --> 00:49:22,641
In the middle class, Isla, Moana, Harmz, Zari of ROYAL FAMILY.

1164
00:49:22,911 --> 00:49:27,080
In the rookie class, Aaliyah and Vanessa of AG SQUAD.

1165
00:49:27,081 --> 00:49:29,280
These dancers were given the ultimate power...

1166
00:49:29,281 --> 00:49:32,250
to pick the worst dancer of their class.

1167
00:49:32,251 --> 00:49:33,591
This is an important moment...

1168
00:49:33,921 --> 00:49:37,760
where the director's decision may change the ranking of countries.

1169
00:49:37,761 --> 00:49:38,990
(Clicking her tongue)

1170
00:49:38,991 --> 00:49:40,430
A country's ranking.

1171
00:49:40,431 --> 00:49:42,161
Goodness.

1172
00:49:43,131 --> 00:49:45,091
- This is making me so nervous.
- Yes, this is...

1173
00:49:45,831 --> 00:49:48,330
You know, the thing about Street Woman Fighter...

1174
00:49:48,331 --> 00:49:50,800
When do dancers have an opportunity...

1175
00:49:50,801 --> 00:49:53,711
to be the star of their own music video? Right?

1176
00:49:54,171 --> 00:49:58,240
To have an opportunity like this is literally once in a lifetime.

1177
00:49:58,241 --> 00:50:01,250
The world-renowned dancers that enter this show.

1178
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:03,320
They know that, going into this show.

1179
00:50:03,321 --> 00:50:05,380
There needs to be something that will really surprise us.

1180
00:50:05,381 --> 00:50:07,020
First, you need to have the moment.

1181
00:50:07,021 --> 00:50:10,261
You need to have that inspiration.

1182
00:50:10,461 --> 00:50:12,761
I'm excited and I'm curious.

1183
00:50:12,991 --> 00:50:14,261
I can't wait to see yours.

1184
00:50:14,591 --> 00:50:15,760
Yes, me too.

1185
00:50:15,761 --> 00:50:17,060
I can't wait to see theirs, as well.

1186
00:50:17,061 --> 00:50:18,600
And the leaders'. Everyone's.

1187
00:50:18,601 --> 00:50:20,271
I wonder how it turned out.

1188
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:22,130
The directors of each class...

1189
00:50:22,131 --> 00:50:24,941
will now check their class's dance video...

1190
00:50:25,201 --> 00:50:28,371
and choose the worst dancer.

1191
00:50:28,711 --> 00:50:30,741
(Nervous)

1192
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,111
On the spot?

1193
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,311
No, I'm scared.

1194
00:50:33,811 --> 00:50:35,151
Which class will be first?

1195
00:50:35,351 --> 00:50:38,420
First of all, which crew did the director of the rookie class...

1196
00:50:38,421 --> 00:50:41,320
choose to become the star of the Director's cut?

1197
00:50:41,321 --> 00:50:42,651
Being chosen for...

1198
00:50:42,821 --> 00:50:45,661
the Director's cut is the most important.

1199
00:50:45,761 --> 00:50:47,260
I think it will be you.

1200
00:50:47,261 --> 00:50:48,560
I have a good feeling about it.

1201
00:50:48,561 --> 00:50:50,301
Gosh, I'm a bit nervous.

1202
00:50:50,731 --> 00:50:52,360
Our crew has to end up in the Director's cut.

1203
00:50:52,361 --> 00:50:55,231
I'm confident we'll be chosen for the Director's cut.

1204
00:50:55,531 --> 00:50:56,540
(Rookie class practice day)

1205
00:50:56,541 --> 00:50:58,141
Okay, guys. Let's start.

1206
00:50:58,341 --> 00:50:59,841
(Cheering)

1207
00:51:00,111 --> 00:51:01,111
Let's go.

1208
00:51:01,112 --> 00:51:03,010
To not be chosen as the worst dancer,

1209
00:51:03,011 --> 00:51:04,731
I should always give my best in everything.

1210
00:51:05,411 --> 00:51:06,511
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1211
00:51:07,081 --> 00:51:08,680
- Everyone's seen their part?
- Yes.

1212
00:51:08,681 --> 00:51:11,080
We'll just start by doing the Director's cut.

1213
00:51:11,081 --> 00:51:12,081
All right.

1214
00:51:12,251 --> 00:51:15,550
(Directors Vanessa and Aaliyah show them a draft of the choreography.)

1215
00:51:15,551 --> 00:51:17,021
(Amazed)

1216
00:51:19,591 --> 00:51:20,691
(Flexible)

1217
00:51:21,091 --> 00:51:22,371
(I recognize that choreography!)

1218
00:51:23,061 --> 00:51:25,037
(It was AG SQUAD's highlight move during Choreography Selection.)

1219
00:51:25,061 --> 00:51:26,131
(Shocked)

1220
00:51:26,601 --> 00:51:29,362
(They used their highlight move for the Director's cut choreography.)

1221
00:51:29,501 --> 00:51:31,171
(Clapping)

1222
00:51:31,271 --> 00:51:32,971
So nice.

1223
00:51:33,311 --> 00:51:34,311
It's very detailed.

1224
00:51:34,811 --> 00:51:37,341
(Lip J starts practicing right away.)

1225
00:51:39,011 --> 00:51:40,311
It's so fast.

1226
00:51:40,581 --> 00:51:42,010
(The rookies officially kick off their practice.)

1227
00:51:42,011 --> 00:51:45,020
And flip, flop.

1228
00:51:45,021 --> 00:51:46,850
I think the choreography is just a sketch...

1229
00:51:46,851 --> 00:51:50,720
and the competition is about how each crew brings it to life.

1230
00:51:50,721 --> 00:51:54,330
BUMSUP is definitely going to style it iconically.

1231
00:51:54,331 --> 00:51:55,830
I've already lost my choreography.

1232
00:51:55,831 --> 00:51:57,801
I have to make it onto the Director's cut.

1233
00:52:00,331 --> 00:52:04,140
It suits the styles that I and Kylie are used to.

1234
00:52:04,141 --> 00:52:05,141
Yes, perfect.

1235
00:52:05,142 --> 00:52:08,641
So already, we've got the upper hand.

1236
00:52:09,171 --> 00:52:10,180
(A mysterious warning letter)

1237
00:52:10,181 --> 00:52:13,551
"Worst dancer nominee after the first rehearsal. Rookie class."

1238
00:52:13,911 --> 00:52:14,911
What?

1239
00:52:15,451 --> 00:52:16,851
Are they saying that we're...

1240
00:52:16,921 --> 00:52:18,281
We think it's funny.

1241
00:52:21,251 --> 00:52:22,751
That's insane.

1242
00:52:22,891 --> 00:52:24,360
This is getting on my nerves.

1243
00:52:24,361 --> 00:52:26,560
We were just confused and found it funny.

1244
00:52:26,561 --> 00:52:29,030
We do things quite quickly and so...

1245
00:52:29,031 --> 00:52:31,430
There were times when we'd just be chilling,

1246
00:52:31,431 --> 00:52:34,270
as well as just playing around, having fun.

1247
00:52:34,271 --> 00:52:35,801
But honestly,

1248
00:52:36,101 --> 00:52:38,400
they haven't picked us as worst dancers yet.

1249
00:52:38,401 --> 00:52:40,070
They only nominated us.

1250
00:52:40,071 --> 00:52:41,440
We can show them...

1251
00:52:41,441 --> 00:52:44,980
that we're not the worst dancers in the room right now.

1252
00:52:44,981 --> 00:52:48,610
ROYAL FAMILY are known to be quite strong performers,

1253
00:52:48,611 --> 00:52:50,250
so I feel very confident.

1254
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:52,150
I want us to get the Director's cut.

1255
00:52:52,151 --> 00:52:54,091
At all costs. We can't lose.

1256
00:52:56,291 --> 00:52:57,291
One, two.

1257
00:52:57,292 --> 00:53:00,260
I am comfortable doing these types of movements.

1258
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:02,031
Flip, flop.

1259
00:53:02,391 --> 00:53:03,900
I keep letting go of your hand here.

1260
00:53:03,901 --> 00:53:06,971
To be honest, right now I'm feeling...

1261
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:10,600
a bit concerned. I feel quite anxious.

1262
00:53:10,601 --> 00:53:13,710
I think teamwork will be crucial.

1263
00:53:13,711 --> 00:53:14,711
Practice!

1264
00:53:14,911 --> 00:53:17,411
We will work hard to master the Director's Cut and get it!

1265
00:53:17,841 --> 00:53:20,350
Aaliyah and I will choose the Director's cut...

1266
00:53:20,351 --> 00:53:21,880
based on ability,

1267
00:53:21,881 --> 00:53:24,380
just because it's directed by us...

1268
00:53:24,381 --> 00:53:25,981
so we want to make it look good.

1269
00:53:27,091 --> 00:53:28,891
(The rookie class video shoot location)

1270
00:53:32,221 --> 00:53:33,260
(Director's seat)

1271
00:53:33,261 --> 00:53:34,730
This is where I belong.

1272
00:53:34,731 --> 00:53:36,331
(Bursts out laughing)

1273
00:53:36,461 --> 00:53:39,231
Okay. So we're about to do the Director's cut.

1274
00:53:39,501 --> 00:53:41,701
RHTokyo, be ready.

1275
00:53:42,131 --> 00:53:43,131
(Director's cut, RHTokyo's Reina and Rico Hirai)

1276
00:53:43,132 --> 00:53:45,901
RHTokyo.

1277
00:53:46,141 --> 00:53:48,470
We're serious about getting...

1278
00:53:48,471 --> 00:53:49,740
the Director's cut in this mission.

1279
00:53:49,741 --> 00:53:51,880
The two of us kept practicing.

1280
00:53:51,881 --> 00:53:55,281
I want us to take the Director's cut.

1281
00:53:58,321 --> 00:53:59,881
I love the way they execute it.

1282
00:54:01,521 --> 00:54:02,751
(Keeping an eye on them)

1283
00:54:02,851 --> 00:54:04,590
(Director's cut, RHTokyo's Reina and Rico Hirai)

1284
00:54:04,591 --> 00:54:06,730
She ate.

1285
00:54:06,731 --> 00:54:08,790
She's like, "You out."

1286
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:11,360
She was like, "You're not cutting this."

1287
00:54:11,361 --> 00:54:12,731
"You out."

1288
00:54:13,161 --> 00:54:14,371
(Tense)

1289
00:54:14,701 --> 00:54:17,640
There wasn't a single moment where I was blown away.

1290
00:54:17,641 --> 00:54:19,301
BUMSUP, let's go.

1291
00:54:20,271 --> 00:54:22,910
We practiced our teamwork a lot,

1292
00:54:22,911 --> 00:54:24,541
and we worked on our facial expressions.

1293
00:54:25,541 --> 00:54:27,211
Now, let's go.

1294
00:54:28,911 --> 00:54:31,620
(Director's Cut, BUMSUP's Lip J and Hyeily)

1295
00:54:31,621 --> 00:54:33,151
I love Lip J.

1296
00:54:34,351 --> 00:54:36,590
Literally the best vibes.

1297
00:54:36,591 --> 00:54:37,791
Best vibes.

1298
00:54:37,991 --> 00:54:40,761
I feel like they feel it through a little bit more.

1299
00:54:40,961 --> 00:54:42,331
All right. Let's go.

1300
00:54:43,091 --> 00:54:44,301
Music, please.

1301
00:54:44,961 --> 00:54:46,030
(Director's Cut, ROYAL FAMILY's Maiya and Kylie)

1302
00:54:46,031 --> 00:54:47,931
It's so gutsy.

1303
00:54:49,231 --> 00:54:50,641
(Focused)

1304
00:54:53,101 --> 00:54:55,110
I think I did really well.

1305
00:54:55,111 --> 00:54:56,240
They're strong.

1306
00:54:56,241 --> 00:54:58,511
The other teams were just like that much.

1307
00:54:59,241 --> 00:55:00,411
Let's go, OSAKA Ojo Gang.

1308
00:55:01,181 --> 00:55:02,381
Music, please.

1309
00:55:05,551 --> 00:55:08,521
I feel like, in a way, their lines...

1310
00:55:08,721 --> 00:55:12,191
are a softer version of our own.

1311
00:55:12,921 --> 00:55:14,001
It was a bit underwhelming.

1312
00:55:14,031 --> 00:55:15,730
MOTIV, your turn.

1313
00:55:15,731 --> 00:55:18,901
Me and Kaidi did prepare a lot for Director's cut.

1314
00:55:19,501 --> 00:55:21,330
(Director's cut, MOTIV's Kaidi and Abby)

1315
00:55:21,331 --> 00:55:23,701
The takes that me and Kaidi did felt strong.

1316
00:55:26,171 --> 00:55:27,271
Nice.

1317
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:29,111
- Let it sit. Let it marinate.
- Okay.

1318
00:55:29,971 --> 00:55:32,940
I love MOTIV, as well.

1319
00:55:32,941 --> 00:55:34,861
But I don't love the way they did the beginning.

1320
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:36,050
I did like this.

1321
00:55:36,051 --> 00:55:38,551
I love how gutsy they were.

1322
00:55:38,721 --> 00:55:40,620
I think the shape looks nice.

1323
00:55:40,621 --> 00:55:42,791
They finished the movements.

1324
00:55:43,421 --> 00:55:46,320
It's all about the tiny details.

1325
00:55:46,321 --> 00:55:48,061
This is hard.

1326
00:55:49,291 --> 00:55:53,971
Now, evaluation of the rookie class dance video will begin.

00:55:56,301 --> 00:55:58,301

Let's go!

1329
00:56:01,971 --> 00:56:04,481
Vanessa has that star quality.

1330
00:56:04,681 --> 00:56:06,011
- And Aaliyah.
- Yes.

1331
00:56:06,381 --> 00:56:07,751
I want to feel it.

Okay, main girls.

1412
01:00:31,741 --> 01:00:32,980
- This is the moment right here.
- Yes.

1413

- This is the moment.
- Totally.

1414
01:00:34,251 --> 01:00:37,850
I think Aaliyah and Vanessa did a good job of giving themselves...

1415
01:00:37,851 --> 01:00:39,721
a really memorable moment.

1416
01:00:40,221 --> 01:00:41,291
Great concept.

1417
01:00:41,321 --> 01:00:43,021
- Absolutely.
- Okay. So...

1418
01:00:43,221 --> 01:00:45,990
two moments that hit us were...

1419
01:00:45,991 --> 01:00:48,130
- the non-dancing parts.
- The non-dancing parts.

1420
01:00:48,131 --> 01:00:49,260
Yes, that's so true.

1421

- Yes.
- More of the pictures.

01:00:54,371 --> 01:00:58,370
they failed to impress us with a certain choreography.

1425
01:00:58,371 --> 01:01:00,001
- Yes.
- I totally agree.

1426
01:01:00,201 --> 01:01:02,910
But RHTokyo took the director's cut.

1427
01:01:02,911 --> 01:01:04,241
No. You guys still did well.

1428
01:01:04,511 --> 01:01:07,350
- This is incredible. I'm so happy.
- Thank you.

1429
01:01:07,351 --> 01:01:08,910
I hope we'll also get the Director's cut.

1430
01:01:08,911 --> 01:01:10,650
It'll be incredible if we get two.

1431
01:01:10,651 --> 01:01:12,520
It'll be incredible. We'll be the strongest crew.

1432
01:01:12,521 --> 01:01:14,150
I'm upset about the Director's cut.

1433
01:01:14,151 --> 01:01:15,290
Why?

1434
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:16,650
Still, it's the most important...

1435
01:01:16,651 --> 01:01:18,411
to avoid getting picked as the worst dancer.

1436
01:01:18,791 --> 01:01:20,990
Directors Aaliyah and Vanessa,

1437
01:01:20,991 --> 01:01:23,331
please decide on the worst dancer.

1438
01:01:24,101 --> 01:01:26,161
- All right, guys.
- Period.

1439
01:01:27,031 --> 01:01:28,731
(Sighing)

1440
01:01:29,001 --> 01:01:30,700
ROYAL FAMILY had a big sense of presence.

1441
01:01:30,701 --> 01:01:32,470
- They did.
- So it can't be them.

1442
01:01:32,471 --> 01:01:33,640
You guys did great.

1443
01:01:33,641 --> 01:01:35,411
It's obviously not you guys.

1444
01:01:35,641 --> 01:01:37,710
I think it'll be OSAKA Ojo Gang.

1445
01:01:37,711 --> 01:01:39,681
I feel like it might be someone from BUMSUP.

1446
01:01:40,011 --> 01:01:42,311
I don't know. It can be anybody at this point.

1447
01:01:42,481 --> 01:01:43,611
Imagine them picking...

1448
01:01:43,921 --> 01:01:45,621
RHTokyo as the worst dancer.

1449
01:01:45,751 --> 01:01:47,250
And then there was the Director's cut.

1450
01:01:47,251 --> 01:01:48,951
- That'd be crazy.
- That'd be crazy.

1451
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,261
Are you still thinking the same?

1452
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:52,491
Yes.

1453
01:01:54,031 --> 01:01:58,560
I also think, strategically, RHTokyo, us, and ROYAL FAMILY...

1454
01:01:58,561 --> 01:02:02,200
We're among the three that are high-ranked right now.

1455
01:02:02,201 --> 01:02:05,000
We might give them the worst dancer...

1456
01:02:05,001 --> 01:02:08,371
to get rid of the points that they just received.

1457
01:02:09,111 --> 01:02:10,240
It might be funny...

1458
01:02:10,241 --> 01:02:13,381
if we gave the worst dancer to the Director's cut crew.

1459
01:02:13,951 --> 01:02:17,821
It'd be like, "You got the feature. But we took away your points."

1460
01:02:18,021 --> 01:02:21,621
Getting the Director's cut as well as the worst dancer?

1461
01:02:21,751 --> 01:02:23,391
That's a bit...

1462
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:26,021
(Take this!)

1463
01:02:26,261 --> 01:02:28,460
That won't happen, right?

1464
01:02:28,461 --> 01:02:30,260
- That won't happen. No way.
- No way.

1465
01:02:30,261 --> 01:02:31,761
That won't happen.

1466
01:02:32,031 --> 01:02:35,000
AG SQUAD's Aaliyah and Vanessa,

1467
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:38,301
please pick the worst dancer of the rookie class.

1468
01:02:39,201 --> 01:02:40,201
(Let's take deep breaths and relax.)

1469
01:02:40,202 --> 01:02:41,941
I don't know what they're thinking.

1470
01:02:42,811 --> 01:02:43,811
(Breathing out)

1471
01:02:43,812 --> 01:02:44,941
I'm really nervous.

1472
01:02:44,981 --> 01:02:46,811
I'm so scared.

1473
01:02:48,751 --> 01:02:50,111
Okay.

1474
01:02:54,991 --> 01:02:56,090
So...

1475
01:02:56,091 --> 01:02:57,660
(Could it be us?)

1476
01:02:57,661 --> 01:03:01,430
the worst dancer is...

1477
01:03:01,431 --> 01:03:03,291
(The worst dancer of the rookie class is...)

1478
01:03:03,431 --> 01:03:04,861
Is...

1479
01:03:05,431 --> 01:03:07,600
(The rookie class's worst dancer)

1480
01:03:07,601 --> 01:03:10,670
ROYAL FAMILY.

1481
01:03:10,671 --> 01:03:12,871
(They try to stay calm.)

1482
01:03:16,011 --> 01:03:20,180
So the reason why we ended up coming to this decision is this.

1483
01:03:20,181 --> 01:03:23,150
It turns out that ROYAL FAMILY... You guys ended up...

1484
01:03:23,151 --> 01:03:26,380
getting distracted and started doing TikTok and...

1485
01:03:26,381 --> 01:03:28,150
(I see.)

1486
01:03:28,151 --> 01:03:29,650
TikTok was a bit too much.

1487
01:03:29,651 --> 01:03:30,891
Did they do TikTok?

1488
01:03:32,021 --> 01:03:34,091
We never did TikTok.

1489
01:03:35,361 --> 01:03:36,361
(During the rookie class' practice)

1490
01:03:36,362 --> 01:03:37,930
That's so funny.

1491
01:03:37,931 --> 01:03:39,731
(While everyone was absorbed in practicing)

1492
01:03:40,971 --> 01:03:42,270
They're doing TikTok.

1493
01:03:42,271 --> 01:03:46,271
I heard music. I turned around and they were filming TikTok.

1494
01:03:46,341 --> 01:03:48,010
(Moreover)

1495
01:03:48,011 --> 01:03:50,110
Do you know that TikTok? It's like...

1496
01:03:50,111 --> 01:03:51,741
(What?)

1497
01:03:53,541 --> 01:03:55,281
- It's funny.
- Okay.

1498
01:03:55,611 --> 01:03:57,110
- Right now?
- I guess they want to film it.

1499
01:03:57,111 --> 01:03:58,620
I'm watching right now.

1500
01:03:58,621 --> 01:04:00,120
I don't like that they're doing Tiktok.

1501
01:04:00,121 --> 01:04:01,121
Yes, I know.

1502
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:03,667
(Their passion for TikTok didn't end during the dance video shoot.)

1503
01:04:03,691 --> 01:04:06,261
We're singing. We're having fun, like...

1504
01:04:07,061 --> 01:04:08,790
That's right. That's how it is.

1505
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:10,531
No, I do mind.

1506
01:04:10,831 --> 01:04:12,561
Parris would probably break your phone.

1507
01:04:13,001 --> 01:04:14,500
You don't do that on a job.

1508
01:04:14,501 --> 01:04:18,570
Yes. It was actually funny to watch their Director's cut.

1509
01:04:18,571 --> 01:04:21,311
It didn't level up. It was like, the same.

1510
01:04:21,511 --> 01:04:24,740
It's not just the way you dance. It's also the things...

1511
01:04:24,741 --> 01:04:26,910
- behind the scenes, so...
- It's crucial.

1512
01:04:26,911 --> 01:04:28,081
- Yes.
- Yes.

1513
01:04:28,381 --> 01:04:29,610
Attitude reasons?

1514
01:04:29,611 --> 01:04:32,321
It's just a little weird on my side, but...

1515
01:04:32,621 --> 01:04:34,751
- They gave them the reason.
- That's right.

1516
01:04:36,151 --> 01:04:39,460
- I personally think we slayed that.
- Yes.

1517
01:04:39,461 --> 01:04:40,891
Yes. It's just...

1518
01:04:41,091 --> 01:04:43,790
I wouldn't say that we're the worst dancers.

1519
01:04:43,791 --> 01:04:46,161
We were actually giving energy in the room.

1520
01:04:47,631 --> 01:04:50,700
Thus, the worst dancer of the Rookie Class,

1521
01:04:50,701 --> 01:04:55,210
ROYAL FAMILY lost 50 points.

1522
01:04:55,211 --> 01:04:56,671
Losing 50 points is big.

1523
01:04:57,071 --> 01:04:59,941
That's cruel. That'll happen to any crew that loses.

1524
01:05:00,851 --> 01:05:02,880
That's so dumb. Choosing us.

1525
01:05:02,881 --> 01:05:04,580
Wouldn't you go for a team that has zero points?

1526
01:05:04,581 --> 01:05:06,250
That'll put them in the negative.

1527
01:05:06,251 --> 01:05:09,020
No, they're trying to cut their biggest competitors.

1528
01:05:09,021 --> 01:05:11,291
- We're a threat to them.
- Yes.

1529
01:05:11,321 --> 01:05:12,391
Yes.

1530
01:05:13,621 --> 01:05:15,930
They want revenge. I've never seen them so serious.

1531
01:05:15,931 --> 01:05:17,830
They've always been playful.

1532
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:19,131
Maybe they'll choose each other.

1533
01:05:20,131 --> 01:05:22,971
Let's watch the dance video of the middle class.

1534
01:05:24,201 --> 01:05:25,741
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1535
01:05:26,001 --> 01:05:27,310
(We're totally excited!)

1536
01:05:27,311 --> 01:05:28,311
It's our turn.

1537
01:05:29,011 --> 01:05:31,941
The middle class' main dancers and directors are...

1538
01:05:32,181 --> 01:05:34,050
ROYAL FAMILY's...

1539
01:05:34,051 --> 01:05:37,520
Isla, Moana, Harmz, and Zari.

1540
01:05:37,521 --> 01:05:40,620
Were there any difficulties about directing a video...

1541
01:05:40,621 --> 01:05:43,151
while leading a big group of 24 dancers?

1542
01:05:43,391 --> 01:05:46,120
I think all the girls that were a part of this mission...

1543
01:05:46,121 --> 01:05:48,460
were so strong and so efficient.

1544
01:05:48,461 --> 01:05:50,461
It made the process really easy.

1545
01:05:51,201 --> 01:05:52,260
We aren't happy with them.

1546
01:05:52,261 --> 01:05:53,261
(Unhappy)

1547
01:05:53,831 --> 01:05:56,071
(How was the middle class's practice?)

1548
01:05:57,001 --> 01:05:58,300
Five, six, seven.

1549
01:05:58,301 --> 01:06:00,301
(The middle class's group practice with 24 people)

1550
01:06:00,671 --> 01:06:02,441
(Full of power)

1551
01:06:05,311 --> 01:06:07,010
(ROYAL FAMILY is checking the dancers' choreography.)

1552
01:06:07,011 --> 01:06:09,810
We'll put the formation with the stickers on the board.

1553
01:06:09,811 --> 01:06:12,221
Then everyone can see it and go that way.

1554
01:06:13,021 --> 01:06:14,320
Kaleece and Alysha.

1555
01:06:14,321 --> 01:06:17,021
And then Bella and Mona... Fantaye?

1556
01:06:17,091 --> 01:06:20,021
If we watch it, the front should obviously be stronger.

1557
01:06:20,391 --> 01:06:21,991
- I don't think they'll accept it.
- No.

1558
01:06:22,331 --> 01:06:25,960
Okay. Alysha, over here. Kyra.

1559
01:06:25,961 --> 01:06:28,471
Ruthy and then Kaleece.

1560
01:06:28,671 --> 01:06:32,900
Next line, Ruu, Rena, Hyojin Choi,

1561
01:06:32,901 --> 01:06:35,441
no: ze, Asuka, and Hana.

1562
01:06:36,141 --> 01:06:38,110
And then...

1563
01:06:38,111 --> 01:06:40,411
- OSAKA, can you be in this corner?
- OSAKA.

1564
01:06:41,351 --> 01:06:43,610
And then Korea will be...

1565
01:06:43,611 --> 01:06:45,880
- adding on to our diagonal.
- Okay.

1566
01:06:45,881 --> 01:06:48,550
All Korean and Japanese dancers were in the back.

1567
01:06:48,551 --> 01:06:50,821
We were totally invisible.

1568
01:06:51,021 --> 01:06:52,060
Not at all.

1569
01:06:52,061 --> 01:06:54,830
We just felt like they looked like us.

1570
01:06:54,831 --> 01:06:58,000
We put those who looked the strongest at the front.

1571
01:06:58,001 --> 01:07:00,301
It was quite sad.

1572
01:07:00,431 --> 01:07:03,570
We're in a position where we have to work incredibly hard...

1573
01:07:03,571 --> 01:07:04,801
despite being invisible.

1574
01:07:05,601 --> 01:07:09,510
We dance as a group and there are 24 people.

1575
01:07:09,511 --> 01:07:13,240
We aren't very visible unless we're in the first row.

1576
01:07:13,241 --> 01:07:15,681
The Director's cut!

1577
01:07:15,911 --> 01:07:17,550
Without getting chosen, the three invisible crews will be...

1578
01:07:17,551 --> 01:07:19,180
in danger of becoming the worst dancer.

1579
01:07:19,181 --> 01:07:20,520
(Minami of OSAKA Ojo Gang)

1580
01:07:20,521 --> 01:07:23,720
In terms of the crew's Director's cut,

1581
01:07:23,721 --> 01:07:25,390
how each dancer shines...

1582
01:07:25,391 --> 01:07:28,561
will be important.

1583
01:07:28,931 --> 01:07:30,977
(OSAKA Ojo Gang comes back to the Crew Agit after practice.)

1584
01:07:31,001 --> 01:07:33,001
If we can get the Director's cut,

1585
01:07:33,031 --> 01:07:34,631
the tables will be turned.

1586
01:07:35,771 --> 01:07:37,570
(Spotting something)

1587
01:07:37,571 --> 01:07:38,771
What is it?

1588
01:07:38,901 --> 01:07:40,441
What? The worst dancer nominee?

1589
01:07:40,701 --> 01:07:42,710
"The worst dancer after the first rehearsal?"

1590
01:07:42,711 --> 01:07:45,040
"Do your best so that you won't get picked. Good luck?"

1591
01:07:45,041 --> 01:07:48,911
Don't be funny!

1592
01:07:49,211 --> 01:07:50,611
Of course, I'm not happy.

1593
01:07:50,981 --> 01:07:52,551
But I have no choice but to do my best.

1594
01:07:53,281 --> 01:07:56,151
We have to choose the worst after that, right?

1595
01:07:56,421 --> 01:07:59,321
I feel like it would motivate me if we got the Director's cut.

1596
01:07:59,461 --> 01:08:01,561
We really have to do our best.

1597
01:08:01,961 --> 01:08:05,231
Director's cut. We need to be different.

1598
01:08:05,531 --> 01:08:07,730
Unfortunately, we lost the choreography,

1599
01:08:07,731 --> 01:08:10,870
so we ended up being the backup dancers for this clip.

1600
01:08:10,871 --> 01:08:14,711
However, that doesn't stop AG SQUAD from shining.

1601
01:08:14,871 --> 01:08:18,280
We'll always give it our all no matter what. We don't back down.

1602
01:08:18,281 --> 01:08:20,950
Since it's the Director's cut,

1603
01:08:20,951 --> 01:08:25,580
I wanted our crew's unique side captured in it.

1604
01:08:25,581 --> 01:08:28,221
I thought it would be selected if it was a bit more unique.

1605
01:08:28,821 --> 01:08:30,750
We just want to showcase...

1606
01:08:30,751 --> 01:08:34,361
that strong and fun energy while doing something that...

1607
01:08:34,461 --> 01:08:37,161
I feel like the other crews don't really have.

1608
01:08:38,301 --> 01:08:40,300
Since we couldn't become the main dancer,

1609
01:08:40,301 --> 01:08:43,631
I thought, "We really shouldn't lose this opportunity."

1610
01:08:43,731 --> 01:08:47,271
"We should really get the Director's cut."

1611
01:08:47,611 --> 01:08:51,141
We're the nominee for the worst dancer,

1612
01:08:51,241 --> 01:08:54,410
but I think how much we could change that image...

1613
01:08:54,411 --> 01:08:56,051
is our challenge.

1614
01:08:56,251 --> 01:08:59,721
We should show them a hundred times more.

1615
01:09:00,121 --> 01:09:01,251
I want to do my best.

1616
01:09:02,421 --> 01:09:04,421
We'll start the Director's cut.

1617
01:09:04,821 --> 01:09:06,560
(ROYAL FAMILY is monitoring seriously.)

1618
01:09:06,561 --> 01:09:09,190
Who was able to execute and perform...

1619
01:09:09,191 --> 01:09:12,531
the eight count that we choreographed the best?

1620
01:09:12,631 --> 01:09:15,930
What would also fit best with the rest of the video...

1621
01:09:15,931 --> 01:09:18,271
that we had created and come up with?

1622
01:09:20,201 --> 01:09:24,341
(The crews are using the time in between to practice.)

1623
01:09:26,011 --> 01:09:28,450
We used props. We used the bandanas.

1624
01:09:28,451 --> 01:09:31,621
We thought of the camera angles when making it up.

1625
01:09:31,981 --> 01:09:32,981
(Meanwhile, )

1626
01:09:32,982 --> 01:09:34,820
(OSAKA Ojo Gang seems to be in thought.)

1627
01:09:34,821 --> 01:09:37,020
(Let's talk about it now!)

1628
01:09:37,021 --> 01:09:38,191
Could you check this?

1629
01:09:38,291 --> 01:09:40,291
(Kyoka approaches ROYAL FAMILY.)

1630
01:09:40,591 --> 01:09:41,831
(What's going on?)

1631
01:09:41,931 --> 01:09:43,460
(Attentive)

1632
01:09:43,461 --> 01:09:45,330
We want to take it like this.

1633
01:09:45,331 --> 01:09:46,360
(Showing them the choreography section)

1634
01:09:46,361 --> 01:09:48,570
Nominees for the worst dancer. We're just the nominee.

1635
01:09:48,571 --> 01:09:52,341
I think how we showcase our qualities in the Director's cut...

1636
01:09:52,441 --> 01:09:54,711
will be a great opportunity.

1637
01:09:54,811 --> 01:09:58,381
Honestly, I really want us to take it.

1638
01:09:58,881 --> 01:10:00,981
I really don't want to get this title.

1639
01:10:02,151 --> 01:10:03,980
Ojo Gang ladies.

1640
01:10:03,981 --> 01:10:05,551
Let's go.

1641
01:10:06,281 --> 01:10:07,380
(Let's see.)

1642
01:10:07,381 --> 01:10:09,991
Five, six!

1643
01:10:12,491 --> 01:10:13,491
(Nice)

1644
01:10:16,091 --> 01:10:18,291
(She gets startled by the camera as it came too close.)

1645
01:10:19,401 --> 01:10:20,630
(Smiling)

1646
01:10:20,631 --> 01:10:21,951
She looked a little bit confused.

1647
01:10:23,131 --> 01:10:26,700
We were given a short time for the Director's cut.

1648
01:10:26,701 --> 01:10:30,411
It felt like it was hard to realize that.

1649
01:10:30,511 --> 01:10:31,511
Last one.

1650
01:10:31,512 --> 01:10:34,241
One more, and tell him to go faster.

1651
01:10:35,151 --> 01:10:37,650
Cleanliness and maybe tidying up their moves.

1652
01:10:37,651 --> 01:10:41,021
Even like the cut going to the side was all good.

1653
01:10:41,491 --> 01:10:43,150
There were parts that stood out,

1654
01:10:43,151 --> 01:10:45,221
so I think it was nice in that sense.

1655
01:10:46,491 --> 01:10:47,830
Let's rehearse.

1656
01:10:47,831 --> 01:10:49,531
We'll go right away.

1657
01:10:50,591 --> 01:10:52,731
I really want to show them my best...

1658
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:54,871
so they would want to select ours.

1659
01:10:55,071 --> 01:10:56,591
We shouldn't become the worst dancers.

1660
01:10:57,101 --> 01:10:58,501
Let's go, BUMSUP.

1661
01:10:58,601 --> 01:10:59,641
Let's go.

1662
01:11:00,471 --> 01:11:03,340
They didn't change too much of our choreography,

1663
01:11:03,341 --> 01:11:04,540
but it was also creative.

1664
01:11:04,541 --> 01:11:06,141
BUMSUP's cut was my favorite.

1665
01:11:07,751 --> 01:11:09,251
Nice, girls.

1666
01:11:09,851 --> 01:11:11,921
- Fire.
- Nice.

1667
01:11:12,121 --> 01:11:13,121
(Staring)

1668
01:11:13,122 --> 01:11:17,960
OSAKA Ojo Gang and BUMSUP...

1669
01:11:17,961 --> 01:11:21,361
seemed to be lacking a bit.

1670
01:11:23,091 --> 01:11:25,501
I thought, "Good. We would be taking it."

1671
01:11:26,131 --> 01:11:30,171
"RHTokyo's Director's cut"

1672
01:11:30,271 --> 01:11:33,671
"Free choreography section"

1673
01:11:35,941 --> 01:11:36,941
Lit.

1674
01:11:37,371 --> 01:11:39,810
I love how everyone has thought of something different.

1675
01:11:39,811 --> 01:11:40,811
Right.

1676
01:11:41,011 --> 01:11:43,781
Okay. Next one. MOTIV.

1677
01:11:44,111 --> 01:11:45,321
Five, six.

1678
01:11:46,351 --> 01:11:47,991
(Perfect synchronization)

1679
01:11:48,351 --> 01:11:49,750
(She noticed something.)

1680
01:11:49,751 --> 01:11:51,621
They're not looking at the camera.

1681
01:11:52,461 --> 01:11:54,431
Right.

1682
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:57,391
(Fantaye is the only one looking at the camera.)

1683
01:11:57,561 --> 01:11:59,200
I liked it. Did you guys like it?

1684
01:11:59,201 --> 01:12:00,201
- Yes.
- Yes.

1685
01:12:00,661 --> 01:12:02,230
Fantaye is...

1686
01:12:02,231 --> 01:12:03,801
So good. She's the only one, though.

1687
01:12:04,901 --> 01:12:06,601
Fantaye.

1688
01:12:08,171 --> 01:12:09,511
That one. Yes.

1689
01:12:10,311 --> 01:12:11,311
Bella?

1690
01:12:12,581 --> 01:12:14,911
Can anybody hear me?

1691
01:12:16,411 --> 01:12:17,481
Can they hear you?

1692
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:20,821
There's no purpose to this.

1693
01:12:21,121 --> 01:12:22,721
(Checking)

1694
01:12:22,821 --> 01:12:25,720
- Should we just keep that in mind?
- Yes.

1695
01:12:25,721 --> 01:12:26,721
Okay.

1696
01:12:26,921 --> 01:12:29,290
Fantaye was just strong.

1697
01:12:29,291 --> 01:12:31,960
Her presence was just right in the camera.

1698
01:12:31,961 --> 01:12:35,201
Whereas the other girls, I feel like they were holding back a little bit.

1699
01:12:35,271 --> 01:12:37,100
As well as their performance.

1700
01:12:37,101 --> 01:12:40,441
(Free choreography section)

1701
01:12:40,541 --> 01:12:41,541
AG SQUAD.

1702
01:12:41,542 --> 01:12:43,841
(AG SQUAD goes last.)

1703
01:12:44,141 --> 01:12:48,051
AG SQUAD was the original owner of this choreography.

1704
01:12:48,451 --> 01:12:51,121
Our style and AG SQUAD's style are very similar.

1705
01:12:51,321 --> 01:12:52,481
I'm very curious.

1706
01:12:53,721 --> 01:12:56,851
If it was dancing-wise and creativity-wise,

1707
01:12:56,951 --> 01:12:58,021
it would be us.

1708
01:12:59,491 --> 01:13:01,231
(Relaxed)

1709
01:13:01,331 --> 01:13:02,331
Let's go.

1710
01:13:02,332 --> 01:13:03,491
(Anticipating)

1711
01:13:03,591 --> 01:13:07,730
(AG SQUAD's Director's cut)

1712
01:13:07,731 --> 01:13:11,271
(Free choreography section)

1713
01:13:12,671 --> 01:13:13,901
That's so creative.

1714
01:13:16,241 --> 01:13:18,440
I feel like that first part was changed a lot.

1715
01:13:18,441 --> 01:13:19,441
Yes.

1716
01:13:19,841 --> 01:13:24,151
I couldn't really notice our first choreography that we gave.

1717
01:13:24,381 --> 01:13:27,380
So as much as I loved the second part,

1718
01:13:27,381 --> 01:13:28,890
we had to keep the first part...

1719
01:13:28,891 --> 01:13:31,891
because that's part of the Director's cut shoot.

1720
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:34,730
Amazing work today, girls.

1721
01:13:34,731 --> 01:13:36,131
(All the shooting ended.)

1722
01:13:36,661 --> 01:13:39,260
(The ROYAL FAMILY directors monitor everything carefully.)

1723
01:13:39,261 --> 01:13:41,101
- I think we've decided.
- We've decided.

1724
01:13:41,431 --> 01:13:43,901
For Director's cut is...

1725
01:13:46,201 --> 01:13:49,440
Which crew will be selected for the Director's cut...

1726
01:13:49,441 --> 01:13:50,741
in the middle class?

1727
01:13:50,941 --> 01:13:53,981
We will start evaluating the dance videos...

1728
01:13:54,181 --> 01:13:55,181
for the middle class.

1729
01:13:55,751 --> 01:13:57,210
Let's go, girls.

1730
01:13:57,211 --> 01:13:58,351
Let's watch it.

1731
01:13:58,821 --> 01:14:00,081
This is exciting.

1732
01:14:00,351 --> 01:14:01,491
Let's go!

1733
01:14:02,351 --> 01:14:04,561
Ready? Fight!

1734
01:14:17,301 --> 01:14:18,301
(A dolphin appears.)

1735
01:14:18,301 --> 01:14:19,301
Good vibe.

1736
01:14:19,302 --> 01:14:22,771
- That's your boyfriend!
- Goodness.

1737
01:14:29,611 --> 01:14:31,111
Come on, hottie.

1738
01:14:33,481 --> 01:14:34,481
Goodness!

1739
01:14:38,461 --> 01:14:41,291
(It's amazing!)

1740
01:14:44,731 --> 01:14:47,430
(Listen on Spotify)

1741
01:14:47,431 --> 01:14:50,101
("Ridin'" by Lily, Jiwoo, and Kyujin)

1742
01:14:51,701 --> 01:14:52,801
Crazy!

1743
01:15:02,311 --> 01:15:03,581
Nina is the center.

1744
01:15:10,691 --> 01:15:11,721
They're totally in sync.

1745
01:15:13,921 --> 01:15:15,660
That's a huge scale.

1746
01:15:15,661 --> 01:15:16,791
Yes, girls!

1747
01:15:19,231 --> 01:15:20,661
They lined up well.

1748
01:15:22,231 --> 01:15:24,001
(This is it.)

1749
01:15:28,971 --> 01:15:30,171
Go, Bella!

1750
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:36,781
(Standing ovation)

1751
01:15:37,111 --> 01:15:38,251
(Smiling)

1752
01:15:47,621 --> 01:15:48,631
(Feeling shy)

1753
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:50,461
(Me too!)

1754
01:15:54,931 --> 01:15:56,900
Kyoka!

1755
01:15:56,901 --> 01:15:58,771
Kyoka looks cool!

1756
01:16:08,651 --> 01:16:09,881
Goodness!

1757
01:16:18,661 --> 01:16:21,431
(They're shocked.)

1758
01:16:21,531 --> 01:16:23,731
Work! Good job!

1759
01:16:26,401 --> 01:16:29,471
Three, two, one.

1760
01:16:30,371 --> 01:16:33,641
(Please let it be us.)

1761
01:16:34,141 --> 01:16:35,641
It's the next one.

1762
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:38,811
I looked forward to getting the Director's cut.

1763
01:16:39,311 --> 01:16:42,211
Three, two, one.

1764
01:16:43,051 --> 01:16:44,450

1765
01:16:44,451 --> 01:16:45,851
(for the middle class.)

1766
01:16:46,281 --> 01:16:48,021
(We did it!)

1767
01:16:48,291 --> 01:16:50,251
(We got it!)

1768
01:16:50,921 --> 01:16:52,121
It's Ojo Gang.

1769
01:16:53,521 --> 01:16:55,330
(Disappointed)

1770
01:16:55,331 --> 01:17:01,231
(Director's Cut: Ojo Gang Ruu, Minami, Hana, Kyoka)

Goodness!

01:17:08,941 --> 01:17:11,581
Take us to a different wicked world, yes!

1773
01:17:18,751 --> 01:17:20,081
Let's go!

1775
01:17:29,361 --> 01:17:31,131
Let's go, Fantaye!

1776
01:17:40,201 --> 01:17:41,741
(They nailed it!)

1777
01:17:46,511 --> 01:17:47,640
Epic!

1778
01:17:47,641 --> 01:17:49,781
(It'll be a legend.)

1779
01:18:05,331 --> 01:18:07,961
Awesome! Oh, my gosh.

1780
01:18:08,171 --> 01:18:09,370
What the heck?

1781
01:18:09,371 --> 01:18:10,630
(Period!)

1782
01:18:10,631 --> 01:18:11,670
Congratulations!

1783
01:18:11,671 --> 01:18:13,701
We did it!

1784
01:18:13,901 --> 01:18:15,781
(Fight Judges Evaluation for the Class Mission)

1785
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:16,941
(Standing ovation)

1786
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:18,180
Let's go.

1787
01:18:18,181 --> 01:18:19,880
(Amazing quality)

1788
01:18:19,881 --> 01:18:21,851
Experience does matter.

1789
01:18:22,251 --> 01:18:24,710
The fact that ROYAL FAMILY is known to do this.

1790
01:18:24,711 --> 01:18:26,280
They do this.

1791
01:18:26,281 --> 01:18:27,550
They know how to do this.

1792
01:18:27,551 --> 01:18:29,691
They know how this thing should look like.

1793
01:18:29,921 --> 01:18:32,361
Especially the rope choreography at the end,

1794
01:18:32,621 --> 01:18:34,561
that just put the nail in the coffin to me.

1795
01:18:36,131 --> 01:18:38,431
I think nothing was missed. I have no notes.

1796
01:18:38,831 --> 01:18:40,200
I have nothing to say.

1797
01:18:40,201 --> 01:18:42,930
- That was so good.
- Well done.

1798
01:18:42,931 --> 01:18:44,730
We did it.

1799
01:18:44,731 --> 01:18:46,640
(Getting emotional)

1800
01:18:46,641 --> 01:18:47,770
Don't cry.

1801
01:18:47,771 --> 01:18:49,340
Good job, girls.

1802
01:18:49,341 --> 01:18:51,881
You guys shine in that. Good job.

1803
01:18:52,111 --> 01:18:54,310
You did an amazing job.

1804
01:18:54,311 --> 01:18:56,480
- We worked so hard.
- You did a great job.

1805
01:18:56,481 --> 01:18:58,920
We know we gave it all.

1806
01:18:58,921 --> 01:19:00,650
Even though we weren't chosen,

1807
01:19:00,651 --> 01:19:01,751
I don't have any regrets.

1808
01:19:02,291 --> 01:19:04,920
The crew in the Director's cut of the middle class was...

1809
01:19:04,921 --> 01:19:07,190
OSAKA Ojo Gang.

1810
01:19:07,191 --> 01:19:08,390
Thank you.

1811
01:19:08,391 --> 01:19:09,391
Thank you.

1812
01:19:09,761 --> 01:19:11,860
They were the worst dancer nominees.

1813
01:19:11,861 --> 01:19:14,801
It was so disappointing because ours was good.

1814
01:19:14,871 --> 01:19:16,770
When OSAKA Ojo Gang was selected,

1815
01:19:16,771 --> 01:19:18,570
I wasn't so happy about it.

1816
01:19:18,571 --> 01:19:21,100
Which section was going to fit in...

1817
01:19:21,101 --> 01:19:23,470
with the rest of the video was the base.

1818
01:19:23,471 --> 01:19:25,410
When they do it with the camera,

1819
01:19:25,411 --> 01:19:27,710
Kyoka fights the camera and then...

1820
01:19:27,711 --> 01:19:29,510
pulls on Minami.

1821
01:19:29,511 --> 01:19:31,280
She does the roll-ups.

1822
01:19:31,281 --> 01:19:33,750
It was just a fire. We just loved it.

1823
01:19:33,751 --> 01:19:36,191
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1824
01:19:36,751 --> 01:19:40,161
We were surprised and so happy. Thank you.

1825
01:19:40,791 --> 01:19:43,790
We've been through a lot,

1826
01:19:43,791 --> 01:19:46,260
and we didn't expect it.

1827
01:19:46,261 --> 01:19:47,731
So, we're really happy.

1828
01:19:48,001 --> 01:19:52,400
The directors of the middle class. Isla, Moana, Harmz, and Zari.

1829
01:19:52,401 --> 01:19:54,540
Please choose the worst dancers.

1830
01:19:54,541 --> 01:19:55,741
Turn around.

1831
01:19:56,011 --> 01:19:58,840
I don't think we stood out much.

1832
01:19:58,841 --> 01:19:59,841
Somehow...

1833
01:20:00,411 --> 01:20:03,950
I felt like we could be the worst dancers.

1834
01:20:03,951 --> 01:20:06,580
I was pretty nervous.

1835
01:20:06,581 --> 01:20:10,251
I couldn't really find RHTokyo and BUMSUP...

1836
01:20:10,651 --> 01:20:11,661
throughout the video.

1837
01:20:12,821 --> 01:20:18,160
(Unnoticeable BUMSUP and RHTokyo at the back of the group dance)

1838
01:20:18,161 --> 01:20:20,961
I didn't get a setup for Team Korea.

1839
01:20:21,301 --> 01:20:24,200
Where is RHTokyo? Where is BUMSUP?

1840
01:20:24,201 --> 01:20:27,570
That's the only thing that could've been better.

1841
01:20:27,571 --> 01:20:29,040
We had our idea.

1842
01:20:29,041 --> 01:20:31,710
So, we had people.

1843
01:20:31,711 --> 01:20:34,440
But we also could not come to a decision.

1844
01:20:34,441 --> 01:20:38,050
All four of us see different people and different things.

1845
01:20:38,051 --> 01:20:41,180
Dance-wise, we see BUMSUP is the weakest.

1846
01:20:41,181 --> 01:20:44,390
- Next one. Hyojin Choi.
- Yes.

1847
01:20:44,391 --> 01:20:47,620
In many sections, we were at the back.

1848
01:20:47,621 --> 01:20:50,230
Since we didn't stand out,

1849
01:20:50,231 --> 01:20:52,860
I was worried we might be picked as the worst dancers for the reason.

1850
01:20:52,861 --> 01:20:54,060
They might think we were invisible.

1851
01:20:54,061 --> 01:20:57,171
Performance-wise, we see that MOTIV was the weakest.

1852
01:20:57,271 --> 01:20:59,641
(MOTIV's shooting for the Director's cut)

1853
01:21:00,471 --> 01:21:01,471
(She noticed something.)

1854
01:21:01,472 --> 01:21:03,441
They're not looking at the camera.

1855
01:21:03,711 --> 01:21:05,340
If we go with the strategy,

1856
01:21:05,341 --> 01:21:07,310
we've got 50 points less now.

1857
01:21:07,311 --> 01:21:08,951
AG SQUAD is directly ahead of us.

1858
01:21:09,911 --> 01:21:11,311
ROYAL FAMILY.

1859
01:21:12,351 --> 01:21:15,550
(Losing 50 points after being chosen as the worst dancer by AG SQUAD)

1860
01:21:15,551 --> 01:21:17,767
(Rookie Class Worst Dancer, Maiya and Kylie of ROYAL FAMILY)

1861
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:19,520
- We're coming third right now.
- Yes.

1862
01:21:19,521 --> 01:21:21,420
If we're thinking about playing the game strategically,

1863
01:21:21,421 --> 01:21:23,791
we're on top of the table right now.

1864
01:21:23,931 --> 01:21:28,131
Isla, Moana, Harmz, and Zari of ROYAL FAMILY.

1865
01:21:28,401 --> 01:21:32,201
Please choose the worst dancers of the middle class.

1866
01:21:32,341 --> 01:21:33,971
Okay. So.

1867
01:21:34,441 --> 01:21:36,410
I don't believe it'll be us.

1868
01:21:36,411 --> 01:21:39,480
I don't think we'll be the worst dancers.

1869
01:21:39,481 --> 01:21:41,951
We've chosen it. It is...

1870
01:21:42,851 --> 01:21:44,691
(Who is the worst dancer of the middle class?)

1871
01:21:47,351 --> 01:21:51,621
Isla, Moana, Harmz, and Zari of ROYAL FAMILY.

1872
01:21:51,891 --> 01:21:55,661
Please choose the worst dancers of the middle class.

1873
01:21:55,861 --> 01:21:57,431
Okay. So.

1874
01:21:57,931 --> 01:21:59,900
I don't believe it'll be us.

1875
01:21:59,901 --> 01:22:03,000
I don't think we'll be the worst dancers.

1876
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:05,500
We've chosen it based on strategy.

1877
01:22:05,501 --> 01:22:06,741
So, it's AG SQUAD.

1878
01:22:07,101 --> 01:22:08,411
So, it's AG SQUAD.

1879
01:22:09,641 --> 01:22:10,921
- I knew it would happen.
- Yes.

1880
01:22:14,311 --> 01:22:15,481
I saw that coming.

1881
01:22:16,081 --> 01:22:19,581
Now, we're second equal.

1882
01:22:20,021 --> 01:22:23,790
I feel like AG SQUAD just made it easy for us to do.

1883
01:22:23,791 --> 01:22:24,791
Yes, that's right.

1884
01:22:24,792 --> 01:22:28,430
We can say that it was so helpful during the whole process.

1885
01:22:28,431 --> 01:22:31,130
It's just that when you call us, we're going to call you.

1886
01:22:31,131 --> 01:22:33,360
Actually, I like to say that.

1887
01:22:33,361 --> 01:22:36,130
They're going to think about it strategically.

1888
01:22:36,131 --> 01:22:38,640
If they take our points, we take their points.

1889
01:22:38,641 --> 01:22:39,740
So it all comes down to the...

1890
01:22:39,741 --> 01:22:41,270
Yes. So, we're even now.

1891
01:22:41,271 --> 01:22:44,840
So, the biggest weakness of the class,

1892
01:22:44,841 --> 01:22:47,841
the worst dancers, is from AG SQUAD.

1893
01:22:49,011 --> 01:22:53,381
Alysha, Kaleece, Kyra, and Ruthy Baby.

1894
01:22:53,621 --> 01:22:56,751
Why do you think you're chosen as the worst dancers?

1895
01:22:57,191 --> 01:22:58,760
Like she said, it's a strategy.

1896
01:22:58,761 --> 01:23:00,291
We'll take it on the chin.

1897
01:23:00,621 --> 01:23:01,830
Why did you choose us?

1898
01:23:01,831 --> 01:23:05,260
You knew you would lose 50 points.

1899
01:23:05,261 --> 01:23:06,261
Are they upset?

1900
01:23:06,262 --> 01:23:07,361
(Yes)

1901
01:23:07,461 --> 01:23:08,931
It's quite interesting.

1902
01:23:09,931 --> 01:23:10,931
It's scary.

1903
01:23:11,071 --> 01:23:12,870
(Finally, here it is. The best quality ever.)

1904
01:23:12,871 --> 01:23:13,871
(Leader class dance video)

1905
01:23:13,872 --> 01:23:16,141
Oh, my gosh.

1906
01:23:16,811 --> 01:23:18,880
(Who will be the main director's choice...)

1907
01:23:18,881 --> 01:23:21,680
(to feature in the Director's cut?)

1908
01:23:21,681 --> 01:23:24,180
(I can't believe what I saw.)

1909
01:23:24,181 --> 01:23:25,250
(And)

1910
01:23:25,251 --> 01:23:27,450
The worst dancer I chose...

1911
01:23:27,451 --> 01:23:28,521
I was angry.

1912
01:23:28,691 --> 01:23:30,450
I felt like we did our best.

1913
01:23:30,451 --> 01:23:33,121
Actually, I don't think it was reasonable.

1914
01:23:33,321 --> 01:23:35,431
I'll beat them all.

1915
01:23:35,961 --> 01:23:37,360
K-pop mission?

1916
01:23:37,361 --> 01:23:38,960
That's my expertise.

1917
01:23:38,961 --> 01:23:40,430
We'll win this by all means.

1918
01:23:40,431 --> 01:23:41,870
We have many choreographers for K-pop.

1919
01:23:41,871 --> 01:23:43,470
If you guys are good dancers,

1920
01:23:43,471 --> 01:23:44,471
we can make it.

1921
01:23:44,472 --> 01:23:46,070
If you have to copy it exactly,

1922
01:23:46,071 --> 01:23:47,541
you have to be a B-girl.

1923
01:23:47,841 --> 01:23:50,971
We're able to execute just as well as you girls.

1924
01:23:51,211 --> 01:23:53,681
It's doable, but we don't know if you'd execute.

1925
01:23:53,911 --> 01:23:58,181
Lastly, we'll watch the dance video of the leader class.

1926
01:23:58,551 --> 01:23:59,651
Rie Hata!

1927
01:24:00,021 --> 01:24:01,350
I can't wait!

1928
01:24:01,351 --> 01:24:02,691
Let's go!

1929
01:24:02,951 --> 01:24:04,650
I've been waiting for it.

1930
01:24:04,651 --> 01:24:06,561
I hope you'll like it.

1931
01:24:06,821 --> 01:24:08,590
Come on, Marlee. Get that Director's cut.

1932
01:24:08,591 --> 01:24:09,990
Oh, my gosh.

1933
01:24:09,991 --> 01:24:10,991
(I'm nervous.)

1934
01:24:11,731 --> 01:24:13,100
We'll definitely get this.

1935
01:24:13,101 --> 01:24:14,230
It'll be her.

1936
01:24:14,231 --> 01:24:17,101
I feel like it's between me and Teesha for the Director's cut.

1937
01:24:17,601 --> 01:24:19,040
My expectations are really high.

1938
01:24:19,041 --> 01:24:20,671
And this is the leader class.

1939
01:24:20,901 --> 01:24:22,370
This is the only video...

1940
01:24:22,371 --> 01:24:23,910
where the director and the choreographer

1941
01:24:23,911 --> 01:24:25,481
are the same person.

1942
01:24:26,011 --> 01:24:29,550
So, she knows exactly how it should look...

1943
01:24:29,551 --> 01:24:31,410
- and how it should feel.
- Yes.

1944
01:24:31,411 --> 01:24:34,051
That's the difference compared to the other two videos.

1945
01:24:34,251 --> 01:24:36,020
Street Woman Fighter is...

1946
01:24:36,021 --> 01:24:39,560
a survival competition that is only for females.

1947
01:24:39,561 --> 01:24:41,930
So, I wanted to show...

1948
01:24:41,931 --> 01:24:44,331
how cool, controlled, classy,

1949
01:24:44,431 --> 01:24:47,801
and fantastic we are in the leader class dance video.

1950
01:24:48,531 --> 01:24:50,531
It might feel totally different from other videos.

1951
01:24:52,441 --> 01:24:53,640
(The first day of rehearsal for the leader class)

1952
01:24:53,641 --> 01:24:55,161
(Rehearsal of a teacher and a student)

1953
01:24:55,711 --> 01:24:58,341
- You're working hard.
- Ibuki. You came first.

1954
01:24:58,711 --> 01:25:01,240
I was trying to avoid being picked as the worst dancer.

1955
01:25:01,241 --> 01:25:02,910
If I were Rie Hata,

1956
01:25:02,911 --> 01:25:04,651
I'd choose me as the worst dancer.

1957
01:25:04,851 --> 01:25:06,780
My team is the only one...

1958
01:25:06,781 --> 01:25:09,350
that keeps attacking RHTokyo.

1959
01:25:09,351 --> 01:25:11,990
They might still be...

1960
01:25:11,991 --> 01:25:13,691
like students around the teacher.

1961
01:25:14,191 --> 01:25:15,890
Rie Hata will overpower them.

1962
01:25:15,891 --> 01:25:17,230
(RHTokyo and OSAKA Ojo Gang are competing from the beginning.)

1963
01:25:17,231 --> 01:25:19,130
The crew that we, OSAKA Ojo Gang,

1964
01:25:19,131 --> 01:25:22,901
will defeat in a Double loss...

1965
01:25:23,301 --> 01:25:24,631
is Team Japan, RHTokyo.

1966
01:25:24,701 --> 01:25:25,940
(Why did I do that back then?)

1967
01:25:25,941 --> 01:25:27,100
(Laughing)

1968
01:25:27,101 --> 01:25:29,710
Since Rie Hata became the main dancer,

1969
01:25:29,711 --> 01:25:32,110
it was clear what our positions were.

1970
01:25:32,111 --> 01:25:33,780
Rie Hata became my teacher.

1971
01:25:33,781 --> 01:25:35,711
I became a student.

1972
01:25:36,081 --> 01:25:37,950
I'm scared. I can understand...

1973
01:25:37,951 --> 01:25:39,820
why Gabee gave you two sets of eyelashes.

1974
01:25:39,821 --> 01:25:41,921
I don't want to be the worst dancer.

1975
01:25:42,291 --> 01:25:45,620
I believe Rie Hata plays fairly,

1976
01:25:45,621 --> 01:25:48,261
so I'll be fine as long as I do my part well.

1977
01:25:48,561 --> 01:25:50,590
We're using a conveyor belt.

1978
01:25:50,591 --> 01:25:52,130
It's cool!

1979
01:25:52,131 --> 01:25:53,630
(Ibuki reacts to Rie Hata actively.)

1980
01:25:53,631 --> 01:25:55,330
- I love it.
- Yes.

1981
01:25:55,331 --> 01:25:56,370
It looks amazing.

1982
01:25:56,371 --> 01:25:58,901
Everyone gave her a lot of compliments.

1983
01:25:59,001 --> 01:26:00,500
Did you create the whole thing?

1984
01:26:00,501 --> 01:26:01,670
Yes.

1985
01:26:01,671 --> 01:26:04,140
I like the house idea.

1986
01:26:04,141 --> 01:26:05,610
It's really cool.

1987
01:26:05,611 --> 01:26:08,410
It's personal. It's nice.

1988
01:26:08,411 --> 01:26:11,172
I could give her good compliments if I didn't struggle with language.

1989
01:26:11,481 --> 01:26:13,021
I should just focus on my performance.

1990
01:26:13,221 --> 01:26:15,490
And don't move your left hand.

1991
01:26:15,491 --> 01:26:17,720
(Ibuki asks questions in Japanese.)

1992
01:26:17,721 --> 01:26:20,290
(Honey J can't catch up on them.)

1993
01:26:20,291 --> 01:26:22,230
There is a slight delay in interpretation.

1994
01:26:22,231 --> 01:26:25,530
Asking something and interpreting it.

1995
01:26:25,531 --> 01:26:28,300
Whenever I do that, I end up causing delays.

1996
01:26:28,301 --> 01:26:29,930
It could make me look bad,

1997
01:26:29,931 --> 01:26:31,301
so I said nothing.

1998
01:26:31,571 --> 01:26:33,000
I'm in the front, and one, two, three.

1999
01:26:33,001 --> 01:26:36,510
I started missing a few things that she explained.

2000
01:26:36,511 --> 01:26:38,240
(Learning it quickly)

2001
01:26:38,241 --> 01:26:40,341
I felt like I moved half a beat slower than others.

2002
01:26:40,741 --> 01:26:42,981
Five, six, seven, eight.

2003
01:26:43,181 --> 01:26:46,320
The one who took a long time to learn the choreography was...

2004
01:26:46,321 --> 01:26:47,380
Honey J.

2005
01:26:47,381 --> 01:26:48,920
Ibuki also...

2006
01:26:48,921 --> 01:26:51,921
lacks power compared to other leaders.

2007
01:26:54,491 --> 01:26:56,990
(Watching the formation during the practice)

2008
01:26:56,991 --> 01:26:59,530
Maybe switch?

2009
01:26:59,531 --> 01:27:02,101
(Ibuki and Honey J are pushed to the back.)

2010
01:27:02,201 --> 01:27:05,401
My circumstances are none of Rie Hata's business.

2011
01:27:05,571 --> 01:27:09,440
She might think I'm not enthusiastic at all.

2012
01:27:09,441 --> 01:27:11,170
(Honey J practices alone even on a break.)

2013
01:27:11,171 --> 01:27:12,310
(Communicating in English)

2014
01:27:12,311 --> 01:27:14,540
I can't blame anyone,

2015
01:27:14,541 --> 01:27:16,510
but I feel...

2016
01:27:16,511 --> 01:27:20,551
pitiful in that situation.

2017
01:27:20,721 --> 01:27:23,420
To avoid becoming the worst dancer,

2018
01:27:23,421 --> 01:27:26,491
I'll have to win the director's favor.

2019
01:27:26,591 --> 01:27:28,190
(The second day of leader class practice)

2020
01:27:28,191 --> 01:27:29,660
(Honey J arrives early.)

2021
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:32,700
I arrived an hour earlier than the time we agreed to meet.

2022
01:27:32,701 --> 01:27:33,930
I have to do my best.

2023
01:27:33,931 --> 01:27:35,300
(A suspicious piece of paper)

2024
01:27:35,301 --> 01:27:36,770
What is this?

2025
01:27:36,771 --> 01:27:38,430
(Honey J became the worst dancer nominee.)

2026
01:27:38,431 --> 01:27:40,400
It felt like a confirmation.

2027
01:27:40,401 --> 01:27:43,470
Even if it were me, I'd have chosen myself yesterday.

2028
01:27:43,471 --> 01:27:46,010
I was discouraged because I wasn't able to communicate in English.

2029
01:27:46,011 --> 01:27:48,040
But that's my story.

2030
01:27:48,041 --> 01:27:49,650
When creating a performance,

2031
01:27:49,651 --> 01:27:52,721
personal emotions must be excluded.

2032
01:27:52,781 --> 01:27:55,491
I should be more enthusiastic today.

2033
01:27:55,791 --> 01:27:58,290
(Ibuki also spots the same piece of paper in her Agit.)

2034
01:27:58,291 --> 01:28:00,091
(Ibuki also became the worst dancer nominee.)

2035
01:28:00,821 --> 01:28:03,330
(Ripping immediately)

2036
01:28:03,331 --> 01:28:04,660
(No more kind Ibuki)

2037
01:28:04,661 --> 01:28:06,960
I tried my best, but it didn't work.

2038
01:28:06,961 --> 01:28:09,000
It's easy to come up with reasons...

2039
01:28:09,001 --> 01:28:10,230
to make me the worst dancer.

2040
01:28:10,231 --> 01:28:11,400
(Worst dancer nominee 1, worst dancer nominee 2)

2041
01:28:11,401 --> 01:28:15,511
Everyone thinks I'm not good at hip-hop.

2042
01:28:15,611 --> 01:28:18,880
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

2043
01:28:18,881 --> 01:28:20,311
Catering.

2044
01:28:21,181 --> 01:28:22,650
(Sullen)

2045
01:28:22,651 --> 01:28:25,210
I gave up on being a good student.

2046
01:28:25,211 --> 01:28:27,450
Even if I become the worst dancer,

2047
01:28:27,451 --> 01:28:30,020
I swear I'll stand out the most in the dance video.

2048
01:28:30,021 --> 01:28:31,021
(Filled with spite)

2049
01:28:31,022 --> 01:28:34,291
Kaea and Honey J, switch. Honey J...

2050
01:28:34,761 --> 01:28:36,130
Right side of me.

2051
01:28:36,131 --> 01:28:39,001
I can do well even in the back.

2052
01:28:39,131 --> 01:28:41,200
I never know what might happen in the end.

2053
01:28:41,201 --> 01:28:42,431
I'll have to do my best.

2054
01:28:42,571 --> 01:28:44,330
- Rie.
- Yes.

2055
01:28:44,331 --> 01:28:46,441
Can you ask where her formation is?

2056
01:28:47,941 --> 01:28:49,540
- Last?
- Last?

2057
01:28:49,541 --> 01:28:50,640
(Honey J's winning strategy 2)

2058
01:28:50,641 --> 01:28:52,641
(Getting close to her duet partner Kaea)

2059
01:28:53,081 --> 01:28:54,141
Good job.

2060
01:28:54,781 --> 01:28:56,351
- I have a question.
- Yes.

2061
01:28:56,481 --> 01:28:58,550
And then...

2062
01:28:58,551 --> 01:28:59,680
(Honey J's winning strategy 3, studying with Ako)

2063
01:28:59,681 --> 01:29:00,781
- Stop?
- Yes.

2064
01:29:01,321 --> 01:29:02,890
This is the Director's cut.

2065
01:29:02,891 --> 01:29:05,590
I was thinking about moving like this.

2066
01:29:05,591 --> 01:29:07,590
You should use your face a lot.

2067
01:29:07,591 --> 01:29:09,630
- Right?
- If the result is good,

2068
01:29:09,631 --> 01:29:11,360
I'll be able to redeem myself.

2069
01:29:11,361 --> 01:29:12,731
I'll have to do my best tomorrow.

2070
01:29:12,861 --> 01:29:14,907
(Will the worst dancer nominees turn the tables on set?)

2071
01:29:14,931 --> 01:29:16,700
Did you see my camera angle?

2072
01:29:16,701 --> 01:29:18,030
The choreography is like this.

2073
01:29:18,031 --> 01:29:19,571
And I turn the camera.

2074
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:22,340
I hate to be the worst dancer.

2075
01:29:22,341 --> 01:29:24,370
For now, the Director's cut.

2076
01:29:24,371 --> 01:29:25,841
I must get it.

2077
01:29:26,011 --> 01:29:27,640
I need to win for AG SQUAD.

2078
01:29:27,641 --> 01:29:29,380
So I'm not going to get the worst dancer.

2079
01:29:29,381 --> 01:29:31,551
I need to earn that Director's cut.

2080
01:29:32,051 --> 01:29:33,480
(The first Director's cut is Kaea.)

2081
01:29:33,481 --> 01:29:37,190
It was a bit scary because everyone was watching.

2082
01:29:37,191 --> 01:29:39,491
But I'm very used to shooting.

2083
01:29:39,761 --> 01:29:40,960
Five, six.

2084
01:29:40,961 --> 01:29:42,161
(Watching sharply)

2085
01:29:45,531 --> 01:29:47,700
(Satisfied)

2086
01:29:47,701 --> 01:29:50,070
She's done that many times before.

2087
01:29:50,071 --> 01:29:52,900
She knows how to look good.

2088
01:29:52,901 --> 01:29:54,201
I felt confident.

2089
01:29:54,301 --> 01:29:56,541
At the end of the day, she'll pick the best.

2090
01:29:57,341 --> 01:29:58,840
I'm used to having that...

2091
01:29:58,841 --> 01:30:00,780
automatic switch on, just be like,

2092
01:30:00,781 --> 01:30:03,110
"Give it my all and perform to the lens."

2093
01:30:03,111 --> 01:30:05,350
Both Teesha and I are used to it.

2094
01:30:05,351 --> 01:30:07,450
(Director's cut, Teesha)

2095
01:30:07,451 --> 01:30:08,451
Yes.

2096
01:30:08,481 --> 01:30:11,120
Teesha's cut will be very useful.

2097
01:30:11,121 --> 01:30:12,290
Yes!

2098
01:30:12,291 --> 01:30:13,291
(Loving it)

2099
01:30:14,161 --> 01:30:17,360
Everyone seems to focus on their expressions or the mood.

2100
01:30:17,361 --> 01:30:19,660
So I decided to focus on my moves.

2101
01:30:19,661 --> 01:30:21,701
I had a few plans.

2102
01:30:22,731 --> 01:30:24,001
Five, six.

2103
01:30:24,501 --> 01:30:26,400
(Director's cut, Honey J)

2104
01:30:26,401 --> 01:30:27,801
(It's nice.)

2105
01:30:28,601 --> 01:30:30,161
(Honey J changed the last ending pose.)

2106
01:30:32,211 --> 01:30:33,780
I think she might like it.

2107
01:30:33,781 --> 01:30:34,841
Isn't that awesome?

2108
01:30:35,181 --> 01:30:36,880
(Next is Ibuki.)

2109
01:30:36,881 --> 01:30:38,510
I'm not nervous.

2110
01:30:38,511 --> 01:30:40,880
That's the freestyle dancer's strength.

2111
01:30:40,881 --> 01:30:43,401
I only do my best to shine more than others in the dance video.

2112
01:30:45,221 --> 01:30:47,590
(The freestyle dancer's ending)

2113
01:30:47,591 --> 01:30:49,460
(What is that?)

2114
01:30:49,461 --> 01:30:52,700
Raising her leg or showing her skills.

2115
01:30:52,701 --> 01:30:54,900
She put on the best performance.

2116
01:30:54,901 --> 01:30:56,170
(The last Director's cut is Marlee.)

2117
01:30:56,171 --> 01:30:59,770
I was happy that I wasn't the first to go.

2118
01:30:59,771 --> 01:31:03,071
Because I got to see what would look good on camera.

2119
01:31:03,341 --> 01:31:06,911
(Marlee kept monitoring other leaders while waiting.)

2120
01:31:07,011 --> 01:31:09,480
Put your hands forward the camera. It looks better.

2121
01:31:09,481 --> 01:31:11,451
Yes. So good.

2122
01:31:11,611 --> 01:31:14,020
I utilized not only my dance ability,

2123
01:31:14,021 --> 01:31:16,791
but also my understanding of camera work.

2124
01:31:18,251 --> 01:31:19,291
Perfect.

2125
01:31:19,491 --> 01:31:21,420
She seems to have a good sense of space recognition.

2126
01:31:21,421 --> 01:31:24,330
I'm hoping that I will make Director's cut.

2127
01:31:24,331 --> 01:31:27,260
Because I don't want to be the worst dancer.

2128
01:31:27,261 --> 01:31:28,261
(Never)

2129
01:31:28,262 --> 01:31:32,701
I need storytelling eyes, expression, and energy.

2130
01:31:32,941 --> 01:31:34,601
Her and...

2131
01:31:34,701 --> 01:31:35,911
They're neck and neck.

2132
01:31:37,341 --> 01:31:40,140
Which crew got the Director's cut...

2133
01:31:40,141 --> 01:31:43,510
chosen by the leader class director?

2134
01:31:43,511 --> 01:31:46,150
We will now begin evaluating...

2135
01:31:46,151 --> 01:31:48,351
the leader class dance video.

2136
01:31:49,121 --> 01:31:50,391
At your service.

2137
01:31:51,151 --> 01:31:52,421
Show us.

2138
01:31:52,691 --> 01:31:54,891
- I'm so scared.
- BUMSUP.

2139
01:31:55,561 --> 01:31:57,460
Leader, let's go.

2140
01:31:57,461 --> 01:31:58,791
(Let's go.)

2141
01:31:58,901 --> 01:31:59,901
And?

2142
01:32:00,431 --> 01:32:01,531
I'm scared.

2143
01:32:08,871 --> 01:32:10,040
(Listen on Spotify)

2144
01:32:10,041 --> 01:32:12,541
("ECHO!" by HOSHI and WOOZI of SEVENTEEN)

2145
01:32:14,741 --> 01:32:17,680
Give me a story. Give me content.

2146
01:32:17,681 --> 01:32:18,781
(I can feel it.)

2147
01:32:23,721 --> 01:32:25,120
(Go, Kaea.)

2148
01:32:25,121 --> 01:32:26,260
Oh, her hair.

2149
01:32:26,261 --> 01:32:27,721
She looks cool in the office wear.

2150
01:32:28,891 --> 01:32:29,991
Let's go.

2151
01:32:30,731 --> 01:32:31,861
Cute.

2152
01:32:34,831 --> 01:32:36,170
(There's my girl.)

2153
01:32:36,171 --> 01:32:37,771
Honey J's face is fired up.

2154
01:32:48,241 --> 01:32:50,351
- That's me.
- Come on.

2155
01:32:54,081 --> 01:32:56,651
(Make some noise.)

2156
01:32:57,951 --> 01:32:59,160
Let's go.

2157
01:32:59,161 --> 01:33:00,661
(In awe)

2158
01:33:01,361 --> 01:33:02,961
I got chills right now.

2159
01:33:03,531 --> 01:33:05,831
You can't see me in the group shot.

2160
01:33:08,501 --> 01:33:09,571
So cool.

2161
01:33:12,741 --> 01:33:14,101
Come on, Teesha.

2162
01:33:14,441 --> 01:33:16,811
You and Rie are the same.

2163
01:33:18,041 --> 01:33:19,111
What's she doing?

2164
01:33:20,611 --> 01:33:22,751
Cool.

2165
01:33:23,681 --> 01:33:27,121
(Charismatic)

2166
01:33:32,361 --> 01:33:34,961
(Teesha and Ibuki's chemistry)

2167
01:33:41,661 --> 01:33:44,201
- You look sexy.
- That's hot.

2168
01:33:48,071 --> 01:33:49,211
(That's my partner.)

2169
01:33:49,441 --> 01:33:50,441
You ate it up.

2170
01:33:52,341 --> 01:33:54,881
Everyone looks good in the video.

2171
01:33:55,441 --> 01:33:57,280
The office girl theme is a cliche,

2172
01:33:57,281 --> 01:33:58,751
but it's so witty.

2173
01:34:00,381 --> 01:34:01,651
Let's go, Teesha.

2174
01:34:02,751 --> 01:34:04,651
Fire up.

2175
01:34:05,791 --> 01:34:07,061
You nailed it.

2176
01:34:09,431 --> 01:34:11,591
(The moms' chemistry)

2177
01:34:11,761 --> 01:34:12,901
So hot.

2178
01:34:13,831 --> 01:34:15,771
(I love it.)

2179
01:34:16,201 --> 01:34:17,771
(Pause)

2180
01:34:18,001 --> 01:34:19,041
What's she doing?

2181
01:34:22,671 --> 01:34:24,510
The conveyor belt's crazy.

2182
01:34:24,511 --> 01:34:26,181
That was so hard on that.

2183
01:34:26,381 --> 01:34:28,480
Moving on there is crazy.

2184
01:34:28,481 --> 01:34:31,081
- It's a good structure.
- That's nice to watch.

2185
01:34:35,921 --> 01:34:37,790
- Oh, my gosh.
- See that's...

2186
01:34:37,791 --> 01:34:38,851
Levels...

2187
01:34:40,521 --> 01:34:41,691
Let's go, Ibuki.

2188
01:34:44,261 --> 01:34:45,261
Let's go.

2189
01:34:47,001 --> 01:34:48,001
Let's go.

2190
01:34:48,761 --> 01:34:50,201
Let's go, Honey J.

2191
01:34:54,001 --> 01:34:55,540
(3 seconds before the Director's cut)

2192
01:34:55,541 --> 01:34:56,610
(2 seconds before the Director's cut)

2193
01:34:56,611 --> 01:34:57,770
(1 second before the Director's cut)

2194
01:34:57,771 --> 01:34:58,870
It's coming next.

2195
01:34:58,871 --> 01:34:59,980
- After this?
- Yes.

2196
01:34:59,981 --> 01:35:01,480
Okay. It's coming up.

2197
01:35:01,481 --> 01:35:03,610
I feel really confident in what I did.

2198
01:35:03,611 --> 01:35:06,620
I just hope that Rie trusts what I did.

2199
01:35:06,621 --> 01:35:08,920
I ate up the Director's cut.

2200
01:35:08,921 --> 01:35:11,020
So I really hope I do get it.

2201
01:35:11,021 --> 01:35:12,350
I thought I did good.

2202
01:35:12,351 --> 01:35:14,060
I hope I get the Director's cut.

2203
01:35:14,061 --> 01:35:16,191
- It's coming. Please pick me.
- Let's go.

2204
01:35:17,491 --> 01:35:18,860
(3 seconds before the Director's cut)

2205
01:35:18,861 --> 01:35:20,060
(2 seconds before the Director's cut)

2206
01:35:20,061 --> 01:35:21,501
(1 second before the Director's cut)

2207
01:35:21,661 --> 01:35:23,461
(Marlee got the leader class Director's cut.)

2208
01:35:23,571 --> 01:35:26,240
(Really?)

2209
01:35:26,241 --> 01:35:28,101
(That's our leader.)

2210
01:35:28,301 --> 01:35:30,311
It's Marlee.

2211
01:35:30,641 --> 01:35:31,970
Marlee.

2212
01:35:31,971 --> 01:35:33,611
(Bitter)

2213
01:35:33,711 --> 01:35:38,751
(Director's cut, Marlee of MOTIV)

2214
01:35:39,281 --> 01:35:42,151
(I'm so shy.)

2215
01:35:42,251 --> 01:35:43,620
Let's go.

2216
01:35:43,621 --> 01:35:45,791
Let's watch.

2217
01:35:49,961 --> 01:35:52,231
You better throw that paper...

2218
01:35:53,001 --> 01:35:54,100
(Eyes opening wide)

2219
01:35:54,101 --> 01:35:56,101
(Thrilled)

2220
01:36:02,611 --> 01:36:04,441
That's insane.

2221
01:36:09,281 --> 01:36:11,581
That's E for "ECHO!"

2222
01:36:11,651 --> 01:36:13,121
She's a genius.

2223
01:36:14,481 --> 01:36:16,891
I like how there's a lot of dancing.

2224
01:36:17,351 --> 01:36:18,820
It's a great video.

2225
01:36:18,821 --> 01:36:20,621
She did a good job of directing.

2226
01:36:25,661 --> 01:36:27,700
(Cheering)

2227
01:36:27,701 --> 01:36:28,861
That was fine.

2228
01:36:34,641 --> 01:36:35,801
The formation shined.

2229
01:36:36,141 --> 01:36:38,041
- That looks so sweet.
- That was neat.

2230
01:36:38,171 --> 01:36:39,641
That's so cool.

2231
01:36:41,841 --> 01:36:44,711
- Yes.
- Oh, my gosh.

2232
01:36:49,081 --> 01:36:50,851
Not yet.

2233
01:36:53,361 --> 01:36:54,990
- It isn't over yet.
- Is there more?

2234
01:36:54,991 --> 01:36:55,991
It isn't over yet.

2235
01:36:55,992 --> 01:36:57,231
A post-credits scene.

2236
01:36:59,631 --> 01:37:01,800
- Did you like it?
- Hi.

2237
01:37:01,801 --> 01:37:03,171
- Hi.
- Hi.

2238
01:37:04,671 --> 01:37:06,971
Mom, I'm hungry.

2239
01:37:12,411 --> 01:37:14,781
It's tteokbokki and kimbap.

2240
01:37:18,111 --> 01:37:19,520
- We'll enjoy the food.
- They look tasty.

2241
01:37:19,521 --> 01:37:21,181
Kimbap and tteokbokki.

2242
01:37:22,051 --> 01:37:23,420
- Hey.
- They're so tasty.

2243
01:37:23,421 --> 01:37:26,091
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

2244
01:37:26,861 --> 01:37:28,560
(Listen to "ECHO!" by HOSHI and WOOZI of SEVENTEEN, )

2245
01:37:28,561 --> 01:37:30,291
(produced by WOOZI on Spotify.)

2246
01:37:31,591 --> 01:37:34,101
It was absolutely insane.

2247
01:37:34,261 --> 01:37:35,531
It was like a movie.

2248
01:37:35,731 --> 01:37:37,070
I loved how it was like...

2249
01:37:37,071 --> 01:37:38,330
- storytelling.
- Yes.

2250
01:37:38,331 --> 01:37:40,340
It was like we were watching a movie.

2251
01:37:40,341 --> 01:37:42,810
But then, when she gives us the food, the paper is...

2252
01:37:42,811 --> 01:37:43,811
from that movie.

2253
01:37:44,011 --> 01:37:45,471
- "Inception." - "Inception."

2254
01:37:46,781 --> 01:37:48,741
She made sure each member shone.

2255
01:37:49,751 --> 01:37:51,481
How cool. The leaders don't disappoint.

2256
01:37:52,111 --> 01:37:53,680
(Throwing)

2257
01:37:53,681 --> 01:37:56,750
We're done! Done!

2258
01:37:56,751 --> 01:37:58,621
Really?

2259
01:38:01,661 --> 01:38:04,561
All from one brain, though? One brain?

2260
01:38:04,891 --> 01:38:06,730
Choreography and directing?

2261
01:38:06,731 --> 01:38:08,131
This was her chance to be like,

2262
01:38:08,231 --> 01:38:09,531
"I'm the artist."

2263
01:38:09,871 --> 01:38:11,801
"All of this energy that I have,"

2264
01:38:11,901 --> 01:38:14,701
"that I give to every other artist..."

2265
01:38:15,001 --> 01:38:16,040
"This is my time."

2266
01:38:16,041 --> 01:38:17,111
"Give me one chance."

2267
01:38:17,441 --> 01:38:19,341
The opportunity that was at hand...

2268
01:38:19,441 --> 01:38:21,211
- You didn't take it for granted.
- Yes.

2269
01:38:21,411 --> 01:38:24,381
And you have the skills to make it happen.

2270
01:38:25,211 --> 01:38:28,021
Director Rie Hata of RHTokyo,

2271
01:38:28,081 --> 01:38:30,321
please decide on the worst dancer.

2272
01:38:31,921 --> 01:38:32,921
What do you think?

2273
01:38:33,491 --> 01:38:34,691
Who caught your eye?

2274
01:38:35,321 --> 01:38:36,391
It's not going to be you.

2275
01:38:36,991 --> 01:38:38,361
- I hope not.
- It shouldn't be.

2276
01:38:39,161 --> 01:38:40,301
Maybe Ibuki.

2277
01:38:40,661 --> 01:38:42,001
It wasn't her style.

2278
01:38:42,731 --> 01:38:44,970
Strategically, a Japanese crew...

2279
01:38:44,971 --> 01:38:46,571
will want the other Japanese crew to go.

2280
01:38:47,001 --> 01:38:48,401
Let's see.

2281
01:38:49,941 --> 01:38:51,741
Ibuki and Honey J.

2282
01:38:52,171 --> 01:38:53,641
Maybe Honey J.

2283
01:38:54,341 --> 01:38:55,381
You're nervous, right?

2284
01:38:57,251 --> 01:38:58,251
Right?

2285
01:38:59,281 --> 01:39:02,181
Marlee did really well this time.

2286
01:39:02,721 --> 01:39:04,001
The facial expressions and such.

2287
01:39:04,321 --> 01:39:08,291
There was a possibility of changing my decision,

2288
01:39:08,391 --> 01:39:10,361
but other leaders stood out so much.

2289
01:39:10,461 --> 01:39:12,591
Compared to them, she had fewer eye-catching scenes.

2290
01:39:13,731 --> 01:39:14,830
Everyone did well.

2291
01:39:14,831 --> 01:39:16,171
She didn't stand out.

2292
01:39:17,801 --> 01:39:22,041
Well, each dancer's level was so high...

2293
01:39:23,141 --> 01:39:26,811
that I expected everyone to do more than her usual best.

2294
01:39:27,341 --> 01:39:30,451
I wish she had more power.

2295
01:39:31,011 --> 01:39:32,651
The one I chose as the worst dancer is...

2296
01:39:33,021 --> 01:39:34,021
Please.

2297
01:39:34,581 --> 01:39:35,621
I'm scared.

2298
01:39:36,851 --> 01:39:38,890
BUMSUP's Honey J.

2299
01:39:38,891 --> 01:39:42,120
(The leader class's worst dancer, BUMSUP's Honey J)

2300
01:39:42,121 --> 01:39:43,191
Oh, no.

2301
01:39:45,691 --> 01:39:47,760
- Oh, no.
- It sucks because...

2302
01:39:47,761 --> 01:39:49,101
they don't have any points.

2303
01:39:50,071 --> 01:39:51,101
It's cruel.

2304
01:39:52,901 --> 01:39:54,341
What an interesting woman.

2305
01:39:54,441 --> 01:39:55,701
You were the coolest.

2306
01:39:56,341 --> 01:39:57,811
She's talented but interesting.

2307
01:39:59,071 --> 01:40:01,481
Due to the language barrier,

2308
01:40:01,581 --> 01:40:05,981
Honey J must've struggled more than anyone in the group.

2309
01:40:06,851 --> 01:40:09,521
Despite that, she competes with her dance skills.

2310
01:40:09,691 --> 01:40:13,861
Honey J could've made herself shine more than the other five...

2311
01:40:14,021 --> 01:40:15,790
with her dance skills...

2312
01:40:15,791 --> 01:40:17,561
as well as her aura and sense of presence.

2313
01:40:18,061 --> 01:40:22,261
So I honestly think that she could've shown...

2314
01:40:22,361 --> 01:40:24,531
more power.

2315
01:40:25,501 --> 01:40:28,701
Well, my situation can't be an excuse.

2316
01:40:28,901 --> 01:40:31,511
Even if I say that I truly did my best...

2317
01:40:31,771 --> 01:40:35,411
I don't have anything more to say if it appeared that way.

2318
01:40:37,881 --> 01:40:39,310
(Honey J suddenly stops.)

2319
01:40:39,311 --> 01:40:40,721
No. Smile.

2320
01:40:41,981 --> 01:40:42,991
Smile.

2321
01:40:44,721 --> 01:40:46,161
You can cry. What's the big deal?

2322
01:40:46,361 --> 01:40:48,391
- Just cry.
- It's okay to cry.

2323
01:40:53,231 --> 01:40:57,801
(She can't suppress her tears due to the overflowing emotions.)

2324
01:40:58,031 --> 01:40:59,301
Oh, man.

2325
01:41:00,841 --> 01:41:01,901
I'm close to tears too.

2326
01:41:02,871 --> 01:41:06,681
Honey J probably worked as diligently as I did.

2327
01:41:10,811 --> 01:41:12,651
You must be upset since you've worked so hard.

2328
01:41:12,951 --> 01:41:16,190
It isn't about being chosen as the worst dancer.

2329
01:41:16,191 --> 01:41:19,351
During this process, you felt...

2330
01:41:19,721 --> 01:41:21,290
a sense of loneliness.

2331
01:41:21,291 --> 01:41:24,990
I made so much effort to keep my energy level up...

2332
01:41:24,991 --> 01:41:26,601
and work with them.

2333
01:41:26,761 --> 01:41:28,531
I continued to feel bad.

2334
01:41:30,271 --> 01:41:32,630
The worst dancers of the three classes...

2335
01:41:32,631 --> 01:41:34,401
have been decided.

2336
01:41:34,941 --> 01:41:36,841
The rookie class's worst dancers...

2337
01:41:37,241 --> 01:41:40,441
are ROYAL FAMILY's Maiya and Kylie.

2338
01:41:40,941 --> 01:41:43,081
The middle class's worst dancers...

2339
01:41:43,351 --> 01:41:46,321
are AG SQUAD's Alysha, Kyra,

2340
01:41:46,451 --> 01:41:48,121
Ruthy Baby, and Kaleece.

2341
01:41:48,751 --> 01:41:50,751
The leader class's worst dancer...

2342
01:41:50,851 --> 01:41:54,191
is BUMSUP's Honey J.

2343
01:41:54,491 --> 01:41:56,761
- We made it out alive.
- We did it.

2344
01:41:57,561 --> 01:41:58,631
It's cruel.

2345
01:41:59,631 --> 01:42:01,931
For the rookie class and the middle class,

2346
01:42:02,031 --> 01:42:03,571
there are 2 or 4 members.

2347
01:42:04,001 --> 01:42:06,161
So the focus isn't on an individual dancer's skills...

2348
01:42:06,371 --> 01:42:08,501
since teamwork is important.

2349
01:42:08,841 --> 01:42:11,041
But for the leader class, there is one member.

2350
01:42:11,341 --> 01:42:12,901
Getting picked would cause more damage.

2351
01:42:14,011 --> 01:42:16,141
Each class's worst dancer...

2352
01:42:16,511 --> 01:42:19,650
brought minus 50 points...

2353
01:42:19,651 --> 01:42:21,521
and gave the crew a fatal blow.

2354
01:42:24,591 --> 01:42:26,721
We're at the very bottom in terms of the score.

2355
01:42:27,021 --> 01:42:28,291
Of course, I'm angry.

2356
01:42:28,891 --> 01:42:30,231
We lost 50 points.

2357
01:42:30,331 --> 01:42:32,261
It's really sad and heartbreaking.

2358
01:42:32,961 --> 01:42:35,631
I did feel a bit bad for our crew.

2359
01:42:36,201 --> 01:42:39,071
RHTokyo currently has 100 points.

2360
01:42:40,201 --> 01:42:41,371
No points have been deducted.

2361
01:42:43,241 --> 01:42:45,941
However, the match isn't over.

2362
01:42:46,311 --> 01:42:49,081
You can get ahead of this competition...

2363
01:42:49,341 --> 01:42:51,611
by getting picked as the best director.

2364
01:42:51,911 --> 01:42:53,321
Yes. Let's go.

2365
01:42:53,681 --> 01:42:55,351
Who will it be?

2366
01:42:55,751 --> 01:42:58,550
The best director will receive a strong benefit...

2367
01:42:58,551 --> 01:43:00,721
that'll help the crew begin the next mission...

2368
01:43:01,021 --> 01:43:03,431
with an advantage.

2369
01:43:04,131 --> 01:43:05,361
We have minus points.

2370
01:43:05,761 --> 01:43:09,701
So Vanessa and I want to have an upper hand of power.

2371
01:43:09,831 --> 01:43:11,871
RHTokyo is so ahead right now.

2372
01:43:11,931 --> 01:43:13,601
So I want to win that.

2373
01:43:14,471 --> 01:43:16,771
Among the three classes,

2374
01:43:17,071 --> 01:43:20,381
which class will win the best director?

2375
01:43:20,741 --> 01:43:22,081
I'd pick AG SQUAD.

2376
01:43:22,181 --> 01:43:23,311
This is ours.

2377
01:43:23,551 --> 01:43:25,310
The best director of the Class Mission...

2378
01:43:25,311 --> 01:43:27,521
that was chosen by the fight judges is...

2379
01:43:28,451 --> 01:43:29,451
Now?

2380
01:43:30,021 --> 01:43:31,301
(RHTokyo members come together.)

2381
01:43:31,751 --> 01:43:33,761
Let's go, ladies.

2382
01:43:34,121 --> 01:43:35,821
- Go, ladies.
- Who will it be?

2383
01:43:36,221 --> 01:43:37,831
Who is it going to be?

2384
01:43:38,161 --> 01:43:40,001
It'll be annoying if it isn't Rie Hata.

2385
01:43:40,931 --> 01:43:42,971
- Please.
- Please.

2386
01:43:43,231 --> 01:43:44,270
I'm scared.

2387
01:43:44,271 --> 01:43:45,771
I'm so nervous.

2388
01:43:45,871 --> 01:43:49,300
The best director is the leader class's main dancer,

2389
01:43:49,301 --> 01:43:51,210
RHTokyo's Rie Hata.

2390
01:43:51,211 --> 01:43:53,781
(The best director, RHTokyo's Rie Hata)

2391
01:43:54,181 --> 01:43:55,811
(The best director, RHTokyo's Rie Hata)

2392
01:43:55,911 --> 01:43:56,981
Rie Hata.

2393
01:43:58,481 --> 01:43:59,481
Well done.

2394
01:44:00,421 --> 01:44:01,751
This video right here?

2395
01:44:01,851 --> 01:44:03,821
- It's just a piece of art.
- Art.

2396
01:44:04,451 --> 01:44:07,321
All from one brain, though? One brain?

2397
01:44:07,691 --> 01:44:09,521
Choreography and directing?

2398
01:44:09,631 --> 01:44:13,231
Rie really made all of the leaders...

2399
01:44:13,331 --> 01:44:15,061
look like superstars.

2400
01:44:15,531 --> 01:44:18,671
I feel like Rie really just represented...

2401
01:44:18,771 --> 01:44:21,370
all the choreographers in the world to be like, "Hey,"

2402
01:44:21,371 --> 01:44:23,411
"this is what choreography is."

2403
01:44:23,971 --> 01:44:26,311
It's not just making dance moves.

2404
01:44:26,411 --> 01:44:29,041
Choreographers are directors.

2405
01:44:29,681 --> 01:44:32,051
(Enjoying happiness)

2406
01:44:32,251 --> 01:44:35,481
We all have that dream to create these high-level videos.

2407
01:44:35,781 --> 01:44:37,421
She had a chance. She proved it.

2408
01:44:37,591 --> 01:44:41,261
We had no need for any discussions or debate.

2409
01:44:42,091 --> 01:44:44,461
She was unanimously selected.

2410
01:44:44,831 --> 01:44:45,860
Thank you.

2411
01:44:45,861 --> 01:44:47,661
The moment my name got called,

2412
01:44:47,761 --> 01:44:52,231
I could feel that I received recognition.

2413
01:44:52,401 --> 01:44:53,871
I'm in a good mood.

2414
01:44:56,101 --> 01:44:58,101
Okay. Next time, we're going to take their points.

2415
01:44:58,211 --> 01:45:00,441
Do I agree? I don't know.

2416
01:45:00,541 --> 01:45:02,280
She had the creativity.

2417
01:45:02,281 --> 01:45:04,581
But I feel like we had on her.

2418
01:45:04,711 --> 01:45:07,250
I don't think there's any point in being, like,

2419
01:45:07,251 --> 01:45:10,521
discouraged or upset about not getting the best director.

2420
01:45:10,621 --> 01:45:12,520
The advantage is a plus,

2421
01:45:12,521 --> 01:45:14,791
so we just want to, like, move forward from that.

2422
01:45:15,491 --> 01:45:17,261
As a result of the Class Mission,

2423
01:45:17,431 --> 01:45:20,460
BUMSUP took the heavy burden...

2424
01:45:20,461 --> 01:45:22,401
of losing 50 points.

2425
01:45:22,861 --> 01:45:26,271
RHTokyo pulled themselves to a higher place...

2426
01:45:26,371 --> 01:45:29,471
by winning 100 points.

2427
01:45:29,811 --> 01:45:32,311
With the new rankings in place,

2428
01:45:32,641 --> 01:45:34,581
each crew must face...

2429
01:45:34,641 --> 01:45:37,051
the next mission for survival.

2430
01:45:37,781 --> 01:45:39,151
After this mission,

2431
01:45:39,721 --> 01:45:42,680
we'll have the first crew to be eliminated...

2432
01:45:42,681 --> 01:45:44,001
on World of Street Woman Fighter.

2433
01:45:44,121 --> 01:45:45,550
(Already?)

2434
01:45:45,551 --> 01:45:46,761
(An elimination?)

2435
01:45:46,861 --> 01:45:50,191
I don't think we'll get eliminated.

2436
01:45:50,291 --> 01:45:52,861
Which crew will it be?

2437
01:45:53,231 --> 01:45:55,701
- We're not going to be eliminated.
- No.

2438
01:45:56,131 --> 01:45:57,231
I didn't feel worried.

2439
01:45:57,331 --> 01:46:00,871
I don't think MOTIV will be on a chopping block for elimination.

2440
01:46:01,241 --> 01:46:04,840
We'll put our pride on the line and protect the crew,

2441
01:46:04,841 --> 01:46:05,971
BUMSUP.

2442
01:46:06,481 --> 01:46:10,051
The next mission that'll decide on the first crew to be eliminated...

2443
01:46:10,551 --> 01:46:12,410
- What could it be?
- What is it?

2444
01:46:12,411 --> 01:46:13,981
Okay. Let's proceed.

2445
01:46:14,421 --> 01:46:16,551
It's the World of K-pop Mission.

2446
01:46:19,021 --> 01:46:20,021
Here it is.

2447
01:46:20,261 --> 01:46:21,721
Of course, it's K-pop.

2448
01:46:22,991 --> 01:46:24,031
It's our mission.

2449
01:46:24,631 --> 01:46:26,701
- We're going to do well in this.
- K-pop.

2450
01:46:27,201 --> 01:46:29,130
Which crew will take...

2451
01:46:29,131 --> 01:46:31,571
a globally acclaimed artist's song...

2452
01:46:31,731 --> 01:46:35,600
and use the most charismatic concept and the most unique idea...

2453
01:46:35,601 --> 01:46:37,441
to complete the performance?

2454
01:46:37,971 --> 01:46:39,371
I have so much confidence.

2455
01:46:39,641 --> 01:46:41,641
I can do an amazing job on this mission.

2456
01:46:41,941 --> 01:46:45,250
We have two dancers who are well-known in the K-pop scene.

2457
01:46:45,251 --> 01:46:46,481
We'll really show them.

2458
01:46:47,281 --> 01:46:48,881
K-pop mission?

2459
01:46:48,981 --> 01:46:50,791
This is my expertise.

2460
01:46:51,551 --> 01:46:53,820
I'm not a dancer from Korea,

2461
01:46:53,821 --> 01:46:55,990
the origin of K-pop,

2462
01:46:55,991 --> 01:46:58,390
but I think I'm good...

2463
01:46:58,391 --> 01:47:01,561
at making cool K-pop choreography.

2464
01:47:02,501 --> 01:47:04,000
And that can feel scary.

2465
01:47:04,001 --> 01:47:06,371
I'm like coming into a new house.

2466
01:47:06,541 --> 01:47:09,140
These other crews are more familiar...

2467
01:47:09,141 --> 01:47:11,340
with dancing to K-pop music.

2468
01:47:11,341 --> 01:47:15,911
In this mission, we're really going to have to prove ourselves.

2469
01:47:16,011 --> 01:47:19,411
I'm nervous, but I'm also confident.

2470
01:47:20,251 --> 01:47:22,621
A head-on battle between countries.

2471
01:47:23,021 --> 01:47:24,950
You will either get eliminated...

2472
01:47:24,951 --> 01:47:27,260
or eliminate the other crew.

2473
01:47:27,261 --> 01:47:29,260
The evaluation for World of K-pop Mission...

2474
01:47:29,261 --> 01:47:31,391
where crews will battle against other crews...

2475
01:47:31,691 --> 01:47:33,430
will be made from the fight judges' evaluation...

2476
01:47:33,431 --> 01:47:37,600
and the global online public evaluation voting.

2477
01:47:37,601 --> 01:47:41,001
The right to choose the song and the matchup...

2478
01:47:41,971 --> 01:47:45,511
will depend on the best director of the class missions.

2479
01:47:45,971 --> 01:47:47,480
(Best director? Me?)

2480
01:47:47,481 --> 01:47:48,511
I get to decide?

2481
01:47:49,241 --> 01:47:53,010
I had the benefit to decide the matchup.

2482
01:47:53,011 --> 01:47:54,781
This was advantageous for us.

2483
01:47:55,721 --> 01:47:57,591
That's a mean advantage.

2484
01:47:57,821 --> 01:47:59,551
Very advantageous.

2485
01:48:00,591 --> 01:48:03,631
The mission song will be revealed.

2486
01:48:03,931 --> 01:48:06,330
(We're curious.)

2487
01:48:06,331 --> 01:48:07,371
I'm looking forward to it.

2488
01:48:07,531 --> 01:48:09,730
The songs.

2489
01:48:09,731 --> 01:48:11,011
I wonder whose songs they'll be.

2490
01:48:12,671 --> 01:48:14,340
The song for the aespa match...

2491
01:48:14,341 --> 01:48:18,541
is "Armageddon" with an explosion of intense beats and power.

2492
01:48:19,041 --> 01:48:21,040
"Armagdddon?" I love that music.

2493
01:48:21,041 --> 01:48:22,740
This is the one.

2494
01:48:22,741 --> 01:48:24,787
(A hip-hop dance song that blends old-school and trendy styles)

2495
01:48:24,811 --> 01:48:26,051
We could eat this song.

2496
01:48:27,881 --> 01:48:30,551
- Drama - I see.

2497
01:48:30,721 --> 01:48:31,821
Very iconic.

2498
01:48:32,051 --> 01:48:34,321
I feel like this is really us. "Drama."

2499
01:48:35,321 --> 01:48:36,360
("Whiplash" by aespa)

2500
01:48:36,361 --> 01:48:37,531
(Moving)

2501
01:48:38,531 --> 01:48:39,531
This is nice.

2502
01:48:39,901 --> 01:48:42,361
I think BUMSUP would do better...

2503
01:48:42,561 --> 01:48:45,530
since they have more experience...

2504
01:48:45,531 --> 01:48:47,171
in creating choreography for girl groups.

2505
01:48:47,441 --> 01:48:48,771
Gabee made this.

2506
01:48:49,371 --> 01:48:51,071
(This is the part.)

2507
01:48:51,311 --> 01:48:52,311
Whiplash

2508
01:48:52,971 --> 01:48:54,610
(Everyone...)

2509
01:48:54,611 --> 01:48:56,281
(does the move.)

2510
01:48:56,411 --> 01:48:57,811
Nice.

2511
01:48:58,011 --> 01:48:59,050
I love them.

2512
01:48:59,051 --> 01:49:00,481
I like all of them.

2513
01:49:00,781 --> 01:49:02,881
I'm not confident in winning this one.

2514
01:49:03,421 --> 01:49:05,020
We could make it with a different concept.

2515
01:49:05,021 --> 01:49:06,050
- It's going to be hard.
- I think it's going to be hard...

2516
01:49:06,051 --> 01:49:07,367
if we think about making something else.

2517
01:49:07,391 --> 01:49:10,390
It's difficult to make something new and something better...

2518
01:49:10,391 --> 01:49:13,800
when it already has a famous choreography.

2519
01:49:13,801 --> 01:49:14,861
I want to avoid them.

2520
01:49:16,131 --> 01:49:17,671
The songs for the JENNIE match...

2521
01:49:18,231 --> 01:49:20,270
(Jennie's fan is shocked.)

2522
01:49:20,271 --> 01:49:22,340
(Here it is.)

2523
01:49:22,341 --> 01:49:23,571
- Okay.
- Okay.

2524
01:49:24,471 --> 01:49:26,171
I know this song. LA.

2525
01:49:26,711 --> 01:49:28,381
No. I might cry.

2526
01:49:29,211 --> 01:49:30,550
But the main choreography...

2527
01:49:30,551 --> 01:49:32,151
- is too strong.
- Right?

2528
01:49:32,351 --> 01:49:33,720
("Like JENNIE" by Jennie)

2529
01:49:33,721 --> 01:49:35,050
(Who wants to rock like Jennie?)

2530
01:49:35,051 --> 01:49:36,890
We'll have it.

2531
01:49:36,891 --> 01:49:38,990
Leejung has to do this.

2532
01:49:38,991 --> 01:49:41,920
I wanted to do "Like JENNIE" in my class.

2533
01:49:41,921 --> 01:49:42,921
Shall we do it?

2534
01:49:43,961 --> 01:49:45,131
Let's do it.

2535
01:49:45,491 --> 01:49:46,491
Amazing.

2536
01:49:46,731 --> 01:49:48,600
This is "ExtraL."

2537
01:49:48,601 --> 01:49:49,700
("ExtraL" by Jennie)

2538
01:49:49,701 --> 01:49:50,830
(Glancing)

2539
01:49:50,831 --> 01:49:52,231
This is extra-large.

2540
01:49:52,701 --> 01:49:54,101
This is for ROYAL FAMILY.

2541
01:49:55,601 --> 01:49:57,011
I love Jennie.

2542
01:49:57,471 --> 01:49:58,771
Jennie's song would be nice.

2543
01:50:00,141 --> 01:50:02,241
This is going to be fun.

2544
01:50:03,451 --> 01:50:04,581
Come on.

2545
01:50:04,951 --> 01:50:06,211
Don't play.

2546
01:50:06,551 --> 01:50:07,821
This is going to be fun.

2547
01:50:08,281 --> 01:50:09,350
I'm looking forward to the last song.

2548
01:50:09,351 --> 01:50:11,591
- The songs for the JENNIE match...
- Let it be hip-hop.

2549
01:50:13,661 --> 01:50:15,360
The songs for the G-DRAGON match...

2550
01:50:15,361 --> 01:50:16,590
(It's G-DRAGON!)

2551
01:50:16,591 --> 01:50:17,861
(Yes, it's hip-hop!)

2552
01:50:18,631 --> 01:50:20,161
This is really nice.

2553
01:50:20,431 --> 01:50:22,201
This is really nice.

2554
01:50:22,761 --> 01:50:23,770
Ready?

2555
01:50:23,771 --> 01:50:24,771
(Are you ready?)

2556
01:50:24,772 --> 01:50:26,101
Ready?

2557
01:50:26,431 --> 01:50:28,700
- I am a good boy - I am a good boy

2558
01:50:28,701 --> 01:50:31,910
Crazy. This is crazy.

2559
01:50:31,911 --> 01:50:33,141
This is going to be good.

2560
01:50:33,341 --> 01:50:34,980
Goodness.

2561
01:50:34,981 --> 01:50:36,281
This is amazing.

2562
01:50:37,011 --> 01:50:38,011
My choreography.

2563
01:50:39,151 --> 01:50:41,421
(Tokyo power)

2564
01:50:41,621 --> 01:50:45,591
I think it would be easier and fun to choose the G-DRAGON match.

2565
01:50:45,851 --> 01:50:47,290
Choose this one!

2566
01:50:47,291 --> 01:50:48,291
(We recommend it!)

2567
01:50:48,991 --> 01:50:51,931
Aiki would be good with this.

2568
01:50:53,331 --> 01:50:56,031
I think Kyoka and Minami go well with this song.

2569
01:50:56,531 --> 01:51:00,000
This is the hardest song so far.

2570
01:51:00,001 --> 01:51:01,001
(I'm excited.)

2571
01:51:01,002 --> 01:51:02,540
I think aespa's songs would be better...

2572
01:51:02,541 --> 01:51:04,341
if you want it to be more K-pop.

2573
01:51:05,811 --> 01:51:06,971
But would they give it to us?

2574
01:51:09,011 --> 01:51:10,750
One of the two crews...

2575
01:51:10,751 --> 01:51:13,150
will definitely be in danger of being eliminated.

2576
01:51:13,151 --> 01:51:15,320
The rule of the World of K-pop Mission...

2577
01:51:15,321 --> 01:51:17,451
is choreography copy challenge.

2578
01:51:18,051 --> 01:51:19,051
Copy?

2579
01:51:19,521 --> 01:51:21,360
We're going to do each other's choreography.

2580
01:51:21,361 --> 01:51:23,730
The two crews in the match...

2581
01:51:23,731 --> 01:51:26,430
will each create a choreography for one part...

2582
01:51:26,431 --> 01:51:29,060
among the two copy challenge parts...

2583
01:51:29,061 --> 01:51:32,031
and copy the choreography of the opponent crew.

2584
01:51:32,931 --> 01:51:35,100
It's important to make a choreography...

2585
01:51:35,101 --> 01:51:36,217
with your crew's strength...

2586
01:51:36,241 --> 01:51:40,840
that the other crew cannot pull off well.

2587
01:51:40,841 --> 01:51:41,881
(Our strength?)

2588
01:51:41,941 --> 01:51:44,751
And we'll strategize on what their weakest point is.

2589
01:51:45,151 --> 01:51:47,751
We have to make something they cannot copy.

2590
01:51:48,551 --> 01:51:50,691
It's a copy challenge.

2591
01:51:51,521 --> 01:51:53,561
You can put about 100 turns.

2592
01:51:54,291 --> 01:51:56,320
I definitely don't want to go against MOTIV.

2593
01:51:56,321 --> 01:51:59,931
They have a great breakdancer called Logan.

2594
01:52:00,931 --> 01:52:02,101
I can't copy that.

2595
01:52:02,631 --> 01:52:04,871
I want to stop going against Rie Hata.

2596
01:52:05,131 --> 01:52:08,040
There's a big gap in the scores.

2597
01:52:08,041 --> 01:52:09,871
So I don't want to go against them.

2598
01:52:10,271 --> 01:52:14,580
So Rie Hata will decide who will get what song?

2599
01:52:14,581 --> 01:52:15,740
She gets to pick.

2600
01:52:15,741 --> 01:52:17,211
She gets to pick. What a shame.

2601
01:52:17,551 --> 01:52:19,550
I wanted everyone to show their best performance.

2602
01:52:19,551 --> 01:52:22,051
I wanted it to be a close battle.

2603
01:52:22,381 --> 01:52:25,150
I want people to think it was a relief...

2604
01:52:25,151 --> 01:52:27,161
that Rie Hata decided on the matchup.

2605
01:52:27,791 --> 01:52:29,621
(After the class mission)

2606
01:52:29,721 --> 01:52:32,331
We did it!

2607
01:52:33,261 --> 01:52:34,631
I'm the best director.

2608
01:52:35,201 --> 01:52:37,071
(I'm cool.)

2609
01:52:37,431 --> 01:52:38,431
That's...

2610
01:52:38,771 --> 01:52:41,171
- That's the queen.
- That's cool.

2611
01:52:41,541 --> 01:52:42,701
It was the best.

2612
01:52:43,611 --> 01:52:45,610
- It was the best.
- The jump.

2613
01:52:45,611 --> 01:52:46,981
Jump.

2614
01:52:48,011 --> 01:52:49,810
We're in first place.

2615
01:52:49,811 --> 01:52:52,750
That's right. Two times in a row since the battle.

2616
01:52:52,751 --> 01:52:53,991
First place two times in a row.

2617
01:52:54,421 --> 01:52:55,421
Great.

2618
01:52:56,221 --> 01:52:59,050
(Selected as the main dancer of the leader class)

2619
01:52:59,051 --> 01:53:02,090
(RHTokyo earned 100 points.)

2620
01:53:02,091 --> 01:53:04,490
(Rie Hata was selected as the best director...)

2621
01:53:04,491 --> 01:53:07,100
(while receiving high praise from the judges.)

2622
01:53:07,101 --> 01:53:08,861
I think the fact that we have 100 points...

2623
01:53:09,061 --> 01:53:10,801
will act as an advantage point.

2624
01:53:10,871 --> 01:53:13,171
The game has started.

2625
01:53:13,541 --> 01:53:17,071
The next mission is the K-pop mission.

2626
01:53:17,471 --> 01:53:19,241
That's my expertise!

2627
01:53:19,441 --> 01:53:21,441
It's time for us to shine.

2628
01:53:22,941 --> 01:53:23,951
How...

2629
01:53:24,251 --> 01:53:25,251
What?

2630
01:53:25,411 --> 01:53:26,581
This is so annoying.

2631
01:53:26,951 --> 01:53:28,680
- Aaliyah and Vanessa.
- What?

2632
01:53:28,681 --> 01:53:30,920
It's not a strategy to choose people...

2633
01:53:30,921 --> 01:53:31,950
who got points.

2634
01:53:31,951 --> 01:53:33,367
Why would she choose people with points?

2635
01:53:33,391 --> 01:53:34,690
That's what I'm saying to Maiya.

2636
01:53:34,691 --> 01:53:37,090
Do it to BUMSUP. Do it to Ojo Gang.

2637
01:53:37,091 --> 01:53:38,491
They can't...

2638
01:53:38,861 --> 01:53:40,200
It wasn't for strategy.

2639
01:53:40,201 --> 01:53:41,931
It was for a personal reason.

2640
01:53:42,131 --> 01:53:45,400
You've literally made us go even like...

2641
01:53:45,401 --> 01:53:46,871
We both have 50 now.

2642
01:53:47,441 --> 01:53:48,441
Because now, it's even.

2643
01:53:48,441 --> 01:53:49,441
Goodness.

2644
01:53:49,841 --> 01:53:50,871
They...

2645
01:53:51,311 --> 01:53:53,681
- We wanted to choose RHTokyo.
- RHTokyo.

2646
01:53:53,911 --> 01:53:56,141
It's hard because we couldn't...

2647
01:53:56,511 --> 01:53:59,150
They put in extra effort to make sure they weren't...

2648
01:53:59,151 --> 01:54:01,151
even like doing good.

2649
01:54:01,651 --> 01:54:03,520
They can't say no to that.

2650
01:54:03,521 --> 01:54:05,290
They came early, and they practiced.

2651
01:54:05,291 --> 01:54:07,190
There's no shame in our reasoning.

2652
01:54:07,191 --> 01:54:10,160
Honestly, I think for us, it's attitude.

2653
01:54:10,161 --> 01:54:11,860
They're doing TikTok.

2654
01:54:11,861 --> 01:54:13,700
We genuinely had our reasons.

2655
01:54:13,701 --> 01:54:16,700
It wasn't an emotional reason for us.

2656
01:54:16,701 --> 01:54:19,270
Ours didn't hurt as much because they just did it back.

2657
01:54:19,271 --> 01:54:20,700
We knew it was coming.

2658
01:54:20,701 --> 01:54:22,071
Seriously.

2659
01:54:22,341 --> 01:54:23,810
I was so worried that...

2660
01:54:23,811 --> 01:54:26,470
now we are both deducted 50 points,

2661
01:54:26,471 --> 01:54:28,710
and Rie Hata is still on 100.

2662
01:54:28,711 --> 01:54:31,751
We kind of shot ourselves in the foot.

2663
01:54:33,111 --> 01:54:34,281
- We're chilling.
- Yes.

2664
01:54:34,751 --> 01:54:36,151
- Zero points.
- Period.

2665
01:54:36,351 --> 01:54:37,420
Not terrible.

2666
01:54:37,421 --> 01:54:38,921
That's better than a negative.

2667
01:54:40,051 --> 01:54:42,360
I do wish maybe...

2668
01:54:42,361 --> 01:54:43,590
I got the Director's cut.

2669
01:54:43,591 --> 01:54:46,460
Give me a little something, like extra five points.

2670
01:54:46,461 --> 01:54:47,800
I don't know, but...

2671
01:54:47,801 --> 01:54:49,561
zero is better than negative.

2672
01:54:49,831 --> 01:54:50,871
Gosh.

2673
01:54:51,331 --> 01:54:52,501
I'm just glad we're safe.

2674
01:54:54,641 --> 01:54:56,241
We're calling Kyoka.

2675
01:54:56,441 --> 01:54:58,611
(They're glad.)

2676
01:54:58,711 --> 01:55:00,071
Kyoka.

2677
01:55:00,411 --> 01:55:02,010
We'll report the result.

2678
01:55:02,011 --> 01:55:03,680
We got...

2679
01:55:03,681 --> 01:55:05,351
the Director's cut!

2680
01:55:06,111 --> 01:55:07,121
Awesome.

2681
01:55:07,981 --> 01:55:09,381
She's happier than us.

2682
01:55:09,981 --> 01:55:12,390
It felt like we finally earned the fruits.

2683
01:55:12,391 --> 01:55:14,790
We finally had the results.

2684
01:55:14,791 --> 01:55:16,461
I was very happy.

2685
01:55:16,961 --> 01:55:18,591
It's a good start.

2686
01:55:18,931 --> 01:55:20,030
It was really nice.

2687
01:55:20,031 --> 01:55:21,630
There were many of your cuts.

2688
01:55:21,631 --> 01:55:22,861
- That's right.
- Right.

2689
01:55:22,961 --> 01:55:24,630
What about the score?

2690
01:55:24,631 --> 01:55:26,530
We have zero points. No plus points.

2691
01:55:26,531 --> 01:55:27,670
That's a relief.

2692
01:55:27,671 --> 01:55:29,470
We don't have minus points.

2693
01:55:29,471 --> 01:55:30,570
It's the same with MOTIV.

2694
01:55:30,571 --> 01:55:31,571
MOTIV has zero points.

2695
01:55:31,572 --> 01:55:33,141
MOTIV also has zero points.

2696
01:55:33,941 --> 01:55:36,141
It was a relief we didn't get minus points.

2697
01:55:36,481 --> 01:55:40,551
And four of us got the Director's cut.

2698
01:55:40,921 --> 01:55:42,720
I was really happy about that.

2699
01:55:42,721 --> 01:55:44,491
We shared the happiness with her.

2700
01:55:45,551 --> 01:55:47,491
Nothing goes our way.

2701
01:55:48,061 --> 01:55:51,290
(BUMSUP's Agit)

2702
01:55:51,291 --> 01:55:52,831
Honey J.

2703
01:55:53,861 --> 01:55:56,560
I hate this show.

2704
01:55:56,561 --> 01:55:58,101
That's right.

2705
01:55:58,201 --> 01:56:00,841
It makes you a fool.

2706
01:56:01,441 --> 01:56:03,271
It crushes your pride.

2707
01:56:03,671 --> 01:56:05,310
The worst dancer...

2708
01:56:05,311 --> 01:56:08,040
- is BUMSUP's Honey J.
- Goodness.

2709
01:56:08,041 --> 01:56:09,480
(BUMSUP will start the next mission with minus 50 points.)

2710
01:56:09,481 --> 01:56:11,981
I had a hard time.

2711
01:56:12,681 --> 01:56:14,851
I know it because I've experienced it before.

2712
01:56:15,521 --> 01:56:18,221
(Even on "Street Woman Fighter,")

2713
01:56:18,321 --> 01:56:20,821
(Honey J was the final worst dancer in the leader class.)

2714
01:56:21,791 --> 01:56:24,031
I felt very sorry for the members.

2715
01:56:24,431 --> 01:56:25,530
I'm really sorry.

2716
01:56:25,531 --> 01:56:28,160
- What are you saying?
- Why are you sorry? Please.

2717
01:56:28,161 --> 01:56:29,300
I know it's hard.

2718
01:56:29,301 --> 01:56:31,130
I feel so unmotivated.

2719
01:56:31,131 --> 01:56:34,001
We know how much you've tried.

2720
01:56:35,371 --> 01:56:37,311
There was nothing but dance in my life.

2721
01:56:37,771 --> 01:56:39,070
My pride was crushed,

2722
01:56:39,071 --> 01:56:40,911
and so was my self-confidence.

2723
01:56:41,711 --> 01:56:42,840
It's okay to lose.

2724
01:56:42,841 --> 01:56:45,110
We'll help you.

2725
01:56:45,111 --> 01:56:47,651
You can rest for a bit. We'll work really hard.

2726
01:56:47,751 --> 01:56:49,480
How many K-pop choreographers do you think are in this crew?

2727
01:56:49,481 --> 01:56:50,590
We can do well.

2728
01:56:50,591 --> 01:56:53,821
Getting rid of minus 50 points is a piece of cake. It's nothing.

2729
01:56:54,021 --> 01:56:55,861
We'll win 5,000 points.

2730
01:56:56,221 --> 01:56:58,630
Don't shed any more tears. Close your tear ducts.

2731
01:56:58,631 --> 01:57:00,831
Don't waste your tears.

2732
01:57:01,101 --> 01:57:04,001
The members comforted me.

2733
01:57:04,201 --> 01:57:06,131
It was a consolation.

2734
01:57:06,431 --> 01:57:08,670
"I'm the leader, so I shouldn't waver."

2735
01:57:08,671 --> 01:57:09,901
I had that resolution.

2736
01:57:10,271 --> 01:57:13,311
I'll come to my senses and work hard.

2737
01:57:14,141 --> 01:57:16,080
Let's kill everyone in this mission.

2738
01:57:16,081 --> 01:57:18,281
- Let's kill everyone.
- Seriously.

2739
01:57:18,651 --> 01:57:20,111
When I came back to the Crew Agit,

2740
01:57:20,381 --> 01:57:22,751
everyone was crying. It was a big mess.

2741
01:57:23,281 --> 01:57:24,651
I'm so annoyed.

2742
01:57:24,751 --> 01:57:27,091
I'll awaken the dark dragon inside me.

2743
01:57:27,691 --> 01:57:29,391
I'll really show them this time.

2744
01:57:30,321 --> 01:57:33,531
World of K-pop Mission.

2745
01:57:33,931 --> 01:57:35,931
(Excited)

2746
01:57:36,061 --> 01:57:37,970
(Revealing the list of matches for the World of K-Pop Mission)

2747
01:57:37,971 --> 01:57:39,970
(Decided by RHTokyo's Rie Hata, the best director)

2748
01:57:39,971 --> 01:57:42,340
Let's see how far they'll toy with us.

2749
01:57:42,341 --> 01:57:43,341
Let's go.

2750
01:57:43,342 --> 01:57:44,411
(Rubbing)

2751
01:57:44,941 --> 01:57:45,941
Let's see.

2752
01:57:46,741 --> 01:57:49,140
Who are we going to get? Which song are we going to get?

2753
01:57:49,141 --> 01:57:51,221
I feel fuzzy. We don't know who will go against who.

2754
01:57:52,281 --> 01:57:56,051
(What are the list of matches Rie Hata decided on?)

2755
01:57:56,881 --> 01:57:59,050
- AG SQUAD or BUMSUP.
- Yes.

2756
01:57:59,051 --> 01:58:02,490
The only tricky thing is getting AG SQUAD.

2757
01:58:02,491 --> 01:58:05,730
They're probably the strongest crew with our style.

2758
01:58:05,731 --> 01:58:06,731
- Yes.
- Yes.

2759
01:58:07,261 --> 01:58:09,200
It doesn't really matter who we get.

2760
01:58:09,201 --> 01:58:10,400
We're going to rip you up.

2761
01:58:10,401 --> 01:58:11,500
(You know about my personality, right?)

2762
01:58:11,501 --> 01:58:14,640
She's going to put us up with ROYAL FAMILY.

2763
01:58:14,641 --> 01:58:17,440
I think the whole competition wants to see that.

2764
01:58:17,441 --> 01:58:19,070
They're going to sit there with their popcorn.

2765
01:58:19,071 --> 01:58:21,911
They'll want to watch ROYAL FAMILY versus AG SQUAD.

2766
01:58:22,741 --> 01:58:24,150
To be honest, whatever...

2767
01:58:24,151 --> 01:58:26,951
Rie chooses, I know that we'll kill it.

2768
01:58:27,651 --> 01:58:29,180
Had I been Rie Hata,

2769
01:58:29,181 --> 01:58:30,420
I would've chosen MOTIV.

2770
01:58:30,421 --> 01:58:31,891
I also think it'll be MOTIV.

2771
01:58:32,451 --> 01:58:33,961
They have a hip-hop style.

2772
01:58:34,421 --> 01:58:36,560
They have the commercial and original style.

2773
01:58:36,561 --> 01:58:39,861
So I expected MOTIV and RHTokyo to compete against each other.

2774
01:58:40,191 --> 01:58:41,730
I think it's going to be us against OSAKA Ojo Gang.

2775
01:58:41,731 --> 01:58:43,261
I think that too.

2776
01:58:43,461 --> 01:58:44,970
Each member has unique charms.

2777
01:58:44,971 --> 01:58:47,341
The two crews are balanced in a similar way.

2778
01:58:47,501 --> 01:58:50,440
If RHTokyo chooses BUMSUP,

2779
01:58:50,441 --> 01:58:52,571
it'll be a face-off.

2780
01:58:53,541 --> 01:58:54,610
Show us the list of matches.

2781
01:58:54,611 --> 01:58:56,910
- Let's go!
- BUMSUP!

2782
01:58:56,911 --> 01:58:58,011
Come on!

2783
01:59:00,281 --> 01:59:01,951
Oh, my gosh!

2784
01:59:02,751 --> 01:59:04,950
(RHTokyo versus BUMSUP)

2785
01:59:04,951 --> 01:59:06,591
(Is this how it's going to be?)

2786
01:59:06,751 --> 01:59:08,390
- Okay.
- She doesn't let go of her target.

2787
01:59:08,391 --> 01:59:10,931
- She doesn't let go of her target.
- Okay.

2788
01:59:11,191 --> 01:59:13,530
I had a lot of thought about it.

2789
01:59:13,531 --> 01:59:17,161
As RHTokyo's opponent,

2790
01:59:17,701 --> 01:59:21,571
I chose BUMSUP since Korea is strong in K-pop.

2791
01:59:22,171 --> 01:59:25,811
They're the strongest when it comes to K-pop.

2792
01:59:26,171 --> 01:59:29,580
They must have a lot of tips and know-how on K-pop...

2793
01:59:29,581 --> 01:59:31,451
as well as experience.

2794
01:59:31,911 --> 01:59:34,881
I'll face them fair and square.

2795
01:59:35,581 --> 01:59:38,820
- She knows how to be on a show.
- She must've watched the show.

2796
01:59:38,821 --> 01:59:41,091
Hey, let's have our revenge this time.

2797
01:59:41,491 --> 01:59:42,520
It's smart of her.

2798
01:59:42,521 --> 01:59:45,161
RHTokyo is in first place, and we're in last place.

2799
01:59:45,261 --> 01:59:48,401
Rie Hata bit us.

2800
01:59:49,601 --> 01:59:50,971
But it was a mistake.

2801
01:59:51,701 --> 01:59:53,601
I can't wait to see Rie's choreography.

2802
01:59:53,801 --> 01:59:55,871
I know. It's bound to be fun. This is the best.

2803
01:59:55,901 --> 01:59:58,970
If we beat BUMSUP,

2804
01:59:58,971 --> 02:00:00,610
we'll be the winner in all three missions.

2805
02:00:00,611 --> 02:00:01,640
Please.

2806
02:00:01,641 --> 02:00:03,111
But is it okay with the show...

2807
02:00:03,541 --> 02:00:06,010
if BUMSUP gets eliminated?

2808
02:00:06,011 --> 02:00:07,420
Even if we don't do anything,

2809
02:00:07,421 --> 02:00:09,181
we'll be able to beat them in a relaxed way.

2810
02:00:09,351 --> 02:00:10,481
Oh, snap.

2811
02:00:11,351 --> 02:00:13,191
She said she wanted that easy win.

2812
02:00:13,591 --> 02:00:15,390
- Oh, my gosh.
- Marlee.

2813
02:00:15,391 --> 02:00:18,290
I want to see RHTokyo and BUMSUP compete...

2814
02:00:18,291 --> 02:00:19,831
for G-DRAGON's song.

2815
02:00:20,861 --> 02:00:22,031
Wouldn't it be amazing?

2816
02:00:22,701 --> 02:00:25,330
I don't think Rie Hata will pick G-DRAGON.

2817
02:00:25,331 --> 02:00:27,870
I don't think she'll do it since she has worked with him.

2818
02:00:27,871 --> 02:00:29,540
All of them...

2819
02:00:29,541 --> 02:00:32,370
must expect me to pick G-DRAGON's song.

2820
02:00:32,371 --> 02:00:34,780
(Rie Hata surprises everyone by picking Jennie's song.)

2821
02:00:34,781 --> 02:00:36,310
I told myself that I wouldn't choose...

2822
02:00:36,311 --> 02:00:38,481
a match I could easily win in.

2823
02:00:38,511 --> 02:00:42,120
I chose Jennie's song because I haven't worked with her.

2824
02:00:42,121 --> 02:00:43,821
I'll challenge myself.

2825
02:00:44,491 --> 02:00:45,850
Jennie!

2826
02:00:45,851 --> 02:00:47,360
(It's lucky that we got Jennie!)

2827
02:00:47,361 --> 02:00:48,760
(BUMSUP is in a festive mood.)

2828
02:00:48,761 --> 02:00:50,591
- Yes!
- All right!

2829
02:00:50,791 --> 02:00:51,791
Okay.

2830
02:00:51,792 --> 02:00:54,730
(She's especially excited.)

2831
02:00:54,731 --> 02:00:55,901
I loved it.

2832
02:00:56,031 --> 02:00:58,570
Jennie is an artist...

2833
02:00:58,571 --> 02:01:02,471
with whom I've worked on for four songs.

2834
02:01:03,271 --> 02:01:06,341
I already have so much data.

2835
02:01:06,641 --> 02:01:08,510
I looked up so many interviews.

2836
02:01:08,511 --> 02:01:10,750
No one understands this song better than me.

2837
02:01:10,751 --> 02:01:12,711
I can do a great job in this match.

2838
02:01:12,981 --> 02:01:14,420
This is our match.

2839
02:01:14,421 --> 02:01:16,250
- It's the hottest.
- Yes. It's the hottest.

2840
02:01:16,251 --> 02:01:18,720
You can't underestimate Team Korea though. They're Koreans.

2841
02:01:18,721 --> 02:01:19,750
This is theirs.

2842
02:01:19,751 --> 02:01:22,190
Korean pop. That's K-pop.

2843
02:01:22,191 --> 02:01:24,360
Oh, my gosh. Gabee, we're going to kill this.

2844
02:01:24,361 --> 02:01:25,361
I know.

2845
02:01:25,362 --> 02:01:28,601
I'm so freaking excited.

2846
02:01:28,761 --> 02:01:31,801
Honey J, I'll avenge you. Don't worry about a thing.

2847
02:01:35,201 --> 02:01:37,371
I'm still torn about this one.

2848
02:01:38,441 --> 02:01:39,811
ROYAL FAMILY and...

2849
02:01:40,981 --> 02:01:46,551
(ROYAL FAMILY expected AG SQUAD to be their rival.)

2850
02:01:46,751 --> 02:01:49,751
(What will be Rie Hata's choice?)

2851
02:01:50,921 --> 02:01:52,221
AG SQUAD.

2852
02:01:52,891 --> 02:01:55,391
I want to see a close match between them for this mission.

2853
02:01:55,461 --> 02:02:00,630
(They have similar energy and vibe.)

2854
02:02:00,631 --> 02:02:03,500
(They picked each other as the worst dancer...)

2855
02:02:03,501 --> 02:02:05,330
(and ended up getting the same score.)

2856
02:02:05,331 --> 02:02:07,941
(With Rie Hata's decision, they'll have a rematch.)

2857
02:02:08,001 --> 02:02:09,971
- Oh, yes. Okay.
- I knew it.

2858
02:02:10,771 --> 02:02:12,071
Okay. No, it's all good.

2859
02:02:12,271 --> 02:02:13,810
They're going to want to prove...

2860
02:02:13,811 --> 02:02:15,531
- our points.
- They're going to be hungry.

2861
02:02:16,181 --> 02:02:17,181
For goodness' sake.

2862
02:02:17,182 --> 02:02:18,651
- We knew this would happen.
- Yes.

2863
02:02:18,681 --> 02:02:20,280
- Okay. Which song?
- Which song?

2864
02:02:20,281 --> 02:02:21,580
AG SQUAD.

2865
02:02:21,581 --> 02:02:23,350
I chose aespa.

2866
02:02:23,351 --> 02:02:27,621
If ROYAL FAMILY or AG SQUAD work on this song,

2867
02:02:27,721 --> 02:02:29,821
they'll be able to liven up the atmosphere.

2868
02:02:30,861 --> 02:02:33,360
We'll be able to do whatever they come up with.

2869
02:02:33,361 --> 02:02:36,060
We can definitely make them cool, still.

2870
02:02:36,061 --> 02:02:37,771
Can they do what we do?

2871
02:02:38,371 --> 02:02:41,401
We'll make sure that the new generation is strong...

2872
02:02:41,501 --> 02:02:42,701
like the old generation.

2873
02:02:43,401 --> 02:02:45,410
Dramamama. Yes. "Drama" is nice.

2874
02:02:45,411 --> 02:02:47,110
Yes. I like "Drama."

2875
02:02:47,111 --> 02:02:48,440
I think they'll expect...

2876
02:02:48,441 --> 02:02:49,841
- the same vibe.
- Yes.

2877
02:02:49,941 --> 02:02:51,050
I don't think we're the same.

2878
02:02:51,051 --> 02:02:53,010
And I think we have a lot to show.

2879
02:02:53,011 --> 02:02:54,280
I like that we got them...

2880
02:02:54,281 --> 02:02:55,821
because we can do what they can do.

2881
02:02:55,921 --> 02:02:58,420
I'm very confident that AG SQUAD can win.

2882
02:02:58,421 --> 02:02:59,421
Are you ready?

2883
02:03:02,091 --> 02:03:05,331
(Which crew did Rie Hata choose as OSAKA Ojo Gang's rival?)

2884
02:03:06,661 --> 02:03:07,930
When the crew was revealed, I went,

2885
02:03:07,931 --> 02:03:09,760
"We're set!"

2886
02:03:09,761 --> 02:03:11,501
It's good. Nice.

2887
02:03:11,601 --> 02:03:13,030
(She's highly satisfied with the rival crew.)

2888
02:03:13,031 --> 02:03:14,100
(Meanwhile, MOTIV's reactions are the opposite.)

2889
02:03:14,101 --> 02:03:15,300
- OSAKA Ojo Gang?
- You know what?

2890
02:03:15,301 --> 02:03:16,670
It's us versus OSAKA Ojo Gang.

2891
02:03:16,671 --> 02:03:18,340
- I'm not mad about that.
- Yes.

2892
02:03:18,341 --> 02:03:19,640
They'll waack.

2893
02:03:19,641 --> 02:03:21,240
But we knew that we were going to have them.

2894
02:03:21,241 --> 02:03:23,240
Hold on. We don't know which song we'll get.

2895
02:03:23,241 --> 02:03:25,880
Ruu, Uwa, or Ibuki...

2896
02:03:25,881 --> 02:03:28,080
will want a song by a female artist.

2897
02:03:28,081 --> 02:03:30,121
It'll be great to get a female artist.

2898
02:03:31,591 --> 02:03:33,721
(OSAKA Ojo Gang left the fight zone first.)

2899
02:03:34,391 --> 02:03:36,020
Which song do you want?

2900
02:03:36,021 --> 02:03:38,190
Jennie or aespa.

2901
02:03:38,191 --> 02:03:39,191
Is that what you want?

2902
02:03:39,491 --> 02:03:40,691
(I see!)

2903
02:03:41,131 --> 02:03:44,271
So they should challenge themselves with G-DRAGON's song.

2904
02:03:44,371 --> 02:03:46,130
(The two crews will compete with G-DRAGON's song.)

2905
02:03:46,131 --> 02:03:49,201
(No way)

2906
02:03:49,241 --> 02:03:51,371
- How scary!
- She's bullying us.

2907
02:03:51,411 --> 02:03:52,470
She's bullying us.

2908
02:03:52,471 --> 02:03:53,640
(We like hip-hop.)

2909
02:03:53,641 --> 02:03:55,910
G-DRAGON!

2910
02:03:55,911 --> 02:03:58,181
- We're going to slay.
- Yes, we're going to do well.

2911
02:03:58,251 --> 02:04:00,251
We're going to the good boys, guys.

2912
02:04:00,281 --> 02:04:03,520
And I think that she's a MOTIV supporter.

2913
02:04:03,521 --> 02:04:06,191
I think that was her doing us a favor.

2914
02:04:06,321 --> 02:04:09,320
I had a feeling that she wanted to give MOTIV a chance.

2915
02:04:09,321 --> 02:04:10,420
Okay then.

2916
02:04:10,421 --> 02:04:12,660
If that's their mindset, we'll be the same.

2917
02:04:12,661 --> 02:04:14,501
(Just you watch!)

2918
02:04:18,171 --> 02:04:20,230
(MOTIV will face OSAKA Ojo Gang for the G-DRAGON match.)

2919
02:04:20,231 --> 02:04:22,100
(MOTIV is having a meeting to decide on a part.)

2920
02:04:22,101 --> 02:04:25,811
Obviously, we're going to use Logistx.

2921
02:04:26,171 --> 02:04:28,310
I'm trying to think of something they can't do.

2922
02:04:28,311 --> 02:04:30,380
The "La la la" part is a buildup.

2923
02:04:30,381 --> 02:04:32,181
There's a lot more we can do with this.

2924
02:04:32,281 --> 02:04:33,980
Let's take a strategic approach.

2925
02:04:33,981 --> 02:04:36,721
Waacking is the only thing they can't do.

2926
02:04:36,821 --> 02:04:38,920
If we add a waacking move they can't do, we'll win.

2927
02:04:38,921 --> 02:04:40,250
Ibuki, you'll be able to show them.

2928
02:04:40,251 --> 02:04:42,490
(GD match, Part A of "GOOD BOY")

2929
02:04:42,491 --> 02:04:43,661
It has to be Part A.

2930
02:04:43,821 --> 02:04:45,190
I think they'll want Part A.

2931
02:04:45,191 --> 02:04:46,731
They won't back down...

2932
02:04:46,831 --> 02:04:48,361
even if their hair gets pulled out.

2933
02:04:49,301 --> 02:04:50,500
(Knocking)

2934
02:04:50,501 --> 02:04:51,531
(Startled)

2935
02:04:52,501 --> 02:04:53,601
- MOTIV?
- Yes?

2936
02:04:54,541 --> 02:04:57,401
(MOTV visits OSAKA Ojo Gang's Crew Agit.)

2937
02:04:58,271 --> 02:04:59,440
- Hi, girls.
- Hi.

2938
02:04:59,441 --> 02:05:02,241
(MOTIV versus OSAKA Ojo Gang, Who will get which part?)

2939
02:05:02,341 --> 02:05:05,010
Let's not talk about the part we want.

2940
02:05:05,011 --> 02:05:06,581
(Nodding)

2941
02:05:06,881 --> 02:05:08,520
So, did you hear the music?

2942
02:05:08,521 --> 02:05:09,521
Yes.

2943
02:05:09,781 --> 02:05:11,421
Which part would you like?

2944
02:05:11,991 --> 02:05:13,690
Which part would you like?

2945
02:05:13,691 --> 02:05:14,691
How about you?

2946
02:05:14,692 --> 02:05:15,890
(Tense)

2947
02:05:15,891 --> 02:05:18,760
There might be a difference in opinions.

2948
02:05:18,761 --> 02:05:20,591
I could feel a little bit of tension.

2949
02:05:20,961 --> 02:05:23,701
(A war of nerves)

2950
02:05:23,861 --> 02:05:25,430
The parts are very different, right?

2951
02:05:25,431 --> 02:05:26,471
Yes.

2952
02:05:26,731 --> 02:05:28,101
Do you have a preference?

2953
02:05:28,501 --> 02:05:29,970
How about you?

2954
02:05:29,971 --> 02:05:31,370
(She gets a headache.)

2955
02:05:31,371 --> 02:05:33,440
Okay. We can't tell them what we want.

2956
02:05:33,441 --> 02:05:35,111
We need them to reveal.

2957
02:05:35,281 --> 02:05:37,180
"So, which one do you want?"

2958
02:05:37,181 --> 02:05:38,210
"How about you?"

2959
02:05:38,211 --> 02:05:39,710
"Which part do you want?"

2960
02:05:39,711 --> 02:05:40,711
"How about you?"

2961
02:05:40,712 --> 02:05:42,272
We kept going back and forth like that.

2962
02:05:42,381 --> 02:05:44,421
Neither one of us wanted to say it first.

2963
02:05:44,991 --> 02:05:47,051
Don't you have anything you want to do?

2964
02:05:47,221 --> 02:05:48,261
Maybe.

2965
02:05:48,691 --> 02:05:52,431
There was a bit of silence when none of us spoke.

2966
02:05:52,661 --> 02:05:53,861
"What will happen?"

2967
02:05:55,161 --> 02:05:56,661
- Shall we just tell them?
- Yes.

2968
02:05:57,131 --> 02:06:00,401
Okay. So, we'll go with A.

2969
02:06:00,531 --> 02:06:01,701
- With A?
- Yes.

2970
02:06:02,271 --> 02:06:03,741
(Grinning)

2971
02:06:04,341 --> 02:06:05,670
We want B.

2972
02:06:05,671 --> 02:06:06,811
(Happy)

2973
02:06:06,941 --> 02:06:08,501
- I'm thinking the "POWER" part.
- Yes.

2974
02:06:08,941 --> 02:06:10,111
For us to do?

2975
02:06:10,511 --> 02:06:11,910
(The negotiation for the GD match ends peacefully.)

2976
02:06:11,911 --> 02:06:15,250
Don't listen to this conversation.

2977
02:06:15,251 --> 02:06:16,851
We got A!

2978
02:06:16,921 --> 02:06:18,090
We won!

2979
02:06:18,091 --> 02:06:20,291
(They're in the best mood.)

2980
02:06:20,721 --> 02:06:23,660
We already won.

2981
02:06:23,661 --> 02:06:24,860
(We already won.)

2982
02:06:24,861 --> 02:06:27,160
MOTIV will be in danger if we take this part.

2983
02:06:27,161 --> 02:06:31,401
They're giving us Part A, which is easier for waacking.

2984
02:06:32,001 --> 02:06:33,131
Thank you.

2985
02:06:34,971 --> 02:06:37,041
You can't change the piece.

2986
02:06:37,201 --> 02:06:39,140
So how are they going to...

2987
02:06:39,141 --> 02:06:42,140
It's just funny to think about them trying to pick up my breaking moves.

2988
02:06:42,141 --> 02:06:44,081
That's going to be really bad for them.

2989
02:06:44,681 --> 02:06:46,010
They're going to do this thing.

2990
02:06:46,011 --> 02:06:47,011
- Whiplash.
- Right.

2991
02:06:47,151 --> 02:06:49,281
We should do Whiplash.

2992
02:06:49,551 --> 02:06:51,221
Yes, we will.

2993
02:06:51,591 --> 02:06:54,620
Whiplash is upbeat.

2994
02:06:54,621 --> 02:06:57,991
So, we felt like we could make something exciting for section B.

2995
02:06:58,961 --> 02:07:01,501
- Hi, girls.
- Hey.

2996
02:07:01,631 --> 02:07:03,830
AG SQUAD came into the room.

2997
02:07:03,831 --> 02:07:06,771
I was thinking, "Oh, no. What if we want the same?"

2998
02:07:07,501 --> 02:07:08,701
Which one do you want?

2999
02:07:09,641 --> 02:07:11,571
We're happy to hear what you want to do.

3000
02:07:11,671 --> 02:07:14,941
We thought we'd probably suit Whiplash better.

3001
02:07:15,611 --> 02:07:16,611
(Watching their reaction)

3002
02:07:17,811 --> 02:07:19,711
Okay. We can go with that.

3003
02:07:19,811 --> 02:07:21,981
I was a bit surprised.

3004
02:07:22,081 --> 02:07:23,721
We're a bit taken aback.

3005
02:07:23,921 --> 02:07:26,921
We'll do A, you do B, Whiplash.

3006
02:07:27,221 --> 02:07:30,321
- Is it okay? Are you okay with it?
- Yes.

3007
02:07:31,291 --> 02:07:33,391
So, which part do you want?

3008
02:07:33,931 --> 02:07:35,231
Which part do you prefer?

3009
02:07:35,801 --> 02:07:38,370
We do, "This that pretty girl mantra."

3010
02:07:38,371 --> 02:07:41,241
"This that flaunt you" and "down in L.A." This part.

3011
02:07:41,541 --> 02:07:45,310
I thought about highlighting...

3012
02:07:45,311 --> 02:07:48,011
the orientalism of Mantra.

3013
02:07:48,111 --> 02:07:49,210
This part is for copying.

3014
02:07:49,211 --> 02:07:50,880
(JENNIE match: Section B "Like Jennie")

3015
02:07:50,881 --> 02:07:54,481
It has a tempo that we can work with well.

3016
02:07:54,581 --> 02:07:56,220
Jennie, Jennie.

3017
02:07:56,221 --> 02:07:58,421
We're really good with this mood.

3018
02:07:58,591 --> 02:08:00,290
- Let's say it at the same time.
- Okay.

3019
02:08:00,291 --> 02:08:02,361
On the count of three. Okay?

3020
02:08:02,391 --> 02:08:04,261
- Three, two, one.
- Three, two, one.

3021
02:08:04,561 --> 02:08:07,361
(What...)

3022
02:08:07,691 --> 02:08:10,631
(will be their choices?)

3023
02:08:10,761 --> 02:08:12,501
- A.
- B.

3024
02:08:12,801 --> 02:08:13,801
(This is good.)

3025
02:08:13,802 --> 02:08:16,971
There are two people who are well-known in K-pop.

3026
02:08:17,341 --> 02:08:21,081
I've never been this confident while doing the WSWF.

3027
02:08:21,311 --> 02:08:23,417
Honey J, I'll get revenge for you. Just wait and see.

3028
02:08:23,441 --> 02:08:25,551
(Negotiating the choreography copy is complete.)

3029
02:08:26,311 --> 02:08:29,121
Lip J, I'm so mad.

3030
02:08:29,221 --> 02:08:31,250
Let me know something I can say in English...

3031
02:08:31,251 --> 02:08:33,691
- To them?
- to dominate them.

3032
02:08:33,791 --> 02:08:35,721
Things you can say to dominate them.

3033
02:08:36,421 --> 02:08:38,931
You can find a lot of expressions here.

3034
02:08:39,031 --> 02:08:41,231
- What is that?
- It's an app.

3035
02:08:41,561 --> 02:08:44,731
- Okay.
- Here is a free talk menu.

3036
02:08:45,871 --> 02:08:47,871
- We can create a scenario.
- Okay.

3037
02:08:48,501 --> 02:08:51,771
- Look. My role is... A dancer.
- A dancer.

3038
02:08:52,141 --> 02:08:54,210
And the other person...

3039
02:08:54,211 --> 02:08:55,611
is a very rude dancer.

3040
02:08:56,881 --> 02:08:58,351
- Rude.
- A rude dancer.

3041
02:08:58,881 --> 02:09:00,050
- Rude.
- Rude.

3042
02:09:00,051 --> 02:09:01,981
Oh, my gosh. So rude!

3043
02:09:02,081 --> 02:09:03,721
(Laughing)

3044
02:09:04,351 --> 02:09:06,651
And I'll set a situation.

3045
02:09:06,851 --> 02:09:08,360
Let's begin the conversation.

3046
02:09:08,361 --> 02:09:10,420
Listen to what it tells us.

3047
02:09:10,421 --> 02:09:11,761
Okay. Bring it on.

3048
02:09:12,361 --> 02:09:14,501
You think you can beat me?

3049
02:09:14,601 --> 02:09:15,860
You must be joking.

3050
02:09:15,861 --> 02:09:17,301
Get ready to lose.

3051
02:09:17,401 --> 02:09:20,271
What? How old are you to say like that?

3052
02:09:20,531 --> 02:09:22,270
(What will the rude dancer say?)

3053
02:09:22,271 --> 02:09:24,540
How old are you to talk like that?

3054
02:09:24,541 --> 02:09:26,070
Age doesn't matter in dance battles.

3055
02:09:26,071 --> 02:09:27,741
That makes sense.

3056
02:09:28,281 --> 02:09:30,210
It understands us well.

3057
02:09:30,211 --> 02:09:31,211
You're dead.

3058
02:09:31,611 --> 02:09:33,051
There are stars.

3059
02:09:33,151 --> 02:09:36,220
- Click the star. You're going down.
- Okay.

3060
02:09:36,221 --> 02:09:38,090
"You're dead" might sound scary when translated literally.

3061
02:09:38,091 --> 02:09:39,850
"You're going down" is used when you win...

3062
02:09:39,851 --> 02:09:42,290
in sports or games, so it sounds more natural.

3063
02:09:42,291 --> 02:09:45,491
- Not to be so rude.
- You're going down.

3064
02:09:45,591 --> 02:09:48,131
- Yes. Right.
- It teaches me better expressions.

3065
02:09:48,231 --> 02:09:50,600
You should stop saying, "You're dead."

3066
02:09:50,601 --> 02:09:51,730
You're going down.

3067
02:09:51,731 --> 02:09:53,271
You're going down. We're going up.

3068
02:09:54,331 --> 02:09:56,701
- We're going up.
- We're going up.

3069
02:09:56,941 --> 02:09:58,111
We're going up.

3070
02:09:58,211 --> 02:10:00,371
Finally, it's the mission we're good at.

3071
02:10:00,471 --> 02:10:02,611
- That's right.
- Let's stop losing.

3072
02:10:02,841 --> 02:10:04,751
Let's show what we're good at now.

3073
02:10:04,851 --> 02:10:06,411
- Yes!
- Okay!

3074
02:10:06,511 --> 02:10:09,220
- Let's go!
- You're going down.

3075
02:10:09,221 --> 02:10:13,051
You're going down.

3076
02:10:14,251 --> 02:10:15,290
(OSAKA Ojo Gang is taking a break.)

3077
02:10:15,291 --> 02:10:19,791
I practiced until the end even yesterday.

3078
02:10:19,891 --> 02:10:20,991
Look at that.

3079
02:10:22,131 --> 02:10:23,860
It looks tasty.

3080
02:10:23,861 --> 02:10:26,431
I'm starving, so I'd eat anything.

3081
02:10:26,831 --> 02:10:27,831
I want something sweet.

3082
02:10:29,041 --> 02:10:31,201
Let's bring it to Crew Agit to share it with everyone.

3083
02:10:32,041 --> 02:10:34,580
Let's eat it at Crew Agit.

3084
02:10:34,581 --> 02:10:38,051
- Let's eat.
- Thanks for the snack.

3085
02:10:38,781 --> 02:10:39,951
(Sniffing)

3086
02:10:40,711 --> 02:10:42,721
(Good)

3087
02:10:43,321 --> 02:10:44,821
I can smell apples.

3088
02:10:45,691 --> 02:10:48,191
I like the balance of taste between apples and coconuts.

3089
02:10:48,961 --> 02:10:50,391
I like that it's a healthy snack.

3090
02:10:52,191 --> 02:10:53,531
It's crunchy.

3091
02:10:53,961 --> 02:10:55,130
(Laughing)

3092
02:10:55,131 --> 02:10:56,201
I can't stop eating.

3093
02:10:56,361 --> 02:10:57,701
- Isn't it good?
- It's good.

3094
02:10:58,671 --> 02:11:00,191
It's so tasty, so I can't stop eating.

3095
02:11:00,601 --> 02:11:01,681
- Did you finish it?
- Yes.

3096
02:11:03,871 --> 02:11:05,840
This is so tasty.

3097
02:11:05,841 --> 02:11:08,181
(Recharged with tasty snacks)

3098
02:11:08,641 --> 02:11:10,681
Let's go back to practice.

3099
02:11:11,081 --> 02:11:14,281
- Who wants to practice?
- Me!

3100
02:11:15,121 --> 02:11:17,021
Okay. Let's do it slowly.

3101
02:11:17,251 --> 02:11:18,990
Five, six, seven, eight.

3102
02:11:18,991 --> 02:11:20,690
We really want to showcase Danica...

3103
02:11:20,691 --> 02:11:22,720
because she's so talented with...

3104
02:11:22,721 --> 02:11:24,731
her backbend and tricks on the floor,

3105
02:11:24,831 --> 02:11:27,561
as well as Aaliyah and Vanessa. They're very good at...

3106
02:11:27,761 --> 02:11:28,801
stuff on the floor.

3107
02:11:29,501 --> 02:11:32,470
I do feel like they would think it's challenging.

3108
02:11:32,471 --> 02:11:34,570
(aespa match: Section B “Whiplash”)

3109
02:11:34,571 --> 02:11:37,571
We love doing fast-tempo movements.

3110
02:11:37,771 --> 02:11:42,111
I feel like that would be a challenging part for AG SQUAD.

3111
02:11:42,481 --> 02:11:47,410
(GD match: Section A "Good Boy")

3112
02:11:47,411 --> 02:11:50,150
I don't think any dancers can do what I do.

3113
02:11:50,151 --> 02:11:52,921
No one can do Ibuki's waacking.

3114
02:11:53,351 --> 02:11:55,890
When OSAKA Ojo Gang watches our copy section,

3115
02:11:55,891 --> 02:11:58,091
they're going to feel stressed.

3116
02:11:58,191 --> 02:12:00,090
If you have to copy it exactly,

3117
02:12:00,091 --> 02:12:01,561
you have to be a B-girl.

3118
02:12:02,231 --> 02:12:04,871
We have worked with numerous artists,

3119
02:12:04,971 --> 02:12:07,431
so I'm confident we have a good understanding of K-pop.

3120
02:12:07,731 --> 02:12:09,171
It won't be easy to copy.

3121
02:12:09,441 --> 02:12:13,370
I created it, incorporating all Rie Hata's iconic movements,

3122
02:12:13,371 --> 02:12:16,341
so it feels like it's a package.

3123
02:12:16,641 --> 02:12:18,310
It'll be a real challenge to copy.

3124
02:12:18,311 --> 02:12:20,211
I don't think anyone can.

3125
02:12:20,951 --> 02:12:23,651
(The first elimination mission, World of K-pop)

3126
02:12:23,751 --> 02:12:25,711
(Fiery dance battles for survival or elimination)

3127
02:12:25,851 --> 02:12:27,291
(GD match, OSAKA Ojo Gang vs MOTIV)

3128
02:12:27,551 --> 02:12:28,921
We're going to win.

3129
02:12:29,221 --> 02:12:31,461
I don't think they're the strongest crew.

3130
02:12:31,691 --> 02:12:36,201
We choreographed something you'd never be able to copy.

3131
02:12:36,301 --> 02:12:38,270
You think you can pull up?

3132
02:12:38,271 --> 02:12:41,341
I'm ready to see you all try to learn our choreography.

3133
02:12:41,801 --> 02:12:43,171
It won't be a problem.

3134
02:12:43,301 --> 02:12:46,270
We can stand out even more in a K-pop mission.

3135
02:12:46,271 --> 02:12:48,841
Ojo? More like oh, no.

3136
02:12:52,611 --> 02:12:54,027
(aespa match, AG SQUAD vs ROYAL FAMILY)

3137
02:12:54,051 --> 02:12:57,950
We have a stronger performance average standard than AG SQUAD does.

3138
02:12:57,951 --> 02:12:59,820
AG SQUAD has a sense of...

3139
02:12:59,821 --> 02:13:02,661
an older, mature approach to the dance.

3140
02:13:02,991 --> 02:13:05,531
Let's put on a show. Bring it.

3141
02:13:06,091 --> 02:13:07,631
Let me show you who's the queen.

3142
02:13:08,261 --> 02:13:10,460
Being an original member of ROYAL FAMILY,

3143
02:13:10,461 --> 02:13:11,600
I'm not overwhelmed.

3144
02:13:11,601 --> 02:13:14,371
Cheers. Let's give the people what they want. Put on a show.

3145
02:13:17,971 --> 02:13:20,771
BUMSUP and RHTokyo.

(JENNIE match, BUMSUP vs RHTokyo)

3147
02:13:23,081 --> 02:13:25,551
In this K-pop mission,

3148
02:13:25,651 --> 02:13:28,921
I know how to win easily.

3149
02:13:29,021 --> 02:13:31,890
You know we're one of the strongest crews...

3150
02:13:31,891 --> 02:13:33,351
in this K-pop mission.

3151
02:13:33,691 --> 02:13:35,761
Sisters, we're sorry.

3152
02:13:35,861 --> 02:13:41,501
The thing is that RHTokyo is just way better than you.

3153
02:13:41,631 --> 02:13:42,801
What? What did she say?

3154
02:13:43,061 --> 02:13:46,571
You are going down.
