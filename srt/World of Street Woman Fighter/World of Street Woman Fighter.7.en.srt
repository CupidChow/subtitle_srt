00:00:27,097 --> 00:00:28,926
(A month ago)

2
00:00:28,927 --> 00:00:31,226
- Hello. - Hello.

3
00:00:31,227 --> 00:00:33,896
We're AG SQUAD.

4
00:00:33,897 --> 00:00:36,466
- Please vote for us. - AG SQUAD.

5
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:38,806
(A video they filmed in Korean was uploaded on social media.)

6
00:00:38,807 --> 00:00:40,406
("How is Kyra so good at Korean? Be honest, Kyra. Are you Korean?")

7
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,236
("You've got a talent for Korean. Your Korean is impressive.")

8
00:00:42,237 --> 00:00:45,106
I'm the Korean speaker for AG SQUAD.

9
00:00:45,107 --> 00:00:46,976
(Laughing)

10
00:00:46,977 --> 00:00:50,716
Learn the language and be able to connect with our fans...

11
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,046
by speaking their language.

12
00:00:52,047 --> 00:00:53,517
That's why we did this video.

13
00:00:54,057 --> 00:00:55,856
Hello, everyone.

14
00:00:55,857 --> 00:00:59,086
We're Ibuki, Kyoka, and Hana.

15
00:00:59,087 --> 00:01:00,626
- Really? - Really?

16
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,026
(The crew communicates with fans in adorable Korean.)

17
00:01:02,027 --> 00:01:04,327
Goodnight, sweeties.

18
00:01:05,427 --> 00:01:08,367
Our fans are very supportive of us.

19
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:12,167
I'm very grateful for the growing fanbase.

20
00:01:12,267 --> 00:01:14,306
To try and interact with my fans,

21
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:17,006
I tried my best to learn the Korean language.

22
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:20,846
One thing that I've gotten used to here in Korea is...

23
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:24,246
Culture's definitely something that I've become obsessed with.

24
00:01:24,247 --> 00:01:26,716
Learn more of the language easily...

25
00:01:26,717 --> 00:01:29,187
and the culture as well here in Korea.

26
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:30,886
It's good.

27
00:01:30,887 --> 00:01:32,156
- It's good. - It's good.

28
00:01:32,157 --> 00:01:34,826
Thank you.

29
00:01:34,827 --> 00:01:36,327
- I'm hungry. - I'm hungry.

30
00:01:36,427 --> 00:01:38,496
Go Ruthy! In 1, 2, 3!

31
00:01:38,497 --> 00:01:39,997
Yes. In 1, 2, 3!

32
00:01:40,637 --> 00:01:41,996
Yes. In 1, 2, 3!

33
00:01:41,997 --> 00:01:43,036
(Saying the phrases they hear often out loud without hesitation...)

34
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:45,336
(is helping the crews improve their Korean.)

35
00:01:45,337 --> 00:01:46,906
(Singing)

36
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:49,176
- How do you say "Wait?" - Wait.

37
00:01:49,177 --> 00:01:50,236
- "Wait." - "Wait."

38
00:01:50,237 --> 00:01:54,716
- Wait. - Wait.

39
00:01:54,717 --> 00:01:55,717
Just a moment!

40
00:01:55,718 --> 00:01:58,316
How do you say "Shake it, shake it, shake it, baby. Shake it fast..."

41
00:01:58,317 --> 00:01:59,317
- in Korean? - In Korean?

42
00:01:59,318 --> 00:02:00,757
It's "Shake it."

43
00:02:01,057 --> 00:02:02,157
(Okay, that's easy.)

44
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:05,027
(Shake it)

45
00:02:05,227 --> 00:02:06,786
(Shake it fast)

46
00:02:06,787 --> 00:02:07,856
(I'm still struggling with it.)

47
00:02:07,857 --> 00:02:08,857
Hey, I'm...

48
00:02:08,858 --> 00:02:11,727
I'm learning Korean through an app.

49
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:16,596
Give it to me. Sorry. My bad. Give it to me.

50
00:02:16,597 --> 00:02:18,717
(Kaidi sings the soulful version of "Give It to Me.")

51
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:20,676
(They formed an a cappella group.)

52
00:02:20,677 --> 00:02:21,706
(She's blending the Korean she learned with the melody and rhythm.)

53
00:02:21,707 --> 00:02:22,787
(There's choreography too.)

54
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:25,347
(Give it to me)

55
00:02:25,747 --> 00:02:28,416
(MOTIV is passionate about the Korean language.)

56
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:30,747
Please vote for us.

57
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:33,416
We're AG SQUAD.

58
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:36,287
Please vote for us!

59
00:02:36,517 --> 00:02:37,627
Can we say it, everyone?

60
00:02:37,727 --> 00:02:39,957
Please vote for us.

61
00:02:41,197 --> 00:02:44,726
(Even onstage, they shouted their iconic voting chant.)

62
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:46,567
(Laughing)

63
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,637
- Please vote for us. - Yes.

64
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:53,067
(The audience sang along in unison to their voting chant.)

65
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:56,476
When you care about things, it comes back to you.

66
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:58,577
That's a big thing for AG SQUAD.

67
00:02:58,807 --> 00:03:00,746
We really love being here.

68
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,676
We really love the fanbase.

69
00:03:02,677 --> 00:03:05,186
And we really love the culture of Korea.

70
00:03:05,187 --> 00:03:08,387
Korean people are so supportive.

71
00:03:08,487 --> 00:03:10,886
We've built such a great connection with the fans.

72
00:03:10,887 --> 00:03:12,226
Thank you.

73
00:03:12,227 --> 00:03:14,957
We felt very loved by all the fans.

74
00:03:15,097 --> 00:03:16,327
Yes, it was cool.

75
00:03:16,527 --> 00:03:19,266
Please continue supporting us.

76
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:22,796
- Thank you. - Thank you.

77
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:24,937
- We love you. - Hey.

78
00:03:25,607 --> 00:03:27,337
Gosh, this place is so cool.

79
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:29,277
What's going on?

80
00:03:29,537 --> 00:03:30,907
Why are we here?

81
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:32,606
We were asked to give you this.

82
00:03:32,607 --> 00:03:33,677
Gosh, what's this?

83
00:03:34,517 --> 00:03:35,957
- What is that? - Is this a mission?

84
00:03:36,077 --> 00:03:38,386
- Gosh. - Do we have to do a mission here?

85
00:03:38,387 --> 00:03:40,317
None of us knows what's going on.

86
00:03:40,617 --> 00:03:42,556
- I will reveal what the mission is. - Okay.

87
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:43,557
I'm curious.

88
00:03:44,187 --> 00:03:45,286
- What? - What is it?

89
00:03:45,287 --> 00:03:47,926
Why are the corners of your mouth twitching?

90
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,897
"The reward for winning the Mega Crew Mission."

91
00:03:51,797 --> 00:03:53,997
- The reward. - "Skin care voucher."

92
00:03:54,737 --> 00:03:56,096
That sounds amazing.

93
00:03:56,097 --> 00:03:57,966
That's awesome.

94
00:03:57,967 --> 00:04:00,607
- Let's go get the consultation. - I want to get the consultation.

95
00:04:01,377 --> 00:04:03,436
- Hello. - Hello.

96
00:04:03,437 --> 00:04:05,246
Tell me about your skin concerns.

97
00:04:05,247 --> 00:04:08,947
We pulled all-nighters to prepare for the mission.

98
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:12,587
We sweat a lot. Does sweating cause acne?

99
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:14,757
What about wearing makeup for a long time?

100
00:04:15,717 --> 00:04:17,386
Obviously, it's bad for you.

101
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:20,126
Each one is bad on its own, but if all three occur together...

102
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,127
If all three...

103
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,356
That's the worst-case scenario.

104
00:04:22,357 --> 00:04:24,867
- It's the complete package. - Your skin cannot recover.

105
00:04:25,227 --> 00:04:26,927
- Then today... - I want to get started.

106
00:04:28,237 --> 00:04:31,067
- I will now begin the treatment. - Okay.

107
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:33,507
We pulled all-nighters and worked really hard,

108
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,776
so this feels like real luxury.

109
00:04:34,777 --> 00:04:36,476
We've prepared special gifts for you.

110
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,547
- Thank you. - Thank you.

111
00:04:38,877 --> 00:04:40,277
- I'm touched. - Thank you so much.

112
00:04:40,307 --> 00:04:42,017
- Thank you. - We'll use them well.

113
00:04:42,317 --> 00:04:45,246
World of Street Woman Fighter is powered by...

114
00:04:45,247 --> 00:04:49,017
product sponsorship and partnership with a leading K-culture brand.

115
00:04:50,017 --> 00:04:51,456
(Last week)

116
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,356
(The results of the second elimination battle at WSWF)

117
00:04:53,357 --> 00:04:54,926
(AG SQUAD made it to the semi-final round.)

118
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,767
(RHTokyo left World of Street Woman Fighter.)

119
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,526
(AG SQUAD, BUMSUP, MOTIV, and OSAKA Ojo Gang...)

120
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:00,927
(advanced to the semi-final round.)

121
00:05:00,997 --> 00:05:02,436
(After intense competition, )

122
00:05:02,437 --> 00:05:04,036
(the final gateway to the finals.)

123
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,936
(The top 4 is where it gets real.)

124
00:05:05,937 --> 00:05:08,006
(The final round is reserved...)

125
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,906
(for only three crews.)

126
00:05:09,907 --> 00:05:12,806
(Semifinals. We're going to crush it, we're going to shake it.)

127
00:05:12,807 --> 00:05:14,316
(We will definitely be at finals.)

128
00:05:14,317 --> 00:05:15,717
(Global Artist Performance Mission)

129
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:17,047
(Hello, dancers.)

130
00:05:17,048 --> 00:05:18,546
(The global artist is Saweetie.)

131
00:05:18,547 --> 00:05:19,547
(This is insane.)

132
00:05:19,548 --> 00:05:21,086
(This is way more global than I expected.)

133
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,386
(I want you to interpret my music...)

134
00:05:23,387 --> 00:05:25,386
(into a compelling and creative performance.)

135
00:05:25,387 --> 00:05:27,527
(The song already suits AG SQUAD.)

136
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:28,896
(How do they do that?)

137
00:05:28,897 --> 00:05:30,196
(Amazed)

138
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:31,926
(Kaidi was such a diva.)

139
00:05:31,927 --> 00:05:34,466
(All of the team is wearing fake lashes.)

140
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,666
(They filmed the video that's playing on the LED screen.)

141
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:38,166
(Utilizing the LED screen)

142
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:40,066
(We're making the dumbbells.)

143
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:42,036
(Everyone is showing fierce determination.)

144
00:05:42,037 --> 00:05:43,506
(BUMSUP's secret weapon...)

145
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:44,507
(is me.)

146
00:05:44,508 --> 00:05:45,777
(Super K-pop)

147
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:46,976
(I bet Saweetie doesn't like it.)

148
00:05:46,977 --> 00:05:48,816
(I keep watching that. I want to be her.)

149
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:51,047
(This crew is...)

150
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:52,386
(Dance Film Mission)

151
00:05:52,387 --> 00:05:54,156
(The crews will take separate parts...)

152
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:57,016
(and create one complete dance film.)

153
00:05:57,017 --> 00:06:00,856
(The Global Public Evaluation will decide who gets the main section.)

154
00:06:00,857 --> 00:06:03,026
(This main section should be ours.)

155
00:06:03,027 --> 00:06:04,126
(We're definitely...)

156
00:06:04,127 --> 00:06:05,696
(making our way to the top.)

157
00:06:05,697 --> 00:06:07,436
(I already know what the results are.)

158
00:06:07,437 --> 00:06:08,836
(MOTIV will have the lowest view.)

159
00:06:08,837 --> 00:06:09,996
(BUMSUP will probably be 1st place.)

160
00:06:09,997 --> 00:06:11,806
(I think it's only natural that we're popular.)

161
00:06:11,807 --> 00:06:13,836
(Who wins over the hearts of the public and by how much)

162
00:06:13,837 --> 00:06:14,976
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's key player for the Dance Film Mission: Kyoka)

163
00:06:14,977 --> 00:06:15,977
(They're smart.)

164
00:06:15,978 --> 00:06:18,176
(Kyoka is has been gaining so much popularity these days.)

165
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:19,907
(Everyone else is a backup dancer?)

166
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:21,916
(She'll bring them views. Kyoka.)

167
00:06:21,917 --> 00:06:23,846
(Based on the Global Public Evaluation, )

168
00:06:23,847 --> 00:06:25,923
(the crew who will be taking the main section is...)

169
00:06:25,947 --> 00:06:27,016
(Gosh)

170
00:06:27,017 --> 00:06:28,757
(This is dangerous.)

171
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:59,747
World of Street Woman Fighter, the semifinals.

172
00:07:00,857 --> 00:07:03,617
Starting with the No Respect World Battle,

173
00:07:05,187 --> 00:07:06,187
the Class Mission,

174
00:07:08,157 --> 00:07:09,657
the World of K-pop Mission,

175
00:07:13,297 --> 00:07:15,497
and the Mega Crew Mission.

176
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:19,106
The four crews represented their countries...

177
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:21,377
and proved themselves through these missions.

178
00:07:21,937 --> 00:07:25,746
With their country's pride at stake,

179
00:07:25,747 --> 00:07:28,147
only three crews will make it to the finals.

180
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:29,876
We're representing Korea...

181
00:07:29,877 --> 00:07:31,516
and this is the semi-final round.

182
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,286
So it carries more weight.

183
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:36,416
We've lost the most amount of times compared to the other crews,

184
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:37,926
and we've experienced the Elimination Battle.

185
00:07:37,927 --> 00:07:40,657
But I think it made us that much stronger.

186
00:07:40,757 --> 00:07:42,726
We're very determined to win this mission...

187
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:44,926
because we don't want to go on an Elimination Battle again.

188
00:07:44,927 --> 00:07:45,927
Ever again.

189
00:07:45,928 --> 00:07:49,267
We're ready for what's next. Just keep it coming.

190
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:52,367
I will now reveal the semifinal mission.

191
00:07:53,737 --> 00:07:55,036
- It's here. - This is it.

192
00:07:55,037 --> 00:07:56,437
It's another challenge.

193
00:07:56,837 --> 00:07:59,977
The first mission of the World of Street Woman Fighter semifinals...

194
00:08:01,017 --> 00:08:03,547
is the Global Artist Performance Mission.

195
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,916
- We're doing it? - Yes.

196
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:07,387
A global artist.

197
00:08:08,017 --> 00:08:09,317
Does that mean it's not K-pop?

198
00:08:09,457 --> 00:08:12,187
A global artist? Okay. Come on, Bruno Mars.

199
00:08:13,487 --> 00:08:16,627
Hello, dancers of World of Street Woman Fighter.

200
00:08:18,027 --> 00:08:19,296
(I love her!)

201
00:08:19,297 --> 00:08:20,526
Saweetie?

202
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:22,096
(In awe)

203
00:08:22,097 --> 00:08:23,136
I love her.

204
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:25,037
- Saweetie? - That's crazy.

205
00:08:25,867 --> 00:08:27,306
Gosh.

206
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:28,307
This is amazing.

207
00:08:28,737 --> 00:08:30,337
It's Icy Girl, Saweetie.

208
00:08:30,537 --> 00:08:33,377
(Saweetie's many hits include "Best Friend," "My Type," and "Tap In.")

209
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:34,947
(She scored consecutive entries to the Billboard Hot 100...)

210
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,268
(and secured Grammy nominations.)

211
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,886
(Saweetie is known for her bold style and confident lyrics.)

212
00:08:38,887 --> 00:08:40,316
This is insane. Is this real?

213
00:08:40,317 --> 00:08:42,256
This is way more global than I expected.

214
00:08:42,257 --> 00:08:43,886
Saweetie is here?

215
00:08:43,887 --> 00:08:45,026
I love Saweetie.

216
00:08:45,027 --> 00:08:47,026
Her music is my vibe. I love it.

217
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,126
She's popular.

218
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,627
And having to do something for her is an honor.

219
00:08:51,727 --> 00:08:54,836
Just how big can Street Woman Fighter get?

220
00:08:54,837 --> 00:08:58,407
I had a clear vision and the ambition to follow through.

221
00:08:58,507 --> 00:09:00,106
I saw myself in your work.

222
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:02,106
You're artists who have proven themselves...

223
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:04,176
through and through, over and over again.

224
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:05,177
And I love that.

225
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:06,277
Period.

226
00:09:06,977 --> 00:09:08,547
This is insane.

227
00:09:08,747 --> 00:09:11,316
So I'm here on World of Street Woman Fighter...

228
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,686
to deliver a special mission.

229
00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:15,087
It's the Global Artist Performance Mission.

230
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,187
(Screaming)

231
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:20,256
(Here we go.)

232
00:09:20,257 --> 00:09:21,957
(This is so amazing.)

233
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:24,596
(I'm ready.)

234
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,636
The time has come to make ourselves known to her.

235
00:09:27,637 --> 00:09:29,297
We need to be fully prepared.

236
00:09:29,397 --> 00:09:32,566
We're very excited to see what the mission is...

237
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:34,337
and what the song is.

238
00:09:36,707 --> 00:09:37,946
(Focused)

239
00:09:37,947 --> 00:09:39,407
(Her body moves on its own.)

240
00:09:39,447 --> 00:09:40,847
I will shake it.

241
00:09:43,277 --> 00:09:44,286
It's giving "Shake it."

242
00:09:44,287 --> 00:09:45,447
(Let's shake it.)

243
00:09:46,487 --> 00:09:47,487
Love it.

244
00:09:47,657 --> 00:09:49,657
- I like this. - The chorus is great.

245
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:50,956
I have goosebumps.

246
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,687
We've got this in the bag. It's going to be nasty.

247
00:09:53,957 --> 00:09:57,866
So the moment we heard the song, we looked at each other.

248
00:09:57,867 --> 00:09:59,926
We were like, "Easy. This is our style."

249
00:09:59,927 --> 00:10:01,866
We'll shake our bottoms well...

250
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,936
with "Shake It Fast."

251
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,806
We'll be able to come up with the choreography quickly.

252
00:10:05,807 --> 00:10:08,376
I know how to tap into Saweetie.

253
00:10:08,377 --> 00:10:10,306
I'm looking for a one-of-a-kind,

254
00:10:10,307 --> 00:10:12,846
unique performance that sets the world on fire.

255
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:14,216
Signature performance?

256
00:10:14,217 --> 00:10:16,676
I want you to interpret my music.

257
00:10:16,677 --> 00:10:19,416
My persona, my vision, and my energy...

258
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:21,556
into a compelling and creative performance.

259
00:10:21,557 --> 00:10:25,226
I am so excited to see the unique performances you all create.

260
00:10:25,227 --> 00:10:28,496
Now let's begin the Global Artist Performance Mission.

261
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:30,356
Ready? Fight.

262
00:10:30,357 --> 00:10:31,597
I know that's right.

263
00:10:35,997 --> 00:10:37,336
(Let's go.)

264
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:40,266
I think our crew will be able to make Saweetie...

265
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:42,376
stand out the most.

266
00:10:42,377 --> 00:10:45,476
There are members who haven't shown their talents yet in our crew.

267
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:50,217
I think it's time for those members to shine.

268
00:10:50,647 --> 00:10:52,916
Can you see Ibuki doing this?

269
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:54,016
No.

270
00:10:54,017 --> 00:10:55,557
You might see her go like this.

271
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,156
So I think Ojo Gang is going to be the worst.

272
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:02,856
I mean, this song really suits AG SQUAD.

273
00:11:02,857 --> 00:11:05,626
We feel like we can kill this.

274
00:11:05,627 --> 00:11:08,196
When Saweetie watches our performance,

275
00:11:08,197 --> 00:11:10,266
I think she's going to come to realize...

276
00:11:10,267 --> 00:11:13,106
that we can "Shake It Baby" and "Shake It Fast."

277
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:15,076
(You just can't stop Marlee.)

278
00:11:15,077 --> 00:11:16,236
Saweetie and MOTIV crew.

279
00:11:16,237 --> 00:11:18,306
We'll be able to already have...

280
00:11:18,307 --> 00:11:20,276
a cultural understanding of each other.

281
00:11:20,277 --> 00:11:23,216
I believe that there are amazing colors and strength...

282
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:25,246
that only Asians have.

283
00:11:25,247 --> 00:11:26,986
I'm so confident in this.

284
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:28,556
Let's go!

285
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:30,256
This is AG SQUAD's style.

286
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:31,656
We have an advantage.

287
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,486
We need to win this mission...

288
00:11:33,487 --> 00:11:36,156
because we lost in Mega Crew Mission.

289
00:11:36,157 --> 00:11:39,997
This is our time to show why we're here.

290
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:41,896
(The day of the Global Artist Performance Mission recording)

291
00:11:41,897 --> 00:11:43,497
Good morning.

292
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,436
(A facial mask morning)

293
00:11:46,437 --> 00:11:48,177
It's already a hideout.

294
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:52,107
So today is the Global Artist Mission.

295
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:53,847
We'll tear it down today.

296
00:11:54,217 --> 00:11:56,246
I'm going to die.

297
00:11:56,247 --> 00:11:58,247
It's going to be a long day.

298
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,286
I'm honestly excited. I feel like...

299
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,516
it's a nice combination of...

300
00:12:02,517 --> 00:12:05,556
playfulness mixed with who we are.

301
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:08,857
Elements that I think Saweetie will really enjoy from us.

302
00:12:09,257 --> 00:12:10,756
We have US Saweetie.

303
00:12:10,757 --> 00:12:13,167
- Yes. Kaidi. - Everybody.

304
00:12:14,127 --> 00:12:15,267
Aaliyah in AG SQUAD?

305
00:12:15,697 --> 00:12:20,266
Hey, guys. It's Saweetie from AG SQUAD, Aaliyah.

306
00:12:20,267 --> 00:12:23,576
Her makeup is similar to how I like doing my makeup.

307
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:27,146
So I have my makeup. And then my hair.

308
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,547
I did it myself.

309
00:12:29,077 --> 00:12:31,246
I'm excited for you guys to see it.

310
00:12:31,247 --> 00:12:33,917
I'm going to kill this mission.

311
00:12:35,057 --> 00:12:36,986
Our Saweetie is you.

312
00:12:36,987 --> 00:12:38,626
You really are a star.

313
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:42,356
Thank you. I'm really thankful you made me do it.

314
00:12:42,357 --> 00:12:43,456
I really wanted to do it.

315
00:12:43,457 --> 00:12:46,597
- I naturally thought you would. - Right.

316
00:12:46,897 --> 00:12:48,936
She couldn't be more adorable.

317
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:50,636
I don't think any of our members...

318
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:53,567
can pull it off better than Leejung.

319
00:12:54,737 --> 00:12:56,876
Shake it shake it baby, shake it fast

320
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:59,546
I'm Saweetie today,

321
00:12:59,547 --> 00:13:01,747
so I'm trying to memorize the lyrics to the best I can.

322
00:13:03,247 --> 00:13:05,586
(She endlessly sings "Shake it.")

323
00:13:05,587 --> 00:13:07,546
Since I've become the main character,

324
00:13:07,547 --> 00:13:11,557
I did my best so I can stand out the most.

325
00:13:12,327 --> 00:13:13,757
You're amazing, Minami.

326
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,796
In this mission,

327
00:13:15,797 --> 00:13:17,826
the judge is Saweetie.

328
00:13:17,827 --> 00:13:21,196
Since I got Saweetie's position,

329
00:13:21,197 --> 00:13:23,096
I listened to the song a lot...

330
00:13:23,097 --> 00:13:24,843
since it's important to make something new out of it.

331
00:13:24,867 --> 00:13:26,206
Do you all know?

332
00:13:26,207 --> 00:13:28,206
There's a fun way to listen to songs.

333
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,606
- What? - What is that?

334
00:13:29,607 --> 00:13:30,607
(Demonstrating)

335
00:13:32,147 --> 00:13:33,747
What is it?

336
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:37,177
The code has been created.

337
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:38,847
Please scan it.

338
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:40,487
It came up.

339
00:13:41,457 --> 00:13:42,517
(Dancing)

340
00:13:42,787 --> 00:13:43,856
(It's fun.)

341
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:47,526
(Ojo Gang is charging with the Saweetie vibe.)

342
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,196
This is on trend these days.

343
00:13:49,197 --> 00:13:51,866
Thank you.

344
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:52,966
I want to do it too.

345
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:53,967
Nice.

346
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,636
Our youngest.

347
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:59,006
If you press the code part below, it comes up.

348
00:13:59,007 --> 00:14:00,336
(Teach us too.)

349
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:01,337
Then you can listen to it.

350
00:14:01,338 --> 00:14:03,736
I've also created the code.

351
00:14:03,737 --> 00:14:05,346
What do you think it is?

352
00:14:05,347 --> 00:14:06,806
(Junna comes.)

353
00:14:06,807 --> 00:14:08,916
Let's see what it is.

354
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:10,693
(What's the oldest sister Ruu's recommended song?)

355
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:13,487
(Their body reacts first to the song.)

356
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:16,016
(Ruu always thinks about OSAKA Ojo Gang.)

357
00:14:16,017 --> 00:14:20,056
Our song came out!

358
00:14:20,057 --> 00:14:23,557
(Ojo Gang is in high spirits with their theme song.)

359
00:14:23,757 --> 00:14:25,966
Everyone, today is the day...

360
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:28,866
Monika returns!

361
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:30,267
My sister!

362
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:31,967
My sister!

363
00:14:32,507 --> 00:14:33,836
She came back...

364
00:14:33,837 --> 00:14:36,576
looking like how she looked during Street Woman Fighter 1.

365
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:37,577
She's not changed.

366
00:14:37,578 --> 00:14:39,306
How many days has it been?

367
00:14:39,307 --> 00:14:42,816
- I think it's the 74th day today. - That's amazing.

368
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:44,916
You can't do that without willpower.

369
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,447
- Right. - It's tough.

370
00:14:46,717 --> 00:14:48,856
I'm not perfect, but I'll go with it.

371
00:14:48,857 --> 00:14:49,956
(Don't say that.)

372
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:51,326
You lack in nothing.

373
00:14:51,327 --> 00:14:52,827
Don't worry.

374
00:14:53,127 --> 00:14:54,856
We'll start the rehearsal.

375
00:14:54,857 --> 00:14:55,956
(The 4 crews are ready. They start the rehearsal.)

376
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:58,266
I need a

377
00:14:58,267 --> 00:14:59,926
You can play with it.

378
00:14:59,927 --> 00:15:02,797
(The dancers rehearse the song one last time.)

379
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:07,907
(The rehearsal proceeds smoothly.)

380
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:12,477
We killed it.

381
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:15,616
You look amazing.

382
00:15:15,617 --> 00:15:16,716
Thanks.

383
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:18,087
You're doing so well.

384
00:15:18,847 --> 00:15:20,217
I think this is good, Junna.

385
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:24,387
(The rehearsal continues in a warm atmosphere.)

386
00:15:26,227 --> 00:15:29,427
It's disappointing because I'm not yet at my best.

387
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:32,767
It's been a bit more than 70 days since I gave birth.

388
00:15:33,927 --> 00:15:36,566
Since I'm going onstage after some while,

389
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:39,066
I had many thoughts because there were many concerns.

390
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:40,107
I also had fear.

391
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:43,437
It took a long time to focus.

392
00:15:44,237 --> 00:15:45,807
It's tiresome for mothers.

393
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:47,277
That's right.

394
00:15:47,707 --> 00:15:51,146
I should do my best so I don't cause trouble for others.

395
00:15:51,147 --> 00:15:53,417
I thought I should put in my effort.

396
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:59,186
(The 4 teams prepared the Saweetie performance...)

397
00:15:59,187 --> 00:16:00,656
(with the determination to win.)

398
00:16:00,657 --> 00:16:03,827
(Which crew will captivate Saweetie's heart?)

399
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:07,096
(The 4 crews are back from the rehearsal.)

400
00:16:07,097 --> 00:16:08,097
(Hello.)

401
00:16:08,197 --> 00:16:09,966
(Saweetie, the original artist?)

402
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:11,706
I'm so excited to do this today.

403
00:16:11,707 --> 00:16:14,166
I saw the notes you sent over.

404
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:15,536
Thank you, Saweetie.

405
00:16:15,537 --> 00:16:18,246
Thanks for being part of this song.

406
00:16:18,247 --> 00:16:19,776
I was surprised.

407
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:22,246
Hi, nice to meet you guys. It was a really cool beat.

408
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,146
It was so cool and futuristic.

409
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:25,546
So thank you for making that.

410
00:16:25,547 --> 00:16:27,316
I'm really excited to see this choreography.

411
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:28,693
(A live video call evaluation by the music director and Saweetie)

412
00:16:28,717 --> 00:16:30,556
She's an international artist.

413
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,487
I'm really nervous.

414
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:36,297
Saweetie's condition would have an effect.

415
00:16:36,527 --> 00:16:37,597
Right.

416
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:39,666
I feel like it will highlight her.

417
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:42,466
If I were an artist, I would like what we've created.

418
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:43,467
Definitely.

419
00:16:43,697 --> 00:16:46,066
I feel like when Saweetie watches ours, she will be like...

420
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:47,206
(It's so good.)

421
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,207
Yes.

422
00:16:48,277 --> 00:16:50,537
- I'm excited. - Yes. I'm super excited.

423
00:16:50,837 --> 00:16:53,306
I really love how those girls were presenting themselves...

424
00:16:53,307 --> 00:16:56,246
through their glam.

425
00:16:56,247 --> 00:16:58,746
I'm looking for something...

426
00:16:58,747 --> 00:17:01,486
that has high energy, a lot of movement,

427
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,886
and a lot of hero moments...

428
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:06,226
where it makes you want to copy that dance move...

429
00:17:06,227 --> 00:17:07,756
when you're back at home.

430
00:17:07,757 --> 00:17:09,997
I really hope their personalities shine through.

431
00:17:10,357 --> 00:17:12,496
I'm really curious to see what part of the song...

432
00:17:12,497 --> 00:17:13,667
they'll be using as well.

433
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:19,836
We did a really good job of embodying this vibe.

434
00:17:19,837 --> 00:17:22,277
I can sense that Saweetie is really going to appreciate that.

435
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:24,337
Give it to us.

436
00:17:24,547 --> 00:17:25,676
Yes.

437
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:28,316
(Desperate)

438
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:31,787
As the only team representing hip-hop to a hip-hop song,

439
00:17:32,247 --> 00:17:34,047
I already know we're going to kill it.

440
00:17:34,317 --> 00:17:36,956
We're the strongest performance team right now.

441
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:39,156
I feel like we're well prepared.

442
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:40,686
And we're sick of losing!

443
00:17:40,687 --> 00:17:43,227
- We're sick of it. - We had it rough the last mission.

444
00:17:43,827 --> 00:17:46,396
Sick of it. Don't want it again.

445
00:17:46,397 --> 00:17:49,696
I absolutely feel very confident with this Saweetie challenge.

446
00:17:49,697 --> 00:17:52,206
We thought about what she would do,

447
00:17:52,207 --> 00:17:56,737
and we made it so she can just jump straight in and she will love it.

448
00:17:57,007 --> 00:17:59,347
This is Ojo Gang's front.

449
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:01,106
(Ojo Gang prepared for war...)

450
00:18:01,107 --> 00:18:02,146
(with their best.)

451
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,946
(Battle mode on)

452
00:18:04,947 --> 00:18:07,586
(They've put on their gangster visuals.)

453
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,616
I like this.

454
00:18:09,617 --> 00:18:11,727
(This is the highlight.)

455
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,187
I think we really have to get a win here.

456
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:17,227
I thought we won this.

457
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,626
Ours is very convincing and creative.

458
00:18:20,627 --> 00:18:22,097
It's something she hasn't seen.

459
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:24,097
I'm 100 percent confident.

460
00:18:24,397 --> 00:18:26,166
We did our best in preparing it.

461
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:27,236
We should just do what we practiced.

462
00:18:27,237 --> 00:18:30,806
Our biggest goal was to make her want to take up the challenge.

463
00:18:30,807 --> 00:18:33,446
I want her to be in a state where she's up for a challenge.

464
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:35,016
Right. For something new.

465
00:18:35,017 --> 00:18:36,546
I think it's going to be a close match.

466
00:18:36,547 --> 00:18:37,547
Right.

467
00:18:38,287 --> 00:18:41,616
I could imagine how much fun it is, being an artist myself.

468
00:18:41,617 --> 00:18:45,626
Preparation time that we go through to really give our all onstage.

469
00:18:45,627 --> 00:18:47,956
You want to make sure that we're in tip-top shape.

470
00:18:47,957 --> 00:18:49,026
So I can't wait to see it.

471
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,157
(She's excited.)

472
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:52,526
Thank you.

473
00:18:52,527 --> 00:18:54,666
(The all-black members enter.)

474
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:55,866
- Okay? - Okay.

475
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:56,896
(They're wearing black sunglasses, )

476
00:18:56,897 --> 00:18:58,766
(black lipstick, )

477
00:18:58,767 --> 00:19:02,136
(and black outfits.)

478
00:19:02,137 --> 00:19:03,906
Hello. It's Ojo Gang.

479
00:19:03,907 --> 00:19:06,546
- Thank you for today. - Thank you.

480
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:08,476
(There's a member in green who stands out.)

481
00:19:08,477 --> 00:19:11,986
(Saweetie Minami)

482
00:19:11,987 --> 00:19:12,987
(After the Global Artist Performance Mission was revealed)

483
00:19:12,988 --> 00:19:15,116
It's quite a difficult song.

484
00:19:15,117 --> 00:19:17,486
- The artist isn't Asian. - Right.

485
00:19:17,487 --> 00:19:19,126
It would be better to keep in mind...

486
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:21,126
the vibe and groove that she likes.

487
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:23,696
- That's right. - We're at a disadvantage.

488
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:25,266
In this situation, our crew...

489
00:19:25,267 --> 00:19:26,326
and the Korean crew...

490
00:19:26,327 --> 00:19:27,673
- are at a disadvantage. - That's right.

491
00:19:27,697 --> 00:19:30,596
It's a song that suits AG SQUAD well.

492
00:19:30,597 --> 00:19:32,967
So how will we bring that to our side?

493
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:34,707
Minami.

494
00:19:35,907 --> 00:19:36,937
Isn't it your style?

495
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:38,646
When I heard the song,

496
00:19:38,647 --> 00:19:40,946
Minami came to my mind.

497
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:43,777
I thought it suited her really well.

498
00:19:44,477 --> 00:19:46,816
Her fashion or makeup.

499
00:19:46,817 --> 00:19:51,427
Minami herself suited the color of the song very well.

500
00:19:51,827 --> 00:19:55,157
The expressions were very like her.

501
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,366
Cute, pretty, or sexy.

502
00:19:58,367 --> 00:20:01,467
Minami can show more than that.

503
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,707
I thought she was just the right person for this mission.

504
00:20:04,907 --> 00:20:07,566
I think the challenge is about how you can make...

505
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:09,737
the artist shine as an artist.

506
00:20:10,077 --> 00:20:11,476
Saweetie...

507
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:15,216
had many cute and poppy music videos.

508
00:20:15,217 --> 00:20:16,916
It was a song...

509
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:20,446
difficult for Ojo Gang to express in the first place.

510
00:20:20,447 --> 00:20:23,386
Let's not go with a cute style.

511
00:20:23,387 --> 00:20:25,586
Let's just go with gang.

512
00:20:25,587 --> 00:20:28,897
If we don't maintain this vibe,

513
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:31,726
I don't think she'll choose us.

514
00:20:31,727 --> 00:20:33,896
The most important thing in this mission...

515
00:20:33,897 --> 00:20:37,997
is to make the artist want to dance the choreography.

516
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:42,607
To do that, it's important that the artist stands out the most.

517
00:20:42,737 --> 00:20:46,076
We wanted to give Saweetie a challenge...

518
00:20:46,077 --> 00:20:48,576
with a new approach.

519
00:20:48,577 --> 00:20:50,277
Gang of Ojo Gang.

520
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:54,586
Gang's workout is our concept,

521
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,386
and we'll show our coolness...

522
00:20:57,387 --> 00:20:59,486
that expresses our strong will not to lose.

523
00:20:59,487 --> 00:21:01,456
We wore sunglasses...

524
00:21:01,457 --> 00:21:02,926
and wore black lipstick.

525
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:05,426
We had expressionless faces like spies.

526
00:21:05,427 --> 00:21:07,996
We also used dumbbells.

527
00:21:07,997 --> 00:21:12,606
We put a training move with dumbbells in the choreography.

528
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:13,607
A strong feeling.

529
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:16,836
It will be delivered tomorrow for sure, right?

530
00:21:16,837 --> 00:21:17,837
Yes.

531
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:19,807
We'll be in trouble if it doesn't.

532
00:21:20,407 --> 00:21:22,216
(And the trouble happened.)

533
00:21:22,217 --> 00:21:24,146
We couldn't prepare them until the end.

534
00:21:24,147 --> 00:21:25,316
(The dumbbells didn't arrive.)

535
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:29,486
There are dumbbells where we can adjust the weight by using water.

536
00:21:29,487 --> 00:21:32,026
That was hard to get in Korea.

537
00:21:32,027 --> 00:21:34,256
We ordered ones that could be delivered in one day.

538
00:21:34,257 --> 00:21:36,456
But they suddenly said they were out of stock.

539
00:21:36,457 --> 00:21:39,426
Hana and Kyoka urgently moved around...

540
00:21:39,427 --> 00:21:41,067
to get the materials.

541
00:21:42,737 --> 00:21:44,497
Spray bottles.

542
00:21:46,107 --> 00:21:47,567
We're making dumbbells.

543
00:21:48,277 --> 00:21:50,006
We attached two spray bottles.

544
00:21:50,007 --> 00:21:53,446
We wanted to make them shine, just how Saweetie likes it,

545
00:21:53,447 --> 00:21:57,477
so we wrapped a crystal sheet around them.

546
00:21:57,677 --> 00:22:00,187
- We're done. - We're done.

547
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:04,557
(They safely finished making the dumbbells.)

548
00:22:05,127 --> 00:22:07,426
A ghost is dyeing my hair.

549
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:10,126
I studied while watching her music videos.

550
00:22:10,127 --> 00:22:11,127
(Studying the artist)

551
00:22:11,128 --> 00:22:13,296
(Memorizing the lyrics to impersonate her perfectly)

552
00:22:13,297 --> 00:22:17,066
I memorized the English lyrics...

553
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:18,537
until 4am.

554
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:20,607
We will definitely win.

555
00:22:21,937 --> 00:22:23,636
We'll definitely win.

556
00:22:23,637 --> 00:22:25,006
(What will OSAKA Ojo Gang's Saweetie stage look like?)

557
00:22:25,007 --> 00:22:26,776
Yes!

558
00:22:26,777 --> 00:22:28,107
Goodness.

559
00:22:28,277 --> 00:22:29,316
(The day of the stage)

560
00:22:29,317 --> 00:22:31,117
Black lips? Shall we do it?

561
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,587
Who'd have thought we'd be wearing Kyoka's lipstick.

562
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,286
Do you use green or black?

563
00:22:37,287 --> 00:22:39,286
I look the worst with those colors.

564
00:22:39,287 --> 00:22:40,586
I look like I just came out of a swimming pool.

565
00:22:40,587 --> 00:22:42,526
(Black lipstick doesn't go well with Ibuki.)

566
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,896
(She tries the black lipstick.)

567
00:22:43,897 --> 00:22:45,726
(Pausing)

568
00:22:45,727 --> 00:22:47,397
Hurry up and apply it.

569
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:49,797
Should I do it for you?

570
00:22:51,607 --> 00:22:53,807
I'll do it. Do a countdown for me.

571
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:56,637
Three, two, one.

572
00:22:57,337 --> 00:22:58,377
Go.

573
00:23:01,207 --> 00:23:03,117
(Do I look okay?)

574
00:23:03,147 --> 00:23:04,667
It's like you're drawing on your face.

575
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:06,847
It feels awkward to use this color.

576
00:23:08,817 --> 00:23:09,956
You debuted.

577
00:23:09,957 --> 00:23:11,117
I don't like it.

578
00:23:12,327 --> 00:23:14,726
This color looks okay when you're like this.

579
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,496
(Smiling)

580
00:23:16,497 --> 00:23:18,427
Doesn't it look bad when I smile?

581
00:23:20,497 --> 00:23:22,337
It looks fine.

582
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,866
(Does it?)

583
00:23:24,867 --> 00:23:31,677
(The other members also apply black lipstick.)

584
00:23:31,907 --> 00:23:33,047
I'm the original.

585
00:23:33,207 --> 00:23:35,577
They all look natural with the black lips.

586
00:23:36,017 --> 00:23:38,786
With time,

587
00:23:38,787 --> 00:23:41,486
our teamwork increased as a crew.

588
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:43,486
We all became relaxed,

589
00:23:43,487 --> 00:23:46,286
and the team spirit was becoming really nice.

590
00:23:46,287 --> 00:23:47,807
I think it's going to be a good shoot.

591
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,256
As Saweetie,

592
00:23:50,257 --> 00:23:54,026
we approached it in a new way...

593
00:23:54,027 --> 00:23:56,796
by expressing that women also have a strong and cool side.

594
00:23:56,797 --> 00:23:59,766
I think our crew will be able to make...

595
00:23:59,767 --> 00:24:01,806
Saweetie stand out the most.

596
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:05,906
We're confident too. I think Ojo Gang will come in first.

597
00:24:05,907 --> 00:24:11,847
(How will OSAKA Ojo Gang express Saweetie?)

598
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:14,887
Okay.

599
00:24:15,017 --> 00:24:17,787
Who do you think is going to be Saweetie in Ojo Gang?

600
00:24:18,527 --> 00:24:20,487
Minami or Junna.

601
00:24:20,657 --> 00:24:22,156
(Agreeing)

602
00:24:22,157 --> 00:24:23,227
It would be Uwa.

603
00:24:23,327 --> 00:24:25,566
Uwa or Minami.

604
00:24:25,567 --> 00:24:27,073
I'm curious about Ojo Gang's performance.

605
00:24:27,097 --> 00:24:29,536
I'm so curious to see where Ojo Gang takes it.

606
00:24:29,537 --> 00:24:30,696
Yes. Same.

607
00:24:30,697 --> 00:24:32,437
Yes. That's going to be interesting.

608
00:24:32,707 --> 00:24:34,637
Give us that one, please.

609
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,307
(What performance will OSAKA Ojo Gang show us?)

610
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:39,647
- What? - Is it Kyoka?

611
00:24:40,177 --> 00:24:41,207
Kyoka.

612
00:24:41,277 --> 00:24:42,277
(No, it's Minami.)

613
00:24:42,278 --> 00:24:44,746
It's Minami!

614
00:24:44,747 --> 00:24:46,187
Period.

615
00:24:50,087 --> 00:24:52,557
- What? - What?

616
00:24:52,927 --> 00:24:53,987
She looks great.

617
00:24:55,857 --> 00:24:57,596
- It's her time. - Minami!

618
00:24:57,597 --> 00:24:58,626
Are those dumbbells?

619
00:24:58,627 --> 00:25:01,027
- Lifting weights! - That's funny.

620
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:04,666
That's a nice concept.

621
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:07,406
- That's really unique. - Goodness.

622
00:25:07,407 --> 00:25:09,207
- It's a great concept. - It's so pretty.

623
00:25:13,907 --> 00:25:15,017
They did a great job.

624
00:25:17,217 --> 00:25:18,447
Goodness.

625
00:25:19,047 --> 00:25:20,447
(They're being drawn to Minami.)

626
00:25:21,757 --> 00:25:23,887
This is a discovery of Minami.

627
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:29,897
She looks amazing. She has owned it down.

628
00:25:33,767 --> 00:25:35,637
She's so good.

629
00:25:39,967 --> 00:25:40,967
With the dumbbells.

630
00:25:40,968 --> 00:25:41,976
("Shake It Fast" with the dumbbells)

631
00:25:41,977 --> 00:25:44,406
Their showmanship is really good.

632
00:25:44,407 --> 00:25:45,507
I love them.

633
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,047
I love you.

634
00:25:53,317 --> 00:25:54,347
Love that.

635
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:57,087
They made the choreography very effectively.

636
00:25:59,827 --> 00:26:01,227
- Yes! - Yes!

637
00:26:02,927 --> 00:26:03,956
Yes.

638
00:26:03,957 --> 00:26:06,566
It's so nice how the other members are expressionless.

639
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:07,597
That's right.

640
00:26:09,037 --> 00:26:10,296
(This is it.)

641
00:26:10,297 --> 00:26:11,597
So amazing.

642
00:26:13,137 --> 00:26:15,307
- That's solid. - That was a cool effect.

643
00:26:18,907 --> 00:26:20,506
Riding with my crew.

644
00:26:20,507 --> 00:26:23,317
It goes so well with Minami.

645
00:26:27,317 --> 00:26:28,556
Can Saweetie do that?

646
00:26:28,557 --> 00:26:29,817
Is Saweetie going to do that?

647
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,327
- Yes, girl. - Nice.

648
00:26:33,887 --> 00:26:35,697
Okay. They got rid of the dumbbells.

649
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:36,727
Smart.

650
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,227
It was a great move that the other members are expressionless.

651
00:26:44,997 --> 00:26:46,037
Hey.

652
00:26:46,337 --> 00:26:47,367
That was nice.

653
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:49,536
(Thrilling)

654
00:26:49,537 --> 00:26:50,737
She is lit.

655
00:26:52,047 --> 00:26:53,377
Yes!

656
00:26:56,517 --> 00:26:58,117
(This is thrilling.)

657
00:27:02,417 --> 00:27:04,216
(Maximum power)

658
00:27:04,217 --> 00:27:05,427
Hit it!

659
00:27:06,027 --> 00:27:07,127
Yes, girl.

660
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:09,857
How are they so good?

661
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:12,097
Right?

662
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,427
Beautiful.

663
00:27:14,697 --> 00:27:15,867
She looks stunning.

664
00:27:16,797 --> 00:27:18,567
- That looks so cool. - Yes!

665
00:27:19,207 --> 00:27:20,767
They filled in everything.

666
00:27:24,407 --> 00:27:26,407
Ojo Gang. Seriously.

667
00:27:26,807 --> 00:27:28,947
OSAKA!

668
00:27:29,617 --> 00:27:31,476
Nice.

669
00:27:31,477 --> 00:27:32,647
Fire.

670
00:27:33,347 --> 00:27:36,816
I will admit this is like the most together as a team they've looked.

671
00:27:36,817 --> 00:27:38,827
- Yes. - Very true.

672
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:40,756
They're so stylish.

673
00:27:40,757 --> 00:27:41,926
So stylish.

674
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:43,096
- Very stylish. - Minami.

675
00:27:43,097 --> 00:27:44,996
Minami being in the middle...

676
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,166
- makes it look totally different. - Totally.

677
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:49,897
I think the dumbbells are so stylish.

678
00:27:50,397 --> 00:27:52,567
- It was a fresh concept. - Yes.

679
00:27:52,967 --> 00:27:54,707
But the artist...

680
00:27:54,937 --> 00:27:56,606
does a lot of work here.

681
00:27:56,607 --> 00:27:59,106
- The artist... - The artist does a lot of work.

682
00:27:59,107 --> 00:28:00,107
(She fills the stage with an active performance.)

683
00:28:00,108 --> 00:28:02,547
A lot of dancing for the singer.

684
00:28:02,677 --> 00:28:04,076
It looks like a lot...

685
00:28:04,077 --> 00:28:06,286
where there's no time to breathe.

686
00:28:06,287 --> 00:28:08,286
Appreciate her as an artist.

687
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:10,816
There's so much going on that it's like...

688
00:28:10,817 --> 00:28:12,686
You can't take it in completely.

689
00:28:12,687 --> 00:28:14,087
Yes. She was doing too much.

690
00:28:14,257 --> 00:28:15,327
- Yes. - Yes.

691
00:28:15,557 --> 00:28:18,326
And I actually appreciate their creativity,

692
00:28:18,327 --> 00:28:20,996
but overall, it was the wrong intention.

693
00:28:20,997 --> 00:28:23,766
- Yes. - When the lyrics are talking...

694
00:28:23,767 --> 00:28:24,996
about having fun...

695
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:26,937
and looking cute while doing it,

696
00:28:27,537 --> 00:28:30,636
she had a lot of aggression, and like...

697
00:28:30,637 --> 00:28:32,506
- "I'm going to kill you" vibe. - Yes.

698
00:28:32,507 --> 00:28:35,007
It was a little bit scary.

699
00:28:35,217 --> 00:28:36,217
Yes.

700
00:28:36,647 --> 00:28:38,116
What do you think she'll think of Ojo Gang?

701
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:39,686
- I don't know. - I think she'll appreciate...

702
00:28:39,687 --> 00:28:40,916
the creativity,

703
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:42,457
but I don't know...

704
00:28:42,817 --> 00:28:44,956
- if it will be her taste. - Yes.

705
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:47,087
- I don't think she'll like it. - Yes.

706
00:28:47,757 --> 00:28:49,097
I really liked that one.

707
00:28:49,397 --> 00:28:51,426
I'm very impressed.

708
00:28:51,427 --> 00:28:54,296
For one, they made me want to step my game up...

709
00:28:54,297 --> 00:28:56,536
because their stage presence was everything.

710
00:28:56,537 --> 00:29:00,136
I really loved the ensemble and their facial expressions.

711
00:29:00,137 --> 00:29:02,136
I loved how in every move,

712
00:29:02,137 --> 00:29:04,006
you could tell that she gave it her all.

713
00:29:04,007 --> 00:29:06,147
Sometimes, when I'm performing,

714
00:29:06,507 --> 00:29:10,046
the look is very like street, chic, sexy, and sporty.

715
00:29:10,047 --> 00:29:11,177
So I liked the theme.

716
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,916
I think that they took a piece...

717
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:15,586
of moments that I do have onstage...

718
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,616
when it comes to the costumes that I wear.

719
00:29:17,617 --> 00:29:20,457
So I definitely would wear something like that.

720
00:29:20,757 --> 00:29:22,997
I really love how they put themselves together.

721
00:29:23,727 --> 00:29:26,866
I really liked it. However, I did feel a slight...

722
00:29:26,867 --> 00:29:31,237
disconnect between some of the lyrics and some of the movements.

723
00:29:31,497 --> 00:29:34,707
I miss a little bit more of the sexy Saweetie vibe there.

724
00:29:34,837 --> 00:29:36,537
But yes, it was dope.

725
00:29:36,637 --> 00:29:37,936
Actually, now that you say that,

726
00:29:37,937 --> 00:29:41,307
one thing I really wanted to see was, when I say,

727
00:29:41,777 --> 00:29:44,146
"Bend it over. Make your knees touch your elbows..."

728
00:29:44,147 --> 00:29:46,616
(Bend it over. Make your knees touch your elbows.)

729
00:29:46,617 --> 00:29:49,486
I think I wanted to see the choreography to that moment.

730
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:51,117
So I see what you mean right there.

731
00:29:51,687 --> 00:29:52,687
Yes.

732
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:55,627
- Thank you. - Thank you.

733
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:58,997
Yes, it's over.

734
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:01,266
(OSAKA Ojo Gang members come down with satisfied faces.)

735
00:30:01,267 --> 00:30:02,596
(Well done.)

736
00:30:02,597 --> 00:30:03,966
Well done.

737
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:05,967
We really did our best.

738
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:08,336
We really united well this time.

739
00:30:08,337 --> 00:30:09,976
If that part was delivered well...

740
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:13,076
along with the impact and the creativity,

741
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,946
I think she will choose our choreography.

742
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:17,517
I really think we will be first.

743
00:30:19,147 --> 00:30:20,386
(Will OSAKA Ojo Gang be chosen by Saweetie?)

744
00:30:20,387 --> 00:30:22,317
I'm excited to see the other ones.

745
00:30:24,717 --> 00:30:26,287
The shoot is finished.

746
00:30:26,557 --> 00:30:28,126
Since we're done with it,

747
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:30,257
let's first remove these black lips.

748
00:30:31,257 --> 00:30:33,367
Today is the day everyone...

749
00:30:34,097 --> 00:30:36,437
tries black lips.

750
00:30:37,097 --> 00:30:38,806
(Smiling)

751
00:30:38,807 --> 00:30:40,807
Doesn't it look bad when I smile?

752
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:44,306
(Kyoka with the original black lips looks relaxed.)

753
00:30:44,307 --> 00:30:46,706
(She can't get used to the look.)

754
00:30:46,707 --> 00:30:47,747
I don't like it.

755
00:30:48,817 --> 00:30:50,316
Let's all remove it.

756
00:30:50,317 --> 00:30:52,147
Okay.

757
00:30:52,347 --> 00:30:53,447
Are you all done?

758
00:30:53,787 --> 00:30:55,916
We have new lip products there.

759
00:30:55,917 --> 00:30:57,693
There are many colors, and they're so pretty.

760
00:30:57,717 --> 00:30:59,156
(Let's pick.)

761
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:01,057
(Ojo Gang is recovering their color.)

762
00:31:01,587 --> 00:31:03,656
(It blends naturally on their lips.)

763
00:31:03,657 --> 00:31:05,527
It suits you so well.

764
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,926
(Focused)

765
00:31:07,927 --> 00:31:09,796
Isn't the glow nice?

766
00:31:09,797 --> 00:31:11,097
It's so pretty.

767
00:31:11,567 --> 00:31:14,407
- It shouldn't be sticky. - It's pretty.

768
00:31:15,137 --> 00:31:16,177
Bling.

769
00:31:16,677 --> 00:31:19,007
- It's so nice. - It's nice.

770
00:31:19,307 --> 00:31:24,477
(Ojo Gang's makeup time ends.)

771
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,786
Let's stand by.

772
00:31:26,787 --> 00:31:28,986
Yes. MOTIV.

773
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,656
Let's do this!

774
00:31:30,657 --> 00:31:33,686
They're our biggest competition with this challenge.

775
00:31:33,687 --> 00:31:37,156
They are from the US. Saweetie is from the US.

776
00:31:37,157 --> 00:31:38,726
(Hello, dancers...)

777
00:31:38,727 --> 00:31:40,367
(of World of Street Woman Fighter.)

778
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:42,096
(An American artist? Nice!)

779
00:31:42,097 --> 00:31:45,506
I feel like we'll be able to already just have a cultural...

780
00:31:45,507 --> 00:31:46,736
understanding of each other.

781
00:31:46,737 --> 00:31:48,037
Both Saweetie and MOTIV crew.

782
00:31:48,137 --> 00:31:50,836
When Saweetie watches our performance,

783
00:31:50,837 --> 00:31:52,776
I think she's going to come to realize...

784
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:55,617
that we can "Shake It Baby" and "Shake It Fast."

785
00:31:56,217 --> 00:31:57,347
(Keeping them in watch)

786
00:31:57,677 --> 00:32:00,046
Like a...

787
00:32:00,047 --> 00:32:02,007
(Marlee is doing a final check before the stage.)

788
00:32:02,757 --> 00:32:05,387
Kind of moving a little bit like this?

789
00:32:05,587 --> 00:32:08,586
- I'm moving like that. - Okay.

790
00:32:08,587 --> 00:32:09,597
Screwed.

791
00:32:09,797 --> 00:32:11,877
(The members are learning the choreography onstage.)

792
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:16,496
(They look more worried as the stage recording approaches.)

793
00:32:16,497 --> 00:32:21,007
This mission has actually been pretty challenging for my team.

794
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:24,037
Goodness. How am I going to do this?

795
00:32:24,237 --> 00:32:26,506
I think, you know, I just really...

796
00:32:26,507 --> 00:32:29,016
started to get into the mindset of potentially shaking it.

797
00:32:29,017 --> 00:32:30,516
But what does that look like?

798
00:32:30,517 --> 00:32:34,447
I don't really dance...

799
00:32:34,717 --> 00:32:37,657
to the style of Saweetie's music.

800
00:32:37,857 --> 00:32:40,187
Marlee, would you shake it at the center?

801
00:32:40,287 --> 00:32:41,726
Listen. It can shake,

802
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:44,197
but do I want to shake on television?

803
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:48,766
(A true hip-hop dancer, 23 years of pure style)

804
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:51,967
(Hip-hop Girl Marlee shaking it?)

805
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:53,167
(It's so funny.)

806
00:32:53,168 --> 00:32:54,637
(That will not happen.)

807
00:32:55,037 --> 00:32:56,576
I don't want to shake it.

808
00:32:56,577 --> 00:32:58,236
We do know that we have to shake it.

809
00:32:58,237 --> 00:33:00,046
And we have to shake it fast.

810
00:33:00,047 --> 00:33:01,176
(Laughing)

811
00:33:01,177 --> 00:33:02,976
Shake it. How can we make it shake?

812
00:33:02,977 --> 00:33:04,247
(Let me think.)

813
00:33:04,547 --> 00:33:05,686
(She's right here!)

814
00:33:05,687 --> 00:33:07,386
Yes!

815
00:33:07,387 --> 00:33:09,017
The right person would be Kaidi.

816
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:11,756
(She dances heavy hip-hop moves...)

817
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:15,087
(as well as soft moves, highlighting lines and flexibility.)

818
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:19,326
Like the overall look, and even her skin tone...

819
00:33:19,327 --> 00:33:22,066
I feel like she matches Saweetie the most...

820
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:23,397
out of everyone on our team.

821
00:33:23,837 --> 00:33:26,436
I am not afraid to tap into my feminine side.

822
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,767
So I feel like that's why Marlee felt...

823
00:33:29,177 --> 00:33:31,237
she could trust me to embody her.

824
00:33:36,877 --> 00:33:39,586
That strong energy exudes from Kaidi...

825
00:33:39,587 --> 00:33:41,846
as it similarly does from Saweetie.

826
00:33:41,847 --> 00:33:45,386
And Kaidi just absolutely rocked. An absolute star.

827
00:33:45,387 --> 00:33:47,386
(MOTIV is practicing.)

828
00:33:47,387 --> 00:33:50,826
(Marlee isn't around.)

829
00:33:50,827 --> 00:33:52,926
(Leader Marlee stops practicing and is in thought.)

830
00:33:52,927 --> 00:33:55,866
I feel like AG SQUAD is going to do really well.

831
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:59,436
Especially because Kyra and Kaea have so much experience.

832
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:01,036
I need to be strategic.

833
00:34:01,037 --> 00:34:04,136
So we can definitely get more cinematic...

834
00:34:04,137 --> 00:34:06,346
and visually playful.

835
00:34:06,347 --> 00:34:09,847
I'd want them to be... Well, it kind of...

836
00:34:10,517 --> 00:34:14,216
Utilizing the LED screens in an intentional way...

837
00:34:14,217 --> 00:34:16,387
would really help elevate our piece.

838
00:34:16,817 --> 00:34:21,256
I just came to the production team with all of my ideas.

839
00:34:21,257 --> 00:34:23,126
So it's like red here.

840
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:25,966
Completely black, and then spotlight.

841
00:34:25,967 --> 00:34:27,927
- Yes. Big eyes. - You mean in the video.

842
00:34:28,397 --> 00:34:30,936
And then, different parts.

843
00:34:30,937 --> 00:34:34,067
Eyes, and then the mouth like talking.

844
00:34:35,267 --> 00:34:36,736
- A body. - A body.

845
00:34:36,737 --> 00:34:37,807
But a silhouette.

846
00:34:38,037 --> 00:34:39,907
It was also another opportunity...

847
00:34:40,107 --> 00:34:43,076
for me to flex my directing skills.

848
00:34:43,077 --> 00:34:44,117
Okay. Kaidi,

849
00:34:44,217 --> 00:34:48,246
we have to go to a studio and record your face.

850
00:34:48,247 --> 00:34:49,457
I'll die.

851
00:34:51,717 --> 00:34:53,026
(The LED video shooting began quickly.)

852
00:34:53,027 --> 00:34:54,956
Try it, Kaidi. Action.

853
00:34:54,957 --> 00:34:56,457
Lick your teeth, Kaidi.

854
00:34:57,727 --> 00:34:59,296
Yes.

855
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:00,566
Do a little snarl.

856
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:01,966
(Kaidi expresses what Director Marlee instructs.)

857
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:02,996
Widen.

858
00:35:02,997 --> 00:35:06,206
Try to really enunciate.

859
00:35:06,207 --> 00:35:08,406
(Director Marlee demonstrates.)

860
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:11,006
Like really big.

861
00:35:11,007 --> 00:35:12,007
Okay.

862
00:35:12,807 --> 00:35:13,846
(How did I do?)

863
00:35:13,847 --> 00:35:15,146
(What is she doing?)

864
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:16,177
Let's go.

865
00:35:16,717 --> 00:35:17,717
(Kaidi's lip acting became natural.)

866
00:35:17,718 --> 00:35:18,777
Play with it.

867
00:35:19,787 --> 00:35:21,086
Yes!

868
00:35:21,087 --> 00:35:22,517
Let's do the eyes.

869
00:35:23,057 --> 00:35:24,116
Give a wink.

870
00:35:24,117 --> 00:35:25,117
(Winking)

871
00:35:25,118 --> 00:35:26,826
Side to side.

872
00:35:26,827 --> 00:35:30,956
This whole mission was just me being an actor.

873
00:35:30,957 --> 00:35:33,396
I had to act with my eyes,

874
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:35,466
and you can't really move the rest of your face.

875
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,496
You had to express it all...

876
00:35:37,497 --> 00:35:40,636
with your eyes or with your mouth.

877
00:35:40,637 --> 00:35:43,377
(Director Marlee is satisfied.)

878
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:46,706
(Our Saweetie Kaidi did it!)

879
00:35:46,707 --> 00:35:47,707
Ruthy.

880
00:35:47,907 --> 00:35:50,246
Can you like get this off?

881
00:35:50,247 --> 00:35:51,807
(There's a strand of hair on her lips.)

882
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:53,386
Get that hair off.

883
00:35:53,387 --> 00:35:56,217
Let me get you. It's like fuzz. I'm going to touch you.

884
00:35:56,517 --> 00:35:59,526
(Fantaye quickly appears.)

885
00:35:59,527 --> 00:36:00,886
To manage Kaidi.

886
00:36:00,887 --> 00:36:02,957
I killed it.

887
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,027
(She repairs boots.)

888
00:36:05,327 --> 00:36:07,826
Channel her. Yes.

889
00:36:07,827 --> 00:36:10,036
- Okay. - Hold on.

890
00:36:10,037 --> 00:36:11,936
(She's the top manager who even monitors her.)

891
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:13,437
Anytime, Saweetie.

892
00:36:14,737 --> 00:36:16,906
Yes. Saweetie.

893
00:36:16,907 --> 00:36:19,776
Yes. That was really nice of her to come along.

894
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:23,246
Her energy is just really nice to be around.

895
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:25,376
She took pictures and videos for me.

896
00:36:25,377 --> 00:36:27,316
She just helped out in any way that she could.

897
00:36:27,317 --> 00:36:29,016
She taped the bottom of my boots,

898
00:36:29,017 --> 00:36:31,556
she was helping with my touch-ups.

899
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:33,786
You know, I'm the team hype woman.

900
00:36:33,787 --> 00:36:35,056
I gave encouragement.

901
00:36:35,057 --> 00:36:37,126
I killed it. I actually should have gotten paid.

902
00:36:37,127 --> 00:36:38,127
(I'm joking.)

903
00:36:39,427 --> 00:36:41,226
Beyonce. Saweetie.

904
00:36:41,227 --> 00:36:43,367
Awesome.

905
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,237
Yes.

906
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:46,706
(Single Kaidi, not "Single Ladies")

907
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:49,537
Yes. Hands out to the side.

908
00:36:49,737 --> 00:36:51,577
Yes.

909
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:54,406
Seeing the close-up shots of her lips...

910
00:36:54,407 --> 00:36:56,516
and then the silhouette of her body...

911
00:36:56,517 --> 00:36:59,346
just really enforced the idea...

912
00:36:59,347 --> 00:37:02,217
that she was the star of this performance.

913
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:06,086
(The somewhat short and somewhat long shoot ends.)

914
00:37:06,087 --> 00:37:07,156
I think we're good.

915
00:37:07,157 --> 00:37:08,526
(Director Marlee is satisfied, and Kaidi is satisfied.)

916
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:09,856
When I go to the hotel,

917
00:37:09,857 --> 00:37:12,126
I can put it all together and send tonight.

918
00:37:12,127 --> 00:37:15,127
We're doing the absolute most right now.

919
00:37:15,397 --> 00:37:17,697
Nest that.

920
00:37:18,297 --> 00:37:22,507
Okay. And then, we copy.

921
00:37:23,137 --> 00:37:24,876
I just want you to see what's happening.

922
00:37:24,877 --> 00:37:27,176
(She checks the reference video.)

923
00:37:27,177 --> 00:37:28,647
That's cute!

924
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:32,377
I created a reference video to send to the team.

925
00:37:32,847 --> 00:37:35,416
(There's another weapon Marlee prepared?)

926
00:37:35,417 --> 00:37:36,417
(A headset mic!)

927
00:37:36,418 --> 00:37:40,887
I feel like when it comes to what we wanted to do...

928
00:37:40,987 --> 00:37:43,426
with showcasing the fact that you were the artist,

929
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,996
I didn't want to limit what you were able to do dance-wise.

930
00:37:46,997 --> 00:37:49,237
And I feel like people are also bringing back...

931
00:37:49,437 --> 00:37:51,036
the dancing pop stars.

932
00:37:51,037 --> 00:37:52,197
- Yes. - Yes.

933
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,066
I know. That's right.

934
00:37:55,067 --> 00:37:57,636
Just to make it a perfect performance...

935
00:37:57,637 --> 00:38:02,276
and just to really drive home the clear statement...

936
00:38:02,277 --> 00:38:04,346
of "Kaidi is a star, but in this moment,"

937
00:38:04,347 --> 00:38:05,646
"Kaidi is Saweetie."

938
00:38:05,647 --> 00:38:08,417
I hope that it turns out good. I'm really excited to see that.

939
00:38:08,687 --> 00:38:10,247
(It's time to check out the LED video.)

940
00:38:11,487 --> 00:38:14,186
- Yes! - That's good.

941
00:38:14,187 --> 00:38:15,427
Yes!

942
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:19,126
Let's go. Yes! They did it!

943
00:38:19,127 --> 00:38:21,727
They made exactly the same thing.

944
00:38:21,827 --> 00:38:24,536
I just really love the concept...

945
00:38:24,537 --> 00:38:28,966
using Kaidi's mouth, eyes, silhouette, and everything.

946
00:38:28,967 --> 00:38:32,206
I think that was such a good idea.

947
00:38:32,207 --> 00:38:35,007
I feel good about our piece, I feel good about the vibe,

948
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:38,416
and I feel like we're really embodying the overall feel...

949
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:39,616
of this song.

950
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:42,116
So I just wanted to make sure that everything we did...

951
00:38:42,117 --> 00:38:44,317
aligned with Saweetie's taste.

952
00:38:44,457 --> 00:38:47,657
See that we gave Saweetie.

953
00:38:47,757 --> 00:38:49,127
And I hope that they like it.

954
00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:53,596
I'm looking forward to seeing this group because...

955
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:55,426
the explanations were straight to the point.

956
00:38:55,427 --> 00:38:57,637
They don't say much, so maybe they're going to...

957
00:38:57,837 --> 00:38:59,637
show it up on screen.

958
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,607
Let's watch MOTIV.

959
00:39:01,837 --> 00:39:04,006
Yes. MOTIV.

960
00:39:04,007 --> 00:39:06,247
It probably will be great because this is theirs.

961
00:39:06,347 --> 00:39:09,106
Yes. They know America.

962
00:39:09,107 --> 00:39:10,787
(What will MOTIV's performance look like?)

963
00:39:13,887 --> 00:39:15,786
Denim and white shirt?

964
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:16,787
We won.

965
00:39:18,887 --> 00:39:21,187
- Gosh. - I have goosebumps.

966
00:39:21,257 --> 00:39:22,557
Crazy.

967
00:39:22,857 --> 00:39:24,326
She has a head mic.

968
00:39:24,327 --> 00:39:25,557
I should have used it too!

969
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:27,827
It's set for the artist.

970
00:39:28,527 --> 00:39:30,637
This is so good!

971
00:39:32,867 --> 00:39:33,867
Cute.

972
00:39:33,868 --> 00:39:35,006
(Focused)

973
00:39:35,007 --> 00:39:36,477
It's so cute.

974
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:38,576
They made it in a pop style.

975
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:41,107
They really use their facial expressions well.

976
00:39:41,877 --> 00:39:43,877
It's like an American music show.

977
00:39:44,277 --> 00:39:47,587
Saweetie could do this right away.

978
00:39:51,387 --> 00:39:52,657
This is good.

979
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,157
Period.

980
00:39:55,057 --> 00:39:57,127
The voice fits her so well.

981
00:39:57,427 --> 00:39:58,827
Look at the silhouettes over there.

982
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:01,496
Isn't that video in the back so cute?

983
00:40:01,497 --> 00:40:04,636
- Smart. - They made the video themselves.

984
00:40:04,637 --> 00:40:06,437
They made it very well for the LED screen.

985
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:08,666
It looks like she's really singing.

986
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:11,707
They fully understood the song since it's in English.

987
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,877
- Gosh. - Oh, my gosh.

988
00:40:18,317 --> 00:40:19,517
Let's go!

989
00:40:22,017 --> 00:40:23,617
- Gosh. - Oh, my gosh.

990
00:40:24,057 --> 00:40:25,787
It's something unexpected from MOTIV.

991
00:40:25,927 --> 00:40:27,427
This is really "Shake It."

992
00:40:27,527 --> 00:40:28,887
Logan is so cute.

993
00:40:29,657 --> 00:40:31,057
(Shake it with Saweetie)

994
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:34,767
Period.

995
00:40:36,237 --> 00:40:39,467
- Oh, my gosh. - Their facial expressions are cool.

996
00:40:42,337 --> 00:40:43,337
(Surprised)

997
00:40:43,338 --> 00:40:46,047
Her facial expressions are amazing and bomb.

998
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:49,646
Period! I like that.

999
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,047
Her hairstyle is cute.

1000
00:40:55,747 --> 00:40:56,757
That's cute.

1001
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:00,926
What I'm most surprised about MOTIV is that...

1002
00:41:00,927 --> 00:41:02,696
the formation is almost perfect.

1003
00:41:02,697 --> 00:41:04,356
The symmetry is always perfect.

1004
00:41:04,357 --> 00:41:05,926
Look at that. The perfect symmetry.

1005
00:41:05,927 --> 00:41:06,927
It's clean.

1006
00:41:10,737 --> 00:41:13,467
It's simple but pretty eye-catching.

1007
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:15,976
They choreographed it simply but amazingly.

1008
00:41:15,977 --> 00:41:17,477
I know. It's clean.

1009
00:41:20,507 --> 00:41:22,376
Oh, my gosh!

1010
00:41:22,377 --> 00:41:24,146
Yes! Shake it fast!

1011
00:41:24,147 --> 00:41:25,877
How can they all be pretty?

1012
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:30,587
(Shocked)

1013
00:41:31,017 --> 00:41:32,017
Like that?

1014
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:34,527
(Satisfied)

1015
00:41:35,027 --> 00:41:36,497
She's even acting.

1016
00:41:36,697 --> 00:41:37,897
She did it well.

1017
00:41:38,227 --> 00:41:39,627
That's Saweetie!

1018
00:41:39,867 --> 00:41:41,097
Smart thinking.

1019
00:41:42,697 --> 00:41:45,067
Okay, Kaidi. Let's go, Kaidi.

1020
00:41:48,267 --> 00:41:49,307
Their choreography is fun.

1021
00:41:52,137 --> 00:41:53,307
Confetti.

1022
00:41:53,647 --> 00:41:54,807
It looks like fireworks.

1023
00:41:57,317 --> 00:41:59,586
That's a performance!

1024
00:41:59,587 --> 00:42:00,587
It's clean.

1025
00:42:00,588 --> 00:42:02,017
I keep getting goosebumps.

1026
00:42:02,857 --> 00:42:04,086
Come on!

1027
00:42:04,087 --> 00:42:06,987
Oh, my gosh. MOTIV looks so cool.

1028
00:42:09,157 --> 00:42:10,456
Oh, my gosh.

1029
00:42:10,457 --> 00:42:12,097
This is "Shake It."

1030
00:42:14,797 --> 00:42:15,926
(Applauding)

1031
00:42:15,927 --> 00:42:17,467
(Looking at something)

1032
00:42:18,797 --> 00:42:19,837
(Her hand is approaching.)

1033
00:42:20,407 --> 00:42:21,407
(It hurts!)

1034
00:42:21,408 --> 00:42:24,306
- Look at MOTIV. They're acting. - Okay.

1035
00:42:24,307 --> 00:42:25,376
They're cute.

1036
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:27,146
I like that.

1037
00:42:27,147 --> 00:42:28,576
Period.

1038
00:42:28,577 --> 00:42:29,647
Great.

1039
00:42:30,317 --> 00:42:31,616
Oh, my gosh.

1040
00:42:31,617 --> 00:42:33,146
- Kaidi was crazy. - Yes.

1041
00:42:33,147 --> 00:42:34,147
That was crazy.

1042
00:42:35,287 --> 00:42:38,486
They could just go on a real stage.

1043
00:42:38,487 --> 00:42:39,756
It was like her song.

1044
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:43,396
They understood the assignment and executed as well as they could.

1045
00:42:43,397 --> 00:42:44,456
Yes.

1046
00:42:44,457 --> 00:42:47,966
It was different from what we've seen from MOTIV.

1047
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:49,636
(From an original American and charismatic hip-hop style...)

1048
00:42:49,637 --> 00:42:51,736
I'm impressed that MOTIV keeps...

1049
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:53,236
- challenging something new. - I know.

1050
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,406
But we're forced to keep challenging...

1051
00:42:55,407 --> 00:42:56,706
- something new. - They make us do that.

1052
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:57,707
That's so true.

1053
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:59,176
They look like they're enjoying it.

1054
00:42:59,177 --> 00:43:00,346
(If you can't avoid it, enjoy it.)

1055
00:43:00,347 --> 00:43:02,246
There was still MOTIV's vibe, though.

1056
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:03,946
It was an American style.

1057
00:43:03,947 --> 00:43:05,977
It was given LA.

1058
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,947
It looked like Coachella. Do you know what I mean?

1059
00:43:09,487 --> 00:43:12,716
I did actually like MOTIV's grabbing...

1060
00:43:12,717 --> 00:43:14,086
That camera. That was lit.

1061
00:43:14,087 --> 00:43:16,856
I really liked that she grabbed the angle.

1062
00:43:16,857 --> 00:43:19,596
I mean, how she grabbed the camera at the end, because...

1063
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,666
at the awards show, I grabbed the cameras.

1064
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:23,567
That was a cool Saweetie detail.

1065
00:43:24,137 --> 00:43:26,418
I really liked it, but it was something we've seen a lot.

1066
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:30,076
It was a performance that Saweetie would do.

1067
00:43:30,077 --> 00:43:32,706
It was fresh that MOTIV did this.

1068
00:43:32,707 --> 00:43:35,246
But the performance itself was...

1069
00:43:35,247 --> 00:43:37,716
It felt like I'd seen it somewhere.

1070
00:43:37,717 --> 00:43:40,446
If you hear that song, you'd expect something like that.

1071
00:43:40,447 --> 00:43:43,456
But this one's like, you did eat,

1072
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:46,056
but half of the plate is still there.

1073
00:43:46,057 --> 00:43:47,956
(The crews think it incorporates Saweetie's vibe but isn't creative.)

1074
00:43:47,957 --> 00:43:49,796
(What does the Saweetie think?)

1075
00:43:49,797 --> 00:43:52,326
You know, I think it's really interesting that...

1076
00:43:52,327 --> 00:43:54,426
with the angle farther, it kind of looked like...

1077
00:43:54,427 --> 00:43:55,796
like dance moves were repetitive,

1078
00:43:55,797 --> 00:43:58,596
but when you were able to get a closer look of their faces...

1079
00:43:58,597 --> 00:44:01,567
into the minor details, you were able to see the difference.

1080
00:44:01,867 --> 00:44:04,036
I can see that there are some facial choreo in there,

1081
00:44:04,037 --> 00:44:06,806
and how they convey their emotions. I really like that.

1082
00:44:06,807 --> 00:44:08,976
(She likes MOTIV's detail in expression.)

1083
00:44:08,977 --> 00:44:11,716
But I wasn't too crazy about the outfits.

1084
00:44:11,717 --> 00:44:13,746
The outfits that they were wearing were kind of stiff.

1085
00:44:13,747 --> 00:44:15,686
(MOTIV's simple outfits with a white shirt and jeans)

1086
00:44:15,687 --> 00:44:18,456
(But Saweetie prefers kitsch and vibrant outfits.)

1087
00:44:18,457 --> 00:44:20,556
I love when my dancers stand out.

1088
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:23,226
I wouldn't have worn that for my performance.

1089
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:25,596
If they just switched the outfits, the performance...

1090
00:44:25,597 --> 00:44:28,696
would've given more of what they were looking for.

1091
00:44:28,697 --> 00:44:30,336
(What would be the result for MOTIV?)

1092
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:32,496
- Thanks for the good work. - Thank you.

1093
00:44:32,497 --> 00:44:34,336
I'm feeling super confident.

1094
00:44:34,337 --> 00:44:36,376
Kaidi looked so good onstage.

1095
00:44:36,377 --> 00:44:37,877
Is Saweetie picking us?

1096
00:44:38,177 --> 00:44:39,177
Yes.

1097
00:44:39,477 --> 00:44:41,606
(The third one up is...)

1098
00:44:41,607 --> 00:44:43,146
(BUMSUP.)

1099
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:44,416
I did space buns today.

1100
00:44:44,417 --> 00:44:46,447
That means I'm totally awakened.

1101
00:44:47,617 --> 00:44:49,586
Please take your positions.

1102
00:44:49,587 --> 00:44:51,056
Oh, BUMSUP.

1103
00:44:51,057 --> 00:44:55,056
I honestly don't know what direction BUMSUP is going to go in.

1104
00:44:55,057 --> 00:44:57,556
How could they work with this song...

1105
00:44:57,557 --> 00:44:59,097
in a K-pop style?

1106
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:02,296
I feel like BUMSUP always comes up with great ideas,

1107
00:45:02,297 --> 00:45:05,066
so they're a big threat to us.

1108
00:45:05,067 --> 00:45:06,766
You know, I'm really excited for this one.

1109
00:45:06,767 --> 00:45:09,876
"Alice in Wonderland" was one of my favorite cartoons growing up.

1110
00:45:09,877 --> 00:45:12,106
So, I'm excited to see the interpretation...

1111
00:45:12,107 --> 00:45:14,306
mixed with, you know, the vibes...

1112
00:45:14,307 --> 00:45:15,847
we've created with this song.

1113
00:45:16,217 --> 00:45:19,546
So, what kind of Saweetie are we going to create?

1114
00:45:19,547 --> 00:45:21,216
When I heard the song,

1115
00:45:21,217 --> 00:45:23,416
- I could see what AG SQUAD... - They'd do it well, wouldn't they?

1116
00:45:23,417 --> 00:45:25,787
- would do right away. - You're right.

1117
00:45:26,327 --> 00:45:28,456
Only because the lyrics have the word "shake" many times,

1118
00:45:28,457 --> 00:45:30,796
if we do the movements...

1119
00:45:30,797 --> 00:45:33,466
that the artist usually likes,

1120
00:45:33,467 --> 00:45:34,926
we will have no chance of winning this.

1121
00:45:34,927 --> 00:45:37,636
I've been thinking a lot about which direction...

1122
00:45:37,637 --> 00:45:39,496
we need to take to interpret it.

1123
00:45:39,497 --> 00:45:40,906
So, I think...

1124
00:45:40,907 --> 00:45:43,906
we should do something other crews can't even try to do.

1125
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,306
- The outfits... - Yes, exactly.

1126
00:45:45,307 --> 00:45:47,006
And the style of choreography.

1127
00:45:47,007 --> 00:45:48,746
If you even look at the artist's logo,

1128
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:50,776
you see how colorful it is.

1129
00:45:50,777 --> 00:45:53,016
So, how about taking the colorful theme...

1130
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:54,446
to bring up kitsch vibes?

1131
00:45:54,447 --> 00:45:55,447
- Even the outfits. - I like it.

1132
00:45:55,448 --> 00:45:56,786
- That sounds good. - Kitsch vibes.

1133
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:58,986
In visual elements and choreography,

1134
00:45:58,987 --> 00:46:02,886
I thought it needed to be colorful for this song.

1135
00:46:02,887 --> 00:46:05,426
"Okay, we'll go that direction."

1136
00:46:05,427 --> 00:46:08,726
But we tried those color palettes...

1137
00:46:08,727 --> 00:46:11,366
on Lip J, Monika, and Honey J,

1138
00:46:11,367 --> 00:46:13,936
and when we imagined the whole picture, it was terrible.

1139
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,006
(Laughing)

1140
00:46:16,007 --> 00:46:18,606
I think our movements should be eccentric somehow.

1141
00:46:18,607 --> 00:46:20,476
It should be kitsch,

1142
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:22,706
quirky, and whimsical.

1143
00:46:22,707 --> 00:46:24,616
Being goofy.

1144
00:46:24,617 --> 00:46:26,386
"Alice in Wonderland."

1145
00:46:26,387 --> 00:46:27,647
"Saweetie in Wonderland."

1146
00:46:27,887 --> 00:46:30,886
Then, Leejung, you play the artist this time.

1147
00:46:30,887 --> 00:46:32,516
Let your imagination run wild.

1148
00:46:32,517 --> 00:46:34,156
- Leejung. - Go for it.

1149
00:46:34,157 --> 00:46:35,386
- When Leejung... - Thank you.

1150
00:46:35,387 --> 00:46:37,426
Works on a project,

1151
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:39,256
she studies the artist...

1152
00:46:39,257 --> 00:46:41,966
in detail, and that's really charming.

1153
00:46:41,967 --> 00:46:46,037
I think no one in my team can pull it off better than Leejung.

1154
00:46:46,437 --> 00:46:47,867
I'll do my best.

1155
00:46:48,507 --> 00:46:49,507
Thanks!

1156
00:46:49,777 --> 00:46:53,506
Be the star among all the Saweeties of the four crews.

1157
00:46:53,507 --> 00:46:55,506
I can definitely be the star.

1158
00:46:55,507 --> 00:46:57,146
I'm really confident.

1159
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,647
The secret weapon of my team...

1160
00:46:58,947 --> 00:46:59,947
is me.

1161
00:47:00,287 --> 00:47:01,416
- It would be fun... - Okay.

1162
00:47:01,417 --> 00:47:04,416
If we could show each of our characters this time.

1163
00:47:04,417 --> 00:47:07,926
The fact that each one has a different character...

1164
00:47:07,927 --> 00:47:10,996
is completely fine in the world of "Alice in Wonderland..."

1165
00:47:10,997 --> 00:47:12,726
or Saweetie in Wonderland.

1166
00:47:12,727 --> 00:47:14,826
This time, we tried to create a performance...

1167
00:47:14,827 --> 00:47:18,397
That highlighted our differences in an entertaining way.

1168
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:22,236
(BUMSUP's rehearsal studio)

1169
00:47:22,237 --> 00:47:24,537
- Five, six, seven, eight. - Five, six, seven, eight.

1170
00:47:25,337 --> 00:47:28,607
(The members of BUMSUP are practicing.)

1171
00:47:29,747 --> 00:47:31,317
What's going on?

1172
00:47:32,777 --> 00:47:33,886
Hi, Honey J.

1173
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,846
What did you bring?

1174
00:47:35,847 --> 00:47:38,216
For the new mission,

1175
00:47:38,217 --> 00:47:39,616
I prepared our uniforms.

1176
00:47:39,617 --> 00:47:41,027
I like it. We needed it.

1177
00:47:41,657 --> 00:47:44,026
- It's really pretty. - It's short-sleeved. So cute.

1178
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,027
It's so pretty.

1179
00:47:45,527 --> 00:47:46,596
It's really cute.

1180
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:47,796
This is so pretty.

1181
00:47:47,797 --> 00:47:49,196
(Happy with the leader's surprise gift)

1182
00:47:49,197 --> 00:47:51,296
- I love this. - It's pretty.

1183
00:47:51,297 --> 00:47:52,596
- That's really pretty. - Isn't it?

1184
00:47:52,597 --> 00:47:53,667
That's right. Like this.

1185
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:56,237
(Suddenly dancing together)

1186
00:47:56,637 --> 00:47:59,036
(Dancing lightly with a light jacket)

1187
00:47:59,037 --> 00:48:01,746
- We did it well. - It was nice, wasn't it?

1188
00:48:01,747 --> 00:48:03,046
Although it has long sleeves,

1189
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:04,346
- I feel cool. - I know.

1190
00:48:04,347 --> 00:48:06,146
This material is perfect to wear...

1191
00:48:06,147 --> 00:48:07,286
- from spring through fall. - You're right.

1192
00:48:07,287 --> 00:48:09,417
You look like a perfect model.

1193
00:48:09,547 --> 00:48:11,016
- You're so trendy. - Aren't I?

1194
00:48:11,017 --> 00:48:12,056
- You're so trendy. - It really looks..

1195
00:48:12,057 --> 00:48:13,486
- good on you. - Really.

1196
00:48:13,487 --> 00:48:16,397
(no: ze does better when she gets compliments.)

1197
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:18,897
(Yes, I be your woman)

1198
00:48:19,727 --> 00:48:21,726
It fits you well.

1199
00:48:21,727 --> 00:48:23,636
(The Rookie Class, Lip J and Hyojin Choi)

1200
00:48:23,637 --> 00:48:26,336
Oh, my gosh. Hey!

1201
00:48:26,337 --> 00:48:28,066
Oh, my gosh.

1202
00:48:28,067 --> 00:48:30,806
Let's practice hard in our uniforms.

1203
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:33,507
Yes! Let's go!

1204
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,816
(Working as Saweetie right away)

1205
00:48:36,817 --> 00:48:37,817
Where are we?

1206
00:48:38,317 --> 00:48:39,317
Over there.

1207
00:48:39,318 --> 00:48:40,417
(Smiling)

1208
00:48:41,117 --> 00:48:44,317
(The more they practice, the more confident they become.)

1209
00:48:45,087 --> 00:48:47,227
(In a good mood)

1210
00:48:47,527 --> 00:48:50,057
(The rehearsal studio with confidence)

1211
00:48:51,197 --> 00:48:56,126
(Everything is ready!)

1212
00:48:56,127 --> 00:48:57,236
(Performance day)

1213
00:48:57,237 --> 00:48:59,136
I've never done such a thing.

1214
00:48:59,137 --> 00:49:01,706
I never thought to take on a concept like this in my dance career.

1215
00:49:01,707 --> 00:49:02,907
- Me neither. - Me neither.

1216
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,336
- Me neither. - I've never done such a thing.

1217
00:49:05,337 --> 00:49:07,406
- I've never done it either. - It's my first time too.

1218
00:49:07,407 --> 00:49:09,146
I've never worn anything this pink.

1219
00:49:09,147 --> 00:49:11,276
It's the 1st time I've worn 2 shorts at once in my life.

1220
00:49:11,277 --> 00:49:13,216
Look at what Aiki is wearing.

1221
00:49:13,217 --> 00:49:15,777
I'll get in trouble with my mom for wearing something like this.

1222
00:49:16,017 --> 00:49:17,286
This belt.

1223
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:18,986
Yes. I'll be in trouble.

1224
00:49:18,987 --> 00:49:21,756
We're dressed up like this to look like the rabbits...

1225
00:49:21,757 --> 00:49:23,856
- in "Alice in Wonderland." - That's right.

1226
00:49:23,857 --> 00:49:26,296
That's right. Somehow, we look like a clown.

1227
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,526
It's quirky, and I like it.

1228
00:49:27,527 --> 00:49:29,196
Because of how I'm dressed up,

1229
00:49:29,197 --> 00:49:31,936
I tried to smile a lot, although I looked a bit serious.

1230
00:49:31,937 --> 00:49:33,243
(Getting familiar with the Wonderland)

1231
00:49:33,267 --> 00:49:36,266
- We'll do the blocking rehearsal. - Yes.

1232
00:49:36,267 --> 00:49:38,036
- Monika. - We'll try it just once.

1233
00:49:38,037 --> 00:49:39,076
Sure.

1234
00:49:39,077 --> 00:49:40,376
Ready and go.

1235
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:42,106
(Monika and Lip J are rehearsing the pair dance.)

1236
00:49:42,107 --> 00:49:45,946
We'll have a Molip performance in the bridge section.

1237
00:49:45,947 --> 00:49:49,116
We haven't performed as Molip for a long time.

1238
00:49:49,117 --> 00:49:52,156
Molip was a dance team that focused on storytelling.

1239
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:53,626
It came across Honey J's...

1240
00:49:53,627 --> 00:49:55,026
and my mind suddenly.

1241
00:49:55,027 --> 00:49:56,027
(Purplow about 15 years ago)

1242
00:49:56,028 --> 00:49:58,956
We wanted to maximize the fairytale feel...

1243
00:49:58,957 --> 00:50:00,096
by adapting the style of Molip,

1244
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:03,267
a team that Monika and Lip J were on back in the day.

1245
00:50:03,537 --> 00:50:06,736
The choreography incorporated a lot of whimsical movements,

1246
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:08,113
and they wanted to bring that into this performance.

1247
00:50:08,137 --> 00:50:11,677
I tried to portray time travel to the past.

1248
00:50:13,037 --> 00:50:14,547
(Stumbling)

1249
00:50:14,677 --> 00:50:17,376
(The movements are not quite smooth.)

1250
00:50:17,377 --> 00:50:19,377
I was so nervous while doing the Molip part.

1251
00:50:19,847 --> 00:50:21,246
It's been a really long time...

1252
00:50:21,247 --> 00:50:23,617
since the last time Lip J and I danced in a pair.

1253
00:50:23,757 --> 00:50:24,757
Ready and go.

1254
00:50:24,758 --> 00:50:26,478
(Continuing to practice the pair movements)

1255
00:50:26,927 --> 00:50:28,587
I didn't spread my legs enough.

1256
00:50:28,987 --> 00:50:31,656
Ready and go.

1257
00:50:31,657 --> 00:50:33,726
(Trying it again)

1258
00:50:33,727 --> 00:50:34,966
Ready and go.

1259
00:50:34,967 --> 00:50:36,197
(Trying it over and over)

1260
00:50:36,597 --> 00:50:39,136
(Lost in trying to rekindle the Molip chemistry in 15 years)

1261
00:50:39,137 --> 00:50:42,166
Since we danced with our bodies close to each other,

1262
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:45,706
she was probably feeling a lot of pressure.

1263
00:50:45,707 --> 00:50:48,547
I felt so bad for her.

1264
00:50:51,547 --> 00:50:55,087
(She couldn't do the movements as well as she wanted.)

1265
00:50:55,717 --> 00:50:58,586
It's actually a big challenge for me.

1266
00:50:58,587 --> 00:51:01,226
Since this is my first real performance with them,

1267
00:51:01,227 --> 00:51:03,727
I just wanted to keep up with them.

1268
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:05,426
(Monitoring Molip's rehearsal)

1269
00:51:05,427 --> 00:51:07,796
- I love it. - It's so cute.

1270
00:51:07,797 --> 00:51:09,996
- Honey J. When the clock showed, - There's no need to feel rushed.

1271
00:51:09,997 --> 00:51:12,113
- it was so Alice in Wonderland. - Turning back to ten years ago.

1272
00:51:12,137 --> 00:51:13,536
I felt like turning back to ten years ago.

1273
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:14,706
It really looked like a fairytale.

1274
00:51:14,707 --> 00:51:16,036
Molip.

1275
00:51:16,037 --> 00:51:18,077
- It's great. - Moms are strong.

1276
00:51:18,107 --> 00:51:21,047
They're supporting me with what I'm going through.

1277
00:51:21,447 --> 00:51:22,507
I feel grateful.

1278
00:51:22,877 --> 00:51:25,216
I think when we really enjoy the performance,

1279
00:51:25,217 --> 00:51:26,946
it can be conveyed to the viewers.

1280
00:51:26,947 --> 00:51:29,086
I had so much fun.

1281
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:31,356
- When we applaud at the end, - When we do this...

1282
00:51:31,357 --> 00:51:33,556
let's laugh out loud like this.

1283
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:35,657
They applaud me at the end.

1284
00:51:37,397 --> 00:51:40,196
I'm confident that Saweetie will be surprised...

1285
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:42,196
by how her song was interpreted.

1286
00:51:42,197 --> 00:51:44,696
I believe it was a really honest performance,

1287
00:51:44,697 --> 00:51:48,006
so I think she'll love it.

1288
00:51:48,007 --> 00:51:50,768
- With the tiger's spirit, BUMSUP! - With the tiger's spirit, BUMSUP!

1289
00:51:50,877 --> 00:51:51,877
Let's go!

1290
00:51:51,878 --> 00:51:54,318
(How will BUMSUP's take on Saweetie's performance look like?)

1291
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,107
- BUMSUP? - Let's see.

1292
00:51:56,507 --> 00:51:57,516
BUMSUP.

1293
00:51:57,517 --> 00:51:59,217
Who did BUMSUP's Saweetie?

1294
00:51:59,577 --> 00:52:00,617
Leejung.

1295
00:52:00,787 --> 00:52:03,016
I did think about Leejung potentially.

1296
00:52:03,017 --> 00:52:06,216
I feel like BUMSUP is going to do really well.

1297
00:52:06,217 --> 00:52:07,686
- I'm sure it'll be Leejung... - Yes.

1298
00:52:07,687 --> 00:52:09,087
- among them. - Yes.

1299
00:52:09,487 --> 00:52:12,826
If Saweetie likes K-pop style,

1300
00:52:12,827 --> 00:52:14,766
BUMSUP will probably receive positive reviews.

1301
00:52:14,767 --> 00:52:16,167
I have butterflies.

1302
00:52:17,037 --> 00:52:18,197
I'm shaking.

1303
00:52:18,497 --> 00:52:19,567
Okay.

1304
00:52:20,507 --> 00:52:21,536
(Concept Paper)

1305
00:52:21,537 --> 00:52:23,483
(The concept of the choreography inspired by Alice in Wonderland.)

1306
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:25,306
You know, I'm really excited for this one.

1307
00:52:25,307 --> 00:52:28,276
"Alice in Wonderland" is one of my favorite cartoons growing up,

1308
00:52:28,277 --> 00:52:31,716
so I'm excited to see the interpretation mixed with...

1309
00:52:31,717 --> 00:52:34,387
the vibes we've created with this song.

1310
00:52:35,047 --> 00:52:37,057
(Who is going to be Saweetie in BUMSUP?)

1311
00:52:38,817 --> 00:52:40,087
Is she Saweetie?

1312
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,057
(Hyojin Choi?)

1313
00:52:44,627 --> 00:52:47,826
("Shake It Fast" by Saweetie, Choreography by BUMSUP)

1314
00:52:47,827 --> 00:52:48,897
She's here.

1315
00:52:49,467 --> 00:52:50,467
Leejung.

1316
00:52:50,468 --> 00:52:51,708
(BUMSUP's Saweetie is Leejung.)

1317
00:52:52,067 --> 00:52:53,367
- Yes. - Leejung.

1318
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:54,807
She's cute.

1319
00:52:55,407 --> 00:52:56,707
It's super cute.

1320
00:52:59,407 --> 00:53:00,947
It's giving very K-pop.

1321
00:53:03,007 --> 00:53:04,017
She's good.

1322
00:53:08,617 --> 00:53:09,817
They're cute.

1323
00:53:12,157 --> 00:53:13,927
She's done a well job.

1324
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:16,287
- I like her little acting. - Yes.

1325
00:53:19,057 --> 00:53:20,097
Spotlight.

1326
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:22,227
No.

1327
00:53:23,097 --> 00:53:24,257
I don't know what's going on.

1328
00:53:27,107 --> 00:53:29,207
- Hey. - She's good.

1329
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:31,536
Come on.

1330
00:53:31,537 --> 00:53:33,577
Yes, go on!

1331
00:53:34,407 --> 00:53:36,047
It's K-pop.

1332
00:53:37,477 --> 00:53:38,677
They're cute.

1333
00:53:41,687 --> 00:53:43,086
(Making her heart flutter.)

1334
00:53:43,087 --> 00:53:44,257
(Falling into it)

1335
00:53:46,787 --> 00:53:47,827
Okay.

1336
00:53:48,027 --> 00:53:50,627
- Yes. This is so good. - Yes.

1337
00:53:50,997 --> 00:53:52,226
Okay. Concept.

1338
00:53:52,227 --> 00:53:53,397
(Concentrating)

1339
00:53:56,167 --> 00:53:57,167
I like that.

1340
00:54:02,367 --> 00:54:04,536
- It feels like a music video. - It does.

1341
00:54:04,537 --> 00:54:06,777
This will be a cool music video.

1342
00:54:10,317 --> 00:54:12,447
- Slay. - Come on.

1343
00:54:15,247 --> 00:54:16,417
(Smiling)

1344
00:54:16,617 --> 00:54:17,987
BUMSUP is really good.

1345
00:54:21,187 --> 00:54:23,927
- Super K-pop. - Yes, very K-pop.

1346
00:54:26,327 --> 00:54:27,327
She's cute.

1347
00:54:30,297 --> 00:54:32,936
Didn't everyone go colorful like that?

1348
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:34,907
- Those vibrant colors? - Yes, that's right.

1349
00:54:35,507 --> 00:54:37,237
I thought no one would go with black.

1350
00:54:37,337 --> 00:54:38,377
(Exactly)

1351
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,547
Let's go, Hyojin Choi.

1352
00:54:52,217 --> 00:54:53,686
(Thrilling)

1353
00:54:53,687 --> 00:54:56,057
That was smooth.

1354
00:54:56,087 --> 00:54:57,257
Cute.

1355
00:54:59,257 --> 00:55:01,067
Period. Knee slide.

1356
00:55:01,297 --> 00:55:03,736
It's really K-pop style...

1357
00:55:03,737 --> 00:55:05,037
from start to end.

1358
00:55:09,537 --> 00:55:10,837
It is Monika.

1359
00:55:13,647 --> 00:55:15,107
It's giving contemporary.

1360
00:55:16,277 --> 00:55:17,417
That's the part in pairs.

1361
00:55:18,277 --> 00:55:20,347
- I like this part. - The bridge part.

1362
00:55:21,417 --> 00:55:23,187
(I love it.)

1363
00:55:24,217 --> 00:55:25,757
Yes, Lip J.

1364
00:55:26,417 --> 00:55:29,126
They had a lot of moments where the other members were centered.

1365
00:55:29,127 --> 00:55:30,197
Exactly.

1366
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:38,596
I feel like they did everything we just said.

1367
00:55:38,597 --> 00:55:40,437
- They did everything we said. - Yes.

1368
00:55:42,467 --> 00:55:43,807
She's cute.

1369
00:55:45,277 --> 00:55:46,437
(Nervous)

1370
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:51,947
I like that.

1371
00:55:54,187 --> 00:55:55,217
I like this.

1372
00:55:57,517 --> 00:55:59,887
- All of them are so good. - That was super giving.

(Listen to it on Spotify.)

1375
00:56:06,097 --> 00:56:08,097
- Cute. - That was cute.

1376
00:56:08,827 --> 00:56:10,837
- It was cute. - It was so cute.

1377
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,607
Let me tell you about my girl, Leejung.

(Impressed)

1379
00:56:16,107 --> 00:56:17,937
- This is so good. - Okay. Let's go back.

1380
00:56:18,337 --> 00:56:19,406
Okay.

1381
00:56:19,407 --> 00:56:22,347
It's totally different!

1382
00:56:22,877 --> 00:56:24,577
Wait a moment.

1383
00:56:24,677 --> 00:56:26,477
Was it the same mission?

1384
00:56:26,817 --> 00:56:28,687
(Same music but different world)

1385
00:56:28,817 --> 00:56:30,656
It's very pop.

1386
00:56:30,657 --> 00:56:32,716
It felt like American pop.

1387
00:56:32,717 --> 00:56:34,826
- It was cute. - It was a cute style.

1388
00:56:34,827 --> 00:56:36,996
It was good, and Leejung did amazing.

1389
00:56:36,997 --> 00:56:38,826
- She was a star. - Yes.

1390
00:56:38,827 --> 00:56:39,827
What do you guys think?

1391
00:56:40,827 --> 00:56:45,567
They knew that they couldn't touch...

1392
00:56:45,867 --> 00:56:49,936
the hotness of, you know, that essence.

1393
00:56:49,937 --> 00:56:52,236
- Because they knew we could do it. - Yes.

1394
00:56:52,237 --> 00:56:54,606
So, they went the other route and went...

1395
00:56:54,607 --> 00:56:56,246
- cute. - That's strategic.

1396
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:59,246
I feel like because Saweetie is a hip-hop artist,

1397
00:56:59,247 --> 00:57:01,286
they didn't seem like a hip-hop group.

1398
00:57:01,287 --> 00:57:04,286
They didn't seem like background dancers for a hip-hop track.

1399
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:07,486
It seemed like a K-pop group when I was watching them dance.

1400
00:57:07,487 --> 00:57:09,857
And I feel like that wasn't...

1401
00:57:10,027 --> 00:57:11,097
No.

1402
00:57:11,297 --> 00:57:14,267
I guess it's a good thing they came unexpected, but...

1403
00:57:14,797 --> 00:57:16,727
Has it pulled through?

1404
00:57:17,337 --> 00:57:18,537
Yes. And, plus...

1405
00:57:19,267 --> 00:57:22,267
Let me tell you about this girl!

1406
00:57:23,207 --> 00:57:24,407
Oh, my gosh.

1407
00:57:24,577 --> 00:57:27,006
While watching that, I wanted to be her.

1408
00:57:27,007 --> 00:57:28,606
There was another member in the center,

1409
00:57:28,607 --> 00:57:30,846
but then she was still the main character.

1410
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:32,546
That was translated so well.

1411
00:57:32,547 --> 00:57:34,847
Even though the other people were standing in the front,

1412
00:57:35,247 --> 00:57:37,287
she was always the main character.

1413
00:57:37,617 --> 00:57:39,816
By the way, she moved her body, her presence,

1414
00:57:39,817 --> 00:57:42,286
her facial expressions, her makeup, and her hair.

1415
00:57:42,287 --> 00:57:44,426
Everything was just so beautiful.

1416
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:47,827
I feel like one thing about me is I do have...

1417
00:57:48,197 --> 00:57:50,636
different emotions and different moves.

1418
00:57:50,637 --> 00:57:52,197
And I like how she played with that.

1419
00:57:52,797 --> 00:57:54,566
There were times she was sweet.

1420
00:57:54,567 --> 00:57:55,966
There were times she was sexy.

1421
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:57,536
There were times she was aggressive.

1422
00:57:57,537 --> 00:57:59,536
There were just so many moments where...

1423
00:57:59,537 --> 00:58:01,376
it made her a dynamic character.

1424
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:04,077
- They killed this. - They killed that. Yes.

1425
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:05,747
I just...

1426
00:58:06,677 --> 00:58:09,187
I'm paying to go watch that. I liked that.

1427
00:58:09,447 --> 00:58:13,086
I'd pay for their merch. I'd pay for whatever makeup they're selling.

1428
00:58:13,087 --> 00:58:16,156
Whatever the brand deals are. I'm tuned in. I'm tapped in.

1429
00:58:16,157 --> 00:58:17,157
Take my coin.

1430
00:58:17,158 --> 00:58:20,127
I love BUMSUP. I'm a BUMSUP girl now.

1431
00:58:20,827 --> 00:58:22,926
And I love their intro song.

1432
00:58:22,927 --> 00:58:25,636
BUMSUP.

1433
00:58:25,637 --> 00:58:27,437
(I like that.)

1434
00:58:29,607 --> 00:58:32,836
There were many elements to it.

1435
00:58:32,837 --> 00:58:35,946
It was an entertaining performance with a lot to watch.

1436
00:58:35,947 --> 00:58:37,076
I think she will like it.

1437
00:58:37,077 --> 00:58:38,477
(Will Saweetie choose BUMSUP?)

1438
00:58:38,747 --> 00:58:40,846
- Who's it going to be? Oh, my gosh. - AG Squad.

1439
00:58:40,847 --> 00:58:41,887
Who's it going to be?

1440
00:58:42,647 --> 00:58:43,647
- They are going to be like this. - Yes.

1441
00:58:43,648 --> 00:58:45,487
(Mimicking AG SQUAD)

1442
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:48,686
(From the leader...)

1443
00:58:48,687 --> 00:58:50,186
(to the rookies, they're amazing with their facial expressions. )

1444
00:58:50,187 --> 00:58:51,957
They're best at facial expressions.

1445
00:58:52,597 --> 00:58:54,343
I think they'll do what they usually do, though.

1446
00:58:54,367 --> 00:58:57,567
I don't think they'd tweak something, to be honest.

1447
00:58:58,467 --> 00:59:00,066
AG SQUAD is going to bring a lot of...

1448
00:59:00,067 --> 00:59:01,107
(Shake it)

1449
00:59:01,207 --> 00:59:03,037
I'd love to see what they're bringing.

1450
00:59:04,077 --> 00:59:06,477
(AG SQUAD is getting ready to perform.)

1451
00:59:06,577 --> 00:59:08,646
Hi, guys. We're AG SQUAD.

1452
00:59:08,647 --> 00:59:11,346
And for our concept, we wanted to just...

1453
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:13,316
Our concept is pretty much Saweetie.

1454
00:59:13,317 --> 00:59:17,957
I'm excited that AG SQUAD gets to showcase something new again.

1455
00:59:19,257 --> 00:59:20,927
I mean, it was an emotional day.

1456
00:59:21,127 --> 00:59:23,827
Even though it was a massive hit to the gut,

1457
00:59:24,097 --> 00:59:25,556
we were coming last from Mega Crew Mission...

1458
00:59:25,557 --> 00:59:26,827
when we shouldn't have.

1459
00:59:27,027 --> 00:59:28,467
(Crying)

1460
00:59:28,727 --> 00:59:31,066
The crew that ranks the lowest on this mission.

1461
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:33,297
(AG SQUAD ranked 5th in the Mega Crew Mission.)

1462
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:36,706
That was just pure disappointment.

1463
00:59:36,707 --> 00:59:38,077
A frustrated cry.

1464
00:59:38,277 --> 00:59:39,377
I hate this.

1465
00:59:39,607 --> 00:59:42,047
It just left a bad taste in my mouth about...

1466
00:59:42,307 --> 00:59:44,447
And then something sparked a fire in us.

1467
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:47,186
We're a little lost here, but now we're going to be...

1468
00:59:47,187 --> 00:59:48,486
all the way back up again.

1469
00:59:48,487 --> 00:59:52,787
And all of the other teams should be very nervous for the next mission.

1470
00:59:52,957 --> 00:59:55,287
Because I bet you AG SQUAD is going to take it out.

1471
00:59:55,487 --> 00:59:57,796
As soon as you hear the song, you think...

1472
00:59:57,797 --> 00:59:59,426
(Shake it)

1473
00:59:59,427 --> 01:00:01,396
AG SQUAD had it back.

1474
01:00:01,397 --> 01:00:03,626
This is very feminine.

1475
01:00:03,627 --> 01:00:05,096
This is our forte.

1476
01:00:05,097 --> 01:00:07,706
We feel like we can kill this.

1477
01:00:07,707 --> 01:00:10,337
Saweetie is a high-level artist,

1478
01:00:10,537 --> 01:00:13,236
who is global and worldwide-known.

1479
01:00:13,237 --> 01:00:16,607
We need to come up with something different, though.

1480
01:00:16,707 --> 01:00:18,816
Something catchy that's memorable.

1481
01:00:18,817 --> 01:00:19,977
What Saweetie is.

1482
01:00:20,787 --> 01:00:22,417
What could just fit Saweetie?

1483
01:00:23,857 --> 01:00:25,617
Think of some type of concept.

1484
01:00:26,017 --> 01:00:28,586
Shake it.

1485
01:00:28,587 --> 01:00:31,226
We're mostly just trying to figure out...

1486
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:34,927
what we're going to do that's going to be impressive and new.

1487
01:00:35,367 --> 01:00:39,637
We did our research on Saweetie. What she likes. What her vibe is.

1488
01:00:39,737 --> 01:00:41,406
Saweetie is very sexy.

1489
01:00:41,407 --> 01:00:42,607
We want to do something tight.

1490
01:00:43,037 --> 01:00:44,736
That would go nicely.

1491
01:00:44,737 --> 01:00:47,106
- It'd be great for the branding. - Yes.

1492
01:00:47,107 --> 01:00:48,647
- Sexy red. - Sexy red.

1493
01:00:49,407 --> 01:00:51,677
Something she would wear, and then we'd complement.

1494
01:00:51,777 --> 01:00:53,917
- Yes. - I think fur. Fur is like...

1495
01:00:54,447 --> 01:00:56,117
- That's different. - Nice.

1496
01:00:56,217 --> 01:00:58,116
And the material is great to shake.

1497
01:00:58,117 --> 01:00:59,186
- Yes. - Yes.

1498
01:00:59,187 --> 01:01:02,356
Saweetie is wearing the fur like a matching skirt and top.

1499
01:01:02,357 --> 01:01:04,396
That looks sexy and strong.

1500
01:01:04,397 --> 01:01:07,996
And then we thought how can we complement her.

1501
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:11,597
And we saw for every single live performance she has done.

1502
01:01:11,697 --> 01:01:13,837
She only uses a handheld mic.

1503
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:15,867
She likes to use a handheld one.

1504
01:01:16,667 --> 01:01:21,776
So we have made a customized fur microphone.

1505
01:01:21,777 --> 01:01:22,876
It is a one-of-a-kind.

1506
01:01:22,877 --> 01:01:25,676
It's really cool. This will really tie in our outfits.

1507
01:01:25,677 --> 01:01:27,447
And Saweetie will like it.

1508
01:01:27,547 --> 01:01:29,446
- Shake it. - Shake it.

1509
01:01:29,447 --> 01:01:31,616
We asked ourselves, really thinking about it...

1510
01:01:31,617 --> 01:01:33,816
when we were listening to the song.

1511
01:01:33,817 --> 01:01:35,487
That Aaliyah...

1512
01:01:36,287 --> 01:01:38,427
Will you be Saweetie, girl?

1513
01:01:38,927 --> 01:01:39,927
Period.

1514
01:01:40,867 --> 01:01:44,536
I know Aaliyah will just devour it.

1515
01:01:44,537 --> 01:01:46,966
She's very confident when she moves...

1516
01:01:46,967 --> 01:01:50,307
and very strong in her femininity.

1517
01:01:50,407 --> 01:01:51,606
She's very sexy.

1518
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:53,376
She's good with her hips.

1519
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:57,216
She is Saweetie to a T. And I felt like...

1520
01:01:57,217 --> 01:01:58,817
this time it was her time.

1521
01:01:59,177 --> 01:02:01,046
- And this is your stage. - Thank you.

1522
01:02:01,047 --> 01:02:03,486
You'll absolutely kill it.

1523
01:02:03,487 --> 01:02:04,557
- You know. - Please.

1524
01:02:06,487 --> 01:02:08,786
You know, I'm just grateful that Kaea chose me.

1525
01:02:08,787 --> 01:02:10,357
Saweetie.

1526
01:02:10,757 --> 01:02:14,267
I want to execute this task to my best ability.

1527
01:02:14,467 --> 01:02:15,897
I'm a bother sipping

1528
01:02:16,797 --> 01:02:19,637
I was very determined to get these lyrics right.

1529
01:02:20,197 --> 01:02:22,007
(My gosh)

1530
01:02:22,407 --> 01:02:23,976
- Go again. - Lip sync it.

1531
01:02:23,977 --> 01:02:25,837
I think this is going to help me, no?

1532
01:02:25,937 --> 01:02:28,906
So I'm like I want to be like Saweetie.

1533
01:02:28,907 --> 01:02:30,477
And then we should go crazy.

1534
01:02:30,577 --> 01:02:32,347
- My heels. - No, this is Kaea's...

1535
01:02:32,547 --> 01:02:33,616
I'm getting my heels off.

1536
01:02:33,617 --> 01:02:35,787
And I can also act as an artist as well.

1537
01:02:36,947 --> 01:02:38,816
Like all rappers... You know what I mean?

1538
01:02:38,817 --> 01:02:40,256
Like when rappers just like...

1539
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:41,356
(Taking off her heels)

1540
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:42,357
(Tossing)

1541
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:43,856
- I reckon you should take them off. - That's smart.

1542
01:02:43,857 --> 01:02:45,857
And then just walk right up and then just drop it.

1543
01:02:46,497 --> 01:02:49,896
I thought, "Yes, go off!"

1544
01:02:49,897 --> 01:02:52,267
It just makes it more raw and real.

1545
01:02:52,367 --> 01:02:54,036
- Okay. Let's do it. - Yes.

1546
01:02:54,037 --> 01:02:58,277
We were creating this piece of what Saweetie would like...

1547
01:02:58,607 --> 01:03:01,377
and what AG SQUAD does best, so...

1548
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:03,176
It's like merging the two together.

1549
01:03:03,177 --> 01:03:04,846
In front of it, and she's just like this.

1550
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:05,887
- Shake it. - She could...

1551
01:03:06,677 --> 01:03:08,116
(I like this.)

1552
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,217
It's like impact.

1553
01:03:09,517 --> 01:03:10,546
- Nice. - Shake it.

1554
01:03:10,547 --> 01:03:12,417
And she always does this.

1555
01:03:15,127 --> 01:03:16,387
And that's you.

1556
01:03:16,957 --> 01:03:18,197
(Perfect)

1557
01:03:18,297 --> 01:03:19,456
(Aalweetie is the best.)

1558
01:03:19,457 --> 01:03:20,457
Period.

1559
01:03:20,458 --> 01:03:22,466
She might be like, "That would be so cool if I did that."

1560
01:03:22,467 --> 01:03:23,467
- Yes. - Yes.

1561
01:03:23,468 --> 01:03:25,766
She loves to do hip movements.

1562
01:03:25,767 --> 01:03:28,837
We need to incorporate some booty movements.

1563
01:03:28,937 --> 01:03:30,707
Energy.

1564
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:34,046
But we also want to showcase dance as well...

1565
01:03:34,047 --> 01:03:36,577
and do something that no one's going to expect.

1566
01:03:36,947 --> 01:03:39,277
(Eccentric version of "Shake it")

1567
01:03:39,677 --> 01:03:41,817
(Another eccentric version of "Shake it")

1568
01:03:42,787 --> 01:03:43,787
(Chuckling)

1569
01:03:43,788 --> 01:03:46,886
- That's a pretty hard move. - Hard move.

1570
01:03:46,887 --> 01:03:48,457
- We can get it. - Yes, you guys go.

1571
01:03:48,927 --> 01:03:52,256
We are feeling very determined and hungry to win this mission.

1572
01:03:52,257 --> 01:03:56,267
I'm definitely keen to match up on stage.

1573
01:03:56,367 --> 01:03:57,867
AG SQUAD

1574
01:03:58,367 --> 01:03:59,367
Period!

1575
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:00,466
(How will AG SQUAD's performance turn out?)

1576
01:04:00,467 --> 01:04:02,837
We're confident that she will pick us.

1577
01:04:03,337 --> 01:04:06,536
Why don't we guess who's doing Saweetie?

1578
01:04:06,537 --> 01:04:07,983
I'm very sure it's going to be Aaliyah.

1579
01:04:08,007 --> 01:04:09,106
(Aaliyah chosen for the 2nd time)

1580
01:04:09,107 --> 01:04:10,877
She's good at facial expressions.

1581
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:13,487
I think they're going to have the most like...

1582
01:04:13,777 --> 01:04:15,147
- Facials. - Yes.

1583
01:04:15,287 --> 01:04:16,346
- I love it. - Whip

1584
01:04:16,347 --> 01:04:18,156
(Mimicking Aaliyah's facial expression)

1585
01:04:18,157 --> 01:04:20,386
To be honest, aren't they our biggest threat?

1586
01:04:20,387 --> 01:04:22,126
AG SQUAD is the biggest threat.

1587
01:04:22,127 --> 01:04:23,556
- They've worked with... - They're the strongest.

1588
01:04:23,557 --> 01:04:24,796
Jennifer Lopez.

1589
01:04:24,797 --> 01:04:27,197
I'm expecting my jaw falls on the floor for AG SQUAD.

1590
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:28,426
Like gagged?

1591
01:04:28,427 --> 01:04:29,596
(Like this)

1592
01:04:29,597 --> 01:04:32,067
I hope they're too tired, and they don't gag me.

1593
01:04:33,137 --> 01:04:35,167
- Okay. - Okay, AG SQUAD.

1594
01:04:36,337 --> 01:04:38,107
It's a little mysterious.

1595
01:04:38,307 --> 01:04:41,147
I'd love to see what they're bringing.

1596
01:04:41,707 --> 01:04:43,177
Can we please watch?

1597
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:46,377
- They're still in. - Yes.

1598
01:04:46,477 --> 01:04:47,746
(Excited to the maximum)

1599
01:04:47,747 --> 01:04:49,247
Let me see.

1600
01:04:58,257 --> 01:04:59,326
There is no movement.

1601
01:04:59,327 --> 01:05:00,596
("Shake It Fast" by Saweetie, Choreography by AG SQUAD)

1602
01:05:00,597 --> 01:05:01,627
Aaliyah.

1603
01:05:02,027 --> 01:05:03,796
It's Aaliyah!

1604
01:05:03,797 --> 01:05:05,136
(Surprised)

1605
01:05:05,137 --> 01:05:07,667
- I'm excited to see Aaliyah. - Yes.

1606
01:05:09,367 --> 01:05:10,837
Nice.

1607
01:05:12,177 --> 01:05:13,617
She's using the handheld microphone.

1608
01:05:13,677 --> 01:05:15,523
The microphone makes her look more like a singer.

1609
01:05:15,547 --> 01:05:17,206
That's a good idea, too.

1610
01:05:17,207 --> 01:05:20,376
They're great.

1611
01:05:20,377 --> 01:05:22,147
It looks like Aaliyah is really singing.

1612
01:05:22,247 --> 01:05:24,617
- Oh my gosh. - My gosh.

1613
01:05:25,417 --> 01:05:26,487
Aaliyah is crazy.

1614
01:05:26,757 --> 01:05:27,787
They look good.

1615
01:05:32,127 --> 01:05:33,697
(Unimaginable hip drums)

1616
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:35,697
(Making her stand up)

1617
01:05:35,997 --> 01:05:37,326
She did it.

1618
01:05:37,327 --> 01:05:38,497
Yes, she did it.

1619
01:05:39,837 --> 01:05:40,867
That's amazing.

1620
01:05:45,337 --> 01:05:46,806
They're really great.

1621
01:05:46,807 --> 01:05:48,577
I like it.

1622
01:05:48,777 --> 01:05:50,917
Oh, my gosh.

1623
01:05:54,287 --> 01:05:55,447
Let's go.

1624
01:05:55,887 --> 01:05:58,357
(Shake it, squad!)

1625
01:05:59,787 --> 01:06:01,087
They did it so well.

1626
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:02,957
I love the "Shake it."

1627
01:06:06,197 --> 01:06:07,227
My gosh!

1628
01:06:15,807 --> 01:06:16,807
I love that.

1629
01:06:17,977 --> 01:06:20,236
Their facial expressions are amazing.

1630
01:06:20,237 --> 01:06:22,447
This is crazy.

1631
01:06:24,047 --> 01:06:25,346
Oh, my gosh.

1632
01:06:25,347 --> 01:06:27,217
I like it.

1633
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,317
- I like it. It's clean. - Yes.

1634
01:06:33,817 --> 01:06:35,157
What crazy expressions.

1635
01:06:35,287 --> 01:06:37,497
- Oh, my gosh. - It's crazy.

1636
01:06:37,597 --> 01:06:38,957
I love that.

1637
01:06:40,597 --> 01:06:41,767
She was good.

1638
01:06:42,127 --> 01:06:44,666
- It's like Aaliyah's debut stage. - Exactly.

1639
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,437
She's so beautiful.

1640
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:50,807
This part made the artist stand out.

1641
01:06:52,307 --> 01:06:55,147
AG SQUAD knows how to control their power.

1642
01:06:59,447 --> 01:07:01,017
They look amazing.

1643
01:07:01,787 --> 01:07:02,987
- I like this. - Shake it.

1644
01:07:09,557 --> 01:07:10,827
They use the whole stage.

1645
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:12,757
Hey.

1646
01:07:13,657 --> 01:07:17,027
- She took off her heels. - Why did she take them off?

1647
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:18,737
What's next?

1648
01:07:27,607 --> 01:07:29,507
(Falling for AG SQUAD)

1649
01:07:32,747 --> 01:07:34,247
She looks cool even standing still.

1650
01:07:34,947 --> 01:07:36,647
I found this part bold.

1651
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,517
Oh, no!

1652
01:07:39,087 --> 01:07:40,117
I got goosebumps.

1653
01:07:44,357 --> 01:07:45,656
(Global Artist Performance Song, "Shake It Fast" by Saweetie)

1654
01:07:45,657 --> 01:07:46,657
(Listen to it on Spotify.)

1655
01:07:46,658 --> 01:07:48,426
What have they done? That was amazing.

1656
01:07:48,427 --> 01:07:49,627
- So cute. - They are so good.

1657
01:07:51,097 --> 01:07:53,537
AG SQUAD!

1658
01:07:55,267 --> 01:07:57,067
- This is so good. - Let's go, baby.

1659
01:07:57,877 --> 01:07:58,977
They're so cool.

1660
01:07:59,477 --> 01:08:00,807
I want to watch it again.

1661
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:03,707
I think AG SQUAD...

1662
01:08:03,777 --> 01:08:06,676
went with the way that they could do best,

1663
01:08:06,677 --> 01:08:08,686
- and the way that suited them most. - Yes. That is what they do best.

1664
01:08:08,687 --> 01:08:09,786
- Yes. - You're right.

1665
01:08:09,787 --> 01:08:11,986
It was filled with the taste...

1666
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:14,186
- of the artist. - I think she is going to love it.

1667
01:08:14,187 --> 01:08:15,833
- It was like a pop star's stage. - Even I...

1668
01:08:15,857 --> 01:08:17,456
I think Saweetie will like it.

1669
01:08:17,457 --> 01:08:18,633
(Performance that fits the artist's taste)

1670
01:08:18,657 --> 01:08:20,126
It was like a live concert.

1671
01:08:20,127 --> 01:08:22,727
It's like they had the audience watching in their heads.

1672
01:08:23,367 --> 01:08:24,797
But...

1673
01:08:25,467 --> 01:08:29,367
Just overall, wasn't it cute?

1674
01:08:30,307 --> 01:08:31,987
Based on what AG SQUAD had shown so far...

1675
01:08:32,677 --> 01:08:35,047
I expected their performance to be more powerful.

1676
01:08:35,147 --> 01:08:36,667
It was different from what I expected.

1677
01:08:37,347 --> 01:08:39,227
They have so many visuals that stay in my head.

1678
01:08:39,317 --> 01:08:41,047
Yes, so good.

1679
01:08:41,147 --> 01:08:45,717
I feel like their "Shake it" choice was small, yet effective.

1680
01:08:46,117 --> 01:08:47,217
That was cute.

1681
01:08:47,317 --> 01:08:49,387
But it was kind of similar to BUMSUP.

1682
01:08:50,057 --> 01:08:51,556
They shook it, and we shook it.

1683
01:08:51,557 --> 01:08:52,557
Right.

1684
01:08:52,897 --> 01:08:55,096
If this was on a stage,

1685
01:08:55,097 --> 01:08:57,266
and Saweetie was actually doing it,

1686
01:08:57,267 --> 01:08:58,797
how much of what they...

1687
01:08:59,367 --> 01:09:02,166
How much of what Aaliyah was doing could she actually do?

1688
01:09:02,167 --> 01:09:04,837
Or she'd be like, "That's nice, but..."

1689
01:09:04,937 --> 01:09:07,977
"I wouldn't be able to do that. I'm not a dancer."

1690
01:09:08,447 --> 01:09:11,516
It definitely feels like AG SQUAD's approach to it.

1691
01:09:11,517 --> 01:09:13,347
Rather than trying to be...

1692
01:09:13,447 --> 01:09:15,217
what Saweetie would want to see.

1693
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:17,287
You guys. Did you guys just see that?

1694
01:09:17,387 --> 01:09:18,687
- Yes. - Fire.

1695
01:09:19,417 --> 01:09:21,886
- My wig almost blew off. - Yes.

1696
01:09:21,887 --> 01:09:23,956
That was very Saweetieish of them.

1697
01:09:23,957 --> 01:09:25,957
I love how they came out of the mist,

1698
01:09:26,397 --> 01:09:28,396
By the way, she moves her facial expressions...

1699
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:29,567
throughout the performance.

1700
01:09:29,767 --> 01:09:32,067
Everything was just so beautiful.

1701
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:34,436
I would go home and be like, "I want to do that."

1702
01:09:34,437 --> 01:09:37,137
I loved it when she was tripping at the clear port.

1703
01:09:37,237 --> 01:09:39,537
I love how she brought that lyrics to life.

1704
01:09:40,137 --> 01:09:41,977
Aaliyah just embodied you.

1705
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:43,976
(Impressed)

1706
01:09:43,977 --> 01:09:46,446
That's her song, isn't it? It's not.

1707
01:09:46,447 --> 01:09:49,687
It really gave it as if it was her doing it,

1708
01:09:49,987 --> 01:09:51,516
and I loved it.

1709
01:09:51,517 --> 01:09:53,616
- Other than that, they killed that. - Yes.

1710
01:09:53,617 --> 01:09:57,286
And like you said, the microphone made it seem so much better...

1711
01:09:57,287 --> 01:10:01,367
because it's a skill to be able to keep all of that moving...

1712
01:10:01,467 --> 01:10:03,426
while having a microphone in your hand.

1713
01:10:03,427 --> 01:10:05,697
So it also made everything so much better.

1714
01:10:05,797 --> 01:10:06,996
It felt effortless.

1715
01:10:06,997 --> 01:10:08,936
It didn't feel like they were trying to sell me something.

1716
01:10:08,937 --> 01:10:10,536
It looked like they were performing something...

1717
01:10:10,537 --> 01:10:11,736
that they loved to perform.

1718
01:10:11,737 --> 01:10:13,136
Yes. Right.

1719
01:10:13,137 --> 01:10:14,847
- It was like this. - What?

1720
01:10:14,947 --> 01:10:17,507
- Period. Thank you. - Thank you.

1721
01:10:17,877 --> 01:10:20,946
- Good job, everyone. - Good job.

1722
01:10:20,947 --> 01:10:23,016
- Good job, Saweetie girl. - Well done.

1723
01:10:23,017 --> 01:10:25,216
I was definitely the best Saweetie.

1724
01:10:25,217 --> 01:10:29,126
And I think AG SQUAD also delivered nothing but their best as well.

1725
01:10:29,127 --> 01:10:30,627
So it'll be me.

1726
01:10:31,957 --> 01:10:34,327
(What will be the result of Aaliyah as Saweetie?)

1727
01:10:34,527 --> 01:10:35,696
My last note is...

1728
01:10:35,697 --> 01:10:37,326
Those four great dance teams...

1729
01:10:37,327 --> 01:10:38,796
They felt like artists.

1730
01:10:38,797 --> 01:10:41,236
Something that I would want to be if I was watching it.

1731
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:42,267
Honestly,

1732
01:10:42,537 --> 01:10:45,306
I'm such a huge fan of Japanese culture,

1733
01:10:45,307 --> 01:10:47,006
especially their street fashion.

1734
01:10:47,007 --> 01:10:50,706
I look up to Japanese street-style for my own style, so...

1735
01:10:50,707 --> 01:10:52,917
I really loved how they put their styles together.

1736
01:10:53,217 --> 01:10:54,417
Kaidi, I'm really...

1737
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:58,086
I think their facial expressions were amazing and bomb.

1738
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:00,886
Their facial expressions and how they conveyed their emotions.

1739
01:11:00,887 --> 01:11:03,726
I think that was something that I really liked...

1740
01:11:03,727 --> 01:11:06,397
and could see myself perfecting.

1741
01:11:06,927 --> 01:11:08,096
I love Leejung.

1742
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,997
Her aura was just very piercing.

1743
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:13,436
And all the emotions that she embodied...

1744
01:11:13,437 --> 01:11:15,006
throughout the performance...

1745
01:11:15,007 --> 01:11:16,137
I love how she moves.

1746
01:11:16,437 --> 01:11:17,466
AG SQUAD.

1747
01:11:17,467 --> 01:11:20,536
I loved how they utilized the space with their formations.

1748
01:11:20,537 --> 01:11:22,146
They came in. They came out.

1749
01:11:22,147 --> 01:11:24,746
They raised the bar with how they presented everything.

1750
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:27,017
At my next show, I need some mist.

1751
01:11:27,377 --> 01:11:30,317
(She loved the smog.)

1752
01:11:30,747 --> 01:11:32,416
The best thing and the greatest thing...

1753
01:11:32,417 --> 01:11:34,927
that you can do on that stage is inspire.

1754
01:11:35,157 --> 01:11:38,296
As an artist myself, I'm inspired to go to rehearsals.

1755
01:11:38,297 --> 01:11:40,496
I'm inspired to dance better...

1756
01:11:40,497 --> 01:11:42,866
and to go and do better for my own artistry.

1757
01:11:42,867 --> 01:11:43,867
Okay.

1758
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:47,536
The crew that captured my vibe, my essence,

1759
01:11:47,537 --> 01:11:50,566
my universe, my stage energy the best...

1760
01:11:50,567 --> 01:11:54,546
This crew is going to perform my brand-new track for this mission.

1761
01:11:54,547 --> 01:11:55,847
And this crew...

1762
01:11:57,347 --> 01:11:59,246
is...

1763
01:11:59,247 --> 01:12:00,476
Shoutout to the girls.

1764
01:12:00,477 --> 01:12:03,747
I loved the style, energy, hair...

1765
01:12:04,317 --> 01:12:06,556
Which crew will get chosen by Saweetie...

1766
01:12:06,557 --> 01:12:09,626
and receive the bonus points of 100 points?

1767
01:12:09,627 --> 01:12:10,926
We can definitely win those points.

1768
01:12:10,927 --> 01:12:12,996
I'm about 200 percent sure.

1769
01:12:12,997 --> 01:12:15,026
This crew is...

1770
01:12:15,027 --> 01:12:16,326
I was not expecting that.

1771
01:12:16,327 --> 01:12:17,466
(The second mission of the semi-final round)

1772
01:12:17,467 --> 01:12:19,296
As for the result of the Global Public Evaluation...

1773
01:12:19,297 --> 01:12:20,466
This is where things get important.

1774
01:12:20,467 --> 01:12:22,666
This main section should be ours.

1775
01:12:22,667 --> 01:12:24,466
That crew is so formidable.

1776
01:12:24,467 --> 01:12:26,776
I feel like people are starting to love MOTIV.

1777
01:12:26,777 --> 01:12:27,876
MOTIV is unexpected.

1778
01:12:27,877 --> 01:12:29,006
Maybe BUMSUP.

1779
01:12:29,007 --> 01:12:30,476
Kyoka was at the center.

1780
01:12:30,477 --> 01:12:33,376
OSAKA Ojo Gang will definitely get the main section.

1781
01:12:33,377 --> 01:12:35,046
The public evaluation always makes me nervous.

1782
01:12:35,047 --> 01:12:36,887
The crew that will take the main section is...

1783
01:12:37,417 --> 01:12:39,116
Was there such a big difference in the numbers of likes?

1784
01:12:39,117 --> 01:12:41,086
Things became interesting.

1785
01:12:41,087 --> 01:12:45,296
(Global Artist Performance Mission, Saweetie's Pick)

1786
01:12:45,297 --> 01:12:47,457
So, today is the day.

1787
01:12:47,967 --> 01:12:50,166
(Finally, Saweetie's bonus points and the public voting results...)

1788
01:12:50,167 --> 01:12:51,773
(will be revealed for the semi-final mission.)

1789
01:12:51,797 --> 01:12:54,706
The voting has ended for the Saweetie challenge.

1790
01:12:54,707 --> 01:12:55,767
How is everyone feeling?

1791
01:12:56,067 --> 01:12:58,076
- Were we the bottom two? - Yes.

1792
01:12:58,077 --> 01:12:59,537
- One of the bottom two. - Yes.

1793
01:13:01,647 --> 01:13:03,176
- Okay. - Okay. Yes.

1794
01:13:03,177 --> 01:13:04,177
- Good. - Yes.

1795
01:13:04,377 --> 01:13:05,516
Pretty good.

1796
01:13:05,517 --> 01:13:08,316
I think overall, we feel very confident because we know...

1797
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:11,186
that our one was the best for the Saweetie mission.

1798
01:13:11,187 --> 01:13:12,187
- Yes. - Yes.

1799
01:13:12,387 --> 01:13:14,526
- And we weren't far off. - Yes.

1800
01:13:14,527 --> 01:13:17,386
Honestly, the top three were pretty close.

1801
01:13:17,387 --> 01:13:19,596
So we could be okay in terms of likes.

1802
01:13:19,597 --> 01:13:21,497
We could overtake some of the others.

1803
01:13:21,727 --> 01:13:23,496
I don't think that'll happen.

1804
01:13:23,497 --> 01:13:26,836
To this song, we gave a unique, cute,

1805
01:13:26,837 --> 01:13:29,636
fun, and powerful performance.

1806
01:13:29,637 --> 01:13:31,537
Who else gave such a performance?

1807
01:13:31,637 --> 01:13:33,776
We were definitely different from the other crews.

1808
01:13:33,777 --> 01:13:35,776
- We were very different. - We were definitely different.

1809
01:13:35,777 --> 01:13:37,406
Which crew has the highest views?

1810
01:13:37,407 --> 01:13:39,076
We do. We have the highest views.

1811
01:13:39,077 --> 01:13:40,776
- Really? - Yes.

1812
01:13:40,777 --> 01:13:42,616
I think we can relax...

1813
01:13:42,617 --> 01:13:45,016
- Let's advance. - this time.

1814
01:13:45,017 --> 01:13:48,226
But we caught up slowly...

1815
01:13:48,227 --> 01:13:49,486
- in terms of views. - We did that little by little.

1816
01:13:49,487 --> 01:13:51,026
(OSAKA Ojo Gang is in 2nd place with the views that rose steadily.)

1817
01:13:51,027 --> 01:13:54,496
To be honest, I have a good feeling about this.

1818
01:13:54,497 --> 01:13:56,426
I feel like the flow of support...

1819
01:13:56,427 --> 01:13:58,337
is with us right now.

1820
01:13:59,097 --> 01:14:00,496
I can say this with certainty.

1821
01:14:00,497 --> 01:14:02,267
We won't go to the Elimination Battle.

1822
01:14:02,867 --> 01:14:03,967
We're relaxed.

1823
01:14:04,637 --> 01:14:06,677
(OSAKA Ojo Gang is confident about this mission.)

1824
01:14:07,007 --> 01:14:08,477
As for MOTIV,

1825
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:11,037
I think they'll be okay since they're good at battles.

1826
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:12,447
Right.

1827
01:14:13,077 --> 01:14:15,346
Don't say, "Right." You don't know if they'll go to battle.

1828
01:14:15,347 --> 01:14:17,046
It hasn't been decided,

1829
01:14:17,047 --> 01:14:20,086
but they have the lowest number of views.

1830
01:14:20,087 --> 01:14:21,587
It's always like that.

1831
01:14:22,087 --> 01:14:23,756
(The crew that's predicted to go to the Elimination Battle is...)

1832
01:14:23,757 --> 01:14:25,457
(MOTIV, the 4th place in views.)

1833
01:14:25,757 --> 01:14:26,927
Our views are low.

1834
01:14:27,257 --> 01:14:28,267
(Bitter laughter)

1835
01:14:28,467 --> 01:14:30,396
I mean, I feel like...

1836
01:14:30,397 --> 01:14:32,896
Yes. I'm just not surprised that our views are low.

1837
01:14:32,897 --> 01:14:34,137
They're always low.

1838
01:14:34,767 --> 01:14:36,436
(The funny and painful reality that they can't deny)

1839
01:14:36,437 --> 01:14:39,036
We know that MOTIV got the least amount of views.

1840
01:14:39,037 --> 01:14:41,136
But we don't know yet what's going to happen...

1841
01:14:41,137 --> 01:14:43,907
because we have a chance to get picked by Saweetie.

1842
01:14:44,717 --> 01:14:48,317
I'm curious about who Saweetie picked.

1843
01:14:48,617 --> 01:14:50,416
Wouldn't she have picked Minami?

1844
01:14:50,417 --> 01:14:52,986
I would've picked her.

1845
01:14:52,987 --> 01:14:54,116
That performance was never seen before.

1846
01:14:54,117 --> 01:14:56,233
She'll make that decision if she wants something new.

1847
01:14:56,257 --> 01:14:57,327
OSAKA Ojo Gang?

1848
01:14:58,297 --> 01:15:00,556
Oh, no.

1849
01:15:00,557 --> 01:15:02,467
They were shaking dumbbells. I don't know.

1850
01:15:03,497 --> 01:15:06,036
The only team from America...

1851
01:15:06,037 --> 01:15:07,696
and Saweetie being from America.

1852
01:15:07,697 --> 01:15:09,666
As the only team representing hip-hop,

1853
01:15:09,667 --> 01:15:11,576
it definitely benefits us.

1854
01:15:11,577 --> 01:15:12,906
No, it'll be us.

1855
01:15:12,907 --> 01:15:16,447
MOTIV's performance was like bland food.

1856
01:15:17,247 --> 01:15:19,977
But the key point of BUMSUP was...

1857
01:15:20,077 --> 01:15:23,986
Our performance was lovely and fun.

1858
01:15:23,987 --> 01:15:26,456
It was full of cheerful energy...

1859
01:15:26,457 --> 01:15:28,056
while being hip as well.

1860
01:15:28,057 --> 01:15:31,187
I think there's a big chance.

1861
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:33,327
That was not Saweetie.

1862
01:15:34,097 --> 01:15:35,577
- It just sweet. - It was just Korea.

1863
01:15:36,127 --> 01:15:39,766
This is our time to take out this competition.

1864
01:15:39,767 --> 01:15:43,506
I feel like Saweetie will favor our routine...

1865
01:15:43,507 --> 01:15:45,237
because it's her.

1866
01:15:45,577 --> 01:15:47,236
I'm sure Saweetie will like it.

1867
01:15:47,237 --> 01:15:48,246
- Yes. - Yes.

1868
01:15:48,247 --> 01:15:50,407
We'll see what she likes.

1869
01:15:50,607 --> 01:15:55,117
(Which crew will get chosen by Saweetie?)

1870
01:16:09,567 --> 01:16:11,566
(For the advancement to the final round, )

1871
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,287
(they'll have the last Elimination Battle.)

1872
01:16:13,437 --> 01:16:17,436
(Elimination Battle)

1873
01:16:17,437 --> 01:16:20,106
We're here to win, so losing is not an option.

1874
01:16:20,107 --> 01:16:21,177
Bring it!

1875
01:16:21,447 --> 01:16:25,146
We'll do our best to win.

1876
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:28,086
I'm someone who's full of passion.

1877
01:16:28,087 --> 01:16:29,586
(I want victory no matter what.)

1878
01:16:29,587 --> 01:16:30,686
It's important to be first.

1879
01:16:30,687 --> 01:16:32,887
We'll be the first at the end of the show.

1880
01:16:33,757 --> 01:16:37,386
Which crew will end up stopping here...

1881
01:16:37,387 --> 01:16:38,997
right before the final round?

1882
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:50,236
Let's step on the stage.

1883
01:16:50,237 --> 01:16:51,777
Okay. Let's step on the stage.

1884
01:16:53,537 --> 01:16:55,177
- Follow the white part. - Hello.

1885
01:16:55,377 --> 01:16:56,876
(Nervous)

1886
01:16:56,877 --> 01:16:58,616
- It's so close. - Should we all go up?

1887
01:16:58,617 --> 01:17:01,586
- It's so close. - BUMSUP.

1888
01:17:01,587 --> 01:17:03,316
I don't like it when it's squeaky.

1889
01:17:03,317 --> 01:17:05,286
(BUMSUP members check the floor right away.)

1890
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:07,286
Isn't it squeakier than you expected?

1891
01:17:07,287 --> 01:17:10,287
- I know. Is it because of the shoe? - It's squeaker than I expected.

1892
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:12,726
I think the stage is smaller than I expected.

1893
01:17:12,727 --> 01:17:15,797
Also, we'll need to be careful since there are no fences.

1894
01:17:16,197 --> 01:17:18,536
We couldn't predict the results this time.

1895
01:17:18,537 --> 01:17:20,836
So we thought, "We might really go to battle."

1896
01:17:20,837 --> 01:17:22,367
We need to win no matter what.

1897
01:17:22,807 --> 01:17:23,907
Let's go, girls.

1898
01:17:24,037 --> 01:17:25,207
(Turning)

1899
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:27,107
- Oh, no. It's so small. - Yes.

1900
01:17:27,937 --> 01:17:29,076
They're wearing extensions.

1901
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:31,106
I know. Their hairstyles changed.

1902
01:17:31,107 --> 01:17:32,976
It's quite big.

1903
01:17:32,977 --> 01:17:34,846
All right.

1904
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:38,286
Now, it's our time to get just all or nothing.

1905
01:17:38,287 --> 01:17:39,656
We need to make it to the finals.

1906
01:17:39,657 --> 01:17:44,626
It's going to be a challenge. It will be hard, but...

1907
01:17:44,627 --> 01:17:46,096
we'll be at the finals.

1908
01:17:46,097 --> 01:17:47,957
We do not want to go home.

1909
01:17:49,327 --> 01:17:50,926
(The next crew enters.)

1910
01:17:50,927 --> 01:17:52,936
- Hi. - Hi.

1911
01:17:52,937 --> 01:17:54,236
- Hi. - Good morning.

1912
01:17:54,237 --> 01:17:57,266
- Hey. - Good morning.

1913
01:17:57,267 --> 01:17:58,736
Hello.

1914
01:17:58,737 --> 01:18:00,536
- Hello. - What's up?

1915
01:18:00,537 --> 01:18:02,077
It isn't a good morning.

1916
01:18:02,147 --> 01:18:03,747
(Staring)

1917
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:06,647
No hellos.

1918
01:18:08,147 --> 01:18:09,916
I just got a surge of energy.

1919
01:18:09,917 --> 01:18:11,686
If we are at the bottom...

1920
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:14,486
and we do have to do the Elimination Battle,

1921
01:18:14,487 --> 01:18:17,356
I feel confident that we can knock out any team...

1922
01:18:17,357 --> 01:18:18,897
even if it's OSAKA Ojo Gang.

1923
01:18:19,197 --> 01:18:20,197
Easy.

1924
01:18:21,127 --> 01:18:23,267
(Lastly, OSAKA Ojo Gang enters.)

1925
01:18:23,867 --> 01:18:24,867
We're here.

1926
01:18:24,868 --> 01:18:26,966
This is crazy. The number of crews is small now.

1927
01:18:26,967 --> 01:18:28,206
(What?)

1928
01:18:28,207 --> 01:18:29,537
(What's this?)

1929
01:18:29,737 --> 01:18:31,807
It's completely different from the last time.

1930
01:18:32,807 --> 01:18:34,367
The design is similar to the last time.

1931
01:18:34,907 --> 01:18:36,247
- Who's missing? - Who's missing?

1932
01:18:36,547 --> 01:18:38,007
So where is Kyoka?

1933
01:18:39,477 --> 01:18:42,847
(Ibuki checks the stage first.)

1934
01:18:43,517 --> 01:18:44,746
If we think about the battle,

1935
01:18:44,747 --> 01:18:46,686
the distance is quite short this time.

1936
01:18:46,687 --> 01:18:48,886
- It's like this close. - It'll liven up the atmosphere.

1937
01:18:48,887 --> 01:18:49,926
Definitely.

1938
01:18:49,927 --> 01:18:51,726
Even without Kyoka,

1939
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:53,826
we'll be able to beat any team.

1940
01:18:53,827 --> 01:18:56,027
I'm very confident when it comes to battle.

1941
01:18:57,497 --> 01:18:58,897
Look at them practicing.

1942
01:18:59,337 --> 01:19:01,497
(Then I'll practice as well.)

1943
01:19:01,607 --> 01:19:03,607
Everyone is preparing for the Elimination Battle.

1944
01:19:04,507 --> 01:19:05,736
We don't know which crew it'll be.

1945
01:19:05,737 --> 01:19:09,006
Today, I can't predict anything.

1946
01:19:09,007 --> 01:19:11,817
The difference in the views isn't overwhelming.

1947
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:15,087
(All 4 crews entered the fight zone.)

1948
01:19:15,247 --> 01:19:16,247
Hello.

1949
01:19:16,248 --> 01:19:19,057
I'm Sung Han Bin, the MC of World of Street Woman Fighter.

1950
01:19:19,157 --> 01:19:20,816
Hello.

1951
01:19:20,817 --> 01:19:22,226
(Cheers...)

1952
01:19:22,227 --> 01:19:23,426
(and applause)

1953
01:19:23,427 --> 01:19:27,096
The cutthroat survival show to be the global number one dance crew,

1954
01:19:27,097 --> 01:19:28,926
World of Street Woman Fighter...

1955
01:19:28,927 --> 01:19:31,497
is reaching its end.

1956
01:19:31,897 --> 01:19:35,166
In this season, you went through No Respect World Battle,

1957
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:38,237
Class Mission, World of K-pop Mission,

1958
01:19:38,507 --> 01:19:40,406
and Mega Crew Mission.

1959
01:19:40,407 --> 01:19:43,647
Now, only four crews remain.

1960
01:19:44,207 --> 01:19:46,277
Having ROYAL FAMILY here feels like past life.

1961
01:19:46,317 --> 01:19:47,957
- It seems like forever ago. - Seriously.

1962
01:19:48,587 --> 01:19:49,647
It seems like forever ago.

1963
01:19:50,287 --> 01:19:52,056
What remains is only one thing.

1964
01:19:52,057 --> 01:19:53,956
It's the last stage that'll wrap up...

1965
01:19:53,957 --> 01:19:55,997
the grand journey of World of Street Woman Fighter,

1966
01:19:56,727 --> 01:19:58,927
the live finals.

1967
01:19:59,857 --> 01:20:02,997
And today, the last crew that'll get eliminated...

1968
01:20:03,167 --> 01:20:06,597
and thus won't participate in the finals will be decided.

1969
01:20:07,667 --> 01:20:09,866
To some, this will be...

1970
01:20:09,867 --> 01:20:13,037
the last stage on World of Street Woman Fighter.

1971
01:20:13,437 --> 01:20:15,377
That's annoying to hear.

1972
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:16,906
The semi-final round...

1973
01:20:16,907 --> 01:20:19,546
included the Global Artist Performance Mission...

1974
01:20:19,547 --> 01:20:20,916
and the Dance Film Mission.

1975
01:20:20,917 --> 01:20:23,686
They consisted of these two missions,

1976
01:20:23,687 --> 01:20:26,557
In the Global Artist Performance Mission,

1977
01:20:27,087 --> 01:20:31,026
the one crew that gets chosen by Saweetie...

1978
01:20:31,027 --> 01:20:33,227
will receive 100 bonus points.

1979
01:20:33,697 --> 01:20:36,726
And as per the results of the Global Public Evaluation,

1980
01:20:36,727 --> 01:20:39,097
the 1st place will receive 1,000 points.

1981
01:20:39,267 --> 01:20:41,966
From the 2nd place and down, 100 points will be subtracted...

1982
01:20:41,967 --> 01:20:43,266
per place.

1983
01:20:43,267 --> 01:20:45,207
(Global Artist Performance Mission)

1984
01:20:45,307 --> 01:20:47,237
We had the highest views, right?

1985
01:20:47,337 --> 01:20:49,746
I think we'll get around 800 points.

1986
01:20:49,747 --> 01:20:51,677
If we get very lucky, we'll get 900 points.

1987
01:20:52,217 --> 01:20:54,416
For the Dance Film Mission,

1988
01:20:54,417 --> 01:20:55,886
the fight judges...

1989
01:20:55,887 --> 01:20:58,247
will decide on the best dance crew.

1990
01:20:58,357 --> 01:21:02,157
The chosen crew will receive 100 bonus points.

1991
01:21:03,027 --> 01:21:04,467
It just gives the crew bonus points.

1992
01:21:05,227 --> 01:21:08,296
The final score will be the combination...

1993
01:21:08,297 --> 01:21:10,626
of the bonus points and Global Public Evaluation points...

1994
01:21:10,627 --> 01:21:11,897
from the two missions.

1995
01:21:12,297 --> 01:21:14,266
The combined points...

1996
01:21:14,267 --> 01:21:16,567
will determine the final rankings.

1997
01:21:16,637 --> 01:21:18,606
- We never know. - Right.

1998
01:21:18,607 --> 01:21:20,327
- You're right. - I can't predict anything.

1999
01:21:20,737 --> 01:21:24,006
And the two bottom crews on the final rankings will have...

2000
01:21:24,007 --> 01:21:27,917
the last Elimination Battle before the finals.

2001
01:21:28,847 --> 01:21:33,857
Which crews will have the last battle for the finals?

2002
01:21:36,887 --> 01:21:39,397
I'm going crazy because I don't have a clue.

2003
01:21:41,527 --> 01:21:42,597
Firstly,

2004
01:21:42,727 --> 01:21:45,436
I'll reveal the crew...

2005
01:21:45,437 --> 01:21:47,967
that got chosen by Saweetie...

2006
01:21:48,067 --> 01:21:51,707
and thus will receive 100 bonus points.

2007
01:21:54,177 --> 01:21:55,746
(In AG SQUAD, Aaliyah played Saweetie.)

2008
01:21:55,747 --> 01:21:57,746
(In MOTIV, Kaidi played Saweetie.)

2009
01:21:57,747 --> 01:21:59,376
(In BUMSUP, Leejung played Saweetie.)

2010
01:21:59,377 --> 01:22:01,447
(In OSAKA Ojo Gang, Minami played Saweetie.)

2011
01:22:01,547 --> 01:22:03,747
It's crazy. I don't know what's going to happen.

2012
01:22:04,747 --> 01:22:05,957
This is stressful.

2013
01:22:06,987 --> 01:22:08,157
What will happen?

2014
01:22:08,927 --> 01:22:10,257
(Sighing)

2015
01:22:11,127 --> 01:22:12,456
This is making my blood run dry.

2016
01:22:12,457 --> 01:22:14,957
This moment is so stressful.

2017
01:22:17,267 --> 01:22:20,836
Aaliyah, you played Saweetie in AG SQUAD.

2018
01:22:20,837 --> 01:22:24,606
I definitely feel like she will...

2019
01:22:24,607 --> 01:22:28,706
resonate with and relate to how we performed.

2020
01:22:28,707 --> 01:22:29,907
Yes. Shake it.

2021
01:22:30,047 --> 01:22:31,816
(Our youngest member is the best.)

2022
01:22:31,817 --> 01:22:32,817
She's so good.

2023
01:22:32,818 --> 01:22:35,687
I'm about 200 percent sure.

2024
01:22:36,487 --> 01:22:38,457
(Wary)

2025
01:22:38,617 --> 01:22:41,416
I think because we did an amazing job...

2026
01:22:41,417 --> 01:22:44,457
I think I did an amazing job at embodying her.

2027
01:22:44,727 --> 01:22:46,127
(No way!)

2028
01:22:46,227 --> 01:22:47,896
As for us,

2029
01:22:47,897 --> 01:22:49,366
the way we expressed the chorus...

2030
01:22:49,367 --> 01:22:51,097
was different from that of the other crews.

2031
01:22:51,297 --> 01:22:52,467
(Gasping)

2032
01:22:52,837 --> 01:22:56,206
Saweetie wears grills,

2033
01:22:56,207 --> 01:22:59,177
so our key point involved showing the teeth.

2034
01:23:00,107 --> 01:23:02,807
(You have a way with words.)

2035
01:23:03,207 --> 01:23:04,476
(The key dance move)

2036
01:23:04,477 --> 01:23:06,146
Which crew...

2037
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:10,417
will get chosen by Saweetie and take 100 bonus points?

2038
01:23:10,617 --> 01:23:12,687
Kaidi!

2039
01:23:13,317 --> 01:23:14,587
It's going to be Leejung.

2040
01:23:15,527 --> 01:23:17,727
It'll be our Leejung. It'll be our youngest member.

2041
01:23:17,957 --> 01:23:20,657
Which Saweetie is going to be the Saweetie?

2042
01:23:22,327 --> 01:23:23,467
This one right here.

2043
01:23:23,867 --> 01:23:24,897
- Hopefully. - You bet.

2044
01:23:25,797 --> 01:23:26,997
You can do it.

2045
01:23:28,667 --> 01:23:31,636
Let's check it out through the video.

2046
01:23:31,637 --> 01:23:32,706
Oh, my gosh.

2047
01:23:32,707 --> 01:23:33,707
(For real?)

2048
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:34,836
I'm nervous.

2049
01:23:34,837 --> 01:23:37,576
(Which crew did Saweetie pick?)

2050
01:23:37,577 --> 01:23:39,546
(Drum roll)

2051
01:23:39,547 --> 01:23:40,617
(I'm nervous.)

2052
01:23:41,817 --> 01:23:42,817
- Period. - Oh, my gosh.

2053
01:23:42,818 --> 01:23:43,898
Will she tell us like this?

2054
01:23:44,317 --> 01:23:45,987
(What will be the result?)

2055
01:23:46,657 --> 01:23:47,657
Okay.

2056
01:23:47,658 --> 01:23:51,226
The crew that captured my vibe, my essence,

2057
01:23:51,227 --> 01:23:54,257
my universe, my stage energy the best.

2058
01:23:54,627 --> 01:23:57,427
I'm very confident in being selected by Saweetie.

2059
01:23:57,527 --> 01:23:59,736
I think we have a really good shot.

2060
01:23:59,737 --> 01:24:02,666
I think my choreography is very honest.

2061
01:24:02,667 --> 01:24:04,536
Wouldn't she like that a lot?

2062
01:24:04,537 --> 01:24:06,907
I was definitely the best Saweetie.

2063
01:24:06,977 --> 01:24:09,877
We will be the main characters.

2064
01:24:10,147 --> 01:24:12,046
I think I was second to none...

2065
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:14,246
when it came to showing Saweetie's charisma.

2066
01:24:14,247 --> 01:24:17,387
In terms of impact, am I not the winner?

2067
01:24:17,517 --> 01:24:18,817
Okay. This crew...

2068
01:24:19,017 --> 01:24:22,186
is going to perform my brand-new track for this mission.

2069
01:24:22,187 --> 01:24:23,426
(Expectant)

2070
01:24:23,427 --> 01:24:24,456
(Curious)

2071
01:24:24,457 --> 01:24:25,526
(Nervous)

2072
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:26,657
(Please)

2073
01:24:27,127 --> 01:24:28,796
And this crew is...

2074
01:24:28,797 --> 01:24:31,067
AG SQUAD!

2075
01:24:31,127 --> 01:24:33,897
(Saweetie's final choice, AG SQUAD)

2076
01:24:34,167 --> 01:24:36,036
(We did it.)

2077
01:24:36,037 --> 01:24:38,337
(Thank you for your hard work.)

2078
01:24:39,277 --> 01:24:40,507
They did well.

2079
01:24:41,137 --> 01:24:42,677
(They accept the result.)

2080
01:24:43,177 --> 01:24:44,647
(Chuckling)

2081
01:24:45,147 --> 01:24:46,517
Shoutout to Aaliyah.

2082
01:24:46,547 --> 01:24:47,917
Shoutout to the girls.

2083
01:24:48,587 --> 01:24:51,646
I just want to give a special shoutout,

2084
01:24:51,647 --> 01:24:53,416
a special message...

2085
01:24:53,417 --> 01:24:55,526
to AG SQUAD from Australia.

2086
01:24:55,527 --> 01:24:57,186
You guys definitely held it down.

2087
01:24:57,187 --> 01:24:58,927
I'm so impressed.

2088
01:24:59,027 --> 01:25:03,526
I want to go to my rehearsals and step my game up now.

2089
01:25:03,527 --> 01:25:05,096
You guys were so inspirational.

2090
01:25:05,097 --> 01:25:06,297
Everything was on point.

2091
01:25:06,737 --> 01:25:09,966
Oh, my gosh. It was so effortless. I'm so proud of you guys.

2092
01:25:09,967 --> 01:25:11,167
Keep working hard.

2093
01:25:11,367 --> 01:25:13,367
I'm excited to see where you guys are going to go.

2094
01:25:13,537 --> 01:25:15,407
I'm so proud. Congratulations.

2095
01:25:16,077 --> 01:25:18,546
Thank you. That's so nice.

2096
01:25:18,547 --> 01:25:20,716
I didn't think that we were going to win for a second.

2097
01:25:20,717 --> 01:25:21,746
Yes.

2098
01:25:21,747 --> 01:25:22,846
That's so nice.

2099
01:25:22,847 --> 01:25:24,546
When I think of dance competitions,

2100
01:25:24,547 --> 01:25:27,716
I think this is a great, safe space for these women to come together...

2101
01:25:27,717 --> 01:25:29,587
and express themselves creatively.

2102
01:25:29,887 --> 01:25:32,697
I'm satisfied and happy to be a part of this.

2103
01:25:32,827 --> 01:25:35,567
Most importantly, I'm inspired. So thank you for having me.

2104
01:25:36,997 --> 01:25:39,397
- Saweetie. - That's so nice.

2105
01:25:39,497 --> 01:25:41,197
(Moved)

2106
01:25:41,437 --> 01:25:44,266
The crew that received 100 bonus points is...

2107
01:25:44,267 --> 01:25:46,277
- A hundred! - AG SQUAD.

2108
01:25:46,937 --> 01:25:48,676
Saweetie, Leejung.

2109
01:25:48,677 --> 01:25:50,406
- You did well. - Saweetie, Leejung.

2110
01:25:50,407 --> 01:25:51,807
(Disappointed)

2111
01:25:52,347 --> 01:25:53,347
Sorry, Saweetie.

2112
01:25:53,747 --> 01:25:54,916
Don't apologize.

2113
01:25:54,917 --> 01:25:56,147
(Kaidi is cool.)

2114
01:25:56,187 --> 01:25:57,387
Let's go.

2115
01:25:59,257 --> 01:26:00,987
We're moving our way to the top.

2116
01:26:01,257 --> 01:26:03,527
I have faith that they'll believe in AG SQUAD...

2117
01:26:03,827 --> 01:26:05,927
and help us get to the finals.

2118
01:26:06,557 --> 01:26:08,866
Will AG SQUAD be able...

2119
01:26:08,867 --> 01:26:11,527
to continue on with this energy?

2120
01:26:11,727 --> 01:26:15,907
Now, let's check out the result of the Dance Film Mission.

2121
01:26:18,607 --> 01:26:20,406
- The shoot we just shot? - Yes.

2122
01:26:20,407 --> 01:26:21,437
What the...

2123
01:26:21,737 --> 01:26:23,077
(We're so nervous.)

2124
01:26:23,277 --> 01:26:24,707
What will the result be?

2125
01:26:25,747 --> 01:26:27,117
For the Dance Film Mission,

2126
01:26:27,677 --> 01:26:30,147
each crew divided up the sections of a song...

2127
01:26:30,247 --> 01:26:32,116
with the theme of a woman...

2128
01:26:32,117 --> 01:26:34,857
and created one dance film.

2129
01:26:35,657 --> 01:26:39,197
The song consisted of five sections.

2130
01:26:39,297 --> 01:26:43,167
Among them, the main section was the most impactful.

2131
01:26:43,497 --> 01:26:46,666
The crew that will take the main section...

2132
01:26:46,667 --> 01:26:49,137
will be chosen by the Global Public Evaluation.

2133
01:26:49,467 --> 01:26:50,706
The number of views...

2134
01:26:50,707 --> 01:26:54,376
and the number of likes multiplied by 100 will be combined.

2135
01:26:54,377 --> 01:26:57,206
The crew with the highest score...

2136
01:26:57,207 --> 01:26:59,476
will take the main section.

2137
01:26:59,477 --> 01:27:01,546
Taking this section increases...

2138
01:27:01,547 --> 01:27:06,057
their chance of getting selected as the best dance crew.

2139
01:27:06,487 --> 01:27:09,026
As per the results of the Global Public Evaluation,

2140
01:27:09,027 --> 01:27:11,557
which crew will take the main section?

2141
01:27:12,497 --> 01:27:14,827
Let's check out the crew...

2142
01:27:14,997 --> 01:27:17,166
that took the main section through Global Public Evaluation...

2143
01:27:17,167 --> 01:27:20,397
in the Dance Film Mission of the semi-final round.

2144
01:27:24,137 --> 01:27:26,276
Thank you for your hard work, everyone.

2145
01:27:26,277 --> 01:27:27,777
(Thank you for your hard work.)

2146
01:27:27,937 --> 01:27:29,546
The mission ended safely.

2147
01:27:29,547 --> 01:27:31,576
So that you'll be less tired tomorrow,

2148
01:27:31,577 --> 01:27:35,147
I'll make a smoothie to cure you of your fatigue.

2149
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:36,687
(Chef Kyoka is the best.)

2150
01:27:37,917 --> 01:27:39,717
- We're in your care. - Leave it to me.

2151
01:27:39,917 --> 01:27:41,356
Kyoka came prepared.

2152
01:27:41,357 --> 01:27:42,556
(Kyoka's pick! Blueberries, )

2153
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:43,686
(strawberries, )

2154
01:27:43,687 --> 01:27:45,157
(and mangoes)

2155
01:27:45,527 --> 01:27:46,997
(It's time to blend them!)

2156
01:27:47,227 --> 01:27:48,927
(Click!)

2157
01:27:49,527 --> 01:27:50,596
You just need to press it.

2158
01:27:50,597 --> 01:27:52,166
(It blends frozen fruits well.)

2159
01:27:52,167 --> 01:27:53,837
It's tiny but powerful.

2160
01:27:54,037 --> 01:27:55,606
(The smoothie gets made in no time.)

2161
01:27:55,607 --> 01:27:56,967
I'm excited. It looks so good.

2162
01:27:57,607 --> 01:28:00,606
- Cheers. - Cheers.

2163
01:28:00,607 --> 01:28:02,953
(OSAKA Ojo Gang gets their energy with an infallible combination.)

2164
01:28:02,977 --> 01:28:04,876
(Drinking)

2165
01:28:04,877 --> 01:28:06,276
(It's tasty.)

2166
01:28:06,277 --> 01:28:09,217
(They're very satisfied. It's a tasty smoothie.)

2167
01:28:09,517 --> 01:28:11,817
It's a size you can fit in your carry-on suitcase.

2168
01:28:12,217 --> 01:28:13,657
It isn't very heavy.

2169
01:28:14,117 --> 01:28:16,787
It'll be nice to carry it back to the hotel like this.

2170
01:28:16,987 --> 01:28:18,957
Since we recovered from fatigue,

2171
01:28:19,097 --> 01:28:21,497
let's keep up our spirits and do well with the next mission.

2172
01:28:21,657 --> 01:28:25,667
(1st place)

2173
01:28:26,197 --> 01:28:29,907
World of Street Woman Fighter, the Final OST Mission.

2174
01:28:30,607 --> 01:28:34,637
For the OST Mission, each crew will take and rearrange...

2175
01:28:34,937 --> 01:28:37,206
an OST of World of Street Woman Fighter...

2176
01:28:37,207 --> 01:28:39,217
and give a performance.

2177
01:28:39,877 --> 01:28:41,577
What's special about this mission...

2178
01:28:41,677 --> 01:28:45,287
is that the viewers will match a mission song to a crew.

2179
01:28:46,617 --> 01:28:48,517
On a global music subscription platform,

2180
01:28:48,617 --> 01:28:51,327
select the playlist of World of Street Woman Fighter...

2181
01:28:51,387 --> 01:28:52,697
and click, "Vote."

2182
01:28:53,127 --> 01:28:56,767
Match an OST that suits the crew you're rooting for.

2183
01:28:57,297 --> 01:28:59,296
The OST you selected...

2184
01:28:59,297 --> 01:29:01,137
will be used for the final stage.

2185
01:29:02,137 --> 01:29:04,236
Ready? Fight!

2186
01:29:04,237 --> 01:29:06,637
(Vote for the mission song of the crew you're rooting for.)

2187
01:29:08,137 --> 01:29:10,697
(The last step to the final round, the semi-final round begins.)

2188
01:29:11,747 --> 01:29:16,047
(The competition is fierce for the main section choreography.)

2189
01:29:16,417 --> 01:29:19,487
(Which crew will take the main section?)

2190
01:29:19,587 --> 01:29:21,416
(I think we can definitely get chosen by the fight judges.)

2191
01:29:21,417 --> 01:29:23,386
(I think breaking is so high-level.)

2192
01:29:23,387 --> 01:29:26,756
(No one else here can do what I'm doing, so...)

2193
01:29:26,757 --> 01:29:30,796
(I won't make my crew give up on anything.)

2194
01:29:30,797 --> 01:29:32,937
(And I feel like...)

2195
01:29:33,037 --> 01:29:34,396
(it's time for us to win.)

2196
01:29:34,397 --> 01:29:35,607
(No more losing.)

2197
01:29:35,707 --> 01:29:37,347
(I really want to advance to the finals.)

2198
01:29:38,937 --> 01:29:42,006
(I'll prove myself through dance, not 100 words.)

2199
01:29:42,007 --> 01:29:44,276
(The day of the shoot for the Dance Film Mission)

2200
01:29:44,277 --> 01:29:45,306
(BUMSUP's hidden section)

2201
01:29:45,307 --> 01:29:47,076
(While competing on World of Street Woman Fighter, )

2202
01:29:47,077 --> 01:29:49,016
(we helped each other.)

2203
01:29:49,017 --> 01:29:50,216
(Through this process, )

2204
01:29:50,217 --> 01:29:54,486
(all of us are winners.)

2205
01:29:54,487 --> 01:29:58,357
(BUMSUP's hidden section, I think I was the most impressed with.)

2206
01:29:58,457 --> 01:30:02,096
(I could see that they created something really beautiful.)

2207
01:30:02,097 --> 01:30:03,727
(That's a good idea.)

2208
01:30:03,827 --> 01:30:05,636
(They brought the last season's trophy.)

2209
01:30:05,637 --> 01:30:08,906
(That's different from creating something for the stage.)

2210
01:30:08,907 --> 01:30:12,607
(AG SQUAD. I think overall, it felt like a costume.)

2211
01:30:14,137 --> 01:30:16,307
(The silver gloves weren't impressive.)

2212
01:30:16,707 --> 01:30:18,183
(Laughing, Are they wearing black lips?)

2213
01:30:18,207 --> 01:30:20,177
(Everyone is copying Kyoka.)

2214
01:30:20,947 --> 01:30:22,286
(I was angry.)

2215
01:30:22,287 --> 01:30:24,786
(I was unfazed, unbothered.)

2216
01:30:24,787 --> 01:30:27,916
(Ruthy Baby's part was similar to that of the Mega Crew Mission.)

2217
01:30:27,917 --> 01:30:30,057
(It didn't seem very new.)

2218
01:30:30,427 --> 01:30:33,557
(I guess she's tired of making new things.)

2219
01:30:33,897 --> 01:30:36,577
(In the cutthroat war of nerves, who will take the hidden section?)

2220
01:30:36,797 --> 01:30:38,566
(For the ticket to the final round, )

2221
01:30:38,567 --> 01:30:40,673
(which crews will participate in the last Elimination Battle?)

2222
01:30:40,697 --> 01:30:42,166
(It could be us.)

2223
01:30:42,167 --> 01:30:44,736
(We cannot end up in that battle ring again.)

2224
01:30:44,737 --> 01:30:46,307
(We do not want to go home.)

2225
01:30:46,407 --> 01:30:47,676
(Sighing)

2226
01:30:47,677 --> 01:30:49,106
(We're in your care.)

2227
01:30:49,107 --> 01:30:51,807
(I don't want to go home at this point.)

2228
01:30:51,907 --> 01:30:53,316
(I'm feeling nervous.)

2229
01:30:53,317 --> 01:30:55,217
(We're going to have to send them home.)

2230
01:30:55,617 --> 01:30:56,846
(Holding hands)

2231
01:30:56,847 --> 01:30:59,086
(We're the roots of Street Woman Fighter.)

2232
01:30:59,087 --> 01:31:00,886
(We can't go home just yet.)

2233
01:31:00,887 --> 01:31:03,727
(Which crews will receive the lowest Global Public Evaluation?)

2234
01:31:03,827 --> 01:31:07,827
(Which of the 4 crews will head to the Elimination Battle?)

2235
01:31:07,927 --> 01:31:09,697
(We can't get eliminated in this round.)

2236
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:13,896
(It's the last chance to advance to the finals.)

2237
01:31:13,897 --> 01:31:16,178
(Which crews will participate in the Elimination Battle?)
