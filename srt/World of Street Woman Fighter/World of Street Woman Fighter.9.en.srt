1
00:00:27,847 --> 00:00:30,277
- Hello. - Hey, guys.

2
00:00:30,302 --> 00:00:32,012
(Pre-filming Zoom meeting)

3
00:00:32,012 --> 00:00:33,142
- Hello. - Hi.

4
00:00:33,142 --> 00:00:34,442
Nice to meet you. I'm Kyoka.

5
00:00:34,442 --> 00:00:35,912
- Hello. - Hello.

6
00:00:35,912 --> 00:00:37,912
- Hello. - Hello.

7
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,982
- And we're MOTIV. - MOTIV.

8
00:00:42,652 --> 00:00:45,122
We have danced with Kirsten many years,

9
00:00:45,122 --> 00:00:46,952
so it was amazing to see...

10
00:00:46,952 --> 00:00:50,592
her and her team on that massive worldwide stage.

11
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,732
It was awesome.

12
00:00:51,732 --> 00:00:55,132
I have never seen a show that gives a spotlight...

13
00:00:55,232 --> 00:00:58,332
to dancers, let alone women like this one.

14
00:00:58,332 --> 00:01:01,972
Internationally, this thing does not come around.

15
00:01:01,972 --> 00:01:05,542
Have that support, but also that competitive energy,

16
00:01:05,542 --> 00:01:06,842
like "Own yourself."

17
00:01:06,842 --> 00:01:09,242
I want to be able to prove myself in that same way...

18
00:01:09,242 --> 00:01:11,952
that the other women on the show did, as well.

19
00:01:12,152 --> 00:01:16,052
I really hope the general public comes to understand...

20
00:01:16,052 --> 00:01:19,652
what it truly means to be a street dancer.

21
00:01:19,652 --> 00:01:21,192
I love the dancers there.

22
00:01:21,192 --> 00:01:23,762
It's really interesting that you guys will be bringing...

23
00:01:23,762 --> 00:01:27,962
people from all over the world into this space.

24
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:31,872
A tiny population from such a small country...

25
00:01:31,872 --> 00:01:35,072
made everything Korean successful for 20 years.

26
00:01:35,072 --> 00:01:36,602
- We're doing great. - Let's believe in ourselves.

27
00:01:36,602 --> 00:01:37,772
I'm confident.

28
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,542
As a representative of Japan,

29
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:41,612
we plan on working hard to achieve great results.

30
00:01:41,612 --> 00:01:43,912
Being from such small little countries,

31
00:01:43,912 --> 00:01:47,522
it is nice to put our flavor and our style on the map.

32
00:01:48,022 --> 00:01:50,792
We're headed to Korea.

33
00:01:51,192 --> 00:01:52,522
(Global dancers were brought together...)

34
00:01:52,522 --> 00:01:54,592
(in Korea by one shared passion, dancing.)

35
00:01:54,592 --> 00:01:55,992
We're from Osaka.

36
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:57,762
We've arrived in Korea.

37
00:01:57,762 --> 00:02:00,362
We are ready for whatever is thrown our way...

38
00:02:00,462 --> 00:02:02,762
and open to whatever challenge.

39
00:02:03,202 --> 00:02:06,172
Six crews representing their countries gathered here in Korea...

40
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:08,642
This is the third battle of women dancers.

41
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:09,672
Period!

42
00:02:09,842 --> 00:02:12,342
This is a global team competition.

43
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:14,442
We have world champions.

44
00:02:14,442 --> 00:02:15,582
The embodiment of waacking.

45
00:02:15,582 --> 00:02:16,912
She is the best among b-girls.

46
00:02:16,912 --> 00:02:18,612
She's like a celebrity among dancers.

47
00:02:18,912 --> 00:02:21,282
With exceptional talent, impressive backgrounds,

48
00:02:21,282 --> 00:02:23,282
and significant careers,

49
00:02:23,282 --> 00:02:26,622
the world's best dancers have gathered at the fight club.

50
00:02:26,752 --> 00:02:28,292
(Dance doesn't lie.)

51
00:02:28,292 --> 00:02:29,962
(Dance is how I win.)

52
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,662
Dance is the language.

53
00:02:31,662 --> 00:02:33,332
These dancers battled...

54
00:02:33,332 --> 00:02:35,832
and proved themselves through dance.

55
00:02:35,832 --> 00:02:38,702
(They have proved themselves through dance.)

56
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,802
The global dance competition has been taken to a whole new level.

57
00:02:42,802 --> 00:02:43,912
(An excerpt from Marlee's interview with Forbes)

58
00:02:43,912 --> 00:02:46,542
I was initially nervous for it to come out...

59
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,982
and people from different parts of the country...

60
00:02:48,982 --> 00:02:51,612
not to understand the storyline.

61
00:02:51,612 --> 00:02:53,252
But to see that this was something...

62
00:02:53,252 --> 00:02:56,052
that was so well received by people all over the world...

63
00:02:56,082 --> 00:02:59,722
AG SQUAD is competing on the smash TV show.

64
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:02,492
It's definitely a highlight of all our careers.

65
00:03:02,492 --> 00:03:04,932
Just being able to dance with these strong girls...

66
00:03:04,932 --> 00:03:07,502
and represent Australia.

67
00:03:07,602 --> 00:03:09,632
The Mega Crew Mission videos,

68
00:03:09,632 --> 00:03:11,632
which captured the essence of each nation's identity,

69
00:03:11,772 --> 00:03:15,072
ranked on the trending video charts of their respective countries...

70
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,802
and gained widespread attention.

71
00:03:16,942 --> 00:03:19,572
The Mega Crew video of Team Korea, BUMSUP,

72
00:03:19,572 --> 00:03:22,912
surpassed 10 million views just 3 days after its release.

73
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:26,052
It set an unprecedented record in the history of the series.

74
00:03:26,512 --> 00:03:29,852
With massive milestones achieved, dancers from around the world...

75
00:03:29,852 --> 00:03:31,922
captured the hearts of international audiences...

76
00:03:31,922 --> 00:03:33,652
and connected with them.

77
00:03:34,262 --> 00:03:37,022
Do not give up, ROYAL FAMILY!

78
00:03:37,022 --> 00:03:38,632
- RHTokyo, you got this! - RHTokyo, you got this!

79
00:03:38,632 --> 00:03:42,302
Street Woman Fighter began in Korea and has now taken the global stage.

80
00:03:46,072 --> 00:03:49,642
And from that legacy, three crews have emerged.

81
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:54,482
Tonight, only one crew will rise as the winner.

82
00:03:55,712 --> 00:03:58,612
World of Street Woman Fighter is supported by...

83
00:03:58,612 --> 00:04:00,312
a leading K-culture brand.

84
00:04:01,122 --> 00:04:03,992
The winning crew takes home a monetary award...

85
00:04:03,992 --> 00:04:07,562
and the iconic WSWF champion's jewelry.

86
00:04:07,722 --> 00:04:11,092
Dancing in Korea has been an amazing experience.

87
00:04:11,092 --> 00:04:14,002
I really want to take that trophy home to Australia.

88
00:04:14,232 --> 00:04:16,562
Team Australia, AG SQUAD.

89
00:04:16,832 --> 00:04:20,132
MOTIV has proven themselves in Korea.

90
00:04:20,132 --> 00:04:22,942
In the finals, we are coming for that win.

91
00:04:23,242 --> 00:04:25,242
Team USA, MOTIV.

92
00:04:25,342 --> 00:04:28,182
Fueled by the spirit of Osaka, we have only one goal.

93
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:29,342
Winning.

94
00:04:29,612 --> 00:04:31,612
Team Japan, OSAKA Ojo Gang.

95
00:04:31,612 --> 00:04:34,182
The final battle between the global street woman fighters...

96
00:04:34,182 --> 00:04:35,652
begins now.

97
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:37,722
Ready? Fight!

Brought to you by Mnet.

100
00:04:57,312 --> 00:05:01,112
Please welcome the finalists of World of Street Woman Fighter.

AG SQUAD.

103
00:06:03,642 --> 00:06:04,672
You ready?

104
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:10,382

OSAKA Ojo Gang.

108
00:07:53,782 --> 00:07:58,492
Make some noise for your host of World of Street Woman Fighter,

109
00:07:58,752 --> 00:08:00,862
Sung Han Bin.

110
00:08:23,312 --> 00:08:26,282
Hello. A global dance competition where the world's fiercest women...

111
00:08:26,282 --> 00:08:28,982
put their pride on the line, World of Street Woman Fighter.

112
00:08:28,982 --> 00:08:30,382
I'm the host, Sung Han Bin.

113
00:08:36,322 --> 00:08:40,432
In 2025, six crews shook the world with nothing but dance.

114
00:08:40,631 --> 00:08:44,902
They stepped onto this stage, each proudly representing their country.

115
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:49,672
In every performance and every battle,

116
00:08:49,672 --> 00:08:51,342
they gave it their all.

117
00:08:51,442 --> 00:08:53,942
Through sheer skill and presence,

118
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:57,582
the six crews represented their countries with pride.

119
00:08:59,852 --> 00:09:02,152
They fought with their nations' pride on the line.

120
00:09:02,252 --> 00:09:05,692
It was an intense journey where they rose stronger in defeat.

121
00:09:06,322 --> 00:09:08,992
Everything has led to this moment.

122
00:09:09,562 --> 00:09:13,562
All that's left is one last showdown with the whole world watching.

123
00:09:16,632 --> 00:09:20,272
Coming up is Team Australia, AG SQUAD.

124
00:09:20,672 --> 00:09:24,002
AG SQUAD. Let's go.

125
00:09:27,682 --> 00:09:30,082
Team USA, MOTIV.

126
00:09:41,222 --> 00:09:44,262
Team Japan, OSAKA Ojo Gang.

127
00:09:51,472 --> 00:09:54,272
Only one of these three crews...

128
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:56,842
will make history as...

129
00:09:56,942 --> 00:09:59,142
the one and only world-class global champion...

130
00:09:59,142 --> 00:10:02,012
on this stage watched by the entire world.

131
00:10:07,112 --> 00:10:09,622
Which crew will take home...

132
00:10:09,822 --> 00:10:13,422
the champion trophy of World of Street Woman Fighter?

133
00:10:25,132 --> 00:10:27,072
Before we officially begin,

134
00:10:27,072 --> 00:10:30,742
let me introduce the fight judges who have been with us...

135
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:34,112
from the very beginning of this show to today's live finals.

136
00:10:34,112 --> 00:10:37,312
Fight Judges Park Jin Young and Mike Song.

137
00:10:39,082 --> 00:10:41,182
And let me introduce our two special judges,

138
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,322
Aliya Janell and Saweetie.

139
00:10:53,692 --> 00:10:55,562
At the heart of the show,

140
00:10:55,662 --> 00:10:58,872
Park Jin Young has been there for every moment with the crews.

141
00:10:59,432 --> 00:11:02,172
Watching the finals must feel deeply meaningful for you.

142
00:11:02,272 --> 00:11:05,272
What will you be looking for today?

143
00:11:09,582 --> 00:11:13,312
As a fight judge, I've witnessed just how much...

144
00:11:13,312 --> 00:11:18,252
the artists, the dancers, prepared in such a short amount of time...

145
00:11:18,252 --> 00:11:20,452
every time they received a new mission.

146
00:11:20,922 --> 00:11:24,592
They've come all this way through unimaginable sweat and tears.

147
00:11:24,692 --> 00:11:28,362
Now that there are no more missions standing in their way,

148
00:11:28,362 --> 00:11:31,872
I'm sure they'll be able to show us their best performances yet.

149
00:11:31,872 --> 00:11:33,702
So I'm just as excited to see what happens.

150
00:11:38,972 --> 00:11:42,142
Thank you. Next up is Fight Judge Mike Song.

151
00:11:42,812 --> 00:11:46,712
Please share a word of encouragement...

152
00:11:46,712 --> 00:11:48,852
for the three crews who will face off in the final round.

153
00:11:50,852 --> 00:11:55,262
Just making it to the World Final itself...

154
00:11:55,262 --> 00:11:57,292
is such an amazing achievement.

155
00:11:57,292 --> 00:12:00,392
So much respect to all the crews,

156
00:12:00,392 --> 00:12:01,532
and I just want to say.

157
00:12:01,632 --> 00:12:02,832
Stay present...

158
00:12:02,832 --> 00:12:05,832
and enjoy these last moments on the Street Woman Fighter stage.

159
00:12:07,132 --> 00:12:10,372
He's right.

160
00:12:11,112 --> 00:12:14,542
Thank you. At the No Respect World Battle,

161
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:16,412
this special judge drew major attention...

162
00:12:16,412 --> 00:12:19,312
with her impactful evaluations and enthusiastic reactions.

163
00:12:19,512 --> 00:12:23,552
Aliya Janell is here with us again tonight for the finals.

164
00:12:28,462 --> 00:12:32,192
How do you feel about the upcoming final performances?

165
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:36,532
I am so happy to be back in Korea.

166
00:12:36,932 --> 00:12:39,502
And I'm so excited...

167
00:12:39,502 --> 00:12:41,772
to just celebrate all of the crews...

168
00:12:41,772 --> 00:12:44,102
and these three specific crews.

169
00:12:44,202 --> 00:12:46,972
And I'm just looking for a great performance, energy,

170
00:12:46,972 --> 00:12:49,882
and greatness.

171
00:12:50,282 --> 00:12:52,152
Yes. Let's do it!

172
00:12:56,122 --> 00:13:00,322
The star of the Global Artist Performance Mission.

173
00:13:02,192 --> 00:13:06,362
The global sensation, Saweetie, is also joining us today.

174
00:13:11,972 --> 00:13:15,442
Today's final performances will take place on the global stage.

175
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:17,602
What are you most looking forward to?

176
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,512
Hi, Korea!

177
00:13:24,612 --> 00:13:26,752
This is my first time here,

178
00:13:26,752 --> 00:13:29,822
and I'm so excited to be sharing this moment with you all.

179
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:32,392
I hope all the girls come on to this stage...

180
00:13:32,392 --> 00:13:34,722
and just have a good time because that's what it's all about.

181
00:13:34,722 --> 00:13:38,362
Have fun and just lose yourself in the moment.

182
00:13:38,362 --> 00:13:40,592
We're here to support, and we're here to love on them.

183
00:13:40,592 --> 00:13:43,762
I'm really excited for tonight, and good luck to all the teams.

184
00:13:49,202 --> 00:13:51,142
And today, we have the pleasure...

185
00:13:51,142 --> 00:13:54,242
of welcoming many guests who share a deep love for dance.

186
00:13:58,082 --> 00:14:00,082
Audiences from around the world...

187
00:14:00,082 --> 00:14:02,382
can join us in real time for the finals,

188
00:14:02,382 --> 00:14:06,822
not only here on site, but also through Mnet Plus and TVING.

189
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,992
We sincerely thank you for the warm support and encouragement...

00:14:11,992 --> 00:14:13,432

We hope you fully enjoy today's final round as well.

192
00:14:21,342 --> 00:14:24,942
We will now begin the finals of World of Street Woman Fighter,

193
00:14:25,372 --> 00:14:28,982
the dance showdown to crown the global champion crew...

194
00:14:29,082 --> 00:14:31,252
that will rock the world stage.

195
00:14:31,252 --> 00:14:34,252
(The ultimate dance showdown of WSWF starts now.)

196
00:14:46,692 --> 00:14:51,632
I will now reveal the final missions of World of Street Woman Fighter.

197
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:56,002
The final round consists of two main missions...

198
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:59,342
and a finale stage for bonus points.

199
00:15:00,642 --> 00:15:03,582
The first main mission is called...

200
00:15:09,352 --> 00:15:11,892
Original SWF Theme Mission, Must Have Scene.

201
00:15:19,162 --> 00:15:21,532
Original SWF Theme Mission, Must Have Scene...

202
00:15:21,632 --> 00:15:26,072
involves rearranging the original theme song to fit each crew...

203
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:29,372
and expressing the most memorable moment...

204
00:15:29,372 --> 00:15:31,042
of the WSWF journey through dance.

205
00:15:32,742 --> 00:15:35,412
Through the Original SWF Theme Mission Song Poll...

206
00:15:35,512 --> 00:15:38,712
conducted on a global music streaming platform,

207
00:15:39,382 --> 00:15:43,452
each crew was paired with the song that received the most votes.

208
00:15:44,422 --> 00:15:48,792
You'll find out which crew has been matched with which song...

209
00:15:49,322 --> 00:15:51,932
in just a moment on stage,

210
00:15:51,932 --> 00:15:53,462
so stay tuned.

211
00:15:57,762 --> 00:16:00,872
Moving on, the second main mission is called...

212
00:16:04,402 --> 00:16:06,672
Crew Identity Mission.

213
00:16:11,682 --> 00:16:13,652
Through the Crew Identity Mission,

214
00:16:13,652 --> 00:16:16,522
each crew will showcase their unique personality and style.

215
00:16:16,922 --> 00:16:18,792
This mission is about showing...

216
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:22,362
who you are as a crew, packed with your identity...

217
00:16:22,722 --> 00:16:25,492
the most raw and symbolic crew performance...

218
00:16:25,492 --> 00:16:29,362
that will unfold in the finals.

219
00:16:33,302 --> 00:16:35,802
The Original SWF Theme Mission, Must Have Scene...

220
00:16:35,802 --> 00:16:38,172
that sums up the journey of WSWF...

221
00:16:38,772 --> 00:16:44,242
and the Crew Identity Mission that fully shows the crew identity...

222
00:16:45,312 --> 00:16:46,852
We ask for your support and attention...

223
00:16:46,852 --> 00:16:49,952
as you witness two performances filled with authenticity and energy,

224
00:16:49,952 --> 00:16:52,492
ready to take over the final stage.

225
00:17:03,762 --> 00:17:06,872
Now, I will explain how the finals will be evaluated...

226
00:17:06,872 --> 00:17:09,642
to decide the winning crew.

227
00:17:11,242 --> 00:17:14,942
Tonight’s one and only world-class crew...

228
00:17:14,942 --> 00:17:16,612
will be decided by combining 30 percent...

229
00:17:16,612 --> 00:17:20,012
from the Final Crew Cheer Theme voting,

230
00:17:20,281 --> 00:17:22,882
70 percent from real-time voting,

231
00:17:22,882 --> 00:17:27,192
and bonus points from the finale stage.

232
00:17:31,932 --> 00:17:34,902
First, the Final Crew Cheer Theme voting...

233
00:17:34,902 --> 00:17:37,302
is a Global Public Early Voting open to viewers...

234
00:17:37,302 --> 00:17:39,102
from all around the world.

235
00:17:39,732 --> 00:17:42,402
It was counted through the official WSWF channel...

236
00:17:42,402 --> 00:17:45,042
from after the July 15 broadcast...

237
00:17:45,042 --> 00:17:48,082
until 6pm on July 20.

238
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:50,982
The voting was closed.

239
00:17:55,122 --> 00:17:57,952
Which crew received the most global support...

240
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,552
in the Final Crew Cheer Theme Early Voting...

241
00:18:00,952 --> 00:18:05,032
held before the final stage?

242
00:18:11,402 --> 00:18:12,832
I will now reveal...

243
00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:17,672
the results of the Final Crew Cheer Theme Voting.

244
00:18:27,252 --> 00:18:32,792
First, we’ll reveal how many likes the first-place crew received...

245
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:35,522

246
00:18:39,392 --> 00:18:42,102

247
00:18:42,102 --> 00:18:44,262
in the Final Crew Cheer Theme Early Voting...

248
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,772
is 234,347.

249
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:58,352

00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:45,562

257
00:19:51,672 --> 00:19:54,202
The second-place crew in the Final Crew Cheer Theme Voting...

258
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:55,742
was AG SQUAD,

259
00:19:56,172 --> 00:19:58,872
and the third-place crew in the Final Crew Cheer Theme Voting...

260
00:19:58,872 --> 00:20:01,272
was MOTIV.

261
00:20:08,482 --> 00:20:12,722
However, the current ranking can always change.

262
00:20:14,092 --> 00:20:16,092
The final ranking of the three crews...

263
00:20:16,092 --> 00:20:18,592
and the crowning of the world-class winning crew...

264
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:22,732
depends on the real-time voting that will soon begin.

265
00:20:24,632 --> 00:20:28,302
This voting accounts for 70 percent of the total score.

Your votes will decide the one and only winning crew.

267
00:20:38,312 --> 00:20:41,382
We are now left with your votes...

268
00:20:41,382 --> 00:20:43,582

269
00:20:44,382 --> 00:20:48,862

00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:28,432
This is the result.

359
00:25:28,432 --> 00:25:30,242
What song we're going to get from the fans.

360
00:25:30,242 --> 00:25:31,342
(They're excited.)

361
00:25:31,472 --> 00:25:34,012
Our fate lies in our fans' hands.

362
00:25:34,272 --> 00:25:36,112
What's this? What are we waiting for?

363
00:25:36,542 --> 00:25:39,312
The most important part of the Original SWF Theme Mission...

364
00:25:39,312 --> 00:25:43,922
is that each crew's mission song will be decided by public voting.

365
00:25:44,152 --> 00:25:46,322
So ours are "CHAMPION" and "SASS."

366
00:25:46,322 --> 00:25:47,422
They're all the same thing.

367
00:25:48,662 --> 00:25:50,462
- We can make this good. - Yes.

368
00:25:50,862 --> 00:25:53,332
That's why we need to come up with great ideas.

369
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:56,402
(What about this?)

370
00:25:56,732 --> 00:25:58,572
We won't do ballad songs anymore.

371
00:25:58,872 --> 00:26:00,672
(Right?)

372
00:26:01,202 --> 00:26:03,372
I hope we don't get a slow song.

373
00:26:03,372 --> 00:26:06,042
- Fingers crossed. Let it be "SASS." - We got this.

374
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:07,042
That is...

375
00:26:09,712 --> 00:26:12,152
(AG SQUAD's mission song is "SASS.")

376
00:26:12,152 --> 00:26:13,552
(Her hopes were met!)

377
00:26:15,682 --> 00:26:17,482
I like this song!

378
00:26:17,582 --> 00:26:19,292
Oh, yes!

379
00:26:19,522 --> 00:26:20,692
Cool.

380
00:26:20,692 --> 00:26:21,992
Yes!

381
00:26:22,292 --> 00:26:23,892
"SASS" is my main choice.

382
00:26:24,122 --> 00:26:25,292
Performance version.

383
00:26:25,832 --> 00:26:27,132
Hot.

384
00:26:27,162 --> 00:26:29,602
(They like it again.)

385
00:26:29,602 --> 00:26:31,832
(Expressing her excitement with her hair)

386
00:26:32,002 --> 00:26:34,232
(They're in their highest spirit.)

387
00:26:34,332 --> 00:26:35,672
It's just us.

388
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:38,472
You know. We're honored to have a song like that.

389
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,642
We're going to take that trophy and go home.

390
00:26:40,942 --> 00:26:42,882
Celebration time is soon. Let's go.

391
00:26:42,982 --> 00:26:46,152
- I'm proud of you all. - AG SQUAD!

392
00:26:46,852 --> 00:26:48,112
We owned that.

393
00:26:48,112 --> 00:26:49,282
(They updated their Korean skills.)

394
00:26:49,282 --> 00:26:50,782
You guys know us so well.

395
00:26:50,982 --> 00:26:52,222
(That moment)

396
00:26:53,852 --> 00:26:56,322
(What is this?)

397
00:26:57,522 --> 00:26:59,132
Must Have Scene.

398
00:26:59,132 --> 00:27:02,562
Memorable scenes of Team Australia, AG SQUAD...

399
00:27:02,562 --> 00:27:04,162
from World of Street Woman Fighter.

400
00:27:04,162 --> 00:27:07,302
Choose the one that stands out the most.

401
00:27:07,572 --> 00:27:09,172
The most memorable thing...

402
00:27:09,172 --> 00:27:11,042
was that when we walked in, people were like...

403
00:27:11,472 --> 00:27:12,542
(They attracted everyone's attention.)

404
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:13,942
Oh my gosh.

405
00:27:14,072 --> 00:27:16,482
(Candidate Scene 1: Their powerful entrance)

406
00:27:16,912 --> 00:27:19,412
We can walk in the same outfit and rip it off.

407
00:27:19,412 --> 00:27:21,012
- Yes. - Yes. Like the leather jackets.

408
00:27:21,082 --> 00:27:23,082
- That's fire. - Yes.

409
00:27:23,182 --> 00:27:25,552
- Maybe our battle scene. - Our battle. Yes.

410
00:27:25,552 --> 00:27:28,592
Right. Our battle versus RHTokyo.

411
00:27:28,592 --> 00:27:30,292
(Candidate Scene 2: AG SQUAD up the cliff)

412
00:27:30,422 --> 00:27:32,462
(They were on the brink of elimination.)

413
00:27:32,962 --> 00:27:34,892
(They geared up with determination.)

414
00:27:34,892 --> 00:27:36,102
(They fought with all they had at the Elimination Battle.)

415
00:27:36,862 --> 00:27:40,702
For the routine, we can just keep incorporating the fighting vibe.

416
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:41,802
(Like the game, "Street Fighter?")

417
00:27:41,802 --> 00:27:42,972
(That's right.)

418
00:27:42,972 --> 00:27:45,002
- Let's go with that. - Street Woman Fighter.

419
00:27:45,572 --> 00:27:47,142
Let's go with that.

420
00:27:47,142 --> 00:27:48,912
- We're like... - Because that's so...

421
00:27:49,142 --> 00:27:51,442
- That's so... - We can stand like this.

422
00:27:51,442 --> 00:27:53,612
We'll make some LED lights,

423
00:27:53,612 --> 00:27:56,382
big swords, strong female,

424
00:27:56,382 --> 00:27:57,622
Street Fighter vibe.

425
00:27:57,622 --> 00:28:00,492
We can take everyone on a journey of fighting.

426
00:28:00,492 --> 00:28:03,292
And we know we can create magic to that song.

427
00:28:03,392 --> 00:28:05,632
- "SASS." - Yes.

428
00:28:05,632 --> 00:28:06,632
Let's go.

429
00:28:06,632 --> 00:28:08,292
We're about to go to rehearsal, guys.

430
00:28:08,292 --> 00:28:11,002
Let's jump on Spotify and find some warm-up.

431
00:28:11,002 --> 00:28:12,272
- Yes. - Maybe Australia?

432
00:28:12,272 --> 00:28:14,032
- Let's do an Aussie mix. - Yes, an Aussie mix.

433
00:28:14,132 --> 00:28:15,942
Let's tap into that.

434
00:28:15,942 --> 00:28:17,602
Just songs to get us in the vibe...

435
00:28:17,602 --> 00:28:19,312
- and the mood to try. - You got me.

436
00:28:19,312 --> 00:28:21,512
Let's see what Aussie songs are popping.

437
00:28:21,672 --> 00:28:23,912
- "Australian times hip-hop?" Okay. - That works.

438
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:25,082
Period.

439
00:28:25,082 --> 00:28:26,112
Let's go.

440
00:28:26,882 --> 00:28:28,282
(Nice)

441
00:28:28,282 --> 00:28:30,622
- Oh, yes. This is my jazz. - Hey.

442
00:28:30,952 --> 00:28:32,822
- This will get us warmed up. - Warmed up.

443
00:28:33,022 --> 00:28:34,822
(They're getting warmed up.)

444
00:28:34,822 --> 00:28:36,922
(Dancing)

445
00:28:37,422 --> 00:28:38,792
You're so cool.

446
00:28:38,962 --> 00:28:40,692
All right. Let's try another playlist.

447
00:28:40,692 --> 00:28:41,862
Sass core.

448
00:28:42,702 --> 00:28:44,132
- The playlist. - Core.

449
00:28:45,002 --> 00:28:46,302
(What?)

450
00:28:46,402 --> 00:28:48,632
- Sorry. - You said "core."

451
00:28:48,802 --> 00:28:52,002
The playlist has so many different vibes and styles.

452
00:28:52,002 --> 00:28:53,772
- It's so good. - Seven, go.

453
00:28:57,442 --> 00:28:58,582
- Seven, go. - Seven, eight.

454
00:28:58,582 --> 00:29:01,552
(Leader's sass core vibe)

455
00:29:02,352 --> 00:29:04,222
(This is the sass core.)

456
00:29:05,522 --> 00:29:08,252
Since it's finals, AG on three. One...

457
00:29:08,792 --> 00:29:10,692
- AG! - AG! Sass!

458
00:29:10,692 --> 00:29:13,492
(What would AG SQUAD's "SASS" be like?)

459
00:29:15,562 --> 00:29:16,762
All in us.

460
00:29:18,662 --> 00:29:20,372
AG SQUAD.

461
00:29:36,522 --> 00:29:38,422
("SASS" by Izna)

462
00:29:39,222 --> 00:29:41,022
(A stage delivering the message that their hunter instinct awakened...)

463
00:29:41,022 --> 00:29:42,362
(through the Elimination Battle with RHTokyo.)

464
00:31:18,922 --> 00:31:20,422
We've watched AG SQUAD's...

465
00:31:20,522 --> 00:31:24,522
Original SWF Theme Mission, Must Have Scene.

466
00:31:29,862 --> 00:31:32,832
The original theme song that was matched with AG SQUAD...

467
00:31:32,832 --> 00:31:36,002
through the Final Original Theme Song Voting...

468
00:31:36,002 --> 00:31:37,972
was "SASS" by Izna.

469
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:45,142
It was a powerful performance that brought out their hunter instinct...

470
00:31:45,142 --> 00:31:47,752
and the energy awakened...

471
00:31:47,752 --> 00:31:50,882
during their Elimination Battle against RH Tokyo.

472
00:31:55,092 --> 00:31:56,762
Fight Judge, Park Jin Young.

473
00:31:57,262 --> 00:31:58,692
How did you find AG SQUAD's...

474
00:31:58,692 --> 00:32:02,162
Original SWF Theme Mission, Must Have Scene stage?

475
00:32:03,962 --> 00:32:05,932
It was more than I expected because...

476
00:32:06,872 --> 00:32:09,242
All the crews have their strengths and weaknesses.

477
00:32:09,242 --> 00:32:10,402
There are no crews without weaknesses.

478
00:32:10,402 --> 00:32:12,942
A team can be strong in one area but weak in another.

479
00:32:12,942 --> 00:32:14,172
It's the same for AG SQUAD.

480
00:32:14,172 --> 00:32:16,512
Of course, they have weak elements as a team.

481
00:32:16,512 --> 00:32:18,512
What is amazing about them is...

482
00:32:18,512 --> 00:32:20,082
they keep improving their weak points...

483
00:32:20,312 --> 00:32:22,752
as the show goes on.

484
00:32:23,082 --> 00:32:26,992
It feels like they keep evolving as the season proceeds.

485
00:32:26,992 --> 00:32:28,322
That was really shocking.

486
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:31,922
In the end, this stage was their best one yet.

487
00:32:32,592 --> 00:32:35,362
All the stages they performed were great,

488
00:32:35,492 --> 00:32:38,202
but this stage was really the best.

489
00:32:38,202 --> 00:32:40,202
Creativity.

490
00:32:41,102 --> 00:32:44,002
They pulled out the swords, threw them, and struck with it.

491
00:32:44,972 --> 00:32:47,472
If I were to give a score today,

492
00:32:47,472 --> 00:32:49,512
I would have given them 100 points for this stage.

493
00:32:49,912 --> 00:32:51,142
I really enjoyed it.

494
00:32:56,522 --> 00:32:59,122
Next, Special Judge Aliya Janell.

495
00:32:59,752 --> 00:33:03,662
What was the most impressive part...

496
00:33:03,662 --> 00:33:06,762
on AG SQUAD's Original SWF Theme Mission, Must Have Scene stage?

497
00:33:08,832 --> 00:33:10,162
Oh my gosh.

498
00:33:10,332 --> 00:33:12,202
From top to bottom.

499
00:33:12,202 --> 00:33:14,472
AG SQUAD, I love you guys so much.

500
00:33:14,472 --> 00:33:18,902
You guys have been so consistent throughout this entire journey.

501
00:33:18,902 --> 00:33:23,512
And it's such a pleasure to watch you guys live.

502
00:33:23,512 --> 00:33:25,312
The moment that I feel like...

503
00:33:26,112 --> 00:33:27,352
Honestly, the beginning.

504
00:33:27,352 --> 00:33:29,252
Did you all see the beginning where they were just like...

505
00:33:29,922 --> 00:33:30,922
You know?

506
00:33:31,452 --> 00:33:32,522
And then, obviously,

507
00:33:32,522 --> 00:33:34,592
the throwing of the sword, that was dope.

508
00:33:34,592 --> 00:33:37,762
I mean, you guys always add something so special.

509
00:33:37,762 --> 00:33:40,062
Something so different. Something that we're not expecting.

510
00:33:40,062 --> 00:33:41,632
And that's what makes you guys so strong.

511
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,702
I really appreciate it.

512
00:33:42,702 --> 00:33:46,102
You guys are it, baby. Thank you all.

513
00:33:50,042 --> 00:33:52,512
Kaea, the leader of AG SQUAD.

514
00:33:53,212 --> 00:33:56,812
We could feel the fiery energy as expected from a final stage.

515
00:33:56,812 --> 00:33:58,212
Please say a few words...

516
00:33:58,212 --> 00:34:01,052
to the fans who supported AG SQUAD.

517
00:34:03,382 --> 00:34:05,552
We are just overwhelmed with gratitude.

518
00:34:05,552 --> 00:34:07,522
You know. We're so thankful to be here.

519
00:34:08,891 --> 00:34:11,692
We never thought we'd be here.

520
00:34:11,692 --> 00:34:15,632
We're just so grateful to be in everyone's presence.

521
00:34:15,632 --> 00:34:16,632
You know...

522
00:34:16,632 --> 00:34:19,572
They are icons that we're performing against.

523
00:34:19,572 --> 00:34:20,902
I mean, "performing for."

524
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:25,002
I'm just lost for words.

525
00:34:26,442 --> 00:34:28,712
Just a lot of emotions. We're just so happy to be here.

526
00:34:28,712 --> 00:34:29,712
Right, girls?

527
00:34:29,712 --> 00:34:32,242
Thank you, everyone.

528
00:34:34,382 --> 00:34:38,782
Please vote for us!

529
00:34:42,492 --> 00:34:45,992

You can also participate in the Real-Time Text Voting...

537
00:35:07,752 --> 00:35:14,552
by sending AG SQUAD or number 1 to 0011.

538
00:35:18,822 --> 00:35:21,262
That was AG SQUAD.

539
00:35:21,262 --> 00:35:22,332
Thank you.

540
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:49,222
The next crew performing...

541
00:35:49,222 --> 00:35:51,662
on the Original SWF Theme Mission, Must Have Scene...

542
00:35:55,662 --> 00:35:58,862
is Team USA, MOTIV.

543
00:36:03,902 --> 00:36:06,512
MOTIV is an old-school hip-hop crew...

544
00:36:06,512 --> 00:36:09,072
representing the US, bringing individuality...

545
00:36:09,072 --> 00:36:12,552
and energy to the stage, rooted in the heart of hip-hop.

546
00:36:12,952 --> 00:36:14,982
Which original SWF theme song...

547
00:36:14,982 --> 00:36:19,052
did the global dance-loving audience choose for MOTIV?

548
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:25,022
What Must Have Scene is captured in their song?

549
00:36:25,522 --> 00:36:27,932
Let's check that out right away.

550
00:36:31,832 --> 00:36:34,102
Team USA, MOTIV.

551
00:36:34,202 --> 00:36:36,572
Ready? Fight!

552
00:36:43,212 --> 00:36:46,582
I think the first song definitely suits us more.

553
00:36:46,812 --> 00:36:48,182
"CHAMPION." Alright.

554
00:36:48,182 --> 00:36:49,482
"CHAMPION."

555
00:36:49,482 --> 00:36:51,222
("CHAMPION" receives 3 votes.)

556
00:36:53,652 --> 00:36:55,292
Song matching results.

557
00:36:55,792 --> 00:36:57,222
- Wait. We're finding out right now? - Yes.

558
00:36:57,222 --> 00:36:58,462
(She's nervous.)

559
00:36:58,462 --> 00:37:00,092
(What song was matched with MOTIV?)

560
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:05,132
- I don't like it. - What?

561
00:37:06,832 --> 00:37:08,432
(It has come to us.)

562
00:37:09,032 --> 00:37:10,072
I knew it.

563
00:37:10,572 --> 00:37:11,772
(Screaming)

564
00:37:11,972 --> 00:37:13,142
Hopeful.

565
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:14,972
(In despair)

566
00:37:14,972 --> 00:37:17,212
Okay. But now, AG SQUAD is going to be like...

567
00:37:17,912 --> 00:37:19,912
(Powerful, Confident)

568
00:37:20,012 --> 00:37:21,312
And then, we come in, and we are like...

569
00:37:21,712 --> 00:37:23,382
(Calm)

570
00:37:25,252 --> 00:37:26,652
That is a disadvantage.

571
00:37:26,652 --> 00:37:28,822
- Sonically, it's hard to compete. - Yes.

572
00:37:28,822 --> 00:37:30,692
Maybe that's what people want to see.

573
00:37:30,692 --> 00:37:32,092
They want to see a good time?

574
00:37:32,392 --> 00:37:34,162
- Well... - Not everyone wants...

575
00:37:34,162 --> 00:37:35,692
Is remixing a thing?

576
00:37:36,262 --> 00:37:38,762
- MOTIV version. - MOTIV version remix.

577
00:37:38,762 --> 00:37:40,232
(The remix is played.)

578
00:37:40,232 --> 00:37:42,232
(It's awesome.)

579
00:37:42,502 --> 00:37:43,772
It's a different song.

580
00:37:44,602 --> 00:37:45,742
It's not bad.

581
00:37:46,342 --> 00:37:48,412
I'm not mad at all. Thank goodness.

582
00:37:48,512 --> 00:37:50,282
Gosh. Thank you.

583
00:37:54,652 --> 00:37:55,882
Okay!

584
00:37:56,082 --> 00:37:57,382
(I like this remix version.)

585
00:37:57,382 --> 00:37:58,382
It's giving...

586
00:37:58,382 --> 00:38:00,252
(It's exciting.)

587
00:38:00,552 --> 00:38:03,362
(They automatically create the choreography.)

588
00:38:03,362 --> 00:38:05,422
Okay. That's better.

589
00:38:06,062 --> 00:38:07,692
I can work with that.

590
00:38:07,692 --> 00:38:09,562
Let's kill this!

591
00:38:10,902 --> 00:38:12,532
- "Must Have Scene." - Oh my gosh.

592
00:38:13,102 --> 00:38:14,632
- Goodness. - But...

593
00:38:14,872 --> 00:38:16,202
- The ending fairy? - Okay.

594
00:38:16,402 --> 00:38:18,142
- Exactly. The ending fairy. - That's memorable.

595
00:38:18,642 --> 00:38:19,642
(Peekaboo)

596
00:38:19,642 --> 00:38:20,742
(During the stage introduction of the World of K-pop Mission)

597
00:38:23,412 --> 00:38:25,682
(Charming)

598
00:38:26,152 --> 00:38:28,752
(Their first experience in doing the ending fairy.)

599
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:32,252
(Pure)

600
00:38:32,252 --> 00:38:34,992
(The ending fairy left a strong impression.)

601
00:38:35,552 --> 00:38:36,592
(Thinking)

602
00:38:36,592 --> 00:38:37,722
I need to think.

603
00:38:38,392 --> 00:38:40,132
The ending fairy? I'm dead.

604
00:38:40,832 --> 00:38:44,802
Oh, yes. I would say my most memorable moment was...

605
00:38:44,902 --> 00:38:47,272
the battle with Honey J...

606
00:38:47,272 --> 00:38:49,542
and going up to you guys and just getting...

607
00:38:49,642 --> 00:38:51,972
the energy from all of you when we did that.

608
00:38:52,202 --> 00:38:53,372
(No Respect World Battle)

609
00:38:54,742 --> 00:38:56,142
Those are my people.

610
00:38:56,142 --> 00:38:59,242
You're battling just me, but you're always battling all of us.

611
00:38:59,242 --> 00:39:01,112
(MOTIV became one and enjoyed the battle.)

612
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:02,512
That was fire.

613
00:39:02,982 --> 00:39:04,222
That was crazy.

614
00:39:04,652 --> 00:39:06,692
To play with light would be fun.

615
00:39:06,892 --> 00:39:08,622
Just like finding another way to make it...

616
00:39:08,622 --> 00:39:11,122
more theatrical since the song is more theatrical.

617
00:39:12,292 --> 00:39:15,332
And just being intrigued in seeing how...

618
00:39:15,532 --> 00:39:17,562
Marlee's vision is going to come to life...

619
00:39:17,562 --> 00:39:19,802
and how we're really going to sell this message...

620
00:39:19,802 --> 00:39:22,802
and deliver this story to the audience.

621
00:39:23,172 --> 00:39:26,942
Like who else is going to kill "Always a Good Time" except us?

622
00:39:27,572 --> 00:39:29,242
And so we rise to the top...

623
00:39:29,642 --> 00:39:31,112
because it's always a good time.

624
00:39:31,112 --> 00:39:33,082
- It's always a good time. - It's always a good time.

625
00:39:33,082 --> 00:39:35,752
- Let's go! - Yes!

626
00:39:36,722 --> 00:39:37,882
Let's go!

627
00:39:37,882 --> 00:39:39,392
- Let's go! - Let's go!

628
00:39:39,392 --> 00:39:41,592
(What would MOTIV's "Always a Good Time" be like?)

629
00:39:58,042 --> 00:40:00,412
("Always a Good Time" by ASH ISLAND)

630
00:40:01,812 --> 00:40:03,112
(A stage capturing the moment when leader Marlee came to dance...)

631
00:40:03,112 --> 00:40:04,282
(with the crew in the first battle, reminding us...)

632
00:40:04,282 --> 00:40:05,412
(of the love, energy, and deep bond that drive MOTIV forward.)

633
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:47,952
- MOTIV! - MOTIV!

634
00:41:47,952 --> 00:41:51,482
We've watched MOTIV's Original SWF Theme Mission,

635
00:41:51,582 --> 00:41:52,622
Must Have Scene stage.

636
00:41:58,822 --> 00:42:01,662
The original theme song that was matched with MOTIV...

637
00:42:02,092 --> 00:42:04,702
through the Final Original Theme Song Voting...

638
00:42:04,802 --> 00:42:07,732
was "Always a Good Time" by ASH ISLAND.

639
00:42:10,472 --> 00:42:14,042
Even under sudden spotlight, MOTIV stayed steady,

640
00:42:14,142 --> 00:42:17,812
making it this far through teamwork and strong bonds.

641
00:42:18,442 --> 00:42:21,452
It was a stage filled with energy and joy they feel...

642
00:42:21,452 --> 00:42:22,922
when they dance together.

643
00:42:26,022 --> 00:42:27,952
Special Judge Saweetie.

644
00:42:28,622 --> 00:42:32,122
How did you find MOTIV's Original SWF Theme Mission,

645
00:42:32,322 --> 00:42:33,392
Must Have Scene stage?

646
00:42:36,332 --> 00:42:38,302
Hey, MOTIV!

647
00:42:38,302 --> 00:42:39,932
- Hey, MOTIV! - MOTIV!

648
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:44,372
Representing the USA. I know. That's right.

649
00:42:46,672 --> 00:42:49,112
For one, it's one thing to do it well,

650
00:42:49,112 --> 00:42:51,682
but it's another thing to do it well with your sisters.

651
00:42:51,682 --> 00:42:54,582
And I felt the unity. I felt the love.

652
00:42:54,582 --> 00:42:56,522
And I felt like you guys were having fun.

653
00:42:56,522 --> 00:42:58,452
You guys looked so good doing it.

654
00:42:58,452 --> 00:43:02,322
And for what stood out to me, it was the precision.

655
00:43:02,422 --> 00:43:04,462
Precision.

656
00:43:04,462 --> 00:43:06,932
I might not know how many hours you guys put in,

657
00:43:07,032 --> 00:43:10,262
but I felt it. It was so precise, but it felt so effortless.

658
00:43:10,362 --> 00:43:11,802
So shout out to you guys,

659
00:43:11,802 --> 00:43:14,932
and thank you for representing the USA. I know. That's right.

660
00:43:19,102 --> 00:43:21,512
Next, Fight Judge Park Jin Young.

661
00:43:21,712 --> 00:43:24,912
What did you think about MOTIV's stage?

662
00:43:29,312 --> 00:43:33,492
If MOTIV wasn't on World of Street Woman Fighter,

663
00:43:34,092 --> 00:43:37,422
I don't think this show would have had the groove.

664
00:43:37,522 --> 00:43:40,532
You brought groove into this show.

665
00:43:45,162 --> 00:43:47,772
First of all, this song is a slow song.

666
00:43:47,772 --> 00:43:50,642
So it's very difficult to use it to excite the audience.

667
00:43:50,642 --> 00:43:53,742
I would have been so worried if I received this song.

668
00:43:53,842 --> 00:43:57,512
It was way slower than the previous song.

669
00:43:57,512 --> 00:43:59,212
This was a slow song.

670
00:43:59,312 --> 00:44:02,582
And we never felt it was slow.

671
00:44:04,082 --> 00:44:08,092
And... Marlee, you as a leader,

672
00:44:08,092 --> 00:44:11,292
you gave every member a chance to shine.

673
00:44:17,932 --> 00:44:20,032
Sometimes, you're so savage,

674
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:22,572
but sometimes you're so cerebral.

675
00:44:22,672 --> 00:44:26,242
She thinks very intellectually,

676
00:44:26,242 --> 00:44:27,912
but sometimes she is very instinctive.

677
00:44:28,842 --> 00:44:32,012
You guys were all great. But I just had to tell you, Marlee.

678
00:44:32,012 --> 00:44:34,312
You are a very special leader.

679
00:44:35,852 --> 00:44:36,982
I enjoyed it.

680
00:44:37,452 --> 00:44:38,952
Thank you.

681
00:44:42,322 --> 00:44:44,392
Marlee, MOTIV's leader.

682
00:44:45,062 --> 00:44:48,662
Your crew's powerful presence in the final stage was impressive.

683
00:44:49,192 --> 00:44:52,762
Please say a few words to the fans who support MOTIV.

684
00:44:53,572 --> 00:44:57,172
I just want to say to everyone supporting us,

685
00:44:57,172 --> 00:44:58,442
our motivators...

686
00:44:58,442 --> 00:45:01,172
It means the world to us...

687
00:45:01,272 --> 00:45:03,842
to be so far away from home.

688
00:45:04,142 --> 00:45:07,482
It's such a risk to come on stage and not conform.

689
00:45:07,482 --> 00:45:09,782
No matter the circumstances, no matter the challenge,

690
00:45:09,782 --> 00:45:10,852
no matter the mission.

691
00:45:10,952 --> 00:45:13,792
So we're so grateful that we've come this far...

692
00:45:13,792 --> 00:45:15,922
representing ourselves in the truest way.

693
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:17,722
So thank you.

694
00:45:21,792 --> 00:45:24,632
MOTIV showed us their heavy presence...

695
00:45:24,632 --> 00:45:26,102
with focused moves.

696
00:45:26,202 --> 00:45:28,502
If you want to hand the trophy to them,

697
00:45:28,602 --> 00:45:32,142
support them now through Real-Time Global Online Voting...

699
00:45:36,882 --> 00:45:38,812

And you can participate in Real-Time Text Voting...

702
00:45:46,592 --> 00:45:50,192
by sending MOTIV or the number 2 to 0011.

703
00:45:54,062 --> 00:45:57,402
That was MOTIV's stage. Thank you.

704
00:45:57,402 --> 00:45:59,402
Thank you!

705
00:46:12,482 --> 00:46:13,712
The next crew performing...

706
00:46:13,712 --> 00:46:16,012
on the Original SWF Theme Mission, Must Have Scene is...

707
00:46:18,922 --> 00:46:22,092
Team Japan, OSAKA Ojo Gang.

708
00:46:26,692 --> 00:46:28,292
OSAKA Ojo Gang is...

709
00:46:28,292 --> 00:46:32,032
an all-rounder crew that represents Japan...

710
00:46:32,032 --> 00:46:34,672
with their unique style and natural charisma.

711
00:46:35,232 --> 00:46:37,702
Which original SWF theme song...

712
00:46:37,702 --> 00:46:41,912
did the global dance-loving audience choose for OSAKA Ojo Gang?

713
00:46:42,412 --> 00:46:46,012
Also, what will be the moment of the OSAKA Ojo Gang...

714
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:48,752
for the Must Have Scene in the theme song?

715
00:46:48,752 --> 00:46:50,982
Let's find out now.

716
00:46:52,552 --> 00:46:54,892
Team Japan, OSAKA Ojo Gang.

717
00:46:55,192 --> 00:46:56,192
Ready.

718
00:46:56,662 --> 00:46:57,662
Fight!

719
00:47:05,702 --> 00:47:07,632
It's the Original SWF Theme Mission.

720
00:47:07,632 --> 00:47:10,672
We had one we really liked, didn't we?

721
00:47:10,672 --> 00:47:11,742
Did you have one?

722
00:47:11,742 --> 00:47:13,042
I had one.

723
00:47:13,042 --> 00:47:14,672
- Let's say it together on three. - Okay.

724
00:47:14,972 --> 00:47:16,312
Two, three.

725
00:47:16,582 --> 00:47:17,582
- "CHAMPION." - "CHAMPION."

726
00:47:17,582 --> 00:47:19,682
(Unanimously, "CHAMPION!")

727
00:47:19,882 --> 00:47:21,382
We just said this,

728
00:47:21,382 --> 00:47:22,952
but what if it's something different?

729
00:47:22,952 --> 00:47:24,152
Like a ballad song.

730
00:47:24,452 --> 00:47:25,552
Should we reconsider it?

731
00:47:25,552 --> 00:47:26,922
Aren't you nervous?

732
00:47:26,922 --> 00:47:28,352
Yes, I'm starting to get nervous.

733
00:47:28,352 --> 00:47:29,392
Please.

734
00:47:31,992 --> 00:47:33,092
Please.

735
00:47:33,092 --> 00:47:35,092
("CHAMPION," it is.)

736
00:47:35,092 --> 00:47:37,362
(We won.)

737
00:47:37,362 --> 00:47:38,662
(Thank you.)

738
00:47:38,662 --> 00:47:39,972
What a relief.

739
00:47:39,972 --> 00:47:41,772
- We'll win this. - We won.

740
00:47:41,772 --> 00:47:43,072
Thank you.

741
00:47:43,072 --> 00:47:44,242
(Thank you for voting.)

742
00:47:45,372 --> 00:47:46,372
- What? - What?

743
00:47:46,372 --> 00:47:47,672
Must Have Scene.

744
00:47:47,672 --> 00:47:49,712
It's difficult.

745
00:47:49,712 --> 00:47:50,782
This one.

746
00:47:50,782 --> 00:47:52,142
Let's do Kyoka's punch.

747
00:47:52,142 --> 00:47:53,882
(Everyone agrees.)

748
00:47:54,182 --> 00:47:55,182
(During the Class Mission)

749
00:47:55,182 --> 00:47:56,182
(What? Worst dancer nominee?)

750
00:47:56,352 --> 00:47:58,952
(Don't be ridiculous!)

751
00:47:59,052 --> 00:48:01,052
(Kyoka's powerful punch during the Class Mission)

752
00:48:01,422 --> 00:48:02,452
Kyoka's punch.

753
00:48:02,452 --> 00:48:03,862
A nominee for the worst dancer.

754
00:48:03,862 --> 00:48:06,692
Hana's effort during the World of K-pop Mission...

755
00:48:06,692 --> 00:48:08,362
was unforgettable.

756
00:48:08,592 --> 00:48:10,662
(During the filming of the World of K-pop Mission)

757
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,732
(Backflip after lots of hard work)

758
00:48:12,732 --> 00:48:15,172
(Hana successfully performed the tough technique for the crew.)

759
00:48:15,472 --> 00:48:16,872
(I did that.)

760
00:48:16,972 --> 00:48:18,442
Should I do a backflip again?

761
00:48:18,672 --> 00:48:21,072
I believe fans would love to see it.

762
00:48:21,242 --> 00:48:22,342
I'll do my best.

763
00:48:23,072 --> 00:48:27,582
The one I put all my energy into was the Mega Crew Mission.

764
00:48:27,882 --> 00:48:30,882
(During the Mega Crew Mission, there were about 100 dancers.)

765
00:48:30,952 --> 00:48:34,322
(They used lightsticks for the Mega Crew Performance.)

766
00:48:35,022 --> 00:48:36,662
- It was really impressive. - Yes.

767
00:48:36,862 --> 00:48:38,922
I want to show people how incredible it is...

768
00:48:38,922 --> 00:48:40,462
when they see it in person.

769
00:48:40,462 --> 00:48:42,362
It shows clearly what OSAKA Ojo Gang is like.

770
00:48:43,032 --> 00:48:45,362
Uwa, what is the most memorable moment for you?

771
00:48:45,362 --> 00:48:48,032
It's our first Elimination Battle.

772
00:48:48,472 --> 00:48:49,602
(Group Battle of the first Elimination Battle)

773
00:48:49,602 --> 00:48:50,602
(Stealing the crown)

774
00:48:51,372 --> 00:48:52,972
No need for this crown. Bye.

775
00:48:53,872 --> 00:48:58,082
(They performed as if stamping on the opponent's crown.)

776
00:48:58,442 --> 00:49:00,252
In the last part, we'll take the crown...

777
00:49:00,752 --> 00:49:02,882
from ROYAL FAMILY and put it on our heads.

778
00:49:03,522 --> 00:49:04,522
(I like that.)

779
00:49:04,682 --> 00:49:05,682
It means we respect each other.

780
00:49:06,892 --> 00:49:09,152
We can do it all, can't we?

781
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:10,622
I think people will love it a lot...

782
00:49:10,622 --> 00:49:12,322
if they see scenes they've seen before.

783
00:49:13,022 --> 00:49:15,892
This time, Midoris...

784
00:49:15,892 --> 00:49:17,832
voted for us...

785
00:49:17,832 --> 00:49:21,672
and went out of their way to support us.

786
00:49:21,672 --> 00:49:23,602
We, OSAKA Ojo Gang, will do our best...

787
00:49:23,602 --> 00:49:25,972
to win the final mission.

788
00:49:26,502 --> 00:49:29,412
- OSAKA Ojo Gang. - OSAKA Ojo Gang.

789
00:49:29,412 --> 00:49:33,912
(What kind of performance will OSAKA Ojo Gang give for "CHAMPION?")

790
00:49:49,662 --> 00:49:52,262
("CHAMPION," OSAKA Ojo Gang Remix, by Sung Han Bin of ZEROBASEONE)

791
00:49:53,132 --> 00:49:54,502
(A stage that shows their journey to the championship in WSWF,)

792
00:49:54,502 --> 00:49:55,872
(battling six crews, staying true to their style,)

793
00:49:55,872 --> 00:49:57,302
(and saying "don't be ridiculous" no matter how many times they lost.)

794
00:51:34,902 --> 00:51:37,642
That was OSAKA Ojo Gang's performance...

795
00:51:37,642 --> 00:51:40,072
of the Original SWF Theme Mission, Must Have Scene stage.

796
00:51:44,912 --> 00:51:48,112
The song matched to OSAKA Ojo Gang through the song matching voting...

797
00:51:48,112 --> 00:51:51,282
for the Final Original SWF Theme Mission...

798
00:51:51,282 --> 00:51:53,422
was the original SWF theme song...

799
00:51:53,422 --> 00:51:56,052
that I took part in singing, "CHAMPION."

800
00:52:00,432 --> 00:52:03,292
OSAKA Ojo Gang has pushed their style all the way...

801
00:52:03,292 --> 00:52:07,172
and has fiercely raced towards victory.

802
00:52:07,702 --> 00:52:10,702
It was a performance that fully revealed their champion's journey...

803
00:52:11,102 --> 00:52:15,012
as heroes, legends, and fighters.

804
00:52:16,272 --> 00:52:18,212
Special Judge Saweetie.

805
00:52:18,642 --> 00:52:20,112
OSAKA Ojo Gang's performance...

806
00:52:20,112 --> 00:52:22,682
of the Original SWF Theme Mission, Must Have Scene stage.

807
00:52:22,812 --> 00:52:23,922
How was it for you?

808
00:52:29,792 --> 00:52:31,062
First of all, ladies.

809
00:52:31,062 --> 00:52:33,792
First of all, don't ever come on that stage with some helmets.

810
00:52:33,792 --> 00:52:35,262
You almost took me out.

811
00:52:36,032 --> 00:52:38,462
So creative. So artsy.

812
00:52:38,832 --> 00:52:40,002
I was so shocked.

813
00:52:40,002 --> 00:52:41,532
You know I love the fog.

814
00:52:41,532 --> 00:52:44,542
Anybody who watched the last competition.

815
00:52:44,542 --> 00:52:46,142
I love the fog.

816
00:52:46,142 --> 00:52:48,012
You guys came out with the bag, swinging.

817
00:52:48,012 --> 00:52:50,482
I love the helmets. I love the execution.

818
00:52:50,482 --> 00:52:52,912
I love the facial expressions. I love the hair.

819
00:52:52,912 --> 00:52:55,052
You know I like the hairstyle.

820
00:52:55,252 --> 00:52:57,022
You guys look so beautiful.

821
00:52:57,352 --> 00:52:59,152
You guys are so talented.

822
00:52:59,452 --> 00:53:02,092
Shout out to you guys. I'm in awe right now.

823
00:53:02,092 --> 00:53:03,592
You guys gave me chills.

824
00:53:03,592 --> 00:53:05,822
So, shout out to you guys. Thank you for that.

825
00:53:10,092 --> 00:53:12,302
Next, Fight Judge Mike Song.

826
00:53:12,962 --> 00:53:14,432
In OSAKA Ojo Gang's performance...

827
00:53:14,432 --> 00:53:17,102
of the Original SWF Theme Mission Must Have Scene stage,

828
00:53:17,102 --> 00:53:19,842
what was the most impressive?

829
00:53:22,672 --> 00:53:24,212
OSAKA Ojo Gang is really...

830
00:53:24,912 --> 00:53:27,412
good at creating special scenes.

831
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:30,422
There were many moments from this season,

832
00:53:30,422 --> 00:53:32,582
and I felt like you guys were the only crew...

833
00:53:32,582 --> 00:53:34,822
that really took me through the whole season.

834
00:53:35,022 --> 00:53:38,062
We really got to see storytelling through all of your moments.

835
00:53:38,062 --> 00:53:41,592
And to set that up and make it entertaining. To bring that back.

836
00:53:41,592 --> 00:53:45,202
Hana, when you did a flip, there's a story behind that.

837
00:53:45,432 --> 00:53:47,932
To Kyoka, doing the punch. Setting that up.

838
00:53:47,932 --> 00:53:51,672
That is all entertainment quality that you guys brought...

839
00:53:51,672 --> 00:53:53,712
that makes you guys so memorable.

840
00:53:53,712 --> 00:53:55,472
You guys have such an image...

841
00:53:55,472 --> 00:53:58,012
that is going to stay with this audience forever.

842
00:53:58,012 --> 00:53:59,412
So, congratulations.

843
00:54:03,852 --> 00:54:06,352
Ibuki, the leader of the OSAKA Ojo Gang.

844
00:54:07,052 --> 00:54:11,262
I felt a strong atmosphere and profound energy on your stage.

845
00:54:11,622 --> 00:54:15,562
Please say a few words to the fans who support OSAKA Ojo Gang.

846
00:54:17,402 --> 00:54:20,532
Midoris around the world, are you watching?

847
00:54:23,172 --> 00:54:26,072
It was a song called "CHAMPION."

848
00:54:26,072 --> 00:54:28,872
This is the theme song of Season Three,

849
00:54:28,872 --> 00:54:30,282
so you all probably know it.

850
00:54:30,282 --> 00:54:33,882
First of all, we were so happy that this song was selected.

851
00:54:33,882 --> 00:54:39,982
As it showed the champion road from the lowest to the champion,

852
00:54:39,982 --> 00:54:41,952
I hope you enjoyed this work.

853
00:54:41,952 --> 00:54:45,562
Midoris and OSAKA Ojo Gang, let's be the champions together.

854
00:54:50,702 --> 00:54:53,602
If you want to give the championship trophy...

855
00:54:53,602 --> 00:54:57,042
to OSAKA Ojo Gang, who showed their own colors...

856
00:54:57,042 --> 00:54:59,542

We watched all the performances of the three finalist crews...

865
00:55:44,552 --> 00:55:48,652
for the Original SWF Theme Mission Must Have Scene.

866
00:55:49,592 --> 00:55:52,792
Three crews created memorable scenes...

867
00:55:52,792 --> 00:55:54,332
in their own unique ways,

868
00:55:54,332 --> 00:55:57,632
narrating their WSWF's journeys.

869
00:55:58,302 --> 00:56:02,702
Who will take the final victory?

870
00:56:05,142 --> 00:56:07,972
Tonight, with the whole world watching,

871
00:56:07,972 --> 00:56:12,512
a world-class champion crew will rise.

872
00:56:13,612 --> 00:56:16,082

Please vote now.

874
00:56:24,762 --> 00:56:27,992
We'll continue World of Street Woman Fighter.

875
00:56:27,992 --> 00:56:29,992
The second main mission.

876
00:56:31,102 --> 00:56:33,402
It's Crew Identity Mission.

877
00:56:33,402 --> 00:56:35,702
(The second main mission Crew Identity Mission)

878
00:56:38,342 --> 00:56:40,002
Now it's time for each crew...

879
00:56:40,002 --> 00:56:43,412
to take the stage and prove who they are...

880
00:56:43,412 --> 00:56:47,612
by showcasing their unique identity and style.

881
00:56:48,352 --> 00:56:52,982
A stage with music and performances created by each crew.

882
00:56:54,022 --> 00:56:56,752
The first crew that will take the stage.

883
00:57:01,592 --> 00:57:05,062
It's Team Australia, AG SQUAD.

884
00:57:10,402 --> 00:57:14,012
AG SQUAD stood out with their energetic performances...

885
00:57:14,012 --> 00:57:17,982
throughout the entire WSWF journey.

886
00:57:18,712 --> 00:57:21,012
In particular, during the semi-final mission,

887
00:57:21,012 --> 00:57:23,012
they secured both bonus points and the top spot...

888
00:57:23,012 --> 00:57:25,522
in the Global Public Evaluation for the two missions,

889
00:57:25,782 --> 00:57:29,822
becoming the first team to make it to the final list.

890
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:34,492
They say this stage represents their identity clearly,

891
00:57:34,662 --> 00:57:38,032
so that they can say, "We are AG SQUAD,"

892
00:57:38,032 --> 00:57:40,432
without needing any further explanation.

893
00:57:41,372 --> 00:57:43,302
How will AG SQUAD express...

894
00:57:43,302 --> 00:57:47,172
their identity through dance?

895
00:57:48,772 --> 00:57:51,612
Team Australia, AG SQUAD.

896
00:57:52,012 --> 00:57:54,182
Ready. Fight!

897
00:58:01,092 --> 00:58:04,262
We got our new missions for the finals, girls. How do you feel?

898
00:58:04,322 --> 00:58:06,562
If I'm being honest, I didn't think we would.

899
00:58:06,562 --> 00:58:08,962
- Yes, right. - Absolutely. We're a new team.

900
00:58:08,962 --> 00:58:12,932
This is the big break we deserved for ourselves.

901
00:58:12,932 --> 00:58:13,972
Yes.

902
00:58:13,972 --> 00:58:15,172
Why am I going to cry?

903
00:58:15,172 --> 00:58:17,302
Cry. It's okay. Goodness.

904
00:58:20,172 --> 00:58:21,412
You let it out.

905
00:58:22,142 --> 00:58:23,572
Oh, my gosh.

906
00:58:23,572 --> 00:58:26,382
It's okay. It's because she's worked so hard.

907
00:58:26,382 --> 00:58:28,312
Yes, period. She has.

908
00:58:29,152 --> 00:58:31,252
I think it's because I wasn't going to do it.

909
00:58:32,152 --> 00:58:34,422
Because I didn't believe in myself just yet.

910
00:58:35,122 --> 00:58:38,392
I felt like I wasn't at my best.

911
00:58:38,392 --> 00:58:40,122
I was teaching dance crews,

912
00:58:40,122 --> 00:58:42,232
not performing myself.

913
00:58:42,532 --> 00:58:46,132
So that's one big thing that I had to overcome, and...

914
00:58:46,132 --> 00:58:48,332
once again, I just needed to believe in myself.

915
00:58:48,332 --> 00:58:50,002
But this just proves it.

916
00:58:50,002 --> 00:58:51,372
I'm good at what I do.

917
00:58:51,372 --> 00:58:53,202
- So... - For sure.

918
00:58:53,202 --> 00:58:54,242
Yes.

919
00:58:54,342 --> 00:58:56,512
I'm very grateful to have done it. And...

920
00:58:56,512 --> 00:58:58,412
finally, I started creating again.

921
00:58:58,412 --> 00:59:00,652
Because I forgot how much I love it. So...

922
00:59:00,712 --> 00:59:02,852
And how good you are at it.

923
00:59:02,852 --> 00:59:04,682
(A chance to rediscover the "me" I had forgotten)

924
00:59:04,682 --> 00:59:06,582
We're very strong individuals.

925
00:59:06,582 --> 00:59:09,052
We're the most powerful team on the show.

926
00:59:09,292 --> 00:59:11,662
So when we were browsing about ideas,

927
00:59:11,662 --> 00:59:14,832
we wanted something attacking, strong...

928
00:59:15,062 --> 00:59:17,462
- Bad. - Bad girls.

929
00:59:17,702 --> 00:59:19,732
Because that's what AG SQUAD is. We're...

930
00:59:19,732 --> 00:59:21,172
a team of strong females.

931
00:59:21,302 --> 00:59:24,842
We're starting with a really strong quote at the beginning.

932
00:59:25,342 --> 00:59:28,542
We really want to show you our power as a team.

933
00:59:29,042 --> 00:59:30,172
This is final.

934
00:59:30,172 --> 00:59:32,712
So, we need to give everything we got.

935
00:59:32,712 --> 00:59:34,082
(Ready to give it all with all power)

936
00:59:35,652 --> 00:59:37,522
How was the training?

937
00:59:38,422 --> 00:59:40,122
Hello.

938
00:59:40,992 --> 00:59:43,422
(Someone is waiting for the members.)

939
00:59:43,852 --> 00:59:45,492
Hi, Mom!

940
00:59:46,862 --> 00:59:49,592
(Kaea and Ruthy Baby's mother came to Korea for their final.)

941
00:59:49,592 --> 00:59:53,162
Hello. I'm Marian, and I'm Kaea and Ruthy Baby's mom.

942
00:59:53,562 --> 00:59:57,132
Watching her dance with her sister and her friend Kyra again,

943
00:59:57,132 --> 00:59:58,702
I'm so proud of them.

944
00:59:58,702 --> 01:00:00,172
Because they did have a break.

945
01:00:00,172 --> 01:00:03,272
Kaea had her children, and she had kind of lost it.

946
01:00:03,272 --> 01:00:04,842
(Emotional)

947
01:00:05,382 --> 01:00:07,182
She had lost that spark.

948
01:00:07,852 --> 01:00:10,922
When she was younger, she lived to dance.

949
01:00:11,622 --> 01:00:14,452
So, this show has provided her with...

950
01:00:14,452 --> 01:00:18,092
the drive and the determination that I haven't seen for years.

951
01:00:18,392 --> 01:00:22,492
And that's been the highlight of this whole experience.

952
01:00:22,762 --> 01:00:23,962
My baby.

953
01:00:23,962 --> 01:00:25,102
(Their mother came to be with them at the end of their journey.)

954
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:28,472
I think we're going to go eat soon.

955
01:00:28,472 --> 01:00:30,202
- Yes. - That sounds good.

956
01:00:30,202 --> 01:00:31,302
(Looking around)

957
01:00:32,172 --> 01:00:33,442
- What are we doing? - Tanya is hiding.

958
01:00:33,602 --> 01:00:35,372
- Really? - Bring her around.

959
01:00:35,942 --> 01:00:37,042
Who's here?

960
01:00:38,882 --> 01:00:41,082
(Kyra's mother showed up from the back.)

961
01:00:43,512 --> 01:00:44,522
(Emotional)

962
01:00:45,422 --> 01:00:46,722
Come here, baby.

963
01:00:46,982 --> 01:00:50,222
(A surprise reunion with her mom after a long time)

964
01:00:53,022 --> 01:00:56,362
Hi, my name is Tanya, and I'm Kyra's mom.

965
01:00:56,392 --> 01:00:58,632
I had already planned an overseas trip,

966
01:00:58,632 --> 01:01:02,032
and so I worked it out that I would fly here from Bangkok.

967
01:01:02,172 --> 01:01:03,572
But I told her...

968
01:01:03,572 --> 01:01:05,472
that it didn't fit into my budget.

969
01:01:06,142 --> 01:01:08,012
She wasn't expecting me to come.

970
01:01:08,312 --> 01:01:09,542
Were you surprised?

971
01:01:09,772 --> 01:01:12,082
Yes, I tapped out because she said...

972
01:01:12,082 --> 01:01:13,142
she wasn't coming.

973
01:01:13,442 --> 01:01:14,782
I knew she was shitty.

974
01:01:15,582 --> 01:01:16,752
Oh, my.

975
01:01:16,752 --> 01:01:18,682
I had to lie to my daughter, but I'm...

976
01:01:18,682 --> 01:01:20,252
It's lovely to see her. I know...

977
01:01:20,252 --> 01:01:22,092
there's a lot of pressure on all these girls...

978
01:01:22,252 --> 01:01:24,392
and just nice to be here to support them.

979
01:01:24,992 --> 01:01:26,822
- How are the kids? - Kids are good.

980
01:01:26,822 --> 01:01:28,792
- That's good. - It was hard to leave them.

981
01:01:28,792 --> 01:01:30,192
I wanted to bring them.

982
01:01:31,262 --> 01:01:32,702
Sad.

983
01:01:33,262 --> 01:01:34,402
So...

984
01:01:34,972 --> 01:01:36,632
Period.

985
01:01:36,632 --> 01:01:38,542
(She has a feeling about what her mom's surprise gift is.)

986
01:01:38,742 --> 01:01:40,812
Hi, mommy.

987
01:01:41,542 --> 01:01:43,512
Oh, man. I hate this.

988
01:01:43,512 --> 01:01:44,512
(She burst into tears upon seeing her daughter.)

989
01:01:44,512 --> 01:01:45,812
I miss you.

990
01:01:46,712 --> 01:01:48,182
And I love you.

991
01:01:48,482 --> 01:01:50,012
And now come home.

992
01:01:50,752 --> 01:01:51,852
Now come home.

993
01:01:51,852 --> 01:01:52,952
(So cute)

994
01:01:53,052 --> 01:01:54,052
(She can't miss a moment of their precious voices and faces.)

995
01:01:54,052 --> 01:01:55,052
Listen to him.

996
01:01:55,052 --> 01:01:57,722
- Mom. - He's talking.

997
01:01:57,722 --> 01:01:58,722
Let's go.

998
01:01:58,722 --> 01:02:00,962
(The children had grown a bit while they were apart.)

999
01:02:01,262 --> 01:02:03,392
(Kaea feels both sorry and proud as a mom.)

1000
01:02:04,362 --> 01:02:05,902
That's nice.

1001
01:02:06,262 --> 01:02:07,832
Thank you, Mom, for getting that.

1002
01:02:07,832 --> 01:02:09,072
I know it would've been hard to capture it...

1003
01:02:09,072 --> 01:02:10,532
- because they're very... - Very hard.

1004
01:02:11,702 --> 01:02:13,572
You did it very well.

1005
01:02:13,572 --> 01:02:16,212
I wouldn't be able to do this job without you, Mom,

1006
01:02:16,312 --> 01:02:17,942
having the kids.

1007
01:02:18,112 --> 01:02:19,112
Yes.

1008
01:02:19,112 --> 01:02:21,212
I love them more than I love these two.

1009
01:02:22,752 --> 01:02:26,552
I love them a million times more than I love them.

1010
01:02:27,352 --> 01:02:29,552
My parents sacrificed a lot and...

1011
01:02:29,552 --> 01:02:31,462
helped me pursue my dream.

1012
01:02:31,462 --> 01:02:33,862
So, it wasn't just me and my sister's journey.

1013
01:02:33,862 --> 01:02:35,562
It was my parents' journey as well.

1014
01:02:35,692 --> 01:02:38,132
- I wish I was there. - Yes.

1015
01:02:38,132 --> 01:02:41,572
All we want to do is make ourselves proud and our family proud.

1016
01:02:41,832 --> 01:02:44,742
They're who drive us to win.

1017
01:02:44,972 --> 01:02:48,172
And we truly do believe that we are going to win.

1018
01:02:49,172 --> 01:02:52,542
All in us.

1019
01:02:52,542 --> 01:02:54,752
(AG SQUAD’s last dance starts, and it'll shine brighter than ever.)

1020
01:02:55,012 --> 01:02:57,112
Please vote for them.

1021
01:02:59,052 --> 01:03:00,052
All in us.

1022
01:03:00,052 --> 01:03:01,122
(A performance that boldly revealed "our true selves," embodying...)

1023
01:03:01,122 --> 01:03:02,222
(AG SQUAD’s raw, intense energy and strategic identity)

1024
01:03:02,222 --> 01:03:03,752
AG SQUAD.

1025
01:03:07,832 --> 01:03:11,132
(And this very moment we don't break. We bite.)

1026
01:03:11,132 --> 01:03:13,962
(Born from the dark. We live for a fight.)

1027
01:03:14,272 --> 01:03:17,232
(Blood, sweat, and tears. We pay the price.)

1028
01:03:17,232 --> 01:03:21,012
(But tonight's the night. We change our lives.)

1029
01:03:21,012 --> 01:03:24,412
(OJO oh, no. MOTIV's too slow.)

1030
01:03:24,412 --> 01:03:26,942
(Watch you choke while we steal the show.)

1031
01:03:26,942 --> 01:03:29,982
(We don't fall. We don't break. We don't run.)

1032
01:03:29,982 --> 01:03:33,452
(Three teams, one stage. You know we've won.)

1033
01:03:34,322 --> 01:03:36,292
AG SQUAD.

1034
01:05:25,962 --> 01:05:27,572
Rawness, intensity,

1035
01:05:27,702 --> 01:05:30,072
and strategic identity.

1036
01:05:30,372 --> 01:05:32,842
It was AG SQUAD's Crew Identity performance...

1037
01:05:32,842 --> 01:05:34,612
that showcased all the moments...

1038
01:05:34,712 --> 01:05:37,942
that define what AG SQUAD is today.

1039
01:05:39,442 --> 01:05:41,582
Special judge, Saweetie.

1040
01:05:43,352 --> 01:05:46,322
It was AG SQUAD's Crew Identity performance.

1041
01:05:46,322 --> 01:05:47,522
How was it for you?

1042
01:05:49,252 --> 01:05:51,292
Hey, girls.

1043
01:05:54,092 --> 01:05:56,562
It's so nice to see you guys in person.

1044
01:05:56,562 --> 01:06:00,462
I mean, the identity is fierce. The identity is giving.

1045
01:06:00,462 --> 01:06:03,202
The identity is... It's just unmatchable.

1046
01:06:03,202 --> 01:06:05,172
You guys came, and you did your things.

1047
01:06:05,172 --> 01:06:08,042
The facial expressions. I don't know if I should be scared.

1048
01:06:08,042 --> 01:06:09,572
Or I don't know if I should be seduced.

1049
01:06:09,872 --> 01:06:13,212
But you got me, baby. You got me. You guys were so great tonight.

1050
01:06:13,212 --> 01:06:14,452
Congratulations.

1051
01:06:22,052 --> 01:06:24,222
Fight Judge Mike Song.

1052
01:06:24,592 --> 01:06:27,292
What did you think about AG SQUAD's stage?

1053
01:06:28,592 --> 01:06:32,602
I just have to say, AG SQUAD, you all are built...

1054
01:06:32,702 --> 01:06:35,602
for giant arenas around the world.

1055
01:06:36,002 --> 01:06:40,102
Everyone in the room can feel your energy.

1056
01:06:40,502 --> 01:06:42,642
- Everyone can feel it, right? - Yes.

1057
01:06:43,972 --> 01:06:47,682
And it's because of the power, the athleticism that you guys bring.

1058
01:06:47,682 --> 01:06:50,112
I feel like, of course, that's your guys' identity.

1059
01:06:50,112 --> 01:06:53,052
And one more aspect of your identity that I feel like you guys showed...

1060
01:06:53,252 --> 01:06:56,592
is that throughout the season, you guys keep evolving.

1061
01:06:56,592 --> 01:06:59,392
I really feel like you leveled up every episode.

1062
01:06:59,392 --> 01:07:01,632
And even here, you're still... Who was it?

1063
01:07:01,832 --> 01:07:03,662
Alysha doing the backspins.

1064
01:07:03,762 --> 01:07:07,732
Like, where did that come from? There are always these new weapons.

1065
01:07:08,672 --> 01:07:09,702
But again.

1066
01:07:09,702 --> 01:07:12,672
All of you guys are superstars, and I'm just...

1067
01:07:12,672 --> 01:07:15,642
Congratulations on killing it and showing your identity.

1068
01:07:21,252 --> 01:07:23,782
Through dancing, AG SQUAD...

1069
01:07:23,782 --> 01:07:25,682
showcased their crew's identity.

1070
01:07:26,222 --> 01:07:30,292
Leader Kaea, how do you feel now that your performance is over?

1071
01:07:31,892 --> 01:07:35,062
Hi, everybody!

1072
01:07:37,632 --> 01:07:38,702
Hello.

1073
01:07:40,562 --> 01:07:43,832
It's been such a surreal moment for us.

1074
01:07:43,832 --> 01:07:45,272
We are so blessed to be here.

1075
01:07:45,272 --> 01:07:47,872
I feel very blessed, and I'm so proud of these girls.

1076
01:07:48,172 --> 01:07:51,412
You know, they worked so hard. We worked so hard.

1077
01:07:51,512 --> 01:07:54,682
So I'm so proud of them. And I'm just so grateful to be here.

1078
01:07:54,682 --> 01:07:56,952
And my mom's here as well.

1079
01:07:59,622 --> 01:08:02,422
I love you. Don't cry.

1080
01:08:05,092 --> 01:08:06,292
Thank you, everyone.

1081
01:08:09,432 --> 01:08:11,832
Kyra of AG SQUAD.

1082
01:08:12,402 --> 01:08:16,171
Please say a word to the fans rooting for AG SQUAD.

1083
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:20,542
Hi, everyone. Hello.

1084
01:08:23,712 --> 01:08:25,381
One thing before I say something.

1085
01:08:25,381 --> 01:08:27,312
I want everyone to do it with me because...

1086
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:29,212
it's pretty cool, to be honest.

1087
01:08:29,212 --> 01:08:31,982
You know, to be from a small, little town. Country, sorry.

1088
01:08:32,381 --> 01:08:34,082
And to have us go so viral.

1089
01:08:34,452 --> 01:08:36,352
Let me get AG SQUAD on the beat, okay?

1090
01:08:36,551 --> 01:08:38,392
AG SQUAD on the beat. Go!

1091
01:08:41,992 --> 01:08:44,131
I want you to join us now. Ready?

1092
01:08:44,702 --> 01:08:47,662
Here we go. In 5, 6, 7, 8.

1093
01:08:47,662 --> 01:08:49,772
- Vote for us. - For us.

1094
01:08:50,072 --> 01:08:52,202
- Vote for us. - For us.

1095
01:08:52,402 --> 01:08:54,671
- Vote... - Vote for us.

1096
01:08:54,872 --> 01:08:57,042
- for us. - For us.

1097
01:09:00,881 --> 01:09:02,452
Sorry. I just wanted to hear everyone.

1098
01:09:02,452 --> 01:09:06,221
But, on the other hand, I do want to say...

1099
01:09:06,551 --> 01:09:10,051
a big, lot of love from AG SQUAD to our fans,

1100
01:09:10,152 --> 01:09:12,822
to our families, and to everyone who is here today.

1101
01:09:13,122 --> 01:09:16,232
Thank you for supporting us, starting from a new crew...

1102
01:09:16,332 --> 01:09:18,562
that has never danced together beside...

1103
01:09:18,761 --> 01:09:22,272
us four. We really had to evolve through the show...

1104
01:09:22,372 --> 01:09:23,932
and find our teamwork.

1105
01:09:24,332 --> 01:09:26,272
But I think it's perfectly clear that we found...

1106
01:09:26,272 --> 01:09:28,011
that teamwork throughout the show.

1107
01:09:28,542 --> 01:09:30,572
And I'm nothing but proud of these girls.

1108
01:09:30,772 --> 01:09:34,112
I'm so thankful to be on this journey with such amazing...

1109
01:09:34,112 --> 01:09:36,912
and talented dancers here on this floor with us.

1110
01:09:37,212 --> 01:09:39,022
To our fans, we love you guys so much.

1111
01:09:39,022 --> 01:09:41,122
And your love doesn't go unnoticed.

1112
01:09:41,122 --> 01:09:42,892
We're so grateful for everyone here.

1113
01:09:42,992 --> 01:09:46,062
And yes. AG ANGELS, especially,

1114
01:09:46,322 --> 01:09:48,562
you guys have had our backs through the whole thing.

1115
01:09:48,562 --> 01:09:50,732
We've got a lot from you guys out of this.

1116
01:09:51,032 --> 01:09:53,162
- Thank you. I love you. - Thank you.

1117
01:10:08,852 --> 01:10:13,082

Team US. MOTIV.

1132
01:11:31,062 --> 01:11:33,732
Throughout World of Street Woman Fighter,

1133
01:11:33,732 --> 01:11:35,272
MOTIV has shown bold moves...

1134
01:11:35,372 --> 01:11:38,142
and unique styles, leaving a great impression.

1135
01:11:38,802 --> 01:11:42,312
With Leader Marlee Hightower's detailed and witty directions,

1136
01:11:42,572 --> 01:11:46,112
each performance was fresh and flawless.

1137
01:11:46,382 --> 01:11:50,052
It made MOTIV's identity stand out more.

1138
01:11:51,422 --> 01:11:55,022
This performance is filled with pride...

1139
01:11:55,022 --> 01:11:58,362
and perfectly represents who MOTIV is.

1140
01:11:59,092 --> 01:12:00,992
The performance that showcases...

1141
01:12:00,992 --> 01:12:02,962
the crew identity they built in their own way.

1142
01:12:03,792 --> 01:12:06,002
Team USA. MOTIV.

1143
01:12:06,532 --> 01:12:08,972
Ready? Fight!

1144
01:12:16,242 --> 01:12:17,242
(The mission reveal day)

1145
01:12:17,242 --> 01:12:18,582
(The 2nd final mission is...)

1146
01:12:19,982 --> 01:12:22,082
(the Crew Identity Mission.)

1147
01:12:22,282 --> 01:12:23,512
(Come on!)

1148
01:12:23,512 --> 01:12:25,952
I'm excited for the Crew Identity Mission.

1149
01:12:26,052 --> 01:12:28,752
I want the performance to be...

1150
01:12:28,852 --> 01:12:31,662
very cool and very hip-hop again.

1151
01:12:31,662 --> 01:12:33,922
I just want people to have fun while watching it,

1152
01:12:33,922 --> 01:12:36,532
while also being thoroughly impressed.

1153
01:12:36,632 --> 01:12:38,602
I had an idea.

1154
01:12:41,502 --> 01:12:45,472
(Why is Marlee Hightower singing in a recording studio?)

1155
01:12:45,472 --> 01:12:47,272
I'm singing in the song.

1156
01:12:47,272 --> 01:12:49,212
I think it's an extra way...

1157
01:12:49,212 --> 01:12:53,042
of actually having our identity in this performance,

1158
01:12:53,042 --> 01:12:55,412
which is really exciting.

1159
01:12:55,412 --> 01:12:57,452
(The song became richer with Marlee Hightower's voice.)

1160
01:12:57,652 --> 01:13:00,882
Show our power, spirit,

1161
01:13:01,422 --> 01:13:03,622
joy, and humor.

1162
01:13:03,622 --> 01:13:06,922
We also just truly get the opportunity...

1163
01:13:06,922 --> 01:13:09,632
to show our personalities in this piece.

1164
01:13:09,792 --> 01:13:11,332
I'm really excited for this one.

1165
01:13:11,332 --> 01:13:12,462
Yes, same.

1166
01:13:12,462 --> 01:13:15,002
This song is so good. It gets me hyped.

1167
01:13:15,002 --> 01:13:16,402
- And we're having fun. - Yes.

1168
01:13:16,402 --> 01:13:17,572
Having fun is key.

1169
01:13:19,402 --> 01:13:20,742
(Oh, what's that?)

1170
01:13:21,442 --> 01:13:23,342
- What? - Like fans?

1171
01:13:23,342 --> 01:13:24,472
From the US?

1172
01:13:26,182 --> 01:13:27,682
(The MOTIV members in the US make a surprise appearance.)

1173
01:13:28,352 --> 01:13:30,652
(Who's this?)

1174
01:13:30,652 --> 01:13:32,752
MOTIV to MOTIV.

1175
01:13:33,352 --> 01:13:35,222
Oh, my gosh.

1176
01:13:35,322 --> 01:13:37,652
And it's beautiful to see you represented...

1177
01:13:37,752 --> 01:13:41,192
because you all deserve it. We really miss you. Keep working hard.

1178
01:13:41,192 --> 01:13:43,832
We're holding it down until you all come back with a win.

1179
01:13:43,962 --> 01:13:46,102
(We miss you, our friends!)

1180
01:13:46,102 --> 01:13:48,572
We love you. Bye, MOTIV!

1181
01:13:48,572 --> 01:13:49,732
Yes, sir!

1182
01:13:52,472 --> 01:13:54,672
Hey, Nyssa. It's Mom.

1183
01:13:55,312 --> 01:13:57,842
(Mom)

1184
01:13:58,042 --> 01:14:00,782
I love watching you dance on TV,

1185
01:14:00,782 --> 01:14:04,482
living your dream, and working so hard.

1186
01:14:05,052 --> 01:14:07,882
Hi, Logan. I miss you, and I love you so much.

1187
01:14:11,562 --> 01:14:13,392
I'm sorry about my voice.

1188
01:14:13,392 --> 01:14:14,862
I hope you can understand me.

1189
01:14:15,062 --> 01:14:19,232
(She can't stop crying, thinking about her unwell mom.)

1190
01:14:19,532 --> 01:14:21,502
I know that the last few weeks...

1191
01:14:21,502 --> 01:14:24,132
have been physically and mentally challenging for you.

1192
01:14:24,432 --> 01:14:26,142
There's been a lot of struggle.

1193
01:14:26,242 --> 01:14:28,912
Just continue to support and be kind to one another.

1194
01:14:29,672 --> 01:14:31,512
Hey, guys. It's your manager here.

1195
01:14:31,512 --> 01:14:32,612
(Marlee Hightower's mom was with MOTIV throughout the journey.)

1196
01:14:32,612 --> 01:14:34,742
Watching you guys every week,

1197
01:14:34,742 --> 01:14:36,512
rise to every challenge,

1198
01:14:36,512 --> 01:14:40,282
and grow your capacity has been my life's honor.

1199
01:14:40,582 --> 01:14:41,622
And Marlee Hightower.

1200
01:14:42,722 --> 01:14:44,722
I'm so proud of you as your mom.

1201
01:14:44,722 --> 01:14:46,692
You are such a light.

1202
01:14:47,092 --> 01:14:48,932
You make me want to be better.

1203
01:14:50,562 --> 01:14:52,232
I love you so much.

1204
01:14:52,932 --> 01:14:56,232
May god bless you, and may god bless your MOTIV team.

1205
01:14:56,832 --> 01:14:58,142
- I love you, baby. - Bye.

1206
01:14:58,942 --> 01:15:00,542
Oh, my gosh.

1207
01:15:01,842 --> 01:15:04,312
You're amazing and you've got this.

1208
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:06,212
- We love you. - We love you.

1209
01:15:09,612 --> 01:15:10,782
(Bella Olsen's niece)

1210
01:15:10,782 --> 01:15:12,982
What's your MOTIV?

1211
01:15:15,622 --> 01:15:17,222
Hey, I'm cheering you on.

1212
01:15:17,222 --> 01:15:19,192
Keep fighting, and I love you.

1213
01:15:20,462 --> 01:15:22,492
I love you so much.

1214
01:15:22,492 --> 01:15:24,362
I can't wait for you to come home.

1215
01:15:24,362 --> 01:15:26,562
We can celebrate your big win.

1216
01:15:26,562 --> 01:15:28,732
- Go, MOTIV! - Go, MOTIV!

1217
01:15:28,832 --> 01:15:29,832
What you got?

1218
01:15:29,832 --> 01:15:32,972
- What you got? What's your MOTIV? - What you got? What's your MOTIV?

1219
01:15:34,102 --> 01:15:35,972
Oh, my gosh.

1220
01:15:37,242 --> 01:15:43,182
(The letters from abroad have made the MOTIV members cry buckets.)

1221
01:15:43,382 --> 01:15:47,082
Our reminder of why we do what we do.

1222
01:15:47,082 --> 01:15:50,892
Basically, what we came here for was to show who we are.

1223
01:15:50,892 --> 01:15:54,492
And this Crew Identity Mission is exactly what we're going to do.

1224
01:15:55,062 --> 01:15:56,332
All of our power.

1225
01:15:56,432 --> 01:15:57,792
- So let's do this! - Our power!

1226
01:15:57,792 --> 01:16:00,002
- Our power! - Our power!

1227
01:16:00,102 --> 01:16:01,232
Let's do it!

1228
01:16:01,772 --> 01:16:03,732
It's the final. Let's go!

1229
01:16:08,672 --> 01:16:10,112
(A performance showcasing MOTIV's raw energy,)

1230
01:16:10,112 --> 01:16:11,472
(unique style, groove, and precision in their fundamentals...)

1231
01:16:11,472 --> 01:16:12,942
(all set to a track featuring Marlee Hightower's voice)

1232
01:18:18,772 --> 01:18:20,642
Let's go.

1233
01:18:40,692 --> 01:18:44,292
Over a track layered with leader Marlee’s vocals,

1234
01:18:44,292 --> 01:18:47,432
MOTIV delivered their raw energy, unique style,

1235
01:18:47,432 --> 01:18:49,702
and even the finesse within their groove.

1236
01:18:49,702 --> 01:18:53,372
This stage captured MOTIV’s identity in full.

1237
01:18:55,142 --> 01:18:57,742
Special Judge Aliya Janell.

1238
01:18:58,242 --> 01:18:59,342
What did you think of...

1239
01:18:59,342 --> 01:19:02,152
MOTIV's Crew Identity Mission performance?

1240
01:19:02,412 --> 01:19:05,122
I got a couple of things. Number one,

1241
01:19:05,122 --> 01:19:08,822
I am going to take back wearing sweats with these baggy shorts.

1242
01:19:08,822 --> 01:19:11,152
I'm going to take back to LA. Thank you very much.

1243
01:19:12,392 --> 01:19:15,132
When you all came out, I wanted to be in an old school Cadillac.

1244
01:19:15,132 --> 01:19:17,232
With like Snoop in my passenger seat.

1245
01:19:17,232 --> 01:19:19,362
I just wanted like the hydraulics to ride.

1246
01:19:19,362 --> 01:19:20,532
You know what I'm saying?

1247
01:19:20,832 --> 01:19:24,802
The second thing is, a bass will hate to see MOTIV coming.

1248
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:26,842
Bass!

1249
01:19:30,272 --> 01:19:33,042
You guys. They do not let a bass go by,

1250
01:19:33,042 --> 01:19:36,052
and I love that because your musicality is like...

1251
01:19:36,752 --> 01:19:37,912
It's so ill.

1252
01:19:37,912 --> 01:19:41,122
The music is coming out of them. You know what I mean?

1253
01:19:41,282 --> 01:19:43,292
Their movement is creating the music.

1254
01:19:43,292 --> 01:19:47,122
And that's what makes a fantastic and incredible artist.

1255
01:19:47,962 --> 01:19:49,992
Your grooves are everything.

1256
01:19:49,992 --> 01:19:52,832
I lose my voice every time I watch you guys,

1257
01:19:52,832 --> 01:19:53,862
because I'm just screaming.

1258
01:19:53,862 --> 01:19:56,632
I'm out of this seat, messing up my outfit and so on.

1259
01:19:56,632 --> 01:19:58,742
But you know, you guys are so worth it.

1260
01:19:58,742 --> 01:20:01,542
I love that you guys are here. Congratulations.

1261
01:20:01,542 --> 01:20:02,942
I love you all, MOTIV.

1262
01:20:03,072 --> 01:20:04,172
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1263
01:20:06,842 --> 01:20:08,282
I thought we did good.

1264
01:20:08,512 --> 01:20:10,782
Fight Judge Mike Song,

1265
01:20:11,152 --> 01:20:13,682
what did you think of MOTIV's performance?

1266
01:20:15,322 --> 01:20:16,692
I mean you know I loved it.

1267
01:20:16,692 --> 01:20:19,022
You know how I feel about you all.

1268
01:20:20,492 --> 01:20:23,732
All I have to say for everybody watching at home...

1269
01:20:24,732 --> 01:20:28,832
MOTIV. The skill level is so high.

1270
01:20:29,032 --> 01:20:30,102
Do you get it?

1271
01:20:30,302 --> 01:20:31,942
It's like...

1272
01:20:31,942 --> 01:20:35,212
It's because they dance relaxedly,

1273
01:20:35,612 --> 01:20:37,172
but they are also super technical.

1274
01:20:37,412 --> 01:20:41,012
And then you go from super technical, super precise,

1275
01:20:41,012 --> 01:20:43,852
and then the contrast to just chill.

1276
01:20:43,852 --> 01:20:46,652
And back to the head.

1277
01:20:46,652 --> 01:20:51,092
It's so technical. It's such a high skill level.

1278
01:20:51,092 --> 01:20:52,722
It's mad respect.

1279
01:20:52,722 --> 01:20:55,492
It's also the momentum of your performances...

1280
01:20:55,492 --> 01:20:58,232
are always so carefully constructed...

1281
01:20:58,232 --> 01:21:01,662
so that the feeling that you get comes from experience.

1282
01:21:01,662 --> 01:21:03,672
I see it, and I respect it.

1283
01:21:03,972 --> 01:21:04,972
Much love.

1284
01:21:05,942 --> 01:21:07,002
Thank you, Mike.

1285
01:21:09,542 --> 01:21:13,312
Through dance, MOTIV proved their crew identity.

1286
01:21:13,912 --> 01:21:17,682
Leader Marlee, how do you feel now that you're done performing?

1287
01:21:18,782 --> 01:21:20,322
I feel incredible.

1288
01:21:20,322 --> 01:21:22,422
I feel like we absolutely killed it.

1289
01:21:22,422 --> 01:21:26,462
We left absolutely everything out on the dance floor.

1290
01:21:26,462 --> 01:21:30,592
And you know, for us, MOTIV, and showcasing our identity...

1291
01:21:30,592 --> 01:21:33,432
isn't just about showcasing our identity on the show.

1292
01:21:33,432 --> 01:21:36,702
It's about furthering the legacy that we are creating.

1293
01:21:36,702 --> 01:21:39,642
We didn't come together just for the sake of the show.

1294
01:21:39,642 --> 01:21:42,912
I've been running MOTIV for almost a decade now.

1295
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:45,412
And we will continue to run after this.

1296
01:21:45,412 --> 01:21:47,982
So this means the world to have this platform.

1297
01:21:47,982 --> 01:21:50,012
I just feel so grateful. Thank you, guys.

1298
01:21:50,012 --> 01:21:51,012
Thank you.

1299
01:21:55,892 --> 01:21:58,252
Next, MOTIV's Fantaye?

1300
01:22:01,562 --> 01:22:05,192
Can you say something to the fans cheering for MOTIV?

1301
01:22:06,332 --> 01:22:07,732
What's up?

1302
01:22:07,732 --> 01:22:11,132
I really just want to say thank you so much for all the support.

1303
01:22:11,132 --> 01:22:13,902
Dancers in the US don't receive this much..

1304
01:22:13,902 --> 01:22:17,612
attention and support and energy behind our artistry.

1305
01:22:17,612 --> 01:22:19,682
I am especially grateful...

1306
01:22:19,682 --> 01:22:22,482
that you guys care about us as people and as humans first.

1307
01:22:22,482 --> 01:22:24,652
I don't feel like our dance is the thing that resonates with you,

1308
01:22:24,652 --> 01:22:26,622
but our humanities is the thing that resonates with you.

1309
01:22:26,622 --> 01:22:30,252
Our dance is on top of that, so thank you.

1310
01:22:37,162 --> 01:22:41,202
MOTIV completed their Crew Identity Mission performance.

1311
01:22:41,202 --> 01:22:44,532
If you want to give them the winner's trophy,

1312
01:22:44,532 --> 01:22:45,872
show us your support for MOTIV...

1313
01:22:45,872 --> 01:22:51,742
through the Real-Time Global Online Voting and Real-Time Text Voting.

1314
01:22:52,612 --> 01:22:54,882
The Real-Time Global Online Voting is being carried out...

1315
01:22:54,882 --> 01:22:57,682
in the Mnet Plus app.

1316
01:22:57,682 --> 01:22:59,482
And you can participate in the Real-Time Text Voting...

1317
01:22:59,482 --> 01:23:05,722
and send a text with MOTIV or the number 2 to 0011.

1318
01:23:11,332 --> 01:23:14,562
That was MOTIV. Well done, everyone.

1319
01:23:15,372 --> 01:23:17,532
- I love you! - Go, MOTIV!

1320
01:23:17,532 --> 01:23:21,402
I love you!

1321
01:23:33,322 --> 01:23:37,622
Which crew is going to be the final winner that will seize...

1322
01:23:37,622 --> 01:23:40,392
the Global Champion Trophy tonight?

1323
01:23:41,662 --> 01:23:45,432
Your choice can change the final result,

1324
01:23:45,432 --> 01:23:49,032
so please vote for the crew you are rooting for.

1325
01:23:53,802 --> 01:23:56,142
The last crew going up the stage is...

1326
01:23:58,542 --> 01:24:01,912
Team Japan, OSAKA Ojo Gang.

1327
01:24:08,582 --> 01:24:12,092
OSAKA Ojo Gang is comprised of the greatest battlers,

1328
01:24:12,092 --> 01:24:13,692
but they faced a crisis...

1329
01:24:13,692 --> 01:24:15,732
as they went to the first elimination battle.

1330
01:24:16,162 --> 01:24:19,502
But with every stage that followed, they gained momentum...

1331
01:24:19,502 --> 01:24:21,302
and turned the tables.

1332
01:24:21,302 --> 01:24:24,032
In the semi-final Dance Film Mission,

1333
01:24:24,032 --> 01:24:26,742
they ranked first place in the global public vote...

1334
01:24:26,742 --> 01:24:28,502
and claimed the main section.

1335
01:24:30,772 --> 01:24:34,342
They said this performance captures every moment...

1336
01:24:34,342 --> 01:24:38,052
that made OSAKA Ojo Gang who they are today.

1337
01:24:38,822 --> 01:24:41,082
Expect a stage packed with charisma and energy.

1338
01:24:41,082 --> 01:24:44,092
OSAKA Ojo Gang's Crew Identity Mission Performance...

1339
01:24:44,092 --> 01:24:46,522
will start now.

1340
01:24:48,892 --> 01:24:51,762
Team Japan, OSAKA Ojo Gang.

1341
01:24:52,062 --> 01:24:53,062
Ready.

1342
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:54,632
Fight!

1343
01:25:01,302 --> 01:25:02,312
Hello.

1344
01:25:02,872 --> 01:25:03,872
Thank you for your help.

1345
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:05,012
It's the finals now,

1346
01:25:05,012 --> 01:25:07,582
so the song is very important.

1347
01:25:07,582 --> 01:25:09,852
If a track doesn’t have power...

1348
01:25:09,852 --> 01:25:12,522
or doesn’t have a memorable hook...

1349
01:25:12,522 --> 01:25:15,382
or an image that sticks to your head,

1350
01:25:15,382 --> 01:25:17,222
then in my opinion, it’s already lost.

1351
01:25:17,222 --> 01:25:19,822
We want to make this song really strong.

1352
01:25:19,822 --> 01:25:21,992
And we want to keep it...

1353
01:25:21,992 --> 01:25:24,432
not going too far from street dance.

1354
01:25:24,432 --> 01:25:25,802
We have the example music.

1355
01:25:26,202 --> 01:25:28,262
(Focusing)

1356
01:25:28,532 --> 01:25:31,572
Since it’s the finals, we have really thought it through...

1357
01:25:31,572 --> 01:25:34,342
and given it everything so we can show you...

1358
01:25:34,342 --> 01:25:36,372
the OSAKA Ojo Gang that truly fits this track.

1359
01:25:36,512 --> 01:25:37,872
- Let's do a replay. - Okay.

1360
01:25:38,842 --> 01:25:41,082
- Are we a little out of formation? - I'll do it.

1361
01:25:41,082 --> 01:25:42,512
Can we do it one more time?

1362
01:25:44,312 --> 01:25:45,482
(While filming their Final Crew Cheer Theme video,)

1363
01:25:45,482 --> 01:25:46,622
(they monitored their performance as always.)

1364
01:25:47,122 --> 01:25:49,452
Hello, Ibuki.

1365
01:25:49,452 --> 01:25:50,452
What?

1366
01:25:51,192 --> 01:25:52,862
(A familiar face pops up on the screen.)

1367
01:25:52,962 --> 01:25:56,532
Ibuki. Hello, it's Junna.

1368
01:25:56,662 --> 01:26:00,232
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's letter to their leader Ibuki)

1369
01:26:00,532 --> 01:26:02,472
What?

1370
01:26:04,472 --> 01:26:09,442
We want to thank you, Ibuki, OSAKA Ojo Gang's leader.

1371
01:26:09,442 --> 01:26:10,442
It's Minami.

1372
01:26:10,442 --> 01:26:11,712
Hello.

1373
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:13,482
- It's me, Hana. - It's Uwa.

1374
01:26:13,812 --> 01:26:15,482
Yes. It's Kyoka.

1375
01:26:15,582 --> 01:26:16,952
(Gosh, these people.)

1376
01:26:17,082 --> 01:26:21,182
I got to join OSAKA Ojo Gang...

1377
01:26:21,182 --> 01:26:22,792
thanks to Ibuki.

1378
01:26:22,792 --> 01:26:25,452
I'm fascinated to be working with people...

1379
01:26:25,452 --> 01:26:28,962
I have never crossed paths with before.

1380
01:26:28,962 --> 01:26:31,792
I am very grateful to her.

1381
01:26:32,062 --> 01:26:33,502
(Ibuki is proud.)

1382
01:26:33,502 --> 01:26:35,932
Hello, it's Junna.

1383
01:26:36,172 --> 01:26:37,602
Junna!

1384
01:26:37,772 --> 01:26:39,242
(Shy)

1385
01:26:40,042 --> 01:26:42,612
Ibuki is...

1386
01:26:42,942 --> 01:26:44,942
such a strong woman.

1387
01:26:44,942 --> 01:26:47,812
So whatever the challenge,

1388
01:26:47,812 --> 01:26:51,682
she makes everyone grow and reach for a higher place.

1389
01:26:51,682 --> 01:26:53,352
That's the kind of leader she is.

1390
01:26:53,482 --> 01:26:56,952
There were many tough moments while being on the show.

1391
01:26:56,952 --> 01:26:58,752
But she always showed up with bright energy...

1392
01:26:58,752 --> 01:27:01,592
and carried this vibe that made everyone energetic.

1393
01:27:01,592 --> 01:27:03,932
Thanks to Ibuki moving in various directions,

1394
01:27:03,932 --> 01:27:06,202
we were able to come this far.

1395
01:27:06,202 --> 01:27:08,732
I've known Ibuki for over ten years now.

1396
01:27:08,732 --> 01:27:11,632
I'm very happy to be able to battle again with her.

1397
01:27:11,632 --> 01:27:14,772
She's always focused forward, driven by a strong will to win.

1398
01:27:14,772 --> 01:27:18,812
She's never stirred, and I have the highest respect for her.

1399
01:27:18,812 --> 01:27:22,212
Thanks to OSAKA Ojo Gang, I had the best time.

1400
01:27:22,212 --> 01:27:25,082
This is the 11th take.

1401
01:27:25,082 --> 01:27:26,622
(It's the eleventh take! Goodness.)

1402
01:27:26,622 --> 01:27:29,322
First, she's always cheerful.

1403
01:27:29,322 --> 01:27:31,392
She's kind. She's cool.

1404
01:27:31,392 --> 01:27:32,962
She's our queen.

1405
01:27:32,962 --> 01:27:34,222
I love Ibuki.

1406
01:27:34,662 --> 01:27:36,492
(Which member will share her feelings for Ibuki last?)

1407
01:27:36,632 --> 01:27:38,392
You were waiting for me, weren't you?

1408
01:27:38,732 --> 01:27:41,032
(I waited for you.)

1409
01:27:41,132 --> 01:27:46,772
I know how hard we worked to get this far.

1410
01:27:46,772 --> 01:27:49,642
Watching you from the side, I could feel how much...

1411
01:27:49,642 --> 01:27:52,382
pressure you were feeling as the leader.

1412
01:27:52,382 --> 01:27:57,152
You carried a lot more than the others.

1413
01:27:57,152 --> 01:27:58,382
For that reason,

1414
01:27:58,382 --> 01:28:01,382
I wanted to be of some help to you,

1415
01:28:01,382 --> 01:28:03,652
so I did some things on my own.

1416
01:28:04,322 --> 01:28:05,522
I wonder if that helped.

1417
01:28:05,522 --> 01:28:06,522
It helped, didn't it?

1418
01:28:06,962 --> 01:28:08,262
I'm sure it did.

1419
01:28:08,722 --> 01:28:10,392
It helped greatly.

1420
01:28:11,132 --> 01:28:13,162
Thank you always.

1421
01:28:13,162 --> 01:28:15,502
Please continue to be the great leader.

1422
01:28:15,502 --> 01:28:17,272
I love you, Leader.

1423
01:28:17,432 --> 01:28:18,672
I love you!

1424
01:28:18,772 --> 01:28:21,572
Please keep up the good work. Love you!

1425
01:28:22,202 --> 01:28:24,572
This is the last of the last battle.

1426
01:28:24,572 --> 01:28:26,212
Winning is the only thing left for us.

1427
01:28:26,212 --> 01:28:29,582
We will make sure to show OSAKA Ojo Gang's color.

1428
01:28:29,582 --> 01:28:31,012
(We will show you in the Crew Identity Mission.)

1429
01:28:31,012 --> 01:28:33,552
Ever since the day we came to World of Street Woman Fighter,

1430
01:28:33,552 --> 01:28:34,852
we've only had one goal.

1431
01:28:34,852 --> 01:28:37,552
- OSAKA Ojo Gang! - We will win, no matter what.

1432
01:28:40,322 --> 01:28:42,932
Gang's spirit. Queen's move.

1433
01:28:43,492 --> 01:28:45,132
OSAKA Ojo Gang.

1434
01:30:57,662 --> 01:30:59,402
Boldness, fierce ambition,

1435
01:30:59,402 --> 01:31:01,462
and graceful charisma.

1436
01:31:01,832 --> 01:31:05,172
United by OSAKA Ojo Gang's realness, the members came together...

1437
01:31:05,502 --> 01:31:08,772
to unleash their unique identity and energy.

1438
01:31:08,772 --> 01:31:11,512
It was a powerful Crew Identity Mission stage by OSAKA Ojo Gang.

1439
01:31:13,342 --> 01:31:15,782
Special Judge Aliya Janell.

1440
01:31:15,782 --> 01:31:17,352
What did you think of OSAKA Ojo Gang's...

1441
01:31:17,352 --> 01:31:20,222
Crew Identity Mission stage?

1442
01:31:20,422 --> 01:31:22,952
OSAKA Ojo Gang, I am so proud of you guys.

1443
01:31:22,952 --> 01:31:24,922
Park Jin Young and I were just talking about...

1444
01:31:24,922 --> 01:31:29,532
how you guys were a little rocky at the beginning of the show.

1445
01:31:29,532 --> 01:31:31,232
The first episode and all of the battles.

1446
01:31:31,232 --> 01:31:34,232
Then, I went home back to LA, and I was watching you guys.

1447
01:31:34,232 --> 01:31:35,972
And I was like, "Is this the same crew?"

1448
01:31:36,302 --> 01:31:38,572
You guys are not the same crew at all.

1449
01:31:38,572 --> 01:31:40,942
You guys have grown exponentially.

1450
01:31:41,042 --> 01:31:44,912
And it was really inspiring to see you guys start there...

1451
01:31:44,912 --> 01:31:47,212
and not let that define your journey...

1452
01:31:47,212 --> 01:31:49,282
or what you want this experience to be.

1453
01:31:49,282 --> 01:31:51,452
You guys worked really hard, and you guys persevered.

1454
01:31:51,452 --> 01:31:54,482
So I'm so proud of you guys. Thank you for that performance.

1455
01:31:54,482 --> 01:31:56,792
I was out of my seat. Okay?

1456
01:31:56,792 --> 01:31:58,552
Thank you so much. So good.

1457
01:32:02,122 --> 01:32:04,362
Next, Fight Judge Park Jin Young.

1458
01:32:04,932 --> 01:32:07,832
What did you think of OSAKA Ojo Gang's performance?

1459
01:32:09,672 --> 01:32:13,602
Watching all the other performances, I was just thrilled.

1460
01:32:15,172 --> 01:32:17,812
But watching them, I didn't feel thrilled.

1461
01:32:17,812 --> 01:32:18,872
And it was because...

1462
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:20,882
I was so touched.

1463
01:32:25,352 --> 01:32:27,752
Honestly, I didn't think...

1464
01:32:28,482 --> 01:32:30,552
OSAKA Ojo Gang would come this far.

1465
01:32:30,692 --> 01:32:34,662
This is why. Each member is so different.

1466
01:32:35,062 --> 01:32:39,132
I worried if they'd be able to merge as a team.

1467
01:32:40,632 --> 01:32:43,672
Here's what's touching. Each of them remained unique.

1468
01:32:43,672 --> 01:32:44,732
That's not gone.

1469
01:32:44,732 --> 01:32:46,572
But they now appear as one team.

1470
01:32:50,142 --> 01:32:51,812
That's what got me thinking.

1471
01:32:52,812 --> 01:32:55,142
Is that what people from Osaka are like?

1472
01:32:55,142 --> 01:32:56,912
They never give up.

1473
01:32:57,812 --> 01:33:00,852
They become one while still being unique.

1474
01:33:02,952 --> 01:33:04,692
It didn't seem like just a dance performance.

1475
01:33:04,752 --> 01:33:08,662
The dance, fashion, hairstyle, manner of speech,

1476
01:33:08,662 --> 01:33:10,162
and facial expression all came together.

1477
01:33:10,532 --> 01:33:12,962
And it made me wonder if that's what Osaka is really like.

1478
01:33:13,232 --> 01:33:14,832
That's how I saw it.

1479
01:33:14,832 --> 01:33:16,572
It was very moving.

1480
01:33:17,372 --> 01:33:19,702
OSAKA Ojo Gang, I think...

1481
01:33:20,972 --> 01:33:24,642
you truly represented Osaka to the world.

1482
01:33:25,142 --> 01:33:26,412
It was deeply moving.

1483
01:33:26,412 --> 01:33:27,782
Thank you.

1484
01:33:28,612 --> 01:33:32,582
Through this season, I really felt Osaka itself,

1485
01:33:32,582 --> 01:33:36,592
its spirit, and its culture coming through.

1486
01:33:36,592 --> 01:33:39,262
Even people who knew little about Osaka...

1487
01:33:39,262 --> 01:33:44,062
would have learned the vibe and culture of Osaka.

1488
01:33:44,162 --> 01:33:46,932
It was more than dance. I really enjoyed it.

1489
01:33:51,932 --> 01:33:54,502
OSAKA Ojo Gang proved their identity...

1490
01:33:54,502 --> 01:33:56,312
through the Crew Identity Mission stage.

1491
01:33:57,042 --> 01:33:58,242
Leader Ibuki.

1492
01:33:58,772 --> 01:34:01,112
How do you feel now that it's over?

1493
01:34:01,612 --> 01:34:04,082
Yes. That was so much fun.

1494
01:34:04,182 --> 01:34:07,422
That was incredible, right?

1495
01:34:07,422 --> 01:34:10,422
This mission was all about our crew identity,

1496
01:34:10,422 --> 01:34:11,692
so we wanted to create something...

1497
01:34:11,692 --> 01:34:14,022
that highlighted each member’s strengths,

1498
01:34:14,022 --> 01:34:15,122
without overdoing it.

1499
01:34:15,122 --> 01:34:19,762
To us, every single member is a superhero, like the Avengers.

1500
01:34:19,762 --> 01:34:22,132
So we built this piece just as it is...

1501
01:34:22,132 --> 01:34:25,932
to show exactly the side of us we wanted to express.

1502
01:34:25,932 --> 01:34:28,242
Standing on this stage with joy,

1503
01:34:28,242 --> 01:34:31,312
giving everything we had in the final,

1504
01:34:31,312 --> 01:34:33,082
and wrapping it up with a sense of fulfillment...

1505
01:34:33,082 --> 01:34:34,742
It has all just been so good.

1506
01:34:34,742 --> 01:34:39,582
Thank you to the members, Midoris, and everyone who took part in this.

1507
01:34:39,582 --> 01:34:40,622
Thank you.

1508
01:34:44,722 --> 01:34:47,122
Kyoka of OSAKA Ojo Gang.

1509
01:34:49,632 --> 01:34:52,292
Please say something to the fans...

1510
01:34:52,292 --> 01:34:54,202
cheering for OSAKA Ojo Gang.

1511
01:34:54,802 --> 01:34:59,742
What we've gained most from World of Street Woman Fighter...

1512
01:34:59,742 --> 01:35:01,802
is our Midoris.

1513
01:35:01,902 --> 01:35:06,312
Yes. Without you, we couldn't have made it this far.

1514
01:35:06,612 --> 01:35:10,282
We’ve come all this way together down this champion's road,

1515
01:35:10,282 --> 01:35:12,482
so please lend us your strength one more time...

1516
01:35:12,482 --> 01:35:15,052
so we can cross the finish line in the best way possible.

1517
01:35:15,052 --> 01:35:17,252
- Please vote for us. - Please vote for us.

1518
01:35:21,992 --> 01:35:26,262
That was OSAKA Ojo Gang's Crew Identity Mission performance.

1519
01:35:26,602 --> 01:35:29,772

1520

Thank you, everyone.

1528
01:36:12,982 --> 01:36:14,082

1529
01:36:14,212 --> 01:36:17,212
the final winner that will seize...

1530
01:36:17,212 --> 01:36:19,582

01:36:35,732 --> 01:36:37,332

1535
01:36:37,432 --> 01:36:40,972
the Crew Identity Mission is over.

Team USA, MOTIV.

1541
01:37:04,392 --> 01:37:06,662
Team Japan, OSAKA Ojo Gang.

1542
01:37:11,132 --> 01:37:14,042
With passionate support pouring in from around the world,

1543
01:37:14,372 --> 01:37:17,612
the rankings among the three crews are neck and neck.

1544
01:37:18,512 --> 01:37:22,312

the most world-class performance.

1550
01:37:46,972 --> 01:37:49,342
Now, only one thing remains.

1551
01:37:49,972 --> 01:37:54,682
The World Finale with JYP stage, where bonus points are on the line.

1552
01:37:58,452 --> 01:38:02,252
This is the final performance that will close out...

1553
01:38:02,352 --> 01:38:06,892
World of Street Woman Fighter with Fight Judge Park Jin Young.

1554
01:38:06,992 --> 01:38:11,462
It’s a crucial stage that can add bonus points to the final score.

1555
01:38:12,292 --> 01:38:14,862
Out of the choreographies created by the three crews,

1556
01:38:15,062 --> 01:38:17,502
only one will be chosen...

1557
01:38:17,602 --> 01:38:21,642
to own the finale stage and take the bonus points.

1558
01:38:24,172 --> 01:38:26,812
And once this stage ends,

1559
01:38:26,912 --> 01:38:29,382
the real-time votings will end as well.

1560
01:38:30,452 --> 01:38:32,612
We're just one step away from finding out...

1561
01:38:32,712 --> 01:38:35,782
who takes the crown.

1562
01:38:37,252 --> 01:38:40,722
So be sure to cast your vote for your favorite crew...

1563
01:38:40,922 --> 01:38:43,892
before the World Finale with JYP is over.

1564
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:48,132
It’s the World of Street Woman Fighter finale,

1565
01:38:48,132 --> 01:38:49,162
and the world is watching.

1566
01:38:49,972 --> 01:38:53,572
Which crew will take the bonus points?

1567
01:38:54,472 --> 01:38:56,572
Let’s find out now.

1568
01:38:57,072 --> 01:38:59,582
Ready. Fight!

1569
01:39:14,662 --> 01:39:17,162
(A global dance battle...)

1570
01:39:17,162 --> 01:39:19,762
(where their national pride is on the line.)

1571
01:39:19,962 --> 01:39:21,962
(This is the final story.)

1572
01:39:24,972 --> 01:39:27,742
- JYP Mission. - What?

1573
01:39:27,742 --> 01:39:31,012
JYP Mission!

1574
01:39:31,612 --> 01:39:32,912
(Fight Judge Park Jin Young)

1575
01:39:35,042 --> 01:39:37,882
- JYP! - I like him.

1576
01:39:37,882 --> 01:39:40,982
He's big in the K-pop industry.

1577
01:39:41,252 --> 01:39:42,282
Park Jin Young!

1578
01:39:42,852 --> 01:39:43,892
Exciting.

1579
01:39:44,692 --> 01:39:47,092
I'm happy and honored...

1580
01:39:47,092 --> 01:39:49,192
to be joining you...

1581
01:39:49,522 --> 01:39:51,832
for one of the final missions.

1582
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:54,232
- He's great. - JYP!

1583
01:39:55,002 --> 01:39:56,062
Period.

1584
01:39:56,162 --> 01:40:00,002
I will make and sing the music...

1585
01:40:00,102 --> 01:40:03,712
you can use for your mission.

1586
01:40:03,812 --> 01:40:05,042
Are you going to sing?

1587
01:40:05,042 --> 01:40:06,482
(Judge Park Jin Young's surprise gift)

1588
01:40:06,482 --> 01:40:07,812
- Period. - Let's get it.

1589
01:40:07,812 --> 01:40:10,482
I want you to be the stars.

1590
01:40:10,752 --> 01:40:12,382
Dancers are always in the background.

1591
01:40:12,382 --> 01:40:14,182
So if I get to express myself?

1592
01:40:14,182 --> 01:40:16,422
That was amazing, and I'm grateful for that.

1593
01:40:16,752 --> 01:40:18,492
I want to make the most out of it.

1594
01:40:18,692 --> 01:40:22,862
I will show you a photo that inspired me to make this song.

1595
01:40:23,292 --> 01:40:24,792
(Ta-da)

1596
01:40:25,062 --> 01:40:26,062
(What is...)

1597
01:40:26,062 --> 01:40:27,602
(that?)

1598
01:40:28,462 --> 01:40:30,972
(The fight zone turns into total chaos over a single picture.)

1599
01:40:30,972 --> 01:40:32,202
(Embarrassed)

1600
01:40:32,202 --> 01:40:33,842
- The Great Gatsby? - Wait.

1601
01:40:33,842 --> 01:40:35,272
You better be him.

1602
01:40:35,272 --> 01:40:37,572
Okay, Leonardo DiCaprio.

1603
01:40:38,172 --> 01:40:39,312
It's him.

1604
01:40:39,312 --> 01:40:40,342
(Relax.)

1605
01:40:40,342 --> 01:40:41,682
Is he saying he's Leonardo DiCaprio?

1606
01:40:42,682 --> 01:40:45,152
Okay, Leonardo DiCaprio.

1607
01:40:45,152 --> 01:40:46,622
- I love it so much. - I don't know about that.

1608
01:40:46,922 --> 01:40:50,352
- You better watch! - You better!

1609
01:40:56,022 --> 01:40:57,132
Oh, the lights!

1610
01:40:57,132 --> 01:40:58,332
(It's already exciting.)

1611
01:40:58,332 --> 01:40:59,862
- Let's go! - Okay.

1612
01:41:01,462 --> 01:41:03,902
It makes me feel good.

1613
01:41:04,232 --> 01:41:05,772
(We need to get up for this.)

1614
01:41:05,772 --> 01:41:08,002
- It's so catchy. - I'm so excited.

1615
01:41:08,502 --> 01:41:09,712
Ready!

1616
01:41:10,042 --> 01:41:12,242
I want World of Street Woman Fighter...

1617
01:41:12,242 --> 01:41:15,842
to become one beautiful festival.

1618
01:41:16,242 --> 01:41:19,882
And you are the stars of the party, the ones who make it shine.

1619
01:41:20,722 --> 01:41:22,782
(It's our song.)

1620
01:41:22,882 --> 01:41:24,822
I brought a prop I want you to...

1621
01:41:25,152 --> 01:41:28,792
keep in mind as you choreograph.

1622
01:41:28,792 --> 01:41:31,262
- Wait. What? - Is it a mic?

1623
01:41:31,362 --> 01:41:32,962
Okay. All right.

1624
01:41:33,732 --> 01:41:35,162
We can incorporate that.

1625
01:41:35,462 --> 01:41:39,132
And the crew whose choreography gets chosen...

1626
01:41:39,372 --> 01:41:42,572
will be performing together on the final stage...

1627
01:41:42,672 --> 01:41:44,242
as the main dance team.

1628
01:41:44,512 --> 01:41:48,082
So we have to learn somebody's or they have to learn ours.

1629
01:41:48,782 --> 01:41:49,812
Okay.

1630
01:41:50,512 --> 01:41:54,052
I will wait for the choreography...

1631
01:41:54,252 --> 01:41:56,382
that combines your unique styles.

1632
01:41:56,592 --> 01:41:57,992
I wish we had suits.

1633
01:41:58,892 --> 01:42:00,122
It's like a musical.

1634
01:42:00,362 --> 01:42:01,892
I think we should do something bold.

1635
01:42:01,992 --> 01:42:05,732
We will still bring out incredible content where...

1636
01:42:05,832 --> 01:42:07,232
it's undeniably good.

1637
01:42:07,502 --> 01:42:09,332
(Which crew will be the star of the finale stage?)

1638
01:42:12,072 --> 01:42:13,372
Good morning.

1639
01:42:14,002 --> 01:42:15,002
Food!

1640
01:42:15,002 --> 01:42:17,212
Soul to Seoul

1641
01:42:17,312 --> 01:42:19,442
(The dancers start their morning singing.)

1642
01:42:19,542 --> 01:42:21,742
(Upon arriving, they start the practice...)

1643
01:42:21,742 --> 01:42:22,742
(even before unpacking.)

1644
01:42:22,742 --> 01:42:24,282
(Shall we go?)

1645
01:42:24,482 --> 01:42:26,952
(Today will be the first step...)

1646
01:42:26,952 --> 01:42:29,222
(towards the last mission.)

1647
01:42:29,652 --> 01:42:31,492
(With unwilting passion,)

1648
01:42:31,492 --> 01:42:32,522
I love it.

1649
01:42:32,852 --> 01:42:36,422
(everyone is in battle mode today.)

1650
01:42:36,422 --> 01:42:37,462
This part.

1651
01:42:37,492 --> 01:42:38,992
(All 3 crews have gathered.)

1652
01:42:39,092 --> 01:42:41,062
Today is going to be exciting.

1653
01:42:41,062 --> 01:42:43,472
We get to do the JYP Challenge.

1654
01:42:43,472 --> 01:42:44,972
- Yes! - Yes!

1655
01:42:45,532 --> 01:42:48,642
Everything that we win, we don't get points for.

1656
01:42:48,642 --> 01:42:51,612
(Sad)

1657
01:42:51,612 --> 01:42:53,342
Maybe this time, we will get some points.

1658
01:42:53,342 --> 01:42:55,112
You guys. The bonus points are ours.

1659
01:42:55,282 --> 01:42:57,512
This mission is the most important thing.

1660
01:42:57,512 --> 01:43:00,082
Because it's going to put us in a spot where...

1661
01:43:00,082 --> 01:43:03,422
we have the advantage moving forward.

1662
01:43:03,522 --> 01:43:04,592
We can do this.

1663
01:43:04,592 --> 01:43:06,962
- We got this, guys. - Let's go, MOTIV.

1664
01:43:07,262 --> 01:43:09,722
- Snatch some bonus points. - Oh, yes.

1665
01:43:09,832 --> 01:43:11,762
Snatch the points.

1666
01:43:12,032 --> 01:43:13,632
This is really it.

1667
01:43:13,732 --> 01:43:17,132
Don't forget to clearly show our colors.

1668
01:43:17,132 --> 01:43:18,772
That's our strategy.

1669
01:43:18,872 --> 01:43:20,072
And let's keep pushing until the end.

1670
01:43:20,072 --> 01:43:21,102
- Yes. - Yes.

1671
01:43:21,202 --> 01:43:25,242
To win, we have to win the bonus points.

1672
01:43:25,772 --> 01:43:27,182
With this spirit, we will win the bonus points.

1673
01:43:27,842 --> 01:43:29,852
Today is the day to win another challenge.

1674
01:43:30,052 --> 01:43:32,612
We should win this because ours will be the best.

1675
01:43:32,612 --> 01:43:35,652
Let's get this challenge, and let's get another win for AG SQUAD.

1676
01:43:35,652 --> 01:43:37,452
- Yes! - Yes!

1677
01:43:38,192 --> 01:43:39,722
This is about to be crazy.

1678
01:43:39,722 --> 01:43:42,992
We want to take as many bonus points as possible.

1679
01:43:42,992 --> 01:43:44,832
Be proud of what we have done.

1680
01:43:51,632 --> 01:43:53,802
(The World Finale with JYP where bonus points are on the line)

1681
01:43:56,872 --> 01:43:59,012
(OSAKA Ojo Gang enters the fight zone first.)

1682
01:44:00,242 --> 01:44:01,682
Let's go.

1683
01:44:01,782 --> 01:44:05,452
We came to this show only to win.

1684
01:44:05,682 --> 01:44:07,452
To win the final,

1685
01:44:07,552 --> 01:44:09,122
we have to win the bonus points.

1686
01:44:09,892 --> 01:44:11,192
(Entering next is...)

1687
01:44:11,192 --> 01:44:12,892
AQ SQUAD is here.

1688
01:44:13,562 --> 01:44:14,662
(Looking)

1689
01:44:14,762 --> 01:44:15,922
(Tying tightly)

1690
01:44:17,462 --> 01:44:20,032
I feel nervous.

1691
01:44:20,302 --> 01:44:23,202
We really need to win the bonus points.

1692
01:44:23,302 --> 01:44:27,502
These points will help us to win World of Street Woman Fighter.

1693
01:44:27,672 --> 01:44:28,972
(Kaea takes out the fan she will use as a prop.)

1694
01:44:29,502 --> 01:44:30,542
A fan?

1695
01:44:30,642 --> 01:44:32,572
- Do you want to show the fans now? - No.

1696
01:44:33,342 --> 01:44:35,412
(She puts the fan back in.)

1697
01:44:35,512 --> 01:44:36,652
(They saw the fan.)

1698
01:44:37,182 --> 01:44:41,422
(MOTIV enters last.)

1699
01:44:43,452 --> 01:44:44,822
Okay. We will just do it fast.

1700
01:44:45,492 --> 01:44:46,762
Like a walkthrough of it.

1701
01:44:46,862 --> 01:44:48,822
You guys are still doing waacking and hip hop?

1702
01:44:48,822 --> 01:44:49,822
We've seen it.

1703
01:44:49,932 --> 01:44:51,192
(We'll see about that.)

1704
01:44:51,192 --> 01:44:54,002
MOTIV is a lot more versatile than you may think.

1705
01:44:54,802 --> 01:44:56,362
This time, we will get some points.

1706
01:44:56,462 --> 01:44:57,632
(We got this.)

1707
01:44:57,932 --> 01:44:59,602
Who are the judges?

1708
01:44:59,972 --> 01:45:01,272
Why is it three?

1709
01:45:01,272 --> 01:45:03,242
It's probably Mike Song and JYP.

1710
01:45:03,542 --> 01:45:06,342
Is it going to be like not only JYP?

1711
01:45:06,542 --> 01:45:07,712
(Who is...)

1712
01:45:07,712 --> 01:45:08,882
(here?)

1713
01:45:10,612 --> 01:45:12,952
(Fight Judge JYP)

1714
01:45:13,052 --> 01:45:15,282
(Happy to see him)

1715
01:45:15,522 --> 01:45:17,252
JYP!

1716
01:45:17,252 --> 01:45:18,552
Good morning!

1717
01:45:18,552 --> 01:45:22,062
I invited two of the best K-pop choreographers...

1718
01:45:22,522 --> 01:45:27,862
who will be judging the choreography with me,

1719
01:45:27,862 --> 01:45:29,302
with very fair eyes.

1720
01:45:29,432 --> 01:45:30,432
That's cool.

1721
01:45:30,532 --> 01:45:34,342
He choreographs for all the popular K-pop singers.

1722
01:45:34,742 --> 01:45:36,542
(Curious)

1723
01:45:36,542 --> 01:45:38,842
Vata of WE DEM BOYZ.

1724
01:45:39,312 --> 01:45:40,512
(No way.)

1725
01:45:40,512 --> 01:45:42,742
(Goodness!)

1726
01:45:42,742 --> 01:45:45,182
(Clapping)

1727
01:45:46,882 --> 01:45:48,352
Hello.

1728
01:45:49,182 --> 01:45:50,722
- Let's go! - I'm good.

1729
01:45:51,022 --> 01:45:53,692
He's from "World of Street Man Fighter."

1730
01:45:53,922 --> 01:45:55,862
I think he also made the Jennie dance.

1731
01:45:57,162 --> 01:45:58,832
Really? Oh, period.

1732
01:45:59,032 --> 01:46:01,762
(His crew's trendy dance moves captured the artists' hearts.)

1733
01:46:01,862 --> 01:46:03,162
(He's the leader of WE DEM BOYZ that won the second place...)

1734
01:46:03,162 --> 01:46:04,232
(on "World of Street Man Fighter.")

1735
01:46:04,332 --> 01:46:07,672
(Vata choreographed "like JENNIE" and created the next hype.)

1736
01:46:07,742 --> 01:46:09,472
The second judge is someone...

1737
01:46:09,572 --> 01:46:12,612
who has a deep connection with World of Street Woman Fighter.

1738
01:46:13,042 --> 01:46:17,452
It was a pleasure to see her again in BUMSUP's Mega Crew Mission.

1739
01:46:17,682 --> 01:46:18,682
It's Bada.

1740
01:46:21,052 --> 01:46:23,522
- Bada! - Go, Bada!

1741
01:46:24,292 --> 01:46:26,552
- Hello. - Bada!

1742
01:46:26,962 --> 01:46:30,932
Bada Lee competed against Kirsten, who I'm friends with.

1743
01:46:30,932 --> 01:46:32,192
She's very impressive.

1744
01:46:32,792 --> 01:46:34,962
(The leader of BEBE, winning crew of Street Woman Fighter 2)

1745
01:46:34,962 --> 01:46:36,332
(She has worked with many artists,)

1746
01:46:36,332 --> 01:46:37,672
(including KAI, aespa, NCT, and TAEMIN.)

1747
01:46:37,672 --> 01:46:40,142
(Choreographer Bada started the "Smoke" challenge syndrome.)

1748
01:46:40,502 --> 01:46:42,502
So personally,

1749
01:46:42,502 --> 01:46:44,972
the ability to express the music is very important.

1750
01:46:44,972 --> 01:46:46,842
But I think having technique within that,

1751
01:46:46,842 --> 01:46:50,112
not just expression, is important.

1752
01:46:50,112 --> 01:46:53,282
I will focus on how the dancing goes with the music...

1753
01:46:53,282 --> 01:46:56,852
and that team's unique color.

1754
01:46:57,022 --> 01:46:58,022
Let's go.

1755
01:46:58,592 --> 01:46:59,952
- Let's go. - Yes. I like that.

1756
01:46:59,952 --> 01:47:03,762
I like that she wants to see individuality and crew identity.

1757
01:47:03,762 --> 01:47:05,892
Since I'm a Korean person,

1758
01:47:06,092 --> 01:47:09,062
if I had gotten Jin Young's song,

1759
01:47:09,062 --> 01:47:10,972
I wouldn't have thought outside of the box.

1760
01:47:10,972 --> 01:47:14,572
I really can't imagine...

1761
01:47:14,572 --> 01:47:17,212
what these world-class dancers will do.

1762
01:47:17,212 --> 01:47:20,142
So I think I'll pick the crew...

1763
01:47:20,142 --> 01:47:23,582
that has that wow factor that makes me go,

1764
01:47:23,582 --> 01:47:26,152
"I didn't even think about that."

1765
01:47:26,152 --> 01:47:27,552
(We look forward to your judging.)

1766
01:47:27,852 --> 01:47:28,982
Okay.

1767
01:47:29,222 --> 01:47:30,992
So the 1st out of the 3 teams...

1768
01:47:31,622 --> 01:47:35,892
that will show us their choreography for "Gatsby" is...

1769
01:47:36,222 --> 01:47:37,992
(Who will it be?)

1770
01:47:38,092 --> 01:47:39,832
MOTIV. Let's go!

1771
01:47:39,832 --> 01:47:41,102
Go, MOTIV!

1772
01:47:41,102 --> 01:47:42,532
- Let's go, MOTIV! - Let's go!

1773
01:47:42,532 --> 01:47:44,332
- Let's go, girls! - Go, go!

1774
01:47:44,332 --> 01:47:46,102
Let's go!

1775
01:47:46,102 --> 01:47:48,142
Oh, my gosh. I'm so excited.

1776
01:47:48,342 --> 01:47:49,872
And their genre is hip-hop.

1777
01:47:49,872 --> 01:47:51,442
- Hip-hop for this song... - Exactly.

1778
01:47:51,672 --> 01:47:54,012
I'm curious to see how they interpreted it.

1779
01:47:54,482 --> 01:47:56,582
What's your MOTIV?

1780
01:47:57,282 --> 01:47:59,252
Make sure to stretch before we go, girls.

1781
01:48:00,322 --> 01:48:02,352
- Hello. - Hi.

1782
01:48:02,352 --> 01:48:03,522
- Hi. - Hi.

1783
01:48:03,522 --> 01:48:07,722
MOTIV. Have you guys tried this type of music and dance before?

1784
01:48:10,132 --> 01:48:13,732
MOTIV? A hip-hop image.

1785
01:48:13,732 --> 01:48:17,202
I feel like when it comes to MOTIV, they're going to do hip-hop.

1786
01:48:19,532 --> 01:48:22,602
I know some of us did jazz, and they are technically trained.

1787
01:48:22,602 --> 01:48:25,442
Bella, Nyssa, and Kaidi.

1788
01:48:25,442 --> 01:48:28,812
So certain things came out naturally...

1789
01:48:28,812 --> 01:48:32,682
as far as what we were listening to and how it influenced our approach.

1790
01:48:32,812 --> 01:48:35,882
I think that, just off of the basis of the song,

1791
01:48:35,882 --> 01:48:39,922
it had an old-time feel.

1792
01:48:39,922 --> 01:48:41,292
There was some nostalgia.

1793
01:48:41,292 --> 01:48:44,092
So we wanted to make something...

1794
01:48:44,092 --> 01:48:46,692
that still honored our style as MOTIV.

1795
01:48:46,692 --> 01:48:49,432
And I feel like it's something that really meshes well...

1796
01:48:49,432 --> 01:48:52,132
with the vibe of Park Jin Young's.

1797
01:48:52,132 --> 01:48:56,042
So we decided to incorporate hip-hop, tap, locking,

1798
01:48:56,042 --> 01:48:58,742
and then there's some jazz influences.

1799
01:48:58,742 --> 01:49:01,382
And I think what we did choreographically is fun.

1800
01:49:01,382 --> 01:49:04,612
I think that's what Park Jin Young will see.

1801
01:49:04,612 --> 01:49:06,212
Yes, Park Jin Young. We're giving you something...

1802
01:49:06,212 --> 01:49:08,122
out of MOTIV's box.

1803
01:49:08,182 --> 01:49:09,522
Park Jin Young. This one's for you.

1804
01:49:09,522 --> 01:49:11,092
- Yes. - Oh, yes.

1805
01:49:11,092 --> 01:49:12,092
Let's win.

1806
01:49:12,092 --> 01:49:13,822
For sure.

1807
01:49:14,192 --> 01:49:16,992
In order to get the most points in this mission,

1808
01:49:17,092 --> 01:49:20,262
I'm just ready to give it everything we've got.

1809
01:49:20,262 --> 01:49:22,602
I feel super confident...

1810
01:49:22,732 --> 01:49:26,102
because I do feel that we are one of the strongest teams...

1811
01:49:26,102 --> 01:49:28,142
in World of Street Woman Fighter.

1812
01:49:28,772 --> 01:49:30,272
Oh, I'm so curious.

1813
01:49:30,272 --> 01:49:31,272
Ready?

1814
01:49:31,542 --> 01:49:32,972
Fight!

1815
01:49:33,582 --> 01:49:35,082
I'm so excited. Oh, my gosh.

1816
01:49:38,112 --> 01:49:39,252
(Focused)

1817
01:49:39,252 --> 01:49:40,582
(Moving to the beat)

1818
01:49:40,582 --> 01:49:42,722
(MOTIV groove)

1819
01:49:53,362 --> 01:49:54,832
(This is fun.)

1820
01:49:56,502 --> 01:49:58,102
I like that.

1821
01:49:59,132 --> 01:50:00,602
Yes!

1822
01:50:01,142 --> 01:50:02,142
Oh, my.

1823
01:50:02,142 --> 01:50:03,742
(Getting chills)

1824
01:50:11,012 --> 01:50:13,452
(Perfect teamwork)

1825
01:50:16,652 --> 01:50:17,652
Look at their facial expressions.

1826
01:50:18,322 --> 01:50:20,052
Their expression is no joke.

1827
01:50:21,462 --> 01:50:22,662
(Facial expression genius)

1828
01:50:31,732 --> 01:50:32,732
(Dance break time)

1829
01:50:32,732 --> 01:50:33,742
(Locking attack)

1830
01:50:36,342 --> 01:50:38,172
(Flashy)

1831
01:50:38,172 --> 01:50:39,372
(He can't help but feel the rhythm.)

1832
01:50:40,242 --> 01:50:41,242
Come on!

1833
01:50:48,922 --> 01:50:50,452
(Showing off some steps)

1834
01:50:50,452 --> 01:50:52,392
(That's it.)

1835
01:50:55,292 --> 01:50:56,292
(Nice!)

1836
01:51:01,532 --> 01:51:03,102
(Let's go.)

1837
01:51:06,002 --> 01:51:07,172
(I'm into this.)

1838
01:51:10,742 --> 01:51:11,972
(Me too)

1839
01:51:13,842 --> 01:51:15,442
Come on, Abby!

1840
01:51:20,212 --> 01:51:23,182
(Everyone cheers.)

1841
01:51:24,452 --> 01:51:27,562
(MOTIV's performance is over.)

1842
01:51:27,892 --> 01:51:30,122
Oh, my gosh.

1843
01:51:30,632 --> 01:51:33,362
(What did they think of MOTIV's performance?)

1844
01:51:35,002 --> 01:51:36,832
So first,

1845
01:51:36,832 --> 01:51:39,902
the tap dance part during the dance break.

1846
01:51:39,902 --> 01:51:41,772
I loved it so much.

1847
01:51:41,772 --> 01:51:44,942
It went so well with the music,

1848
01:51:44,942 --> 01:51:47,942
but you didn't lose your team's color.

1849
01:51:47,942 --> 01:51:50,352
I think that was the most important factor.

1850
01:51:50,582 --> 01:51:52,652
You expressed that so well.

1851
01:51:52,952 --> 01:51:55,022
Oh, my. It was so cool.

1852
01:51:55,022 --> 01:51:56,682
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1853
01:51:56,682 --> 01:51:59,752
- Thank you. - My favorite part was the chorus.

1854
01:51:59,752 --> 01:52:01,262
You had that jazz swing step,

1855
01:52:01,262 --> 01:52:03,192
but you gave it a twist...

1856
01:52:03,192 --> 01:52:05,732
and changed up the rhythm. It was so cool.

1857
01:52:05,732 --> 01:52:08,662
I want to dance the chorus part right now.

1858
01:52:08,662 --> 01:52:09,662
But...

1859
01:52:10,302 --> 01:52:12,472
one thing that could've been done better...

1860
01:52:12,472 --> 01:52:15,342
was a lack of changes in the big picture.

1861
01:52:15,342 --> 01:52:17,372
For example, you could've changed up the formation...

1862
01:52:17,372 --> 01:52:19,242
to give it a wow factor.

1863
01:52:19,342 --> 01:52:22,242
Or you could've lied down, stopped, or something like that.

1864
01:52:22,242 --> 01:52:23,912
I wished you used...

1865
01:52:23,912 --> 01:52:26,782
a big change or a big shift.

1866
01:52:26,782 --> 01:52:28,022
That's what I thought.

1867
01:52:29,222 --> 01:52:30,222
Did you hear that?

1868
01:52:30,592 --> 01:52:32,022
He said they had no picture.

1869
01:52:32,192 --> 01:52:33,192
We do.

1870
01:52:34,892 --> 01:52:36,592
Yes, thank you for your performance.

1871
01:52:36,592 --> 01:52:38,362
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1872
01:52:38,362 --> 01:52:40,292
Thank you so much, guys.

1873
01:52:40,802 --> 01:52:42,262
That was the only one part that was lacking.

1874
01:52:42,262 --> 01:52:44,032
It was this flow the whole time.

1875
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:45,472
- The flow was a bit lacking. - Right.

1876
01:52:46,172 --> 01:52:48,102
We won this, right? I feel bad, but...

1877
01:52:48,102 --> 01:52:49,442
- Let's have fun. - Let's have fun.

1878
01:52:49,672 --> 01:52:52,242
That was fun. I'm so happy we did it like we were attacking.

1879
01:52:52,512 --> 01:52:54,382
- Yes. - That was so necessary.

1880
01:52:54,642 --> 01:52:57,152
(Will MOTIV get the bonus points?)

1881
01:52:57,612 --> 01:52:58,612
The next team.

1882
01:52:58,882 --> 01:53:00,822
Please come onto the stage.

1883
01:53:00,822 --> 01:53:02,252
OSAKA Ojo Gang.

1884
01:53:02,252 --> 01:53:03,322
(The second team up, OSAKA Ojo Gang)

1885
01:53:03,322 --> 01:53:04,592
Let's go!

1886
01:53:04,592 --> 01:53:05,992
Let's go.

1887
01:53:06,122 --> 01:53:08,122
They're an all-genre team.

1888
01:53:08,122 --> 01:53:09,462
I wonder what they'll show us.

1889
01:53:10,862 --> 01:53:13,632
I feel like the biggest threat to us...

1890
01:53:13,632 --> 01:53:14,902
would be Ojo Gang.

1891
01:53:15,262 --> 01:53:18,432
Honest, I had no idea what Ojo Gang was going to do.

1892
01:53:18,432 --> 01:53:21,472
Each member, individually, is different.

1893
01:53:21,472 --> 01:53:24,972
So it will really depend on who's choreographing.

1894
01:53:24,972 --> 01:53:27,072
Ojo Gang's choreographers...

1895
01:53:27,072 --> 01:53:29,342
were Ruu and Minami.

1896
01:53:29,512 --> 01:53:30,852
I really don't know what to expect.

1897
01:53:30,852 --> 01:53:34,152
So Gatsby has a slick-back hair image.

1898
01:53:34,152 --> 01:53:36,582
We used that slick-back hair image...

1899
01:53:36,582 --> 01:53:39,392
as the key move for the chorus.

1900
01:53:39,722 --> 01:53:44,092
We believe Ojo Gang's strength is the uniqueness of each member.

1901
01:53:44,092 --> 01:53:46,132
We have members playing masculine roles,

1902
01:53:46,132 --> 01:53:48,262
and we have members playing feminine roles.

1903
01:53:48,262 --> 01:53:50,302
We're dancing the same moves,

1904
01:53:50,302 --> 01:53:53,432
but we'll show our individuality. We made a performance...

1905
01:53:53,432 --> 01:53:55,172
that really feels like a party.

1906
01:53:56,042 --> 01:53:57,912
Oh, I'm excited for Ojo Gang.

1907
01:53:57,912 --> 01:54:00,782
- Oh, my. - Oh, we have a mic on stage.

1908
01:54:00,782 --> 01:54:02,142
They're using a standing mic.

1909
01:54:02,442 --> 01:54:03,642
Oh, they're using a mic.

1910
01:54:03,642 --> 01:54:04,652
Creative.

1911
01:54:04,752 --> 01:54:05,752
Okay, mic.

1912
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:07,152
Make strong facial expressions.

1913
01:54:08,122 --> 01:54:09,122
Let's have fun.

1914
01:54:09,382 --> 01:54:12,192
I believe we have to do our best...

1915
01:54:12,192 --> 01:54:14,192
to show everyone an Ojo Gang that suits this song.

1916
01:54:14,192 --> 01:54:15,792
This Park Jin Young mission.

1917
01:54:15,792 --> 01:54:17,562
I'm confident that we'll get chosen.

1918
01:54:19,562 --> 01:54:22,102
Oh, they're the guys and four girls.

1919
01:54:22,102 --> 01:54:23,632
The formation is already a bit different.

1920
01:54:23,632 --> 01:54:25,572
- Ready? - Let's go!

1921
01:54:25,572 --> 01:54:26,632
Fight!

1922
01:54:26,632 --> 01:54:27,742
(How will OSAKA Ojo Gang's "Gatsby" be?)

1923
01:54:30,142 --> 01:54:32,412
(Ta-da)

1924
01:54:34,512 --> 01:54:35,512
(Oh, my!)

1925
01:54:52,092 --> 01:54:53,332
(Lifting up)

1926
01:55:06,012 --> 01:55:07,012
(Grooving together)

1927
01:55:18,522 --> 01:55:19,522
(Nervous)

1928
01:55:19,522 --> 01:55:21,092
(Oh, finally)

1929
01:55:25,492 --> 01:55:28,262
They took the approach of Kyoka being the singer.

1930
01:55:31,832 --> 01:55:32,832
Hey!

1931
01:55:51,852 --> 01:55:53,852
(Already into it)

1932
01:55:56,592 --> 01:55:57,592
Come on!

1933
01:56:11,212 --> 01:56:12,212
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's performance is over.)

1934
01:56:12,472 --> 01:56:13,472
Period!

1935
01:56:16,342 --> 01:56:18,452
- Very good. - That's it.

1936
01:56:18,452 --> 01:56:20,152
That was really good.

1937
01:56:20,852 --> 01:56:22,922
But it was very one-toned.

1938
01:56:23,022 --> 01:56:26,692
(What do the fight judges think?)

1939
01:56:26,792 --> 01:56:29,762
With this performance, they said, "This is Ojo Gang."

1940
01:56:29,762 --> 01:56:33,392
You utilized all of your unique colors,

1941
01:56:33,392 --> 01:56:37,032
but you also matched my style. The idea with the tie...

1942
01:56:37,032 --> 01:56:40,132
and the feel of a big show. I really liked that.

1943
01:56:40,602 --> 01:56:42,072
Oh, it's surprising.

1944
01:56:42,102 --> 01:56:44,172
I really liked the choreography.

1945
01:56:44,272 --> 01:56:45,372
Oh, I'm glad.

1946
01:56:45,372 --> 01:56:47,072
The formations in the beginning were really nice as well.

1947
01:56:47,072 --> 01:56:51,052
You had some complicated parts, but also the courage to stop.

1948
01:56:51,052 --> 01:56:52,112
That was really nice.

1949
01:56:52,112 --> 01:56:54,122
The only one part I felt was lacking...

1950
01:56:54,122 --> 01:56:56,652
I thought it would've been nice to have a wow moment...

1951
01:56:56,652 --> 01:56:57,752
during the dance break.

1952
01:56:57,752 --> 01:57:00,522
The current choreography was more focused...

1953
01:57:00,522 --> 01:57:02,522
on the artist. I thought that was lacking.

1954
01:57:02,522 --> 01:57:03,762
Oh, it was so cool.

1955
01:57:03,962 --> 01:57:05,462
Thank you.

1956
01:57:06,562 --> 01:57:08,062
Good job, everyone.

1957
01:57:08,232 --> 01:57:09,332
It was really nice.

1958
01:57:09,332 --> 01:57:11,772
I believe we did a good job of pinpointing...

1959
01:57:11,772 --> 01:57:14,142
the things that Park Jin Young likes.

1960
01:57:14,142 --> 01:57:16,442
I think there's a good chance that we'll get chosen.

1961
01:57:17,102 --> 01:57:19,572
Okay. The final team of the day.

1962
01:57:19,942 --> 01:57:21,812
AG SQUAD, please come to the stage.

1963
01:57:21,812 --> 01:57:22,812
(The last team up, AG SQUAD)

1964
01:57:22,812 --> 01:57:24,882
Let's go, AG SQUAD.

1965
01:57:24,882 --> 01:57:26,182
AG SQUAD.

1966
01:57:26,182 --> 01:57:28,482
How do you think AG SQUAD interpreted it?

1967
01:57:28,782 --> 01:57:30,122
Let's go, ladies.

1968
01:57:32,052 --> 01:57:33,292
They don't usually wear pink.

1969
01:57:33,792 --> 01:57:37,092
The team I was most worried about was AG SQUAD.

1970
01:57:37,192 --> 01:57:42,062
AG SQUAD is really good at making choreographies artists like.

1971
01:57:42,062 --> 01:57:46,702
I'm interested to see what styles they implement into their piece.

1972
01:57:46,802 --> 01:57:48,772
Okay. Please tell us when you're ready.

1973
01:57:48,772 --> 01:57:50,272
- Thank you. - Let's go!

1974
01:57:50,442 --> 01:57:51,442
- Okay. - Let's go!

1975
01:57:51,542 --> 01:57:52,542
Let's go, everyone.

1976
01:57:52,542 --> 01:57:54,082
I'm prepared to be wowed.

1977
01:57:54,712 --> 01:57:57,312
(They're holding something in their hands.)

1978
01:57:57,312 --> 01:57:59,952
What? They have props.

1979
01:57:59,952 --> 01:58:01,222
They do have props.

1980
01:58:01,822 --> 01:58:05,292
I feel like our highlight from our Park Jin Young mission...

1981
01:58:05,292 --> 01:58:07,292
would be the fans that we used.

1982
01:58:07,292 --> 01:58:08,562
And we have...

1983
01:58:09,092 --> 01:58:12,162
props today for this challenge.

1984
01:58:12,362 --> 01:58:14,702
We have been drilling it,

1985
01:58:14,702 --> 01:58:17,002
and we wanted to make sure we were prepared...

1986
01:58:17,202 --> 01:58:19,172
so we can win this challenge as well.

1987
01:58:19,472 --> 01:58:21,242
We did our research, but also...

1988
01:58:21,242 --> 01:58:22,572
He likes to perform a lot.

1989
01:58:22,572 --> 01:58:25,972
He does like to dance a lot in his performances.

1990
01:58:26,212 --> 01:58:28,342
Our concept for this mission...

1991
01:58:28,342 --> 01:58:30,482
is "Modern but Now."

1992
01:58:30,482 --> 01:58:35,252
We're incorporating cabaret vibes, foxy vibes,

1993
01:58:35,922 --> 01:58:39,292
and that overall "come-join-the-party" vibes.

1994
01:58:39,922 --> 01:58:42,092
If he knows what he wants and he wants the best,

1995
01:58:42,092 --> 01:58:44,532
- he will pick AG SQUAD today. - He will pick ours.

1996
01:58:44,532 --> 01:58:47,232
That's very different from what we would usually do,

1997
01:58:47,232 --> 01:58:48,832
but we're ready to go

1998
01:58:48,832 --> 01:58:50,402
to show that we're the best.

1999
01:58:51,002 --> 01:58:52,232
- Are you ready? - Yes.

2000
01:58:52,232 --> 01:58:53,432
- Are you ready? - Let's go, girls.

2001
01:58:53,432 --> 01:58:54,672
I like the fans.

2002
01:58:54,672 --> 01:58:56,642
- Let's have fun. - Have fun.

2003
01:58:57,512 --> 01:59:00,012
Again, we get to show a different side of us.

2004
01:59:00,212 --> 01:59:02,282
So I feel like he'll appreciate it,

2005
01:59:02,282 --> 01:59:04,452
and he will hopefully pick us.

2006
01:59:05,152 --> 01:59:06,752
Ready? Fight!

2007
01:59:07,822 --> 01:59:09,652
(How will AG SQUAD's "Gatsby" be?)

2008
01:59:24,172 --> 01:59:25,232
Fun.

2009
01:59:25,232 --> 01:59:26,732
(Oh, my gosh, AG SQUAD)

2010
01:59:28,242 --> 01:59:29,272
(Nimble)

2011
01:59:36,012 --> 01:59:37,042
Hey.

2012
01:59:41,682 --> 01:59:42,682
Oh, my!

2013
01:59:44,922 --> 01:59:45,922
They're good.

2014
01:59:53,332 --> 01:59:54,602
(I want to do it too.)

2015
02:00:05,872 --> 02:00:07,742
- Come on! - Let's go!

2016
02:00:10,812 --> 02:00:11,852
(I love it.)

2017
02:00:14,822 --> 02:00:17,382
(Automatically moving to the beat)

2018
02:00:22,192 --> 02:00:23,192
Go!

2019
02:00:27,962 --> 02:00:29,202
(Oh, my. These girls are great!)

2020
02:00:42,812 --> 02:00:44,012
Hey!

2021
02:01:02,162 --> 02:01:05,302
(AG SQUAD's performance is over.)

2022
02:01:05,302 --> 02:01:07,602
(AG is crazy.)

2023
02:01:07,602 --> 02:01:11,012
(That was amazing.)

2024
02:01:11,272 --> 02:01:12,712
We're very happy.

2025
02:01:12,712 --> 02:01:15,012
They're amazing, but we're also amazing.

2026
02:01:15,012 --> 02:01:17,012
And I think we fit the theme well.

2027
02:01:17,012 --> 02:01:18,982
I think ours was better.

2028
02:01:19,212 --> 02:01:20,482
(What do the fight judges think?)

2029
02:01:20,482 --> 02:01:22,982
The first impression I got was that it was very flashy.

2030
02:01:23,222 --> 02:01:24,452
(Nervous)

2031
02:01:24,452 --> 02:01:26,222
It was such a show.

2032
02:01:26,222 --> 02:01:28,592
It had everything. Jazz, swing, and cabaret.

2033
02:01:30,022 --> 02:01:31,932
I don't know if this is the right word to say,

2034
02:01:31,932 --> 02:01:33,192
but that was sick.

2035
02:01:34,502 --> 02:01:35,562
Thank you.

2036
02:01:35,802 --> 02:01:37,262
It was just sick.

2037
02:01:37,262 --> 02:01:38,272
Thank you.

2038
02:01:38,272 --> 02:01:41,642
The way you used the props was very smart.

2039
02:01:41,642 --> 02:01:46,612
The flashy formations and the musical-like expressions.

2040
02:01:46,612 --> 02:01:48,442
That's what I liked the most.

2041
02:01:49,282 --> 02:01:52,512
Korean dancers wouldn't have come up with this choreography.

2042
02:01:52,512 --> 02:01:54,152
- You're right. - Oh, this is something...

2043
02:01:54,152 --> 02:01:56,352
we can only see on World of Street Woman Fighter.

2044
02:01:56,352 --> 02:01:57,852
That's what I thought.

2045
02:01:57,852 --> 02:02:00,192
This performance defied my expectations the most.

2046
02:02:00,192 --> 02:02:02,122
So I am a bit worried.

2047
02:02:02,222 --> 02:02:04,122
The thing I'm worried about...

2048
02:02:04,122 --> 02:02:07,032
is that it's very difficult, but I'm not sure if that's good.

2049
02:02:07,032 --> 02:02:09,462
Will it be a professional performance?

2050
02:02:09,462 --> 02:02:12,502
Or will it be an easy performance that the public can follow?

2051
02:02:12,502 --> 02:02:15,142
I briefly thought about that.

2052
02:02:15,502 --> 02:02:17,172
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

2053
02:02:17,172 --> 02:02:18,242
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2054
02:02:19,472 --> 02:02:21,712
If he wants to be good, he'll pick us.

2055
02:02:21,912 --> 02:02:23,842
I'm very confident about today.

2056
02:02:23,842 --> 02:02:26,682
I think Park Jin Young will pick our routine.

2057
02:02:26,682 --> 02:02:29,422
Okay, ladies. Give us one minute to decide.

2058
02:02:30,852 --> 02:02:32,492
Oh, that was seriously insane.

2059
02:02:32,492 --> 02:02:33,652
(They must choose 1 crew out of the 3 crews.)

2060
02:02:34,252 --> 02:02:35,262
Oh, we killed it.

2061
02:02:35,262 --> 02:02:37,222
They were like gobsmacked.

2062
02:02:37,222 --> 02:02:38,432
We did our best.

2063
02:02:38,462 --> 02:02:39,892
(But Kaea looks concerned.)

2064
02:02:40,032 --> 02:02:41,502
Oh, so many thoughts.

2065
02:02:42,132 --> 02:02:44,872
So many thoughts and feelings.

2066
02:02:44,872 --> 02:02:46,302
(Marlee is concerned too.)

2067
02:02:46,302 --> 02:02:49,142
I really think ours was the best considering the balance.

2068
02:02:49,142 --> 02:02:50,802
I think everyone will be happy.

2069
02:02:50,802 --> 02:02:52,172
(Meanwhile, Ibuki is confident.)

2070
02:02:52,342 --> 02:02:54,612
Oh, this is hard. This is so hard.

2071
02:02:54,612 --> 02:02:57,342
But if I have to choose quickly,

2072
02:02:57,342 --> 02:02:58,912
- AG SQUAD. - AG?

2073
02:02:59,382 --> 02:03:01,622
It's a vibe I've never seen.

2074
02:03:02,082 --> 02:03:05,522
When I think, "What's new? What will you bring?"

2075
02:03:05,522 --> 02:03:08,462
It felt as if they said, "This is 2025 choreography."

2076
02:03:08,462 --> 02:03:11,162
"We brought the best moves for this song." It feels like that.

2077
02:03:11,892 --> 02:03:13,432
I liked Ojo Gang the best.

2078
02:03:13,432 --> 02:03:14,962
- It pulls you in. - Right.

2079
02:03:14,962 --> 02:03:17,132
I think the color of the team is the most important.

2080
02:03:17,132 --> 02:03:19,172
When I did a mission with Hwasa,

2081
02:03:19,172 --> 02:03:21,602
I thought it was the most important...

2082
02:03:21,602 --> 02:03:23,472
to show our color, but at the same time,

2083
02:03:23,472 --> 02:03:25,712
make it work when Hwasa joins us too.

2084
02:03:25,712 --> 02:03:28,782
That's why I thought Ojo Gang must be good.

2085
02:03:28,942 --> 02:03:31,312
In terms of fun, MOTIV was the most fun.

2086
02:03:31,952 --> 02:03:33,912
I was so happy to see jazz.

2087
02:03:33,912 --> 02:03:36,652
I could already imagine what MOTIV would do.

2088
02:03:37,122 --> 02:03:39,692
This isn't about me releasing a new song.

2089
02:03:39,692 --> 02:03:42,422
It's about me making a song for their performance.

2090
02:03:42,422 --> 02:03:45,332
- Totally. - So it has to be...

2091
02:03:45,332 --> 02:03:46,332
the coolest show...

2092
02:03:46,332 --> 02:03:48,662
- for the audience and viewers. - Totally.

2093
02:03:48,862 --> 02:03:50,932
- AG SQUAD was the coolest. - AG.

2094
02:03:51,802 --> 02:03:53,302
But MOTIV...

2095
02:03:53,302 --> 02:03:54,972
But why do I like Ojo Gang so much?

2096
02:03:55,542 --> 02:03:58,412
Their choreography for the chorus was clean and memorable.

2097
02:03:58,412 --> 02:03:59,412
(It's very hard for Jin Young to decide.)

2098
02:03:59,412 --> 02:04:01,942
I feel like there'll be a plot twist.

2099
02:04:01,942 --> 02:04:04,682
I think they're going to say, "Although..."

2100
02:04:05,852 --> 02:04:08,952
Even if we have a million chances, I'd really do the same choreography.

2101
02:04:08,952 --> 02:04:09,952
Seriously.

2102
02:04:09,952 --> 02:04:11,392
I have no regrets at all.

2103
02:04:11,992 --> 02:04:15,022
Okay. I'll announce the results.

2104
02:04:15,822 --> 02:04:17,692
The World Finale with JYP Mission.

2105
02:04:19,932 --> 02:04:22,302
We did good. MOTIV number one.

2106
02:04:25,532 --> 02:04:28,942
We really need to win the bonus points for the final.

2107
02:04:31,212 --> 02:04:33,212
I believe we must win the points here.

2108
02:04:35,282 --> 02:04:38,882
The final choreography that we chose.

2109
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:41,052
The team that made that choreography is...

2110
02:04:41,052 --> 02:04:43,352
(Which team will be chosen and win the bonus points?)

2111
02:04:43,382 --> 02:04:46,322
(It will be revealed shortly.)

2112
02:04:51,892 --> 02:04:54,092
(Stars of the World Finale Stage, AG SQUAD)

2113
02:05:15,822 --> 02:05:18,052
("Gatsby" by Park Jin Young)

2114
02:07:22,582 --> 02:07:23,742
(You can listen to "Gatsby," the song...)

2115
02:07:23,742 --> 02:07:27,952
(for the World Finale with JYP Mission on Spotify now.)

2116
02:07:39,292 --> 02:07:42,732
The final choreography that we chose.

2117
02:07:43,702 --> 02:07:45,632
It's AG SQUAD.

2118
02:07:45,632 --> 02:07:47,772
(AG SQUAD won Jin Young's heart.)

2119
02:07:48,802 --> 02:07:49,802
Congratulations!

2120
02:07:50,142 --> 02:07:51,612
Thank you!

2121
02:07:53,842 --> 02:07:55,342
- Thank you! - Thank you!

2122
02:07:55,342 --> 02:07:57,282
- Thank you! - Thank you!

2123
02:07:57,842 --> 02:07:59,112
Thank you!

2124
02:08:00,382 --> 02:08:01,922
Smile, everyone!

2125
02:08:02,322 --> 02:08:04,382
Their performance felt most like a party.

2126
02:08:04,382 --> 02:08:06,192
It was most like a party. That's right.

2127
02:08:06,622 --> 02:08:07,892
(AG is so cool.)

2128
02:08:07,892 --> 02:08:09,492
(Congratulations!)

2129
02:08:09,862 --> 02:08:10,962
Good work, girls.

2130
02:08:11,832 --> 02:08:13,362
(Pleased)

2131
02:08:14,062 --> 02:08:16,632
- We do get bonus points! - We do.

2132
02:08:17,562 --> 02:08:20,932
We were very happy about this result.

2133
02:08:20,932 --> 02:08:24,442
We're finally going up in this competition.

2134
02:08:24,442 --> 02:08:26,142
And after going so low.

2135
02:08:26,142 --> 02:08:29,412
So it was a great feeling to be picked for this.

2136
02:08:29,842 --> 02:08:32,112
Please vote for us, everyone.

2137
02:08:32,112 --> 02:08:34,822
Because we want to win this. It's all or nothing.

2138
02:08:34,822 --> 02:08:36,482
We can take that trophy home.

2139
02:08:38,252 --> 02:08:40,752
It's truly an honor...

2140
02:08:41,192 --> 02:08:43,462
to be able to watch and judge...

2141
02:08:43,462 --> 02:08:45,462
these world-class dancers.

2142
02:08:46,032 --> 02:08:49,302
Actually, MOTIV is my favorite team.

2143
02:08:49,302 --> 02:08:51,132
I was so jealous.

2144
02:08:51,372 --> 02:08:55,472
I was so jealous that you understood...

2145
02:08:55,472 --> 02:08:56,502
that classic American swag.

2146
02:08:56,502 --> 02:09:00,142
You had such great expression, so I really enjoyed watching you.

2147
02:09:00,642 --> 02:09:04,682
What I kept feeling...

2148
02:09:04,682 --> 02:09:06,552
while watching OSAKA Ojo Gang...

2149
02:09:06,652 --> 02:09:10,352
was that you mixed in...

2150
02:09:10,352 --> 02:09:12,592
traditional, classic dances.

2151
02:09:12,592 --> 02:09:14,962
Oh, this is Ojo Gang's style.

2152
02:09:15,062 --> 02:09:18,892
I think that's Osaka's swag.

2153
02:09:19,292 --> 02:09:21,862
During the first mission,

2154
02:09:21,962 --> 02:09:23,462
I was worried...

2155
02:09:24,002 --> 02:09:27,632
about AG SQUAD doing...

2156
02:09:27,632 --> 02:09:28,842
a wide spectrum of dancing.

2157
02:09:29,102 --> 02:09:32,972
But Round 1, Round 2, Round 3,

2158
02:09:32,972 --> 02:09:34,312
and to the semi-final round,

2159
02:09:34,572 --> 02:09:37,142
your range kept getting bigger.

2160
02:09:37,142 --> 02:09:39,052
"They can do this kind of dance? They have this kind of color?"

2161
02:09:39,512 --> 02:09:43,452
I think it was a process of you proving that.

2162
02:09:43,652 --> 02:09:46,652
And again today, I thought, "This is AG SQUAD's choreography?"

2163
02:09:46,752 --> 02:09:50,292
I couldn't believe it. You're a team that always transforms.

2164
02:09:51,562 --> 02:09:54,802
What I really wanted to tell you when I met you...

2165
02:09:55,362 --> 02:09:57,062
was that I'm so grateful.

2166
02:09:57,162 --> 02:10:00,432
I felt so much passion and was so inspired.

2167
02:10:00,432 --> 02:10:04,372
So many people are watching your performances,

2168
02:10:04,472 --> 02:10:06,572
and I respect you all so much. Thank you.

2169
02:10:06,672 --> 02:10:09,812
Thanks to you all,

2170
02:10:10,612 --> 02:10:13,712
the Korean dance scene and the global dance scene...

2171
02:10:13,812 --> 02:10:15,722
became so diverse.

2172
02:10:15,822 --> 02:10:18,422
I want you to show people everything you want to show.

2173
02:10:18,422 --> 02:10:21,692
You're all such world-class dancers.

2174
02:10:21,692 --> 02:10:23,462
So I hope you have a magnificent finale.

2175
02:10:23,462 --> 02:10:25,832
You all worked so hard.

2176
02:10:26,032 --> 02:10:29,562
As the person making the music, I almost felt...

2177
02:10:29,962 --> 02:10:33,702
that I didn't deserve your work. Thank you all so much.

2178
02:10:33,802 --> 02:10:36,442
We'll wrap up today's mission here. Thank you.

2179
02:10:36,772 --> 02:10:39,512
- Thank you. - Yes!

2180
02:10:39,512 --> 02:10:41,582
- Thank you. - Yes!

2181
02:10:44,852 --> 02:10:46,812
(Real-Time Voting is now over.)

2182
02:10:47,812 --> 02:10:48,822
Five.

2183
02:10:49,682 --> 02:10:50,682
Four.

2184
02:10:51,622 --> 02:10:52,652
Three.

2185
02:10:53,692 --> 02:10:54,692
Two.

2186
02:10:55,722 --> 02:10:56,722
One.

2187
02:10:57,862 --> 02:10:59,992
The live vote has now closed.

2188
02:11:05,232 --> 02:11:07,532
A global dance battle of the world's strongest girls...

2189
02:11:07,532 --> 02:11:08,572
fighting for their pride.

2190
02:11:08,942 --> 02:11:13,012
World of Street Woman Fighter's Real-Time Vote is now over.

2191
02:11:13,842 --> 02:11:17,812
Thank you for your precious votes from all over the world.

2192
02:11:19,312 --> 02:11:21,252
(The announcement was made with the voters in attendance.)

2193
02:11:21,252 --> 02:11:25,152
Now, we only have the Real-Time Vote score,

2194
02:11:25,552 --> 02:11:28,192
the last variable to decide the final score, left.

2195
02:11:29,122 --> 02:11:30,992
How will the voting results...

2196
02:11:31,092 --> 02:11:33,792
change the destinies of our three crews?

2197
02:11:34,492 --> 02:11:37,162
Team Australia, AG SQUAD.

2198
02:11:41,772 --> 02:11:44,002
Team USA, MOTIV.

2199
02:11:48,382 --> 02:11:50,812
Team Japan, OSAKA Ojo Gang.

2200
02:11:54,682 --> 02:11:58,322
Who will be the final winning crew of these three crews?

2201
02:12:03,462 --> 02:12:05,832
While the final score is being calculated,

2202
02:12:05,832 --> 02:12:09,102
the last chapter of World of Street Woman Fighter will unfold.

2203
02:12:09,862 --> 02:12:12,902
The dancers who fiercely fought with the world as their stage...

2204
02:12:13,002 --> 02:12:16,702
prepared a message they want to share at the end of this journey.

2205
02:12:17,702 --> 02:12:20,772
The performances they loved, the moments they had together,

2206
02:12:21,212 --> 02:12:22,882
and the sincere stories they want to share...

2207
02:12:22,882 --> 02:12:25,812
with Street Woman Fighter before leaving Korea.

2208
02:12:26,652 --> 02:12:29,352
Thank you, Korea. Goodbye, Street Woman Fighter.

2209
02:12:29,822 --> 02:12:31,822
Let's watch it together.

2210
02:12:42,302 --> 02:12:45,372
Guys. This is our last day.

2211
02:12:45,372 --> 02:12:47,132
- Oh, my. - Last day.

2212
02:12:47,132 --> 02:12:48,972
- Last day. - Last day.

2213
02:12:49,072 --> 02:12:51,372
I can't believe it's our last day today.

2214
02:12:51,372 --> 02:12:53,472
And when we got here, it was freezing.

2215
02:12:53,472 --> 02:12:55,382
It was so cold.

2216
02:12:55,382 --> 02:12:56,682
(About 4 months ago)

2217
02:12:57,412 --> 02:12:59,682
(They started their journey with Street Woman Fighter...)

2218
02:12:59,682 --> 02:13:01,182
(with chilly weather.)

2219
02:13:01,382 --> 02:13:03,852
- AG SQUAD. - AG SQUAD.

2220
02:13:04,822 --> 02:13:07,192
- It's been a while. - It's been a while.

2221
02:13:07,192 --> 02:13:08,522
We're back.

2222
02:13:10,222 --> 02:13:12,832
It's gone. The fight zone.

2223
02:13:13,532 --> 02:13:15,902
The fight zone. No more.

2224
02:13:17,102 --> 02:13:18,632
Let's freaking go.

2225
02:13:19,402 --> 02:13:21,942
It's where we tackled the first half...

2226
02:13:21,942 --> 02:13:24,402
of this entire thing.

2227
02:13:24,402 --> 02:13:28,842
It feels bittersweet to be here for the last time.

2228
02:13:29,912 --> 02:13:30,912
No.

2229
02:13:31,712 --> 02:13:33,812
Lip J!

2230
02:13:34,382 --> 02:13:37,682
Some of their presence is missing. It's weird. It's throwing me off.

2231
02:13:37,682 --> 02:13:38,892
Not everyone is here.

2232
02:13:38,892 --> 02:13:40,922
Look at everyone's names on the stairs.

2233
02:13:40,922 --> 02:13:43,492
Oh, MOTIV. RHTokyo.

2234
02:13:43,492 --> 02:13:45,692
- ROYAL FAMILY. - ROYAL FAMILY.

2235
02:13:45,692 --> 02:13:47,832
- BUMSUP. - BUMSUP. AG SQUAD.

2236
02:13:47,832 --> 02:13:50,202
I still can't believe BUMSUP won't be at the finals.

2237
02:13:50,302 --> 02:13:52,532
BUMSUP. I miss you.

2238
02:13:52,902 --> 02:13:56,272
In the end, we were the team...

2239
02:13:56,372 --> 02:13:59,342
to beat BUMSUP in the battle.

2240
02:13:59,342 --> 02:14:03,642
But we can take the energy that they gave us...

2241
02:14:03,642 --> 02:14:07,082
in that last battle and take it into this final.

2242
02:14:07,082 --> 02:14:09,122
Let's take home the trophy for them,

2243
02:14:09,122 --> 02:14:11,122
as well as for ourselves, but you know.

2244
02:14:11,122 --> 02:14:13,322
These girls had our backs, so let's have their backs.

2245
02:14:14,292 --> 02:14:16,962
(We could write our story because all crews were together.)

2246
02:14:17,322 --> 02:14:19,492
(The 3 crews are on their last journey.)

2247
02:14:20,062 --> 02:14:22,002
So many things happened here.

2248
02:14:22,862 --> 02:14:25,502
(They got 2nd place in expected crew to win.)

2249
02:14:27,532 --> 02:14:30,742
(OSAKA Ojo Gang showed up full of Osaka vigor.)

2250
02:14:31,772 --> 02:14:33,412
(Our Osaka mind is still alive.)

2251
02:14:33,712 --> 02:14:35,112
(A successful encore performance)

2252
02:14:35,112 --> 02:14:36,482
So nostalgic.

2253
02:14:36,842 --> 02:14:38,412
We have many memories here.

2254
02:14:38,412 --> 02:14:39,552
Right?

2255
02:14:39,652 --> 02:14:41,512
And do you remember that?

2256
02:14:41,512 --> 02:14:43,082
There was the No Respect Battle.

2257
02:14:43,082 --> 02:14:44,952
- After that, the crew battle. - Right.

2258
02:14:45,252 --> 02:14:46,822
When we went to the stage,

2259
02:14:46,822 --> 02:14:49,522
everyone was wearing matching crew outfits.

2260
02:14:49,822 --> 02:14:51,122
(Glancing)

2261
02:14:51,122 --> 02:14:52,132
Did you see?

2262
02:14:53,562 --> 02:14:54,862
Isn't that order-made?

2263
02:14:54,962 --> 02:14:57,602
That means they have the time to do things like that.

2264
02:14:58,108 --> 02:14:59,178
They have a lot of time.

2265
02:15:00,278 --> 02:15:01,978
(Team feeling 0 percent, Team feeling 100 percent)

2266
02:15:02,148 --> 02:15:04,178
We were criticized for that.

2267
02:15:04,178 --> 02:15:05,878
"Ojo Gang doesn't feel like a team."

2268
02:15:05,878 --> 02:15:08,588
"They're not good as a team." We heard things like that.

2269
02:15:08,688 --> 02:15:11,988
But now I think this is our color.

2270
02:15:13,088 --> 02:15:15,488
So it's our last time coming back here.

2271
02:15:15,488 --> 02:15:17,688
- It's very surreal. - Right.

2272
02:15:17,688 --> 02:15:19,358
I'm getting a lot of flashbacks.

2273
02:15:19,358 --> 02:15:21,458
If I'm being honest, I didn't think we would stay.

2274
02:15:21,928 --> 02:15:24,268
(AG SQUAD didn't do so well at the start.)

2275
02:15:24,668 --> 02:15:28,038
Stressful, unknowing, and not used to the space.

2276
02:15:28,038 --> 02:15:29,668
We had no battle experience.

2277
02:15:30,668 --> 02:15:33,938
We struggled a bit coming into the battles.

2278
02:15:35,048 --> 02:15:38,578
I feel like all these losses give us more fuel.

2279
02:15:38,578 --> 02:15:40,578
It's like it puts a battery in our backs...

2280
02:15:40,578 --> 02:15:42,348
to want to win even more for the next mission.

2281
02:15:44,148 --> 02:15:46,118
(The bitter losses became their power for their updraft.)

2282
02:15:46,758 --> 02:15:49,588
(AG SQUAD managed to complete the race to the finals.)

2283
02:15:49,988 --> 02:15:51,188
We proved ourselves...

2284
02:15:51,388 --> 02:15:52,898
every single time.

2285
02:15:52,898 --> 02:15:55,998
I feel the Mega Crew Mission was...

2286
02:15:55,998 --> 02:15:59,898
finally the moment where we showcased who MOTIV was.

2287
02:15:59,898 --> 02:16:01,968
Not only our identity as a team.

2288
02:16:02,208 --> 02:16:06,408
And it was the first moment that the world got to see...

2289
02:16:06,408 --> 02:16:07,978
who was representing America.

2290
02:16:07,978 --> 02:16:10,608
The fact that I got to do an article with Forbes...

2291
02:16:10,608 --> 02:16:12,248
It's really special.

2292
02:16:12,248 --> 02:16:14,518
(People of this world, this is our leader!)

2293
02:16:14,778 --> 02:16:17,388
A moment for Forbes. A moment for Marlee.

2294
02:16:17,388 --> 02:16:19,158
Good for us!

2295
02:16:19,158 --> 02:16:20,488
Period.

2296
02:16:21,018 --> 02:16:24,258
Just in our lives, so many things have changed since this show.

2297
02:16:24,388 --> 02:16:26,158
- So many. - So many things.

2298
02:16:26,158 --> 02:16:27,158
Good change.

2299
02:16:27,158 --> 02:16:31,128
And me and Vanessa were on the news in Australia.

2300
02:16:31,128 --> 02:16:32,638
- Yes. That was fun. - Yes.

2301
02:16:32,998 --> 02:16:36,208
AG SQUAD is competing on Street Woman Fighter.

2302
02:16:37,838 --> 02:16:40,338
It's definitely a highlight of all of our careers.

2303
02:16:40,338 --> 02:16:42,848
I've just been able to dance with these strong girls...

2304
02:16:42,848 --> 02:16:45,278
and represent Australia.

2305
02:16:45,948 --> 02:16:47,778
And they're racking up millions of views.

2306
02:16:47,778 --> 02:16:49,888
(Australia's top 13 Trending videos)

2307
02:16:49,888 --> 02:16:50,987
(Japan's top 1 Trending video)

2308
02:16:50,987 --> 02:16:52,958
I thought that the influence of the show was amazing.

2309
02:16:53,657 --> 02:16:57,058
The fact that is was trending in America is crazy.

2310
02:16:57,058 --> 02:16:59,958
To experience that level of...

2311
02:16:59,958 --> 02:17:02,498
love and energy was super crazy.

2312
02:17:02,498 --> 02:17:06,838
Yes. My life changed for real in the past half year.

2313
02:17:07,598 --> 02:17:09,567
You won't experience something like this...

2314
02:17:09,567 --> 02:17:10,938
no matter how great of a dancer you are.

2315
02:17:10,938 --> 02:17:13,278
There are a lot of things to be grateful for.

2316
02:17:13,737 --> 02:17:15,407
And through this show,

2317
02:17:15,407 --> 02:17:19,448
we were able to represent Japan as dancers.

2318
02:17:19,448 --> 02:17:22,188
So it's great that the show is giving us that...

2319
02:17:22,188 --> 02:17:24,848
exposure to get other opportunities.

2320
02:17:24,848 --> 02:17:28,218
Yes. This is just the beginning to many more blessings.

2321
02:17:28,218 --> 02:17:31,798
The support and validation is real in Korea. It's crazy.

2322
02:17:31,798 --> 02:17:34,657
We're used to it now to the language and culture.

2323
02:17:34,657 --> 02:17:36,968
It just has become an everyday life thing now.

2324
02:17:36,968 --> 02:17:38,428
Please vote.

2325
02:17:38,428 --> 02:17:39,698
AQ SQUAD is amazing.

2326
02:17:39,998 --> 02:17:41,668
I'll teach you.

2327
02:17:41,938 --> 02:17:42,938
(Laughing)

2328
02:17:43,237 --> 02:17:44,868
Shake it.

2329
02:17:44,868 --> 02:17:47,077
(Laughing)

2330
02:17:47,477 --> 02:17:48,948
And then, "I love you."

2331
02:17:48,948 --> 02:17:50,248
- I love you! - I love you!

2332
02:17:50,248 --> 02:17:51,378
I love you!

2333
02:17:51,778 --> 02:17:54,778
Korea will be remembered for the culture...

2334
02:17:54,778 --> 02:17:57,788
and just the liveliness of it.

2335
02:17:57,788 --> 02:18:00,487
Everyone is very happy. Everyone is very nice.

2336
02:18:00,487 --> 02:18:03,058
I think I'm going to miss the kindness of the people.

2337
02:18:03,058 --> 02:18:04,588
I've been saying this every single time.

2338
02:18:04,588 --> 02:18:07,758
Being surrounded by that many fans and stuff and the type of...

2339
02:18:08,397 --> 02:18:09,868
I don't know. I felt like...

2340
02:18:10,498 --> 02:18:12,638
Our fans are the ones that ride for us.

2341
02:18:12,638 --> 02:18:14,737
It's not like, "I like them." It's like, "I love you."

2342
02:18:15,438 --> 02:18:17,608
And there was another handmade drawing.

2343
02:18:17,608 --> 02:18:19,608
She's so talented too.

2344
02:18:19,608 --> 02:18:20,737
Yes. That's crazy.

2345
02:18:20,737 --> 02:18:22,248
(Handmade drawings made by the MOTIV fans)

2346
02:18:22,577 --> 02:18:23,878
We should put it up at the studio.

2347
02:18:24,147 --> 02:18:25,647
It's just so nice.

2348
02:18:26,018 --> 02:18:27,477
They're so supportive...

2349
02:18:27,477 --> 02:18:29,618
and we're so lucky to have them.

2350
02:18:29,618 --> 02:18:32,157
- It's purely out of their hearts. - Yes.

2351
02:18:32,157 --> 02:18:34,558
Have a look at them and some photos.

2352
02:18:34,558 --> 02:18:35,688
Gosh!

2353
02:18:35,688 --> 02:18:36,688
(A big pile of their hearts)

2354
02:18:36,958 --> 02:18:38,258
I'm a fan!

2355
02:18:38,698 --> 02:18:41,298
(The signature vote song with a fan)

2356
02:18:41,498 --> 02:18:44,198
We're so grateful for all their love.

2357
02:18:45,468 --> 02:18:47,567
Thank you so much. Thank you.

2358
02:18:50,067 --> 02:18:54,438
I felt a great sense of warmth and was always encouraged.

2359
02:18:54,438 --> 02:18:55,678
Thank you so much.

2360
02:18:55,848 --> 02:18:57,548
What we've achieved...

2361
02:18:57,548 --> 02:18:59,048
is meeting the Midoris.

2362
02:18:59,048 --> 02:19:00,948
(You're right.)

2363
02:19:00,948 --> 02:19:05,358
We felt really happy to meet a lot of Midoris.

2364
02:19:05,358 --> 02:19:07,518
It was like the Midoris...

2365
02:19:07,518 --> 02:19:11,458
joined the OSAKA Ojo Gang as a crew member.

2366
02:19:11,458 --> 02:19:14,928
It feels so special to be seen by someone who...

2367
02:19:14,928 --> 02:19:17,298
doesn't come from the same cultural background.

2368
02:19:17,298 --> 02:19:19,897
I feel something when they look at the work that we do.

2369
02:19:20,768 --> 02:19:24,338
I think in Korea they appreciate the talent.

2370
02:19:25,138 --> 02:19:28,647
They enjoy the craft and dancing that we give.

2371
02:19:28,948 --> 02:19:30,808
It makes me want to do even more.

2372
02:19:31,748 --> 02:19:34,577
Thank you!

2373
02:19:35,647 --> 02:19:38,018
(What is WSWF to me?)

2374
02:19:38,418 --> 02:19:41,618
For me, Aaliyah, World of Street Woman Fighter...

2375
02:19:42,028 --> 02:19:43,487
is just the beginning.

2376
02:19:44,157 --> 02:19:47,727
A platform and a voice that we haven't had before.

2377
02:19:47,798 --> 02:19:49,898
It was a challenge that I worked hard to prepare for.

2378
02:19:50,098 --> 02:19:53,438
I think I've become stronger after being on this show.

2379
02:19:53,868 --> 02:19:55,768
I thought I was going to give up,

2380
02:19:55,768 --> 02:19:59,178
and this show gave me the opportunity.

2381
02:19:59,438 --> 02:20:02,978
It just reminded me why I love dancing so much.

2382
02:20:02,978 --> 02:20:04,748
It's just like another chance.

2383
02:20:04,908 --> 02:20:07,718
I would like to say thank you so much, South Korea,

2384
02:20:07,718 --> 02:20:10,288
for the amazing new experiences...

2385
02:20:10,288 --> 02:20:13,858
that I'll never be able to compare to anywhere else.

2386
02:20:14,418 --> 02:20:18,028
(They give their all to slowly write their last farewell messages.)

2387
02:20:18,828 --> 02:20:20,098
Thank you, Korea!

2388
02:20:20,098 --> 02:20:21,158
Thank you, Korea!

2389
02:20:21,158 --> 02:20:22,568
Thank you, Korea!

2390
02:20:22,568 --> 02:20:25,068
Goodbye, World of Street Woman Fighter.

2391
02:20:25,438 --> 02:20:27,068
Goodbye, WSWF!

2392
02:20:27,968 --> 02:20:28,968
Thank you.

2393
02:20:29,438 --> 02:20:30,868
Thank you, Korea!

2394
02:20:30,868 --> 02:20:32,878
Goodbye, World of Street Woman Fighter.

2395
02:20:32,878 --> 02:20:34,438
And thank you!

2396
02:20:34,438 --> 02:20:37,148
(Thank you!)

2397
02:20:41,818 --> 02:20:44,588
Starting with the No Respect World Battle,

2398
02:20:44,818 --> 02:20:48,088
there was the Class Mission, the World of K-pop Mission,

2399
02:20:48,088 --> 02:20:49,688
the Mega Crew Mission,

2400
02:20:49,858 --> 02:20:52,028
the Global Artist Performance Mission,

2401
02:20:52,028 --> 02:20:53,398
and the Dance Film Mission.

2402
02:20:53,928 --> 02:20:57,198
And now, there's today's live finals.

2403
02:20:57,868 --> 02:20:59,868
They have fought competitively...

2404
02:20:59,868 --> 02:21:02,408
and have filled the stage more than anyone else.

2405
02:21:02,568 --> 02:21:05,708
These three crews have gone through so much.

2406
02:21:12,018 --> 02:21:14,648
Team Australia, AG SQUAD.

2407
02:21:21,658 --> 02:21:23,588
Team USA, MOTIV.

2408
02:21:27,098 --> 02:21:28,098
Hey, girls!

2409
02:21:28,398 --> 02:21:30,798
Team Japan, Osaka Ojo Gang.

2410
02:21:35,408 --> 02:21:38,568
Out of these three crews, the winning crew will be decided...

2411
02:21:38,568 --> 02:21:40,038
by 30 percent...

2412
02:21:40,038 --> 02:21:43,208
of the early voting of the Final Crew Cheer Theme,

2413
02:21:43,348 --> 02:21:45,518

02:21:45,918 --> 02:21:49,948
and the final stage bonus points.

2415
02:21:57,258 --> 02:22:00,198
Here are the total votes of the real-time voting.

2416
02:22:00,358 --> 02:22:02,968
Including the Real-Time Global Online Voting...

2417
02:22:02,968 --> 02:22:06,238
and the Real-Time Text Voting,

2418
02:22:07,338 --> 02:22:11,268
the total number of votes is 285,324.

2419
02:22:12,008 --> 02:22:14,738
We would like to deeply thank our global fans...

2420
02:22:14,738 --> 02:22:17,178
for their great love and support.

2421
02:22:20,518 --> 02:22:23,918
And now, the final ranking...

2422
02:22:24,218 --> 02:22:26,758
of World of Street Woman Fighter will be revealed.

2423
02:22:33,298 --> 02:22:36,828
The crew that placed 3rd will be announced 1st.

2424
02:22:38,698 --> 02:22:41,668
The members of this crew proved their skills...

2425
02:22:41,668 --> 02:22:43,408
with great performances.

2426
02:22:43,408 --> 02:22:46,208
They made their presence known on the stage.

2427
02:22:47,138 --> 02:22:49,808
Through every performance, they showed off great styles...

2428
02:22:49,808 --> 02:22:51,348
and fluid teamwork.

2429
02:22:51,348 --> 02:22:53,178
While keeping the color of the crew,

2430
02:22:53,178 --> 02:22:56,188
they were able to display a wide range of dancing.

2431
02:23:00,558 --> 02:23:04,588
World of Street Woman Fighter. The crew in third place.

2432
02:23:23,908 --> 02:23:25,848
Thank you so much.

2433
02:23:25,978 --> 02:23:29,518
It's Team USA, MOTIV.

2434
02:23:32,048 --> 02:23:36,658
(World of Street Woman Fighter, 3rd place crew, MOTIV)

2435
02:23:43,098 --> 02:23:45,498
- MOTIV! - MOTIV!

2436
02:23:50,768 --> 02:23:53,678
- MOTIV! - MOTIV!

2437
02:23:53,678 --> 02:23:58,048
In the early voting of the Final Crew Cheer Theme,

02:23:58,248 --> 02:24:00,818

I love you!

2447

The members of MOTIV showed great skills through the battles...

2448
02:24:31,648 --> 02:24:33,378
and made their presence known.

2449
02:24:33,548 --> 02:24:35,048
In the Mega Crew Mission,

2450
02:24:35,048 --> 02:24:36,618
they were overwhelming...

2451
02:24:36,618 --> 02:24:38,418
with their stage performance, message, and directing.

2452
02:24:38,418 --> 02:24:41,488
They received a great response...

2453
02:24:41,788 --> 02:24:43,858
after doing well in all aspects of the performance.

2454
02:24:44,858 --> 02:24:47,898
This crew kept a distinct color during every performance...

2455
02:24:48,128 --> 02:24:50,298
while widening up their range.

2456
02:24:54,168 --> 02:24:56,338
The leader of MOTIV, Marlee.

2457
02:24:57,138 --> 02:24:59,778
You have come through an intense journey.

2458
02:25:00,308 --> 02:25:02,008
I believe you have felt so many different emotions...

2459
02:25:02,008 --> 02:25:04,208
while participating in World of Street Woman Fighter.

2460
02:25:04,848 --> 02:25:07,248
Please tell us your thoughts.

2461
02:25:08,048 --> 02:25:11,688
I feel absolutely amazing!

2462
02:25:14,818 --> 02:25:17,958
We came on this show to represent ourselves...

2463
02:25:18,058 --> 02:25:21,258
truly and authentically like I've said before.

2464
02:25:21,358 --> 02:25:22,868
But more importantly,

2465
02:25:22,868 --> 02:25:23,968
we came on this show...

2466
02:25:23,968 --> 02:25:26,138
to show everyone that you can compete...

2467
02:25:26,138 --> 02:25:28,298
at a high level and still have fun.

2468
02:25:36,478 --> 02:25:39,448
- MOTIV! - MOTIV!

2469
02:25:39,548 --> 02:25:42,548
- MOTIV! - MOTIV!

2470
02:25:45,988 --> 02:25:47,888
Fight judge, Mike Song.

2471
02:25:48,258 --> 02:25:51,428
As the fight judge that has witnessed this crew's journey...

2472
02:25:51,428 --> 02:25:53,128
from the closest distance,

2473
02:25:53,328 --> 02:25:56,728
please feel free to tell them what you wish to tell them...

2474
02:25:56,728 --> 02:25:57,728
before they go.

2475
02:25:59,238 --> 02:26:04,108
Gosh. I'm so impressed by you.

2476
02:26:04,438 --> 02:26:07,178
I feel like that's...

2477
02:26:07,178 --> 02:26:10,708
the highest level of an adjective I can use to describe you.

2478
02:26:10,708 --> 02:26:15,748
Because going through a TV show, a dance competition TV show,

2479
02:26:15,748 --> 02:26:17,718
is a very unique experience.

2480
02:26:17,718 --> 02:26:20,088
Not many dancers know what it feels like...

2481
02:26:20,088 --> 02:26:22,188
because it's not a normal competition.

2482
02:26:22,188 --> 02:26:24,128
There are all of these other factors...

2483
02:26:24,128 --> 02:26:26,558
that change everything about it.

2484
02:26:26,558 --> 02:26:28,798
But for you guys to represent yourselves...

2485
02:26:29,098 --> 02:26:30,668
and keep your composure...

2486
02:26:30,668 --> 02:26:34,268
both on stage and off stage the way that you did...

2487
02:26:34,268 --> 02:26:36,968
throughout this entire season... That's masterful.

2488
02:26:37,008 --> 02:26:41,008
That's in the game of doing dance TV shows...

2489
02:26:41,008 --> 02:26:43,148
which is its own other game.

2490
02:26:43,148 --> 02:26:45,008
You guys killed that.

2491
02:26:45,048 --> 02:26:46,448
You killed that.

2492
02:26:46,648 --> 02:26:49,418
You did every challenge to perfection.

2493
02:26:49,948 --> 02:26:52,388
I really feel like you guys had a flawless run.

2494
02:26:52,388 --> 02:26:53,718
If you were to go back...

2495
02:26:53,718 --> 02:26:57,088
and look at every single challenge that you guys did,

2496
02:26:57,088 --> 02:26:59,798
I really feel like you guys hit it out the ballpark.

2497
02:26:59,898 --> 02:27:03,828
Battles, freestyles, choreo, Class Missions, and all that.

2498
02:27:03,828 --> 02:27:06,938
So congratulations. You've represented...

2499
02:27:06,938 --> 02:27:09,568
the country. You've represented the US!

2500
02:27:09,968 --> 02:27:11,808
And you went deeper with that.

2501
02:27:12,068 --> 02:27:15,538
You said something so deep that's going to be timeless!

2502
02:27:15,778 --> 02:27:20,418
Come on! And you used this platform, budget, and production to do so.

2503
02:27:20,418 --> 02:27:22,178
Let's go!

2504
02:27:24,318 --> 02:27:25,418
Congrats!

2505
02:27:28,718 --> 02:27:30,058
Thank you for that.

2506
02:27:30,058 --> 02:27:32,358
Well done, MOTIV.

2507
02:27:37,498 --> 02:27:39,338
World of Street Woman Fighter.

2508
02:27:39,338 --> 02:27:42,168
While the whole world is watching,

2509
02:27:42,168 --> 02:27:46,008
there is one last step left to become the winner.

2510
02:27:54,418 --> 02:27:57,718
There are just two crews left as candidates of becoming the winner.

2511
02:27:57,918 --> 02:28:01,418
The two crews left are Team Australia, AG SQUAD...

2512
02:28:01,658 --> 02:28:04,588
and Team Japan, OSAKA Ojo Gang.

2513
02:28:07,128 --> 02:28:08,758
Out of these two crews,

2514
02:28:08,758 --> 02:28:11,398
the final winner of World of Street Woman Fighter...

2515
02:28:11,398 --> 02:28:12,768
will be announced.

2516
02:28:13,668 --> 02:28:16,668
These two crews represented their countries on stage...

2517
02:28:16,668 --> 02:28:18,968
and left a great impact during each mission...

2518
02:28:18,968 --> 02:28:20,908
with their unique styles.

2519
02:28:20,908 --> 02:28:23,578
They endlessly overcame their limits.

2520
02:28:24,348 --> 02:28:27,878
Out of AG SQUAD and OSAKA Ojo Gang,

2521
02:28:27,878 --> 02:28:30,818
the World-Class Title...

2522
02:28:30,818 --> 02:28:33,518
and spot for Global Champion...

2523
02:28:33,688 --> 02:28:35,988
will be given to just one crew.

2524
02:28:40,358 --> 02:28:43,528
There was the early voting for the Final Crew Cheer Theme.

2525
02:28:43,528 --> 02:28:45,398
Based on the Global Public Evaluation,

2526
02:28:45,398 --> 02:28:50,908
OSAKA Ojo Gang placed 1st and received 30 percent.

2527
02:28:51,238 --> 02:28:54,038
For the World Finale with JYP performance,

2528
02:28:54,038 --> 02:28:57,878
AG SQUAD was chosen to win the bonus points.

2529
02:29:00,978 --> 02:29:04,748
For the early voting of the Final Crew Cheer Theme,

2530
02:29:05,288 --> 02:29:07,258
AG SQUAD placed second...

2531
02:29:07,258 --> 02:29:09,658
and OSAKA Ojo Gang placed first.

2532
02:29:09,688 --> 02:29:11,888
It was a very tight competition.

2533
02:29:13,758 --> 02:29:16,368
AG SQUAD's leader, Kaea.

2534
02:29:16,868 --> 02:29:19,268
How do you feel right now?

2535
02:29:21,698 --> 02:29:22,768
Gosh.

2536
02:29:24,608 --> 02:29:26,138
I'm pretty speechless.

2537
02:29:26,908 --> 02:29:30,448
We are just very excited, very nervous,

2538
02:29:30,448 --> 02:29:32,918
and just very anxious to see what happens.

2539
02:29:34,018 --> 02:29:37,248
But you know, we... I don't know.

2540
02:29:37,688 --> 02:29:41,358
We really put our hearts and souls into every single mission we did,

2541
02:29:41,358 --> 02:29:46,128
and we hope it worked, and we get to take that trophy home...

2542
02:29:46,128 --> 02:29:48,828
because we worked so hard.

2543
02:29:49,428 --> 02:29:52,598
And massive love to our MOTIV girls.

2544
02:29:52,968 --> 02:29:57,338
You ladies inspire so much. Massive shoutout to you girls.

2545
02:29:57,938 --> 02:29:59,978
All right. Thank you.

2546
02:30:04,708 --> 02:30:08,048
Up next, OSAKA Ojo Gang's leader, Ibuki.

2547
02:30:08,818 --> 02:30:10,888
How do you feel right now?

2548
02:30:11,588 --> 02:30:14,658
My heart is really pounding.

2549
02:30:14,658 --> 02:30:16,928
There were a lot of missions,

2550
02:30:17,028 --> 02:30:20,758
but I had the most fun today as part of OSAKA Ojo Gang.

2551
02:30:20,958 --> 02:30:24,268
I believe that we did our best up until now,

2552
02:30:24,268 --> 02:30:27,138
so I will have no regrets based on any result.

2553
02:30:27,298 --> 02:30:30,938
I do want to finish with a win, but let's see what will happen.

2554
02:30:30,938 --> 02:30:31,968
Thank you.

2555
02:30:36,978 --> 02:30:39,778
AG SQUAD participated to represent Australia.

2556
02:30:39,778 --> 02:30:42,988
With their explosive energy and global styles,

2557
02:30:42,988 --> 02:30:45,048
the members displayed outstanding performances...

2558
02:30:45,048 --> 02:30:47,718
throughout the whole journey of World of Street Woman Fighter.

2559
02:30:48,118 --> 02:30:49,888
During the semi-final mission,

2560
02:30:49,888 --> 02:30:54,228
they placed first in the Global Public Evaluation.

2561
02:30:54,228 --> 02:30:58,498
They became the first finalists with a perfect score.

2562
02:30:58,898 --> 02:31:03,638
This crew proved their skills and presence through all performances.

2563
02:31:05,008 --> 02:31:08,878
OSAKA Ojo Gang participated to represent Japan.

2564
02:31:09,038 --> 02:31:11,778
With their unique performances and teamwork,

2565
02:31:11,908 --> 02:31:13,948
the members of this crew...

2566
02:31:13,948 --> 02:31:16,518
consistently showed growth and change throughout the show.

2567
02:31:16,988 --> 02:31:21,058
They kept their unique color based on street dancing.

2568
02:31:21,058 --> 02:31:23,658
And during the Dance Film Mission,

2569
02:31:23,658 --> 02:31:26,628
they placed first in the Global Public Evaluation.

2570
02:31:26,628 --> 02:31:30,898
They made themselves known after taking the main part.

World of Street Woman Fighter gets announced.

2589
02:33:30,888 --> 02:33:34,388
Before I announce the winner, we have Park Jin Young with us...

2590
02:33:34,388 --> 02:33:36,288
who has been with us until the very last moment.

2591
02:33:36,688 --> 02:33:38,458
Please feel free to say a word...

2592
02:33:38,458 --> 02:33:42,298
to the last two crews that are here.

2593
02:33:43,728 --> 02:33:46,168
I'm sure the members of both crews are feeling very nervous,

2594
02:33:46,168 --> 02:33:48,968
but I believe all of the viewers of the show...

2595
02:33:49,508 --> 02:33:54,378
will congratulate and thank both teams the same way.

2596
02:33:54,378 --> 02:33:58,748
Congratulations on making it this far.

2597
02:33:59,008 --> 02:34:02,048
I really want to thank all of you. I want to thank you...

2598
02:34:02,618 --> 02:34:04,648
because you all worked so hard.

2599
02:34:04,918 --> 02:34:08,718
I felt worried as you all worked so hard to exhaustion.

2600
02:34:09,018 --> 02:34:12,328
I'd like to thank you all for working so hard...

2601
02:34:12,528 --> 02:34:15,728
while including the hearts of the viewers as well.

2602
02:34:15,728 --> 02:34:17,328
I'd like to thank you.

2603
02:34:21,198 --> 02:34:24,438
For all dancers who went beyond Korea...

2604
02:34:24,538 --> 02:34:28,108
and fought in the global dance scene,

2605
02:34:28,108 --> 02:34:30,108
thank you for your hard work.

2606
02:34:31,648 --> 02:34:36,148
At this moment, AG SQUAD and OSAKA Ojo Gang...

2607
02:34:36,148 --> 02:34:38,748
must be more nervous than anyone else.

2608
02:34:39,658 --> 02:34:42,388
In this journey, both crews...

2609
02:34:42,388 --> 02:34:45,028
proved that they had what it took to be the world-class crews...

2610
02:34:45,028 --> 02:34:48,698
with their skills, passion, and teamwork.
