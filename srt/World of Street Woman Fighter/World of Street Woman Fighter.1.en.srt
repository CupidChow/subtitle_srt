You can't take this from us. We won't let you.

In 2022, Street Man Fighter.

6
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:03,150
- I'll be taking this.
- Who is the street king?

7
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:05,750
In 2023, Street Woman Fighter 2.

8
00:01:05,751 --> 00:01:08,691

00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:10,321
In 2025,

10
00:01:10,661 --> 00:01:13,490
the global dance competition finally begins.

11
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:14,531
(The global dance battle is about to unfold.)

00:01:16,631 --> 00:01:18,401
World of Street Woman Fighter.

13
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:22,241
A battle between the world’s top female dancers.

00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:26,271
It's all happening right here, in South Korea.

15
00:01:27,141 --> 00:01:28,311
Gosh.

16
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:29,711
This is epic.

17
00:01:30,911 --> 00:01:32,351
It's on a whole new level now.

18
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,551
The competition is fiercer than ever.

19
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:37,390
- Look up!
- This place is on another level.

20
00:01:37,391 --> 00:01:38,721
Let's win this!

21
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:42,421
A battle hotter than ever before is set to unfold on this very stage.

Mnet's third dance competition for female dancers...

23
00:01:46,091 --> 00:01:48,631
is the World Battle.

24
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:51,030
- The world's best dancers.
- We're top-tier dancers.

25
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:52,470
We're number one on the dance floor.

26
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:53,631
We're champions.

27
00:01:53,871 --> 00:01:55,141
They're living legends.

28
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:57,940
You've got a lot of battle dancers, you've got a lot of choreographers,

29
00:01:57,941 --> 00:01:59,871
and you've got the max of everything.

30
00:02:02,181 --> 00:02:05,251
Australia is going to show you how we do it down under.

31
00:02:05,781 --> 00:02:08,850
Team Japan. RHTokyo...

32
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:10,851
will win 100 percent.

33
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:16,421
- We got that US flavor.
- We got that US flavor.

34
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:22,000
Osaka is number one. Don't underestimate us!

35
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:23,061
Osaka is the best.

36
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:25,931
I'm a proud Korean dancer.

37
00:02:26,171 --> 00:02:28,400
They're at the birthplace of K-pop.

38
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:29,541
We have to show them as Korean dancers.

39
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:34,210
New Zealand is being represented by ROYAL FAMILY.

40
00:02:34,211 --> 00:02:35,410
Period.

41
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:37,480
Team New Zealand is ready to eat up...

42
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:38,611
all the crews.

43
00:02:40,821 --> 00:02:42,850
Out of the six crews representing their countries,

44
00:02:42,851 --> 00:02:44,550
only one can...

45
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:46,121
can rule the world.

46
00:02:46,651 --> 00:02:49,490
World of Street Woman Fighter is supported by...

47
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:51,461
a leading K-culture brand.

48
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:54,860
The winning crew takes home a monetary award...

49
00:02:54,861 --> 00:02:58,531
and the iconic World of Street Woman Fighter champion's jewelry.

50
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm not here to have fun. I'm here to win.

51
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:04,240
We just need to be the best at this challenge.

52
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:05,671
We need to.

53
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:08,241
Let's do this, then.

54
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:09,640
Let's go!

55
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:10,880
Are you really that good?

56
00:03:10,881 --> 00:03:12,410
Do you really deserve that recognition?

57
00:03:12,411 --> 00:03:14,420
Shut it and watch me.

58
00:03:14,421 --> 00:03:15,781
We need to go hard.

59
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:18,750
Isn't that too soft? It’s not every day we’re on the world stage.

60
00:03:18,751 --> 00:03:20,090
I actually don't want to battle anyone...

61
00:03:20,091 --> 00:03:21,361
because none of you are good.

62
00:03:21,561 --> 00:03:22,561
You should focus on your own team.

63
00:03:22,562 --> 00:03:24,661
Your mouth is moving a lot like a rat.

64
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,090
I think they're washed up.

65
00:03:26,091 --> 00:03:27,431
You can't fake it in dance.

66
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:29,930
- They completely blew it.
- Yes.

67
00:03:29,931 --> 00:03:31,830
It's a global embarrassment.

68
00:03:31,831 --> 00:03:33,371
I want to kill them!

69
00:03:33,931 --> 00:03:35,941
I'm trying really hard.

70
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:39,470
They made us look like fools.

71
00:03:39,471 --> 00:03:40,540
Everybody's trash.

72
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,410
They crushed our pride.

73
00:03:42,411 --> 00:03:44,410
Who called us fools?

74
00:03:44,411 --> 00:03:46,050
How can I call myself a dancer here?

75
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:47,281
I end up doubting myself.

76
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:49,920
Let's take them all down.

77
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:52,121
Yes, we should do that.

78
00:03:52,521 --> 00:03:53,821
We want a rematch.

79
00:03:56,121 --> 00:03:57,291
Right now.

80
00:03:58,461 --> 00:03:59,831
We need to fight harder.

81
00:04:00,861 --> 00:04:02,531
We need to want this more.

82
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:06,170
- The standard now is just...
- Winning.

83
00:04:06,171 --> 00:04:07,701
- Winning.
- Winning.

84
00:04:08,641 --> 00:04:11,141
Only one crew can become the ultimate winner.

85
00:04:11,511 --> 00:04:14,411
Who will emerge as...

86
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:16,041
the true global champion?

87
00:04:21,351 --> 00:04:22,421
Ready?

88
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:26,751
Fight!

89
00:04:28,921 --> 00:04:31,031
(World of Street Woman Fighter)

90
00:04:54,981 --> 00:04:58,021
(World of Street Woman Fighter)

91
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,490
(Bukseong-dong, Jung-gu, Incheon)

92
00:05:01,491 --> 00:05:03,221
Let's go. Day one.

93
00:05:03,361 --> 00:05:05,090
Today is the day.

94
00:05:05,091 --> 00:05:06,631
I'm looking forward to this. We're going to fight.

95
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:08,760
We're here to fight.

96
00:05:08,761 --> 00:05:10,970
We're about to show them what Australia is about.

97
00:05:10,971 --> 00:05:12,130
Yes, I can't wait.

98
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:14,440
Something they've never seen before.

99
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:17,300
That power from down under.

100
00:05:17,301 --> 00:05:19,370
AG SQUAD.

101
00:05:19,371 --> 00:05:21,110
We are AG SQUAD.

102
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:23,681
- All in Aus.
- All in Aus.

103
00:05:23,841 --> 00:05:26,680
The reaction of the other crews about us.

104
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:27,781
Surprise.

105
00:05:29,251 --> 00:05:31,590
If you hear the name ROYAL FAMILY,

106
00:05:31,591 --> 00:05:34,490
you'll automatically think of the main girls,

107
00:05:34,491 --> 00:05:36,620
which is Kaea, Ruthy, Kyra.

108
00:05:36,621 --> 00:05:37,961
(Ruthy Baby, Kaea, Kyra)

109
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:41,330
We have had a history together with the ROYAL FAMILY dance crew.

110
00:05:41,331 --> 00:05:42,761
And then now we're here.

111
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:45,501
We came here to win. We're not playing.

112
00:05:45,631 --> 00:05:47,470
Ruthy Baby, Kyra.

113
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:50,600
And then we have afro, fusion, heels,

114
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,741
tomboy gangster. We've got hip-hop.

115
00:05:53,341 --> 00:05:55,480
- Fire from down under.
- Fire.

116
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:57,041
- Down under.
- Yes.

117
00:05:57,511 --> 00:06:00,680
Today starts from when we walk up those steps, guys.

118
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:02,080
This is where it's all starting.

119
00:06:02,081 --> 00:06:04,290
- We're entering the fight club.
- Here we go.

120
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,621
- The global fight club.
- We've got to fight.

121
00:06:06,691 --> 00:06:09,160
- Gosh.
- Look at that.

122
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,720
So cute.

123
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:12,690
- Fight zone.
- Crew Agit.

124
00:06:12,691 --> 00:06:14,260
They've got different colors.

125
00:06:14,261 --> 00:06:17,100
- The HQ.
- It's our relaxing lounge.

126
00:06:17,101 --> 00:06:19,231
That one's really giving me "Squid Game" vibes.

127
00:06:19,931 --> 00:06:21,170
Crew signs are on them.

128
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:22,470
"Crowns up."

129
00:06:22,471 --> 00:06:23,670
"Mek it bums up."

130
00:06:23,671 --> 00:06:26,410
"Gang's spirit, queen's move."

131
00:06:26,411 --> 00:06:27,680
- Beware.
- Who is it?

132
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:29,810
- Japan.
- Ojo Gang.

133
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:32,180
- Ojo Gang.
- I like how it says "Osaka."

134
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:33,610
Let's take out "Ojo" in the middle.

135
00:06:33,611 --> 00:06:34,881
We should just call ourselves Osaka Gang.

136
00:06:35,951 --> 00:06:37,480
Since we have "gang" in our name,

137
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,920
we wouldn't seem peaceful, right?

138
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:41,821
I don't think anyone will approach us.

139
00:06:42,091 --> 00:06:43,621
(The second crew is giving off major gangster vibes.)

140
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:45,630
We're a dance crew from Osaka,

141
00:06:45,631 --> 00:06:49,531
so we're participating under the name, "OSAKA Ojo Gang."

142
00:06:49,601 --> 00:06:52,430
When it comes to the basics of dance, it's got to be Osaka.

143
00:06:52,431 --> 00:06:56,971
Osaka is a region famous for dance, even in Japan.

144
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:58,910
Osaka is famous for old school.

145
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:00,470
It's famous for street dance.

146
00:07:00,471 --> 00:07:01,840
Osaka dancers are strong in battles.

147
00:07:01,841 --> 00:07:03,680
Regardless of who I'm up against, I'm confident I'll win.

148
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:05,511
Anyone can feel free to challenge me to a battle.

149
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:08,280
(The leader of Ojo Gang)

150
00:07:08,281 --> 00:07:10,320
(Ibuki, the Queen of Waaking)

151
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:12,520
I've entered more battles than I can count.

152
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:14,420
I've won a lot of them too.

153
00:07:14,421 --> 00:07:16,390
Ibuki.

154
00:07:16,391 --> 00:07:18,361
(Japan's number 1 waaking queen, Ibuki)

155
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:20,430
(She's not the only one with dance battle experience.)

156
00:07:20,431 --> 00:07:22,730
(Kyoka, the hip-hop scene legend)

157
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:25,330
I hate losing. That's it. It's the only thing I've got to say.

158
00:07:25,331 --> 00:07:27,070
(She entered the global hip-hop battle Juste Debout 2016 at age 19.)

159
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,800
(Kyoka earned the title of world number 1 in hip-hop.)

160
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:31,340
In terms of battle,

161
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:33,171
there's nothing for me to be scared about.

162
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:35,180
Kyoka is the best dancer in the hip-hop scene.

163
00:07:35,181 --> 00:07:36,511
She never loses a battle.

164
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:39,750
All of our crew members are essential to our victory.

165
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:43,980
We've gathered the best dancers from each genre.

166
00:07:43,981 --> 00:07:46,350
("We're the Osaka Avengers.")

167
00:07:46,351 --> 00:07:49,161
Osaka is number one in the world. Don't underestimate us!

168
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:51,961
We have to scare them during the battles.

169
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:54,801
You're scaring me.

170
00:07:55,061 --> 00:07:56,900
Sparks are going to fly.

171
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:58,001
Especially with Korea.

172
00:07:58,201 --> 00:07:59,800
Since this is the third season,

173
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:02,071
their energy is going to be really intense.

174
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:03,700
- It's all about the spirit.
- Yes.

175
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:05,140
Let's go.

176
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:06,510
I can't believe we're doing this again.

177
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:08,740
It's as if we're rejoining the military.

178
00:08:08,741 --> 00:08:11,351
Are we insane to do this again?

179
00:08:11,581 --> 00:08:14,880
- World of Street Woman Fighter.
- World of Street Woman Fighter!

180
00:08:14,881 --> 00:08:16,180
Let's hold hands.

181
00:08:16,181 --> 00:08:17,820
Gosh, the crew names are on here.

182
00:08:17,821 --> 00:08:20,050
Australia, USA, Japan.

183
00:08:20,051 --> 00:08:22,861
Walk all over them!

184
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,290
Walk all over them. Do you get it?

185
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,391
(Gabee is referring to what Ri.hey said in Season 1.)

186
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:30,360
- Gosh, a tiger.
- Gosh, it's Bangall the tiger.

187
00:08:30,361 --> 00:08:32,370
A stuffed tiger. I got chills.

188
00:08:32,371 --> 00:08:35,071
It's small. It's a tiger cub.

189
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:37,441
- With the tiger's spirit, BUMSUP.
- With the tiger's spirit, BUMSUP.

190
00:08:38,441 --> 00:08:39,441
(Roar)

191
00:08:39,442 --> 00:08:40,771
Hello, we're BUMSUP.

192
00:08:40,841 --> 00:08:44,411
This is our first time being on one team.

193
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:47,010
There’s a reason we made history with "Hey Mama."

194
00:08:47,011 --> 00:08:49,581
We were the stars of Season One.

195
00:08:50,221 --> 00:08:51,450
(Korean dancers...)

196
00:08:51,451 --> 00:08:53,390
(have been ready for a long time.)

197
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:55,260
We're going to take everyone down.

198
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:58,061
We'll show them the heat Koreans bring.

199
00:08:58,231 --> 00:09:00,530
This is what heat is all about.

200
00:09:00,531 --> 00:09:03,400
The leaders of 8 crews from the 1st season are on 1 team.

201
00:09:03,401 --> 00:09:04,830
There's no way we'd lose.

202
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:06,530
We want to prove ourselves globally.

203
00:09:06,531 --> 00:09:09,141
We’ll set the bar so high you won’t even see it.

204
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,611
Welcome to Korea.

205
00:09:12,071 --> 00:09:13,911
And let's go.

206
00:09:14,611 --> 00:09:16,780
If they're referencing Season One...

207
00:09:16,781 --> 00:09:18,451
- How many years ago was that?
- Yes.

208
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,610
Time has passed.

209
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:21,680
Let's move forward.

210
00:09:21,681 --> 00:09:23,880
This isn't also Korea versus Korea.

211
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:25,590
- It's versus the world, right?
- Yes.

212
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:26,920
Hip-hop dance.

213
00:09:26,921 --> 00:09:27,921
Where is it from?

214
00:09:27,922 --> 00:09:30,721
- Where did hip-hop originate?
- That's right.

215
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:33,530
- US...
- A.

216
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,130
USA.

217
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:36,561
That's where it came from.

218
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:38,500
This is exciting.

219
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:40,330
I can't even lie. Like, this is really exciting.

220
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:42,271
(I'm excited.)

221
00:09:42,671 --> 00:09:44,470
(She suddenly pulls a straight face.)

222
00:09:44,471 --> 00:09:46,811
- We're here.
- People are coming down.

223
00:09:46,971 --> 00:09:49,010
I made it to World of Street Woman Fighter!

224
00:09:49,011 --> 00:09:50,681
They're making noise.

225
00:09:50,781 --> 00:09:53,581
- Where's the baddie at?
- What's up, baddies?

226
00:09:55,521 --> 00:09:57,180
We have arrived.

227
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:58,890
We're here to stay. Period.

228
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:01,091
- Oh, cute.
- Oh, my gosh. Look.

229
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:05,361
Brother. We should've worn something like this, brother.

230
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:06,690
I love that.

231
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:08,301
This is so...

232
00:10:09,101 --> 00:10:10,431
DJ, pump it up.

233
00:10:10,761 --> 00:10:12,631
You've got to scream.

234
00:10:12,731 --> 00:10:14,200
I think I'm going to try this.

235
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:15,840
Are you guys stealing snacks already?

236
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:17,100
Yes, I'm hungry.

237
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:18,711
- Coconut.
- Crackers.

238
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:19,811
I'm thirsty.

239
00:10:20,111 --> 00:10:21,580
(Welcome, regulars-to-be.)

240
00:10:21,581 --> 00:10:23,911
Girls, let's go over there.

241
00:10:24,011 --> 00:10:25,751
- Look.
- How cute.

242
00:10:26,351 --> 00:10:29,421
It's so pink! Yes!

243
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:32,290
- We are ROYAL FAMILY.
- ROYAL FAMILY.

244
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,791
- Crowns up!
- Crowns up!

245
00:10:34,961 --> 00:10:36,621
(1st place at the 2011 World Hip-Hop Dance Championship)

246
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:38,230
(1st place at the 2012 World Hip-Hop Dance Championship)

247
00:10:38,231 --> 00:10:40,430
We're three-time world champions.

248
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,300
No one better represents New Zealand better than ROYAL FAMILY.

249
00:10:43,301 --> 00:10:44,771
(An unrivaled dance crew that represents New Zealand)

250
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:48,841
So our main style... We're bringing polyswagg...

251
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:50,840
which combines the foundations...

252
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:53,041
of hip-hop and street dance with Polynesian twists.

253
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,840
Parris Goebel creates iconic moves.

254
00:10:55,841 --> 00:10:59,110
We've worked with Rihanna, Ciara for "Level Up,"

255
00:10:59,111 --> 00:11:01,620
Justin Bieber, Jennifer Lopez, CL,

256
00:11:01,621 --> 00:11:03,781
Lady Gaga, and Doja Cat.

257
00:11:03,881 --> 00:11:05,620
(ROYAL FAMILY is the number 1 crew the world-renowned artists want.)

258
00:11:05,621 --> 00:11:07,861
To name a few black goddesses.

259
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:10,291
Our name is the biggest right now.

260
00:11:10,391 --> 00:11:12,231
We have a lot of expectations.

261
00:11:12,991 --> 00:11:16,261
But we're like the next generation of ROYAL FAMILY that's coming up.

262
00:11:16,361 --> 00:11:18,530
We're hoping to make a name for ourselves.

263
00:11:18,531 --> 00:11:21,540
So we're just excited to show the world the rise...

264
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,070
of this next generation.

265
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:25,340
- We're ready to eat.
- We're ready to eat.

266
00:11:25,341 --> 00:11:27,411
No crumbs. Period.

267
00:11:27,711 --> 00:11:28,741
Yummy.

268
00:11:29,511 --> 00:11:30,511
Wait. Are they here?

269
00:11:30,611 --> 00:11:32,610
Yes, everyone's here except for that team.

270
00:11:32,611 --> 00:11:34,011
Are there two teams from Japan?

271
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:35,220
Are there two?

272
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:37,481
Osaka and Tokyo?

273
00:11:37,581 --> 00:11:38,821
They are here.

274
00:11:39,521 --> 00:11:40,620
OSAKA Ojo Gang is here.

275
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:41,720
RHTokyo isn't here yet.

276
00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:42,791
There are two teams from Japan, right?

277
00:11:42,991 --> 00:11:45,090
The two Japanese teams are going to be, like,

278
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:46,161
at each other, right?

279
00:11:46,361 --> 00:11:49,061
If you speak too loudly, people outside will hear you.

280
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:50,861
They won't understand us anyway.

281
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,131
We're far from the other Japanese crew.

282
00:11:54,301 --> 00:11:56,201
From which continent will the last crew be?

283
00:11:56,301 --> 00:11:58,341
Tokyo!

284
00:11:58,411 --> 00:12:00,410
- RHTokyo!
- RHTokyo!

285
00:12:00,411 --> 00:12:02,580
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

286
00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:05,581
(You can feel the Tokyo vibe from a distance.)

287
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:08,150
(The perfect teamwork)

288
00:12:08,151 --> 00:12:10,280
- Let's enjoy it. We're one.
- Let's go.

289
00:12:10,281 --> 00:12:11,951
Real hot Tokyo.

290
00:12:12,051 --> 00:12:13,490
- Hello.
- Hello.

291
00:12:13,491 --> 00:12:14,791
- RHTokyo!
- RHTokyo!

292
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:16,491
(Smiling)

293
00:12:16,492 --> 00:12:17,991
We'll dance like a charismatic girl who's making sushi.

294
00:12:18,091 --> 00:12:20,861
Then we'll wrap up like a traditional Japanese chef. Tokyo.

295
00:12:21,361 --> 00:12:23,230
Although we were born in different places,

296
00:12:23,231 --> 00:12:26,870
we came together and created a culture.

297
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,040
Tokyo is the place...

298
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,241
where you can exchange energy through dance.

299
00:12:30,441 --> 00:12:33,471
That was why the crew name became RHTokyo, Real Hot Tokyo.

300
00:12:34,711 --> 00:12:36,181
(The leader of RHTokyo, Rie Hata)

301
00:12:36,981 --> 00:12:38,810
(Rie Hata is the queen of swag.)

302
00:12:38,811 --> 00:12:42,621
She creates unique choreography no one can copy.

303
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:44,420
(Her moves are totally new...)

304
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:45,421
(and cool!)

305
00:12:45,422 --> 00:12:47,350
(They're totally addictive.)

306
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,220
(She has worked with global artists such as Chris Brown and Usher)

307
00:12:49,221 --> 00:12:51,791
(She choreographed G-DRAGON's "Power" and "Too Bad.")

308
00:12:52,461 --> 00:12:53,790
(G-DRAGON, CL, ZICO, ENHYPEN, PSY, TWICE,)

309
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,030
(BTS, BoA, EXO, Red Velvet, NCT U, NCT DREAM, NCT 127,)

310
00:12:55,031 --> 00:12:56,360
(TAEYONG, Stray Kids, ATEEZ, VIXX, HyunA, and BABYMONSTER)

311
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:59,730
I've choreographed a dance for countless songs.

312
00:12:59,731 --> 00:13:00,801
(Rie Hata is a popular choreographer all artists want to work with.)

313
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:03,070
(Reina and Ako of RHTokyo participated...)

314
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:05,041
(in Rie Hata's collaborative stage with U-KWON of Block B.)

315
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:06,470
(The promising kid dancers...)

316
00:13:06,471 --> 00:13:07,610
(grew up so much.)

317
00:13:07,611 --> 00:13:10,040
Although we first met as a teacher and a student,

318
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:14,881
they grew into professional dancers I want to dance with.

319
00:13:15,381 --> 00:13:19,920
Hello, I'm Rena of RHTokyo.

320
00:13:19,921 --> 00:13:22,390
RHTokyo is my home team.

321
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:25,861
The crew members have been my family for a long time.

322
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:27,231
So I really want to win.

323
00:13:27,861 --> 00:13:30,230
- Team Japan is here!
- Yes!

324
00:13:30,231 --> 00:13:31,671
- There's another one.
- There's another one.

325
00:13:32,331 --> 00:13:34,000
- Everyone is quiet.
- Ojo Gang.

326
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:35,041
Are they inside?

327
00:13:36,501 --> 00:13:38,741
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

328
00:13:38,811 --> 00:13:41,341
- Team Japan!
- Team Japan!

329
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:42,441
(They're here!)

330
00:13:45,151 --> 00:13:46,750
It's the first international contest in a long while.

331
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:47,911
Are they here to play?

332
00:13:48,921 --> 00:13:50,981
We're in your care.

333
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,091
Sure.

334
00:13:52,521 --> 00:13:54,351
(The 6 crews finish entering the fight club.)

335
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:56,760
You know that we'll soon see something on the screen, right?

336
00:13:56,761 --> 00:13:57,761
Boom!

337
00:13:57,762 --> 00:13:59,261
It'll go, "Estimated rankings."

338
00:13:59,531 --> 00:14:00,961
I hate that so much.

339
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:02,461
They wouldn't know, right?

340
00:14:02,561 --> 00:14:04,161
Of course not. They wouldn't know anything.

341
00:14:05,071 --> 00:14:07,201
- Something came up.
- Hold on.

342
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,340
(Startled)

343
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:11,170
"Country expected to win?"

344
00:14:11,171 --> 00:14:12,210
(What?)

345
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:13,770
We need to rank them from 1 to 6.

346
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:14,911
All of them.

347
00:14:15,011 --> 00:14:17,110
We used to get the rankings for the crews.

348
00:14:17,111 --> 00:14:19,881
- Now, they're for the countries.
- They're for the countries.

349
00:14:19,981 --> 00:14:22,151
I think it'll hurt people's pride.

350
00:14:22,351 --> 00:14:24,351
We're number one in Japan.

351
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:25,451
(I agree.)

352
00:14:25,452 --> 00:14:27,890
We'll definitely be able to win.

353
00:14:27,891 --> 00:14:29,060
I'm certain of it.

354
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:30,990
Who do we think is the first?

355
00:14:30,991 --> 00:14:32,260
Last will be...

356
00:14:32,261 --> 00:14:33,261
(What are the estimated rankings by each crew?)

357
00:14:33,961 --> 00:14:35,300
- What?
- The second crew...

358
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:36,631
that's expected to win.

359
00:14:37,231 --> 00:14:38,331
Of course.

360
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:42,471
That's Osaka. Osaka.

361
00:14:43,071 --> 00:14:44,471
(Her pride in Osaka comes from the heart.)

362
00:14:44,771 --> 00:14:48,640
It means that they have quite a lot of respect for us.

363
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:49,881
Who ranked first?

364
00:14:50,241 --> 00:14:52,651
It has to be Korea.

365
00:14:52,951 --> 00:14:54,980
The team has the leader of the winning crew,

366
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:57,020
so everyone would've chosen it.

367
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,691
So Korea wouldn't be in fourth place or something like that.

368
00:15:00,521 --> 00:15:02,620
(Country expected to win: 4th place, BUMSUP)

369
00:15:02,621 --> 00:15:03,690
We placed fourth.

370
00:15:03,691 --> 00:15:05,130
- Hold on.
- It isn't half bad.

371
00:15:05,131 --> 00:15:07,230
It's good. We didn't place sixth.

372
00:15:07,231 --> 00:15:09,900
- I thought that we'd place 6th.
- I thought that we'd place 6th.

373
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:12,170
Hold on a second! Why did you guys become so tame?

374
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:14,070
- Seriously.
- What are you guys doing?

375
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:16,140
- Hey!
- We didn't even place third!

376
00:15:16,141 --> 00:15:18,140
How is it possible that we place fourth?

377
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:20,910
It wouldn't be fun to place first from the very beginning.

378
00:15:20,911 --> 00:15:22,511
You want to create an epic drama?

379
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:26,380
We need to start from the bottom and go up.

380
00:15:26,381 --> 00:15:28,521
The 5th and 6th places will be so annoyed.

381
00:15:31,691 --> 00:15:33,721
(Chaotic)

382
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:34,860
Oh, my gosh!

383
00:15:34,861 --> 00:15:36,291
We'll be eliminated first?

384
00:15:36,391 --> 00:15:38,160
- Sixth?
- What?

385
00:15:38,161 --> 00:15:39,630
So they think that...

386
00:15:39,631 --> 00:15:41,261
we might get eliminated first.

387
00:15:41,501 --> 00:15:44,461
I think they ranked us like that because we had no battle experience.

388
00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:46,870
You guys really don't know what we've been through.

389
00:15:46,871 --> 00:15:49,041
This skin is thick!

390
00:15:49,141 --> 00:15:50,401
You're sleeping on us.

391
00:15:50,901 --> 00:15:53,210
Well, maybe they did that because they know...

392
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:55,141
that we're a threat or something.

393
00:15:55,641 --> 00:15:56,941
You all just wait.

394
00:15:58,111 --> 00:15:59,111
(Congratulations on taking 1st place.)

395
00:15:59,111 --> 00:16:00,111
Yes!

396
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:03,280
Did we place first? I got goosebumps.

397
00:16:03,281 --> 00:16:04,791
- Is that what it is?
- Yes.

398
00:16:04,891 --> 00:16:07,591
No way. Thank you.

399
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:10,661
- What?
- What?

400
00:16:10,861 --> 00:16:12,561
- What?
- Is that it?

401
00:16:12,991 --> 00:16:15,001
First place is insane.

402
00:16:15,161 --> 00:16:16,161
(What's that?)

403
00:16:16,162 --> 00:16:17,200
(Flustered)

404
00:16:17,201 --> 00:16:18,671
I should've known. Hold on.

405
00:16:20,231 --> 00:16:21,300
(Scratching)

406
00:16:21,301 --> 00:16:22,301
(Glancing over)

407
00:16:22,871 --> 00:16:24,601
(Speechless)

408
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:26,171
First place.

409
00:16:27,511 --> 00:16:29,811
Why did people think...

410
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,111
that RHTokyo was first place?

411
00:16:32,311 --> 00:16:34,051
We put them in last place.

412
00:16:35,251 --> 00:16:38,590
OSAKA Ojo Gang ranked us last, right?

413
00:16:38,591 --> 00:16:41,221
A Japanese crew did that to a Japanese crew.

414
00:16:41,591 --> 00:16:42,991
"They'll definitely place last!"

415
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:45,160
"We'll make sure of it." Did they think that?

416
00:16:45,161 --> 00:16:47,261
I think they're wary of us since we're also from Japan.

417
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,360
"A teacher and her students."

418
00:16:49,361 --> 00:16:51,571
Isn't that too much?

419
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:52,730
Do they disregard us?

420
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:54,730
(A teacher and her students. Don't lose to Rie!)

421
00:16:54,731 --> 00:16:57,971
Perhaps we have the vibe of a teacher and her students.

422
00:16:58,241 --> 00:17:00,871
But I don't act like a teacher, do I?

423
00:17:01,681 --> 00:17:02,681
Definitely not.

424
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:05,010
(Expected ranking from RHTokyo: 3rd)

425
00:17:05,011 --> 00:17:06,310
(Each member has good skills, but they're lacking as a crew.)

426
00:17:06,311 --> 00:17:07,311
How annoying.

427
00:17:07,312 --> 00:17:09,751
"But they're lacking as a crew?"

428
00:17:10,051 --> 00:17:11,281
It's such a rude thing to say.

429
00:17:11,951 --> 00:17:13,320
Are they telling us not to work as a crew?

430
00:17:13,321 --> 00:17:14,821
It means that we have no teamwork.

431
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:16,861
What a way to provoke us.

432
00:17:18,461 --> 00:17:20,530
(My arms are beginning to itch.)

433
00:17:20,531 --> 00:17:23,631
Say it once more. It motivates me.

434
00:17:24,161 --> 00:17:26,070
So we came second...

435
00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:27,071
with Ojo Gang.

436
00:17:27,231 --> 00:17:29,600
Wait. New Zealand ranked us as fifth.

437
00:17:29,601 --> 00:17:30,640
That's crazy.

438
00:17:30,641 --> 00:17:31,710
(Expected ranking from ROYAL FAMILY: 5th)

439
00:17:31,711 --> 00:17:33,810
They're like a project team that just got put together.

440
00:17:33,811 --> 00:17:35,381
- So...
- They're a project team.

441
00:17:35,811 --> 00:17:38,811
Is that how it's going to be, New Zealand? All right.

442
00:17:38,911 --> 00:17:41,720
That's what I mean. Everyone has done crew work before.

443
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:43,221
Teamwork comes naturally.

444
00:17:43,681 --> 00:17:45,920
They're underestimating us, so whatever.

445
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:47,090
Well, that's still crazy.

446
00:17:47,091 --> 00:17:49,921
They literally watched me while they were growing up.

447
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:52,860
I find that comment the most annoying.

448
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:55,230
- "The moves aren't clear." - I find that the most annoying too.

449
00:17:55,231 --> 00:17:58,370
Until when will you dance as if you're doing taekwondo?

450
00:17:58,371 --> 00:17:59,371
They should focus on themselves.

451
00:17:59,372 --> 00:18:02,471
"Get your motive from Street Woman Fighter 1?"

452
00:18:02,571 --> 00:18:06,011
I think because Team Korea is all from Season One, they're like,

453
00:18:06,111 --> 00:18:07,870
- "You can get your motive from us." - "From us."

454
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:09,011
"From us."

455
00:18:09,111 --> 00:18:10,511
But only one of them won.

456
00:18:11,081 --> 00:18:12,151
But it's Season Three.

457
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:15,880
- So they don't matter.
- Period.

458
00:18:15,881 --> 00:18:16,881
I'll be waiting.

459
00:18:17,081 --> 00:18:18,751
- Let's start there.
- Yes.

460
00:18:22,691 --> 00:18:24,891
- Now to the fight zone!
- Yes!

461
00:18:25,161 --> 00:18:27,831
It's time to go!

462
00:18:29,301 --> 00:18:30,331
Do we go to the fight zone?

463
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:33,071
We're ready to fight.

464
00:18:33,301 --> 00:18:34,731
Go!

465
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:38,000
Let's go. I'm so sorry.

466
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:39,371
(Carefree)

467
00:18:40,011 --> 00:18:41,011
I'll see you later.

468
00:18:41,611 --> 00:18:42,641
Let's do it.

469
00:18:42,741 --> 00:18:43,911
Let's gang up on them.

470
00:18:46,811 --> 00:18:48,581
(They'll have a fierce dance battle for the pride of their countries.)

471
00:18:49,381 --> 00:18:51,651
(The fight zone awaits the 6 crews from all over the world.)

472
00:19:00,531 --> 00:19:02,330
Let's go.

473
00:19:02,331 --> 00:19:03,861
Let's freaking go.

474
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:05,071
I love it.

475
00:19:05,531 --> 00:19:06,671
We're the first.

476
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,101
(We feel good!)

477
00:19:09,501 --> 00:19:11,201
(Team USA, MOTIV enters the fight zone first.)

478
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:17,941
MOTIV crew does lean into more traditional, foundational hip-hop.

479
00:19:19,281 --> 00:19:22,820
We do hip-hop dance, and hip-hop is from the US.

480
00:19:22,821 --> 00:19:26,191
I think we're the best way to introduce Team USA.

481
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,520
Hey, what's up? We are...

482
00:19:29,521 --> 00:19:31,290
- MOTIV crew.
- MOTIV crew.

483
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,790
- What's your MOTIV?
- What's your MOTIV?

484
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,061
Hi, I'm Marlee Hightower.

485
00:19:35,601 --> 00:19:38,231
MOTIV crew was formed when I was 16.

486
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:41,870
We've been on NBC's "World of Dance."

487
00:19:41,871 --> 00:19:44,070
We've been headlining "World of Dance..."

488
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:45,510
for a very long time now.

489
00:19:45,511 --> 00:19:47,311
The actual competition itself.

490
00:19:47,441 --> 00:19:50,511
(Marlee recently participated in "World of Dance" as a judge.)

491
00:19:51,711 --> 00:19:53,410
And we also have Logan,

492
00:19:53,411 --> 00:19:55,251
a world-renowned B-Girl.

493
00:19:55,651 --> 00:19:58,720
My name is Logan, aka B-Girl Logistx.

494
00:19:58,721 --> 00:20:01,220
I represent the breaking scene.

495
00:20:01,221 --> 00:20:04,661
As someone who represented America in the Summer Games just recently.

496
00:20:05,231 --> 00:20:08,961
So she's like a heavy hitter and a secret weapon for MOTIV crew.

497
00:20:10,431 --> 00:20:11,830
(Picking out No Respect Dancer for No Respect World Battle)

498
00:20:11,831 --> 00:20:13,531
Nobody breaks here except for me.

499
00:20:14,201 --> 00:20:15,800
They don't want me to pick them, I swear.

500
00:20:15,801 --> 00:20:17,171
(The composure of a national breakdancer)

501
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:19,470
What do they know about flavor Florida?

502
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:20,840
Flavor Florida.

503
00:20:20,841 --> 00:20:23,340
I'm actually happy we're the first to be here.

504
00:20:23,341 --> 00:20:24,880
- All right.
- Let's do it.

505
00:20:24,881 --> 00:20:25,881
- Let's cook.
- We should do it.

506
00:20:28,111 --> 00:20:29,520
(The evaluation video about MOTIV is played.)

507
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:31,120
- Hit that.
- Let's go.

508
00:20:31,121 --> 00:20:32,520
Okay. Let's hear it.

509
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:33,521
America?

510
00:20:33,821 --> 00:20:35,591
It's America.

511
00:20:35,961 --> 00:20:37,021
No!

512
00:20:37,121 --> 00:20:38,121
America's strong.

513
00:20:38,122 --> 00:20:39,630
They've got so much talent.

514
00:20:39,631 --> 00:20:42,731
That'll definitely be someone to look out for for us.

515
00:20:43,731 --> 00:20:44,731
I'm scared.

516
00:20:44,732 --> 00:20:46,070
(Revealing MOTIV)

517
00:20:46,071 --> 00:20:47,131
Monti?

518
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,540
- Moti?
- Hoti.

519
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,541
Mochi?

520
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:52,141
- Moti.
- Moti.

521
00:20:52,441 --> 00:20:54,111
Anyone who knows them?

522
00:20:54,941 --> 00:20:55,941
Do you all know them?

523
00:20:56,311 --> 00:20:58,180
Honestly, you've not heard of this crew before, right?

524
00:20:58,181 --> 00:20:59,650
- Be honest.
- I've never heard of them.

525
00:20:59,651 --> 00:21:00,651
Me neither.

526
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,781
Come on.

527
00:21:03,121 --> 00:21:04,750
Marlee.

528
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:07,151
This person.

529
00:21:08,421 --> 00:21:10,060
I follow her on social media.

530
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,130
(I follow her.)

531
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:13,231
She's really good.

532
00:21:13,631 --> 00:21:14,690
Is she a bad one?

533
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,201
- This hypes you up.
- Period.

534
00:21:16,461 --> 00:21:18,031
You're nasty.

535
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:20,300
(Logistx is revealed.)

536
00:21:20,301 --> 00:21:21,571
Goodness!

537
00:21:22,301 --> 00:21:24,441
How many champion titles did she win?

538
00:21:24,471 --> 00:21:26,140
She did the Summer Games breaking.

539
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:27,411
Are you kidding me?

540
00:21:27,511 --> 00:21:28,781
Logan.

541
00:21:29,511 --> 00:21:30,881
The rest of the crew members...

542
00:21:31,241 --> 00:21:32,511
The rest of the crew members...

543
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:34,580
don't have any experience.

544
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:37,281
They don't have experience in battle or choreography.

545
00:21:37,451 --> 00:21:39,690
They're like supporters.

546
00:21:39,691 --> 00:21:41,450
- No.
- Girl.

547
00:21:41,451 --> 00:21:43,190
I think this crew only has Logistix.

548
00:21:43,191 --> 00:21:44,260
- Right.
- That's what I think.

549
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,390
- She's the only scary one.
- Yes.

550
00:21:45,391 --> 00:21:47,261
Except for Logistx,

551
00:21:47,661 --> 00:21:50,001
I think it's hard to say they represent America.

552
00:21:50,331 --> 00:21:51,661
(Surprised)

553
00:21:52,031 --> 00:21:54,970
I really don't recognize anyone but B-Girl.

554
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:56,440
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yes.

555
00:21:56,441 --> 00:22:00,740
I ranked Logistx as first.

556
00:22:00,741 --> 00:22:03,211
I ranked the leader as the second.

557
00:22:04,011 --> 00:22:05,110
I am the leader,

558
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:07,650
and I know that I deserve that first-place spot.

559
00:22:07,651 --> 00:22:09,450
I'm going to show all of those girls...

560
00:22:09,451 --> 00:22:11,121
why I deserve that spot.

561
00:22:11,421 --> 00:22:13,451
I'm sorry, but you're weak, MOTIV.

562
00:22:13,951 --> 00:22:16,191
Their name is MOTIV, but they're not yet so good...

563
00:22:16,591 --> 00:22:17,591
to be my motive.

564
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:18,931
They're not yet so good.

565
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:20,091
What?

566
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:22,800
It just made me more excited to battle.

567
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:24,700
(Sighing)

568
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:25,770
I'm really mad.

569
00:22:25,771 --> 00:22:27,770
How are you going to expect so little of us...

570
00:22:27,771 --> 00:22:29,170
if you don't know us?

571
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:31,241
We'll see what happens.

572
00:22:31,671 --> 00:22:32,741
I should call them out.

573
00:22:33,141 --> 00:22:34,771
You can bring out the next crew now.

574
00:22:35,711 --> 00:22:37,481
(The second crew, Team Korea)

575
00:22:37,881 --> 00:22:39,150
We're coming.

576
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:40,180
Let's be cool when we enter.

577
00:22:40,181 --> 00:22:41,181
They're coming.

578
00:22:41,311 --> 00:22:42,751
Only the American crew is here.

579
00:22:43,521 --> 00:22:45,221
- Boom.
- I'm not afraid to look at them.

580
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:48,590
Hello.

581
00:22:48,591 --> 00:22:50,661
- Hello.
- Hi.

582
00:22:51,091 --> 00:22:52,860
Hi.

583
00:22:52,861 --> 00:22:53,861
Hey.

584
00:22:54,631 --> 00:22:56,001
(Glancing)

585
00:22:57,861 --> 00:22:59,770
Hi.

586
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:01,700
That's who we have to get our motive from.

587
00:23:01,701 --> 00:23:03,501
(Get your motive from Street Woman Fighter 1.)

588
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:04,841
That's crazy.

589
00:23:06,241 --> 00:23:08,681
Let's see where we're supposed to get our motive from.

590
00:23:09,641 --> 00:23:10,641
(Sighing)

591
00:23:10,841 --> 00:23:11,850
It's begun.

592
00:23:11,851 --> 00:23:13,851
The air of Street Woman Fighter.

593
00:23:14,281 --> 00:23:15,281
It's heavy.

594
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:17,951
- I'm curious about the floor.
- Take a look at it.

595
00:23:18,591 --> 00:23:20,521
(They check the fight zone first since they have experience.)

596
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:22,461
(Rubbing)

597
00:23:22,721 --> 00:23:24,261
Are they going to be dancing in the heels?

598
00:23:25,761 --> 00:23:27,161
(Laughing)

599
00:23:27,761 --> 00:23:28,761
(Dancing)

600
00:23:28,762 --> 00:23:30,130
(Gabee challenges MOTIV.)

601
00:23:30,131 --> 00:23:32,001
(What is she doing?)

602
00:23:33,931 --> 00:23:35,941
First of all, your spirit is important.

603
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:37,570
That's right.

604
00:23:37,571 --> 00:23:38,610
(Queen Gabee is done checking the fight zone.)

605
00:23:38,611 --> 00:23:39,671
(You're funny.)

606
00:23:39,771 --> 00:23:42,780
I don't want to keep looking at the people.

607
00:23:42,781 --> 00:23:44,281
And they're in our eye line too.

608
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:50,851
You want to do something?

609
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:52,651
They're also trying...

610
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:55,791
(Doing a light turn)

611
00:23:58,221 --> 00:23:59,361
The Summer Games athlete.

612
00:24:00,131 --> 00:24:01,531
Ten out of ten.

613
00:24:01,861 --> 00:24:02,930
They're trying to scare us too.

614
00:24:02,931 --> 00:24:04,701
Right. That's why I looked somewhere else.

615
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:06,571
And walk.

616
00:24:07,031 --> 00:24:08,071
This is cool.

617
00:24:08,671 --> 00:24:10,340
Won't we get our evaluation video?

618
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:12,740
Annoy us. Yes, come on.

619
00:24:12,741 --> 00:24:14,771
(The evaluation video for BUMSUP is revealed.)

620
00:24:15,411 --> 00:24:16,580
(They're shocked.)

621
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:18,280
Go.

622
00:24:18,281 --> 00:24:19,910
- Go to the front.
- Let's go.

623
00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:21,811
From the first season?

624
00:24:24,521 --> 00:24:26,350
- I'm ready.
- Don't even.

625
00:24:26,351 --> 00:24:27,950
- What do you mean?
- Goodness.

626
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:30,290
(Hey. What are you saying?)

627
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:32,231
They're easy.

628
00:24:32,991 --> 00:24:34,731
Honey J.

629
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:38,400
I couldn't get what her strength was.

630
00:24:38,401 --> 00:24:40,300
When I saw her dance,

631
00:24:40,301 --> 00:24:43,741
it didn't feel like it was hip-hop.

632
00:24:44,771 --> 00:24:45,970
They make strong statements.

633
00:24:45,971 --> 00:24:47,941
Hip-hop that we both do is different.

634
00:24:48,311 --> 00:24:51,340
When they watch us, they'll be like, "That's Marlee."

635
00:24:51,341 --> 00:24:53,481
That's American hip-hop. You can see.

636
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,111
She better learn today.

637
00:24:56,781 --> 00:24:58,381
They think I'm easy.

638
00:24:58,851 --> 00:25:01,220
They evaluated our leader as weak.

639
00:25:01,221 --> 00:25:02,620
That was very unpleasant.

640
00:25:02,621 --> 00:25:05,191
Honestly, that's like looking down on the entire crew.

641
00:25:05,691 --> 00:25:06,691
I was very mad.

642
00:25:06,692 --> 00:25:07,961
They judged me wrong.

643
00:25:08,491 --> 00:25:10,400
- Aiki?
- Come on, TikTok.

644
00:25:10,401 --> 00:25:13,030
She has a TikTok image.

645
00:25:13,031 --> 00:25:16,041
They claim to be dancers when they can do like 2 8-counts.

646
00:25:16,501 --> 00:25:18,341
TikTok is not always a real dance.

647
00:25:19,241 --> 00:25:21,771
(They're all shocked.)

648
00:25:21,981 --> 00:25:23,980
- How much more must I prove myself?
- But she's already...

649
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,511
Goodness.

650
00:25:26,211 --> 00:25:27,981
Are you sure that's a million?

651
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,281
- She bought them.
- She bought them.

652
00:25:31,481 --> 00:25:32,791
Bought them?

653
00:25:32,851 --> 00:25:33,851
That's crazy.

654
00:25:34,121 --> 00:25:36,521
They're harsh.

655
00:25:36,821 --> 00:25:39,061
What? I bought my followers?

656
00:25:39,631 --> 00:25:42,300
There might have been too many cooks in the kitchen.

657
00:25:42,301 --> 00:25:44,300
Fifth is BUMSUP.

658
00:25:44,301 --> 00:25:46,500
Sixth, we did BUMSUP.

659
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:48,300
Underdogs, right?

660
00:25:48,301 --> 00:25:49,541
- Underdog. Yes.
- Underdog.

661
00:25:49,871 --> 00:25:51,071
That's a shame.

662
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,171
- They're crazy.
- So annoying.

663
00:25:53,571 --> 00:25:55,140
- TikTok dancer.
- Yes.

664
00:25:55,141 --> 00:25:56,211
(I know, right?)

665
00:25:57,141 --> 00:25:59,181
I got mad then.

666
00:25:59,451 --> 00:26:00,451
This is annoying.

667
00:26:00,511 --> 00:26:04,080
It makes you more sensitive because it's between countries.

668
00:26:04,081 --> 00:26:05,180
Right.

669
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:06,421
- Right.
- It makes things worse.

670
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:09,090
It feels like our pride...

671
00:26:09,091 --> 00:26:10,091
- is on the line more.
- Right.

672
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:11,521
I want to win.

673
00:26:12,161 --> 00:26:13,891
Hold yourself together.

674
00:26:13,961 --> 00:26:15,531
Focus.

675
00:26:16,331 --> 00:26:18,501
(The next crew to enter)

676
00:26:20,771 --> 00:26:22,970
- New Zealand.
- New Zealand.

677
00:26:22,971 --> 00:26:24,070
ROYAL FAMILY?

678
00:26:24,071 --> 00:26:25,671
ROYAL FAMILY is out next.

679
00:26:25,971 --> 00:26:27,740
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

680
00:26:27,741 --> 00:26:29,511
- Flag's in the air.
- Go.

681
00:26:30,141 --> 00:26:31,440
They're coming.

682
00:26:31,441 --> 00:26:32,451
ROYAL.

683
00:26:32,581 --> 00:26:35,211
Ready, girls? Five, six, seven, eight.

684
00:26:35,451 --> 00:26:37,051
(ROYAL FAMILY enters the fight zone for the first time.)

685
00:26:39,191 --> 00:26:41,120
ROYAL FAMILY.

686
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:43,161
They got the flag.

687
00:26:43,361 --> 00:26:45,431
They brought the flags.

688
00:26:45,661 --> 00:26:47,591
(Right.)

689
00:26:47,831 --> 00:26:49,631
They put us next to Tokyo and Korea.

690
00:26:49,831 --> 00:26:52,031
- Let's go.
- Gosh. Insane.

691
00:26:52,131 --> 00:26:55,600
This is crazy. Like being here, and we're alive.

692
00:26:55,601 --> 00:26:58,700
Yes. This is so cool. I feel like I'm going to bring it on.

693
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,241
(They're happy.)

694
00:27:02,711 --> 00:27:03,980
(Laughing)

695
00:27:03,981 --> 00:27:06,711
I guess they're very happy.

696
00:27:06,981 --> 00:27:08,210
I guess so.

697
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:09,881
- They're still...
- They're babies.

698
00:27:10,621 --> 00:27:12,351
This laughter will soon go away.

699
00:27:13,351 --> 00:27:14,990
There it goes.

700
00:27:14,991 --> 00:27:15,991
They did it again.

701
00:27:16,061 --> 00:27:17,491
Yes. Let's go.

702
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:20,060
(What's that?)

703
00:27:20,061 --> 00:27:22,060
(At the time of revealing the crew lineup)

704
00:27:22,061 --> 00:27:24,230
(The crew members are shocked from seeing ROYAL FAMILY.)

705
00:27:24,231 --> 00:27:26,470
ROYAL FAMILY is here?

706
00:27:26,471 --> 00:27:28,600
- No.
- Is she here?

707
00:27:28,601 --> 00:27:29,971
They were all scared.

708
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,041
Is she here?

709
00:27:32,771 --> 00:27:34,241
Will there be Parris Goebel?

710
00:27:36,141 --> 00:27:37,411
Leader?

711
00:27:37,511 --> 00:27:38,680
Leader?

712
00:27:38,681 --> 00:27:40,050
Leader?

713
00:27:40,051 --> 00:27:41,210
Teesha.

714
00:27:41,211 --> 00:27:42,880
- She's the leader?
- Yes.

715
00:27:42,881 --> 00:27:44,680
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

716
00:27:44,681 --> 00:27:48,051
The new generation of ROYAL FAMILY.

717
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:51,391
I'd understand if it was the red-haired girl...

718
00:27:51,761 --> 00:27:53,160
who I know well.

719
00:27:53,161 --> 00:27:54,461
But I didn't recognize them.

720
00:27:54,791 --> 00:27:57,360
- Show me what you got, I don't want - Show me what you got, I don't want

721
00:27:57,361 --> 00:27:59,331
No

722
00:27:59,671 --> 00:28:00,971
(Glancing)

723
00:28:01,571 --> 00:28:02,601
Wait.

724
00:28:03,201 --> 00:28:05,441
There's May, there's Kyra.

725
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:07,570
There's Kaea and Ruthy.

726
00:28:07,571 --> 00:28:09,710
Period.

727
00:28:09,711 --> 00:28:11,310
It's like it promotes...

728
00:28:11,311 --> 00:28:13,011
the Australian team at the same time.

729
00:28:13,981 --> 00:28:16,481
It promotes the Australian team at the same time.

730
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:18,950
She has a lot to say.

731
00:28:18,951 --> 00:28:19,951
That's all I'm saying.

732
00:28:20,451 --> 00:28:21,691
She's the leader.

733
00:28:21,751 --> 00:28:23,991
We watched her since she was...

734
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:25,960
- little.
- Child.

735
00:28:25,961 --> 00:28:28,160
We know her inside and out. So that's cool.

736
00:28:28,161 --> 00:28:29,860
She'd know well.

737
00:28:29,861 --> 00:28:31,560
I trained her for a long time.

738
00:28:31,561 --> 00:28:34,071
Bubblegum and RFV. So, yes.

739
00:28:34,371 --> 00:28:36,200
Kyra actually trained Moana.

740
00:28:36,201 --> 00:28:37,601
- Really?
- For a long time.

741
00:28:38,171 --> 00:28:39,841
We gave her some inspiration.

742
00:28:40,811 --> 00:28:41,811
(What?)

743
00:28:42,071 --> 00:28:44,011
They're just like cooking.

744
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:45,880
She has no choreography experience.

745
00:28:45,881 --> 00:28:47,511
No choreography experience. But she's the leader.

746
00:28:47,881 --> 00:28:50,280
How is she the leader if she's not choreographing anything?

747
00:28:50,281 --> 00:28:51,521
That kind of sounded...

748
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:54,291
(Staring)

749
00:28:54,291 --> 00:28:55,291
What?

750
00:28:57,161 --> 00:28:59,061
- That's so rude.
- Yes.

751
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:02,300
If the team leader doesn't have the choreographing experience,

752
00:29:02,301 --> 00:29:04,701
then I don't think the other members...

753
00:29:06,431 --> 00:29:07,630
Why do they say that?

754
00:29:07,631 --> 00:29:08,871
The experience will show.

755
00:29:09,341 --> 00:29:10,970
They filmed the "Level Up" music video.

756
00:29:10,971 --> 00:29:13,370
You can write it there...

757
00:29:13,371 --> 00:29:14,640
even if you were at the very back.

758
00:29:14,641 --> 00:29:16,510
- That's right.
- That's sharp.

759
00:29:16,511 --> 00:29:18,041
That's not true at all.

760
00:29:20,181 --> 00:29:21,181
(Ignoring)

761
00:29:21,311 --> 00:29:24,520
There are so many dancers in Parris' performances.

762
00:29:24,521 --> 00:29:28,720
All the shows by ROYAL FAMILY are created by Parris Goebel.

763
00:29:28,721 --> 00:29:30,321
So, it's Parris Goebel's show.

764
00:29:31,161 --> 00:29:33,231
Oh, my gosh. Stop it.

765
00:29:34,031 --> 00:29:36,330
We came for you guys, and we're here to win.

766
00:29:36,331 --> 00:29:38,231
Watch out. We're getting a throat.

767
00:29:40,601 --> 00:29:42,241
(Goodness)

768
00:29:42,601 --> 00:29:44,770
- Come on.
- Their video was rough.

769
00:29:44,771 --> 00:29:47,341
I felt like ROYAL FAMILY might be the weakest.

770
00:29:47,441 --> 00:29:51,611
(Expected to be eliminated 1st: 6th place, ROYAL FAMILY)

771
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:53,511
Okay.

772
00:29:54,451 --> 00:29:56,521
- They all thought the same thing.
- I know.

773
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:59,690
(Isla)

774
00:29:59,691 --> 00:30:01,821
This is getting too mad.

775
00:30:03,361 --> 00:30:04,921
It hurt their pride.

776
00:30:06,531 --> 00:30:07,630
Because, look!

777
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:09,000
Gosh, I hate it.

778
00:30:09,001 --> 00:30:10,731
- They made it all grey.
- I know.

779
00:30:11,461 --> 00:30:12,931
Gosh, there's no color.

780
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:17,240
- Wrong. Wrong team.
- You wait!

781
00:30:17,241 --> 00:30:18,671
You wait!

782
00:30:19,341 --> 00:30:20,611
(Wait and see!)

783
00:30:20,971 --> 00:30:22,341
They look a little too confident.

784
00:30:22,881 --> 00:30:24,011
(I guess so.)

785
00:30:24,481 --> 00:30:25,611
I don't know.

786
00:30:26,011 --> 00:30:27,911
- We're in a competition.
- I know.

787
00:30:28,611 --> 00:30:29,950
Guys, competitive.

788
00:30:29,951 --> 00:30:31,881
- Serious.
- I'm still mad at the rankings, so.

789
00:30:32,151 --> 00:30:33,291
Bring it on.

790
00:30:33,391 --> 00:30:35,591
- It's getting cooking.
- Yes.

791
00:30:36,091 --> 00:30:37,221
We're the bottom half.

792
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:39,630
So they're bringing out the top three next.

793
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:41,231
All right. Who do you think is going to be next?

794
00:30:42,561 --> 00:30:44,731
Yes, Team Japan!

795
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,801
Which Team Japan?

796
00:30:47,601 --> 00:30:49,441
Tokyo or Osaka?

797
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:53,341
- It's Ojo Gang.
- Ojo Gang!

798
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:55,411
Let's keep the strong mentality.

799
00:30:56,081 --> 00:30:58,410
Let's strike a heavy blow in the battle!

800
00:30:58,411 --> 00:30:59,680
They'll get totally scared by us.

801
00:30:59,681 --> 00:31:01,111
I'm sure they will.

802
00:31:01,281 --> 00:31:03,620
Because I'm going to do this in the battle!

803
00:31:03,621 --> 00:31:04,751
(Confident)

804
00:31:05,221 --> 00:31:06,350
Team Japan,

805
00:31:06,351 --> 00:31:07,821
going in.

806
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:09,691
They're coming.

807
00:31:10,321 --> 00:31:11,791
- Let's go.
- I'm excited.

808
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:14,361
(Charismatic)

809
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,061
(Nervous)

810
00:31:21,971 --> 00:31:24,371
- Ibuki and Kyoka.
- She's a good battle dancer.

811
00:31:25,371 --> 00:31:26,641
That one looks scary.

812
00:31:26,911 --> 00:31:28,611
That's crazy.

813
00:31:28,671 --> 00:31:30,411
(Eyes shaking)

814
00:31:30,611 --> 00:31:32,911
- Ms. Green Hair.
- I'm a little scared.

815
00:31:33,581 --> 00:31:34,651
(Turning her head)

816
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:37,821
(Staring into empty space)

817
00:31:38,321 --> 00:31:40,021
Team Korea.

818
00:31:40,191 --> 00:31:41,751
(Nervous)

819
00:31:42,121 --> 00:31:43,720
I can feel tension.

820
00:31:43,721 --> 00:31:45,091
Are we supposed to sit here?

821
00:31:45,961 --> 00:31:47,461
Ojo Gang is pretty strong now.

822
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:50,430
I feel like Japanese people will just be surprising...

823
00:31:50,431 --> 00:31:51,630
and multi-faceted.

824
00:31:51,631 --> 00:31:53,030
They were most intimidating.

825
00:31:53,031 --> 00:31:54,671
Yes, that strong presence.

826
00:31:57,101 --> 00:31:59,241
(Ojo Gang's evaluation video is revealed.)

827
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:04,740
I knew it!

828
00:32:04,741 --> 00:32:06,081
(Embarrassed)

829
00:32:06,211 --> 00:32:08,510
She has 19 years of battle experience, countless.

830
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:11,481
As a woman street dancer, I have a mad respect for her.

831
00:32:11,921 --> 00:32:13,021
(Thankful)

832
00:32:15,091 --> 00:32:16,261
Ibuki!

833
00:32:17,461 --> 00:32:19,690
- Waacking queen.
- She's the queen.

834
00:32:19,691 --> 00:32:21,590
- She's very experienced in battles.
- Yes.

835
00:32:21,591 --> 00:32:23,131
And she's won all of them.

836
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:25,230
So that's one thing. It's like,

837
00:32:25,231 --> 00:32:27,031
I know this team is going to be strong.

838
00:32:27,201 --> 00:32:29,441
Still, Lip J...

839
00:32:30,071 --> 00:32:32,441
is not just a stroke, but many strokes above her, I think.

840
00:32:34,471 --> 00:32:35,780
I'm not even worried.

841
00:32:35,781 --> 00:32:37,810
Lip J will beat her, of course.

842
00:32:37,811 --> 00:32:39,011
For sure.

843
00:32:39,251 --> 00:32:40,981
Ibuki will win, definitely.

844
00:32:42,651 --> 00:32:44,121
The rivalry.

845
00:32:44,251 --> 00:32:47,091
Ojo Gang? Gangster?

846
00:32:47,851 --> 00:32:49,721
So to what extent you're gangsters?

847
00:32:50,161 --> 00:32:51,491
Do you think you're more like gangsters than us?

848
00:32:51,661 --> 00:32:53,360
We're real gangsters here!

849
00:32:53,361 --> 00:32:55,061
(We're real gangsters here!)

850
00:32:56,101 --> 00:32:57,201
Who said it?

851
00:32:57,761 --> 00:32:59,631
- Who said it?
- She's out of her mind.

852
00:33:02,741 --> 00:33:04,001
That one comes on too strong.

853
00:33:04,871 --> 00:33:06,310
Sort of crazy.

854
00:33:06,311 --> 00:33:07,710
We have two Japan teams?

855
00:33:07,711 --> 00:33:09,811
Japan, Osaka and Tokyo?

856
00:33:10,111 --> 00:33:12,481
Strongest Japanese team. Who do we think?

857
00:33:12,751 --> 00:33:14,081
- Tokyo.
- Tokyo.

858
00:33:14,281 --> 00:33:16,020
- Tokyo.
- Tokyo, yes.

859
00:33:16,021 --> 00:33:17,181
(Irritated)

860
00:33:19,121 --> 00:33:20,991
Rie Hata is so popular.

861
00:33:21,051 --> 00:33:22,761
She's the queen of Japan.

862
00:33:23,221 --> 00:33:24,291
What are they saying?

863
00:33:24,991 --> 00:33:27,460
Other than RHTokyo,

864
00:33:27,461 --> 00:33:30,401
is there a crew that can represent Japan?

865
00:33:30,831 --> 00:33:31,861
I wonder.

866
00:33:33,301 --> 00:33:34,371
I don't think so.

867
00:33:34,771 --> 00:33:36,001
Who's that?

868
00:33:36,401 --> 00:33:38,501
- Who's that?
- "That?"

869
00:33:40,611 --> 00:33:41,810
Osaka?

870
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,241
Ojo Gang.

871
00:33:43,641 --> 00:33:45,811
It's a crew organized for World of Street Woman Fighter.

872
00:33:46,181 --> 00:33:48,181
They look weak. Don't you think so?

873
00:33:49,221 --> 00:33:50,321
That's insane.

874
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:51,821
They talk big.

875
00:33:52,351 --> 00:33:57,390
Since they've all been working individually,

876
00:33:57,391 --> 00:34:01,860
they being one as a team...

877
00:34:01,861 --> 00:34:04,961
was, to be honest, hard to imagine.

878
00:34:05,201 --> 00:34:08,800
As I see, there's no one strong in terms of choreography.

879
00:34:08,801 --> 00:34:12,300
Comparing two Japanese crews, regarding choreography skills,

880
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:14,811
I think I'm better.

881
00:34:15,671 --> 00:34:16,941
I can't help shaking my head.

882
00:34:18,611 --> 00:34:21,510
Only one crew is enough to represent Japan.

883
00:34:21,511 --> 00:34:23,320
Rie Hata is our leader as well.

884
00:34:23,321 --> 00:34:25,120
So I think we represent Japan.

885
00:34:25,121 --> 00:34:26,191
(Innocent)

886
00:34:28,351 --> 00:34:29,361
She's crazy.

887
00:34:29,991 --> 00:34:31,161
(Startled)

888
00:34:31,921 --> 00:34:34,630
What if Ojo Gang confronts us?

889
00:34:34,631 --> 00:34:36,530
I think we can win.

890
00:34:36,531 --> 00:34:38,801
We'll win, definitely.

891
00:34:39,601 --> 00:34:41,370
(Ojo Gang's evaluation video ends.)

892
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:42,741
Aren't they too confident?

893
00:34:43,571 --> 00:34:45,541
I'm excited.

894
00:34:45,671 --> 00:34:47,011
They say they will win.

895
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:50,341
What do you think? They'll never.

896
00:34:50,781 --> 00:34:51,881
We'll smash them.

897
00:34:52,811 --> 00:34:55,310
When RHTokyo battles against Ojo Gang, it will be brutal.

898
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:56,521
It's serious now.

899
00:34:58,921 --> 00:35:00,391
This is so fun.

900
00:35:01,921 --> 00:35:03,921
Australia. Come on.

901
00:35:04,361 --> 00:35:06,590
ROYAL FAMILY? No, AG SQUAD.

902
00:35:06,591 --> 00:35:09,630
I guess the old and new crews know each other.

903
00:35:09,631 --> 00:35:10,631
They should.

904
00:35:10,632 --> 00:35:12,671
- We happen to be related.
- It's been so long.

905
00:35:13,671 --> 00:35:14,731
Rivalry.

906
00:35:15,231 --> 00:35:16,671
Here they come.

907
00:35:17,801 --> 00:35:18,801
(Surprised)

908
00:35:18,802 --> 00:35:19,811
Here they are.

909
00:35:20,971 --> 00:35:22,681
(AG SQUAD appears in a relaxed manner.)

910
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:24,811
(Eyes fixed)

911
00:35:26,381 --> 00:35:28,711
They look alive.

912
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,321
A red-haired sister.

913
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:32,991
(Staring)

914
00:35:34,751 --> 00:35:35,751
(Turning her head away)

915
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:39,161
(Kaea takes away her eyes from ROYAL FAMILY right away.)

916
00:35:39,461 --> 00:35:40,991
(Flustered)

917
00:35:41,691 --> 00:35:42,761
That's embarrassing.

918
00:35:43,161 --> 00:35:44,531
Oh, my goodness.

919
00:35:46,071 --> 00:35:47,671
(Cautious)

920
00:35:47,931 --> 00:35:50,540
Their energy was confident.

921
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:52,270
(They look so awesome.)

922
00:35:52,271 --> 00:35:54,441
(Entering with confidence, attracting everyone's attention)

923
00:35:54,771 --> 00:35:56,711
They're the former ROYAL FAMILY.

924
00:35:57,281 --> 00:35:59,480
They're real. It's unbelievable.

925
00:35:59,481 --> 00:36:01,480
There are a blue-haired one and a red-haired one.

926
00:36:01,481 --> 00:36:03,351
Their hair makes them look like ROYAL FAMILY.

927
00:36:03,621 --> 00:36:06,220
This is my first time to see them in person, so I'm amazed.

928
00:36:06,221 --> 00:36:07,390
Me too.

929
00:36:07,391 --> 00:36:09,760
They have an aura. They look legendary.

930
00:36:09,761 --> 00:36:11,020
They smile a lot.

931
00:36:11,021 --> 00:36:12,991
They definitely are experienced.

932
00:36:13,991 --> 00:36:16,630
Do you see how ROYAL FAMILY can't even look at us?

933
00:36:16,631 --> 00:36:17,631
I know.

934
00:36:19,331 --> 00:36:21,670
Guys, I looked at them,

935
00:36:21,671 --> 00:36:24,440
- and they went like this.
- Yes. That was awkward.

936
00:36:24,441 --> 00:36:26,511
Was it because we placed them low?

937
00:36:26,641 --> 00:36:27,710
Maybe.

938
00:36:27,711 --> 00:36:28,770
(Grinning)

939
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:30,581
- That was a genuine reaction.
- Yes.

940
00:36:32,881 --> 00:36:34,511
(AG SQAUD's expected ranking to win: 2nd place)

941
00:36:34,781 --> 00:36:36,021
Yes.

942
00:36:37,181 --> 00:36:38,380
They're in 6th and 2nd each.

943
00:36:38,381 --> 00:36:40,291
They look stronger than ROYAL FAMILY.

944
00:36:41,251 --> 00:36:42,251
Funny.

945
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:45,121
They must feel pretty furious.

946
00:36:45,391 --> 00:36:47,261
Just wait to see the switch.

947
00:36:47,431 --> 00:36:49,601
We're going to show you who the queen is.

948
00:36:50,631 --> 00:36:52,001
(AG SQUAD's evaluation video is revealed.)

949
00:36:53,301 --> 00:36:54,301
Feedback.

950
00:36:54,302 --> 00:36:55,571
AG SQUAD?

951
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:57,300
Oh, my gosh!

952
00:36:57,301 --> 00:36:58,340
(Startled)

953
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,770
Why are you here?

954
00:36:59,771 --> 00:37:00,910
(Laughing)

955
00:37:00,911 --> 00:37:02,171
I know!

956
00:37:02,371 --> 00:37:05,381
When I hear the word ROYAL FAMILY, I'm reminded of them.

957
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,051
They totally are the main force.

958
00:37:10,081 --> 00:37:12,021
The core members are all here.

959
00:37:13,891 --> 00:37:15,091
That was a long time ago.

960
00:37:15,521 --> 00:37:19,121
ROYAL FAMILY generation has already changed.

961
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:22,590
Some of the dancers have had a couple of breaks,

962
00:37:22,591 --> 00:37:26,100
for the past five years or maybe longer.

963
00:37:26,101 --> 00:37:28,131
I guess she hasn't danced for a long while.

964
00:37:29,471 --> 00:37:32,040
I wouldn't have come if I couldn't dance anymore.

965
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,171
Use your brains.

966
00:37:34,941 --> 00:37:37,410
So many of them come from ROYAL FAMILY.

967
00:37:37,411 --> 00:37:39,911
What do they look like, separate from ROYAL FAMILY?

968
00:37:40,711 --> 00:37:43,320
(What do they look like, separate from ROYAL FAMILY?)

969
00:37:43,321 --> 00:37:44,820
(Shocked)

970
00:37:44,821 --> 00:37:46,790
We could see how she dances.

971
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:48,421
How has she improved or...

972
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:51,061
This is getting serious.

973
00:37:53,061 --> 00:37:56,660
For sure, they will dance similarly with the current ROYAL FAMILY.

974
00:37:56,661 --> 00:37:58,661
Then they will be compared here.

975
00:37:58,761 --> 00:38:00,630
Has the young versus the old begun again?

976
00:38:00,631 --> 00:38:02,631
It's the old generation versus the new generation.

977
00:38:02,841 --> 00:38:07,341
Okay, so who's going to be here representing ROYAL FAMILY?

978
00:38:07,471 --> 00:38:09,511
That will be the battle of pride.

979
00:38:09,641 --> 00:38:12,710
They were the seniors when we were younger and starting.

980
00:38:12,711 --> 00:38:14,080
Now, you know,

981
00:38:14,081 --> 00:38:15,380
- we're at the same level.
- Yes, at the same level.

982
00:38:15,381 --> 00:38:16,681
We're at the same level.

983
00:38:16,751 --> 00:38:18,750
It's because we're not young anymore.

984
00:38:18,751 --> 00:38:20,391
(We're all grown.)

985
00:38:20,621 --> 00:38:23,221
- Crazy.
- Yes, that's crazy.

986
00:38:23,691 --> 00:38:25,691
(They talk tough.)

987
00:38:25,821 --> 00:38:29,190
Their strength lies in the choreography,

988
00:38:29,191 --> 00:38:30,731
like they were doing at that time.

989
00:38:32,031 --> 00:38:34,370
The choreography we do is harder.

990
00:38:34,371 --> 00:38:35,700
Yes, definitely.

991
00:38:35,701 --> 00:38:37,471
Way more complex.

992
00:38:37,641 --> 00:38:38,841
(Taken aback)

993
00:38:40,741 --> 00:38:43,381
(Kaea is outrageous after watching ROYAL FAMILY's evaluation.)

994
00:38:43,911 --> 00:38:44,911
(Avoiding her eyes)

995
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,811
(Intrigued)

996
00:38:47,751 --> 00:38:49,651
(Indifferent)

997
00:38:49,951 --> 00:38:51,320
I think we'll win.

998
00:38:51,321 --> 00:38:52,991
I'm stronger than them, too.

999
00:38:54,921 --> 00:38:56,291
Yes, right.

1000
00:38:58,021 --> 00:39:02,131
- This is crazy.
- Crazy.

1001
00:39:06,131 --> 00:39:08,231
It's like a war of nerves.

1002
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:10,370
It's the new generation versus the old generation.

1003
00:39:10,371 --> 00:39:12,571
That's why it's our time to prove.

1004
00:39:14,171 --> 00:39:15,971
- I don't like you guys.
- Let's kill them.

1005
00:39:16,181 --> 00:39:18,041
I can't wait for the battles to be on.

1006
00:39:19,111 --> 00:39:21,081
- Right.
- They're ready.

1007
00:39:21,311 --> 00:39:22,451
It's getting exciting.

1008
00:39:23,481 --> 00:39:25,520
Gosh, the last crew.

1009
00:39:25,521 --> 00:39:26,521
Japan.

1010
00:39:28,591 --> 00:39:29,790
RHTokyo.

1011
00:39:29,791 --> 00:39:30,891
(The last crew is RHTokyo.)

1012
00:39:32,891 --> 00:39:34,291
It's interesting to watch.

1013
00:39:34,931 --> 00:39:36,801
- I'm so excited.
- It's exciting.

1014
00:39:37,261 --> 00:39:40,070
Let's go, RHTokyo!

1015
00:39:40,071 --> 00:39:41,630
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1016
00:39:41,631 --> 00:39:42,840
- RHTokyo!
- RHTokyo!

1017
00:39:42,841 --> 00:39:44,071
It's the fight zone.

1018
00:39:44,271 --> 00:39:45,341
I think they're coming.

1019
00:39:45,671 --> 00:39:46,970
Tokyo.

1020
00:39:46,971 --> 00:39:48,211
Here they come.

1021
00:39:48,571 --> 00:39:49,581
Are they coming?

1022
00:39:50,511 --> 00:39:52,780
(Being in awe)

1023
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:54,280
(Excited)

1024
00:39:54,281 --> 00:39:55,281
It's cool.

1025
00:39:55,581 --> 00:39:57,650
They look like Tokyo.

1026
00:39:57,651 --> 00:39:59,421
- Yes.
- Tokyo street fashion.

1027
00:39:59,951 --> 00:40:01,951
They're so cute.

1028
00:40:02,051 --> 00:40:04,191
There are teams from Osaka and Tokyo.

1029
00:40:04,791 --> 00:40:06,021
Their fashion style is different.

1030
00:40:06,231 --> 00:40:08,931
Their dance styles are quite different,

1031
00:40:09,601 --> 00:40:11,761
so they don't seem to be from the same country.

1032
00:40:14,401 --> 00:40:16,841
(I'm so excited.)

1033
00:40:17,271 --> 00:40:19,271
They seem to just have fun.

1034
00:40:19,611 --> 00:40:22,881
We're at Street Woman Fighter to fight.

1035
00:40:23,911 --> 00:40:25,081
Are they here just for fun?

1036
00:40:26,781 --> 00:40:28,850
(Being in the best mood)

1037
00:40:28,851 --> 00:40:30,721
We're on the world stage after a long time.

1038
00:40:31,081 --> 00:40:33,351
But they don't look serious or tense.

1039
00:40:33,951 --> 00:40:35,421
Okay. Sit down.

1040
00:40:38,461 --> 00:40:40,161
(What?)

1041
00:40:40,531 --> 00:40:42,631
I want to see the fight judge's seat.

1042
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:43,761
She's going to the fight judge's seat.

1043
00:40:46,401 --> 00:40:48,601
- Is she going to sit on the chair?
- Is she?

1044
00:40:49,201 --> 00:40:50,270
Oh, my gosh.

1045
00:40:50,271 --> 00:40:53,711
I was the judge, sitting here in the last season.

1046
00:40:54,571 --> 00:40:57,041
(Rie Hata was the special judge for Mega Crew Mission in Season 2.)

1047
00:40:58,711 --> 00:41:00,111
(My leader is the best.)

1048
00:41:00,611 --> 00:41:02,510
She's showing off that she was the judge.

1049
00:41:02,511 --> 00:41:03,580
- This is cool.
- Yes.

1050
00:41:03,581 --> 00:41:04,750
(Annoyed)

1051
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:06,421
Okay. Wrap it up.

1052
00:41:07,721 --> 00:41:08,791
Oh, my gosh.

1053
00:41:08,991 --> 00:41:10,121
(Surprised)

1054
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:12,021
(Screaming)

1055
00:41:12,361 --> 00:41:14,060
(I knew it.)

1056
00:41:14,061 --> 00:41:16,501
When I think of Japan, I think of Rie Hata.

1057
00:41:16,561 --> 00:41:17,931
Yes.

1058
00:41:18,631 --> 00:41:20,070
They have choreographers...

1059
00:41:20,071 --> 00:41:22,131
- who have worked with K-pop groups.
- That's true.

1060
00:41:22,231 --> 00:41:23,841
It's great. They're giving us good comments.

1061
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:28,570
But they don't have experience in battle lately.

1062
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:29,810
(Past battle: Twice in 2009, twice in 2010, none since then)

1063
00:41:29,811 --> 00:41:32,411
Even if Rie Hata is in a battle, we can totally beat her.

1064
00:41:33,851 --> 00:41:35,381
- Oh, my gosh.
- What?

1065
00:41:35,851 --> 00:41:37,050
(Is she serious?)

1066
00:41:37,051 --> 00:41:38,281
It's so vicious.

1067
00:41:39,691 --> 00:41:42,021
(It's fun to watch.)

1068
00:41:42,121 --> 00:41:45,590
There is a difference between a choreographer's freestyling...

1069
00:41:45,591 --> 00:41:47,860
and a freestyler who knows how to freestyle.

1070
00:41:47,861 --> 00:41:48,861
Yes.

1071
00:41:48,862 --> 00:41:49,901
Marlee?

1072
00:41:50,901 --> 00:41:52,601
It's just too much that they couldn't do.

1073
00:41:53,171 --> 00:41:54,200
(Chuckling)

1074
00:41:54,201 --> 00:41:57,100
When you come to a battle...

1075
00:41:57,101 --> 00:42:00,041
and are recognized by others, you're a real dancer.

1076
00:42:00,611 --> 00:42:01,671
I'll just be tutting.

1077
00:42:02,471 --> 00:42:03,481
(Tutting)

1078
00:42:03,611 --> 00:42:05,241
(What?)

1079
00:42:05,611 --> 00:42:06,611
(Flustered)

1080
00:42:08,481 --> 00:42:10,080
(That's harsh.)

1081
00:42:10,081 --> 00:42:12,121
It's not wrong. I hear her.

1082
00:42:12,221 --> 00:42:14,491
Crazy.

1083
00:42:15,351 --> 00:42:16,791
(Mimicking Kyoka)

1084
00:42:16,891 --> 00:42:20,430
I don't remember much about anyone from RHTokyo.

1085
00:42:20,431 --> 00:42:21,731
Is it because their dance style is all the same?

1086
00:42:22,091 --> 00:42:24,830
They don't have an individual's uniqueness,

1087
00:42:24,831 --> 00:42:29,201
but just copy Rie Hata.

1088
00:42:29,601 --> 00:42:30,671
She thinks just like us.

1089
00:42:30,771 --> 00:42:33,271
They don't look like colleagues but kids...

1090
00:42:33,411 --> 00:42:34,941
who are still learning from their teacher.

1091
00:42:35,611 --> 00:42:37,181
Rie Hata overpowered them.

1092
00:42:37,381 --> 00:42:38,610
(Laughing)

1093
00:42:38,611 --> 00:42:40,080
That's not true.

1094
00:42:40,081 --> 00:42:41,711
Oh, my gosh.

1095
00:42:42,511 --> 00:42:44,381
I honestly don't know...

1096
00:42:44,981 --> 00:42:47,851
why we have two teams representing Japan.

1097
00:42:48,051 --> 00:42:49,860
That's exactly what we think.

1098
00:42:49,861 --> 00:42:51,761
We've been saying that the whole time.

1099
00:42:51,991 --> 00:42:53,691
They're pissed.

1100
00:42:54,491 --> 00:42:56,501
They're really upset.

1101
00:42:57,401 --> 00:42:58,700
(No Respect World Battle)

1102
00:42:58,701 --> 00:42:59,970
(It's time to choose No Respect Dancer.)

1103
00:42:59,971 --> 00:43:02,071
- Should we pick all of Rie Hata's?
- Sure.

1104
00:43:02,171 --> 00:43:03,671
(No way)

1105
00:43:03,871 --> 00:43:05,170
(Really?)

1106
00:43:05,171 --> 00:43:07,241
- Are we really doing it?
- Of course.

1107
00:43:08,741 --> 00:43:09,980
Oh, my gosh.

1108
00:43:09,981 --> 00:43:12,141
- Are we really doing it?
- Of course.

1109
00:43:16,681 --> 00:43:19,320
That's crazy.

1110
00:43:19,321 --> 00:43:21,091
Kyoka might continue to call each of them out.

1111
00:43:24,261 --> 00:43:25,991
I don't usually start fights,

1112
00:43:26,261 --> 00:43:28,061
but I fight back if anyone comes at me first.

1113
00:43:29,191 --> 00:43:30,630
I'm so excited.

1114
00:43:30,631 --> 00:43:32,961
It's so fun.

1115
00:43:33,471 --> 00:43:35,231
(Bring it on.)

1116
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:36,941
Oh, my gosh.

1117
00:43:38,101 --> 00:43:39,441
It'll be cool to call them out for a battle.

1118
00:43:40,441 --> 00:43:42,070
(Laughing)

1119
00:43:42,071 --> 00:43:43,811
This is crazy.

1120
00:43:44,141 --> 00:43:46,611
They'll go out of their minds over this.

1121
00:43:48,151 --> 00:43:49,351
I'm so mad.

1122
00:43:49,881 --> 00:43:51,920
Let's beat them with our dance.

1123
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:53,221
- Yes.
- Let's do that.

1124
00:43:53,991 --> 00:43:56,761
Everyone looks so down because they hurt their pride.

1125
00:43:58,261 --> 00:43:59,321
Are we on the sixth?

1126
00:44:02,731 --> 00:44:04,001
She looks angry.

1127
00:44:04,431 --> 00:44:06,430
It's actually more emotional than I thought it would be.

1128
00:44:06,431 --> 00:44:07,431
Yes.

1129
00:44:07,971 --> 00:44:09,841
(Angry)

1130
00:44:10,671 --> 00:44:13,041
No one's making eye contact.

1131
00:44:14,841 --> 00:44:17,841
Ladies and gentlemen.

1132
00:44:18,181 --> 00:44:20,350
Let's introduce the new host.

1133
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,351
New host?

1134
00:44:21,352 --> 00:44:22,910
Of the World of Street Woman Fighter.

1135
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,181
A guy? A man?

1136
00:44:24,281 --> 00:44:27,890
Please welcome Sung Han Bin.

1137
00:44:27,891 --> 00:44:28,921
Sung Han Bin.

1138
00:44:30,821 --> 00:44:32,121
Sung Han Bin.

1139
00:44:33,831 --> 00:44:35,690
(The host of WSWF, Sung Han Bin)

1140
00:44:35,691 --> 00:44:37,160
I was surprised because he was so good-looking.

1141
00:44:37,161 --> 00:44:38,601
He was quite glowing.

1142
00:44:38,831 --> 00:44:40,070
How could he look like that?

1143
00:44:40,071 --> 00:44:42,401
You're so handsome!

1144
00:44:42,601 --> 00:44:43,640
(After competing on the show "Boys Planet,")

1145
00:44:43,641 --> 00:44:44,701
(he debuted as a member of ZEROBASEONE.)

1146
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:48,311
(His dance skills have been proven in the waacking battle with Lip J.)

1147
00:44:48,941 --> 00:44:49,981
(He's pretty good.)

1148
00:44:50,381 --> 00:44:52,680
(He's an all-rounder who loves dancing...)

1149
00:44:52,681 --> 00:44:54,951
(and was a tutting and waacking dancer before his debut.)

1150
00:44:55,011 --> 00:44:58,521
(The first K-pop idol who dances tutting)

1151
00:44:58,621 --> 00:45:02,351
(The leader of ZEROBASEONE, Sung Han Bin)

1152
00:45:02,521 --> 00:45:04,560
He's gorgeous.

1153
00:45:04,561 --> 00:45:05,961
He's so handsome.

1154
00:45:06,661 --> 00:45:08,061
That's Ruthy's style.

1155
00:45:08,761 --> 00:45:10,101
There he is.

1156
00:45:10,401 --> 00:45:12,060
(Glowing)

1157
00:45:12,061 --> 00:45:14,101
I love that style. Cute.

1158
00:45:15,731 --> 00:45:16,801
Go!

1159
00:45:17,141 --> 00:45:20,611
I'm Sung Han Bin, the host of World of Street Woman Fighter.

1160
00:45:21,771 --> 00:45:24,981
(Welcome)

1161
00:45:25,111 --> 00:45:26,881
The first dance battle you'll have…

1162
00:45:26,981 --> 00:45:29,651
for the crown to win is…

1163
00:45:29,851 --> 00:45:33,521
the signature of Mnet's original dance series,

1164
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:38,461
No Respect World Battle.

1165
00:45:38,821 --> 00:45:41,060
We're representing our country.

1166
00:45:41,061 --> 00:45:42,760
I'm a proud Korean dancer.

1167
00:45:42,761 --> 00:45:44,800
We deserve to represent the US.

1168
00:45:44,801 --> 00:45:47,070
Team New Zealand is ready to come in.

1169
00:45:47,071 --> 00:45:49,501
We'll really show what Australia is all about.

1170
00:45:50,001 --> 00:45:51,070
OSAKA Ojo Gang...

1171
00:45:51,071 --> 00:45:52,170
RHTokyo will show...

1172
00:45:52,171 --> 00:45:53,540
We're representing Japan.

1173
00:45:53,541 --> 00:45:55,340
We're representing Japan.

1174
00:45:55,341 --> 00:45:56,981
We'll definitely win.

1175
00:45:57,081 --> 00:45:59,911
During the previous evaluation, each of the six crews…

1176
00:46:00,011 --> 00:46:02,681
selected weak dancers you believed you could easily defeat,

1177
00:46:02,781 --> 00:46:06,321
dancers who were not better than you as No Respect Dancer.

1178
00:46:06,891 --> 00:46:07,991
Because I know I got them.

1179
00:46:08,191 --> 00:46:09,960
I can beat them all. No Respect.

1180
00:46:09,961 --> 00:46:11,821
- Should we select all?
- Should we?

1181
00:46:11,921 --> 00:46:12,921
Of course.

1182
00:46:13,261 --> 00:46:17,531
We will now reveal the No Respect Status by the crew.

1183
00:46:17,731 --> 00:46:18,961
(No Respect World Battle)

1184
00:46:22,531 --> 00:46:23,801
No Respect.

1185
00:46:24,501 --> 00:46:27,341
Okay, No Respect. Here we go. Give us some respect.

1186
00:46:27,411 --> 00:46:28,971
The No Respect Status...

1187
00:46:29,071 --> 00:46:31,511
is revealed by each country's leader...

1188
00:46:31,641 --> 00:46:34,480
receiving all the votes their crew members were given...

1189
00:46:34,481 --> 00:46:36,621
for being No Respect Dancers.

1190
00:46:36,721 --> 00:46:38,321
When the crew is called,

1191
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:41,091
its leader will come to the center of the fight zone.

1192
00:46:41,621 --> 00:46:44,860
Dancers who selected a dancer from the crew as No Respect Dancer...

1193
00:46:44,861 --> 00:46:46,690
will come forward and put...

1194
00:46:46,691 --> 00:46:49,791
a No Respect sticker on the leader.

1195
00:46:50,501 --> 00:46:53,271
If they picked us, it's going to be a challenge.

1196
00:46:53,371 --> 00:46:55,931
This is Street Woman Fighter. I don't want to lose.

1197
00:46:56,031 --> 00:46:58,500
They shouldn't put No Respect stickers...

1198
00:46:58,501 --> 00:47:00,071
on RHTokyo without thinking carefully.

1199
00:47:00,541 --> 00:47:02,941
The fact is that everyone is scared of us.

1200
00:47:03,041 --> 00:47:06,140
I think it's a big mistake if you give me a No Respect sticker.

1201
00:47:06,141 --> 00:47:08,451
I think they're just comfortable with us.

1202
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:12,880
I'll call the crew to see the No Respect Status.

1203
00:47:12,881 --> 00:47:14,351
(Which crew's No Respect Status will we see?)

1204
00:47:15,921 --> 00:47:18,321
- I think it's us.
- Team Korea.

1205
00:47:18,691 --> 00:47:20,091
It's BUMSUP.

1206
00:47:23,301 --> 00:47:24,431
How many would we get?

1207
00:47:24,531 --> 00:47:25,531
I guess five?

1208
00:47:26,361 --> 00:47:27,800
We're doing it in Korea.

1209
00:47:27,801 --> 00:47:29,330
So, we're the host.

1210
00:47:29,331 --> 00:47:31,041
I don't want to get a lot.

1211
00:47:31,571 --> 00:47:34,471
I hope my team doesn't look so weak.

1212
00:47:34,941 --> 00:47:38,041
I think BUMSUP will get a lot.

1213
00:47:38,141 --> 00:47:41,451
Leader Honey J, please come to the center of the fight zone.

1214
00:47:42,081 --> 00:47:43,381
We're confident.

1215
00:47:43,881 --> 00:47:47,391
Easy money.

1216
00:47:47,751 --> 00:47:48,751
We're experienced.

1217
00:47:50,061 --> 00:47:52,221
They look easy to beat. No lie.

1218
00:47:52,321 --> 00:47:55,491
Honestly, I don't get intimidated by BUMSUP.

1219
00:47:55,891 --> 00:47:59,260
They're all leaders who have experienced this,

1220
00:47:59,261 --> 00:48:00,331
but they look weak.

1221
00:48:01,401 --> 00:48:03,741
I felt they were holding us in check.

1222
00:48:03,941 --> 00:48:05,471
This is Street Woman Fighter.

1223
00:48:06,001 --> 00:48:07,311
Let's not be intimidated.

1224
00:48:07,871 --> 00:48:10,211
Please put No Respect stickers.

1225
00:48:11,481 --> 00:48:12,481
(Glancing)

1226
00:48:12,581 --> 00:48:13,711
(Are you ready?)

1227
00:48:13,781 --> 00:48:14,981
Yes. Will you give me that?

1228
00:48:17,221 --> 00:48:18,421
(Watching)

1229
00:48:18,821 --> 00:48:20,520
Let's give everyone a sticker right now.

1230
00:48:20,521 --> 00:48:21,621
Because they'll run to put it on.

1231
00:48:22,221 --> 00:48:23,251
What are they doing?

1232
00:48:24,121 --> 00:48:25,961
No Respect. Let's go.

1233
00:48:26,591 --> 00:48:28,291
Look at AG SQUAD.

1234
00:48:28,391 --> 00:48:29,791
Let's go, girls.

1235
00:48:30,701 --> 00:48:31,701
(Let's go.)

1236
00:48:32,831 --> 00:48:35,631
It's about to be a show.

1237
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:39,541
That's too many.

1238
00:48:39,601 --> 00:48:40,671
Because they're easy.

1239
00:48:41,211 --> 00:48:42,871
Underdog. They are, right?

1240
00:48:43,811 --> 00:48:45,341
I think they're making a mistake.

1241
00:48:47,311 --> 00:48:48,511
Respectfully.

1242
00:48:49,081 --> 00:48:50,151
What are they doing?

1243
00:48:51,381 --> 00:48:52,421
I was speechless.

1244
00:48:53,351 --> 00:48:55,221
- Look.
- ROYAL FAMILY is coming out.

1245
00:48:56,151 --> 00:48:57,791
Compete against BUMSUP.

1246
00:48:58,561 --> 00:48:59,561
What's going on?

1247
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:02,231
Because we have a strong feeling that we're going to win.

1248
00:49:02,331 --> 00:49:03,531
They're out of their mind.

1249
00:49:03,861 --> 00:49:06,501
I'm mad. They think we're easy.

1250
00:49:07,801 --> 00:49:09,901
Okay. Let's go.

1251
00:49:10,001 --> 00:49:11,071
MOTIV?

1252
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:13,710
RHTokyo. OSAKA Ojo Gang.

1253
00:49:13,711 --> 00:49:15,341
- What is this? Everyone is coming.
- They are...

1254
00:49:15,871 --> 00:49:17,941
(Shocked and flustered)

1255
00:49:18,841 --> 00:49:19,910
There are so many.

1256
00:49:19,911 --> 00:49:21,310
(All five crews are putting No Respect stickers on.)

1257
00:49:21,311 --> 00:49:22,781
It looks like a group of zombies.

1258
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:25,351
We can win against BUMSUP.

1259
00:49:25,721 --> 00:49:28,491
They don't look united.

1260
00:49:28,521 --> 00:49:30,120
They don't work as a team.

1261
00:49:30,121 --> 00:49:32,661
A lot of people thought BUMSUP was easy.

1262
00:49:33,361 --> 00:49:34,630
It was a mess.

1263
00:49:34,631 --> 00:49:36,290
How dare you embarrass us right in our faces?

1264
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:37,961
Stop coming after us!

1265
00:49:38,501 --> 00:49:40,061
It felt like we were attacked by a group.

1266
00:49:40,371 --> 00:49:41,801
Are we being bullied?

1267
00:49:42,601 --> 00:49:43,601
(Conflicted)

1268
00:49:44,001 --> 00:49:46,441
There was no more space left. They were putting it on her back.

1269
00:49:47,411 --> 00:49:48,440
How many are there?

1270
00:49:48,441 --> 00:49:49,770
Why are there so many?

1271
00:49:49,771 --> 00:49:50,781
They got the most.

1272
00:49:51,611 --> 00:49:53,181
One, two, three, four, five...

1273
00:49:53,481 --> 00:49:54,481
Ten?

1274
00:49:54,851 --> 00:49:56,151
I was shocked.

1275
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:58,851
Did we lack respect this much?

1276
00:49:59,521 --> 00:50:00,820
(12 dancers picked BUMSUP as No Respect Dancer.)

1277
00:50:00,821 --> 00:50:01,821
(Shocked)

1278
00:50:06,291 --> 00:50:08,660
(Staring)

1279
00:50:08,661 --> 00:50:12,861
(12 dancers picked BUMSUP as No Respect Dancer.)

1280
00:50:13,531 --> 00:50:14,731
Twelve.

1281
00:50:15,431 --> 00:50:16,531
Aiki?

1282
00:50:18,241 --> 00:50:19,970
(Aiki)

1283
00:50:19,971 --> 00:50:22,371
(Shocked)

1284
00:50:24,381 --> 00:50:25,810
(Aiki received the most No Respect stickers from the dancers so far.)

1285
00:50:25,811 --> 00:50:27,311
- Aiki...
- Hey.

1286
00:50:27,881 --> 00:50:28,881
No.

1287
00:50:28,981 --> 00:50:30,881
(Eyes open wide)

1288
00:50:31,321 --> 00:50:33,320
Aiki, no way.

1289
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:34,720
Oh, my gosh.

1290
00:50:34,721 --> 00:50:35,790
Who's Aiki?

1291
00:50:35,791 --> 00:50:37,691
Is that Chucky's daughter?

1292
00:50:40,261 --> 00:50:41,731
That's upsetting.

1293
00:50:42,661 --> 00:50:43,930
I'm surprised with it.

1294
00:50:43,931 --> 00:50:45,461
And the mother...

1295
00:50:45,761 --> 00:50:47,471
She's like, "I just do TikTok."

1296
00:50:48,071 --> 00:50:50,270
- They're clueless.
- I hate being disregarded.

1297
00:50:50,271 --> 00:50:52,301
Aiki. No. I understand.

1298
00:50:53,101 --> 00:50:54,440
She's annoyed today.

1299
00:50:54,441 --> 00:50:55,911
I'm not happy about it.

1300
00:50:56,241 --> 00:50:59,511
You'll get to know who I am today.

1301
00:50:59,981 --> 00:51:00,981
Go, Chucky.

1302
00:51:01,351 --> 00:51:03,481
Oh, please girl. I feel bad.

1303
00:51:04,151 --> 00:51:05,651
I'm excited to see how they battle.

1304
00:51:06,151 --> 00:51:07,190
I was angry.

1305
00:51:07,191 --> 00:51:08,590
I felt bad for my members at the same time.

1306
00:51:08,591 --> 00:51:11,661
I decided not to cause my team harm.

1307
00:51:15,331 --> 00:51:17,200
I want to pull off the battle.

1308
00:51:17,201 --> 00:51:18,531
Bring it on.

1309
00:51:18,961 --> 00:51:21,371
They already upset me.

1310
00:51:21,801 --> 00:51:23,701
We have to be strong.

1311
00:51:24,071 --> 00:51:26,141
I'm darn upset. I won't forgive them.

1312
00:51:26,571 --> 00:51:28,511
(ROYAL FAMILY's Crew Agit)

1313
00:51:28,771 --> 00:51:29,940
(Exploding with anger)

1314
00:51:29,941 --> 00:51:32,410
I just can't believe that they ranked us last.

1315
00:51:32,411 --> 00:51:33,411
We're not going home.

1316
00:51:33,412 --> 00:51:34,910
We'll beat them up anyway.

1317
00:51:34,911 --> 00:51:36,250
We're going to be game on.

1318
00:51:36,251 --> 00:51:38,180
(Switching to the competition mode)

1319
00:51:38,181 --> 00:51:40,350
- We're ready, baby. Let's go.
- Go.

1320
00:51:40,351 --> 00:51:41,691
What?

1321
00:51:41,791 --> 00:51:43,791
It'll be someone from ROYAL FAMILY for battling.

1322
00:51:43,991 --> 00:51:45,520
Either Kylie or Teesha.

1323
00:51:45,521 --> 00:51:48,190
That's crazy.

1324
00:51:48,191 --> 00:51:49,660
That's crazy.

1325
00:51:49,661 --> 00:51:50,661
Don't be mean.

1326
00:51:51,061 --> 00:51:52,331
How dare you look down on Korea?

1327
00:51:52,531 --> 00:51:54,330
You're so dead. I'm going to kill you.

1328
00:51:54,331 --> 00:51:55,800
I'm going to rip them apart.

1329
00:51:55,801 --> 00:51:56,940
Let's win.

1330
00:51:56,941 --> 00:51:58,840
Let's win.

1331
00:51:58,841 --> 00:52:00,370
(Meanwhile, OSAKA Ojo Gang looks different.)

1332
00:52:00,371 --> 00:52:01,770
We look so strong.

1333
00:52:01,771 --> 00:52:03,070
You look relaxed.

1334
00:52:03,071 --> 00:52:04,080
We're so cool.

1335
00:52:04,081 --> 00:52:06,040
I knew they'd be scared of Osaka.

1336
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:07,051
They're scared.

1337
00:52:07,511 --> 00:52:09,210
I want to know who called me out.

1338
00:52:09,211 --> 00:52:11,020
That's crazy.

1339
00:52:11,021 --> 00:52:12,081
Actually, it's fearless.

1340
00:52:12,221 --> 00:52:14,790
We ate here.

1341
00:52:14,791 --> 00:52:15,851
Eight.

1342
00:52:16,021 --> 00:52:17,690
It's not that I'm discouraged,

1343
00:52:17,691 --> 00:52:19,121
but it turned my switch on.

1344
00:52:19,221 --> 00:52:21,361
Nice. Let's show them.

1345
00:52:21,691 --> 00:52:22,730
Bring it on.

1346
00:52:22,731 --> 00:52:24,301
I can beat them all.

1347
00:52:24,661 --> 00:52:26,330
I can't wait to battle.

1348
00:52:26,331 --> 00:52:27,531
Go, queens.

1349
00:52:29,571 --> 00:52:31,040
(With tension,)

1350
00:52:31,041 --> 00:52:32,170
(everyone begins warming up.)

1351
00:52:32,171 --> 00:52:33,940
- Logan.
- Hey.

1352
00:52:33,941 --> 00:52:35,310
That's so cool.

1353
00:52:35,311 --> 00:52:36,510
Yes. It's aggressive.

1354
00:52:36,511 --> 00:52:37,911
You're so cool.

1355
00:52:38,241 --> 00:52:39,680
(Spinning)

1356
00:52:39,681 --> 00:52:40,911
(Good job.)

1357
00:52:41,351 --> 00:52:43,081
Who's brave enough to battle with Lo?

1358
00:52:43,511 --> 00:52:45,020
(Meanwhile, a different kind of sharpness appears.)

1359
00:52:45,021 --> 00:52:46,421
Those are really cool heels.

1360
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:47,621
(Glancing)

1361
00:52:47,691 --> 00:52:49,591
She's on heels for the battle.

1362
00:52:53,491 --> 00:52:55,091
Gabee's wearing heels.

1363
00:52:55,831 --> 00:52:58,500
I hope Gabee's going against you.

1364
00:52:58,501 --> 00:53:00,531
I think I am. She keeps eyeing me off.

1365
00:53:01,831 --> 00:53:04,070
She's probably intimidated by me now.

1366
00:53:04,071 --> 00:53:05,071
Good for her.

1367
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:07,541
I got her in the back. Watch it.

1368
00:53:07,971 --> 00:53:08,971
I got her.

1369
00:53:09,971 --> 00:53:11,311
It's annoying.

1370
00:53:11,841 --> 00:53:12,841
Rip it.

1371
00:53:13,181 --> 00:53:16,251
Please, Lord. Come on.

1372
00:53:16,781 --> 00:53:19,350
Proving ourselves that we're a stronger group...

1373
00:53:19,351 --> 00:53:20,521
than the other crews.

1374
00:53:21,521 --> 00:53:24,260
Happy to win against ROYAL FAMILY...

1375
00:53:24,261 --> 00:53:27,160
because if not, that's embarrassing.

1376
00:53:27,161 --> 00:53:31,330
Battling is something I'm best at in my life.

1377
00:53:31,331 --> 00:53:32,461
I'm going to win no matter what.

1378
00:53:33,131 --> 00:53:35,500
Get ready to battle us on the floor.

1379
00:53:35,501 --> 00:53:37,901
I need to show you who's the battle dancer.

1380
00:53:38,901 --> 00:53:40,971
(No Respect World Battle finally begins.)

1381
00:53:41,311 --> 00:53:42,871
(New ROYAL FAMILY versus old ROYAL FAMILY.)

1382
00:53:43,071 --> 00:53:44,080
(I'm going to beat you.)

1383
00:53:44,081 --> 00:53:45,081
(Know your place.)

1384
00:53:45,082 --> 00:53:47,010
(RHTokyo is basically Rie Hata's one-man team.)

1385
00:53:47,011 --> 00:53:48,310
(OSAKA Ojo Gang can't even unite.)

1386
00:53:48,311 --> 00:53:49,910
(Osaka versus Tokyo)

1387
00:53:49,911 --> 00:53:51,421
(The real hip-hop battle)

1388
00:53:51,621 --> 00:53:52,950
(BUMSUP's going down.)

1389
00:53:52,951 --> 00:53:54,191
(Are they disregarding us?)

1390
00:53:54,291 --> 00:53:55,450
(You know you're going to get beaten.)

1391
00:53:55,451 --> 00:53:56,790
(The war began the moment they were pointed as the weakest dancer.)

1392
00:53:56,791 --> 00:53:58,190
(I'll do anything to win.)

1393
00:53:58,191 --> 00:54:00,691
(Which crew's going to win the No Respect World Battle?)

1394
00:54:01,131 --> 00:54:02,490
(I'm so scared.)

1395
00:54:02,491 --> 00:54:05,700
Now, I will introduce three fight judges...

1396
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:08,500
who will evaluate your dance battle.

1397
00:54:08,501 --> 00:54:10,270
Let's go.

1398
00:54:10,271 --> 00:54:11,670
Do you think there will be an American?

1399
00:54:11,671 --> 00:54:13,200
Who are they?

1400
00:54:13,201 --> 00:54:14,740
Okay. I'm curious.

1401
00:54:14,741 --> 00:54:16,940
The producer who pioneered K-pop...

1402
00:54:16,941 --> 00:54:18,840
as well as a performer who completes the stage.

1403
00:54:18,841 --> 00:54:21,511
It's the legendary artist. Park Jin Young.

1404
00:54:23,451 --> 00:54:24,720
(Everyone's surprised.)

1405
00:54:24,721 --> 00:54:25,780
Really?

1406
00:54:25,781 --> 00:54:26,850
Park Jin Young?

1407
00:54:26,851 --> 00:54:27,851
- What?
- Really?

1408
00:54:30,921 --> 00:54:32,590
(K-pop's living legend appears.)

1409
00:54:32,591 --> 00:54:34,931
(What are you doing here?)

1410
00:54:37,661 --> 00:54:40,700
When I first saw him in person, I was shocked.

1411
00:54:40,701 --> 00:54:42,131
He's actually here.

1412
00:54:43,031 --> 00:54:45,300
We said we'd need someone like Park Jin Young.

1413
00:54:45,301 --> 00:54:47,541
I didn't expect him to come.

1414
00:54:48,071 --> 00:54:51,411
Park Jin Young is the history of K-pop.

1415
00:54:52,511 --> 00:54:55,010
(He's good at dancing...)

1416
00:54:55,011 --> 00:54:56,780
(and performing as well.)

1417
00:54:56,781 --> 00:54:58,520
(The K-pop legend...)

1418
00:54:58,521 --> 00:55:00,321
(as well as the true artist on the stage)

1419
00:55:01,721 --> 00:55:04,060
(Legend of legends)

1420
00:55:04,061 --> 00:55:06,691
(Park Jin Young)

1421
00:55:07,231 --> 00:55:09,890
For me, I always have seen him just on a screen.

1422
00:55:09,891 --> 00:55:12,400
He's the CEO of TWICE's company.

1423
00:55:12,401 --> 00:55:14,500
He is also a singer.

1424
00:55:14,501 --> 00:55:16,730
Really weird to see him in real life.

1425
00:55:16,731 --> 00:55:19,040
I know that he's got a lot of experience.

1426
00:55:19,041 --> 00:55:22,010
So I knew that he was going to have a lot of strong opinions.

1427
00:55:22,011 --> 00:55:24,081
It's crazy. He's so cool.

1428
00:55:25,011 --> 00:55:27,681
He has what it takes to be the judge.

1429
00:55:29,351 --> 00:55:31,450
In the previous season,

1430
00:55:31,451 --> 00:55:33,581
he left a strong impression as a special judge.

1431
00:55:34,321 --> 00:55:37,460
The leader of the world-famous dance crew, Kinjaz.

1432
00:55:37,461 --> 00:55:38,991
Mike Song.

1433
00:55:39,161 --> 00:55:40,491
Mike Song.

1434
00:55:42,731 --> 00:55:43,901
I love Mike Song.

1435
00:55:44,001 --> 00:55:46,001
(Applauding automatically)

1436
00:55:49,431 --> 00:55:50,771
Let's go, Mike.

1437
00:55:50,841 --> 00:55:52,100
Let's go, big Mike.

1438
00:55:52,101 --> 00:55:54,871
Mike Song is the top in the American choreography scene.

1439
00:55:55,241 --> 00:55:57,681
He's also been the previous judge.

1440
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,950
(He appeared as the special judge in previous seasons.)

1441
00:56:01,951 --> 00:56:06,921
(Mike Song left remarkable comments with his wit and sharp perspective.)

1442
00:56:07,391 --> 00:56:09,720
The "feel" guy.

1443
00:56:09,721 --> 00:56:12,920
He makes comments that are touching...

1444
00:56:12,921 --> 00:56:14,930
- and convincing.
- The "feel" guy.

1445
00:56:14,931 --> 00:56:17,400
He's also good at making comments in Korean too.

1446
00:56:17,401 --> 00:56:19,631
He's good at evaluating people, and he makes it fun.

1447
00:56:20,061 --> 00:56:24,440
I thought he was the perfect fight judge.

1448
00:56:24,441 --> 00:56:26,800
The last judge is...

1449
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:28,641
a special judge.

1450
00:56:28,941 --> 00:56:30,240
Who is it?

1451
00:56:30,241 --> 00:56:31,581
Who's the judge?

1452
00:56:31,811 --> 00:56:33,711
Hip-hop and high heels.

1453
00:56:34,111 --> 00:56:36,150
She puts on powerful performances.

1454
00:56:36,151 --> 00:56:39,320
The dance director with the powerful energy.

1455
00:56:39,321 --> 00:56:41,121
Aliya Janell.

1456
00:56:43,051 --> 00:56:44,321
(Exclaiming)

1457
00:56:45,121 --> 00:56:46,921
(No way.)

1458
00:56:46,961 --> 00:56:48,961
I'm dead.

1459
00:56:49,161 --> 00:56:51,830
(Everyone exclaims when they hear Aliya Janell's name.)

1460
00:56:51,831 --> 00:56:53,331
Is she really in Korea?

1461
00:56:55,571 --> 00:56:57,300
(The queen appears.)

1462
00:56:57,301 --> 00:56:59,040
(Squealing like a dolphin)

1463
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:01,040
(Excited)

1464
00:57:01,041 --> 00:57:02,871
(Oh, my gosh.)

1465
00:57:03,771 --> 00:57:05,281
Aliya Janell is known for heels.

1466
00:57:05,611 --> 00:57:08,281
She's a very famous heel dancer.

1467
00:57:08,411 --> 00:57:10,111
Oh, my gosh.

1468
00:57:10,881 --> 00:57:12,720
(Making...)

1469
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:15,591
(a big fuss)

1470
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:17,661
(Uniting all 6 crews)

1471
00:57:17,961 --> 00:57:20,361
(Who is the special judge, Aliya Janell?)

1472
00:57:20,631 --> 00:57:23,090
(She collaborated with famous global artists...)

1473
00:57:23,091 --> 00:57:25,561
(including Beyonce and Nicki Minaj.)

1474
00:57:25,861 --> 00:57:29,070
(She explodes with energy even on heels...)

1475
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:34,041
(and shows firm elegant moves.)

1476
00:57:35,441 --> 00:57:38,741
(Aliya Janell is a global dancer as well as the icon of heel dance.)

1477
00:57:41,011 --> 00:57:42,710
(Everybody)

1478
00:57:42,711 --> 00:57:45,521
(It's a dance party.)

1479
00:57:45,751 --> 00:57:47,950
I was so happy to meet her...

1480
00:57:47,951 --> 00:57:49,920
- in person.
- I've only seen her videos.

1481
00:57:49,921 --> 00:57:53,520
For the longest time since I was young, I've loved her.

1482
00:57:53,521 --> 00:57:54,530
- Okay.
- Hi.

1483
00:57:54,531 --> 00:57:55,531
(It's Aliya Janell time.)

1484
00:57:58,031 --> 00:57:59,600
(Overwhelming the atmosphere)

1485
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:02,671
(The fight zone is already getting so hot from the start.)

1486
00:58:03,901 --> 00:58:06,070
Nice to see that she was in the room,

1487
00:58:06,071 --> 00:58:07,440
and it means a lot to me.

1488
00:58:07,441 --> 00:58:10,610
Just being judged by her is amazing.

1489
00:58:10,611 --> 00:58:12,280
I was like, "Yes! I'm going to do my best."

1490
00:58:12,281 --> 00:58:13,341
I became enthusiastic.

1491
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:17,050
Now, I will tell you...

1492
00:58:17,051 --> 00:58:19,450
how No Respect World Battle works.

1493
00:58:19,451 --> 00:58:21,750
No Respect World Battle will be...

1494
00:58:21,751 --> 00:58:26,120
divided into the first half and the team match in the second half.

1495
00:58:26,121 --> 00:58:27,460
When the battle begins,

1496
00:58:27,461 --> 00:58:30,660
you're given 40 seconds of battle time.

1497
00:58:30,661 --> 00:58:33,100
The dancer who picks goes first.

1498
00:58:33,101 --> 00:58:36,030
The dancer who is picked goes second.

1499
00:58:36,031 --> 00:58:37,230
When the battle is over,

1500
00:58:37,231 --> 00:58:40,970
the fight judges will raise the cards to decide the result.

1501
00:58:40,971 --> 00:58:45,010
The dancer who gets picked by more than two judges...

1502
00:58:45,011 --> 00:58:46,011
wins.

1503
00:58:46,281 --> 00:58:50,451
However, if judges can't decide at once,

1504
00:58:50,651 --> 00:58:53,180
both dancers will dance at the same time...

1505
00:58:53,181 --> 00:58:55,650
and battle again.

1506
00:58:55,651 --> 00:58:58,820
The result chips given depending on the battle...

1507
00:58:58,821 --> 00:59:02,630
are expected to be posted on your crew scoreboard.

1508
00:59:02,631 --> 00:59:04,260
Fight Judge Park Jin Young.

1509
00:59:04,261 --> 00:59:06,860
What is your evaluation standard?

1510
00:59:06,861 --> 00:59:08,871
Of course, technique.

1511
00:59:09,301 --> 00:59:12,600
The second will be creativity.

1512
00:59:12,601 --> 00:59:16,140
You have to show me something that I wasn't expecting.

1513
00:59:16,141 --> 00:59:19,380
You have to give me emotions behind your moves.

1514
00:59:19,381 --> 00:59:20,880
When I look around,

1515
00:59:20,881 --> 00:59:24,120
I see dance legends, world champions...

1516
00:59:24,121 --> 00:59:25,520
I see community leaders.

1517
00:59:25,521 --> 00:59:27,690
And so I just want to give a big shout-out.

1518
00:59:27,691 --> 00:59:29,720
I feel like it's just going to be who wants it more today.

1519
00:59:29,721 --> 00:59:30,790
Straight up.

1520
00:59:30,791 --> 00:59:31,821
Okay.

1521
00:59:33,561 --> 00:59:35,130
Mine is going to be really simple.

1522
00:59:35,131 --> 00:59:36,760
What I'm looking for...

1523
00:59:36,761 --> 00:59:38,931
is someone to get me out of my seat.

1524
00:59:39,331 --> 00:59:40,400
Okay?

1525
00:59:40,401 --> 00:59:42,271
- Period.
- Yes.

1526
00:59:42,401 --> 00:59:45,671
So that's what we're looking for. Just have so much fun.

1527
00:59:45,841 --> 00:59:49,840
(All 6 crews, let's go!)

1528
00:59:49,841 --> 00:59:52,511
(Spirit of the tiger, let's go!)

1529
00:59:52,941 --> 00:59:56,411
Lastly, the person who will be playing the battle music.

1530
00:59:56,951 --> 00:59:59,051
DJ SOM.

1531
01:00:01,491 --> 01:00:05,121
(Make some noise!)

1532
01:00:05,221 --> 01:00:08,560
No Respect World Battle.

1533
01:00:08,561 --> 01:00:11,461
We will now begin the first round, the solo battle.

1534
01:00:15,701 --> 01:00:17,601
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1535
01:00:18,071 --> 01:00:20,500
There was a heavy sense of pressure in the air.

1536
01:00:20,501 --> 01:00:23,171
We're really here representing Korea.

1537
01:00:23,241 --> 01:00:24,241
We have to do well.

1538
01:00:24,611 --> 01:00:26,110
I'm about to show everyone...

1539
01:00:26,111 --> 01:00:28,211
that we deserve to represent the US.

1540
01:00:28,581 --> 01:00:30,610
We came all the way here from Australia,

1541
01:00:30,611 --> 01:00:32,421
so we're not here for fun.

1542
01:00:32,621 --> 01:00:34,750
Team New Zealand is ready to come in...

1543
01:00:34,751 --> 01:00:36,590
and eat up all the crews.

1544
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,921
We'll prove that RHTokyo is the best.

1545
01:00:39,721 --> 01:00:42,030
If we're comparing individual dance skills,

1546
01:00:42,031 --> 01:00:44,701
OSAKA Ojo Gang will come on top.

1547
01:00:44,961 --> 01:00:47,901
The first battle dancer of the first round...

1548
01:00:48,631 --> 01:00:51,241
(Who will be the first to start off the No Respect World Battle?)

1549
01:00:51,771 --> 01:00:52,970
Let's do this, Ruthy.

1550
01:00:52,971 --> 01:00:54,141
Who do you think it is?

1551
01:00:54,341 --> 01:00:57,711
is from Team Korea. She is BUMSUP's...

1552
01:00:58,081 --> 01:00:59,281
Honey J.

1553
01:01:00,441 --> 01:01:04,120
- Let's go, Leader!
- You got this!

1554
01:01:04,121 --> 01:01:05,250
(Honey J, the leader of BUMSUP)

1555
01:01:05,251 --> 01:01:06,751
It's the leader of Team Korea.

1556
01:01:07,491 --> 01:01:08,651
Gosh, wait.

1557
01:01:09,121 --> 01:01:10,420
(Nervous)

1558
01:01:10,421 --> 01:01:11,790
It's Honey J.

1559
01:01:11,791 --> 01:01:13,291
Need I say more?

1560
01:01:13,491 --> 01:01:15,661
She's the winner of Season One.

1561
01:01:15,891 --> 01:01:18,630
(Honey J is the leader of HolyBang, a female hip-hop dance crew.)

1562
01:01:18,631 --> 01:01:20,630
(HolyBang's legendary performance was a result...)

1563
01:01:20,631 --> 01:01:22,630
(of her skills and leadership.)

1564
01:01:22,631 --> 01:01:26,140
(Not only is she a leader who led her crew to victory,)

1565
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:31,040
(but, having been in the Korean street dance scene for 26 years,)

1566
01:01:31,041 --> 01:01:33,810
(she's also the pioneer of girls' hip-hop in Korea.)

1567
01:01:33,811 --> 01:01:35,251
She'll definitely be a strong competitor.

1568
01:01:35,381 --> 01:01:37,180
She's a leader for a reason.

1569
01:01:37,181 --> 01:01:38,620
Just from the way she dances,

1570
01:01:38,621 --> 01:01:40,781
you can tell she's a superstar.

1571
01:01:41,591 --> 01:01:43,951
Honey J of BUMSUP, Team Korea.

1572
01:01:44,191 --> 01:01:47,391
Please select a dancer you know you can win against.

1573
01:01:48,091 --> 01:01:49,561
Gosh, I'm nervous.

1574
01:01:50,731 --> 01:01:51,831
No, I'm not nervous.

1575
01:01:52,261 --> 01:01:55,431
The dancer I know I can win against is...

1576
01:01:57,271 --> 01:02:01,071
(Who will Honey J choose as the No Respect Dancer?)

1577
01:02:01,711 --> 01:02:03,141
This is going to be very fun.

1578
01:02:03,911 --> 01:02:05,841
(Honey J charges forward without hesitation.)

1579
01:02:07,581 --> 01:02:08,581
(Gasping)

1580
01:02:09,951 --> 01:02:12,681
Team USA, MOTIV. Marlee.

1581
01:02:14,491 --> 01:02:16,951
- Goodness.
- Marlee!

1582
01:02:18,461 --> 01:02:20,261
Let's go!

1583
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:23,231
(MOTIV's leader, Marlee, has been chosen as the No Respect Dancer.)

1584
01:02:24,061 --> 01:02:25,330
Let's go.

1585
01:02:25,331 --> 01:02:27,501
This is so cool.

1586
01:02:27,731 --> 01:02:32,101
This will be a battle between Team Korea and Team USA.

1587
01:02:32,371 --> 01:02:34,941
She knew exactly who she wanted to go for.

1588
01:02:35,141 --> 01:02:36,471
The leaders of the hip-hop teams.

1589
01:02:36,841 --> 01:02:38,780
- Do you know about Marlee?
- No, who's that?

1590
01:02:38,781 --> 01:02:40,281
Marlee's amazing.

1591
01:02:40,911 --> 01:02:43,110
She's been making a lot of noise right now.

1592
01:02:43,111 --> 01:02:44,781
She's totally killing it.

1593
01:02:45,581 --> 01:02:47,520
(Back when the crew lineup was revealed)

1594
01:02:47,521 --> 01:02:50,190
- No.
- Not her.

1595
01:02:50,191 --> 01:02:52,560
(Everyone lost it right after Marlee was revealed.)

1596
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:55,830
Everyone who's anyone among the dancers knows her.

1597
01:02:55,831 --> 01:02:57,291
She's like a rising star.

1598
01:02:57,361 --> 01:02:59,730
She's a choreographer and a battle dancer.

1599
01:02:59,731 --> 01:03:00,931
She's so amazing.

1600
01:03:01,431 --> 01:03:02,700
(They all feel faint.)

1601
01:03:02,701 --> 01:03:05,771
Marlee, for sure, will kill it in battles.

1602
01:03:05,801 --> 01:03:09,140
Even though there are so many battle dancer in the world...

1603
01:03:09,141 --> 01:03:10,141
(Marlee is the best one.)

1604
01:03:10,142 --> 01:03:12,380
Battle dancers in the US are just like...

1605
01:03:12,381 --> 01:03:13,781
A little more rough.

1606
01:03:14,111 --> 01:03:17,310
Marlee has a really distinct style,

1607
01:03:17,311 --> 01:03:20,421
because she keeps the essence of hip-hop within her dance.

1608
01:03:20,681 --> 01:03:22,120
Because we're from America.

1609
01:03:22,121 --> 01:03:24,121
We're from where hip-hop began.

1610
01:03:25,391 --> 01:03:26,860
Honey J.

1611
01:03:26,861 --> 01:03:28,560
(When they stepped into the fight zone)

1612
01:03:28,561 --> 01:03:30,630
From what I've seen,

1613
01:03:30,631 --> 01:03:32,900
I haven't seen anything that I can't do, yet.

1614
01:03:32,901 --> 01:03:34,430
It says that she does hip-hop.

1615
01:03:34,431 --> 01:03:37,471
I've kind of expected more.

1616
01:03:37,741 --> 01:03:38,901
That's all.

1617
01:03:40,901 --> 01:03:44,170
The hip-hop that she does is maybe more commercial,

1618
01:03:44,171 --> 01:03:48,511
whereas the hip-hop that we do is more foundational.

1619
01:03:48,951 --> 01:03:52,520
Do not think that all the dancers on this show are...

1620
01:03:52,521 --> 01:03:53,621
real hip-hop.

1621
01:03:54,821 --> 01:03:56,121
Real hip-hop.

1622
01:03:57,151 --> 01:03:58,520
Did she just say "real hip-hop?"

1623
01:03:58,521 --> 01:03:59,660
(Did she say we're not real hip-hop?)

1624
01:03:59,661 --> 01:04:01,131
Did she say we're not real hip-hop?

1625
01:04:01,331 --> 01:04:04,130
It felt as if they were looking down on what she'd done.

1626
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:06,600
The way they underestimated me was infuriating.

1627
01:04:06,601 --> 01:04:09,031
You've messed with the wrong person.

1628
01:04:09,271 --> 01:04:12,301
I also felt a sense of responsibility about Korea.

1629
01:04:13,471 --> 01:04:17,410
Honey J came up to me with a lot of confidence.

1630
01:04:17,411 --> 01:04:20,211
I saw her face, and I was like, "She's mad."

1631
01:04:20,311 --> 01:04:22,611
Since when was there an answer to hip-hop?

1632
01:04:22,911 --> 01:04:26,681
I want to show the birthplace of hip-hop how good Korea is.

1633
01:04:27,521 --> 01:04:29,451
In Korea, Honey J is hip-hop.

1634
01:04:29,751 --> 01:04:31,491
Show them what you've got.

1635
01:04:31,691 --> 01:04:34,991
Honey J was definitely in over her head choosing Marlee.

1636
01:04:35,061 --> 01:04:36,960
When Honey J pointed at me,

1637
01:04:36,961 --> 01:04:38,731
I was excited.

1638
01:04:38,831 --> 01:04:41,400
Because I think it's my opportunity to prove...

1639
01:04:41,401 --> 01:04:43,430
that I can dominate...

1640
01:04:43,431 --> 01:04:45,541
a leader that has won.

1641
01:04:46,201 --> 01:04:48,810
The pride of Korean girls' hip-hop.

1642
01:04:48,811 --> 01:04:51,410
Honey J of Team Korea, BUMSUP, versus...

1643
01:04:51,411 --> 01:04:55,511
Marlee, an authentic hip-hop dancer of Team USA, MOTIV.

1644
01:04:56,311 --> 01:04:58,380
Hip-hop dancing.

1645
01:04:58,381 --> 01:05:00,420
Aren't both of them really strong competitors?

1646
01:05:00,421 --> 01:05:02,821
- Let's go. I need to stand up.
- This is going to be great.

1647
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:04,990
This is going to be such a good battle.

1648
01:05:04,991 --> 01:05:06,791
Mike, what would you be thinking about, right now?

1649
01:05:06,891 --> 01:05:09,190
I feel like Marlee's a character that...

1650
01:05:09,191 --> 01:05:10,860
- maybe not everybody knows about.
- Right.

1651
01:05:10,861 --> 01:05:13,800
But then, Honey J is a total leader in Korea.

1652
01:05:13,801 --> 01:05:15,400
She's the past winner of the show.

1653
01:05:15,401 --> 01:05:17,741
There's a lot of weight in this battle.

1654
01:05:19,271 --> 01:05:21,570
The hip-hop cultures of Korea and America...

1655
01:05:21,571 --> 01:05:23,471
will be going head-to-head.

1656
01:05:23,911 --> 01:05:26,441
Let's begin the battle between these two dancers.

1657
01:05:26,911 --> 01:05:28,011
Ready?

1658
01:05:28,481 --> 01:05:30,150
(Let's go!)

1659
01:05:30,151 --> 01:05:32,120
Let's go, Honey J!

1660
01:05:32,121 --> 01:05:33,221
Fight!

1661
01:05:34,691 --> 01:05:36,420
(BUMSUP's Honey J goes first.)

1662
01:05:36,421 --> 01:05:38,191
I'm the leader among leaders.

1663
01:05:38,291 --> 01:05:39,391
I definitely have to win.

1664
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:40,661
Go on, then.

1665
01:05:47,831 --> 01:05:48,970
(This is already so much fun.)

1666
01:05:48,971 --> 01:05:50,371
It didn't intimidate me.

1667
01:05:52,641 --> 01:05:53,901
(Let's go, Honey J!)

1668
01:05:59,881 --> 01:06:01,851
I wanted to put on a show.

1669
01:06:03,651 --> 01:06:04,720
She's so cool.

1670
01:06:04,721 --> 01:06:06,481
I wanted to show them what I was capable of.

1671
01:06:08,451 --> 01:06:09,651
Those legs.

1672
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:11,091
(Chill, she's our opponent.)

1673
01:06:15,861 --> 01:06:17,131
Stop that!

1674
01:06:21,101 --> 01:06:24,171
I think she's got great energy, but it looks easy.

1675
01:06:28,341 --> 01:06:30,211
Okay!

1676
01:06:30,911 --> 01:06:31,911
It isn't enough.

1677
01:06:36,811 --> 01:06:38,081
What is she doing?

1678
01:06:38,251 --> 01:06:40,321
Okay, I have to engage with her.

1679
01:06:41,621 --> 01:06:43,021
Don't let her get to you.

1680
01:06:43,121 --> 01:06:44,761
She knows how to get on someone's nerves.

1681
01:06:45,021 --> 01:06:46,861
I just have to do mine.

1682
01:06:51,761 --> 01:06:52,761
- Yes!
- Yes!

1683
01:06:53,461 --> 01:06:56,030
Countdown! Five, four,

1684
01:06:56,031 --> 01:06:58,841
three, two, one.

1685
01:06:59,001 --> 01:07:01,001
Switch to MOTIV's Marlee!

1686
01:07:01,271 --> 01:07:02,341
Let's go!

1687
01:07:02,941 --> 01:07:04,681
The birthplace of hip-hop? Show me what you got.

1688
01:07:05,581 --> 01:07:07,440
I need to be strategic.

1689
01:07:07,441 --> 01:07:09,810
It's important to not only dance well,

1690
01:07:09,811 --> 01:07:11,721
- but also know how to perform.
- Let's go!

1691
01:07:13,421 --> 01:07:14,851
(Make some noise!)

1692
01:07:21,021 --> 01:07:22,160
(Amazed)

1693
01:07:22,161 --> 01:07:23,361
(The crowd is going wild.)

1694
01:07:25,401 --> 01:07:26,461
I'm not scared.

1695
01:07:27,061 --> 01:07:29,331
I can very easily overpower her.

1696
01:07:30,231 --> 01:07:31,440
(Blown away)

1697
01:07:31,441 --> 01:07:33,570
Let's do this, then. Come on.

1698
01:07:33,571 --> 01:07:35,241
They're standing so close!

1699
01:07:38,441 --> 01:07:39,781
I can't back away.

1700
01:07:41,881 --> 01:07:43,110
(Now this is a dance battle!)

1701
01:07:43,111 --> 01:07:44,411
They're being very aggressive.

1702
01:07:45,051 --> 01:07:46,451
There was beef.

1703
01:07:49,291 --> 01:07:50,950
(Making crow sounds)

1704
01:07:50,951 --> 01:07:52,561
(She's quick-witted.)

1705
01:07:56,431 --> 01:07:59,261
It felt as if she was filling her performance with showmanship.

1706
01:08:02,801 --> 01:08:03,801
Good luck.

1707
01:08:05,201 --> 01:08:06,901
The way she was dancing was infuriating.

1708
01:08:11,041 --> 01:08:12,081
Let's go.

1709
01:08:12,511 --> 01:08:13,511
(Just then, Marlee points to BUMSUP.)

1710
01:08:14,711 --> 01:08:16,880
I was telling them that they were going down.

1711
01:08:16,881 --> 01:08:17,950
(She can't believe her eyes.)

1712
01:08:17,951 --> 01:08:19,020
(What?)

1713
01:08:19,021 --> 01:08:20,120
So what?

1714
01:08:20,121 --> 01:08:21,450
(That's our leader.)

1715
01:08:21,451 --> 01:08:22,651
I felt incredulous.

1716
01:08:25,461 --> 01:08:26,461
What?

1717
01:08:27,761 --> 01:08:29,130
(Those are my people.)

1718
01:08:29,131 --> 01:08:30,430
Those are my people.

1719
01:08:30,431 --> 01:08:33,361
You're battling just me, but you're always battling all of us.

1720
01:08:35,071 --> 01:08:36,271
(That's insane!)

1721
01:08:36,471 --> 01:08:37,471
(Stomping her feet)

1722
01:08:37,471 --> 01:08:38,471
Yes!

1723
01:08:39,371 --> 01:08:42,340
Countdown! Five, four,

1724
01:08:42,341 --> 01:08:45,280
three, two, one.

1725
01:08:45,281 --> 01:08:47,111
The battle is over!

1726
01:08:50,851 --> 01:08:51,980
You were amazing.

1727
01:08:51,981 --> 01:08:53,320
Now that was a battle.

1728
01:08:53,321 --> 01:08:54,920
Now that was a...

1729
01:08:54,921 --> 01:08:55,950
(She bleeped herself.)

1730
01:08:55,951 --> 01:08:58,121
You all are crazy too, but you all are crazy as well.

1731
01:08:58,421 --> 01:09:00,191
(That's our leader!)

1732
01:09:00,361 --> 01:09:02,461
It's over.

1733
01:09:02,931 --> 01:09:05,501
I know what I just did. I'm feeling confident.

1734
01:09:05,831 --> 01:09:07,500
Good morning!

1735
01:09:07,501 --> 01:09:08,931
Essence!

1736
01:09:09,871 --> 01:09:11,371
This is very aggravating.

1737
01:09:11,741 --> 01:09:12,801
Don't let them get to you!

1738
01:09:13,301 --> 01:09:15,041
Don't let your emotions overcome you!

1739
01:09:15,141 --> 01:09:16,411
Honey J, you did great!

1740
01:09:17,271 --> 01:09:20,681
Fight Judge Mike Song. What did you think of the battle?

1741
01:09:21,111 --> 01:09:25,350
The movement quality on both sides is just immaculate.

1742
01:09:25,351 --> 01:09:27,921
No matter what, these are masters of movements.

1743
01:09:28,021 --> 01:09:29,451
I think, just, Marlee...

1744
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:31,761
You had composure.

1745
01:09:31,861 --> 01:09:34,321
You had different types of spontaneity.

1746
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:36,391
You just had the complete package. You killed it.

1747
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:37,661
That's right.

1748
01:09:38,201 --> 01:09:40,800
Honey J, I really appreciate the energy.

1749
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:43,601
I appreciate the hype. Do you know what I'm saying?

1750
01:09:43,701 --> 01:09:45,501
You locked in. That was good.

1751
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:48,410
You got served. The battle.

1752
01:09:48,411 --> 01:09:50,471
Do you know what I'm saying? You got that one, man.

1753
01:09:52,011 --> 01:09:54,781
Let's check the result of the battle.

1754
01:09:56,511 --> 01:09:58,121
This is really nerve-racking.

1755
01:09:58,221 --> 01:10:00,020
It's a competition that's taking place in Korea.

1756
01:10:00,021 --> 01:10:02,121
I'm determined to win.

1757
01:10:02,221 --> 01:10:04,221
I know I beat Honey J.

1758
01:10:04,321 --> 01:10:06,491
I'm just waiting to hear that I won.

1759
01:10:06,761 --> 01:10:09,691
Fight Judges, open your cards.

1760
01:10:18,141 --> 01:10:21,440
With a score of 3 to 0, Marlee...

1761
01:10:21,441 --> 01:10:22,571
of Team USA, MOTIV wins.

1762
01:10:23,411 --> 01:10:26,411
- MOTIV!
- MOTIV!

1763
01:10:26,811 --> 01:10:28,380
(Leader Marlee puts the first winner's chip...)

1764
01:10:28,381 --> 01:10:29,510
(on the scoreboard.)

1765
01:10:29,511 --> 01:10:31,050
That's my leader. Yes.

1766
01:10:31,051 --> 01:10:32,781
That's my friend. Do you know what I mean?

1767
01:10:33,151 --> 01:10:35,120
That felt like a little taste of home.

1768
01:10:35,121 --> 01:10:37,590
Just like, the energy of the battle.

1769
01:10:37,591 --> 01:10:38,861
- I needed that.
- Yes.

1770
01:10:39,191 --> 01:10:41,730
I'm not only proud of myself. But I'm just proud...

1771
01:10:41,731 --> 01:10:44,061
that I represented my team well.

1772
01:10:45,531 --> 01:10:46,561
I was very disappointed.

1773
01:10:47,331 --> 01:10:49,571
Honey J, you had better preparations.

1774
01:10:49,671 --> 01:10:51,941
It was just that you were too stiff.

1775
01:10:52,541 --> 01:10:55,511
In your attempt to do well, your body froze up.

1776
01:10:55,811 --> 01:10:57,571
You were trying to prove too much.

1777
01:10:57,671 --> 01:10:59,981
I think my body was stiff indeed.

1778
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:02,350
I should've adjusted the strength,

1779
01:11:02,351 --> 01:11:05,981
but I failed due to pressure and nervousness.

1780
01:11:06,451 --> 01:11:07,980
- You did well.
- You did well.

1781
01:11:07,981 --> 01:11:10,520
- You're the best.
- You did well.

1782
01:11:10,521 --> 01:11:11,990
All of us have been leaders.

1783
01:11:11,991 --> 01:11:14,221
Thus, we know that feeling very well.

1784
01:11:14,321 --> 01:11:16,531
Honey J must've felt a lot of pressure.

1785
01:11:17,761 --> 01:11:19,931
The next battle dancer is...

1786
01:11:20,361 --> 01:11:21,831
I'm getting so nervous.

1787
01:11:21,931 --> 01:11:23,471
I want to just, like...

1788
01:11:24,471 --> 01:11:28,341
Team Australia, AG SQUAD's...

1789
01:11:28,441 --> 01:11:30,511
- Kyra or Ruthy Baby.
- Who will it be?

1790
01:11:31,171 --> 01:11:32,210
Aaliyah.

1791
01:11:32,211 --> 01:11:34,510
- Aaliyah.
- Let's go!

1792
01:11:34,511 --> 01:11:36,050
(Here comes our youngest member!)

1793
01:11:36,051 --> 01:11:37,380
Okay, Aaliyah.

1794
01:11:37,381 --> 01:11:38,381
Who is she?

1795
01:11:38,481 --> 01:11:40,381
- Do you know who she is?
- Alysha?

1796
01:11:40,821 --> 01:11:42,491
Oh, my gosh.

1797
01:11:47,161 --> 01:11:49,661
The dancer I can beat...

1798
01:11:50,631 --> 01:11:53,801
is in Team...

1799
01:11:54,131 --> 01:11:55,171
I think she'll pick us.

1800
01:11:55,801 --> 01:11:57,871
Korea.

1801
01:11:58,441 --> 01:11:59,871
Okay. Bring it on.

1802
01:12:00,401 --> 01:12:03,971
BUMSUP's Aiki. Get on the floor. Let's go.

1803
01:12:05,641 --> 01:12:06,781
(Me?)

1804
01:12:07,011 --> 01:12:09,111
You!

1805
01:12:10,351 --> 01:12:12,950
- Aiki, let's go.
- What's going on?

1806
01:12:12,951 --> 01:12:14,220
We tried not to think about them,

1807
01:12:14,221 --> 01:12:16,151
but they kept attacking us.

1808
01:12:17,521 --> 01:12:20,361
Team Australia said that we lacked teamwork in our performances.

1809
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:22,230
They put us in sixth place.

1810
01:12:22,231 --> 01:12:23,331
You're right.

1811
01:12:23,431 --> 01:12:24,661
- They should focus on themselves.
- Seriously.

1812
01:12:24,761 --> 01:12:25,800
It's annoying.

1813
01:12:25,801 --> 01:12:29,171
Did they put us in sixth place because they looked down on us?

1814
01:12:29,571 --> 01:12:30,571
And yes. That's it.

1815
01:12:30,572 --> 01:12:33,601
I think Korea is ranked sixth.

1816
01:12:33,701 --> 01:12:35,911
For sixth, we did BUMSUP.

1817
01:12:36,011 --> 01:12:37,670
- Underdog.
- Underdog.

1818
01:12:37,671 --> 01:12:39,211
- Yes.
- Sure.

1819
01:12:39,511 --> 01:12:40,511
(Come on, TikTok.)

1820
01:12:42,111 --> 01:12:43,480
(3 million followers, 71.7 million likes)

1821
01:12:43,481 --> 01:12:44,481
(Are you sure that's a million?)

1822
01:12:44,482 --> 01:12:47,081
(She bought the followers.)

1823
01:12:47,621 --> 01:12:49,351
(Entering the fight zone)

1824
01:12:50,851 --> 01:12:52,461
"Bought them?"

1825
01:12:53,221 --> 01:12:55,891
What did they say? I bought the followers?

1826
01:12:56,431 --> 01:12:58,731
Her dancing on TikTok was...

1827
01:12:58,831 --> 01:13:01,161
I just know that her movements, quality-wise...

1828
01:13:01,261 --> 01:13:03,171
You know? I can do TikTok too.

1829
01:13:04,331 --> 01:13:05,570
When I do TikTok,

1830
01:13:05,571 --> 01:13:08,171
all I need to do is stare at the camera and I get likes.

1831
01:13:08,271 --> 01:13:11,171
She has to do the most for the camera...

1832
01:13:11,271 --> 01:13:12,411
to get likes.

1833
01:13:13,781 --> 01:13:16,980
I chose Aiki as the No Respect Dancer...

1834
01:13:16,981 --> 01:13:18,881
that I wanted to win.

1835
01:13:19,081 --> 01:13:20,081
Boom!

1836
01:13:20,351 --> 01:13:21,950
(Just you wait.)

1837
01:13:21,951 --> 01:13:23,021
It made me angry.

1838
01:13:23,421 --> 01:13:25,161
Is she really looking down on me?

1839
01:13:25,821 --> 01:13:27,821
I hate being looked down on.

1840
01:13:27,921 --> 01:13:28,991
I'm so annoyed.

1841
01:13:34,161 --> 01:13:36,070
This one person keeps staring at me.

1842
01:13:36,071 --> 01:13:37,101
Which one?

1843
01:13:38,771 --> 01:13:39,871
Is it Aiki?

1844
01:13:41,071 --> 01:13:42,141
Crazy.

1845
01:13:42,641 --> 01:13:44,881
Aiki was looking at me a lot.

1846
01:13:46,481 --> 01:13:47,941
I thought it was funny.

1847
01:13:48,511 --> 01:13:52,821
I love it when people stare at me.

1848
01:13:53,881 --> 01:13:57,891
I was very excited. I wanted to show her what I've got.

1849
01:13:58,321 --> 01:14:01,691
Instead of enjoying the stage, I'll try to win.

1850
01:14:01,891 --> 01:14:04,431
Why so serious? You know you're going to get beaten.

1851
01:14:05,101 --> 01:14:06,231
Bang, bang, bang.

1852
01:14:06,331 --> 01:14:07,531
This is who I am.

1853
01:14:08,601 --> 01:14:10,831
I'm just here to have fun. I know...

1854
01:14:12,241 --> 01:14:14,701
I'm going to beat you.

1855
01:14:16,771 --> 01:14:18,171
That was crazy.

1856
01:14:18,381 --> 01:14:20,481
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

1857
01:14:20,711 --> 01:14:21,781
This is fun.

1858
01:14:22,811 --> 01:14:25,181
- Aaliyah.
- That's me.

1859
01:14:25,451 --> 01:14:27,781
I'll teach you a lesson today.

1860
01:14:30,521 --> 01:14:33,620
- She'll teach you a lesson.
- It's a play on word.

1861
01:14:33,621 --> 01:14:35,231
(Aliya is surprised.)

1862
01:14:35,491 --> 01:14:36,491
Take this!

1863
01:14:36,991 --> 01:14:38,131
She's provoking her too much.

1864
01:14:39,101 --> 01:14:40,201
(This is fun.)

1865
01:14:40,301 --> 01:14:42,500
Excuse me. Come on. Let's go.

1866
01:14:42,501 --> 01:14:44,001
I thought it was funny.

1867
01:14:44,101 --> 01:14:45,141
(Go away.)

1868
01:14:45,241 --> 01:14:48,371
(The war of nerves is insane.)

1869
01:14:48,471 --> 01:14:50,241
They'd just start pulling the fingers.

1870
01:14:50,911 --> 01:14:52,681
Team Australia's Aaliyah...

1871
01:14:52,881 --> 01:14:55,111
- versus Team Korea's Aiki.
- Let's go, Aiki.

1872
01:14:55,511 --> 01:14:58,051
The two dancers' battle will begin.

1873
01:14:58,381 --> 01:15:00,021
Ready? Fight!

1874
01:15:00,521 --> 01:15:01,620
(AG SQUAD's Aaliyah goes first.)

1875
01:15:01,621 --> 01:15:04,121
- Aiki!
- Let's go!

1876
01:15:04,221 --> 01:15:05,561
- Let's go!
- Oh, yes.

1877
01:15:06,191 --> 01:15:09,731
I was very excited. I wanted to show her what I got.

1878
01:15:10,661 --> 01:15:11,861
(Watch carefully.)

1879
01:15:13,061 --> 01:15:14,631
Let's go!

1880
01:15:16,901 --> 01:15:18,001
Yes!

1881
01:15:18,101 --> 01:15:19,201
She's a battle dancer.

1882
01:15:19,541 --> 01:15:20,541
It isn't very impressive.

1883
01:15:21,571 --> 01:15:22,611
Let's go!

1884
01:15:26,881 --> 01:15:27,911
Her body is flexible.

1885
01:15:32,681 --> 01:15:35,051
I don't really see her as a competition.

1886
01:15:38,291 --> 01:15:39,291
(Absorbed)

1887
01:15:40,591 --> 01:15:41,591
What's this?

1888
01:15:42,291 --> 01:15:43,431
I'm going to beat you.

1889
01:15:51,801 --> 01:15:53,841
Hey, don't stop.

1890
01:15:55,711 --> 01:15:56,811
What is she doing there?

1891
01:16:02,851 --> 01:16:04,581
Let's go!

1892
01:16:05,881 --> 01:16:07,981
Countdown. Five, four,

1893
01:16:08,391 --> 01:16:10,891
three, two, one.

1894
01:16:12,661 --> 01:16:15,231
Switch. BUMSUP's Aiki.

1895
01:16:15,431 --> 01:16:16,491
Period.

1896
01:16:17,891 --> 01:16:18,901
Bring it on.

1897
01:16:19,761 --> 01:16:22,131
I'll show you how crazy I am.

1898
01:16:22,331 --> 01:16:23,871
That's the perfect song for her.

1899
01:16:23,971 --> 01:16:25,000
I'm excited.

1900
01:16:25,001 --> 01:16:26,570
- Aiki, let's go!
- Let's go!

1901
01:16:26,571 --> 01:16:28,971
Hey! Let's go!

1902
01:16:32,611 --> 01:16:33,611
Let's go!

1903
01:16:39,421 --> 01:16:40,851
I don't get it.

1904
01:16:42,391 --> 01:16:44,220
It doesn't make me feel anything.

1905
01:16:44,221 --> 01:16:46,360
This is fun. I'll win no matter what.

1906
01:16:46,361 --> 01:16:47,761
Let's go! Hey!

1907
01:16:52,501 --> 01:16:53,501
She's fire.

1908
01:16:56,101 --> 01:16:58,801
Full of confidence. But you know you're going to get beaten.

1909
01:17:00,001 --> 01:17:01,501
Let's go!

1910
01:17:03,241 --> 01:17:04,371
She's so rude.

1911
01:17:05,011 --> 01:17:06,011
It's so scary.

1912
01:17:08,011 --> 01:17:09,011
I'm so angry.

1913
01:17:11,851 --> 01:17:12,921
Hey!

1914
01:17:15,421 --> 01:17:16,421
(One last shot)

1915
01:17:17,391 --> 01:17:18,391
What the...

1916
01:17:19,491 --> 01:17:20,491
I'll win.

1917
01:17:21,561 --> 01:17:23,291
Aiki!

1918
01:17:26,401 --> 01:17:27,631
Oh, girl.

1919
01:17:27,731 --> 01:17:29,701
Countdown! Five, four,

1920
01:17:30,101 --> 01:17:32,770
three, two, one.

1921
01:17:32,771 --> 01:17:34,640
The battle is over.

1922
01:17:34,641 --> 01:17:35,641
(Torn)

1923
01:17:35,642 --> 01:17:37,510
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

1924
01:17:37,511 --> 01:17:38,511
What just happened?

1925
01:17:39,741 --> 01:17:40,811
(She did this.)

1926
01:17:41,881 --> 01:17:44,711
(Aaliyah provokes Aiki even after the battle.)

1927
01:17:45,051 --> 01:17:46,121
Well done.

1928
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:48,891
Let's go, sister.

1929
01:17:49,491 --> 01:17:51,021
It was very annoying.

1930
01:17:53,021 --> 01:17:54,161
I bumped into her slightly...

1931
01:17:54,961 --> 01:17:55,991
and she overreacted so much.

1932
01:17:57,231 --> 01:17:58,231
She's a bit annoying.

1933
01:17:59,201 --> 01:18:01,100
This setup is a bit annoying.

1934
01:18:01,101 --> 01:18:02,131
Right?

1935
01:18:02,801 --> 01:18:05,171
- She's staring at her.
- Oh, yes.

1936
01:18:06,341 --> 01:18:07,771
She didn't blink for a second.

1937
01:18:09,511 --> 01:18:11,641
Oh, no. It's no joke even after the battle.

1938
01:18:12,811 --> 01:18:13,811
I thought that I'd win.

1939
01:18:14,441 --> 01:18:16,111
I was actually laughing. I won.

1940
01:18:17,511 --> 01:18:21,081
Let's first hear from Fight Judge Park Jin Young.

1941
01:18:21,351 --> 01:18:24,390
The best part that I loved from what Aaliyah did was...

1942
01:18:24,391 --> 01:18:27,061
You picked a different rhythm to bounce to...

1943
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:28,790
instead of the downbeat.

1944
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:30,460
How you bounced...

1945
01:18:30,461 --> 01:18:32,661
and found a different rhythm in the track was...

1946
01:18:33,261 --> 01:18:34,730
very unpredictable.

1947
01:18:34,731 --> 01:18:36,701
That was the best part of your performance.

1948
01:18:37,071 --> 01:18:38,771
Regarding Aiki,

1949
01:18:39,371 --> 01:18:43,041
the skills were crazy and the details were amazing.

1950
01:18:44,711 --> 01:18:48,281
You entered with your "I'll teach you a lesson" pun.

1951
01:18:48,951 --> 01:18:50,651
(I'll teach you a lesson today.)

1952
01:18:50,751 --> 01:18:52,851
(They loved it.)

1953
01:18:52,951 --> 01:18:56,521
All that is the side of Aiki that I respect so much.

1954
01:18:57,051 --> 01:18:59,361
You guys were bringing something so different.

1955
01:18:59,461 --> 01:19:01,061
It was really hard to compare.

1956
01:19:01,621 --> 01:19:04,091
Let's check the result of the battle.

1957
01:19:04,291 --> 01:19:05,701
Short hair versus short hair.

1958
01:19:06,901 --> 01:19:07,901
Aiki will win this one.

1959
01:19:08,431 --> 01:19:09,431
She ate that.

1960
01:19:09,631 --> 01:19:12,471
Fight Judges, open your cards.

1961
01:19:13,201 --> 01:19:14,201
I must win.

1962
01:19:15,241 --> 01:19:16,241
I won.

1963
01:19:17,841 --> 01:19:19,381
I don't know.

1964
01:19:19,881 --> 01:19:22,280
I can't believe it. This one is hard.

1965
01:19:22,281 --> 01:19:23,311
(Whom did the fight judges choose?)

1966
01:19:26,621 --> 01:19:27,621
Yes!

1967
01:19:27,621 --> 01:19:28,621
(AG SQUAD 3: BUMSUP 0)

1968
01:19:28,621 --> 01:19:29,621
Go!

1969
01:19:29,622 --> 01:19:31,851
(We're proud of you.)

1970
01:19:32,921 --> 01:19:34,161
(We won.)

1971
01:19:34,391 --> 01:19:38,130
Yes! I did get the first victory for AG.

1972
01:19:38,131 --> 01:19:40,561
It made my team very proud.

1973
01:19:41,861 --> 01:19:43,201
It's the victory dance.

1974
01:19:44,901 --> 01:19:47,071
Aiki was there crying, but...

1975
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:50,641
that doesn't stop me from hitting a little dance.

1976
01:19:51,011 --> 01:19:53,141
(She's excited.)

1977
01:19:53,781 --> 01:19:56,381
It's okay.

1978
01:19:56,511 --> 01:19:57,981
- It's okay.
- I was very disappointed.

1979
01:19:59,351 --> 01:20:01,180
Look. I promise I didn't choose Aaliyah...

1980
01:20:01,181 --> 01:20:02,750
because her name is Aaliyah.

1981
01:20:02,751 --> 01:20:03,990
I did not.

1982
01:20:03,991 --> 01:20:05,760
I needed you to stay in there.

1983
01:20:05,761 --> 01:20:08,021
Stay in there. Even keep going until...

1984
01:20:09,531 --> 01:20:11,390
Not until the music turns off, but like...

1985
01:20:11,391 --> 01:20:13,001
I just feel like you walked away.

1986
01:20:14,431 --> 01:20:16,100
At the end, I was so flustered...

1987
01:20:16,101 --> 01:20:18,871
that I couldn't control myself.

1988
01:20:19,301 --> 01:20:22,041
I regret not remaining calm.

1989
01:20:22,411 --> 01:20:23,511
What do we do?

1990
01:20:25,171 --> 01:20:26,381
(BUMSUP's scoreboard is full of the loser's chips.)

1991
01:20:26,911 --> 01:20:28,981
The next battle dancer...

1992
01:20:30,911 --> 01:20:32,781
is from Team Japan.

1993
01:20:34,251 --> 01:20:36,050
(Which would it be?)

1994
01:20:36,051 --> 01:20:37,921
OSAKA Ojo Gang's...

1995
01:20:40,361 --> 01:20:41,361
Kyoka.

1996
01:20:42,591 --> 01:20:43,591
Kyoka.

1997
01:20:44,091 --> 01:20:45,601
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's Kyoka)

1998
01:20:45,731 --> 01:20:46,731
Kyoka.

1999
01:20:46,732 --> 01:20:47,931
(She's suddenly polite.)

2000
01:20:48,101 --> 01:20:50,070
I'm waiting for this.

2001
01:20:50,071 --> 01:20:51,270
Let's go.

2002
01:20:51,271 --> 01:20:52,271
It has come.

2003
01:20:52,272 --> 01:20:53,770
She's a really strong battle dancer.

2004
01:20:53,771 --> 01:20:56,210
You like hip-hop, but you don't know Kyoka?

2005
01:20:56,211 --> 01:20:57,711
Are you sure you like hip-hop?

2006
01:20:58,011 --> 01:20:59,441
It's like OG.

2007
01:20:59,781 --> 01:21:02,250
As a woman in street dance, I have mad respect for her.

2008
01:21:02,251 --> 01:21:03,251
- Yes.
- She's...

2009
01:21:03,252 --> 01:21:05,080
Kyoka is...

2010
01:21:05,081 --> 01:21:06,421
I hear she's a gangster, right?

2011
01:21:07,281 --> 01:21:08,521
Yes. My time.

2012
01:21:09,051 --> 01:21:10,051
Okay.

2013
01:21:10,651 --> 01:21:13,361
The dancer I can beat...

2014
01:21:14,891 --> 01:21:16,761
I'm curious.

2015
01:21:17,131 --> 01:21:18,430
(They're...)

2016
01:21:18,431 --> 01:21:20,161
(extremely nervous.)

2017
01:21:20,361 --> 01:21:22,231
is from Japan as well.

2018
01:21:23,001 --> 01:21:24,001
(Us?)

2019
01:21:24,002 --> 01:21:25,230
(She's shocked.)

2020
01:21:25,231 --> 01:21:26,240
(This is interesting.)

2021
01:21:26,241 --> 01:21:28,001
RHTokyo's...

2022
01:21:31,911 --> 01:21:32,881
Rie Hata.

2023
01:21:33,741 --> 01:21:34,841
(RHTokyo's Rie Hata)

2024
01:21:35,981 --> 01:21:37,451
(They all cheer.)

2025
01:21:38,111 --> 01:21:39,620
(Really?)

2026
01:21:39,621 --> 01:21:40,621
(Make some noise.)

2027
01:21:40,622 --> 01:21:42,150
What's going to happen?

2028
01:21:42,151 --> 01:21:43,690
I want to watch this.

2029
01:21:43,691 --> 01:21:45,460
Goodness!

2030
01:21:45,461 --> 01:21:48,191
This battle is legendary.

2031
01:21:48,491 --> 01:21:50,390
My queen right there.

2032
01:21:50,391 --> 01:21:51,890
That's our swag queen.

2033
01:21:51,891 --> 01:21:53,760
Rie gave me one of the most lucrative...

2034
01:21:53,761 --> 01:21:55,630
choreographies ever for Stray Kids.

2035
01:21:55,631 --> 01:21:56,900
She was your choreographer?

2036
01:21:56,901 --> 01:21:58,400
I've heard a lot of things about her.

2037
01:21:58,401 --> 01:22:00,200
It's exciting to see those two...

2038
01:22:00,201 --> 01:22:01,571
- in real life.
- It's so fun.

2039
01:22:01,641 --> 01:22:04,770
Goodness. I can't wait.

2040
01:22:04,771 --> 01:22:07,210
I can't wait.

2041
01:22:07,211 --> 01:22:08,380
I'm so excited.

2042
01:22:08,381 --> 01:22:10,111
Let's go!

2043
01:22:10,951 --> 01:22:12,250
Let's go!

2044
01:22:12,251 --> 01:22:13,350
Let's go!

2045
01:22:13,351 --> 01:22:15,220
Rie!

2046
01:22:15,221 --> 01:22:17,290
Will it be Osaka or Tokyo?

2047
01:22:17,291 --> 01:22:19,290
Japan versus Japan.

2048
01:22:19,291 --> 01:22:21,090
Who is going to take it?

2049
01:22:21,091 --> 01:22:22,961
I don't know.

2050
01:22:23,291 --> 01:22:26,300
That's a challenge between these two Japan scenes.

2051
01:22:26,301 --> 01:22:27,730
Osaka and Tokyo.

2052
01:22:27,731 --> 01:22:30,230
At the end of the day, there's only one way to find out.

2053
01:22:30,231 --> 01:22:31,430
They have to battle it out.

2054
01:22:31,431 --> 01:22:32,441
They have to fight.

2055
01:22:33,001 --> 01:22:35,810
Tokyo versus Osaka. You don't see this every day.

2056
01:22:35,811 --> 01:22:38,110
Oksaka's dance is a bit more old school.

2057
01:22:38,111 --> 01:22:40,240
Tokyo's dance is like new school.

2058
01:22:40,241 --> 01:22:41,380
Commercial.

2059
01:22:41,381 --> 01:22:44,250
Oksaka's dance scene does lots of old-school hip-hop,

2060
01:22:44,251 --> 01:22:47,520
waaking, rocking, popping, and punk battles...

2061
01:22:47,521 --> 01:22:49,890
or events.

2062
01:22:49,891 --> 01:22:51,990
The battle platform is best...

2063
01:22:51,991 --> 01:22:53,990
to see who's better and verify their skills.

2064
01:22:53,991 --> 01:22:56,731
They're sticking just to the original.

2065
01:22:57,461 --> 01:23:01,630
Kyoka was a really famous kids battle dancer in Oksaka.

2066
01:23:01,631 --> 01:23:03,930
She's a dancer who has danced for many years...

2067
01:23:03,931 --> 01:23:05,900
while sticking to the original hip-hop dance line.

2068
01:23:05,901 --> 01:23:09,540
She's the top hip-hop dancer in the battle scene.

2069
01:23:09,541 --> 01:23:12,240
She won first place in "Juste Debout,"

2070
01:23:12,241 --> 01:23:13,440
an event with the best authority in the world.

2071
01:23:13,441 --> 01:23:15,280
She started off with fame.

2072
01:23:15,281 --> 01:23:17,180
"I'll go my way. I'll protect the underground hip-hop scene."

2073
01:23:17,181 --> 01:23:19,750
She's a dancer with a solid belief.

2074
01:23:19,751 --> 01:23:23,050
Kyoka is always named among Japan's representative dancers.

2075
01:23:23,051 --> 01:23:25,820
She's always respected in the battle scene.

2076
01:23:25,821 --> 01:23:27,291
Top-tier battle dancer.

2077
01:23:27,691 --> 01:23:31,161
When it comes to battle, I'm not afraid at all.

2078
01:23:31,331 --> 01:23:33,130
RHTokyo is a weak crew.

2079
01:23:33,131 --> 01:23:35,331
I want to beat them all in battle.

2080
01:23:36,171 --> 01:23:37,830
And then I feel like Tokyo...

2081
01:23:37,831 --> 01:23:40,670
The stylistic flips of dance.

2082
01:23:40,671 --> 01:23:43,510
They pioneer the new styles that trend these days.

2083
01:23:43,511 --> 01:23:45,411
They surely have a trendy choreography.

2084
01:23:45,811 --> 01:23:47,180
They do lots of backup dancing for singers...

2085
01:23:47,181 --> 01:23:49,710
or make choreographies.

2086
01:23:49,711 --> 01:23:51,881
They specialize in the media field.

2087
01:23:52,521 --> 01:23:55,380
Also, Rie Hata is like a revolution in Japan.

2088
01:23:55,381 --> 01:23:57,390
Whenever Rie Hata uploads a video,

2089
01:23:57,391 --> 01:23:59,260
that creates a syndrome.

2090
01:23:59,261 --> 01:24:01,890
She's the start of Japan becoming strong in dances...

2091
01:24:01,891 --> 01:24:05,631
in the choreography scene.

2092
01:24:06,061 --> 01:24:07,530
She's the queen of Japan.

2093
01:24:07,531 --> 01:24:09,570
Definitely international.

2094
01:24:09,571 --> 01:24:10,571
Chris Brown.

2095
01:24:10,572 --> 01:24:12,870
Rie Hata has been with Chris Brown,

2096
01:24:12,871 --> 01:24:17,011
and she's done so many iconic videos and choreography.

2097
01:24:17,471 --> 01:24:20,010
I always watched her on social media, and I just loved...

2098
01:24:20,011 --> 01:24:22,750
her swag and how she dresses.

2099
01:24:22,751 --> 01:24:25,280
She's well-known and also looked up to.

2100
01:24:25,281 --> 01:24:26,750
I could say she's the national dancer...

2101
01:24:26,751 --> 01:24:28,221
when it comes to choreography.

2102
01:24:29,991 --> 01:24:33,160
Tokyo and Osaka have different values in dancing,

2103
01:24:33,161 --> 01:24:34,490
so they could collide.

2104
01:24:34,491 --> 01:24:36,160
When it comes to battle, it's Osaka.

2105
01:24:36,161 --> 01:24:37,790
When it comes to choreography, it's Tokyo.

2106
01:24:37,791 --> 01:24:40,100
I don't want to be a backup dancer for artists.

2107
01:24:40,101 --> 01:24:42,900
Why do I have to do the dance...

2108
01:24:42,901 --> 01:24:45,540
I've been putting my life into behind someone?

2109
01:24:45,541 --> 01:24:47,970
The dance scene isn't all about street dancing.

2110
01:24:47,971 --> 01:24:51,370
There are dancers who work in the commercial field.

2111
01:24:51,371 --> 01:24:53,380
There are many fields.

2112
01:24:53,381 --> 01:24:55,180
People are working hard in each field.

2113
01:24:55,181 --> 01:24:58,110
I think Tokyo has many people who want to be famous,

2114
01:24:58,111 --> 01:25:01,221
want to get a job, or want to shine.

2115
01:25:01,481 --> 01:25:03,520
Osaka isn't related to the trend.

2116
01:25:03,521 --> 01:25:05,920
Osaka digs deeper into the dance.

2117
01:25:05,921 --> 01:25:08,621
You can focus on one genre.

2118
01:25:09,031 --> 01:25:10,330
So if you want to be a real dancer,

2119
01:25:10,331 --> 01:25:11,831
you should come to Osaka.

2120
01:25:14,001 --> 01:25:16,430
I think Rie Hata will be weaker in battle.

2121
01:25:16,431 --> 01:25:18,701
She mostly focuses on the choreography.

2122
01:25:19,541 --> 01:25:23,111
I'm sorry, but I can totally beat her in battle.

2123
01:25:23,441 --> 01:25:25,841
Of course, I respect her.

2124
01:25:25,981 --> 01:25:28,710
But she doesn't come to this scene.

2125
01:25:28,711 --> 01:25:30,180
She doesn't come to fight.

2126
01:25:30,181 --> 01:25:31,580
If you're a dancer,

2127
01:25:31,581 --> 01:25:34,650
you should come to the scene of dancers...

2128
01:25:34,651 --> 01:25:36,690
and get recognized by dancers.

2129
01:25:36,691 --> 01:25:37,850
That's a real dancer.

2130
01:25:37,851 --> 01:25:40,391
You uploaded a choreography on social media and it became a hit.

2131
01:25:40,921 --> 01:25:42,660
You can say she's a superstar...

2132
01:25:42,661 --> 01:25:44,830
or a real dancer.

2133
01:25:44,831 --> 01:25:49,001
She only made one choreography.

2134
01:25:49,231 --> 01:25:50,871
That's not true.

2135
01:25:52,171 --> 01:25:54,200
She's made about 100 of them.

2136
01:25:54,201 --> 01:25:56,241
Is she capable of doing that?

2137
01:25:56,641 --> 01:25:59,780
I work as a choreographer.

2138
01:25:59,781 --> 01:26:03,250
It's clear that Rie Hata has her style.

2139
01:26:03,251 --> 01:26:07,080
I just dance to dig deeper...

2140
01:26:07,081 --> 01:26:08,420
into something I think is cool.

2141
01:26:08,421 --> 01:26:10,250
I don't think I'd lose,

2142
01:26:10,251 --> 01:26:11,650
and I don't plan on losing.

2143
01:26:11,651 --> 01:26:13,190
I want to prove...

2144
01:26:13,191 --> 01:26:15,661
the things I've been doing.

2145
01:26:16,131 --> 01:26:17,730
The battle dancer of Osaka.

2146
01:26:17,731 --> 01:26:20,360
Team Japan, OSAKA Ojo Gang's Kyoka.

2147
01:26:20,361 --> 01:26:21,500
Do whatever you want.

2148
01:26:21,501 --> 01:26:23,530
I think Kyoka will win 100 percent.

2149
01:26:23,531 --> 01:26:25,000
Kyoka would do well.

2150
01:26:25,001 --> 01:26:26,400
I'm so excited to watch Kyoka.

2151
01:26:26,401 --> 01:26:27,500
She's like one of my favorite dancers...

2152
01:26:27,501 --> 01:26:28,571
- of all time.
- I know.

2153
01:26:28,771 --> 01:26:30,510
Tokyo's choreographer.

2154
01:26:30,511 --> 01:26:32,980
Team Japan, RHTokyo's Rie Hata.

2155
01:26:32,981 --> 01:26:36,110
She called me out because she thought she was way better.

2156
01:26:36,111 --> 01:26:37,880
But you never know until you try.

2157
01:26:37,881 --> 01:26:39,780
Let's decide on it with this.

2158
01:26:39,781 --> 01:26:42,620
I'm sure Rie will show us something.

2159
01:26:42,621 --> 01:26:43,850
I've never seen Rie Hata's freestyle dance.

2160
01:26:43,851 --> 01:26:44,950
Me neither.

2161
01:26:44,951 --> 01:26:46,890
A battle between Rie Hata and Kyoka.

2162
01:26:46,891 --> 01:26:49,760
I think Kyoka will win by a landslide.

2163
01:26:49,761 --> 01:26:51,960
It's clear that Rie is not a battle dancer...

2164
01:26:51,961 --> 01:26:54,100
and it was clear that Kyoko was.

2165
01:26:54,101 --> 01:26:55,431
I shouldn't put my guard down.

2166
01:26:56,431 --> 01:26:58,370
Team Japan versus Team Japan.

2167
01:26:58,371 --> 01:27:00,640
We don't need two crews to represent Japan.

2168
01:27:00,641 --> 01:27:02,241
I can't lose this.

2169
01:27:02,441 --> 01:27:03,670
Kyoka!

2170
01:27:03,671 --> 01:27:05,170
Rie Hata!

2171
01:27:05,171 --> 01:27:07,340
The battle between the two dancers will begin.

2172
01:27:07,341 --> 01:27:09,080
Ready, fight!

2173
01:27:09,081 --> 01:27:10,680
Let's go!

2174
01:27:10,681 --> 01:27:12,050
Let's go!

2175
01:27:12,051 --> 01:27:14,580
(Show us, Kyoka.)

2176
01:27:14,581 --> 01:27:16,321
Awesome!

2177
01:27:19,491 --> 01:27:21,461
This is hip-hop, Rie.

2178
01:27:22,461 --> 01:27:23,731
It would be fun.

2179
01:27:30,331 --> 01:27:31,331
(She's thrilled.)

2180
01:27:32,671 --> 01:27:33,671
Goodness.

2181
01:27:39,281 --> 01:27:40,940
This is freestyling!

2182
01:27:40,941 --> 01:27:42,751
That was fire. Goodness.

2183
01:27:51,721 --> 01:27:52,991
That's Kyoka.

2184
01:27:54,321 --> 01:27:55,321
(They're shocked.)

2185
01:27:55,691 --> 01:27:57,461
She's good!

2186
01:27:59,431 --> 01:28:00,761
That's how it is?

2187
01:28:00,831 --> 01:28:02,361
I'll dance my best.

2188
01:28:02,771 --> 01:28:04,771
It doesn't make me nervous.

2189
01:28:13,511 --> 01:28:14,780
(That's awesome.)

2190
01:28:14,781 --> 01:28:16,210
She's nice.

2191
01:28:16,211 --> 01:28:18,711
- She's a gang.
- She's really nice.

2192
01:28:23,651 --> 01:28:24,651
She's experienced.

2193
01:28:24,652 --> 01:28:26,461
She's really good at the leg roll.

2194
01:28:26,591 --> 01:28:27,821
(She's thrilled.)

2195
01:28:33,501 --> 01:28:34,700
Countdown.

2196
01:28:34,701 --> 01:28:35,871
Go, Rie.

2197
01:28:36,171 --> 01:28:37,300
Nice.

2198
01:28:37,301 --> 01:28:39,100
Two, one.

2199
01:28:39,101 --> 01:28:41,341
You nailed the stage.

2200
01:28:41,601 --> 01:28:44,210
Switch. RHTokyo's Rie Hata.

2201
01:28:44,211 --> 01:28:45,510
Rie!

2202
01:28:45,511 --> 01:28:46,511
Go!

2203
01:28:47,311 --> 01:28:49,111
She was no threat at all.

2204
01:28:49,481 --> 01:28:51,051
This is how the music is.

2205
01:28:51,381 --> 01:28:52,751
Look at me, Kyoka.

2206
01:28:55,521 --> 01:28:56,521
(He's shocked.)

2207
01:28:57,291 --> 01:28:58,291
That's nice.

2208
01:28:58,521 --> 01:28:59,521
Yes!

2209
01:29:04,661 --> 01:29:05,661
Okay!

2210
01:29:05,801 --> 01:29:06,801
She's good.

2211
01:29:06,901 --> 01:29:07,901
That's cool.

2212
01:29:08,131 --> 01:29:09,971
She doesn't know how to battle.

2213
01:29:17,641 --> 01:29:18,641
(This is it.)

2214
01:29:20,781 --> 01:29:22,851
Honestly, nothing hit me.

2215
01:29:23,211 --> 01:29:24,511
It was a performance.

2216
01:29:25,921 --> 01:29:26,921
I was feeling confident.

2217
01:29:27,651 --> 01:29:29,451
I decided to enjoy the battle.

2218
01:29:30,951 --> 01:29:31,951
(Absorbed)

2219
01:29:39,331 --> 01:29:40,360
(What's that?)

2220
01:29:40,361 --> 01:29:41,361
(Cheering)

2221
01:29:43,531 --> 01:29:44,531
(Great teamwork)

2222
01:29:44,731 --> 01:29:46,101
- Unbelievable.
- Goodness.

2223
01:29:49,571 --> 01:29:51,771
That's not a street dance battle.

2224
01:29:53,511 --> 01:29:55,180
When it comes to the dance being creative or not,

2225
01:29:55,181 --> 01:29:56,510
I was more creative.

2226
01:29:56,511 --> 01:30:00,881
Five, four, three, two, one.

2227
01:30:00,981 --> 01:30:02,990
Battle over.

2228
01:30:02,991 --> 01:30:05,921
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

2229
01:30:07,661 --> 01:30:08,961
That was terrific!

2230
01:30:09,791 --> 01:30:11,760
- She's good.
- She's better than I expected.

2231
01:30:11,761 --> 01:30:13,701
- She's good.
- This is fun!

2232
01:30:14,861 --> 01:30:15,901
Nice.

2233
01:30:17,331 --> 01:30:19,241
That was a hit.

2234
01:30:19,901 --> 01:30:20,940
So different.

2235
01:30:20,941 --> 01:30:21,970
They're different,

2236
01:30:21,971 --> 01:30:22,971
- but I'll pick Kyoka.
- Me too.

2237
01:30:23,141 --> 01:30:25,440
After Kyoka made a kick, it was so fun.

2238
01:30:25,441 --> 01:30:26,580
She was dope.

2239
01:30:26,581 --> 01:30:27,880
Strengthwise, yes.

2240
01:30:27,881 --> 01:30:29,041
Fluidity.

2241
01:30:29,581 --> 01:30:30,581
Who do you think will win?

2242
01:30:30,582 --> 01:30:31,780
I think Rie Hata.

2243
01:30:31,781 --> 01:30:33,221
I think Rie Hata will win.

2244
01:30:33,451 --> 01:30:34,881
She thrilled people.

2245
01:30:34,951 --> 01:30:36,950
And I like her. Suits that name here.

2246
01:30:36,951 --> 01:30:39,191
So smooth and sharp.

2247
01:30:39,621 --> 01:30:42,390
Once again, Japan versus Japan.

2248
01:30:42,391 --> 01:30:44,090
It's like a direct rivalry.

2249
01:30:44,091 --> 01:30:46,060
Respect Kyoka for choosing...

2250
01:30:46,061 --> 01:30:48,230
someone that you know and respect.

2251
01:30:48,231 --> 01:30:50,230
That is a hard decision.

2252
01:30:50,231 --> 01:30:52,370
This is another one of those battles, well...

2253
01:30:52,371 --> 01:30:54,270
Everybody watching at home would say,

2254
01:30:54,271 --> 01:30:57,610
"This would never happen anywhere!"

2255
01:30:57,611 --> 01:31:00,280
This is a gem for dance history.

2256
01:31:00,281 --> 01:31:02,811
This is so cool that this actually happened.

2257
01:31:03,011 --> 01:31:04,451
Yes.

2258
01:31:04,511 --> 01:31:05,711
- I know.
- First of all,

2259
01:31:05,951 --> 01:31:08,520
Kyoka, your energy was so amazing.

2260
01:31:08,521 --> 01:31:10,421
You went out for blood.

2261
01:31:10,791 --> 01:31:12,860
You were a free soul out there.

2262
01:31:12,861 --> 01:31:16,691
Your energy and power are just big enough to fill this whole room.

2263
01:31:16,891 --> 01:31:19,701
All the moves are spontaneous and impromptu,

2264
01:31:19,801 --> 01:31:22,461
while being perfect in techniques.

2265
01:31:22,971 --> 01:31:25,400
I feel like you came in super raw,

2266
01:31:25,401 --> 01:31:27,940
I feel like your strength really shined.

2267
01:31:27,941 --> 01:31:31,310
Energy, your vibe, swag, you carry into the battles.

2268
01:31:31,311 --> 01:31:34,140
The flow is just non-stop rawness.

2269
01:31:34,141 --> 01:31:35,511
So it's my respect.

2270
01:31:36,111 --> 01:31:37,211
Rie Hata,

2271
01:31:38,481 --> 01:31:40,420
star.

2272
01:31:40,421 --> 01:31:42,721
It's just as simple as that. It's star quality.

2273
01:31:43,091 --> 01:31:45,621
Rie had more moments for us to connect to.

2274
01:31:45,751 --> 01:31:49,361
More moments to see the story, to experience the experience with her.

2275
01:31:49,431 --> 01:31:50,531
My goodness.

2276
01:31:51,361 --> 01:31:52,860
Even the moment when she went to her crew...

2277
01:31:52,861 --> 01:31:55,031
and they did the whole thing together like that.

2278
01:31:55,101 --> 01:31:58,470
Little moments like that really, I think, make,

2279
01:31:58,471 --> 01:32:00,471
a battle, a freestyle battle.

2280
01:32:01,701 --> 01:32:04,471
Now, we'll check the result of the two dancers' battle.

2281
01:32:05,271 --> 01:32:06,281
Which one would it be?

2282
01:32:06,441 --> 01:32:08,580
I'm sweating so much.

2283
01:32:08,581 --> 01:32:12,080
She showed a freestyle that I imagined,

2284
01:32:12,081 --> 01:32:14,380
so honestly, I thought I won for sure.

2285
01:32:14,381 --> 01:32:17,451
Regarding livening up the mood, I think I won.

2286
01:32:18,221 --> 01:32:21,161
Fight judges, card open.

2287
01:32:22,831 --> 01:32:24,231
(Aliya Janell chose RHTokyo.)

2288
01:32:25,861 --> 01:32:26,901
(Surprised)

2289
01:32:27,761 --> 01:32:29,001
That's three votes.

2290
01:32:29,061 --> 01:32:30,600
It's 3 versus 0.

2291
01:32:30,601 --> 01:32:34,441
In Team Japan, Rie Hata of RHTokyo won.

2292
01:32:37,011 --> 01:32:38,371
Thank you.

2293
01:32:38,441 --> 01:32:40,040
No, I'm not good enough.

2294
01:32:40,041 --> 01:32:41,510
I will practice more.

2295
01:32:41,511 --> 01:32:43,051
- But you won.
- Thanks.

2296
01:32:44,011 --> 01:32:45,651
This doesn't make sense. Ojo Gang lost.

2297
01:32:45,851 --> 01:32:47,981
I thought it was obvious that Kyoka won.

2298
01:32:48,421 --> 01:32:52,320
As far as the battle goes, I feel like I had a bias going into this.

2299
01:32:52,321 --> 01:32:54,690
Obviously Kyoka, like mad respect,

2300
01:32:54,691 --> 01:32:56,560
and I had a feeling like you were going to take this...

2301
01:32:56,561 --> 01:32:58,361
because it's a freestyle battle.

2302
01:32:58,691 --> 01:33:01,660
But I did feel like in this one round...

2303
01:33:01,661 --> 01:33:05,071
without any bias of anything outside this battle,

2304
01:33:05,431 --> 01:33:08,601
it was Rie's moment. She wanted it so hard.

2305
01:33:09,811 --> 01:33:10,811
Thanks.

2306
01:33:11,071 --> 01:33:12,511
You're the best.

2307
01:33:12,741 --> 01:33:15,810
For 40 seconds, my presence of confidence...

2308
01:33:15,811 --> 01:33:18,980
toward dance were expressed, I think.

2309
01:33:18,981 --> 01:33:21,851
I'm happy that they saw it.

2310
01:33:21,981 --> 01:33:24,820
Kyoka has lived in the battle scene,

2311
01:33:24,821 --> 01:33:28,320
and Rie has danced in the wider world, other than battles.

2312
01:33:28,321 --> 01:33:29,961
I think that made a difference.

2313
01:33:30,531 --> 01:33:31,591
Thank you for your work.

2314
01:33:32,161 --> 01:33:33,631
I guess Ojo Gang feels irritated.

2315
01:33:34,131 --> 01:33:35,230
I can't believe this.

2316
01:33:35,231 --> 01:33:36,701
I really want to kill everyone.

2317
01:33:37,471 --> 01:33:39,900
I think I lost because of the performance,

2318
01:33:39,901 --> 01:33:41,440
There were no other reasons I had to lose.

2319
01:33:41,441 --> 01:33:43,840
Dance skills, techniques, basics,

2320
01:33:43,841 --> 01:33:45,610
when I consider all of these,

2321
01:33:45,611 --> 01:33:47,181
I had no factor to lose.

2322
01:33:47,511 --> 01:33:50,251
Of course, I couldn't understand.

2323
01:33:50,411 --> 01:33:51,451
The result doesn't make sense at all.

2324
01:33:51,811 --> 01:33:54,581
Osaka versus Tokyo, which one is better?

2325
01:33:54,751 --> 01:33:56,421
To win, I'll do anything.

2326
01:33:57,151 --> 01:33:59,151
The next battlers are...

2327
01:33:59,521 --> 01:34:00,691
I feel nervous.

2328
01:34:01,991 --> 01:34:04,960
Of Team New Zealand, ROYAL FAMILY crew,

2329
01:34:04,961 --> 01:34:06,160
Teesha.

2330
01:34:06,161 --> 01:34:08,431
(Leader of ROYAL FAMILY, Teesha)

2331
01:34:08,701 --> 01:34:10,031
(At last,)

2332
01:34:10,471 --> 01:34:12,701
(ROYAL FAMILY battles.)

2333
01:34:13,101 --> 01:34:14,700
(The fight zone is heated up as a named crew enters to fight.)

2334
01:34:14,701 --> 01:34:16,241
Let's go, Teesha. Let's go.

2335
01:34:16,541 --> 01:34:20,010
It's the crew expected to be eliminated first.

2336
01:34:20,011 --> 01:34:21,210
Not in the battles.

2337
01:34:21,211 --> 01:34:22,740
The members are young.

2338
01:34:22,741 --> 01:34:25,811
To be honest, I have no expectation for their battles.

2339
01:34:25,981 --> 01:34:28,820
It received the most No Respect.

2340
01:34:28,821 --> 01:34:30,720
(ROYAL FAMILY is branded as the weakest crew.)

2341
01:34:30,721 --> 01:34:33,921
It was making me more motivated, and...

2342
01:34:34,161 --> 01:34:37,431
eager to get on that stage to battle with the crews.

2343
01:34:38,331 --> 01:34:39,601
(Tense)

2344
01:34:42,001 --> 01:34:44,531
Hi.

2345
01:34:46,841 --> 01:34:48,201
Teesha is so strong,

2346
01:34:48,301 --> 01:34:51,340
seeing her as a new generation of ROYAL FAMILY,

2347
01:34:51,341 --> 01:34:54,311
also being Parris' right-hand woman the latest.

2348
01:34:55,081 --> 01:34:56,750
Teesha of ROYAL FAMILY,

2349
01:34:56,751 --> 01:34:59,581
choose a dancer you think you can win.

2350
01:35:00,081 --> 01:35:03,650
The dancer I choose to compete against.

2351
01:35:03,651 --> 01:35:04,690
(Who...)

2352
01:35:04,691 --> 01:35:07,261
(will be chosen?)

2353
01:35:07,421 --> 01:35:08,661
Team Australia.

2354
01:35:11,131 --> 01:35:12,631
Team Australia?

2355
01:35:13,601 --> 01:35:14,630
Okay.

2356
01:35:14,631 --> 01:35:17,530
They're the old generation ROYAL FAMILY, you know what I'm saying?

2357
01:35:17,531 --> 01:35:18,631
It's the battle between the old and the new.

2358
01:35:19,271 --> 01:35:23,071
The current ROYAL FAMILY against the former ROYAL FAMILY.

2359
01:35:23,441 --> 01:35:26,211
- They're like juniors and seniors.
- Exactly.

2360
01:35:26,611 --> 01:35:27,911
Team Australia,

2361
01:35:29,481 --> 01:35:30,510
Kaea.

2362
01:35:30,511 --> 01:35:32,411
(Leader of AG AQUAD, Kaea)

2363
01:35:34,251 --> 01:35:35,280
Kaea.

2364
01:35:35,281 --> 01:35:36,521
(She must be crazy.)

2365
01:35:36,851 --> 01:35:39,090
(It's unbelievable.)

2366
01:35:39,091 --> 01:35:40,321
It's leader versus leader.

2367
01:35:40,721 --> 01:35:42,160
I was expecting it...

2368
01:35:42,161 --> 01:35:45,230
because I'm an original member of ROYAL FAMILY.

2369
01:35:45,231 --> 01:35:47,600
Teesha being the leader of ROYAL FAMILY,

2370
01:35:47,601 --> 01:35:50,371
I'd had it in my mind that it was going to happen.

2371
01:35:52,771 --> 01:35:55,600
AG SQUAD has the key members, and ROYAL FAMILY has new ones.

2372
01:35:55,601 --> 01:35:57,611
They're seniors and juniors.

2373
01:35:59,111 --> 01:36:01,880
The original members of ROYAL FAMILY are in AG SQUAD.

2374
01:36:01,881 --> 01:36:05,510
There are key members that adorned the legacy,

2375
01:36:05,511 --> 01:36:08,081
Kaea, Kyra, and Ruthy Baby.

2376
01:36:08,251 --> 01:36:09,451
They were right-handed women of Parris.

2377
01:36:09,991 --> 01:36:11,391
They stood next to her, no matter what.

2378
01:36:11,491 --> 01:36:13,120
And when Parris wasn't on the stage,

2379
01:36:13,121 --> 01:36:15,090
they were at the center many times.

2380
01:36:15,091 --> 01:36:17,760
Since they were the main dancers,

2381
01:36:17,761 --> 01:36:20,331
they're like celebrities for other dancers.

2382
01:36:21,101 --> 01:36:24,530
Me and her had a history together with the ROYAL FAMILY dance crew.

2383
01:36:24,531 --> 01:36:28,001
We were the members in the 1st 6 years of it, making it.

2384
01:36:28,801 --> 01:36:30,510
(Recording 27.92 million views)

2385
01:36:30,511 --> 01:36:32,670
(Recording 170 million views)

2386
01:36:32,671 --> 01:36:34,881
(Recording 250 million views)

2387
01:36:35,581 --> 01:36:37,710
(The original key members who made up the crew's current fame)

2388
01:36:37,711 --> 01:36:40,081
The new generation of ROYAL FAMILY...

2389
01:36:40,181 --> 01:36:43,521
must have had a smooth journey on the path the old generation made.

2390
01:36:43,751 --> 01:36:47,191
I have more expectations for AG SQUAD.

2391
01:36:47,291 --> 01:36:51,160
Everyone's going to be expecting what the older generation does,

2392
01:36:51,161 --> 01:36:53,160
- but in this new generation.
- Yes.

2393
01:36:53,161 --> 01:36:57,271
They have paved the way for us to be the dancers that we are today.

2394
01:36:57,371 --> 01:36:59,470
But I think for the new generation,

2395
01:36:59,471 --> 01:37:01,970
it is our time to break that limit from...

2396
01:37:01,971 --> 01:37:06,441
the world comparing the new generation to the old generation.

2397
01:37:06,681 --> 01:37:08,581
(Videos and comments compare them to the old generation.)

2398
01:37:09,281 --> 01:37:11,310
(The number of views in the official accounts show a huge difference.)

2399
01:37:11,311 --> 01:37:13,820
Being not at the same level, but...

2400
01:37:13,821 --> 01:37:16,420
At the same level. We're at the same level.

2401
01:37:16,421 --> 01:37:17,690
We're at the same level.

2402
01:37:17,691 --> 01:37:20,060
The choreography we do is harder.

2403
01:37:20,061 --> 01:37:22,761
Yes, definitely. Way more complex.

2404
01:37:22,821 --> 01:37:25,060
- The choreography has evolved.
- Yes.

2405
01:37:25,061 --> 01:37:28,231
And our strength evolves in the choreography present right now.

2406
01:37:28,331 --> 01:37:31,030
I have been in ROYAL FAMILY longer than her.

2407
01:37:31,031 --> 01:37:33,671
And I'll just go full outs.

2408
01:37:35,301 --> 01:37:38,140
I definitely have a strong drive to win.

2409
01:37:38,141 --> 01:37:41,740
We're capable of battling every single dancer...

2410
01:37:41,741 --> 01:37:43,311
that's willing to challenge us.

2411
01:37:43,581 --> 01:37:46,211
If they pick me, I'll be dying for battles.

2412
01:37:47,021 --> 01:37:49,281
Ex-ROYAL FAMILY to ROYAL FAMILY,

2413
01:37:49,351 --> 01:37:51,251
a very intense battle.

2414
01:37:51,651 --> 01:37:54,661
If Teesha and I are in this, that will be definitely the biggest.

2415
01:37:54,861 --> 01:37:58,361
Killing it on that stage because they're our rivals.

2416
01:37:58,691 --> 01:38:02,430
She is such an amazing dancer, and she has so much experience as well.

2417
01:38:02,431 --> 01:38:03,931
We're the originals, you know.

2418
01:38:03,971 --> 01:38:05,171
Come on, red hair.

2419
01:38:05,331 --> 01:38:06,700
Let's go. I'm ready.

2420
01:38:06,701 --> 01:38:09,040
I'm the leader of ROYAL FAMILY.

2421
01:38:09,041 --> 01:38:11,670
I'm the original member of ROYAL FAMILY.

2422
01:38:11,671 --> 01:38:13,810
It's an amazing drama. It's unbelievable.

2423
01:38:13,811 --> 01:38:16,211
- It's going to be crazy.
- Battle of the Pacific.

2424
01:38:16,811 --> 01:38:19,380
Teesha of ROYAL FAMILY, Team New Zealand...

2425
01:38:19,381 --> 01:38:22,020
going against Kaea of AG SQUAD, Team Australia.

2426
01:38:22,021 --> 01:38:24,620
The battle of the two dancers begins!

2427
01:38:24,621 --> 01:38:26,021
- Let's go.
- Teesha!

2428
01:38:26,191 --> 01:38:28,091
- All right.
- Go, Kaea!

2429
01:38:28,321 --> 01:38:30,090
I know what she's going to bring,

2430
01:38:30,091 --> 01:38:32,130
so I know that I can win.

2431
01:38:32,131 --> 01:38:34,300
"They're easy to beat. We can beat them."

2432
01:38:34,301 --> 01:38:36,131
But we will eat.

2433
01:38:37,031 --> 01:38:38,531
Ready? Fight!

2434
01:38:38,831 --> 01:38:40,101
Let's go.

2435
01:38:40,341 --> 01:38:42,401
(Teesha, leader of ROYAL FAMILY, goes first.)

2436
01:38:42,641 --> 01:38:44,011
(Let's go!)

2437
01:38:44,271 --> 01:38:45,411
- All right.
- Let's go!

2438
01:38:46,211 --> 01:38:47,441
It's time for me.

2439
01:38:49,811 --> 01:38:51,681
(Watch me.)

2440
01:38:52,211 --> 01:38:53,521
I knew it was going to happen.

2441
01:38:53,651 --> 01:38:55,680
Show that the new generation is strong.

2442
01:38:55,681 --> 01:38:56,751
(I'll show the current ROYAL FAMILY is strong.)

2443
01:38:56,921 --> 01:38:57,921
Okay!

2444
01:39:01,391 --> 01:39:02,721
She's really powerful.

2445
01:39:06,191 --> 01:39:07,261
Just funny.

2446
01:39:08,761 --> 01:39:09,771
She's so good.

2447
01:39:13,301 --> 01:39:14,541
That's cute.

2448
01:39:16,441 --> 01:39:18,141
More powerful moves.

2449
01:39:21,141 --> 01:39:22,241
(She loves it.)

2450
01:39:24,981 --> 01:39:26,451
She's using her whole body.

2451
01:39:26,481 --> 01:39:27,521
I don't care.

2452
01:39:28,821 --> 01:39:30,591
It's amazing how she uses her body.

2453
01:39:31,891 --> 01:39:32,891
Let's go!

2454
01:39:33,821 --> 01:39:36,391
- It's not very good.
- That's our leader right there.

2455
01:39:37,131 --> 01:39:38,691
(Power up!)

2456
01:39:39,631 --> 01:39:41,031
She's so good.

2457
01:39:41,401 --> 01:39:43,171
Her stamina is big.

2458
01:39:47,871 --> 01:39:49,271
Hype!

2459
01:39:49,471 --> 01:39:52,510
Three, two, one, switch!

2460
01:39:52,511 --> 01:39:54,041
AG SQUAD. Kaea!

2461
01:39:55,441 --> 01:39:57,611
- GO, Kaea!
- Let's go!

2462
01:39:57,811 --> 01:39:59,981
I'm going to show my competitive side.

2463
01:40:00,621 --> 01:40:01,621
Let's go.

2464
01:40:04,921 --> 01:40:06,351
This is the energy.

2465
01:40:06,521 --> 01:40:07,621
(Awesome)

2466
01:40:07,721 --> 01:40:09,061
(Nice Start!)

2467
01:40:09,361 --> 01:40:10,631
(Keeping her in check)

2468
01:40:13,091 --> 01:40:14,701
That was high.

2469
01:40:15,561 --> 01:40:16,831
Okay. Go.

2470
01:40:17,671 --> 01:40:18,671
(Bring it on!)

2471
01:40:18,671 --> 01:40:19,671
I don't care.

2472
01:40:19,871 --> 01:40:20,871
(Fantastic)

2473
01:40:26,911 --> 01:40:28,641
- Come on!
- Let's go!

2474
01:40:28,941 --> 01:40:29,950
Kill it.

2475
01:40:29,951 --> 01:40:32,011
Let's go!

2476
01:40:33,851 --> 01:40:35,981
All right, guys. Losing is not an option.

2477
01:40:36,851 --> 01:40:39,121
I wasn't really so intimidated.

2478
01:40:42,891 --> 01:40:44,260
It's very provocative.

2479
01:40:44,261 --> 01:40:47,031
Hey!

2480
01:40:50,671 --> 01:40:51,731
She's doing great.

2481
01:40:52,301 --> 01:40:53,671
I don't really care.

2482
01:41:00,681 --> 01:41:02,781
Countdown. Five, four,

2483
01:41:03,211 --> 01:41:04,781
three, two, one.

2484
01:41:07,651 --> 01:41:09,950
three, two, one.

2485
01:41:09,951 --> 01:41:11,821
Battle over!

2486
01:41:11,991 --> 01:41:13,291
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

2487
01:41:14,121 --> 01:41:15,260
- You killed it.
- My head went blank.

2488
01:41:15,261 --> 01:41:17,431
- You did awesome.
- Nice job.

2489
01:41:17,531 --> 01:41:19,561
- That's really hard.
- Yes.

2490
01:41:19,761 --> 01:41:21,361
- I can't believe I'm watching this.
- I know.

2491
01:41:22,131 --> 01:41:23,701
I actually don't know how this is going to go.

2492
01:41:24,171 --> 01:41:25,531
How will it go?

2493
01:41:26,601 --> 01:41:29,471
First of all, I'm a big fan of both of you two.

2494
01:41:29,571 --> 01:41:31,870
So, I was really concentrating...

2495
01:41:31,871 --> 01:41:34,141
on seeing every moment you guys did.

2496
01:41:34,411 --> 01:41:36,211
So, I mean, it was neck and neck.

2497
01:41:36,311 --> 01:41:39,481
Because I feel like they both are very strong.

2498
01:41:39,711 --> 01:41:42,080
Kaea, you were a free soul out there.

2499
01:41:42,081 --> 01:41:44,621
All the movements were spontaneous and impromptu...

2500
01:41:44,891 --> 01:41:47,021
while being perfect in technique.

2501
01:41:47,121 --> 01:41:50,331
Teesha, your dance is so powerful.

2502
01:41:50,531 --> 01:41:52,490
You were very assertive with your moves.

2503
01:41:52,491 --> 01:41:53,661
That was the good part.

2504
01:41:54,461 --> 01:41:57,030
(Two leaders received great comments from the fight judges.)

2505
01:41:57,031 --> 01:41:58,300
I think ROYAL FAMILY was stronger.

2506
01:41:58,301 --> 01:41:59,901
She was in technique.

2507
01:42:00,041 --> 01:42:02,471
Kaea had composure and control.

2508
01:42:02,571 --> 01:42:03,941
How can they pick one of them?

2509
01:42:04,511 --> 01:42:06,641
We'll find out who the winner is.

2510
01:42:07,641 --> 01:42:09,981
(Nervous)

2511
01:42:11,381 --> 01:42:12,881
I can feel the nerves through.

2512
01:42:13,051 --> 01:42:14,681
I'm too nervous to stand.

2513
01:42:15,451 --> 01:42:17,951
I've been in the ROYAL FAMILY longer than her.

2514
01:42:18,121 --> 01:42:19,121
We'll win.

2515
01:42:19,891 --> 01:42:21,690
We need to prove...

2516
01:42:21,691 --> 01:42:25,391
that we're strong, like the OG ROYAL FAMILY dancers.

2517
01:42:25,631 --> 01:42:28,001
Fight judges, open the card.

2518
01:42:29,401 --> 01:42:31,801
(Aliya Janell chose ROYAL FAMILY.)

2519
01:42:32,701 --> 01:42:35,100
(Mike Song chose AG SQUAD.)

2520
01:42:35,101 --> 01:42:37,341
- That's crazy.
- They're tied.

2521
01:42:37,841 --> 01:42:39,741
Sure pink. Come on.

2522
01:42:39,981 --> 01:42:41,141
It's quite tense.

2523
01:42:42,111 --> 01:42:44,681
(Which crew will win?)

2524
01:42:51,051 --> 01:42:52,051
(Teesha, the leader of the ROYAL FAMILY, won.)

2525
01:42:52,052 --> 01:42:53,221
(Trying to be cool)

2526
01:42:53,861 --> 01:42:56,961
- That's it!
- That's it.

2527
01:42:57,331 --> 01:42:58,461
(We're so proud of you.)

2528
01:42:58,791 --> 01:42:59,831
I'm really happy.

2529
01:43:00,761 --> 01:43:02,600
(ROYAL FAMILY is enjoying their first win.)

2530
01:43:02,601 --> 01:43:05,471
I won the battle against Kaea.

2531
01:43:05,771 --> 01:43:08,840
Oh, my gosh. Putting the winner's chip on our board...

2532
01:43:08,841 --> 01:43:11,171
on our first win. It was amazing.

2533
01:43:11,271 --> 01:43:15,681
It would've given them confidence, like winning their own battles.

2534
01:43:16,411 --> 01:43:19,781
Now that the new generation is coming up, we can also be...

2535
01:43:19,881 --> 01:43:22,951
a role model for our people back home in New Zealand.

2536
01:43:24,251 --> 01:43:26,761
- That was good.
- That's fun.

2537
01:43:27,121 --> 01:43:29,121
I actually thought Kaea would win.

2538
01:43:29,621 --> 01:43:33,631
If Kaea were as powerful as she used to be,

2539
01:43:33,731 --> 01:43:34,801
no one would beat her.

2540
01:43:35,331 --> 01:43:36,801
The winner is the youngest generation.

2541
01:43:37,731 --> 01:43:38,731
It's mutiny.

2542
01:43:39,731 --> 01:43:40,741
No.

2543
01:43:41,871 --> 01:43:43,341
- It was so neck and neck.
- Yes.

2544
01:43:43,611 --> 01:43:44,811
I'm pissed.

2545
01:43:44,911 --> 01:43:46,271
Don't take it to heart.

2546
01:43:47,611 --> 01:43:48,941
That pisses me off.

2547
01:43:49,181 --> 01:43:51,811
I didn't get to showcase my skills enough.

2548
01:43:52,011 --> 01:43:55,621
I just feel disappointed and angry.

2549
01:43:56,181 --> 01:43:57,691
I just want to do it again.

2550
01:43:58,491 --> 01:43:59,921
- It was bad.
- No.

2551
01:44:00,461 --> 01:44:01,791
You were really shown.

2552
01:44:02,391 --> 01:44:04,591
It was controlled.

2553
01:44:05,761 --> 01:44:07,201
She got hurt in her pride.

2554
01:44:07,931 --> 01:44:09,160
They have to beat ROYAL FAMILY.

2555
01:44:09,161 --> 01:44:10,431
They must feel really pressured.

2556
01:44:11,701 --> 01:44:13,701
(Depressed, Happy)

2557
01:44:13,941 --> 01:44:16,341
My first one is done.

2558
01:44:16,941 --> 01:44:18,711
I feel pretty satisfied that Teesha won.

2559
01:44:19,441 --> 01:44:21,681
Team New Zealand ranked sixth.

2560
01:44:22,311 --> 01:44:24,511
I thought they were only good at choreography.

2561
01:44:24,611 --> 01:44:26,881
But they were also better at battle than I expected.

2562
01:44:27,281 --> 01:44:29,821
They're the ROYAL FAMILY for a reason.

2563
01:44:29,921 --> 01:44:31,920
You shouldn't jump to judgment.

2564
01:44:31,921 --> 01:44:35,361
I think ROYAL FAMILY is stronger.

2565
01:44:36,761 --> 01:44:39,360
The ROYAL FAMILY received countless No Respect stickers,

2566
01:44:39,361 --> 01:44:42,861
and it's even hard to tell who put them on.

2567
01:44:43,061 --> 01:44:45,300
But Teesha won the battle.

2568
01:44:45,301 --> 01:44:46,941
Teesha from ROYAL FAMILY won.

2569
01:44:47,201 --> 01:44:49,171
Moana from ROYAL FAMILY was also really good.

2570
01:44:49,371 --> 01:44:51,941
Moana won the battle.

2571
01:44:52,671 --> 01:44:55,181
I was surprised because it was unexpected.

2572
01:44:55,481 --> 01:44:57,511
Do not underestimate ROYAL FAMILY.

2573
01:44:57,651 --> 01:45:00,221
My girls deserve first place.

2574
01:45:00,851 --> 01:45:03,521
It's Harmz from ROYAL FAMILY.

2575
01:45:04,491 --> 01:45:06,151
Let's go.

2576
01:45:06,321 --> 01:45:08,421
- Go do it.
- Be careful.

2577
01:45:08,721 --> 01:45:11,191
- Look at the muscles on her arms.
- It's cool.

2578
01:45:11,591 --> 01:45:12,591
(Tightening her arms)

2579
01:45:12,631 --> 01:45:14,201
She has muscles.

2580
01:45:15,431 --> 01:45:16,901
She's athletic.

2581
01:45:17,471 --> 01:45:19,331
I'd get really hurt if I got hit during the battle.

2582
01:45:19,931 --> 01:45:22,041
(Harmz, the muscle family, could beat 500.)

2583
01:45:22,741 --> 01:45:26,370
I have the power to be able to move freely.

2584
01:45:26,371 --> 01:45:28,741
I did the first competition last year,

2585
01:45:29,081 --> 01:45:31,951
and I came seventh in New Zealand.

2586
01:45:32,051 --> 01:45:34,251
(Power)

2587
01:45:35,381 --> 01:45:36,581
(Powerful)

2588
01:45:37,421 --> 01:45:40,491
You can see how well I'm doing in battle.

2589
01:45:42,861 --> 01:45:43,861
(Stepping back)

2590
01:45:44,961 --> 01:45:46,131
Her arms look really strong.

2591
01:45:49,901 --> 01:45:54,571
The dance is so powerful, and you're very assertive with your moves.

2592
01:45:54,671 --> 01:45:56,501
Hey, guys.

2593
01:45:56,941 --> 01:45:58,640
It's about time I get on the dance floor.

2594
01:45:58,641 --> 01:45:59,710
I'm not going to lie.

2595
01:45:59,711 --> 01:46:01,081
- Her face is small.
- Yes.

2596
01:46:01,341 --> 01:46:02,741
She's pretty.

2597
01:46:04,681 --> 01:46:06,050
- She's pretty.
- She is.

2598
01:46:06,051 --> 01:46:08,651
She's beautiful. She looks like an actor.

2599
01:46:09,481 --> 01:46:11,521
Her legs are this high on my body.

2600
01:46:11,891 --> 01:46:13,151
Yes, her legs are as high as my solar plexus.

2601
01:46:13,591 --> 01:46:15,520
(Getting ready)

2602
01:46:15,521 --> 01:46:16,831
She's going to go crazy.

2603
01:46:17,391 --> 01:46:19,631
I was kind of hunting her down.

2604
01:46:22,301 --> 01:46:24,231
I was a hungry soul in that battle.

2605
01:46:26,301 --> 01:46:27,901
Kylie's moves are all longish.

2606
01:46:30,611 --> 01:46:32,171
You just are really small.

2607
01:46:33,911 --> 01:46:34,911
Try this.

2608
01:46:35,381 --> 01:46:36,381
Yes!

2609
01:46:39,881 --> 01:46:42,581
(Change her expression suddenly.)

2610
01:46:44,791 --> 01:46:46,120
(Shocked)

2611
01:46:46,121 --> 01:46:47,561
Oh my gosh, her eyes.

2612
01:46:47,991 --> 01:46:49,021
What's going on?

2613
01:46:49,491 --> 01:46:52,531
Changing suddenly. She became a totally different person.

2614
01:46:52,991 --> 01:46:54,861
I was really shocked at that time.

2615
01:46:55,501 --> 01:46:58,300
- Look at her.
- Look at her eyes.

2616
01:46:58,301 --> 01:46:59,301
(Shocked)

2617
01:46:59,601 --> 01:47:02,171
Oh, nasty!

2618
01:47:02,901 --> 01:47:04,440
(Encore)

2619
01:47:04,441 --> 01:47:07,241
Showing me moves I hadn't seen before.

2620
01:47:07,581 --> 01:47:08,611
Kylie was a little better.

2621
01:47:09,441 --> 01:47:12,251
(Winning in all the battles)

2622
01:47:12,381 --> 01:47:14,181
(ROYAL FAMILY is on a winning streak.)

2623
01:47:14,381 --> 01:47:15,981
ROYAL FAMILY hasn't lost at all.

2624
01:47:16,121 --> 01:47:18,151
ROYAL FAMILY is doing well.

2625
01:47:19,021 --> 01:47:21,920
A lot of the ROYAL FAMILY's battles, I figured...

2626
01:47:21,921 --> 01:47:23,861
that's what they do. They're doing their thing.

2627
01:47:23,961 --> 01:47:25,660
I don't think they're sixth anymore.

2628
01:47:25,661 --> 01:47:26,661
(Accepting)

2629
01:47:26,662 --> 01:47:30,571
(Dopamine rush)

2630
01:47:30,831 --> 01:47:31,901
Someone call me out.

2631
01:47:32,731 --> 01:47:34,570
I was very excited.

2632
01:47:34,571 --> 01:47:36,771
I knew we could prove it went wrong.

2633
01:47:37,071 --> 01:47:40,281
Don't underestimate us. We're coming for you.

2634
01:47:40,581 --> 01:47:42,711
We are in first place.

2635
01:47:43,581 --> 01:47:46,351
We were rubbing it in their faces that they ranked us sixth.

2636
01:47:46,451 --> 01:47:47,451
I was like this.

2637
01:47:47,452 --> 01:47:48,721
(It serves you right.)

2638
01:47:53,791 --> 01:47:56,321
(AG SQUAD lost to ROYAL FAMILY in all the battles.)

2639
01:48:00,031 --> 01:48:01,031
The battles between the old and the new.

2640
01:48:01,131 --> 01:48:03,401
AG SQUAD lost to ROYAL FAMILY in all the battles.

2641
01:48:04,631 --> 01:48:07,071
It was really shocking to me.

2642
01:48:09,841 --> 01:48:13,011
We're the OG ROYAL FAMILY, but we lost.

2643
01:48:14,711 --> 01:48:18,611
I was pissed off because it's against the ROYAL FAMILY.

2644
01:48:20,521 --> 01:48:23,521
We're the new faces of the ROYAL FAMILY now.

2645
01:48:24,351 --> 01:48:26,320
(Mixed feelings)

2646
01:48:26,321 --> 01:48:28,291
I think ROYAL FAMILY won easily.

2647
01:48:28,391 --> 01:48:30,660
AG SQUAD is weaker in battle than I expected.

2648
01:48:30,661 --> 01:48:31,661
I think so, too.

2649
01:48:32,131 --> 01:48:34,161
Their moves seemed like we've seen a lot.

2650
01:48:34,561 --> 01:48:37,831
AG SQUAD ranked second as the expected winner.

2651
01:48:38,731 --> 01:48:41,241
(AG SQUAD ranked 2nd as the expected winner by crews.)

2652
01:48:42,541 --> 01:48:45,011
Watching them doing battles, I think they're in trouble.

2653
01:48:50,511 --> 01:48:54,121
As Teesha from ROYAL FAMILY defeats Kaea from AG SQUAD,

2654
01:48:54,651 --> 01:48:56,520
it proves that the new generation is leading...

2655
01:48:56,521 --> 01:48:59,291
the ROYAL FAMILY, not the old generation.

2656
01:49:03,291 --> 01:49:04,291
Cheer up.

2657
01:49:04,292 --> 01:49:05,530
(You did great.)

2658
01:49:05,531 --> 01:49:07,461
I think Kaea is under a lot of pressure.

2659
01:49:07,701 --> 01:49:10,571
- She is doing it in her name.
- She has to do it well.

2660
01:49:10,901 --> 01:49:13,901
But they're the OG ROYAL FAMILY. You know what I'm saying?

2661
01:49:16,241 --> 01:49:17,341
Oh, darn.

2662
01:49:19,511 --> 01:49:22,941
I mean, there's a lot of expectation on me.

2663
01:49:23,141 --> 01:49:25,751
They have that expectation for me to be amazing.

2664
01:49:28,221 --> 01:49:29,981
So, okay.

2665
01:49:30,351 --> 01:49:31,421
I'm sweating.

2666
01:49:33,321 --> 01:49:35,060
The ex-ROYAL FAMILY?

2667
01:49:35,061 --> 01:49:36,521
The real deal is here.

2668
01:49:37,991 --> 01:49:39,861
So there's a lot of pressure on me.

2669
01:49:42,001 --> 01:49:44,131
It's just all so much.

2670
01:49:45,971 --> 01:49:48,600
That was very scary to start with.

2671
01:49:48,601 --> 01:49:49,941
Like I was shaking.

2672
01:49:50,201 --> 01:49:51,571
I can do that.

2673
01:49:52,741 --> 01:49:55,710
People think the original generation is stronger...

2674
01:49:55,711 --> 01:49:58,380
than the new generation of ROYAL FAMILY.

2675
01:49:58,381 --> 01:50:00,281
(Who could beat the original ROYAL FAMILY?)

2676
01:50:00,521 --> 01:50:03,221
So there was a lot of pressure on my shoulders to win that battle.

2677
01:50:04,791 --> 01:50:05,850
Come on.

2678
01:50:05,851 --> 01:50:07,321
(People's expectations put Kaea under pressure.)

2679
01:50:09,191 --> 01:50:10,490
(Relaxed)

2680
01:50:10,491 --> 01:50:11,691
ROYAL FAMILY did...

2681
01:50:12,261 --> 01:50:13,960
bring up. They did fine.

2682
01:50:13,961 --> 01:50:16,000
But AG SQUAD is my team...

2683
01:50:16,001 --> 01:50:17,501
that I am the leader of.

2684
01:50:18,471 --> 01:50:20,600
We just thank you for this opportunity...

2685
01:50:20,601 --> 01:50:22,100
that you have blessed us.

2686
01:50:22,101 --> 01:50:23,101
(Kaea was serious about the battle more than any other time.)

2687
01:50:23,401 --> 01:50:24,441
Go.

2688
01:50:24,611 --> 01:50:26,141
I need to lead the girls.

2689
01:50:28,941 --> 01:50:31,310
(What's going to happen to AG SQUAD?)

2690
01:50:31,311 --> 01:50:33,411
The next battle dancer is...

2691
01:50:34,981 --> 01:50:35,981
Who's it going to be?

2692
01:50:35,982 --> 01:50:37,720
Tell us.

2693
01:50:37,721 --> 01:50:38,721
He's running out the clock.

2694
01:50:38,991 --> 01:50:40,761
I think it's somebody from Korea.

2695
01:50:41,261 --> 01:50:42,261
Team...

2696
01:50:42,891 --> 01:50:43,991
It's us.

2697
01:50:44,161 --> 01:50:46,091
Team Korea.

2698
01:50:46,791 --> 01:50:48,730
Team Korea BUMSUP's...

2699
01:50:48,731 --> 01:50:51,270
I didn't expect so many people to choose us.

2700
01:50:51,271 --> 01:50:53,471
Why is our team battling so much?

2701
01:50:54,041 --> 01:50:55,041
Korea.

2702
01:50:55,141 --> 01:50:56,141
Us?

2703
01:50:56,371 --> 01:50:57,511
Korea.

2704
01:50:58,111 --> 01:51:00,140
- Us again?
- Team Korea.

2705
01:51:00,141 --> 01:51:01,141
(People kept choosing Team Korea as No Respect Dancers.)

2706
01:51:01,142 --> 01:51:02,511
Open your cards.

2707
01:51:02,941 --> 01:51:04,451
(And they continued to lose.)

2708
01:51:04,651 --> 01:51:07,050
We kept on losing.

2709
01:51:07,051 --> 01:51:09,380
Our team lost three times in a row.

2710
01:51:09,381 --> 01:51:11,420
We were all down and looked serious.

2711
01:51:11,421 --> 01:51:13,190
Actually, Aiki never stops laughing.

2712
01:51:13,191 --> 01:51:14,790
We were all exhausted...

2713
01:51:14,791 --> 01:51:17,190
because everyone pointed at us.

2714
01:51:17,191 --> 01:51:19,391
I thought we were getting bullied.

2715
01:51:19,561 --> 01:51:22,800
Team Korea BUMSUP's...

2716
01:51:22,801 --> 01:51:24,101
I was so nervous.

2717
01:51:24,831 --> 01:51:27,070
BUMSUP's Gabee.

2718
01:51:27,071 --> 01:51:28,870
(Gabee of BUMSUP)

2719
01:51:28,871 --> 01:51:30,201
Let's go.

2720
01:51:32,471 --> 01:51:35,840
Finally my time.

2721
01:51:35,841 --> 01:51:37,150
Oh, my gosh.

2722
01:51:37,151 --> 01:51:38,650
Gabee.

2723
01:51:38,651 --> 01:51:40,181
(She's here.)

2724
01:51:40,581 --> 01:51:44,190
I've been waiting for so long.

2725
01:51:44,191 --> 01:51:45,520
I was under pressure,

2726
01:51:45,521 --> 01:51:47,590
but I decided to get out there...

2727
01:51:47,591 --> 01:51:49,061
and show them who I was.

2728
01:51:49,921 --> 01:51:51,361
Come on.

2729
01:51:53,431 --> 01:51:54,500
Hello.

2730
01:51:54,501 --> 01:51:55,900
Hi.

2731
01:51:55,901 --> 01:51:57,330
I like what Gabee's like.

2732
01:51:57,331 --> 01:51:59,671
I know that she is quite a performer.

2733
01:51:59,931 --> 01:52:01,770
(During the No Respect Battle in Season 1,)

2734
01:52:01,771 --> 01:52:03,570
(she shocked the fight zone with her unconventional performance.)

2735
01:52:03,571 --> 01:52:08,481
(Gabee impressed everyone by using the whole space like a stage.)

2736
01:52:09,341 --> 01:52:11,111
Gosh, her heels are high.

2737
01:52:11,481 --> 01:52:13,281
I kind of like her heels. They're cute.

2738
01:52:13,511 --> 01:52:14,651
Nice heels.

2739
01:52:14,721 --> 01:52:17,751
Gabee's really good at heel dancing.

2740
01:52:18,591 --> 01:52:20,590
Since high school,

2741
01:52:20,591 --> 01:52:23,820
I danced in heels.

2742
01:52:23,821 --> 01:52:26,431
I danced waacking in heels before.

2743
01:52:26,561 --> 01:52:28,130
If Gabee's on heels,

2744
01:52:28,131 --> 01:52:30,431
it means she's determined to win.

2745
01:52:30,631 --> 01:52:31,631
Gabee.

2746
01:52:31,901 --> 01:52:33,571
- Go, girl.
- Go, girl.

2747
01:52:33,971 --> 01:52:35,301
Okay.

2748
01:52:35,841 --> 01:52:38,771
The dancer...

2749
01:52:41,381 --> 01:52:42,441
I can beat is...

2750
01:52:43,211 --> 01:52:44,211
Let's go.

2751
01:52:44,511 --> 01:52:46,281
Oh, I'm excited.

2752
01:52:46,711 --> 01:52:48,021
From AG SQUAD.

2753
01:52:48,451 --> 01:52:49,851
(Focusing)

2754
01:52:50,081 --> 01:52:51,420
I think there are only the two of us.

2755
01:52:51,421 --> 01:52:53,521
I think there are only the two of us on heels.

2756
01:52:54,361 --> 01:52:55,361
Danica.

2757
01:52:55,362 --> 01:52:58,890
(Danica of AG SQUAD)

2758
01:52:58,891 --> 01:53:00,601
They have the same style.

2759
01:53:01,431 --> 01:53:03,231
Heel versus heel.

2760
01:53:03,531 --> 01:53:04,770
(Squealing)

2761
01:53:04,771 --> 01:53:07,870
They're the only ones doing the heel dance.

2762
01:53:07,871 --> 01:53:09,070
It's the heel battle.

2763
01:53:09,071 --> 01:53:10,940
When I looked around,

2764
01:53:10,941 --> 01:53:12,970
Danica and I were the only ones on heels.

2765
01:53:12,971 --> 01:53:14,510
(Okay. It's time to show her.)

2766
01:53:14,511 --> 01:53:16,140
- Go, Danica.
- Okay.

2767
01:53:16,141 --> 01:53:18,210
It's a mistake to choose.

2768
01:53:18,211 --> 01:53:21,221
Let's go, Danica. I'm so excited for you.

2769
01:53:21,381 --> 01:53:23,651
- Shine, girl.
- Shine.

2770
01:53:24,691 --> 01:53:27,890
She is quite flexible, and she can do heels.

2771
01:53:27,891 --> 01:53:31,190
She's very sexy, and she can do tricks.

2772
01:53:31,191 --> 01:53:33,230
She can battle in her heel.

2773
01:53:33,231 --> 01:53:38,170
If I were to rank the other heels choreography dancers on the show,

2774
01:53:38,171 --> 01:53:40,301
I'd put myself first.

2775
01:53:41,001 --> 01:53:42,700
Heels. Heels, girls.

2776
01:53:42,701 --> 01:53:43,941
(Paying attention)

2777
01:53:46,471 --> 01:53:48,110
I think I did heels.

2778
01:53:48,111 --> 01:53:50,751
I didn't see anything from her in heel, and I feel that.

2779
01:53:51,481 --> 01:53:53,481
(Frozen)

2780
01:53:53,781 --> 01:53:55,820
(What?)

2781
01:53:55,821 --> 01:53:57,521
- She didn't see anything?
- She didn't see anything?

2782
01:53:58,151 --> 01:53:59,220
She didn't see anything.

2783
01:53:59,221 --> 01:54:00,451
Look at her.

2784
01:54:03,121 --> 01:54:05,630
Danica copied my dance.

2785
01:54:05,631 --> 01:54:06,960
It hurt my pride.

2786
01:54:06,961 --> 01:54:08,460
I decided to beat her.

2787
01:54:08,461 --> 01:54:09,901
It's you. Come on out.

2788
01:54:10,201 --> 01:54:12,230
Tighten up those heels, sister.

2789
01:54:12,231 --> 01:54:13,931
Let's get to battling!

2790
01:54:14,141 --> 01:54:16,500
We can beat them dancing in heels.

2791
01:54:16,501 --> 01:54:19,040
I'm ready. I'm always ready.

2792
01:54:19,041 --> 01:54:22,641
Gabee is such a great dancer.

2793
01:54:22,881 --> 01:54:24,481
And she's best at the heel dance.

2794
01:54:25,151 --> 01:54:26,210
How do girls do that?

2795
01:54:26,211 --> 01:54:28,081
We are superwomen, man.

2796
01:54:28,281 --> 01:54:29,520
I can't even walk.

2797
01:54:29,521 --> 01:54:31,790
I know. It's not an easy thing.

2798
01:54:31,791 --> 01:54:32,890
I'm nervous.

2799
01:54:32,891 --> 01:54:34,861
We don't have any other choice but to win.

2800
01:54:35,121 --> 01:54:36,860
This is a really important battle.

2801
01:54:36,861 --> 01:54:38,531
I have to win.

2802
01:54:38,831 --> 01:54:42,130
I thought that might be our chance.

2803
01:54:42,131 --> 01:54:43,631
Gabee of Team Korea versus...

2804
01:54:44,171 --> 01:54:46,201
Danica of Team Australia.

2805
01:54:46,601 --> 01:54:49,270
Their battle will begin.

2806
01:54:49,271 --> 01:54:50,271
- Danica!
- Ready?

2807
01:54:50,272 --> 01:54:51,771
- Queen Gabee.
- Fight.

2808
01:54:54,041 --> 01:54:55,441
Focus and win.

2809
01:54:56,581 --> 01:54:57,651
Just be myself.

2810
01:54:57,851 --> 01:54:59,151
I'm ready to dance.

2811
01:54:59,511 --> 01:55:00,511
Gabee.

2812
01:55:00,512 --> 01:55:01,750
(Gabee of BUMSUP goes first.)

2813
01:55:01,751 --> 01:55:03,020
(The queen is here.)

2814
01:55:03,021 --> 01:55:04,521
Let's go.

2815
01:55:06,491 --> 01:55:08,361
(That's it!)

2816
01:55:08,421 --> 01:55:09,421
(Thrilling)

2817
01:55:09,961 --> 01:55:12,131
The black dragon burning inside me.

2818
01:55:14,161 --> 01:55:16,101
Get a little more for me.

2819
01:55:20,201 --> 01:55:21,241
Let's go.

2820
01:55:21,441 --> 01:55:23,041
I'll show the best of me.

2821
01:55:26,911 --> 01:55:27,911
What was it?

2822
01:55:27,912 --> 01:55:29,311
No. I don't see any.

2823
01:55:32,211 --> 01:55:33,480
When Gabee's on the floor,

2824
01:55:33,481 --> 01:55:35,150
people want something thrilling.

2825
01:55:35,151 --> 01:55:36,151
(The thrill is ready.)

2826
01:55:36,152 --> 01:55:37,591
(No Respect sticker)

2827
01:55:39,321 --> 01:55:40,760
(Slam)

2828
01:55:40,761 --> 01:55:42,520
(What was that?)

2829
01:55:42,521 --> 01:55:44,490
(What did I just see?)

2830
01:55:44,491 --> 01:55:45,491
I was surprised.

2831
01:55:45,491 --> 01:55:46,491
(Laughing)

2832
01:55:48,961 --> 01:55:50,360
What the heck?

2833
01:55:50,361 --> 01:55:51,771
Feels upsetting.

2834
01:55:52,831 --> 01:55:54,671
I don't know what's up with that, but...

2835
01:55:55,171 --> 01:55:58,311
This is how crazy I am about battling.

2836
01:55:59,111 --> 01:56:00,711
Show them.

2837
01:56:00,881 --> 01:56:03,041
(In a trance)

2838
01:56:03,281 --> 01:56:04,481
We got this.

2839
01:56:04,681 --> 01:56:06,310
(That's it!)

2840
01:56:06,311 --> 01:56:08,321
No matter what you do, I'm still winning.

2841
01:56:08,781 --> 01:56:10,520
I must show them.

2842
01:56:10,521 --> 01:56:11,521
Look at me.

2843
01:56:11,721 --> 01:56:15,320
(Getting possessed)

2844
01:56:15,321 --> 01:56:17,190
I was quite surprised.

2845
01:56:17,191 --> 01:56:19,430
Danica, clear her up.

2846
01:56:19,431 --> 01:56:21,960
This is how much I can overwhelm the audience.

2847
01:56:21,961 --> 01:56:22,961
Let's go!

2848
01:56:22,962 --> 01:56:24,231
(Me too.)

2849
01:56:24,831 --> 01:56:26,131
That's awesome.

2850
01:56:27,031 --> 01:56:29,370
Countdown. Five, four,

2851
01:56:29,371 --> 01:56:31,710
three, two, one.

2852
01:56:31,711 --> 01:56:33,971
Switch. AG SQUAD's Danica.

2853
01:56:34,881 --> 01:56:36,581
She has the star quality.

2854
01:56:36,711 --> 01:56:38,451
(Yoga Gabee)

2855
01:56:38,651 --> 01:56:41,220
It felt like I did my share. It felt so refreshing.

2856
01:56:41,221 --> 01:56:42,650
- Switch. AG SQUAD's Danica.
- We're just completely...

2857
01:56:42,651 --> 01:56:44,081
different dancers.

2858
01:56:45,291 --> 01:56:46,790
Let's go.

2859
01:56:46,791 --> 01:56:47,791
(Danica of AG SQUAD goes next.)

2860
01:56:47,891 --> 01:56:48,891
Let's go.

2861
01:56:49,521 --> 01:56:51,031
I'll show you how I dance.

2862
01:56:55,401 --> 01:56:56,531
(She nailed it.)

2863
01:56:57,771 --> 01:56:59,331
Showing them that they're wrong.

2864
01:56:59,901 --> 01:57:00,971
I'm not interested.

2865
01:57:07,111 --> 01:57:08,581
(Surprised)

2866
01:57:08,681 --> 01:57:09,881
Let's go.

2867
01:57:10,111 --> 01:57:11,411
Can you do that?

2868
01:57:11,581 --> 01:57:13,581
I think we'd have a little fun with that one.

2869
01:57:13,911 --> 01:57:15,720
Danica's much better.

2870
01:57:15,721 --> 01:57:17,951
She didn't really stand out.

2871
01:57:18,391 --> 01:57:19,591
Go, Danica.

2872
01:57:19,791 --> 01:57:21,621
I'd be won easily.

2873
01:57:22,091 --> 01:57:23,461
Let's see how good you are.

2874
01:57:26,661 --> 01:57:28,631
(Exclaiming)

2875
01:57:33,071 --> 01:57:34,071
(Here is her killer move.)

2876
01:57:36,401 --> 01:57:37,401
Let's do it.

2877
01:57:37,671 --> 01:57:40,210
I felt really good about my performance.

2878
01:57:40,211 --> 01:57:41,881
BUMSUP!

2879
01:57:42,711 --> 01:57:44,510
I don't have to watch her.

2880
01:57:44,511 --> 01:57:45,881
I didn't feel comfortable watching her.

2881
01:57:46,751 --> 01:57:48,051
Go, Danica.

2882
01:57:48,921 --> 01:57:50,381
I performed well and...

2883
01:57:50,721 --> 01:57:52,390
grabbed everyone's attention in the room.

2884
01:57:52,391 --> 01:57:54,920
Let's go.

2885
01:57:54,921 --> 01:57:56,561
I did better.

2886
01:57:57,191 --> 01:57:59,690
Deeply think that we can win.

2887
01:57:59,691 --> 01:58:02,400
Countdown. Five, four,

2888
01:58:02,401 --> 01:58:05,230
three, two, one.

2889
01:58:05,231 --> 01:58:07,171
The battle is over.

2890
01:58:07,641 --> 01:58:08,801
Oh, my gosh.

2891
01:58:09,001 --> 01:58:10,370
Danica.

2892
01:58:10,371 --> 01:58:11,871
You stayed in your pocket.

2893
01:58:12,141 --> 01:58:13,141
Yes.

2894
01:58:13,271 --> 01:58:15,911
Technically amazing dancing skills.

2895
01:58:16,341 --> 01:58:17,750
Sexy dynamite.

2896
01:58:17,751 --> 01:58:19,580
That's what you call the heel dance.

2897
01:58:19,581 --> 01:58:22,680
(Impressed)

2898
01:58:22,681 --> 01:58:24,920
Really, I can't choose.

2899
01:58:24,921 --> 01:58:25,921
No. Yes.

2900
01:58:26,751 --> 01:58:28,520
- Period. She did it.
- Dang.

2901
01:58:28,521 --> 01:58:30,790
I consider that sexy.

2902
01:58:30,791 --> 01:58:31,890
That's more sexy.

2903
01:58:31,891 --> 01:58:33,860
Instead of going, "Pow."

2904
01:58:33,861 --> 01:58:36,801
Gabee knows how to brighten up the mood.

2905
01:58:36,961 --> 01:58:38,371
That's what you call a performance.

2906
01:58:40,701 --> 01:58:42,500
Technically better.

2907
01:58:42,501 --> 01:58:44,611
You pulled it off.

2908
01:58:45,811 --> 01:58:47,141
Need for a rematch or not?

2909
01:58:47,371 --> 01:58:48,381
Yes.

2910
01:58:49,941 --> 01:58:50,951
I'm really sorry,

2911
01:58:51,151 --> 01:58:52,151
but we can't choose.

2912
01:58:52,411 --> 01:58:54,720
(We can't choose.)

2913
01:58:54,721 --> 01:58:56,751
We have to do another one.

2914
01:58:57,421 --> 01:58:58,890
- What?
- One more round?

2915
01:58:58,891 --> 01:59:00,021
Rematch.

2916
01:59:00,821 --> 01:59:01,891
Right, girl.

2917
01:59:02,361 --> 01:59:03,621
Let's go.

2918
01:59:03,961 --> 01:59:05,390
Just can't choose.

2919
01:59:05,391 --> 01:59:06,890
Again.

2920
01:59:06,891 --> 01:59:08,230
I won't give up easily.

2921
01:59:08,231 --> 01:59:10,100
And this confidence in my abilities.

2922
01:59:10,101 --> 01:59:11,471
You're Queen Gabee.

2923
01:59:11,871 --> 01:59:13,170
I have to do it.

2924
01:59:13,171 --> 01:59:15,670
I'll grind my soul to it.

2925
01:59:15,671 --> 01:59:18,411
It's a rematch.

2926
01:59:19,141 --> 01:59:21,910
Two dancers must show their moves...

2927
01:59:21,911 --> 01:59:25,111
to the same music for 40 seconds.

2928
01:59:25,581 --> 01:59:27,350
Will they dance at the same time?

2929
01:59:27,351 --> 01:59:28,351
That's incredible.

2930
01:59:28,352 --> 01:59:29,420
Both dancers, good luck.

2931
01:59:29,421 --> 01:59:31,190
I didn't want to do this.

2932
01:59:31,191 --> 01:59:33,521
I decided to give my everything.

2933
01:59:33,621 --> 01:59:36,060
Keep doing what you do best. Be you.

2934
01:59:36,061 --> 01:59:37,521
We have to win this.

2935
01:59:38,231 --> 01:59:39,391
Are you guys ready?

2936
01:59:40,061 --> 01:59:41,201
Let's do this.

2937
01:59:41,531 --> 01:59:43,631
You can do it. You practiced hard.

2938
01:59:43,701 --> 01:59:44,931
Are you guys ready?

2939
01:59:45,301 --> 01:59:46,371
Fight!

2940
01:59:47,741 --> 01:59:48,800
Let's go!

2941
01:59:48,801 --> 01:59:50,470
I decided to show my moves.

2942
01:59:50,471 --> 01:59:51,671
Danica!

2943
01:59:51,971 --> 01:59:53,511
I'm ready to show everyone.

2944
01:59:57,111 --> 01:59:59,210
It feels like second nature to me when I'm in heels.

2945
01:59:59,211 --> 02:00:00,881
Look at the technique.

2946
02:00:01,351 --> 02:00:02,780
Danica!

2947
02:00:02,781 --> 02:00:04,651
I'll show everyone how crazy I am.

2948
02:00:06,321 --> 02:00:08,221
(Gabee gets started.)

2949
02:00:09,161 --> 02:00:10,921
(Let's go.)

2950
02:00:12,461 --> 02:00:13,590
(Shocked)

2951
02:00:13,591 --> 02:00:15,561
(My goodness)

2952
02:00:19,171 --> 02:00:20,431
That's not dancing.

2953
02:00:21,171 --> 02:00:22,471
The battle is all about the spirit.

2954
02:00:25,971 --> 02:00:28,081
- Yes, Danica!
- Let's go!

2955
02:00:28,281 --> 02:00:30,041
Danica!

2956
02:00:30,481 --> 02:00:32,311
And just go full out.

2957
02:00:32,611 --> 02:00:34,351
- I need to pull up the spirit.
- Let's go.

2958
02:00:36,851 --> 02:00:37,991
That's Gabee.

2959
02:00:40,321 --> 02:00:41,690
Okay.

2960
02:00:41,691 --> 02:00:43,621
Let's go!

2961
02:00:47,061 --> 02:00:48,731
I have more heel techniques.

2962
02:00:51,171 --> 02:00:52,230
Did you see that?

2963
02:00:52,231 --> 02:00:53,601
(I saw that!)

2964
02:00:56,041 --> 02:00:58,511
If we're dancing at the same time, I have to step forward.

2965
02:01:00,511 --> 02:01:02,480
(Gabee puts herself in front of Danica.)

2966
02:01:02,481 --> 02:01:04,681
Let's go!

2967
02:01:06,211 --> 02:01:07,721
- Hey!
- Move!

2968
02:01:08,021 --> 02:01:09,581
Since I have come this far, I have to win.

2969
02:01:12,121 --> 02:01:13,291
She's trying to get attention.

2970
02:01:15,691 --> 02:01:18,030
Countdown! Five, four,

2971
02:01:18,031 --> 02:01:20,531
- What was that?
- three, two...

2972
02:01:22,031 --> 02:01:24,061
I'll show everyone that I'm totally crazy.

2973
02:01:24,401 --> 02:01:25,471
I'm a nutjob.

2974
02:01:25,671 --> 02:01:28,671
Five, four, three,

2975
02:01:28,941 --> 02:01:31,141
- two, one.
- Let's go.

2976
02:01:31,271 --> 02:01:32,811
I'm no joke.

2977
02:01:33,671 --> 02:01:36,041
(They can't believe their eyes.)

2978
02:01:36,411 --> 02:01:37,441
(What?)

2979
02:01:40,681 --> 02:01:41,881
(Come on.)

2980
02:01:45,491 --> 02:01:48,160
(Sitting on Aliya)

2981
02:01:48,161 --> 02:01:50,720
(The crazy ending makes everyone laugh.)

2982
02:01:50,721 --> 02:01:51,890
Oh, my gosh.

2983
02:01:51,891 --> 02:01:52,891
(Thank you.)

2984
02:01:52,892 --> 02:01:54,291
That's crazy.

2985
02:01:54,731 --> 02:01:57,201
She's a total nutjob.

2986
02:01:57,561 --> 02:01:58,930
(BUMSUP's Gabee versus AG SQUAD's Danica)

2987
02:01:58,931 --> 02:02:00,030
(The rematch battle ends.)

2988
02:02:00,031 --> 02:02:01,770
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

2989
02:02:01,771 --> 02:02:04,771
- You stayed focused. Well done.
- Yes, Danica.

2990
02:02:05,411 --> 02:02:06,940
That was dancing.

2991
02:02:06,941 --> 02:02:09,181
- She's the queen.
- I respect her so much.

2992
02:02:09,581 --> 02:02:11,350
I showed everyone what kind of a person I was.

2993
02:02:11,351 --> 02:02:13,511
I judged that I had a chance to win.

2994
02:02:13,651 --> 02:02:15,880
- I was so surprised.
- Her physical ability is no joke.

2995
02:02:15,881 --> 02:02:17,851
Should I go to the judges when I have a battle?

2996
02:02:18,321 --> 02:02:20,450
- How do you judge that?
- I'm about to give up.

2997
02:02:20,451 --> 02:02:22,461
Don't start with me, please.

2998
02:02:23,091 --> 02:02:26,761
From that battle, I expect myself to win, of course.

2999
02:02:27,291 --> 02:02:28,331
Please.

3000
02:02:28,531 --> 02:02:30,430
The team's victory depended on the battle,

3001
02:02:30,431 --> 02:02:31,731
so I was determined to win.

3002
02:02:31,801 --> 02:02:34,970
First of all, I was waiting...

3003
02:02:34,971 --> 02:02:38,771
for the queens to come out in heels. Y'all already know that.

3004
02:02:38,911 --> 02:02:41,180
So thank you, guys. Thank you both.

3005
02:02:41,181 --> 02:02:43,010
Danica has more sensuality.

3006
02:02:43,011 --> 02:02:45,350
She has more of, like, women's empowerment.

3007
02:02:45,351 --> 02:02:46,650
- Yes.
- She gave that.

3008
02:02:46,651 --> 02:02:49,120
I want to see more sensuality and slowness.

3009
02:02:49,121 --> 02:02:51,591
"I don't have to do so much to gain your attention."

3010
02:02:51,851 --> 02:02:52,990
That was what Danica did.

3011
02:02:52,991 --> 02:02:55,890
However, Gabee had more of the performance,

3012
02:02:55,891 --> 02:02:57,220
more of the star quality,

3013
02:02:57,221 --> 02:02:59,530
more of "Look at me!" Do you know what I'm saying?

3014
02:02:59,531 --> 02:03:02,060
Gabee, you gave me the better dance.

3015
02:03:02,061 --> 02:03:05,971
Danica, you gave me the better heel dance.

3016
02:03:07,001 --> 02:03:08,970
Better dance, better heel dance.

3017
02:03:08,971 --> 02:03:11,970
- That makes sense.
- That makes sense.

3018
02:03:11,971 --> 02:03:15,180
The battle element ends up being like,

3019
02:03:15,181 --> 02:03:16,880
"Who can catch the eye?"

3020
02:03:16,881 --> 02:03:18,110
- Oh, yes.
- I feel like...

3021
02:03:18,111 --> 02:03:19,081
it ends up being like,

3022
02:03:19,082 --> 02:03:21,521
"Who wants it more? Who has that fire?"

3023
02:03:22,521 --> 02:03:23,781
Which one will it be?

3024
02:03:24,281 --> 02:03:25,391
This is hard.

3025
02:03:25,691 --> 02:03:26,751
Fight judges,

3026
02:03:27,621 --> 02:03:28,691
open...

3027
02:03:29,961 --> 02:03:31,760
Since I have come this far, I have to win.

3028
02:03:31,761 --> 02:03:33,990
I think I'll win this battle.

3029
02:03:33,991 --> 02:03:35,061
I don't know.

3030
02:03:36,001 --> 02:03:37,130
Come on now.

3031
02:03:37,131 --> 02:03:39,001
Open your cards.

3032
02:03:39,931 --> 02:03:41,970
(Mike Song chooses BUMSUP.)

3033
02:03:41,971 --> 02:03:43,071
Please.

3034
02:03:44,201 --> 02:03:46,170
(Park Jin Young chooses AG SQUAD.)

3035
02:03:46,171 --> 02:03:47,440
I'm nervous.

3036
02:03:47,441 --> 02:03:48,940
(Torn)

3037
02:03:48,941 --> 02:03:50,110
Please.

3038
02:03:50,111 --> 02:03:51,350
(Praying)

3039
02:03:51,351 --> 02:03:52,451
(Whom will Aliya Janell choose?)

3040
02:03:53,251 --> 02:03:56,381
(She chooses BUMSUP!)

3041
02:03:58,791 --> 02:04:00,950
(Gabee wins after a close match.)

3042
02:04:00,951 --> 02:04:02,790
But Gabee was like,

3043
02:04:02,791 --> 02:04:04,760
all over the freaking room.

3044
02:04:04,761 --> 02:04:07,960
Obviously, our eyes are going to her, you know.

3045
02:04:07,961 --> 02:04:09,201
And this is a battle.

3046
02:04:10,201 --> 02:04:11,970
(Gabee of BUMSUP wins.)

3047
02:04:11,971 --> 02:04:13,730
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

3048
02:04:13,731 --> 02:04:15,501
She knows how to be on the show, for sure.

3049
02:04:15,971 --> 02:04:17,370
Gabee, big sister.

3050
02:04:17,371 --> 02:04:20,411
(We're proud of you.)

3051
02:04:22,811 --> 02:04:24,341
I could feel that the crew members were happy.

3052
02:04:24,711 --> 02:04:26,350
They were like, "Gabee, you did an amazing job."

3053
02:04:26,351 --> 02:04:28,050
("Mek It Bums Up!")

3054
02:04:28,051 --> 02:04:29,921
Well done.

3055
02:04:30,281 --> 02:04:32,920
I really wanted to hear the crew song.

3056
02:04:32,921 --> 02:04:34,620
We're finally listening to it.

3057
02:04:34,621 --> 02:04:36,120
This song is so nice.

3058
02:04:36,121 --> 02:04:37,521
I didn't know that the song was so nice.

3059
02:04:43,761 --> 02:04:45,630
Did you do any other shows here in Korea?

3060
02:04:45,631 --> 02:04:47,130
Just this one. Yes.

3061
02:04:47,131 --> 02:04:49,370
Was Season Two this hardcore?

3062
02:04:49,371 --> 02:04:51,371
- Season Two was harder.
- Really?

3063
02:04:51,571 --> 02:04:54,040
(He began as a special judge on "Street Man Fighter.")

3064
02:04:54,041 --> 02:04:55,440
(Then he visited often as a special judge...)

3065
02:04:55,441 --> 02:04:56,810
(for "Street Woman Fighter 2")

3066
02:04:56,811 --> 02:04:57,950
Respect.

3067
02:04:57,951 --> 02:04:59,510
(Then he became a regular judge on "World of Street Woman Fighter.")

3068
02:04:59,511 --> 02:05:01,751
Mike, how much Korean do you understand?

3069
02:05:02,281 --> 02:05:03,821
- Nearly all. Yes.
- Really?

3070
02:05:04,021 --> 02:05:05,790
Your "I'll teach you a lesson" pun.

3071
02:05:05,791 --> 02:05:09,521
(He mixes in Korean words when he critiques in English.)

3072
02:05:09,721 --> 02:05:10,721
(Laughing)

3073
02:05:11,561 --> 02:05:13,760
- He's cute.
- Seriously,

3074
02:05:13,761 --> 02:05:15,500
he's a true teacher.

3075
02:05:15,501 --> 02:05:16,900
Mike Song,

3076
02:05:16,901 --> 02:05:19,330
he just knows a good dancer when he sees them.

3077
02:05:19,331 --> 02:05:20,370
What's her name?

3078
02:05:20,371 --> 02:05:22,300
Fantaye. Yes.

3079
02:05:22,301 --> 02:05:23,840
She's a freestyler.

3080
02:05:23,841 --> 02:05:25,870
- Do you know about Marlee?
- No. Who is she?

3081
02:05:25,871 --> 02:05:27,740
She's been making a lot of noise right now.

3082
02:05:27,741 --> 02:05:29,281
Kyoka is...

3083
02:05:29,841 --> 02:05:31,480
She's a beast.

3084
02:05:31,481 --> 02:05:34,511
Lip J is going to come out and kill it.

3085
02:05:34,821 --> 02:05:36,521
Mike, what would you be thinking about right now?

3086
02:05:36,751 --> 02:05:38,450
I don't know. I could see another round.

3087
02:05:38,451 --> 02:05:41,721
This is just top world champions battling.

3088
02:05:41,821 --> 02:05:44,991
He's an essential figure among the judges.

3089
02:05:46,761 --> 02:05:47,930
As for the judging...

3090
02:05:47,931 --> 02:05:49,860
- JYP.
- Since "K-pop Star,"

3091
02:05:49,861 --> 02:05:50,861
he has done really well.

3092
02:05:53,371 --> 02:05:54,371
(His face grows cold.)

3093
02:05:57,871 --> 02:05:59,140
(Disappointed)

3094
02:05:59,141 --> 02:06:01,940
One thing you don't want to do as a performer is...

3095
02:06:01,941 --> 02:06:04,041
going ahead of the music.

3096
02:06:04,141 --> 02:06:07,281
We know how good you are at what you just showed us.

3097
02:06:07,581 --> 02:06:10,020
We just want to know. Can you just dance to it?

3098
02:06:10,021 --> 02:06:11,521
The oral level is already...

3099
02:06:12,291 --> 02:06:14,151
His comments are no joke.

3100
02:06:14,451 --> 02:06:16,061
He's been making the right calls.

3101
02:06:17,421 --> 02:06:20,690
(Japanese?)

3102
02:06:20,691 --> 02:06:22,160
What? Does he speak Japanese as well?

3103
02:06:22,161 --> 02:06:23,530
(Moved)

3104
02:06:23,531 --> 02:06:26,070
You had the strategy and proceeded with it calmly.

3105
02:06:26,071 --> 02:06:27,101
It was so cool.

3106
02:06:27,231 --> 02:06:30,170
(Korean, English, Japanese, and body language)

3107
02:06:30,171 --> 02:06:32,711
(He speaks 4 languages in total.)

3108
02:06:33,041 --> 02:06:35,280
(He can't hide his instinct to dance.)

3109
02:06:35,281 --> 02:06:36,681
The judges are fun.

3110
02:06:36,841 --> 02:06:38,680
(Is someone next to him going wild?)

3111
02:06:38,681 --> 02:06:39,711
(The appearance of the queen of reactions)

3112
02:06:39,911 --> 02:06:44,251
(This is how Aliya Janell enjoys "World of Street Woman Fighter.")

3113
02:06:44,451 --> 02:06:46,051
(She's singing along.)

3114
02:06:46,791 --> 02:06:51,221
(Step 1. Enjoy the music to your heart's content.)

3115
02:06:51,561 --> 02:06:53,831
(This is so much fun.)

3116
02:06:53,931 --> 02:06:55,100
(Laughing)

3117
02:06:55,101 --> 02:06:56,701
We've never been in this situation before.

3118
02:06:56,931 --> 02:06:57,931
It's so funny.

3119
02:06:58,201 --> 02:07:00,900
(I don't know)

3120
02:07:00,901 --> 02:07:03,301
It's a real American reaction.

3121
02:07:03,401 --> 02:07:05,311
Her expressions are different.

3122
02:07:05,411 --> 02:07:06,670
Come on!

3123
02:07:06,671 --> 02:07:07,940
(Startled)

3124
02:07:07,941 --> 02:07:10,681
(Step 2. Speak with your facial expressions.)

3125
02:07:10,911 --> 02:07:12,810
(After showing a pure smile,)

3126
02:07:12,811 --> 02:07:14,281
(she suddenly becomes serious.)

3127
02:07:14,851 --> 02:07:16,920
(Meaning: I'm surprised.)

3128
02:07:16,921 --> 02:07:19,191
(Meaning: I respect that.)

3129
02:07:19,291 --> 02:07:20,750
(Meaning: That's it!)

3130
02:07:20,751 --> 02:07:22,321
(Meaning: What just happened?)

3131
02:07:22,761 --> 02:07:24,221
(When she's overly focused, her reactions become broken.)

3132
02:07:24,491 --> 02:07:25,561
Look at her facial expression.

3133
02:07:26,991 --> 02:07:28,161
That's so cute.

3134
02:07:28,231 --> 02:07:30,561
(Step 3. React with your entire body.)

3135
02:07:30,901 --> 02:07:32,931
(Full of good cheer)

3136
02:07:33,501 --> 02:07:37,170
(She has so much good cheer that she can't sit still.)

3137
02:07:37,171 --> 02:07:38,271
She's good.

3138
02:07:39,341 --> 02:07:41,041
(The symptom of getting up spreads among the judges.)

3139
02:07:41,141 --> 02:07:43,281
(Aliya enjoys the show in various ways.)

3140
02:07:44,241 --> 02:07:45,250
(Laughing)

3141
02:07:45,251 --> 02:07:47,910
She livens up the atmosphere in a very positive way.

3142
02:07:47,911 --> 02:07:50,320
That's the attitude I want to learn.

3143
02:07:50,321 --> 02:07:52,250
It felt so nice. Seriously.

3144
02:07:52,251 --> 02:07:54,220
The matter of winning and losing wasn't important then.

3145
02:07:54,221 --> 02:07:55,221
(Aliya gives the dancers strength with her good cheer and reactions.)

3146
02:07:55,222 --> 02:07:57,391
Yes. There are still a lot of people I want to see.

3147
02:07:57,761 --> 02:08:00,131
The next battler is...

3148
02:08:00,961 --> 02:08:03,831
(Their hearts beat fast.)

3149
02:08:03,901 --> 02:08:06,871
Team Japan...

3150
02:08:08,401 --> 02:08:09,571
(Oh, my)

3151
02:08:10,371 --> 02:08:11,401
Which one?

3152
02:08:12,641 --> 02:08:16,610
OSAKA Ojo Gang's...

3153
02:08:16,611 --> 02:08:17,841
(That's us!)

3154
02:08:19,181 --> 02:08:20,250
Ibuki.

3155
02:08:20,251 --> 02:08:22,621
(The leader of OSAKA Ojo Gang, Ibuki)

3156
02:08:24,481 --> 02:08:27,091
(Finally!)

3157
02:08:28,391 --> 02:08:30,221
I can't wait to see her dance.

3158
02:08:31,261 --> 02:08:33,330
(Hold on a second. The time has come.)

3159
02:08:33,331 --> 02:08:35,300
Let's go.

3160
02:08:35,301 --> 02:08:36,831
Let's go.

3161
02:08:37,361 --> 02:08:40,470
Ibuki is very famous in the battling scene.

3162
02:08:40,471 --> 02:08:41,841
She's the strongest waacker.

3163
02:08:42,241 --> 02:08:43,440
Let's go.

3164
02:08:43,441 --> 02:08:46,811
(Who is the dancer who captivated everyone's attention?)

3165
02:08:48,641 --> 02:08:50,940
(BUMSUP members go insane.)

3166
02:08:50,941 --> 02:08:54,411
Oh, my gosh. Will Ibuki go next?

3167
02:08:54,511 --> 02:08:58,720
Ibuki is the waacker who represents Japan.

3168
02:08:58,721 --> 02:09:00,021
She never loses in a battle.

3169
02:09:00,421 --> 02:09:02,821
She has the image of taking a win after a win.

3170
02:09:03,061 --> 02:09:05,930
As a fellow contestant on a show, it hurts my pride to say this.

3171
02:09:05,931 --> 02:09:07,260
But Ibuki is legendary.

3172
02:09:07,261 --> 02:09:08,460
It isn't just the waackers.

3173
02:09:08,461 --> 02:09:11,600
Even dancers of other genres know about Ibuki.

3174
02:09:11,601 --> 02:09:12,731
That's an explanation enough.

3175
02:09:13,271 --> 02:09:16,800
What's your level in the world waacking scene?

3176
02:09:16,801 --> 02:09:17,900
Top one.

3177
02:09:17,901 --> 02:09:19,311
(Confident)

3178
02:09:19,511 --> 02:09:21,210
Seriously, when it comes to the battles...

3179
02:09:21,211 --> 02:09:26,010
I've won so many competitions.

3180
02:09:26,011 --> 02:09:27,050
We heard the rumors.

3181
02:09:27,051 --> 02:09:29,521
"She practices like this."

3182
02:09:29,681 --> 02:09:32,891
I say she wrote the history in waacking.

3183
02:09:33,621 --> 02:09:36,920
I'm a world-famous waacking dancer,

3184
02:09:36,921 --> 02:09:39,760
so everyone would know my name.

3185
02:09:39,761 --> 02:09:42,601
The dancer I can beat...

3186
02:09:43,961 --> 02:09:45,430
(Glaring)

3187
02:09:45,431 --> 02:09:46,601
RHTokyo?

3188
02:09:47,971 --> 02:09:49,600
(This is fun.)

3189
02:09:49,601 --> 02:09:50,671
Let's go.

3190
02:09:52,141 --> 02:09:56,611
Do I even have to say it?

3191
02:09:57,041 --> 02:09:58,041
It's here.

3192
02:10:03,281 --> 02:10:04,321
Go.

3193
02:10:06,191 --> 02:10:09,161
Team Korea.

3194
02:10:10,861 --> 02:10:13,261
She's here!

3195
02:10:13,691 --> 02:10:14,931
Ibuki was there.

3196
02:10:15,031 --> 02:10:18,401
I got the chills here.

3197
02:10:18,471 --> 02:10:19,901
She's coming.

3198
02:10:22,201 --> 02:10:23,201
Lip J.

3199
02:10:24,801 --> 02:10:29,011
The most memorable battle so far...

3200
02:10:29,611 --> 02:10:31,041
was the one with Lip J.

3201
02:10:33,151 --> 02:10:34,851
I can never forget that day.

3202
02:10:35,681 --> 02:10:38,391
(10 years ago, October 16, 2014, C'est La Waack in Taiwan)

3203
02:10:40,651 --> 02:10:44,121
Ibuki's name was known, and Lip J's wasn't.

3204
02:10:44,461 --> 02:10:47,431
I wanted to battle with Ibuki.

3205
02:10:47,531 --> 02:10:49,260
So if someone said Ibuki would be in some battle,

3206
02:10:49,261 --> 02:10:51,161
I would apply to participate in it.

3207
02:10:51,261 --> 02:10:53,230
I would participate in battles in Japan.

3208
02:10:53,231 --> 02:10:54,431
I followed her to battle with her.

3209
02:10:54,701 --> 02:10:55,971
She got caught.

3210
02:10:56,171 --> 02:10:59,571
"When else would I see you? I finally got to meet you."

3211
02:10:59,911 --> 02:11:03,211
Since I'm a world-famous waacking dancer,

3212
02:11:03,311 --> 02:11:04,681
I won't lose.

3213
02:11:04,941 --> 02:11:07,711
It was like a fight between water and fire.

3214
02:11:07,911 --> 02:11:11,581
Back then, I was powerful, powerful human, and the power queen.

3215
02:11:11,891 --> 02:11:15,290
I had a soft and delicate waacking style back then.

3216
02:11:15,291 --> 02:11:17,690
Ibuki was very hot and passionate.

3217
02:11:17,691 --> 02:11:20,960
She danced with a fast speed and precise tension.

3218
02:11:20,961 --> 02:11:23,531
Lip J had more curvy moves.

3219
02:11:23,631 --> 02:11:25,370
She was like a fish in water.

3220
02:11:25,371 --> 02:11:28,231
You'd think fire would win in that situation.

3221
02:11:30,301 --> 02:11:32,441
(The result was a tie.)

3222
02:11:32,841 --> 02:11:34,711
It kept being a tie.

3223
02:11:35,181 --> 02:11:36,480
Ibuki was Ibuki.

3224
02:11:36,481 --> 02:11:39,351
The battle was hard.

3225
02:11:39,881 --> 02:11:43,480
I've never lost in Korean battles.

3226
02:11:43,481 --> 02:11:44,981
You can't beat me.

3227
02:11:45,491 --> 02:11:47,691
(The battle went on to Round 3.)

3228
02:11:48,361 --> 02:11:50,091
(Lip J won in the battle against Ibuki.)

3229
02:11:50,461 --> 02:11:53,531
I felt really thrilled when I won against Ibuki.

3230
02:11:54,261 --> 02:11:58,001
(At the time the crew line up was revealed)

3231
02:11:59,101 --> 02:12:02,271
(I'm mad!)

3232
02:12:03,241 --> 02:12:05,241
(Screaming)

3233
02:12:06,611 --> 02:12:08,841
I've been waiting...

3234
02:12:09,681 --> 02:12:10,841
for the revenge day.

3235
02:12:12,751 --> 02:12:14,281
I've been waiting for this day only.

3236
02:12:16,451 --> 02:12:19,590
If I get a chance to battle against Lip J again,

3237
02:12:19,591 --> 02:12:21,221
I will definitely win that time.

3238
02:12:21,991 --> 02:12:24,961
The dancer I can beat...

3239
02:12:25,761 --> 02:12:27,491
(Bring it on.)

3240
02:12:28,091 --> 02:12:29,501
I've been waiting for it too.

3241
02:12:30,031 --> 02:12:31,231
Team Korea.

3242
02:12:31,831 --> 02:12:36,101
BUMSUP's Lip J.

3243
02:12:36,641 --> 02:12:38,341
Thank you, sister.

3244
02:12:39,611 --> 02:12:40,841
Let's go!

3245
02:12:41,241 --> 02:12:42,311
Mother.

3246
02:12:42,911 --> 02:12:45,211
Goodness!

3247
02:12:45,311 --> 02:12:46,680
They fought ten years ago.

3248
02:12:46,681 --> 02:12:48,720
She was well known, and she was a newcomer,

3249
02:12:48,721 --> 02:12:49,781
and she beat her.

3250
02:12:50,221 --> 02:12:52,090
- Rematch.
- It was the biggest offset.

3251
02:12:52,091 --> 02:12:53,120
- Rematch?
- Rematch.

3252
02:12:53,121 --> 02:12:54,720
Right.

3253
02:12:54,721 --> 02:12:56,760
It's happening in real life.

3254
02:12:56,761 --> 02:12:58,791
Let's go!

3255
02:12:58,991 --> 02:13:01,291
It's a given. Lip J would win.

3256
02:13:01,491 --> 02:13:04,561
Lip J would win this time as well.

3257
02:13:04,901 --> 02:13:06,431
Let's go!

3258
02:13:07,701 --> 02:13:09,141
I think we'll win this battle.

3259
02:13:12,041 --> 02:13:15,711
Let's go!

3260
02:13:17,041 --> 02:13:18,341
- Do what you always do.
- Okay.

3261
02:13:18,451 --> 02:13:20,011
What you always do. Have fun.

3262
02:13:21,251 --> 02:13:22,820
She would have been hungry.

3263
02:13:22,821 --> 02:13:24,351
She had no opponent.

3264
02:13:24,751 --> 02:13:26,421
I've been very hungry as well.

3265
02:13:26,851 --> 02:13:28,720
Lip J is someone...

3266
02:13:28,721 --> 02:13:31,321
I really want to prove that I can beat.

3267
02:13:31,791 --> 02:13:33,161
I'll do anything to beat her.

3268
02:13:33,661 --> 02:13:35,331
Team Japan's Ibuki...

3269
02:13:35,531 --> 02:13:37,001
versus Team Korea's Lip J.

3270
02:13:37,261 --> 02:13:40,101
The battle of the two dancers will begin!

3271
02:13:40,471 --> 02:13:42,201
Ready, fight!

3272
02:13:42,971 --> 02:13:44,701
(Ibuki will go first.)

3273
02:13:45,341 --> 02:13:46,341
Show me.

3274
02:13:46,871 --> 02:13:50,111
My whole body was burning.

3275
02:13:50,411 --> 02:13:51,511
Tear it up!

3276
02:13:53,011 --> 02:13:54,981
When I heard the song, I knew it was mine.

3277
02:13:55,181 --> 02:13:56,781
I thought I should show them my style.

3278
02:14:00,491 --> 02:14:01,491
Let's go!

3279
02:14:01,921 --> 02:14:03,861
Her moves were what I expected.

3280
02:14:07,961 --> 02:14:09,061
Okay!

3281
02:14:09,461 --> 02:14:10,731
She's like a legend.

3282
02:14:13,001 --> 02:14:16,601
My dance quality is better than Lip J's.

3283
02:14:19,841 --> 02:14:20,841
(Feeling thrilled)

3284
02:14:22,441 --> 02:14:23,881
Energy. I acknowledge that.

3285
02:14:28,721 --> 02:14:29,721
Nice!

3286
02:14:30,821 --> 02:14:31,821
Nice!

3287
02:14:32,021 --> 02:14:33,051
(Focusing)

3288
02:14:33,351 --> 02:14:34,491
(This is crazy.)

3289
02:14:35,421 --> 02:14:36,761
It was a real battle mode.

3290
02:14:39,161 --> 02:14:40,161
What's this?

3291
02:14:45,671 --> 02:14:47,201
Okay. Let me start.

3292
02:14:52,711 --> 02:14:54,911
(It's captivating.)

3293
02:14:58,011 --> 02:14:59,181
Nice.

3294
02:15:02,121 --> 02:15:03,480
That's Ibuki.

3295
02:15:03,481 --> 02:15:04,481
It was doable.

3296
02:15:06,921 --> 02:15:09,021
Countdown. Five, four,

3297
02:15:09,321 --> 02:15:12,030
three, two, one.

3298
02:15:12,031 --> 02:15:13,891
Switch. BUMSUP's Lip J!

3299
02:15:14,491 --> 02:15:15,530
(Well done!)

3300
02:15:15,531 --> 02:15:17,131
Ibuki!

3301
02:15:17,231 --> 02:15:18,930
Two, one.

3302
02:15:18,931 --> 02:15:20,731
Switch. BUMSUP's Lip J!

3303
02:15:21,701 --> 02:15:23,141
"You're a bit nervous as well."

3304
02:15:23,241 --> 02:15:24,341
"I'll beat you."

3305
02:15:25,611 --> 02:15:26,611
Let's go!

3306
02:15:26,612 --> 02:15:28,141
Listen to the music slowly.

3307
02:15:28,241 --> 02:15:31,440
Lip J is the only one who boils my passion for battle.

3308
02:15:31,441 --> 02:15:32,611
Come on, Korea.

3309
02:15:35,521 --> 02:15:37,221
I'm the best when it comes to waacking.

3310
02:15:38,121 --> 02:15:39,121
This is interesting.

3311
02:15:42,921 --> 02:15:43,991
Yes!

3312
02:15:44,191 --> 02:15:45,261
Yes!

3313
02:15:45,961 --> 02:15:46,961
Hello, sister.

3314
02:15:47,091 --> 02:15:48,931
Long time no see, Lip J.

3315
02:15:49,131 --> 02:15:50,961
- Crazy.
- Seriously.

3316
02:15:52,001 --> 02:15:53,771
I should have some fun.

3317
02:15:56,501 --> 02:15:59,041
Show it to me, Korea!

3318
02:15:59,611 --> 02:16:00,611
Let's go!

3319
02:16:05,181 --> 02:16:06,350
(That's right!)

3320
02:16:06,351 --> 02:16:07,681
(Feeling thrilled)

3321
02:16:09,021 --> 02:16:11,221
I should show them waacking properly.

3322
02:16:11,581 --> 02:16:14,221
Her skills were amazing.

3323
02:16:16,761 --> 02:16:17,761
Let's go.

3324
02:16:18,461 --> 02:16:20,430
(Are you ready?)

3325
02:16:20,431 --> 02:16:22,231
Okay!

3326
02:16:22,501 --> 02:16:23,501
Let's go.

3327
02:16:27,801 --> 02:16:28,871
(Shaking)

3328
02:16:36,811 --> 02:16:37,880
(She nailed it.)

3329
02:16:37,881 --> 02:16:38,881
Yes!

3330
02:16:38,881 --> 02:16:39,881
(It's a brilliant move.)

3331
02:16:39,882 --> 02:16:41,351
She knows the song.

3332
02:16:41,451 --> 02:16:42,781
That was Lip J.

3333
02:16:46,091 --> 02:16:47,891
That was fire. Oh, my gosh.

3334
02:16:48,591 --> 02:16:50,321
I was excited. It was fun.

3335
02:16:52,631 --> 02:16:54,791
Countdown. Five, four,

3336
02:16:55,261 --> 02:16:57,930
three, two, one.

3337
02:16:57,931 --> 02:17:00,000
Battle over.

3338
02:17:00,001 --> 02:17:03,440
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

3339
02:17:03,441 --> 02:17:05,041
It's crazy!

3340
02:17:06,171 --> 02:17:07,341
(Shaking in joy)

3341
02:17:08,241 --> 02:17:09,840
It's nice.

3342
02:17:09,841 --> 02:17:12,011
I want to keep watching.

3343
02:17:12,851 --> 02:17:14,811
- This...
- No!

3344
02:17:15,521 --> 02:17:16,521
It's a problem.

3345
02:17:17,081 --> 02:17:18,281
(Wriggling in thought)

3346
02:17:19,021 --> 02:17:20,921
I don't even know.

3347
02:17:21,391 --> 02:17:22,520
She's a national dancer.

3348
02:17:22,521 --> 02:17:24,861
She's elegant. She can't be more elegant.

3349
02:17:25,061 --> 02:17:26,430
They brought the heat up.

3350
02:17:26,431 --> 02:17:27,631
It's no joke.

3351
02:17:28,491 --> 02:17:30,330
They're different.

3352
02:17:30,331 --> 02:17:33,471
I feel like Ibuki gave energy,

3353
02:17:33,671 --> 02:17:34,901
and she gave a story.

3354
02:17:36,241 --> 02:17:37,641
That's close.

3355
02:17:38,541 --> 02:17:40,741
I want another one.

3356
02:17:40,941 --> 02:17:42,911
- Tied. Go again.
- Again.

3357
02:17:44,341 --> 02:17:46,251
Okay. Sorry.

3358
02:17:46,511 --> 02:17:48,611
We can't decide.

3359
02:17:49,751 --> 02:17:51,151
Can we see another round?

3360
02:17:51,421 --> 02:17:52,691
Yes.

3361
02:17:52,991 --> 02:17:54,450
Go!

3362
02:17:54,451 --> 02:17:56,920
(They're up for a rematch.)

3363
02:17:56,921 --> 02:17:58,461
We can't decide!

3364
02:17:59,131 --> 02:18:00,131
Water.

3365
02:18:00,891 --> 02:18:04,001
(The crew members are all supportive.)

3366
02:18:04,531 --> 02:18:05,531
Let's go.

3367
02:18:07,631 --> 02:18:09,440
Listen to the music.

3368
02:18:09,441 --> 02:18:10,801
You can do it after you listen to the music.

3369
02:18:11,301 --> 02:18:13,010
I can do it 1, 2, or 3 times.

3370
02:18:13,011 --> 02:18:14,011
However many times we can.

3371
02:18:14,441 --> 02:18:15,611
I knew it would be a tie.

3372
02:18:15,711 --> 02:18:16,941
Right. I can show them one more time.

3373
02:18:17,411 --> 02:18:20,281
Please prepare for the battle.

3374
02:18:24,621 --> 02:18:25,991
They're making a moment.

3375
02:18:26,351 --> 02:18:27,520
In the whole world,

3376
02:18:27,521 --> 02:18:28,691
In the whole world,

3377
02:18:28,791 --> 02:18:30,591
- I'm the best.
- I'm the best.

3378
02:18:30,691 --> 02:18:32,191
- in waacking.
- in waacking.

3379
02:18:32,531 --> 02:18:35,161
The battle of the two dancers will begin!

3380
02:18:35,601 --> 02:18:36,800
(Japan's waacking queen...)

3381
02:18:36,801 --> 02:18:37,801
(versus Korea's waacking queen)

3382
02:18:37,802 --> 02:18:39,971
Ready? Fight!

3383
02:18:47,171 --> 02:18:50,041
The two dancers should get ready for the battle.

3384
02:18:54,481 --> 02:18:55,781
They're making a moment.

3385
02:18:56,181 --> 02:18:58,450
- In the entire world, - In the entire world,

3386
02:18:58,451 --> 02:19:00,350
- regarding waacking, - regarding waacking,

3387
02:19:00,351 --> 02:19:01,921
- I'm the best.
- I'm the best.

3388
02:19:02,261 --> 02:19:04,961
The battle of the two dancers will begin.

3389
02:19:05,361 --> 02:19:06,460
(Japanese waacking queen...)

3390
02:19:06,461 --> 02:19:07,461
(versus Korean waacking queen)

3391
02:19:07,561 --> 02:19:09,631
Ready? Fight!

3392
02:19:12,731 --> 02:19:13,731
(I can't watch it sitting on a chair.)

3393
02:19:16,571 --> 02:19:17,571
Here we go.

3394
02:19:19,011 --> 02:19:20,341
Are you ready, Sister?

3395
02:19:20,741 --> 02:19:22,211
I will win, no matter what.

3396
02:19:22,841 --> 02:19:25,141
Don't move your body yet. Listen to the music.

3397
02:19:34,221 --> 02:19:35,221
Yes!

3398
02:19:35,222 --> 02:19:36,661
(Everyone stands up.)

3399
02:19:39,091 --> 02:19:40,261
(This is it.)

3400
02:19:41,891 --> 02:19:43,831
I can't believe this!

3401
02:19:46,171 --> 02:19:47,801
Slay it! Here we go!

3402
02:19:51,501 --> 02:19:52,841
Oh, my gosh!

3403
02:19:53,341 --> 02:19:54,371
(His heart races.)

3404
02:19:56,041 --> 02:19:57,811
- They're all beating.
- Yes.

3405
02:19:58,341 --> 02:19:59,751
I will win for sure.

3406
02:19:59,951 --> 02:20:01,210
I will win today, no matter what.

3407
02:20:01,211 --> 02:20:02,621
Go for it!

3408
02:20:06,251 --> 02:20:07,251
(Amazed)

3409
02:20:07,491 --> 02:20:08,621
(Eyes fixed)

3410
02:20:09,291 --> 02:20:10,891
That's crazy. Come on.

3411
02:20:11,461 --> 02:20:12,461
Here we go!

3412
02:20:12,561 --> 02:20:13,561
(Standing up automatically)

3413
02:20:13,561 --> 02:20:14,561
(Getting goosebumps)

3414
02:20:14,861 --> 02:20:15,861
(Exclaiming)

3415
02:20:18,161 --> 02:20:19,171
Let's go!

3416
02:20:19,871 --> 02:20:21,371
(Dashing)

3417
02:20:23,401 --> 02:20:24,401
(Here they come.)

3418
02:20:24,441 --> 02:20:25,441
Come on!

3419
02:20:28,111 --> 02:20:31,181
Give that!

3420
02:20:31,911 --> 02:20:32,911
(Jumping)

3421
02:20:33,111 --> 02:20:35,480
Give that!

3422
02:20:35,481 --> 02:20:36,850
Go, go! Keep going!

3423
02:20:36,851 --> 02:20:38,021
Go!

3424
02:20:39,221 --> 02:20:41,921
Give that!

3425
02:20:43,091 --> 02:20:44,421
(Seizing the judges' seats)

3426
02:20:48,361 --> 02:20:50,601
Please. Give it to me!

3427
02:20:53,371 --> 02:20:54,571
Oh, my goodness.

3428
02:20:56,301 --> 02:20:57,671
(Startled)

3429
02:21:00,011 --> 02:21:01,571
Ibuki just flew.

3430
02:21:02,071 --> 02:21:04,881
Count down. In 5, 4,

3431
02:21:04,981 --> 02:21:08,551
three, two, one.

3432
02:21:08,751 --> 02:21:11,080
Battle over.

3433
02:21:11,081 --> 02:21:12,951
(Watch the full version on "The CHOOM.")

3434
02:21:13,391 --> 02:21:14,490
(They rocked the stage.)

3435
02:21:14,491 --> 02:21:16,421
Oh, my gosh!

3436
02:21:16,891 --> 02:21:18,891
(Dizzy)

3437
02:21:19,431 --> 02:21:20,691
Oh, my gosh.

3438
02:21:22,091 --> 02:21:23,101
How does she know it?

3439
02:21:24,861 --> 02:21:26,131
It was so tough.

3440
02:21:27,371 --> 02:21:28,531
It was really tough.

3441
02:21:29,041 --> 02:21:30,041
Queens.

3442
02:21:30,042 --> 02:21:31,371
Seeing them live.

3443
02:21:31,971 --> 02:21:33,341
That's our leader.

3444
02:21:34,611 --> 02:21:36,510
This is our leader.

3445
02:21:36,511 --> 02:21:39,510
Let's go, Lip J. Let's go!

3446
02:21:39,511 --> 02:21:41,351
- That was like a show.
- Yes.

3447
02:21:41,951 --> 02:21:44,720
It was the jump-off stage for me.

3448
02:21:44,721 --> 02:21:45,721
She did this.

3449
02:21:45,722 --> 02:21:46,750
That was amazing.

3450
02:21:46,751 --> 02:21:48,620
I think they should be on a crew together.

3451
02:21:48,621 --> 02:21:50,721
Give them both the points.

3452
02:21:51,061 --> 02:21:53,290
- It's tough.
- It will be hard for the judges.

3453
02:21:53,291 --> 02:21:54,360
Gosh.

3454
02:21:54,361 --> 02:21:55,961
(The fight judges are in chaos.)

3455
02:21:56,161 --> 02:21:57,301
- No!
- It's a problem.

3456
02:21:57,701 --> 02:21:58,860
This is a problem.

3457
02:21:58,861 --> 02:22:00,331
I still don't know.

3458
02:22:01,901 --> 02:22:04,141
(Getting a headache)

3459
02:22:04,171 --> 02:22:07,270
I feel Japan has more control.

3460
02:22:07,271 --> 02:22:09,641
Team Korea is hopeful, but...

3461
02:22:10,211 --> 02:22:12,350
She just danced,

3462
02:22:12,351 --> 02:22:13,851
but the other girl was dancing to win.

3463
02:22:13,951 --> 02:22:15,951
She just danced.

3464
02:22:16,321 --> 02:22:18,320
Fight judge Park Jin Young,

3465
02:22:18,321 --> 02:22:20,251
what do you think about the battle?

3466
02:22:20,491 --> 02:22:21,790
First, I loved it.

3467
02:22:21,791 --> 02:22:22,861
(Grinning)

3468
02:22:23,491 --> 02:22:24,491
Thank you.

3469
02:22:24,492 --> 02:22:26,390
This is why I decided to do this.

3470
02:22:26,391 --> 02:22:27,631
For this type of stage.

3471
02:22:28,461 --> 02:22:30,200
(Proud)

3472
02:22:30,201 --> 02:22:34,001
I just want to say, I hope everyone watching at home knows...

3473
02:22:34,101 --> 02:22:38,200
they're lucky to have this battle on this show.

3474
02:22:38,201 --> 02:22:42,240
This is top, world champions on both sides.

3475
02:22:42,241 --> 02:22:45,581
Everyone needs to know the level of artistry...

3476
02:22:45,681 --> 02:22:47,710
that's happening right now because of the show.

3477
02:22:47,711 --> 02:22:50,980
I feel like this is just two different masters.

3478
02:22:50,981 --> 02:22:52,751
I feel like it's fire and water.

3479
02:22:53,021 --> 02:22:54,790
And it's really just, whoever's day it is,

3480
02:22:54,791 --> 02:22:56,161
and I do feel like today.

3481
02:22:56,291 --> 02:22:59,490
I think both of your skill level is right there.

3482
02:22:59,491 --> 02:23:01,660
There's not a doubt why you guys are both here...

3483
02:23:01,661 --> 02:23:02,960
representing the waackers.

3484
02:23:02,961 --> 02:23:05,430
- Who do you think?
- Lip J.

3485
02:23:05,431 --> 02:23:07,301
I feel like Ibuki may take it.

3486
02:23:08,271 --> 02:23:11,671
The two foreign judges look a bit cold, I might say.

3487
02:23:11,871 --> 02:23:13,611
They look like they can't decide.

3488
02:23:15,041 --> 02:23:16,881
They really can't decide. I can read it.

3489
02:23:17,041 --> 02:23:19,111
Would they be able to choose one?

3490
02:23:19,511 --> 02:23:21,380
The three fight judges...

3491
02:23:21,381 --> 02:23:24,681
need to open their cards at the same time.

3492
02:23:25,651 --> 02:23:28,620
From our perspective, Lip J has already won for sure.

3493
02:23:28,621 --> 02:23:32,991
I'm sorry, but Ibuki would never lose in a battle.

3494
02:23:33,261 --> 02:23:34,261
Card...

3495
02:23:35,261 --> 02:23:37,960
I'm a dancer with excellent skills.

3496
02:23:37,961 --> 02:23:40,230
I think I will win 100 percent.

3497
02:23:40,231 --> 02:23:42,100
Considering the performance quality...

3498
02:23:42,101 --> 02:23:43,300
and the stage presence,

3499
02:23:43,301 --> 02:23:45,600
my dance was more overwhelming in many ways.

3500
02:23:45,601 --> 02:23:47,271
I showed a perfomance good enough to win.

3501
02:23:47,941 --> 02:23:49,511
Card open.

3502
02:23:50,281 --> 02:23:53,311
(What's the result of the rematch between Ibuki and Lip J?)

3503
02:23:53,481 --> 02:23:55,011
Card open.

3504
02:23:56,721 --> 02:23:58,220
(0 versus 3)

3505
02:23:58,221 --> 02:23:59,391
(Lip J wins!)

3506
02:23:59,821 --> 02:24:01,891
(Shouting for joy)

3507
02:24:02,151 --> 02:24:04,361
(Feeling sorry)

3508
02:24:04,591 --> 02:24:06,791
I still think they both did very well.

3509
02:24:07,161 --> 02:24:08,161
Ibuki,

3510
02:24:08,661 --> 02:24:10,901
you danced better than Lip J.

3511
02:24:11,231 --> 02:24:15,431
(Ibuki filled the stage with her splendid dance skills.)

3512
02:24:16,041 --> 02:24:17,241
But Lip J,

3513
02:24:17,501 --> 02:24:19,911
you made it more like a performance.

3514
02:24:20,071 --> 02:24:23,741
(Lip J caught everyone's attention with her unequaled stage presence.)

3515
02:24:24,181 --> 02:24:26,981
Lip J gave me a better performance.

3516
02:24:27,851 --> 02:24:31,650
Lip J, you had something that felt a little bit more relatable...

3517
02:24:31,651 --> 02:24:33,120
that I could connect you.

3518
02:24:33,121 --> 02:24:35,990
And I feel like... But that doesn't take anything away from you, Ibuki.

3519
02:24:35,991 --> 02:24:38,290
You're a beast.

3520
02:24:38,291 --> 02:24:39,890
Everyone in the room knows it.

3521
02:24:39,891 --> 02:24:43,200
Everyone knows this is a really tough battle to judge.

3522
02:24:43,201 --> 02:24:44,201
Respects.

3523
02:24:45,901 --> 02:24:49,541
Team Korea, Lip J of BUMSUP wins.

3524
02:24:51,241 --> 02:24:53,771
- That was so...
- BUMSUP won.

3525
02:24:54,841 --> 02:24:56,810
- Come here.
- This is insane.

3526
02:24:56,811 --> 02:24:58,140
Come here.

3527
02:24:58,141 --> 02:24:59,150
Come here.

3528
02:24:59,151 --> 02:25:01,481
(It's like a festival.)

3529
02:25:01,611 --> 02:25:02,621
Let's go!

3530
02:25:03,181 --> 02:25:06,920
(Happy BUMSUP)

3531
02:25:06,921 --> 02:25:09,621
(Excited)

3532
02:25:09,821 --> 02:25:10,821
(Good)

3533
02:25:11,091 --> 02:25:12,391
Can't touch us!

3534
02:25:13,191 --> 02:25:14,191
I'm sorry.

3535
02:25:15,461 --> 02:25:16,461
Sorry.

3536
02:25:16,462 --> 02:25:17,561
(OSAKA Ojo Gang heartily welcomes Ibuki who did her best as a leader.)

3537
02:25:18,231 --> 02:25:19,671
I will pay it back, for sure.

3538
02:25:21,201 --> 02:25:22,770
(Admitting the result)

3539
02:25:22,771 --> 02:25:25,140
After our 1st battle, 10 years have passed.

3540
02:25:25,141 --> 02:25:27,710
It was a chance to find my first resolution.

3541
02:25:27,711 --> 02:25:30,010
A top-level battle like that...

3542
02:25:30,011 --> 02:25:33,650
is hard to have underground.

3543
02:25:33,651 --> 02:25:37,481
Being able to have it on a big stage like WSWF...

3544
02:25:37,851 --> 02:25:40,491
and have many people to watch it...

3545
02:25:40,991 --> 02:25:42,490
That was meaningful to me,

3546
02:25:42,491 --> 02:25:43,961
and I guess it was the same for her.

3547
02:25:44,061 --> 02:25:46,491
We made excellent moves together.

3548
02:25:48,761 --> 02:25:49,761
Let's have a battle one more time later.

3549
02:25:50,531 --> 02:25:51,531
All right.

3550
02:25:53,071 --> 02:25:56,171
(Win or lose, they showed the best performance.)

3551
02:25:56,801 --> 02:26:00,241
(They met again as a colleague and rival. The intense battle ends.)

3552
02:26:00,511 --> 02:26:01,710
(Relay Team Battle begins right away.)

3553
02:26:01,711 --> 02:26:03,740
(The double score system is game-changing.)

3554
02:26:03,741 --> 02:26:04,840
(It's a gamble.)

3555
02:26:04,841 --> 02:26:05,950
(We're in big trouble if we lose.)

3556
02:26:05,951 --> 02:26:07,550
(I thought she was punching.)

3557
02:26:07,551 --> 02:26:09,080
(It was really scary.)

3558
02:26:09,081 --> 02:26:10,081
(This is crazy.)

3559
02:26:10,082 --> 02:26:11,280
(It made me mad.)

3560
02:26:11,281 --> 02:26:13,621
(She's doing a lot, like fish.)

3561
02:26:13,651 --> 02:26:15,051
(They underestimate us.)

3562
02:26:15,251 --> 02:26:17,120
(RHTokyo crew, please come out.)

3563
02:26:17,121 --> 02:26:18,820
(She wants to decide the representative of Japan.)

3564
02:26:18,821 --> 02:26:21,031
(Anyone can tell that we're on a different level.)

3565
02:26:21,691 --> 02:26:22,730
(They're the strongest team.)

3566
02:26:22,731 --> 02:26:23,731
(She ate that.)

3567
02:26:23,732 --> 02:26:25,661
(This will be a sick battle.)

3568
02:26:25,861 --> 02:26:27,630
(The crew in the 1st place exclaims.)

3569
02:26:27,631 --> 02:26:28,830
I'll go first.

3570
02:26:28,831 --> 02:26:29,841
(Running fast)

3571
02:26:30,071 --> 02:26:31,400
Whenever they say ROYAL FAMILY,

3572
02:26:31,401 --> 02:26:32,710
I think they mean us.

3573
02:26:32,711 --> 02:26:33,811
It's annoying.

3574
02:26:34,011 --> 02:26:35,410
We seriously need to slay it.

3575
02:26:35,411 --> 02:26:37,241
I'm so angry. I can't stand it.

3576
02:26:37,881 --> 02:26:40,211
- We're doing great!
- That was so much fun!

3577
02:26:40,851 --> 02:26:42,621
Good job, girls.

3578
02:26:43,081 --> 02:26:45,150
Hurray! Tied for first place!

3579
02:26:45,151 --> 02:26:47,250
When they put us sixth.

3580
02:26:47,251 --> 02:26:48,651
Eliminated first? Who?

3581
02:26:48,751 --> 02:26:51,590
What I'm thinking is, you all put us sixth, and...

3582
02:26:51,591 --> 02:26:52,860
And would you look at that?

3583
02:26:52,861 --> 02:26:55,330
They keep making eye contact with people.

3584
02:26:55,331 --> 02:26:57,301
Kyra keeps looking at me.

3585
02:26:57,861 --> 02:26:59,731
I just can't look at the Australian team.

3586
02:27:00,701 --> 02:27:02,100
If I had to, who do you want to pick?

3587
02:27:02,101 --> 02:27:03,800
(Meanwhile, AG SQUAD is duscussing the team battle.)

3588
02:27:03,801 --> 02:27:04,840
(Thinking)

3589
02:27:04,841 --> 02:27:05,970
ROYAL FAMILY?

3590
02:27:05,971 --> 02:27:07,871
I think ROYAL FAMILY, to redeem our loss.

3591
02:27:07,971 --> 02:27:09,981
We know what they're going to come with, you know.

3592
02:27:10,741 --> 02:27:11,741
(They're going to do this.)

3593
02:27:11,742 --> 02:27:13,010
It's all this.

3594
02:27:13,011 --> 02:27:14,351
They do this every time.

3595
02:27:14,751 --> 02:27:16,221
Lame.

3596
02:27:16,481 --> 02:27:19,790
How intimidating would it be if we took the piece out of it?

3597
02:27:19,791 --> 02:27:22,191
I just know that we're stronger than that.

3598
02:27:22,351 --> 02:27:24,090
We'll show them with our dancing.

3599
02:27:24,091 --> 02:27:25,591
We're going to mess it up.

3600
02:27:25,991 --> 02:27:29,090
Thank you for your work, once again.

3601
02:27:29,091 --> 02:27:30,460
I thought it was a natural result.

3602
02:27:30,461 --> 02:27:31,931
It was a result I expected.

3603
02:27:32,101 --> 02:27:34,230
(In the first half, they showed their competence for battles.)

3604
02:27:34,231 --> 02:27:36,670
(RHTokyo took victory.)

3605
02:27:36,671 --> 02:27:37,701
See?

3606
02:27:37,801 --> 02:27:40,171
I told you we're not going to lose.

3607
02:27:40,271 --> 02:27:42,311
By the way, I tried my best.

3608
02:27:42,711 --> 02:27:44,810
(In the battle against Kyoka of OSAKA Ojo Gang,)

3609
02:27:44,811 --> 02:27:46,910
(Rie Hata won.)

3610
02:27:46,911 --> 02:27:50,321
(Rie Hata, the leader showed RHTokyo's strength.)

3611
02:27:50,421 --> 02:27:52,220
- You were great.
- You were awesome.

3612
02:27:52,221 --> 02:27:54,251
Kyoka must be feeling furious.

3613
02:27:54,451 --> 02:27:58,490
(OSAKA Ojo Gang's hideout)

3614
02:27:58,491 --> 02:28:00,090
Gosh, I want to kill her.

3615
02:28:00,091 --> 02:28:01,260
I felt furious.

3616
02:28:01,261 --> 02:28:02,701
It felt so bad.

3617
02:28:03,431 --> 02:28:05,061
How can we all lose? It's nonsense.

3618
02:28:05,531 --> 02:28:09,301
(OSAKA Ojo Gang showed a poor performance, 1 win and 3 losses.)

3619
02:28:09,501 --> 02:28:11,071
It's 1 win and 3 losses?

3620
02:28:11,271 --> 02:28:12,371
It doesn't make sense.

3621
02:28:12,741 --> 02:28:14,670
Our crew is strong at battles,

3622
02:28:14,671 --> 02:28:16,681
and now we're losing battles.

3623
02:28:16,781 --> 02:28:18,310
This looks dangerous.

3624
02:28:18,311 --> 02:28:19,581
I just can't help making a bitter smile.

3625
02:28:20,181 --> 02:28:23,150
By the way, RHTokyo is winning with a free-style dance.

3626
02:28:23,151 --> 02:28:25,320
How can that happen?

3627
02:28:25,321 --> 02:28:27,091
It's totally out of the question.

3628
02:28:27,621 --> 02:28:29,590
Which crew should we pick for the team battle?

3629
02:28:29,591 --> 02:28:30,621
Kyoka probably...

3630
02:28:32,061 --> 02:28:33,231
choose Rie Hata?

3631
02:28:35,231 --> 02:28:36,901
- Should I?
- Yes.

3632
02:28:37,331 --> 02:28:39,931
I've been thinking, but I keep coming...

3633
02:28:40,971 --> 02:28:42,971
to the conclusion that it has to be RHTokyo.

3634
02:28:43,141 --> 02:28:45,501
- Who are you going to pick?
- Who should I pick?

3635
02:28:45,801 --> 02:28:48,340
How many times will I be chosen? I think it'll be 2 to 3 times.

3636
02:28:48,341 --> 02:28:50,640
Everyone calls me out.

3637
02:28:50,641 --> 02:28:52,910
Maybe Ibuki's OSAKA Ojo Gang?

3638
02:28:52,911 --> 02:28:54,910
She's daring.

3639
02:28:54,911 --> 02:28:56,850
- This is crazy.
- It is.

3640
02:28:56,851 --> 02:28:58,550
- What do we do?
- What do we do?

3641
02:28:58,551 --> 02:29:00,291
It wouldn't be fun if we won again.

3642
02:29:00,721 --> 02:29:04,090
(RHTokyo is going back to the fight zone.)

3643
02:29:04,091 --> 02:29:07,161
It's so annoying that we keep losing.

3644
02:29:09,631 --> 02:29:11,060
(OSAKA Ojo Gang arrives at the fight zone.)

3645
02:29:11,061 --> 02:29:12,831
(Glancing)

3646
02:29:12,931 --> 02:29:14,071
Did you see that?

3647
02:29:16,141 --> 02:29:17,501
Are they custom-made?

3648
02:29:17,641 --> 02:29:20,441
So, they have enough time to make those things.

3649
02:29:20,771 --> 02:29:21,841
They must have a lot of free time.

3650
02:29:22,811 --> 02:29:24,610
You've heard them say,

3651
02:29:24,611 --> 02:29:26,680
"Don't let Rie Hata overpower you," or "You're still learning."

3652
02:29:26,681 --> 02:29:28,580
I think it's time to show what you've got.

3653
02:29:28,581 --> 02:29:30,720
You need to show them you're leading this.

3654
02:29:30,721 --> 02:29:32,481
Don't mind me.

3655
02:29:33,051 --> 02:29:35,191
RHTokyo might pick us.

3656
02:29:35,821 --> 02:29:38,321
- Why? What makes you think so?
- I just have a feeling.

3657
02:29:38,761 --> 02:29:40,161
Then, we can fight against them.

3658
02:29:41,431 --> 02:29:43,861
I'm not scared of them at all.

3659
02:29:44,831 --> 02:29:46,531
Then, I'm going to beat you.

3660
02:29:48,071 --> 02:29:51,840
Now, we will begin the second half...

3661
02:29:51,841 --> 02:29:54,341
of the No Respect World Battle.

3662
02:29:56,541 --> 02:29:59,911
The first crew for the Relay Team Battle is...

3663
02:30:00,381 --> 02:30:01,450
I'm excited.

3664
02:30:01,451 --> 02:30:03,380
The fourth-ranked crew in the first half.

3665
02:30:03,381 --> 02:30:06,691
The team Japan, OSAKA Ojo Gang.

3666
02:30:08,951 --> 02:30:10,420
Are they in fourth place?

3667
02:30:10,421 --> 02:30:12,321
They look upset. They look really mad.

3668
02:30:12,761 --> 02:30:13,991
(I'm mad.)

3669
02:30:14,161 --> 02:30:18,061
I was expecting OSAKA Ojo Gang to dominate the battles, honestly.

3670
02:30:18,361 --> 02:30:19,931
(OSAKA Ojo Gang received the least number of No Respect.)

3671
02:30:20,271 --> 02:30:21,300
(I want to do a battle right now.)

3672
02:30:21,301 --> 02:30:22,370
(Fully confident)

3673
02:30:22,371 --> 02:30:24,271
But they lost.

3674
02:30:24,401 --> 02:30:26,470
I don't think I saw them win any of the battles.

3675
02:30:26,471 --> 02:30:28,111
I'm just so shocked.

3676
02:30:29,171 --> 02:30:30,841
(Before going to the fight zone)

3677
02:30:31,041 --> 02:30:33,151
We ranked second as the expected winner.

3678
02:30:34,411 --> 02:30:35,580
(Applause)

3679
02:30:35,581 --> 02:30:37,381
(Starting in a good mood with a high ranking)

3680
02:30:38,181 --> 02:30:40,051
(This is the Osaka class.)

3681
02:30:40,291 --> 02:30:42,650
I could tell other crews thought...

3682
02:30:42,651 --> 02:30:45,091
we were a strong crew.

3683
02:30:45,961 --> 02:30:48,730
When I entered the fight zone,

3684
02:30:48,731 --> 02:30:53,071
I believed this would be a place where we could show our best skills.

3685
02:30:54,931 --> 02:30:56,401
(But)

3686
02:30:56,701 --> 02:30:58,771
(Unexpectedly, they were on a losing streak.)

3687
02:30:59,141 --> 02:31:01,610
The strongest battle dancers in our crew...

3688
02:31:01,611 --> 02:31:03,611
are Ibuki and Kyoka.

3689
02:31:04,681 --> 02:31:07,011
When she and I lost,

3690
02:31:07,181 --> 02:31:08,481
I thought, "Would it be okay?"

3691
02:31:08,981 --> 02:31:10,381
- We're in trouble.
- We're in trouble.

3692
02:31:10,551 --> 02:31:11,921
(RHTokyo was thrilled to defeat OSAKA Ojo Gang.)

3693
02:31:12,151 --> 02:31:13,491
OSAKA Ojo Gang will be upset.

3694
02:31:14,421 --> 02:31:15,890
I want to kill them.

3695
02:31:15,891 --> 02:31:18,761
RHTokyo keeps winning all battles.

3696
02:31:19,691 --> 02:31:21,830
From top to toe,

3697
02:31:21,831 --> 02:31:23,061
I felt furious.

3698
02:31:24,231 --> 02:31:25,530
Who should we pick in the second half?

3699
02:31:25,531 --> 02:31:27,601
If we lose again, it'll be a double loss.

3700
02:31:28,231 --> 02:31:30,841
I've been thinking, but...

3701
02:31:32,271 --> 02:31:33,541
Probably Rie Hata?

3702
02:31:35,471 --> 02:31:36,541
Should I?

3703
02:31:39,581 --> 02:31:41,580
The crew that we, OSAKA Ojo Gang,

3704
02:31:41,581 --> 02:31:45,751
will deliver a double loss to is...

3705
02:31:50,661 --> 02:31:53,331
Team Japan.

3706
02:31:54,061 --> 02:31:55,360
RHTokyo!

3707
02:31:55,361 --> 02:31:56,701
(We're waiting for this.)

3708
02:31:57,431 --> 02:31:59,031
Japan versus Japan.

3709
02:31:59,631 --> 02:32:01,431
I knew that.

3710
02:32:02,701 --> 02:32:04,001
I have goosebumps.

3711
02:32:05,571 --> 02:32:07,771
RHTokyo. We're looking forward to this.

3712
02:32:08,871 --> 02:32:11,041
(Yes. We're ready to beat you.)

3713
02:32:11,441 --> 02:32:12,681
It was fun.

3714
02:32:13,111 --> 02:32:14,350
I actually appreciate...

3715
02:32:14,351 --> 02:32:16,081
that they chose us.

3716
02:32:16,281 --> 02:32:17,851
I'll beat them again.

3717
02:32:19,651 --> 02:32:20,851
I'll win this, no matter what.

3718
02:32:21,191 --> 02:32:23,321
This is a fun part of a real battle.

3719
02:32:23,491 --> 02:32:25,091
I was wondering if they thought they could win.

3720
02:32:25,291 --> 02:32:28,890
Each member of the OSAKA Ojo Gang is unique,

3721
02:32:28,891 --> 02:32:31,460
so I don't think they can bring out their best.

3722
02:32:31,461 --> 02:32:35,000
The teamwork at RHTokyo is great,

3723
02:32:35,001 --> 02:32:36,941
with all members trusting each other.

3724
02:32:37,171 --> 02:32:38,941
(RHTokyo looks confident after being together for long.)

3725
02:32:39,771 --> 02:32:40,911
Let's win, no matter what.

3726
02:32:42,011 --> 02:32:43,581
I wasn't sure if they were happy.

3727
02:32:44,181 --> 02:32:47,111
They looked excited like they wanted to fight for real.

3728
02:32:47,411 --> 02:32:50,421
We don't need two crews to represent Japan.

3729
02:32:50,551 --> 02:32:52,320
Who is representing Japan?

3730
02:32:52,321 --> 02:32:55,490
RHTokyo is representing Japan.

3731
02:32:55,491 --> 02:32:56,621
That's not true.

3732
02:32:57,421 --> 02:32:59,220
As an Osaka native, I can't forgive them.

3733
02:32:59,221 --> 02:33:00,960
Between Osaka and Tokyo,

3734
02:33:00,961 --> 02:33:03,160
which crew is stronger in dance?

3735
02:33:03,161 --> 02:33:05,331
This is a matter that Japan should also pay attention to.

3736
02:33:05,631 --> 02:33:07,170
We came here to win.

3737
02:33:07,171 --> 02:33:08,901
I'll do anything to win.

3738
02:33:09,231 --> 02:33:10,440
We're just bystanders.

3739
02:33:10,441 --> 02:33:11,770
It's fun to watch for us.

3740
02:33:11,771 --> 02:33:12,840
(So much fun)

3741
02:33:12,841 --> 02:33:15,441
Where's my popcorn? I need my popcorn.

3742
02:33:16,981 --> 02:33:20,580
Two crews that represent Japan will compete.

3743
02:33:20,581 --> 02:33:23,250
Finally, the real battle of Team Japan begins.

3744
02:33:23,251 --> 02:33:24,481
Drop the beat!

3745
02:33:24,781 --> 02:33:26,391
(Relay Team Battle starts!)

3746
02:33:29,291 --> 02:33:30,791
(Next week)

3747
02:33:30,961 --> 02:33:34,160
The next mission that will determine the country's fate.

3748
02:33:34,161 --> 02:33:35,961
(Class Mission)

3749
02:33:36,131 --> 02:33:37,730
(Class Mission, the signature of the series…)

3750
02:33:37,731 --> 02:33:39,360
(where legendary choreographies were born.)

3751
02:33:39,361 --> 02:33:41,371
Everyone has an incredible background.

3752
02:33:41,871 --> 02:33:43,170
(This is the real global game.)

3753
02:33:43,171 --> 02:33:47,170
I have so much history of being the main dancer in music videos.

3754
02:33:47,171 --> 02:33:48,711
(I was always the main dancer.)

3755
02:33:49,141 --> 02:33:50,980
I don't want to be a backup dancer.

3756
02:33:50,981 --> 02:33:53,351
I've never been a backup dancer.

3757
02:33:53,551 --> 02:33:56,210
She's been the main dancer all her life.

3758
02:33:56,211 --> 02:33:57,780
(The leader-class main dancer of Season 1)

3759
02:33:57,781 --> 02:33:59,421
(The rookie-class main dancer of Season 2)

3760
02:33:59,721 --> 02:34:01,420
(Choreography of Class Mission)

3761
02:34:01,421 --> 02:34:03,520
I've seen the choreography before.

3762
02:34:03,521 --> 02:34:05,020
It was quite clear...

3763
02:34:05,021 --> 02:34:06,661
that you stuck to their brand...

3764
02:34:07,361 --> 02:34:08,361
and...

3765
02:34:08,362 --> 02:34:09,800
didn't think about how we could...

3766
02:34:09,801 --> 02:34:11,560
utilize other styles.

3767
02:34:11,561 --> 02:34:13,770
The others just hated our dance.

3768
02:34:13,771 --> 02:34:15,570
I'm pissed about AG SQUAD.

3769
02:34:15,571 --> 02:34:19,240
Can you guys pick up BUMSUP's choreography in a day?

3770
02:34:19,241 --> 02:34:20,511
(Of course!)

3771
02:34:21,271 --> 02:34:22,870
It was just so annoying.

3772
02:34:22,871 --> 02:34:26,211
AG SQUAD chose we're the worst choreography.

3773
02:34:26,751 --> 02:34:27,980
(I'm going crazy.)

3774
02:34:27,981 --> 02:34:29,280
(I don't care at all.)

3775
02:34:29,281 --> 02:34:30,850
Whoever has an issue,

3776
02:34:30,851 --> 02:34:33,291
bless their souls. Love you.

3777
02:34:33,721 --> 02:34:36,590
(This is war with AG SQUAD.)

3778
02:34:36,591 --> 02:34:39,830
That thing is that those girls will try to win.

3779
02:34:39,831 --> 02:34:42,160
They can't pull up choreography and a music video.

3780
02:34:42,161 --> 02:34:43,660
They'll just reuse the choreography.

3781
02:34:43,661 --> 02:34:45,501
- They'll use Parris Goebel's.
- No, I'm off.

3782
02:34:45,701 --> 02:34:47,600
The video that went viral was the one...

3783
02:34:47,601 --> 02:34:49,571
that they weren't in.

3784
02:34:49,741 --> 02:34:54,410
We'll do anything we can to be picked as the main dancers.

3785
02:34:54,411 --> 02:34:56,480
To get our revenge in a way.

3786
02:34:56,481 --> 02:34:58,011
I believe Aaliyah and I will win.

3787
02:34:59,281 --> 02:35:00,710
(But)

3788
02:35:00,711 --> 02:35:01,850
(They are doomed.)

3789
02:35:01,851 --> 02:35:02,851
(No way)

3790
02:35:02,852 --> 02:35:05,751
(Vanessa made a mistake in the Main Dancer Audition.)

3791
02:35:08,151 --> 02:35:10,690
Vanessa, did you miss a couple of choreographies?

3792
02:35:10,691 --> 02:35:12,260
(ROYAL FAMILY and AG SQUAD. What will be the result?)

3793
02:35:12,261 --> 02:35:16,190
Our rival for this mission is definitely Team Korea.

3794
02:35:16,191 --> 02:35:19,360
Team Korea can't lose this battle.

3795
02:35:19,361 --> 02:35:21,600
In season One, no:ze was picked as the main dancer,

3796
02:35:21,601 --> 02:35:23,700
and her choreography was selected.

3797
02:35:23,701 --> 02:35:25,900
Leejung is amazing at creating choreography.

3798
02:35:25,901 --> 02:35:27,010
For us, I think...

3799
02:35:27,011 --> 02:35:28,640
BUMSUP might just have choreography,

3800
02:35:28,641 --> 02:35:30,440
but there is nothing much more to it.

3801
02:35:30,441 --> 02:35:33,151
(BUMSUP is showing their choreography.)

3802
02:35:33,381 --> 02:35:34,880
It's easy.

3803
02:35:34,881 --> 02:35:37,051
I think anyone can beat them.

3804
02:35:37,251 --> 02:35:39,620
I think we do this to be the main dancer.

3805
02:35:39,621 --> 02:35:43,161
We can also outshine this, like crazy for sure.

3806
02:35:44,821 --> 02:35:46,890
My strategy is to do Honey J's choreography...

3807
02:35:46,891 --> 02:35:48,290
to be the main dancer.

3808
02:35:48,291 --> 02:35:50,030
It looks like it's easy to do.

3809
02:35:50,031 --> 02:35:51,100
- Who won?
- Because...

3810
02:35:51,101 --> 02:35:53,731
- Honey J's was easy.
- Okay.

3811
02:35:54,771 --> 02:35:56,540
They just want to steal it.

3812
02:35:56,541 --> 02:35:58,970
They teach you guys, and they're not going to win.

3813
02:35:58,971 --> 02:36:00,771
They're just going to lose.

3814
02:36:02,341 --> 02:36:04,310
They don't look good.

3815
02:36:04,311 --> 02:36:05,580
Don't they like us?

3816
02:36:05,581 --> 02:36:06,951
We can't let them take it.

3817
02:36:07,181 --> 02:36:08,810
We're the choreographers who made that.

3818
02:36:08,811 --> 02:36:11,420
We really do care about our choreography.

3819
02:36:11,421 --> 02:36:13,290
How can we let them have it?

3820
02:36:13,291 --> 02:36:15,051
We won't let anyone take it.

3821
02:36:15,951 --> 02:36:18,060
It'll be a shame if Team Korea isn't picked as the main dancer...

3822
02:36:18,061 --> 02:36:19,661
and their choreography is selected.

3823
02:36:19,891 --> 02:36:22,290
Team Korea must be shocked.

3824
02:36:22,291 --> 02:36:23,900
Everyone was going for Team Korea today.

3825
02:36:23,901 --> 02:36:26,331
I feel bad. They lost so badly.

3826
02:36:26,971 --> 02:36:28,971
(Who's at the top of the food chain?)

3827
02:36:29,612 --> 02:36:31,612
