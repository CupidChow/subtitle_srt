1
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,480

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,430

3
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:28,200

4
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,680

5
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,860

6
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:48,010

7
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,120

8
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,810

9
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,980
Tell me. Everything.

10
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,730
Say it, Dong Kyeong.

11
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,920
I want to live...

12
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,120
I really...

13
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,420
really, really want to live...

14
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,230
I...

15
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:56,750
With you, Seon Kyeong,

16
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,090
Aunt, and Unni,

17
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,380
with people I love,

18
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,160
really...

19
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:15,200
I really, really... really want to live.

20
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,820
I do too. Me too, Tak Dong Kyeong.

21
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,800
I want to stay alive.

22
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,390
And with you...

23
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,690
I want to die together.

24
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:30,080
When we were young, if Seon Kyeong asked me where our parents went, I told him they went to the sky.

25
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,100
But if he asked me why, I didn't know what to say.

26
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,130
So I would just sit here for hours.

27
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,590
After looking up for a long time, I understood.

28
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,320
They just went back to the place they came from.

29
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,940
We are all from the stars.

30
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,560
The energy that constitutes our bodies came from the stars.

31
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,390
So if we go back to the past,

32
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,000
we all started from the same place.

33
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,010
When we go back to that same place,

34
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,090
we will meet again.

35
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,730
We will never be separated from each other.

36
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:30,470
Hey, hey, hey! Bring Writer Lee Hyeon right now and make her apologize!

37
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,840
Where is Team Leader Cha?

38
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,270
Team Leader Cha?

39
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,640
Where did he go during his work hours?

40
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,820
He went out for work.

41
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,270
Contact him. Seriously!

42
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,800
Team Leader Cha, you seriously added fuel to the fire.

43
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,210
I had to stop that hyungnim because he insisted on getting plastic surgery.

44
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,890
- Why did you do that? 
 - Why did you–

45
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:55,400
Hey, without him, our company would go bankrupt!

46
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,250
If the company goes bankrupt because of one writer, then that company was destined to go bankrupt in the first place.

47
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,010
Hey!

48
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,350
I told you there's no "hey," "you," "him" here.

49
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,130
Anyway, bring Writer Lee Hyeon.

50
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,010
If she can't apologize, tell her to compensate for the laptop.

51
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,750
Just take that from my salary.

52
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,430
Your salary? How much is that small salary of yours?

53
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,520
At least you know it's small.

54
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,310
You must not take it seriously because you get a consistent salary while not doing much, but

55
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,980
try going outside.

56
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:31,700
There are so many kids who want to receive that small salary.

57
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,450
Anyway, kids these days have no loyalty.

58
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,380
Think of this as your company,

59
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,080
move as if it's your own work, and conserve money as if it's your own!

60
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,690
How can I think of this as my own company when it's not?

61
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,000
You'll never work out because you live with that mindset.

62
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,610
Team Leader Cha, don't you want to become like me?

63
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:56,660
Do you want to end your life while earning that small salary?

64
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,400
You're sighing?

65
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,560
- Seriously, you're so cheap that I can't handle it. 
 - What?

66
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,310
I don't think you are asking for the interpretation of the sentence "You're so cheap that I can't handle it".

67
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,360
I will quit, so take the price of the laptop out from my severance pay.

68
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,860
My goodness, how much do you even have in your severance pay?

69
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,250
Hey, I have lived ten years more than you,

70
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,790
but I've seen many people ruin their life over their pride.

71
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,820
You think other places will accept you since you were the team leader here, right?

72
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,380
Society is not that easy, you youngster.

73
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,350
You're really dragging out the sentence "I'm old" in such a long way.

74
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,390
Hey, Cha Joo Ik!

75
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,210
Are you seriously quitting? Where and how are you going to survive?

76
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,980
Seriously, you act as if your father is the owner of the building.

77
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,200
Huh? How did you know?

78
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:55,650
My father is the building owner. Of this place.

79
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,440
Unni was on a school trip then.

80
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,380
You know that hotel we saw on the way over here? That was the place they were staying.

81
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,380
I was working part-time to get some allowance for myself.

82
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,160
What kind of part-time job?

83
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,600
There's that. Something that allowed me to make some small memories during my teenage years.

84
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,140
I was making a lot back then.

85
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,100
I didn't see a person who climbed over the wall that coolly.

86
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,320
Unni told me she liked me then.

87
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,060
What did she like so much about you?

88
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,460
She said she liked me because I was cheerful.

89
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,690
Anyway, I got her contact information, then

90
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:36,180
I was contacting her and she told me to come to her.

91
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,510
But who am I? I just got accepted.

92
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,000
The food's here.

93
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,580
 Thank you.

94
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,300
It looks delicious. I'll eat well!

95
00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:00,030
♫  There are things I want to tell you  ♫

96
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:07,030
♫  When I see you, I think of one person  ♫

97
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,290
You're eating. Do you know how many times Tak Seon Kyeong's dream changed?

98
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,870
He said he'll do this one day, then another the next day.

99
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,700
But the funny thing is, he means it all.

100
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,580
I'm the only one suffering because of that sincerity.

101
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,150
Seriously, Tak Seon Kyeong always said he was going to the academy, and then he went to PC Room.

102
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,010
It was my job to go catch him.

103
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,530
Your family was always either chasing or getting chased as their job.

104
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,750
And the person who was chasing will always get caught.

105
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,860
You saw how my aunt grabbed my neck, right?

106
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,060
I always grabbed that bastard's ears.

107
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,280
Hello!

108
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:53,120
♫  You always change me  ♫

109
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,230
♫  I'm happy you're here  ♫

110
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,660
Why?

111
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,380
It's nothing.

112
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,560
When Aunt and Uncle were dating, they ran into Tak Seon Kyeong in a street like this.

113
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,660
Tak Seon Kyeong called me and was crying over how Aunt was taken away from him.

114
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,380
So do you know what I did first?

115
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,000
I found a job.

116
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,290
To send my aunt away for marriage, I thought that I had to earn money quickly.

117
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,790
I went up quickly and got a job at the publishing company,

118
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,330
but I never expected to be working there for this long.

119
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,080
How are your making money and your aunt getting married related?

120
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,340
I have to be able to fend for myself,

121
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,120
for Aunt to be reassured and return to her own life.

122
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,230
She'll think she finished raising us.

123
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,670
Or she'll always be hanging onto us for the rest of her life.

124
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:43,390
So what? Are you fully grown?

125
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:51,470
♫  So beautiful, I can feel it  ♫

126
00:10:51,470 --> 00:11:00,560
♫  When I see you, the feelings in my frozen heart  ♫

127
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,200
♫  Like the warm spring...   ♫

128
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,430
No. I'm still growing.

129
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,800
♫  Dream-like love, don't you know it yet?  ♫

130
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,790
♫  You always change me  ♫

131
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:25,830
♫  I'm happy you're here  ♫

132
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,400
 I am no longer alone.

133
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,290
♫  I miss you  ♫

134
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:43,840
♫  even more today  ♫

135
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,670
 I saw a dolphin here once.

136
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:05,230
I found out later that it was a bottlenose dolphin.

137
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:09,410
It's an endangered species. Isn't it so sad?

138
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,220
I can't say I'm not entirely responsible for that.

139
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,110
But you guys should do better, too.

140
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,730
Right. It's the humans' fault.

141
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,870
But I wasn't blaming you.

142
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,580
Hey, why are you laughing?

143
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,790
Because it's funny.

144
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,450
What's funny?

145
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:34,110
- You're funny. 
 - Why am I funny?

146
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,280
Why am I funny?

147
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,250
 Together, we're headed somewhere.

148
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:55,620
 Pitying and loving. Together.

149
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,980
What's wrong?

150
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,800
Do you want to bet?

151
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,330
The winner gets whatever asked.

152
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,630
What do you want to have?

153
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,420
Your car.

154
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,670
Or...

155
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,880
something else.

156
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,630
Let's do it.

157
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,340
Say it.

158
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,420
What do you want?

159
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,220
Later.

160
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,220
I'll tell you when I want something from you later.

161
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,370
Why? You don't have anything you want from me now?

162
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,740
You said you wanted my car.

163
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,380
Take it.

164
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,850
Don't offer it like you're nice.

165
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,690
Because I'll win it.

166
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,070
 Later. I'll tell you when I want something from you later.

167
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,410
Welcom—

168
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,990
Let's date.

169
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:34,250
- What? 
 - Let's just date three times.

170
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,170
So I can figure out if this feeling is lingering affection or real.

171
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,920
Let's decide after we date three times.

172
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,910
- Okay. 
 - Don't contact me first or just come over to my place.

173
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,110
Okay.

174
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,740
I'll call you first,  so wait.

175
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,010
Okay, I will wait.

176
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:58,490
- It might take a while. 
 - I'll still wait.

177
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,270
I'm off.

178
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,810
I'll wait!

179
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:26,540
 - Hello.  
 - I just asked Lee Hyeon Kyu to date me.

180
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,170
Let's cancel our contract.

181
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,890
There won't be any penalty, so relax.

182
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,590
It would be best if you never saw me again, right?

183
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:00,260
We won't bump into each other at work, either.

184
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,090
No.

185
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,010
Why not?

186
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,610
Because I want to make it in the top ten.

187
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,140
Is that all?

188
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,370
Yes.

189
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:19,070
Then either send me an email or a text.

190
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,790
I'll say when this contract is broken.

191
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:28,200
- I'm going to tell Lee Hyeon Kyu that you kissed me. 
 - Can you do that?

192
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,260
- Do you think I can't? 
 - No, I don't think you can.

193
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,230
Go ahead and tell him. If you can.

194
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,150
Such a douche.

195
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,160
You tend to get rained on or snowed on.

196
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,250
What?

197
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,350
What?

198
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:22,490
I'm coming. Okay, I'll be right there.

199
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,340
Aunt left the house, too.

200
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,610
She said you need a place to come back whenever.

201
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,960
I never knew I'd come here with you, though.

202
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,030
I want to make a wish.

203
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,660
A wish?

204
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,140
My birthday wish.

205
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,910
That wish is...

206
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:07,520
Not the wish that I wished then. A different wish.

207
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,490
Forgive me.

208
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,310
Forgive what?

209
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:26,240
I told them you were here.

210
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,220
Just in case they were worried.

211
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,890
Noona!

212
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,210
What! Let me go!

213
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,420
Auntie.

214
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,940
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

215
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,260
I asked you out here because I wanted to talk to you.

216
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,730
I think I'm a coward, Uncle.

217
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,190
Yeah, Jeju's beautiful. Look at the sea.

218
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,620
I couldn't even run away properly.

219
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,530
And I just hurt people's feelings.

220
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,540
This is where I got my family.

221
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,870
I don't know what to do.

222
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,980
If I live, he'll die.

223
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:03,780
If he lives then all of us will die.

224
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,060
What should I do?

225
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,960
What should I do with my heart?

226
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,290
Eo tteok hae?

227
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,730
Don't worry. We're family.

228
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,390
I want you to think of me as family and lean on me.

229
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:20,670
- Family? 
 - Yeah, family.

230
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,330
I know how you feel.

231
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,620
I'm going to do my best to find a great hospital.

232
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,770
The best way was to die alone.

233
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:33,250
That's why I came here.

234
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,660
But not loving isn't working.

235
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,930
I love you too, Dong Kyeong.

236
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,260
I love everything Soo loves. Just hang in there.

237
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,380
Everything's going to be better.

238
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,810
Love. Right.

239
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:50,300
That's scary.

240
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,760
My love is too... heavy.

241
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,720
You're welcome. But family doesn't have to say thank you.

242
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,660
"I love you" is enough.

243
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,490
Doctor.

244
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:28,800
Can you get the onion from the groceries I got?

245
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,740
Wash that over there.

246
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,550
Thank you.

247
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,250
For calling me.

248
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,600
I thought you might be worried.

249
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,060
Dong Kyeong was worried the whole time.

250
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,930
Dong Kyeong was?

251
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:10,120
All she talked about all day was you, her brother, and her unni.

252
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:17,320
You know what? My life motto is "all in."

253
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,700
We just looked alike

254
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,650
but my sister and I were total opposites.

255
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:29,640
Just like I got this temper from the other half.

256
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:34,050
She was calm and gentle.

257
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:39,240
When I got a call saying that she was dead,

258
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,010
I felt like half of my body was ripped out.

259
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:48,810
My other half left them. How can't I give my all?

260
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:52,350
Just like it was given, I lived for them.

261
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,100
But she...

262
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,890
Dong Kyeong was like that since she was little.

263
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:02,340
She wouldn't talk when something tough happened.

264
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,840
She just hid somewhere all by herself.

265
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,850
Then I would get so anxious and look for her.

266
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:13,250
When I found her, she was always sitting at some beach.

267
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,150
It made me so upset.

268
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:19,210
She was there just like she was homeless.

269
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,640
Now she must have a home.

270
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,150
Seeing that she returned here.

271
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:07,080
Still, it's good that she doesn't seem like she's in pain.

272
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,630
It's not her body, but her mind that's the problem.

273
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,300
Make sure you keep your eye on her.

274
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,100
She's really good at pretending to be okay.

275
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,910
Why the heck is she so good at pretending she's okay?

276
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:20,410
Her life was like that.

277
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:24,550
She was always so worried that she'd become a burden for someone.

278
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:28,590
Maybe that's why she came here. Because she didn't want to burden us.

279
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,540
Stop crying.

280
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,000
I'm not crying. It's just that the wind is cold.

281
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,230
When the wind is cold, I get teary.

282
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,270
I was born like that.

283
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,830
Yes, Boss.

284
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:58,990
Yes. I met my sister.

285
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,400
I'm sorry for saying so suddenly that I can't be there.

286
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,660
The beans?

287
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,490
They said they'll be there by tomorrow morning.

288
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:11,960
Okay. Goodbye, Boss.

289
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,350
Boss? Do you work?

290
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,230
Yes, at a cafe.

291
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,080
A cafe?

292
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,620
Why does everyone work at a cafe?

293
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:24,430
When you're mad like this, it's always because of a guy.

294
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:27,550
You know that guy that I said I was going to kill.

295
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:30,360
I met him again recently. He owns a cafe.

296
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,760
Wow, I envy him. I want to own a cafe.

297
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,750
- He wants to date me. 
 - Wow.

298
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,950
- So I said okay. 
 - Wow!

299
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,090
So annoying.

300
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:43,590
I wanted to kill him, but when he smiled in front of me, my heart just melted away again.

301
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,030
That's good. Being mad is not good for your health.

302
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:49,820
But the problem is that there is someone else I want to kill.

303
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,780
- Another one? 
 - And they know each other.

304
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,100
They even live together yet never told me.

305
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,940
Aren't they totally playing me?

306
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,460
This is so confusing.

307
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,780
So you're dating want-to-kill #1,

308
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,330
then want-to-kill #2 showed up?

309
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,950
Yeah.

310
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,650
What the heck? Then, do you like him?

311
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:10,500
- Which one? 
 - #2.

312
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,600
No, I'm dating #1.

313
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,120
But why are you dating #1 when you like #2?

314
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,520
You're so stupid. You're not good at language arts, right?

315
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,770
What the? Who's stupid here?

316
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:23,890
You tend to want to kill the person you like.

317
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:30,210
#1, you wanted to kill. Past tense.

318
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,150
#2, you want to kill. Present.

319
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,080
Jeez.

320
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,030
Stop saying nonsense and bring in the side dishes!

321
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,270
Why isn't this coming off?

322
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:35,910
♫  I still with you, I'm still here  ♫

323
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:42,680
♫  Do you still remember the day we first met?  ♫

324
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:49,930
♫  I still with you, again today, like this  ♫

325
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:57,750
♫  When I look at you, the time stops completely  ♫

326
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:04,800
♫  When I close my eyes  ♫

327
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:11,130
♫  It feels like I'm walking through a dream with you  ♫

328
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,810
It's snowing!

329
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:24,110
♫  Just once is enough  ♫

330
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:29,150
♫  Leave it as a memory  ♫

331
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:33,120
It's snowing, Noona! It's so pretty.

332
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,390
Should we make a snowman? Let's make one!

333
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:44,080
♫  Love you, I only need you  ♫

334
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,930
♫  You You  ♫

335
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:55,320
♫  Wherever Whenever  ♫

336
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:00,100
♫  Because it's only you  ♫

337
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:10,040
I came here to run away from everything.

338
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,420
But running away wasn't running away.

339
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:16,680
I thought I ran away but when I got here,

340
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,910
everything I love was here.

341
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,030
So...

342
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:25,760
I missed everyone so much.

343
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,060
You're not the runaway kind.

344
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:34,210
You live all tense like you're taking on the world. You can't run away.

345
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,890
I can't run away with you.

346
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:41,250
But when you take it on, I'll always be on your side.

347
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,990
Why is it so nice here?

348
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:48,880
How long has it been since we came to Jeju together?

349
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,730
It's so nice that there are no people since it's a weekday.

350
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,260
That's why it's nice to be a freelancer and be jobless.

351
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:00,970
Let's live forever and go have fun at places when others are working.

352
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:03,970
What? Then are you saying I should be jobless for good?

353
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:07,620
You just spend. I will earn like a dog.

354
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:15,730
Take out your phone. Let's take a picture when the sun's nice.

355
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,160
Okay.

356
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,590
Here. You take it.

357
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,890
Let's see.

358
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,880
By the way, what happened when you went that time?

359
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,690
Hmm? When?

360
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:37,350
You left after getting a call that time.

361
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:42,010
Oh, that. It's fine. I just cursed and broke a laptop to scare him.

362
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,410
What?

363
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:46,220
Ji Jo King, that bastard, said that I plagiarized his work.

364
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,870
What?

365
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:51,100
I said it's fine. I handled it well.

366
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,630
But that laptop ended up being Team Leader Cha's.

367
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:01,190
Unnie.

368
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:04,770
Do you like Team Leader Cha?

369
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,250
What?

370
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,790
Am I nuts? I'm dating Lee Hyeon Kyu.

371
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,860
What? Lee Hyeon Kyu? That Lee Hyeon Kyu?

372
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,590
You know what's better? He's on the first floor of your workplace.

373
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,780
"The beacon does not shine on its own base."

374
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:20,330
The handsome cafe owner?

375
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:24,520
That guy when he smiles it's like in the movies?

376
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,470
He is kind of handsome, huh?

377
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,910
What are you going to do? You like Team Leader Cha.

378
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:33,320
I don't like him!

379
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,050
It shows!

380
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,340
Are you going somewhere?

381
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,830
- Come in after you talk. 
 - Okay.

382
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,660
I'm going somewhere for a bit.

383
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,130
To where?

384
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,750
To the hospital.

385
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:59,020
Something must've happened to her.

386
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,850
I'll be back soon. It won't take long. Just wait here.

387
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,990
Hey, let's go together. You go first.

388
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:08,430
I'll be there soon. I'll be there with you.

389
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,360
You're here?

390
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,150
Why didn't you tell me?

391
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,330
It's fine.

392
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:50,600
This is all just part of the plan.

393
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:55,530
I remember why I tried so hard not to love.

394
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,830
If I love, I get hurt.

395
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:03,060
Because if the ones I love disappear,

396
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,350
it's too hard.

397
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:10,070
The things humans create are always grand.

398
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:15,530
Whether it be sins or love, they always shake up the world.

399
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,890
Should've not loved at all, no matter what.

400
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:32,070
It's okay. It's all okay.

401
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,240
I'll be born again.

402
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,820
What should I do? You should know the answer.

403
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,520
Don't act like you don't know. Just tell me.

404
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,450
God lives for humans.

405
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:53,220
That's what I was made for.

406
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:58,500
I live for humans, then I disappear for their sake.

407
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,960
That's our job.

408
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:00,080
What's this?

409
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:05,020
Comfort. Like what you did for me.

410
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:26,440
Is she really not doing well?

411
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:30,030
She doesn't have much time left.

412
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:35,770
It's okay. It has always happened.

413
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,830
Oh, Dad's calling.

414
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,100
- Woo Jin! 
 - Mom!

415
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,120
Are you all right?

416
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,790
Thank you.  Thank you.

417
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:30,090
Can you do that kind of thing?

418
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,520
- No, I can't. 
 - What?

419
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:37,430
I can't, but I do it. Because you're watching.

420
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,550
From time to time, I just see you in everything.

421
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:49,470
After coming to love you,

422
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:55,100
humans are pitiful and lovely to me.

423
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,540
I think I understand, just a little bit,

424
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,060
why she loves humans so much.

425
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:32,070

426
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,520
Hello?

427
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,490
  Oh, you're finally picking up. Where are you, Tak Dong Kyeong?

428
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:41,040
Mr. Park?

429
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,400
  Come to work right this instant! If not, Lee Hyeon is getting sued!

430
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:53,370
So, what now? Want me to do what's normally done? Just say the word.

431
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:59,270
No. I take care of my own murders.

432
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,780
Follow me.

433
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,590
Manager Tak, just save me this once!

434
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,800
Why are you being like this? Let go while you talk!

435
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,380
- Manager Tak! I'm going to die! 
 - Let go while you talk, I said!

436
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,390
It's just that you're gone, Team Leader Cha's gone,

437
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:46,490
and all the authors are saying they won't continue with their contracts.

438
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:48,210
I'm going to die!

439
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:51,130
Why are you being like this to me?

440
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,830
This is all because of you!

441
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:55,630
You made all the novelists this way!

442
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:59,270
What? What did you just say?

443
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:05,190
I mean, how hard did you work for them to be like this?

444
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:09,740
They just don't want to be on the same side as the bad guy. We just have that in common.

445
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:14,570
Of course! I was so flustered that time, that I wasn't able to take your side.

446
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,820
I'm always on your side, though.

447
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,760
It's so nice to see you!

448
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,890
Are you healthy? You're not hurting anywhere?

449
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:25,140
I knew that that man would mess up badly one day.

450
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,990
It's just so hard to make a living, Dong Kyeong.

451
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:31,270
You know, the people you hate, that you still have to take accountability for.

452
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:35,270
I'm really doing the most to just get by with them.

453
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:37,430
Think of the others out there.

454
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,940
I can't even pay their salaries if it's like this.

455
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,600
If our company is doomed, they're all doomed, too!

456
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,540
You have some nerve talking about them after writing them off.

457
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:50,520
That's right! Yes, I'm the bad guy. Dong Kyeong! Dong Kyeong! All right.

458
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,670
I'm going to ask you of this.

459
00:42:55,290 --> 00:43:00,740
Please, just meet them once. Just once, and convince them.

460
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:05,860
It might be hard to work with them because of your illness, but that's not the case for Team Leader Cha.

461
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,380
If you're not going to cooperate with me, I'm going to have to sue Writer Lee Hyeon!

462
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,270
What are you suing her for?!

463
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:15,140
Vandalism, obstruction of business!  You know that I will do it if I set my mind to it, right?

464
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:19,670
No, but! How am I going to talk to the team leader, when he quit?

465
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,570
Team Leader Cha...

466
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:28,460
Team Leader Cha is always near us.

467
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,840
What?

468
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,940
Up there. He lives up there.

469
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:38,230
He's the building owner's son.

470
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,470
Please give me some money.

471
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:45,460
Money? Why?

472
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,360
I caused a problem, so I'm going to settle things.

473
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,430
I didn't change my golf club for this.

474
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:57,910
- I'll handle it well and pay you back. 
 - What are you going to handle well?

475
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:00,560
How much do you need?

476
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,650
I'm going to form a company.

477
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:04,720
Why would you do that?

478
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,610
Who's going to take care of the building right now?

479
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:09,970
I'll take care of the building as I normally did. The company is just for a hobby.

480
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:12,370
You little brat. You would do that for a hobby?

481
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:15,630
Well, it'll be less costly compared to your hobby, and earn me more money.

482
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:18,550
If you weren't such a smooth talker...

483
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,210
How much for interest?

484
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:23,030
Why would a father ask for interest from his son?

485
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:25,010
Then, go to a bank and ask for money.

486
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:29,430
All right, all right. I'll take into account the interest for you, too.

487
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:31,880
You should've said so from the start.

488
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:36,250
If you started a business like Hyeon Kyu...

489
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:40,070
- Wait, but, why did he do that last time? 
 - Last time?

490
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:44,910
He hugged me and called me father. That whole fuss.

491
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:47,900
He was trying to protect me.

492
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,950
Guess it's worth it for you to raise him like that.

493
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:52,890
Maybe I should've raised him a bit less.

494
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:56,450
Why? Is he giving you a hard time now that he's all grown?

495
00:44:56,450 --> 00:45:00,760
Well... He's a bit too much to handle.

496
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:04,790
I guess it's time for him to compete against you now.

497
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,350

498
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,820
Welcome.

499
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,170
No way.

500
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:49,920
This is why you would come to work early and get off late.

501
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:54,390
I'm not sure if you're talking to yourself or just speaking informally to me.

502
00:45:55,090 --> 00:46:00,100
It's scary. Truly scary. There's no one you can trust.

503
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:03,360
This one's definite. You're speaking informally to me.

504
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,740
Are you really the building owner?

505
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:08,270
Not me. My dad.

506
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:15,090
- No, but, that sports car in the garage. Is that yours? 
 - Yeah.

507
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:21,410
Then, by any chance, are there any other buildings other than this one?

508
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:22,990
Yeah.

509
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:26,290
This is the smallest building. Others are managed by my brother or father.

510
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:30,570
Then, why does the building owner's son work at such a low-paying job?

511
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:32,860
Because it was close from home.

512
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,020
How deceiving.

513
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:40,910
Why did you quit?

514
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:44,020
Same reason as you. I couldn't take it anymore.

515
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:46,100
You were so good at taking it.

516
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:52,250
I know. I can't really take it these days.

517
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:56,200
Why? Is it because the CEO said something to Unni?

518
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,810
I heard it all from Unni.

519
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:00,850
Probably not all.

520
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,400
Just as expected, there is something going on.

521
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,970
I guess she said enough for you to expect.

522
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:09,480
So, what are you going to do now?

523
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,890
I'm going to form a company.

524
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:14,130
That's why I wanted to see you.

525
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:17,360
Manager Tak, get well soon.

526
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:20,170
When you come back better, I'll make you a manager right away.

527
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,220
That wasn't my question.

528
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:29,440
Forget it.

529
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,090
And I will ask for a very high salary.

530
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:36,740
How about I promote you? What do you think of a director?

531
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:39,420
No, thanks. Salary, no matter what.

532
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,950
What's your salary now?

533
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:43,200
I'm sorry.

534
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,870
It's fine. You had your reasons.

535
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:49,230
I will work harder.

536
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:51,950
How's your sister? Is she okay?

537
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:56,710
No. But she'll be fine.

538
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,080
Okay.

539
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,260
Noona!

540
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:08,470
Are you Seon Kyeong's sister?

541
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:10,440
I've seen you often.

542
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,600
Why are you here? Did you come to see me? I'm doing well at work.

543
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,810
Seon Kyeong is really good at work. He works hard—

544
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:21,730
I just stopped by on my way. (Ji Na gadaga)

545
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:23,430
Just stopped by. (Ji Na gadaga)

546
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:26,350
Would you like a cup of coffee? It's on the house.

547
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:29,170
Sure, thank you so much.

548
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:35,130
How could I not have known?

549
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,120
Excuse me?

550
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,820
Nothing.

551
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:46,250
I was thinking how I could've missed such a good coffee place.

552
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:48,110
Oh, right.

553
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:49,620
What?

554
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:55,720
Coffee's ready. You like iced americano, right? That's what you always get.

555
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,680
You have a really good memory.

556
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,990
Wow.

557
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:05,440
Coffee learned abroad is really different.

558
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:10,040
How did you know I studied abroad for coffee?

559
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,150
Because I could smell it. The smell of escape study abroad.

560
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:17,060
Gosh, my bad. Coffee study abroad smell.

561
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,610
What's wrong, Noona?

562
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:23,300
Are you hurting? Should we go to the hospital? Are words confusing?

563
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,740
I'm not hurting. I'm totally fine.

564
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:28,080
The coffee's waking me up.

565
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:32,580
I heard that you swam.

566
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:35,430
Where did you hear that?

567
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:38,450
Just from someone.

568
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:42,700
It wasn't me. I didn't tell her.

569
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:47,260
If you swam, then are you good at submerging (ghosting)?

570
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:51,100
Well... I might be a little better than just regular people.

571
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:56,920
A little better. So swimming makes you better at submerging (ghosting)?

572
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,190
Sorry?

573
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:02,520
What are your opinions about breaking up through ghosting?

574
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:08,540
Well... It's a very cowardly way.

575
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:11,390
Right? Very cowardly.

576
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:15,430
Why do you think people do that?

577
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,770
What's up, Noona?

578
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:19,570
Is Hyungnim ghosting you?

579
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:21,130
No.

580
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:27,320
Since I was (Na Ji Na)

581
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:31,600
just passing by, I'll get going.

582
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,270
What the? Why did you come?

583
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:37,280
You're going? See you again.

584
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:43,080
What's with her?

585
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:49,080
I think she's fine.

586
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,630
Right.

587
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:57,840
Na Ji Na, such a weakling for looks.

588
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,170
 I'm stopping the series for personal reasons.

589
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:14,860
 I thank all the readers who've been reading my lacking work.

590
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:18,410
 I will be back with a new work.

591
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:20,260

592
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:28,410
 I saw all of your writing, and all you need is one thing.

593
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:30,490
 A new male lead.

594
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:33,410
A new male lead...

595
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:55,090
 Who in the world said that the first love never works out?

596
00:51:55,090 --> 00:52:00,590
 Ji Woo felt like she needed to kill whoever said that.

597
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:06,900
 Even though it was not that person's fault that her love wasn't working out, Ji Woo wanted to do that.

598
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:11,100
 Because she couldn't kill her first love with her own hands.

599
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:16,330
 Even though she wasn't sure if she'd have enough energy even if they met.

600
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:21,270
 Ji Woo's been sniffling in front of his house for the past three hours.

601
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:24,850
 "Can't go."

602
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:29,330
 "Who is that?" when she looked up to an unfamiliar voice,

603
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:34,330
 an unfamiliar man just like his voice was standing in front of Ji Woo.

604
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:38,790
 The man that she could see with her sight messed up with tears and rain all mixed up,

605
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:43,400
 was looking her down with literally no expression.

606
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,660
 "People can't go if you're there like that."

607
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:53,090
 The first kiss with a stranger tasted like a rain shower.

608
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:59,860
 Ji Woo knew then.

609
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:04,690
 "I won't be able to avoid

610
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:07,090
 him, his love."

611
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:24,500
I'm almost home. Are you home?

612
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:29,390
No.

613
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:33,650
I barely avoided murdering by saying patience three times in my mind.

614
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:38,260
My aunt?

615
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:42,060
She said she had a place to be and said she won't be home today.

616
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:51,310
Yeah?

617
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:09,940
Being like this brings back memories from long ago.

618
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:13,760
It's not long ago. It's relatively recent.

619
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:20,640
Your big flaw is that you keep talking back. It really breaks all the mood.

620
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,920
I'm not talking back. I'm just stating facts.

621
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:28,850
You're still the same. Nothing has changed.

622
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:31,990
You were really annoying back then, too.

623
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:33,840
Why was I so annoying?

624
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,090
You were so annoying in many ways.

625
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:39,130
And cute very rarely.

626
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:43,100
Cute? Me?

627
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:48,060
I know you turned the lights off back then.

628
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:13,110
 I always thought the darkness was something so scary and fearful.

629
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,120
But then I felt it for the first time.

630
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:20,630
Some kindness and warm-heartedness can be dark.

631
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:27,470
That's not it. I just turned it off because I like the dark.

632
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:31,260
I told you to stop saying things to break the mood.

633
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:43,330
You aren't even reading.

634
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:44,720
I turned the page.

635
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,530
You're not reading, right?

636
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,280
You want some?

637
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,590
I don't eat anything.

638
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:56,080
You do pretend to eat.

639
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,050
- Should I just play along? 
 - Yes.

640
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:02,140
There isn't a doctor named that.

641
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:04,280
There's no way.

642
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:08,240
I got a consultation from him a few days ago.

643
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:14,370
These are our neurologists at our hospital.

644
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:17,560
Why isn't he here?

645
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:22,300
I had a consultation with Doctor Lee Yun Ho with my niece for sure.

646
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:26,460
He said that my niece was on the list to try out the new medication.

647
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,210
I think you're mistaken.

648
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:32,090
Maybe you should contact your niece and come back.

649
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:36,650
There's no way. I most definitely had a consultation with him.

650
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:38,360
Soo Ja, what's wrong?

651
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:42,890
I'm sorry, but it doesn't look like there's anything we can do to help.

652
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:50,820
There's no way.

653
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:55,060
I even had a consultation with him. Why isn't he here?

654
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:59,430
Kevin! Something's weird.

655
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:06,930
I definitely saw him, even talked to him.

656
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:11,190
Oh my. The ghost must have come back.

657
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:13,540
What?

658
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:16,490
There's a ghost in this hospital.

659
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:18,990
- A ghost? 
 - Yes.

660
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:21,280
They've been saying this for a few years.

661
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,810
There are so many who saw that doctor.

662
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:28,040
Since both our bodies and minds are weak, they must keep attracting the ghost.

663
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:32,030
You should look for another hospital. It's too late for me.

664
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:34,660
What do you mean a ghost?

665
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,310
That makes no sense.

666
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:40,430
If it wasn't a ghost, then you were scammed.

667
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:45,410
So leaving the scammed one aside, the other two made it up.

668
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:50,050
But you said she's your niece. Why would a niece scam her aunt?

669
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:53,840
Does that even make sense at such a big hospital like this?

670
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,980
Security is keeping watch.

671
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:00,070
No way. It has to be a ghost.

672
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,760
Seriously...

673
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:15,720
Why are you like this? Oh my, what's wrong?

674
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,450
Doctor!

675
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:19,800
Doctor, can you come over here?

676
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,490
- What happened? 
 - Are you okay?

677
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:29,500
I like that the moon is so big and bright from over here.

678
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,050
Even if it's the same moon.

679
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:32,940
I know right.

680
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:38,680
It's the same moon, but when I look at it from here, it's more pretty.

681
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:47,470
If I'm born again, I want to be born as that moon.

682
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:54,290
Sun, star, moon, wind. Things like that.

683
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:57,900
Not living, but just existing.

684
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:01,070
I want to be born as something like that.

685
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:09,170
Then if you go back, what would you do?

686
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,950
If you can travel across time.

687
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:17,280
Who knows.

688
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:23,070
Even if I go back, I will make the same choice.

689
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:26,990
Meet you, love you,

690
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:30,570
and walk with you like this.

691
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:38,230
I know that must not be the case for you.

692
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:47,130
I don't regret it.

693
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:54,060
After knowing you, my world changed.

694
00:59:58,270 --> 01:00:02,250
I got this from that kid at the hospital.

695
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:08,270
Everything inside this depends on my love.

696
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:11,390
She asked me if I'm afraid.

697
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:16,890
I was afraid.

698
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:18,850
But...

699
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:24,150
I'm not afraid anymore.

700
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:33,390
♫  I felt like I was walking alone  ♫

701
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:34,830
♫  I was about to be sad  ♫

702
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:37,320
I'm not afraid.

703
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:40,910
Now.

704
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:46,470
♫  It felt like you might come to me  ♫

705
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:53,500

706
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,490
Hello?

707
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,530
Aunt!

708
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:13,600
I'm fine. Don't overreact.

709
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,860
It's just a stomach cramp caused by stress.

710
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:18,240
Stomach cramp? Are you in a lot of pain?

711
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,460
Do you want me to go buy porridge outside?

712
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:23,180
Uncle didn't eat anything either, right?

713
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:32,170
Tak Dong Kyeong.

714
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,540
Huh?

715
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:40,350
After I came to the hospital, I heard something weird.

716
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:45,330
You should explain.

717
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:49,600
I came here to meet the doctor we consulted last time,

718
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:54,230
but they said that doctor doesn't exist at this hospital.

719
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:01,530
Then, is everything I heard fake?

720
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:03,620
Aunt, that...

721
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:06,890
That's enough. Don't say more. Get admitted to a hospital right away.

722
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,930
Kevin will find a new hospital for you.

723
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:11,000
Aunt...

724
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,860
The new hospital will be as nice as this one.

725
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:16,810
I got an appointment, so get admitted at that hospital and go through new examinations–

726
01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:18,730
Aunt...

727
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:28,370
I... will die anyway, even if I get admitted to the hospital.

728
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,660
What are you saying right now?

729
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:34,490
I...

730
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:42,230
am going to die. Even if I get the surgery.

731
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:49,100
You... why would you die?

732
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:52,710
- Why would you die? 
 - Soo, take it easy.

733
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:58,180
Let's at least get admitted to this hospital right now.

734
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:05,300
Let's get admitted, Dong Kyeong...

735
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:10,700
Get admitted right now!

736
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:15,290
Aunt... Aunt!

737
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:17,520
Are you okay?

738
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,090
Doctor!

739
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:22,670
Get admitted, Dong Kyeong!

740
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:25,080
I will check her chart.

741
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,050
Aunt...

742
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:39,050
Soo needs absolute bed rest right now.

743
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:43,990
If Soo and Dong Kyeong... stay together,

744
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:46,470
it'll be bad for both of you.

745
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:53,460
Just... I need you to go somewhere and wait until she calms down. And then I'll call you, okay?

746
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:55,460
I'm sorry, Dong Kyeong.

747
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:25,940
It's too difficult.

748
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:34,430
Help me. Please help me.

749
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,080
I don't know what to do.

750
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:42,540
I don't know how to explain that I'm going to die no matter what I do.

751
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:45,670
If I didn't know that, if I didn't know that at least, I–

752
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:47,710
I will help you.

753
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:53,830
Are you going to save me?

754
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:58,580
No. I can't save you.

755
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:01,350
That was your destiny.

756
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:10,630
But I can change the fate of the two of you slightly.

757
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:17,430
I will be erasing both of you from each other's fate. As if it didn't exist from the beginning.

758
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:25,450
Then you will die according to your destiny, without knowing anything.

759
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:29,180
Like a normal patient, you will get treated and work hard

760
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:32,890
and slowly face death like that.

761
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:36,450
You both will have no memories of each other, and the contract will become void.

762
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:45,060
But because of your choice, the world will not be doomed or the person you love won't die.

763
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:52,100
Do you want that?

764
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:02,320
I don't have much time.

765
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:06,670
Hurry. You have to decide.

766
01:07:11,350 --> 01:07:18,490
♫  It’s about to fall off, it's dangerous  ♫

767
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:24,460
♫  I’m sorry I'm tearing up yeah  ♫

768
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:32,730
♫  The darkness falls down and disappears  ♫

769
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:37,590
♫  In the frozen time  ♫

770
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:43,320
♫  They’ll disappear without a trace  ♫

771
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:48,760
♫  Why can't it stop?  ♫

772
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:53,930
♫  My last favor  ♫

773
01:07:53,930 --> 01:08:02,790
♫  I'm breaking down, falling apart  ♫

774
01:08:02,790 --> 01:08:07,960
♫  Shining in the darkness  ♫

775
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:16,720
♫  I’m breaking down, living in the consciousness  ♫

776
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:21,020
♫  Inside my memory  ♫

777
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:34,030

778
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:41,820

779
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:44,310
 I don't remember well.

780
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:46,280
 It's one of the symptoms.

781
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,490
 They don't know anything.

782
01:08:49,490 --> 01:08:51,690
 I wish you'd answer me clearly.

783
01:08:51,690 --> 01:08:52,950
 If I should steal...

784
01:08:52,950 --> 01:08:54,220
 Or forget?

785
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:56,300
 Or love by myself.

786
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:58,020
  Tak Dong Kyeong...

787
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:03,070
 Tell me. What did you do to me?

788
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:06,190
 I didn't do it to you, but to her.

789
01:09:06,190 --> 01:09:08,310
  Help me.

790
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,160
 Who are you?

791
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:16,220
♫  Inside my memory  ♫
