1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,680

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,560

3
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:28,090

4
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:33,860

5
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,850

6
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:49,050

7
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:59,260

8
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,670

9
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,950
Why are you like this? Did something happen?

10
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,450
♫  I stand alone again at that same spot  ♫

11
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,570
I love you.

12
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,890
I... am in love with you.

13
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:51,010
♫  I hear a low sound  ♫

14
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,210
♫  It's you  ♫

15
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,470
♫  It's you who held onto me  ♫

16
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,290
- Then let's date. 
 - What?

17
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:03,300
Let's date. Starting today.

18
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,820
♫  I wanna be with you  ♫

19
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,170
 Tak Dong Kyeong! Where did she go at this hour? Tak Dong Kyeong!

20
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:15,870
Aunt! I'm on the phone! I'll be right in!

21
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,630
Go. I'll call you tomorrow.

22
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:25,980
♫  Wait for me at the end of this road  ♫

23
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,930
Get home safely.

24
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,380
♫  I wanna be with you  ♫

25
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,410
Are you seeing anyone right now?

26
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,350
- What? 
 - Are you seeing anyone right now?

27
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,770
- No, but– 
 - How about someone you like?

28
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,880
Even if you do, date me.

29
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:04,040
No matter who that person is, I met you first and I liked you first.

30
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,400
And... because I still like you.

31
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,560
You're annoying.

32
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,090
I'm so annoyed because of you. You're making me crazy!

33
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,090
Don't laugh!

34
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,360
Don't smile.

35
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,220
 The laundry–

36
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,870
I... have decided to date him.

37
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,630
Lee Hyeon Kyu came by yesterday.

38
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,530
That Lee Hyeon Kyu?

39
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,340
And so? Did you beat him up?

40
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,100
Wait, but who's he?

41
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,460
Why did he come? For what reason?

42
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,820
Answer me first! Who is he?

43
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:15,760
That-That guy you saw last time. He said he loved me.

44
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:22,020
What? Then you guys were living with each other even though you weren't dating?

45
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,340
Is that how things turn out?

46
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,290
I told him we should live together not knowing this would happen.

47
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:36,000
I guess we can't live with each other anymore even though we're dating, because of my aunt.

48
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,350
Who are you? You keep surprising me!

49
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,620
Don't tell my aunt.

50
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,930
About what? The fact that you were living together or that you're dating?

51
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,830
What do you mean "um"! Of course, it's about living together!

52
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,820
Is it?

53
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,550
How are you like this?

54
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,550
Unni! So did you beat up Lee Hyeon Kyu?

55
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:04,560
I didn't beat him up, but it's similar. I did throw something at him.

56
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,630
What? Your heart?

57
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,990
He obviously came without thinking too much.

58
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,940
But I broke down in front of him in an embarrassing way.

59
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,090
With one smile from him, it was like I was 18-year-old Na Ji Na again.

60
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,760
I'm pathetic.

61
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,900
What do you mean you're pathetic?

62
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,190
I really loved 18-year-old Na Ji Na, who was brave when it came to love.

63
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,100
- Tak. 
 - But, of course, I love 29-year-old Na Ji Na too.

64
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,060
- I love you too, Tak. 
 - Hey, it's going to spill!

65
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,970
So, Tak, when are you going to the hospital?

66
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,930
Oh.

67
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,830
Didn't you hear from my aunt?

68
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,460
Still, go to the hospital.

69
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:00,300
I won't be able to handle it if you were to suddenly collapse again like last time.

70
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,210
- I won't. 
 - Why don't you want to go?

71
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:09,020
It's not that I don't want to go, but I have something to take care of.

72
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,800
Someone that I need to see and things to take care of. That's why.

73
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,360
You'll go after you're done meeting everyone you need to see and finish taking care of everything you need to?

74
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,360
Hold on.

75
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,960
Yes. This is Lee Hyeon.

76
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,050
What?

77
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,520
All right.

78
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,490
- I need to go. 
 - Did something happen?

79
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,020
No, don't worry about it.

80
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,760
- Never mind. Let me drop you off first. 
 - Forget it.

81
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,390
I have a boyfriend, too.

82
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:48,070
Oh right!  You have a boyfriend. That guy that thinks he's cool.

83
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,420
If something happens, let me know.

84
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,660
I got it. You think I'm a kid.

85
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:57,590
You'll forever be a kid to me. A 17-year-old kid with their hood on.

86
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,220
I'm really going!

87
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,060
Unni!

88
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,530
Huh?

89
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,190
Thank you.

90
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,370
Yeah, right. I'm leaving!

91
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,060
Hi.

92
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:04,150
I didn't think you'd contact me like this. Have some, you are a guest.

93
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,020
Ah right, I'm a guest.

94
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,990
I was debating if I should call or not.

95
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,620
You should have.

96
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,590
I thought it might be better if I just came.

97
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,230
You could call me and come.

98
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:24,560
You must be a very straightforward person when it comes to dating.

99
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,090
- Dating? 
 - Huh? What did I just say?

100
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:32,070
Hey! But you're almost a human! Knowing how to wait on others.

101
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,930
That's my specialty. Waiting and watching people.

102
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,430
But I decided I don't want to do that anymore.

103
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,830
- Why not? 
 - Because time is precious.

104
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,130
Why are you moving away?

105
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,460
Because you might need more space.

106
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,020
We even slept together on a small bed, because you said we should.

107
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:05,160
No, it wasn't small. The bed was big.

108
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,330
Wow, this! How much is this?

109
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,730
Put it down. Let's talk after you've put it down.

110
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,530
Hey. You think I might break this, don't you?

111
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,580
Put it down and talk.

112
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,030
Why? I don't want to.

113
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,990
It must be really expensive.

114
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,000
It's not that.

115
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,960
You don't have hands right now.

116
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,000
- Huh? 
 - And the wall is right behind you.

117
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,770
Hey you! If you come any closer, I'm going to break this!

118
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,190
That's really expensive. In the ₩10,000,000s.

119
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,500
I'm getting a phone call.

120
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,160
- And so? 
 - I need to take it...

121
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
Seon Kyeong.

122
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,970
I needed to get rid of Tak Seon Kyeong first.

123
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,930
Hey!

124
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,100
So... which part is plagiarized?

125
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,100
The part where the students are eating spicy rice cakes?

126
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,560
It makes no sense!

127
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,670
If that part was plagiarized, would our novelists be able to write comfortably?

128
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,300
What?

129
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:13,060
You called me over to tell me that I plagiarized your work.

130
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,760
How could someone who calls themself a novelist only hear portions of what I'm saying?

131
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,800
When did I say that you plagiarized? I said things are getting hot.

132
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,660
- You definitely said earlier– 
 - No.

133
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,230
One of my avid fans is like this.

134
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:33,530
Plagiarize? Yeah, right. If they say something else, I'll tell them that I gave you permission.

135
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,930
What?

136
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:39,440
In case that your soft heart might get hurt,

137
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,330
I was so worried I couldn't sleep.

138
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:46,230
That's why I wanted to see you.

139
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,420
You must be shy.

140
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,600
Or are you usually pretty quiet?

141
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:01,070
You're really pretty like I've heard.

142
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:04,410
I see why Manager Tak's been hiding you.

143
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,190
You don't put expensive jewelry out in the public.

144
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,060
I agree.

145
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,840
Excuse me, Writer.

146
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,480
You don't have to take it too seriously.

147
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,970
I'm only popular on the internet.

148
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,900
When you see me in real life,

149
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,770
I'm just a regular oppa.

150
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,760
Writer.

151
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,770
I heard you're not re-signing with this company.

152
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,430
I know the president at Books Box really well.

153
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,220
I'll introduce you to him.

154
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,170
So before that, we should eat, no...

155
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:40,530
drink. I know a really cool place.

156
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,490
Why is Team Leader out at this moment?

157
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,900
Should I go and try to intervene nicely?

158
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,170
I think it'll be faster if you're not nice.

159
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,350
Words won't do anything to him.

160
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,690
Why are you all gathered there?

161
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,570
What took you so long?

162
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,380
The meeting got long. What is it?

163
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:05,370
Writer Ji Jo King called Writer Lee Hyeon to say that she plagiarized his work—

164
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,100
Every word you say is ******.

165
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,220
- W-what? 
 - Am I easy for you?

166
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,910
Have we ever met? We've met for the first time today. How dare you want me to call you oppa?!

167
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,690
Are you crazy?

168
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,700
I'm totally fine.

169
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,040
If I'm crazy, would I have thrown your laptop? I would've ripped your mouth first.

170
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,040
What the heck? Drag this crazy bitch out right now.

171
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,410
A crazy bitch?!

172
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,360
- Writer, please calm down. 
 - Hey!

173
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,190
- Writer... 
 - Come down.

174
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:55,560
Consider yourself lucky today.

175
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,880
Making me mad over something like this...

176
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:03,270
I can see why you keep failing every single work you write.

177
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:06,360
Nothing good could come out from a writer like that.

178
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,260
You bastard.

179
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,850
That must be why your work is always like that.

180
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,160
What?

181
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,180
What's wrong with my work?

182
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,580
How should I say it?

183
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,580
Your words are pretty ugly.

184
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,910
Team Leader Cha!

185
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,690
Whose side are you on?

186
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,740
The winner's side.

187
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,620
I'm sorry. I can't really hold in for things like this.

188
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,740
Hey, call the police.

189
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,960
Call the police!

190
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,980
How about we wrap it up by replacing his laptop?

191
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,980
Wrap it up? Wrap what up?

192
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,860
Call the police. Call the police!

193
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,620
Why would I have to replace it?

194
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,590
Hey, call the police? Anybody hear me?

195
00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:00,020
You can go. That laptop is mine.

196
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,900
Excuse me?

197
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,430
Yes.

198
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,990
Seriously, you're too much, too much.

199
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,870
We should see each other in an open space.

200
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,130
Do you think it would be safer if it's open?

201
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,970
Then I can run away.

202
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,710
You think you can get away from Doom?

203
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,750
Actually, you might chase me to death.

204
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,880
That's what I'm good at.

205
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,210
- The moon's pretty. 
 - You're prettier.

206
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,590
Seriously!

207
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,040
What?

208
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,560
You should think before you say things.

209
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,630
Why should I think? I know when I see pretty things.

210
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,630
Gosh.

211
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,610
Is your garden still like that?

212
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,350
Still like what?

213
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,160
Is it still lonely and sad?

214
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,080
No.

215
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,020
You came in.

216
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,030
I think that's when it started.

217
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,040
What started?

218
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,020
That look is prohibited.

219
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,870
I think it started then, too.

220
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,530
What started?

221
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,810
Feeling pain when thinking about you, finding you pitiful, and

222
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,850
feeling like something is stuck here. Things like that.

223
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,330
Who calls who pitiful?

224
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,920
That look is also prohibited.

225
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,740
What is "that look"?

226
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,580
Sad look.

227
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,660
Since the moonlight is so nice, should we kiss?

228
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,550
What?

229
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,390
Just kidding.

230
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:32,990
- By the way, is that ceramic really expensive? 
 - Yes.

231
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,710
Dang, how much was it?

232
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,490
- Just kidding. 
 - What?

233
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:43,700
It feels really weird that you're walking me like this.

234
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,300
I walked you often.

235
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,590
It's different now.

236
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:50,460
Oh, is it because I'm your boyfriend now?

237
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:54,110
You really only pay attention to certain words.

238
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,660
And you only pay attention to certain words?

239
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:03,230
Then should I be saying something like this at this moment?

240
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:12,280
Would you like to come in for some ramen?

241
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,600
I don't eat nor sleep.

242
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,220
Jeez! That's not what I meant!

243
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,680
You would be in trouble if I was serious.

244
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,380
You're really a scary kid.

245
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,600
Hey, where did you learn all this?

246
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,950
From you guys. It's been a while since I kept my eyes on you guys.

247
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,320
Where are you going? Why are you going in?

248
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,390
You said we'll eat some ramen.

249
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,900
Huh?

250
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,500
Wow...

251
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,980
What are you doing?

252
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,640
Would you like some pork bellies?

253
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,440
There.

254
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,140
Do we really have to eat like this?

255
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,140
It'll stink up the whole house if we didn't.

256
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,170
You want to sleep smelling pork bellies?

257
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,030
Just eat.

258
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,890
Say "ah."

259
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:30,360
Please help yourself, Doctor.

260
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,550
Please eat plenty. "Ah."

261
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,990
This is so good.

262
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,460
What is it, Auntie?

263
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,800
Kevin must want to have a drink with your boyfriend.

264
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,970
Kevin, this is...

265
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,160
Come to think of it, I never asked your name.

266
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,160
What's your name?

267
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,410
- His name is— 
 - Sa Ram.

268
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,670
Kim Sa Ram.

269
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,900
What kind of name is that?

270
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,640
I know.

271
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,130
This is...

272
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,660
Sa Ram.

273
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,820
Boyfriend.

274
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,020
You know there is an old saying.

275
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:26,140
"Only alcohol can reveal the real you."

276
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,860
What did Uncle say?

277
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:32,050
He said you know men when they're drunk.

278
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,540
Uncle!

279
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,250
I... Me...

280
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,720
did all that before. It's good.

281
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,730
The end. Understand?

282
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,350
Kevin.

283
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,460
I should've learned English.

284
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,780
But my studies weren't great.

285
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,820
I got some beer. I should go get them.

286
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,700
- I'll get them. 
 - You don't even drink. Just stay there.

287
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,010
The opener is...

288
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,250
Where is it?

289
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,090
Seriously.

290
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:47,260
 This looks good. This is good.

291
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,240
What's taking her so long? Is she looking for something?

292
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,950
 We should just eat with this.

293
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,750
What about Auntie?

294
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,640
She'll be out soon.

295
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,100
This is good.

296
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,670
Meat is the best with beer.

297
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,660
Beer!

298
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,100
I love it!

299
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,050
This is all cooked.

300
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,850
Should we have some somek? 
  (Soju and beer mixed together)

301
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,030
- Yes. 
 - Somek! Somek!

302
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,920
Beer and soju, soju, soju.

303
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,290
Soju!

304
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,120
Here, here.

305
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:17,360
Real soju! Yes!

306
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:35,910
Thanks for going along even though you don't eat or sleep.

307
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,190
Tell me.

308
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:43,510
What? Say thank you?

309
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,430
I just told you.

310
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,620
Not that. Your feelings.

311
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,440
I won't know if you don't tell.

312
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,320
Your feelings can't be heard or seen.

313
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,890
That's how feelings are.

314
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:03,030
- That's why you should tell me. 
 - What is it that you want to hear?

315
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,770
I love you.

316
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,710
Is that hard?

317
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,440
Then let's start with something easier.

318
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,000
How unwell you are. How sad you are.

319
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,580
How much you want to live.

320
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:46,590
How much you're scared.

321
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,550
You should go by yourself from here.

322
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,000
- Sit. Let's talk. 
 - I told Ji Na

323
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:46,290
- to go out with me. 
 - I told you that day to speak upstairs.

324
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:49,000
I told you that day that I had somewhere to be.

325
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:00,510
It's true that I didn't tell you.

326
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:05,480
I didn't think it was necessary and I thought nothing good would happen if you met.

327
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,770
I was out of line.

328
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,920
Is that all?

329
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,200
Sleep. I'm going to sleep.

330
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:46,130
 Right. You told me you have something to tell me. What is it?

331
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:02,570
 Bucket List]

332
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:06,920
 - What are you doing, Tak Dong Kyeong? Come eat.  
 - Okay.

333
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,960
- Are you going somewhere? 
 - Yeah.

334
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,940
Wow, Auntie's rolled eggs.

335
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,370
Where is Uncle? Did he go back to the hotel?

336
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:29,190
Yeah, it's a little uncomfortable to stay here together.

337
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:33,300
- Where are you going? 
 - Just to meet someone.

338
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,760
Are you looking for me?

339
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:59,090
What is that?

340
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:04,450
I thought you might need it.

341
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,650
I...

342
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,510
have always resented God.

343
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:43,670
But the one I've been resenting is so small and fragile.

344
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,500
I never knew

345
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:54,150
that God had to live with the world on her tiny shoulders.

346
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:05,050
I really hear many things I've been wanting to hear lately.

347
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:16,720
That's all. I wanted to tell you for the last time.

348
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,590
You are always the only one who can help yourself.

349
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:35,050
Love him. Love all that you want and live.

350
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:40,910
He was born for you anyway.

351
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:46,480
I made him for humans.

352
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:59,090
Thanks for the present, Unni.

353
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:17,240
Editor.

354
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,840
I know what you're going to tell me.

355
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,970
I don't think so.

356
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,660
I...

357
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,250
am getting married.

358
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,980
Excuse me?

359
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:55,070

360
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:57,650
It's in three months.

361
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:03,630
Please come. Please. That's what I wanted to ask you.

362
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,860
I don't have friends.

363
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,020
Right...

364
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,860
You didn't know this was what I was going to say, right?

365
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:19,630
See? I said you wouldn't know.

366
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,110
Are you getting married?

367
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,840
What? Why are you here?

368
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,590
- With what jerk? 
 - What?

369
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,960
Isn't that a wedding invitation?

370
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,300
Oh...

371
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,520

372
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:46,920
Thankfully the bride isn't Tak Dong Kyeong.

373
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,280
But why are you here? Are you following me around?

374
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,740
You must've forgotten, but this place is where Doom happens all the time.

375
00:31:54,740 --> 00:32:00,260
Before you appeared, this place was my perfect resting and hiding spot.

376
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:04,930
To be hiding, your face is too noticeable.

377
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,590
Only to you.

378
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:13,780
- Why are you following me? 
 - I'm not.

379
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:18,060
- What do you mean? 
 - I'm not following you.

380
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,700
- Are you really going? 
 - Yes.

381
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,750
- I'm not following but we're going together. 
 - Why?

382
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:26,110
Because I want to be with you all the time.

383
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,250
You're really good at saying those things.

384
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:32,330
- Thanks for the compliment. 
 - It wasn't.

385
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:35,130
- You like it. 
 - No, I don't.

386
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:52,760
- Manager Jo. 
 - You want to go on a blind date?

387
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,760
- What? 
 - That's what I regretted the most.

388
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,010
You gave us plenty of signals.

389
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:04,160
I, the editor who edits novels, didn't get those.

390
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:12,740
- Ye Ji... 
 - You asked me once, what I would wish for, if someone granted one before dying. Right?

391
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,430
 You know... since the topic of a wish came up...

392
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:19,810
 If somebody says that they'll grant you a wish before you die, what would you wish for?

393
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:25,520
I told you money back then, but I want to change it to your health.

394
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:30,270
I will use my wish for your health.

395
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,950
I'm sorry.

396
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:38,410
This is first time for me, too.

397
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:42,250
I didn't know how to put it into words.

398
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,800
So I didn't know when to say it.

399
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,090
It's the first time for me, too.

400
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:50,950
So I'm not sure if I'm giving you the right answers.

401
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,100
Am I trembling?

402
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:58,390
Our Manager Jo always gives the right answers.

403
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:03,180
Without Manager Tak, we have too many overtimes and the CEO is a pain.

404
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:06,930
And the team leader is so rude.

405
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:09,270
The company is a social evil.

406
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:15,170
By the way, who is that guy that's been staring at us from back there?

407
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:26,050
- My boyfriend. Pretend he's not there. 
 - What? Boyfriend?

408
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,960
- Manager! 
 - You're here.

409
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:35,050
- What took you so long? 
 - The CEO asked us to get floss from the store.

410
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:37,940
- We had to go get it. 
 - He's still the same, huh?

411
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,370
Manager, are you okay?

412
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,530
I'm fine.

413
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:46,690
Manager, I really missed you.

414
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:51,600
Stop. Someone is giving you a killer stare.

415
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,960
Sorry?

416
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,290
Who is?

417
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:57,800
I'm not sure. Is he a killer?

418
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,600
- He's her boyfriend. 
 - What?

419
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,510
So, you owe me your life.

420
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:09,030
This is on me.

421
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:14,030
So you're really leaving like this?

422
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,550
No way. When will we see each other again?

423
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:19,520
I'll miss you.

424
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,490
You know to say those things?

425
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:25,580
If I bought you yangjangpi, you would've told me you loved me. 
   (A Chinese dish where fresh vegetables are thinly sliced and neatly placed around a large plate with sautéed noodles, seafood, beef and/or pork placed at the center.)

426
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,550
Whatever that is, I will do that. 
   (A Chinese dish where fresh vegetables are thinly sliced and neatly placed around a large plate with sautéed noodles, seafood, beef and/or pork placed at the center.)

427
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,990
Enough. It's not like we'll never see each other.

428
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:32,430
We'll keep seeing each other.

429
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,900
You're not answering again?

430
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,570
I will see you often. I'm warning you.

431
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:41,810
After you meet all the people you have to and have some leftover time, call me.

432
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:44,220
Do you or do you not understand?

433
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,970
Me, too. Call me, too.

434
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,540
I really—

435
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,820
Aren't you getting in?

436
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,760
I'm coming.

437
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,180
I'll get going.

438
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,980
Just take it easy on work. Don't work your butt off.

439
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,870
Okay?

440
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,690
The boyfriend looks older than I thought.

441
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,310
Huh? Doesn't he look young?

442
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:15,170
He does look young but I think he's a little too short.

443
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:16,580
Isn't he pretty tall?

444
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,070
He is tall.

445
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:20,040
He's short. He's way shorter than me.

446
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,780
He was way taller than you.

447
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,140
Hey, if you keep showing yourself up like that, I can't be with you.

448
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,610
What did I do?

449
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:31,310
You had your eyes like this, like a puppy guarding his owner.

450
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:34,650
A puppy can't guard his owner because he's too little.

451
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,610
You and your words!

452
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:42,050
Hey, hey! Left turn, left turn.

453
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:44,130
You must think this is a taxi sometimes—

454
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,630
I know it's not a taxi.

455
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:49,210
It's my boyfriend's car.

456
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,540
You're really good at saying those things.

457
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,710
Yeah. I learned it from someone.

458
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:09,550
I'm really busy.

459
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:13,560
Why do you keep calling me out? Do you like me?

460
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,340
I didn't "keep" calling you out.

461
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:18,130
Last time, you were the one who came to me.

462
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:20,550
And I'm not the editor anymore.

463
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,770
What is this? A threat?

464
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:26,550
A challenge?

465
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,630
Can I have your autograph?

466
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,640
Editor, do you really like me?

467
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,990
You said you were busy. Hurry.

468
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,810
"To Writer Dalgona."

469
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:51,310
Does Writer Dalgona like me?

470
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,860
Is it that important if someone likes you?

471
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,900
Not important, but I like it.

472
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,260

473
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,330
It's good that you like it.

474
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,610
"P. S.

475
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:06,210
I hope you regain your health, and I hope to see you in your next work."

476
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:08,550
Is she sick?

477
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:12,010
She has cancer.

478
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:15,060
She's about to get surgery.

479
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:19,220
She said that you make her laugh in the midst of sickness and death.

480
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,410
Two hearts.

481
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:31,540

482
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,750
I heard you're sick, too.

483
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,350
Yes.

484
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,290
Two hearts.

485
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:41,250

486
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,490
Three.

487
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,890
Editor, give me your hand.

488
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,500
What is that?

489
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,230
My signature is an amulet.

490
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:03,600
One time, my fan got my autograph and raised her school ranking by 50.

491
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,600
And also got a job.

492
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,370
So you're going to be all right, too.

493
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:14,030
By the way, did you really quit your series because of me? Why?

494
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:18,690
I'm a loyal guy. You bought me so much food.

495
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:22,490
I always pay back for what I get. That's how I am.

496
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:29,230
Tteokbokki is so expensive.

497
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:32,120
It was really good that time, right?

498
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,470
Writer.

499
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:41,210
Yes?

500
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:44,870
I'd like to ask a writer something.

501
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:48,990
If I choose someone I love, the world will be doomed.

502
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:53,970
And to save the world, someone I love dies.

503
00:39:54,670 --> 00:40:00,800
With this set-up, how can you make it a happy ending?

504
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:12,390
If the lead doesn't love anyone, it'll solve everything.

505
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:18,420
It'll be sad for the lead, but that's what the chosen one has to bear.

506
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:27,760
Would it be a happy ending when the lead is sad?

507
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,840
But the others will be happy in the world that the lead saved.

508
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,890
That's how it is for the leads.

509
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:38,300
Who's new work is it?

510
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:44,700
As expected, you deserve to be in the top ten.

511
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,700
So suddenly?

512
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:53,930
By the way, I've been wanting to ask you.

513
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:58,490
Editor, are you dating the tteokbokki place owner?

514
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,850
Sorry?

515
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:04,620
He's been glaring over here.

516
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:10,370
To be exact, since the moment I signed on your hand.

517
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:14,660
Well, yes.

518
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,820
Wow.

519
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:20,710
I didn't know you like handsome guys.

520
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:26,320

521
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,500
I think I have to go. I can tell someone's looking for me.

522
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,880
Thank you, Writer.

523
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,840
If you're thankful, advertise for me.

524
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,930
- I'll get going, Noona.  
 - Noona?

525
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:39,360
You said you're not an editor anymore.

526
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,420
So, Noona.

527
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,230
So immature.

528
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,830
I got long legs.

529
00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:01,380
Why are you here and not doing business? Did you go out of business?

530
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,240
- Just leave quietly. 
 - I don't want to.

531
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,840
I will leave loudly.

532
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,920
Seriously.

533
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,990
What's wrong?

534
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:10,430
He's a kid.

535
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:13,420
He's not just a kid. He's a rude kid.

536
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:16,000
You want to do that with a kid?

537
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,090
Whose side are you on?

538
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:21,210
Of course yours. Let's go.

539
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,790
Are you sure you're on my side?

540
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,650
Aren't you just saying that, so I'll drive you?

541
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:33,890

542
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:37,090
I'm seriously so happy right now.

543
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,950
I'm happy that you're happy.

544
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:44,810
Thank you, Editor. Really.

545
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:48,640
How are you?

546
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,800
Sorry? What do you mean?

547
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,440
Are you happy these days?

548
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:03,770
That time, you looked like that.

549
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:06,200
Just like a person who has happiness right in front.

550
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:11,150
You looked like someone contemplating if she should eat the sweet right in front of her or not.

551
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:13,980
I pushed you so you'd eat it.

552
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:20,190
Writer.

553
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:21,890
Yes.

554
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:26,180
Living...

555
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,980
is so fun for me.

556
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,780
What should I do?

557
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,960
It's...

558
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,890
so fun right now.

559
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:09,790
Hey!

560
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:14,980
Smoking?

561
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,840
You scared me.

562
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,610
You're crazy!

563
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:22,780
This is good for nothing.

564
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,530
What? This is a smoking area.

565
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:27,170
Who cares if it's a smoking area?

566
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:29,080
You're doing everything that's harmful.

567
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,450
It's not like you didn't know.

568
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:33,100
I didn't know. Even if I knew, I don't like it.

569
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,020
Do you want to get married?

570
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:41,210
- What? 
 - We held hands, kissed, and we're dating. Isn't marriage the next step?

571
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:42,790
How does the relationship proceed like that—

572
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:47,240
People get married if they want to live together forever.

573
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,960
Do you want to live with me forever?

574
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,820
I'm not sure about that. But if I think of dying soon,

575
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,450
I want to do it with you.

576
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:12,830
It's like graduating from elementary school then entering college.

577
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:13,820
What does that mean?

578
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,490
It means that you skipped a bunch of steps.

579
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:18,840
There are so many things to do before marriage.

580
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,820
For example?

581
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:24,220
Get in the car.

582
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:32,120

583
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,690
This is my mom and dad.

584
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:37,990
You should meet them before getting married.

585
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:40,550
It's that picture from then.

586
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:42,390
Yeah.

587
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:51,060

588
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:04,370
That's enough. Let's go.

589
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:06,120
Just like that?

590
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,940
Then what?

591
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,360
You should say something.

592
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,480
I've said everything with this.

593
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,730
That can't be heard.

594
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:23,490
It can't be heard even if I said it out loud. Those things, you say it to your heart, anyway.

595
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,460
Hello.

596
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,960
I'm her boyfriend.

597
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,220
I proposed today but got rejected.

598
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,170
What are you doing?

599
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:34,920
Please give me your daughter.

600
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,190
I will make her happy for the rest of her life.

601
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:41,390
You must've seen that from somewhere.

602
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:45,190
- Should I kneel? 
 - You still haven't?

603
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,670
What Dad? No way?

604
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:52,790
Hey, I can't get married without my parents' blessings.

605
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,390
It's sad.

606
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:58,610
What is?  Getting rejected?

607
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:00,620
No.  Just you.

608
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:03,350
Why me?  What about me?

609
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:06,830
Why do you always hold back what you want to say?

610
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:10,970
What are you talking about, hold back?

611
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:14,580
Hey, who else says what's on their mind like I do?

612
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,730
Never mind.  Let's hurry up and go.  The store will be closed soon.

613
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:20,910
Store?  What store?

614
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:34,820
Hurry up and blow.

615
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,120
What are you doing?

616
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,530
Congratulating you on your birthday.

617
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:42,180
You said back then that it was your first time hearing "happy birthday," didn't you?

618
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:46,850
So I thought that you must not have ever received a cake or blown a candle either.

619
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:51,100
I won't sing though.  That's a little embarrassing.

620
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:59,560
Hurry up and blow it.  Your wish.  Make your wish.

621
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:05,430
♫  You, who aren't listening  ♫

622
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:09,100
Happy birthday, including all the other times you weren't able to receive congratulatory greetings.

623
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:13,780
♫  You, who shined brighter in the darkness  ♫

624
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:16,060
Who's going to fulfill my wish?

625
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:18,690
Me?

626
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:22,370
Tell me.  I will fulfill pretty much everything.

627
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:24,860
Except for a marriage.

628
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,680
My wish.

629
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,780
♫  ...my love  ♫

630
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,870
For you to live.

631
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:34,740
♫  I won't regret  ♫

632
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,950
For me to let you live.

633
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:43,540
♫  Even if it's the road that's been decided  ♫

634
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,620
I am already doing that.

635
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,620
♫  My only  ♫

636
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,740
Already,

637
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:54,490
you are letting me live well.

638
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:58,260
♫  ...one who held my hand  ♫

639
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:01,190
♫  All of my love  ♫

640
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:02,940
Then...

641
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,390
♫  All the time  ♫

642
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:10,430
among the things you love, and in the world you love,

643
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:14,440
for you to live smiling, as long as possible.

644
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:19,520
And from time to time,

645
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,610
think of me, too.

646
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:29,820
♫  The feeling that I am walking alone  ♫

647
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:36,980
♫  I become sad.  I think about you  ♫

648
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:42,920
♫  Because perhaps you might come to me  ♫

649
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,920
 Buy presents.

650
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,630
 Thank Unni.

651
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:53,930
 Meet the editorial staff.

652
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:58,200
 Get Park Yeong Eun's signed autograph and give to Dalgona.

653
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:02,230
 Offer birthday congratulations.

654
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:07,050
♫  You, who took my hand  ♫

655
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:11,650
♫  when I was standing at the edge of the cliff  ♫

656
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:17,890
♫  All of my love.  All the time that seemed like a miracle  ♫

657
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:23,690
♫  is so precious  ♫

658
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:27,020
 You were nice to me. As if you're going to disappear.

659
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,040
 People who are nice to me

660
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,350
 always disappears.  It was like that for me.

661
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,960
What is it that you want to say to me?

662
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,780
- What I have to say is— 
 - Ah, that's right.

663
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:50,920
That umbrella outside, did you leave it behind?  The red one.

664
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:56,140
Yes.  The umbrella I gave you before, I didn't lend it to you, but I gave it to you.

665
00:50:56,140 --> 00:51:00,930
I didn't have any intention of getting it back, nor did I think that I would be able to get it back.

666
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:05,320
Since I took what I gave you, I thought I should replace it with something.

667
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:10,550
I thought a ghost had left it.

668
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:14,020
- Would it have? 
 - I am saying it's fortunate that wasn't the case.

669
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,750
Do you even have evidence that I am human?

670
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:18,160
Why are you doing that, scaring me?

671
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:23,710
The laptop...

672
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:25,810
I will compensate for it as quickly as possible.

673
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:29,280
Never mind.  I just did that back then to end the situation.

674
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,590
Ah, if it weren't for that bastard...

675
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:35,510
Ji Jo King, you didn't hear from that bastard since then, have you?

676
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:39,120
What could he even say, when it all happened because he was trying to make a move on you anyway?

677
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,550
Ah, does everyone think I am easy nowadays?

678
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:45,070
This punk, that punk, why is everyone doing this to me?

679
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:47,130
Why?  What did he do?

680
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:50,320
He said he is close to the CEO of some company and that he would arrange a meeting for me—

681
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,020
Not that.

682
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:53,830
Lee Hyeon Kyu.

683
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,030

684
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:06,900
Don't answer it.

685
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,750
Me first.

686
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:12,740
I have something to say.

687
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:19,480

688
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:24,090
I live with Lee Hyeon Kyu and I've known him for quite a long time.

689
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:29,090
Excuse me?

690
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:32,140
Even when we kissed nine years ago.

691
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:58,190
 Oh, Hyung!

692
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:00,640
 Don't you have un umbrella?  Why did you get so wet?

693
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,860
 - Where are you going? 
 - To the convenience store for a bit.

694
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,540
 It's raining hard.  Go later.

695
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:07,290
 I have an umbrella.

696
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:10,920
 Even with an umbrella, you will get wet.  Go when it stops raining.

697
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:20,090

698
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:21,720

699
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:25,440
If I hadn't kissed you that day, you two would have met.

700
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,230
Then, was it on purpose?

701
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:31,430
Because I wished that you would never meet again.

702
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:35,020
Because I was sure that, if I did that, you would never come over there again.

703
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:37,730
I don't regret it.

704
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:40,540
Even if I go back to then, I would make a similar choice.

705
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:43,520
I only make a move when I am certain.

706
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,960
I was certain.  That Lee Hyeon Kyu has to disappear from that person's life,

707
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:51,320
in order for that person to live her own life.

708
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,400
- What do you know that— 
 - Do I have to know, in order to help?

709
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,210
Did you love him because you knew everything?

710
00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:02,210
Did you know from the beginning that he would keep running away like that and love?

711
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,850
I knew it all, yet I still liked him, that trash.

712
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,100
Then, if it weren't for you, Hyeon Kyu and I—

713
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,890
Would you have been happy?

714
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,990
I don't think so.

715
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,950
- Don't you feel apologetic to me? 
 - No, I don't.

716
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:31,510
If you don't feel apologetic, then why are you telling me?

717
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,270
To get myself out of it.

718
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,660
Because, little by little, I am starting to feel apologetic.

719
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,480
Because I don't like that feeling.

720
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:03,650

721
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:05,700
 Parting.

722
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:46,320
 In order to save everyone,

723
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,280
 I must not love them.

724
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:18,290
Are you going somewhere?

725
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,100
You, why are you here...

726
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,370
I asked you if you were going somewhere.

727
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:38,870
Did you know?

728
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:41,230
If I look at you and think, I know.

729
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:45,890
What you are thinking.  What you are feeling.

730
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:59,620
Every moment, your face was that of one parting.

731
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:03,010
Even now.

732
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:04,960
The way you look at me.

733
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,020
That's right.

734
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:19,160
Let's break up.

735
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,150
Let's break up and

736
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:25,430
never meet again.

737
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:29,530
People are like that.

738
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:33,000
When you date and then break up,

739
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,810
you don't see each other again.

740
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:38,700
Let's get married later.

741
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,920
After we survive.

742
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:47,390
At that time, let's hold hands again

743
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:50,010
and kiss,

744
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:51,780
and date,

745
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:55,450
and let's get married.

746
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:03,130
You were going to do this from the beginning, weren't you?  When you said let's date.

747
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:09,480
This is the only way I can save you.

748
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,600
If we break up?

749
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,410
If you leave like that?

750
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:16,520
Do you think you can forget me?

751
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:21,430
I'm going to try.

752
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:24,210
How about Tak Seon Kyeong?

753
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:30,060
How about your aunt? How about Na Ji Na?

754
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:36,820
Can you forget them all?

755
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:39,340
The people you love.

756
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:45,290
That... I will try, too.

757
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:46,290
What if you can't?

758
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:51,490
During the time I have left, I will try my hardest.

759
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:53,960
I also started to love you, too.

760
00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:08,380
I started to love you.

761
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:15,950
I'm sorry. For loving you.

762
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:29,130
Tak Dong Kyeong...

763
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:45,840
I am grateful... for everything.

764
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:49,350
I'll leave now.

765
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:06,320
 To save everyone, to save you,

766
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:10,110
 I have to be lonely.

767
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:01,420

768
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,290

769
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:28,190
 Seon Kyeong!

770
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:29,800
 You'll get hurt at that rate!

771
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:33,460
♫  I'm still here  ♫

772
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:36,990
♫  Do you still remember   ♫

773
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:40,360
♫  the day we first met?  ♫

♫  It feels like I'm walking through a dream with you  ♫

780
01:03:09,530 --> 01:03:11,440
 Gosh, you scared me.

781
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,530
♫  You,  ♫

782
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:17,810
 You don't seem to be from my school. Do you live here?

783
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:21,870
 Nice. Do you know where the closest supermarket is?

01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:36,750
 Talk to me after you let go!

788
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:38,650
 This is the academy? Aish, seriously!

789
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:40,110
 If I don't go, I'll get bullied!

790
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:41,950
 Do you think that makes sense?

791
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:43,950
 Oh, wait!  I hear well from this spot...

792

 It's my treat today. Eat as much as you want.

800
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,480
 - Really? 
 - Yeah.

801
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,190
 From here to there, pick everything!

802
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:20,140
 Then, I want fried pepper or fried seaweed rolls.

803
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:21,790
 Okay. Excuse me!

804
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:24,140
 Can we have fried pepper and fried seaweed rolls?

805
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:26,210
 - And spicy rice cake!
- Okay, I got it.

806
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:28,830
 And one serving of spicy rice cake! And fish cake?

807
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:33,380
 Please give us one serving of fish cake as well!

01:04:51,830 --> 01:04:57,030
♫  I only need you  ♫

813
01:04:57,030 --> 01:05:02,230
♫  In a world that's about to explode  ♫

814
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:05,620
♫  I will protect you   ♫

815
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:09,750
♫  So you don't fall apart  ♫

816
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:17,580
♫  You, don't be anxious  ♫

817
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:21,860
 [5. Wish him a happy birthday\

818
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:25,490

819
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:27,550
♫  You   ♫

820
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:31,430
 But in order to live,

821
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:35,950
 if I have to run away from everything I love,

822
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:39,550
 what is the meaning of that life?

823
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:41,730
♫  I only need you  ♫

824
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:46,330
You can do it...

825
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,920
You can do it.

826
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:54,220
Do you think it'll be less dangerous if you're all out in the open?

827
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:56,660
♫  Because it's only you  ♫

828
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:02,380
Do you think you can run away from me?

829
01:06:03,690 --> 01:06:06,600
- You... 
 - Chasing after you until the brink of death,

830
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,930
that's my specialty.

831
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:12,900
Why are you seriously like this?

832
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:15,450
I told you we should never see each other again.

833
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:19,780
It's 12 o'clock.

834
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:28,460
I told you.

835
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:32,850
If we break up, we will not see each other.

836
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:37,230
No. You didn't say it.

837
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:42,450
You... didn't say anything you were thinking from the inside.

838
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:45,160
You never said it, not even once.

839
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:50,140
From the moment you sat there when you were ten years old,  when you found out you were dying,

840
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:52,330
and when you met me for the first time.

841
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:55,420
When you began to hate me and love me.

842
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:02,950
You didn't speak at any of those times.

843
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:15,830
Tell me. Everything.

844
01:07:18,190 --> 01:07:21,760
Say it, Dong Kyeong.

845
01:07:50,790 --> 01:07:52,980
I want to live...

846
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,230
I really...

847
01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:02,600
really, really want to live...

848
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:08,190
I...

849
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:15,790
With you, Seon Kyeong,

850
01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:21,460
Aunt, and Unni,

851
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:25,190
with people I love,

852
01:08:26,790 --> 01:08:28,890
really...

853
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:33,130
I really, really...

854
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:36,360
really want to live.

855
01:08:46,510 --> 01:08:51,080
I do too. Me too, Tak Dong Kyeong.

856
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:57,680

857
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:03,770
♫  Here with me, when your eyes brush past me  ♫

858
01:09:04,590 --> 01:09:07,540
♫  I stand alone again at that same spot  ♫

859
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:10,980
I want to stay alive.

860
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:14,000
And with you...

861
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,030
♫  Even today   ♫

862
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:18,700
...I want to die together.

863
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:22,750
♫  I still believe  ♫

864
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:31,820
♫  Now it's all for you  ♫

865
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:37,370
♫  While standing in the deep place of my memories  ♫

866
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:42,350
♫  I hear a low sound  ♫

867
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:45,500
♫  It's you  ♫

868
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:51,430
♫  It's you who held onto me  ♫

869
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,970
♫  I wanna be with you  ♫

870
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:02,820
♫  At the end of a tiring day  ♫

871
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:06,520
♫  Without a sound, come to me  ♫

872
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:09,780

873
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:11,920
♫  At the end of this road  ♫

874
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:15,780
 Even if I go back, I will make the same choice.

875
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:19,410
 Meet you, love you,

876
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:23,740
 I'm not afraid anymore. After knowing you, my world changed.

877
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:26,380
 I just told Lee Hyeon Kyu to see each other.

878
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:28,890
 Let's pretend our contract never existed.

879
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:32,050
 We will never run into each other, even because of work.

880
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:33,390
 Aunt!

881
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:35,740
 Dong Kyeong...

882
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:37,470
 What should we do now?

883
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:39,690
 Don't pretend you don't know and tell me something.

884
01:10:39,690 --> 01:10:43,970
 I will help you. You can erase each other from each other's fate.

885
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:47,760
♫  I wanna be with you  ♫

886
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:52,080
♫  My long day   ♫
