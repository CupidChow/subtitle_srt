1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,990

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,680

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,590

4
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,980

5
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:33,800

6
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,900

7
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:59,190

8
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:05,660

9
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,770
 The reason for the disappearance of everything.

10
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,770
 Between the start and finish, the beginning and the end.

11
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,200
 - Is it dangerous? 
 - That's what I am.

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,470
 - Am I going to die? 
 - The finish. The end.

13
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,890
 The god of everything that disappears.

14
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,210
 I wish everything stopped existing. Bring doom upon the world!

15
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,850
 - Hi. 
 - Who are you?

16
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,780
 - Doom. 
 - What do you want?

17
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,370
 We don't have time for this. You're going to die soon. Exactly in 100 days.

18
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:35,120
  I do not fear what I don't see.

19
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:41,490
  The minute I see them, fear becomes real.

20
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,750
♫  Why can't it stop?  ♫

21
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,730
 Stop!  Please stop!

22
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:55,450
 Like that, I took Doom's hand.

23
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,550
 Why is it me? Why on earth does it have to be me?!

24
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,940
 Fate.

25
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,930
 This can't do. Let's live together.

26
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,930
 Okay.

27
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,640
 The terms of the contract are, before I die,

28
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,650
 I need to wish for doom upon the world.

29
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,980
 What are you doing?

30
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,060
 Fear mongering.

31
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,310
 Get out!

32
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,750
 During the contract period of 100 days,

33
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,630
 I will not be in pain.

34
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,860
 I saw you.

35
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,980
 You were crying, right?

36
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,810
 One of my wishes will come true.

37
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,330
 Beings like you seem to pity humans.

38
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,100
 Especially people like me.

39
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,550
 If the contract is broken...

40
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,810
 I was too kind to you for no reason.

41
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,780
 ...the person I love the most

42
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,510
 Hand.  Give me your hand!

43
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,840
 Is that your wish?

44
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,020
 ...at that very moment...

45
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,090
 Then, this is my plan.

46
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,250
 ...will die.

47
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,330
 I plan on loving you.

48
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,650
 Then without losing anything,

49
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,300
 I can live.

50
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,070
 You can't love me. No human has done that before.

51
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,100
 Die!

52
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,990
 Everyone either resents me or wants me,

53
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,870
 but they don't love me.

54
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,970

55
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,010

56
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,740
Your hand...

57
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,570
Let go.  I said let it go!

58
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,770
Hold still.

59
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,320
 What is it?

60
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,280
Don't look.  It's not worth looking at.

61
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,590
 Don't move.  Don't move!

62
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,110
 Die!

63
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,170
I will return...

64
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,220
what I took from you.

65
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,620

66
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,010
I told you.

67
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,520
That you won't be able to love me.

68
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,980
Everyone either resents me or wants me, or...

69
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,520
they are afraid of me.

70
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,520

71
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,080

72
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,250
Are you crazy?!  Why would you with your bare hand...?

73
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,550
It sure healed fast.

74
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,130
What are you?  I am asking you, what are you?

75
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,470
 One, two, three!

76
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,500
 Put him up here, here.

77
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,400
 Move aside, please.

78
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,790
- What about the people who got injured? 
 - People who got injured?

79
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:20,390
You know, the man and the woman who got injured because the patient charged at them.

80
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,430
A man and a woman?

81
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,470
Who?

82
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,570
What?

83
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,290
Excuse me?

84
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,730
Did I say something just now?

85
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,050
You said you wish I would die, didn't you?

86
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,000
You said you can't die, didn't you?

87
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,460
I am asking you, knowing that, why did you do that?!  Have you no fear?

88
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,230
Should I have just let you get stabbed?

89
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,350
Would that have been better and taught you a lesson?

90
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,200
You will die if you get involved not knowing your place, something like that?!

91
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,320
What does it matter if you can't die when blood is gushing out like this?

92
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,750
Every day, with a facial expression that looks like you are dying of pain, if you ask me why I did that, what am I supposed to do?

93
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,870
I did it because you might get hurt, that you might be hurting even more.  Why?

94
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:11,360
- The one who's in pain is not me but— 
 - That's right.  It's me.  You know it well.

95
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,650
So, stop yelling at me.

96
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,870
You are not supposed to get upset at a sick person, just like I am not getting upset at you right now.

97
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,610
Is this not getting upset—

98
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,790
Never mind.  Let's just drop it.

99
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,820
What am I doing playing with words with you now?

100
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,760
I just did it.

101
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,670
I said I just did it.

102
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,850
So, why did you just do it?

103
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,150
You asked me

104
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,770
why do I have to live, didn't you?

105
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,790
I thought about it but there is no reason.  I just want to live.

106
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,360
It's the same as that.  There is no reason.

107
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,970
Without thinking, when I came to my senses, I was in front of you.

108
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,550
That's right.  I got involved, not knowing my place.  Sorry.

109
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,890
If you know, that's good.

110
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,120
But I don't regret it.

111
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:30,190
So you should just thank me as well.

112
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,930
He will die, that guy.

113
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,990
You saw me killing him, too, didn't you?

114
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,970
So,

115
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,460
I am not worthy of you doing something just because.

116
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,250
There must be a reason.

117
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,050
Since you are that kind of being.

118
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,690
Noona!

119
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,180
Hey, Tak Seon Kyeong!

120
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,400
Hey, hey!  Why are you like this suddenly?

121
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,100
It looks like he found out you are dying.

122
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,030
Hey, hey!

123
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,820
Blood!

124
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,490
- What's with the blood?  Has it already gotten to that point?! 
 - No.

125
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,810
Noona!

126
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,870
I am sorry.

127
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,720
I am sorry about everything.

128
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,520
How did you find out?

129
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,260
Is that important?

130
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,230
Is that what's important?

131
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,150
You were covered in blood...

132
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,710
You're at that point.

133
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:09,680
It wasn't mine. It just got on me somehow.

134
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,440
Stop crying already!

135
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,640
How can I stop crying?

136
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,780
You're... You're that.

137
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,940
So how can I stop crying?

138
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,700
What? I'm terminal?

139
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,300
Don't say it like that!

140
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,690
What happened to your leg?

141
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,380
- Hey, right turn, right turn. 
 - I know.

142
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,930
Is my leg important right now?

143
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:47,800
If it could make you fine, I'm okay if I didn't have a leg.

144
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,750
Even if I have to go, your leg is what's important right now.

145
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,560
Since it's bleeding like crazy.

146
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,750
Right. Since it's bleeding like crazy.

147
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:04,680
What do you mean "even if I have to go"? How can you say that?

148
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,870
Let's get you admitted to the hospital. Let's go back.

149
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,590
Let's go back!

150
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,860
You're so noisy, I can't drive.

151
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,210
At this rate, all three of us might die.

152
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:17,920
Stop saying "die", Hyungnim!

153
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,440
Can you do something about him?

154
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,510
- Like what? 
 - Like erasing his memory or—

155
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,160
Is that a wish?

156
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,780
Never mind. Forget it.

157
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,100
I'm the one who should die.

158
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,530
No, don't say die, Tak Seon Kyeong.

159
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,240
Did you know my sister was sick?

160
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,340
Yeah.

161
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,050
Since when?

162
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,920
Since the beginning.

163
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,310
I thought you were someone trying to use my sister.

164
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,570
Hyungnim!

165
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,330
You're really down-to-earth!

166
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,330
Thanks, Brother-in-Law.

167
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,390
Keep calling him "Brother-in-Law".

168
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,470
Okay, I will.

169
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,580
You should move in together. You're allowed to.

170
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:34,050
I will give permission.

171
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,050
Who are you to give permission?

172
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:41,940
I, Tak Seon Kyeong, a supporter of true love.

173
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,630
I know even if you act all tough...

174
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,370
No, we don't have time for this. I'll get going.

175
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,000
I'll leave it to you from here.

176
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,850
Hey, where are you going now?

177
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,110
Noona, just get some sleep for now.

178
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,420
Don't worry about me.

179
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,130
He's the one I should worry about.

180
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,300
Yeah, Sang Geun.

181
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,330
I don't think I can attend the academy with you.

182
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,740
It's nothing serious.

183
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:58,410
I think I should earn money for now.

184
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,470
No.

185
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,180
I'll tell you some other time.

186
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,930
My poor sister.

187
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,470
What do I do?

188
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,070
I'm the breadwinner.

189
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,450
I'm her guardian now.

190
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:37,100

191
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,120
- Welcome— 
 - Are you...

192
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,450
hiring?

193
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,050
Pass.

194
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,890
 I'm at the site.

195
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:06,000
 This afternoon, Gushing Neighborhood murder suspect Kim

196
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,480
 committed suicide at a hospital in Seoul.

197
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,070
 While he was being transferred to a hospital,

198
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,410
 he made a scene injuring himself. He was moved to the OR

199
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,420
 but ended up dying due to excessive blood loss.

200
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,640
 The suspect Kim was on the 23rd...

201
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,080
There isn't a single word about us in the news.

202
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:35,380
You haven't even flipped a single page since earlier.

203
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,080
I was right. You had a reason.

204
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,010
Did you punish him?

205
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,340
Punish?

206
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:55,040
Don't flatter yourself. I have no interest in that.

207
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:00,800
Then it's not your interest, but your fate?

208
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,340
That's so grand.

209
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,690
He just bothered me.

210
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,270
You keep saying things "bother" you.

211
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,890
You told me I bother you, too.

212
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,630
But that guy and I probably aren't the same.

213
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,710
What would be different?

214
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:26,160
I'm not sure. How are we different?

215
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:51,340
♫  Dream-like love, don't you know it yet?  ♫

216
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,700
Hey, should I wash yours—

217
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,300
♫  When I see you, when we talk  ♫

218
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:16,130
♫  Every single moment  ♫

219
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:20,470
♫  Feels like forever  ♫

220
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:24,280
♫  It makes me stop  ♫

221
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,480
♫  Dream-like love, don't you know how I feel?  ♫

222
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,530
♫  You always change me  ♫

223
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:38,690
♫  I'm happy you're here  ♫

224
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:45,540

225
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,170
♫  Lalalala  ♫

226
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:59,070
♫  I miss you even more today  ♫

227
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,190

228
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:43,680
 Move! Die!

229
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,680
Why did you do that?

230
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,740
Why are you here?

231
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,220
I'm asking you why you did that.

232
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,780
- What? 
 - Why did you protect her?

233
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,190
She did it first.

234
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,690
Since when did you care?

235
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:26,860
I just did it! If she dies there, I can't end the world.

236
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,530
That's a good excuse.

237
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:38,490
I want to know, too. If it's really "just."

238
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,540
Or what her thoughts are.

239
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,530
Then ask.

240
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:50,670
If it's really "just" or not. I'm curious, too.

241
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,180
 If it's really "just" for you or not.

242
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,580
When did you come?

243
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,760
What did you mean by "just"?

244
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,180
- What? 
 - You said you "just" saved me. So what's that "just" mean?

245
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,280
Just is just. What meaning would it have?

246
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,530
It's because if I disappear, you would die. Right?

247
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,730
- Maybe? 
 - As expected.

248
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,330
What do you think?

249
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,000
How would I know?

250
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,810
Because of our contract, I can't hear your thoughts.

251
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,470
Then, why don't you try?

252
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,660
- Try? 
 - Yeah.

253
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,630
Observe and think.

254
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,410
"Why would she do that?"

255
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:05,400
Why do I have to do that?

256
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,690
I do it often.

257
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,730
"Why the heck is he like that?"

258
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,590
"That's why!"

259
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,040
It's an ability a human must have.

260
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:29,070
Oh, maybe you can't do it since you're not human.

261
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,810
How do you do that?

262
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,690
Oh, her. Why do you think she's doing that?

263
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,700
She must be dying to drink.

264
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,250
Because she had to get a lipoma removed from her arm, she couldn't drink for two weeks.

265
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,860
Oh, then she shouldn't do that. She might get an infection,

266
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,520
so she shouldn't drink before she gets better... No!

267
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,020
Hey, don't say what you hear.

268
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,120
You observe and think about it.

269
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,180
What?

270
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,810
I observed and thought.

271
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:24,850
Answer. You're annoyed because of me.

272
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,520
Oh, answer. You're mad because of me.

273
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:38,520
Good job. Yes, good job.

274
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,350
Hey, Tak Dong Kyeong. What do you mean by that?

275
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:46,860
It's not anything good. You don't really mean "good job."

276
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,870
- By the way, what's your name? 
 - Why are you asking?

277
00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:00,360
So I can call you by your full name when I'm mad.

278
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,110
- I don't have a name. Only humans need such a thing. 
 - Then let it be human (Sa Ram).

279
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,630
How many times do I have to tell you that I'm not human?

280
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:11,120
I mean your name. Let's call you Sa Ram (human).

281
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,180
What should your last name be? Let's just make it Kim.

282
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,960
Kim's the most common. Kim Sa Ram.

283
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,450
That's nice. Kim Sa Ram.

284
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,540
What the heck?

285
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,730
Hey, Kim Sa Ram!

286
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,580
You almost got hit.

287
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:58,800
You should look around and let me go.

288
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,190
I really don't get it.

289
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,960
Okay.

290
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,280
- What? 
 - You told me to observe and think.

291
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,320
I'll observe and think.

292
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,600
You're the one who told me to.

293
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:33,420
So... he is Jeong Min?

294
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:37,580
Of course, he's Jeong Min. He's not Joo Ik.

295
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,790
Right, he is Jeong Min.

296
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:44,420
He is Jeong Min. I'm sure. Wow, it's Jeong Min.

297
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,330
Jeong Min, this is the printed material for the meeting.

298
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,850
Please arrange it and set it in the conference room.

299
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,810
Are you nuts? Why are you here?

300
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:57,660
How about Jeong Min? Where is he right now?

301
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,360
Don't worry. He's alive.

302
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,950
Are you serious?

303
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,530
Yes, I'm coming!

304
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,990
You know how to do this, right?

305
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,860
I don't.

306
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,440
Just kidding.

307
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,660
If Writer Kwi Gong Ja causes trouble again, we can't afford it.

308
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:43,230
It's a big event we barely got with the platform, so make sure you do well.

309
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,280
Yes, Sir.

310
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,050
And did you meet Writer Lee Hyeon?

311
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:50,600
- Sorry? 
 - Did you see her after that?

312
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,720
What do you mean by "after that"?

313
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,370
After we talked about the kissing incident.

314
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,400
No, I haven't met her since.

315
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,050
Also, I'm not the type to go around talking about that kind of stuff.

316
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:02,700
- Why not? 
 - Excuse me?

317
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:07,270
Organize all her work, from synopsis to account settlement by today and hand them to me.

318
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:10,020
- Why so suddenly? 
 - That's all.

319
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,420

320
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,450
- Are you dating Jeong Min? 
 - Me? Why?

321
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:19,820
No, right? Then, did you do something wrong to him?

322
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,120
- Sorry? 
 - He's been staring at you.

323
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,090
Seriously!

324
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:58,220
I'm bleeding doing that.

325
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:03,710
You did something so extremely dangerous.

326
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:08,150
Is your finger the meeting material?

327
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,640
All good.

328
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,420
- Why do you stick that? 
 - Because you're bleeding.

329
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:23,250
It probably got all healed up while you were sticking that.

330
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,310
Wouldn't I know that?

331
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,190
This is just a consolation.

332
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:31,240
It's something saying like "Oh, that must've hurt."

333
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,970
You said "just" again.

334
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:50,510
Tak Dong!

335
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,300
Manager.

336
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,560
What is it again?

337
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,260
How do I do this?

338
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,150
- What is "this"? 
 - Printing.

339
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:10,100
Why are you here when you don't even know how to do this?

340
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,510
- Would I really not know? 
 - What?

341
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,890
I "just" did it, too.

342
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,490
No. We're not.

343
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:32,090
We're not. Never!

344
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:36,090
Nothing like that. No.

345
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,520
It's not.

346
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,220
 Welcome.

347
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,820
Team Leader, sit here, please.

348
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,400
I'm more comfortable here.

349
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,950
Then please sit here.

350
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:09,020
- Let's just sit. 
 - Yes, sir.

351
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,550
Jjamppong or Jjajang? That's the question.

352
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,090
I need to sober up, so jjamppong for me.

353
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,400
At this rate, you're drinking to eat jjamppong.

354
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,930
- Fried rice for me. 
 -  Me, too.

355
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,800
- I'll take japchae rice. 
 - Me, too.

356
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:43,130
Gosh, I can't even talk.

357
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:46,780
I told you to observe and think,  but not like that.

358
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:50,110
Even a kindergartner wouldn't do that.

359
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,560
Are you coming tomorrow, too?

360
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,760
No. I'm not coming tomorrow.

361
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,910
What is it?

362
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:02,250
This person here is getting off here.

363
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,020
Really?

364
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:09,060
 This stop is Vex, Vex.

365
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,800
 The door on the left will be opening.

366
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,300
 The doors are opening.

367
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,380
This is the first time ever I'm going home sitting down since I started working.

368
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:30,050
I observed and thought.

369
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:34,530
You looked tired and I thought you'd want to sit.

370
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,480
That's so touching.

371
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,570
You're really almost a human.

372
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,500
Is there going to be any other ones?

373
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,550
There is.

374
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,420
Then hurry and go sit. What are you waiting?

375
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,910
- I don't need to. 
 - Why not?

376
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,470
Because I have to look at you from here.

377
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,720
Go ahead then.

378
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,790
I also have something to look at.

379
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:33,200
I'm looking at you.

380
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,990

381
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:44,320

382
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,950

383
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,940
 It's really good. Please continue to write more.

384
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,580

385
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,160

386
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,020

387
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,670
Why are you smiling?

388
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:09,430
Hmm? It's nothing.

389
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:12,030
Is it funny that the story doesn't continue?

390
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,510
What do you mean?

391
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,780
He says the story doesn't continue.

392
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,900

393
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,120

394
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,330

395
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:37,570
I did not see that.

396
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,780
I did not hear that.

397
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,300
I'm going home.

398
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,190
I'm off work.

399
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,210
Whatever.

400
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:50,680
Something must be really wrong.

401
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:00,120
 It's really good. Please continue to write more.

402
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:03,160

403
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,810

404
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:24,520
 It's so interesting. I'll look forward to the next episode.

405
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:30,440
 As expected from you. Please continue to write more.

406
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,940

407
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:39,180
 I liked it because it was different, but as time goes by, all the male leads seem to be the same.

408
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,840
 I don't think she cares. I can't read anymore.

409
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,890
 I'm quitting.

410
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:49,260
 That's why you're like this, huh?

411
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,710
 Because he's the model.

412
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:57,390
Lee Hyeon Kyu, I'm getting revenge.

413
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,680

414
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:14,460
 "I'm getting revenge."

415
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:21,480
Why are you home so early?

416
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:26,650
There are two ways to not run into employees. Either I get off work first or last.

417
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:29,040
Just tell them you're the son of the landlord.

418
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,720
- I don't want to. 
 - Why not?

419
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,930
I'm not working because I don't want to work but I don't want to be seen as not working because I'm rich.

420
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:40,820
Have you seen the new part-timer? He's handsome, right?

421
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,700
Wash your hands first.

422
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:46,930
They're clean. These hands wash dishes a zillion times a day.

423
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,490
Fine. I will.

424
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:58,570
Have you seen the part-timer?!

425
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,390
No, I haven't.

426
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,630
Hyung, don't you care about me?

427
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:06,740
When have I ever cared about you?

428
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,630
You've changed.

429
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:15,190
What are you looking at rather than me?

430
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,900
What is this?

431
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,060
"He ended up running away from people and embarrassment."

432
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,600
"That was his way of saying goodbye."?

433
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,760
 "Fine. Let's break up."

434
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,410
The guy is trash.

435
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:34,980
Why would she not let go and cry over him?

436
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,620
I know. I wonder what was so great?

437
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,000

438
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,840

439
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,480

440
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,250

441
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,990

442
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,310

443
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:07,660
 Who is it?!

444
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,800
 Kwi Gong Ja said he's quitting the series.

445
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,170
 If he quits, then how do we make a living?

446
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,150
 How many top writers do we have? How can you not manage?

447
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:19,340
 I was gone for a little bit and look what happens at the company. Who was it?

448
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:23,060
 Who uploaded like that?

449
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:26,400
 Why won't you speak?

450
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,390
 Do you both want to be fired together? Do you think I can't do that?

451
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,820
 Park Jeong Min, you just looked away!

452
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:38,620
 Kim Da In! Was it you?

453
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:42,550
No, it was me.

454
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,840
 Tak...

455
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,380
- I'm sorry. 
  - Sorry won't do!

456
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:51,030
 I had to talk with his mom this early!

457
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,630
 International calls are so expensive!

458
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,790
 Do you know how scary his mom is?

459
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:59,380
 You have to make sure you persuade him. If you can't, then quit.

460
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,730
I will.

461
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:04,780
 Hey, where are you going?

462
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,790
To write my resignation letter.

463
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,000
 Are you kidding me?

464
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,520
 Go get Kwi Gong Ja right now!

465
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,660
That's too bad. I could've quit.

466
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,750
I'm sorry, Manager.

467
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:27,520
- I will take responsibility— 
 - How will you take responsibility?

468
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:33,800
It's all my fault. I shouldn't have ignored it.

469
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,710
- Sorry? 
 - Never mind.

470
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:38,570
Everybody learns from mistakes.

471
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:41,330
I learned like that too.

472
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:43,590
Making mistakes.

473
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,600
I'm not writing.

474
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,220
You came to ask me that, right?

475
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:04,050
Aside from that, I was thinking about stopping anyway.

476
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,410
I'm off.

477
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,560
Today's lunch is tonkatsu.

478
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,910
Writer!

479
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:17,520
You've come all the way here during your busy schedule, I can't let you go like this.

480
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,620
I...

481
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:27,390
Exactly. I wrote during my busy schedule and you can't upload like that.

482
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,130
I'm offended.

483
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:36,160
I really don't have any words to say.

484
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,080
How about we eat and have a little,

485
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,490
a very little conversation?

486
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,990
It won't take too long.

487
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:47,430
To buy you something yummy,

488
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,950
tada! This is called a corporate credit card.

489
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:54,080
- A corporate credit card is— 
 - I know what that is!

490
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,550
Exactly.

491
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:00,850
I babbled too much.

492
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,500
Can I eat something expensive?

493
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,900
Of course. Just tell me what you want.

494
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,020
Then I want...

495
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,380
Yup Dduk. 
  (A famous korean rice cake chain)

496
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,430
Sure.

497
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,520
Welcome.

498
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,880
Hey! You...

499
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,020
Sorry? Me?

500
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:46,040
It smells so yummy, right, Writer?

501
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,750
After I eat, I'm leaving school early.

502
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,650
I'm not going back to class.

503
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,030
We'll take one tteokbokki and—

504
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:03,460
Add udon, double cheese, assorted tempura, minus veggie tempura, and change that to kimbap, please.

505
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,950
Super spicy, please.

506
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,700
Yeah.

507
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,050
Yeah?

508
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:15,110
That person just said "yeah," right?

509
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:18,390
No! I think he said "yes."

510
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:50,460
What if I make a mess out of the ending? Like the Earth explodes.

511
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,280
That's on a big scale and a great idea.

512
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,610
Suddenly, the main characters die–

513
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:59,080
Sad ending. It's an ending that will be remembered for a long time.

514
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,200
After everything, they find out it's just a dream.

515
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,990
Inception of the web novel world.

516
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,310
But you...

517
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,820
Yes?

518
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,740
It's strange.

519
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,580
What is?

520
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,300
Why is there no sausage here?

521
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,270
Sausage?

522
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:28,960
Sausage, it's here!

523
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:36,340
Anyway, it's not something that can be easily discussed like that.

524
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:40,010
Editor, you're not a writer, so you won't know.

525
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:46,370
Of course. To be honest, editors and whatnot, you don't need them.

526
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,750
I just really like your novels.

527
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,000
They're so fun and I want to see more.

528
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,880
It's just my personal ambition.

529
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,510
You can't tell the CEO that I told you this, okay?

530
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,900
Can I add more sausage?

531
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,250
Yes, of course! You can add anything you want here.

532
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,270
Over here!

533
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:09,020
Can we add more sausage and cheese?

534
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,830
We don't have any.

535
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,860
- Then, more dumplings! 
 - We don't have them either.

536
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,800
- Then, how about quail eggs? 
 - I don't have them.

537
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,710
Why do you not have anything?

538
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,550
Isn't this place very rude?

539
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,080
Sausage...

540
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,090
Quail egg... If they don't have them, I'll go get some eggs baked in an elvan stove.

541
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:28,500
I saw that there is a convenience store next door.

542
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,760
Just wait a moment.

543
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,560
I can do that, right, Boss?

544
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:01,110
Hey. You're so young, yet why are you so rude?

545
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,990
You only want sausage.

546
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:06,110
Oh, yes. It must be nice to be old.

547
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:07,080
You don't like sausage?

548
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,270
This little kid keeps talking back to me.

549
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:12,540
You're all grown up, yet picking fights everywhere.

550
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,720
Do you want to die?

551
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,220
No. I don't want to die.

552
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,190
That Noona will pay for it.

553
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,480
Hey! What is this? Where did the writer go?

554
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:02,760
 Writer, did you go home safely?

555
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:07,060
 I'm worried that I may have taken too much of your time.

556
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:09,350
 I'm sincerely sorry about what happened today,

557
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:14,230
 and I'll be grateful if you reconsider one more time what I told you today.

558
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:18,910
 Then, I look forward to an optimistic response from you, Writer.

559
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:26,930
 I got it, so stop texting me.

560
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,200
 I'm doing a face mask right now.

561
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,580
Seriously, this bastard who was born yesterday...

562
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,410
You should've been like that earlier.

563
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,610
Do you know how to function in the real world?

564
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:42,070
It seemed like prison life instead. Is he a prison guard?

565
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:45,860
Something like that. It's so stuffy.

566
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:48,700
Hey, but since when did you start following me?

567
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,290
Is it from the rice cake store? Or–

568
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:52,850
From the moment you were born.

569
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,840
I follow humans from the moment they are born.

570
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,370
You just caught on now.

571
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:08,650
I was done with public observation,

572
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:14,860
and came to do a private observation, but I ended up doing a public observation again.

573
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:17,000
What did you conclude after your public observation?

574
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,560
Since you witnessed it, you need to think.

575
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,230
How about you just make a wish to get money?

576
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:27,460
If you came up with that kind of conclusion, no thanks.

577
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,630
I'm going to use it for something really, really good.

578
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:32,470
Even if it's cheap and dirty, what can I do?

579
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:34,590
It's not like I'm the only person living like this.

580
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:35,990
Does everyone live like that?

581
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:41,060
Everyone's like that. They all have their own circumstances.

582
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:42,620
As much as you?

583
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:45,060
I don't know if it's as much as me.

584
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:47,320
But all according to their duty they have to fulfill.

585
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,860
All according to the weight they have to pull.

586
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:05,690
What is this?

587
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:09,420
It looks like your duty is too heavy.

588
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:18,760
It seems like you would want this.

589
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:41,770
What the? This isn't a dream?

590
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:45,200
It's real. Be careful so you don't drown.

591
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,770
It's real?

592
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:07,960
It feels like I can live now.

593
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:15,660
I'm telling you for the first time.

594
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:20,290
Whenever I wanted to cry, I always sat here like this every day.

595
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:22,590
Since I was young.

596
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:29,760
I would come when I missed my mom, and when I missed my dad.

597
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,830
I'd also come when Seon Kyeong caused trouble.

598
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:37,760
I'd come when I felt sorry for my aunt, and come here for no particular reason.

599
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,420
Why?

600
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:45,250
You could just cry. Why did you sit here and hold it in?

601
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:47,430
You're right.

602
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:51,520
I just didn't want anyone to know that I was crying.

603
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:55,300
You can cry alone when nobody is looking.

604
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,270
Then nobody would know.

605
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:59,350
I know.

606
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:04,880
I know. I don't like that.

607
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,890
But why are you suddenly so nice to me?

608
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:33,060
So I can seduce you.

609
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,550
Just kidding.

610
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:44,790
♫  Dream-like love, don't you know it yet?  ♫

611
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:03,900
♫  When I see you, when we talk  ♫

612
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:08,020
Do you want to kiss?

613
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:12,290
♫  Feels like forever  ♫

614
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:16,210
♫  It makes me stop  ♫

615
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:21,150
♫  Dream-like love, don't you know how I feel?  ♫

616
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:26,220
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.

617
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:33,560
♫  I'm happy you're here  ♫

618
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,120
Let's go, it's cold.

619
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:46,600
♫  Even more today...   ♫

620
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:56,290
It's c-cold!

621
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:57,930
Tak Dong Kyeong!

622
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:07,190
What?

623
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:10,120
You're not going to gather the clothes? They're all dry.

624
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:21,050
Whatever, I'm not going to gather them!

625
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:45,210
 I heard that bastard Hyeon Kyu is coming to the reunion.

626
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:48,730
Yeah, make me pretty. Like ten times greater.

627
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:50,690
No, like thirty times.

628
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:52,810
What a loser.

629
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:57,520
He didn't pick up your call because he said he's studying abroad, yet he's coming to the reunion.

630
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,750
Studying my butt. He didn't pick up because he was too busy fooling around.

631
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:01,940
He was able to post pictures frequently on social media.

632
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:04,830
When I think about how he broke up with you through a text,

633
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:07,340
it still makes me angry!

634
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,940
Dog bastard.

635
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,160
I can see the look in your eyes.

636
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,670
That's a great attitude.

637
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:17,860
I will make your hair prettily again today, so just wait.

638
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:29,450

639
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:35,270
- Yes. 
 -  Where are you?

640
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:39,210
- What? 
 - Let's meet. I have something to say.

641
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:41,920
- Did you call the wrong person? 
 - No.

642
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,370
 So let's meet, right now.

643
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:53,120

644
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:56,730

645
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,940
Is the desk going to break by you doing that?

646
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:13,590
Where are you going?

647
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:15,110
Meeting.

648
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:29,250
Look over them. I already finished doing that.

649
00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:32,190
What is this?

650
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,890
A proposal?

651
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:37,620
From your story's content, characterization, story research, and episode organization,

652
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:40,490
the unfolding of the story, and keeping your mental health in check.

653
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,470
I will make you get into the Top 10.

654
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:47,660
If that happens, you need to give me 5% of the manuscript fee as an incentive.

655
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,350
I already made a contract with that company.

656
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:52,220
You are signing a contract with me, 1:1.

657
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:54,590
I decided that there is a possibility.

658
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:57,360
- It's not like getting into the Top 10 is easy as it sounds– 
 - Absolute acceptance.

659
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:01,160
Absolute obedience. Are you prepared to do that? Then it'll be easier.

660
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,440
- How can I trust you – 
 - Did you get your hair done?

661
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,220
What?

662
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:11,980
Yes.

663
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,920
I have a reunion to attend.

664
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,960
Is Lee Hyeon Kyu coming?

665
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:25,310
He probably is. That's why you got your hair done.

666
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:29,680
- Excuse me – 
 - Don't go.

667
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,690
To the reunion.

668
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:34,150
Don't see him.

669
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,160
But even if I say this,

670
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:40,740
you're still going to go see him. Right?

671
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:43,440
That's not something you should care about.

672
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,490
I saw all of your writing, and all you need is one thing.

673
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:50,320
A new male lead.

674
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,450
I will help you.

675
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:57,040
So let go of any regret. That...

676
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,460
is not revenge, it's regret.

677
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:23,420
Are you going somewhere?

678
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:25,230
Yeah, to work.

679
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:27,350
W-Wait.

680
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,690
Why?

681
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,710
Let's go together.

682
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:46,280
Buy haam! 
  (Haam: box of wedding gifts sent by bridegroom to his bride before wedding)

683
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,650
Buy haam!

684
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:53,290
Aigoo, this is so hard! I can't go any further than this!

685
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:57,770
Aigoo, he can't continue on because he's so hungry!

686
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:00,730
What should we do?

687
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:03,780
Don't brag when you're marrying for the first time in your 50s.

688
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,920
Go easy. Here, take this.

689
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,110
Bring the table of drinks and snacks quickly!

690
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:12,080
Bring it quickly!

691
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:15,430
Buy haam!

692
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:24,220
 Buy haam!

693
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:30,360
I never saw people selling haam.

694
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:35,210
This tradition still exists. I only saw it on TV.

695
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:37,370
He's heading towards doom.

696
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:42,280
Not breathing is not the only form of dying.

697
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,180
That's also dying.

698
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:49,220
You can't see things that you were able to see every day.

699
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,680
It's my job to watch over that as well.

700
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:01,170
It's pretty and sad.

701
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:07,320
Transient things are generally beautiful.

702
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:12,730
Do you know what a supernova is?

703
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:20,550
At the moment a star dies, it shines very brightly as it disappears.

704
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:24,590
But that becomes energy for a new star to be born.

705
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:27,080
And it becomes a star again.

706
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,880
Isn't it like that?

707
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,290
That and you.

708
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:41,860
Don't comfort me. It doesn't help.

709
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:58,280
I thought I picked wrong.

710
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,320
I thought I made the wrong choice of picking you.

711
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,130
And that's why it led up to this troublesome state.

712
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:12,490
Do you still think that?

713
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:15,870
No.

714
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,300
I think I picked well.

715
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:23,100
So that led me to conclude this.

716
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:37,060
Love me.

717
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:44,120
If you can love me, do so.

718
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,290
I thought that will be a good method. So,

719
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:04,030
become the first human to ever love me.

720
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:12,520
♫  When I close my eyes  ♫

721
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:17,930
♫  It feels like I'm walking through a dream with you  ♫

722
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:25,370

723
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:32,110
♫  You, don't forget  ♫

724
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:35,730
♫  Just once is enough  ♫

725
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:39,270
♫  Leave it as a memory  ♫

726
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:45,870
♫  You, I'll tell you now  ♫

727
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:49,760
♫  Love you, love you  ♫

728
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,450
♫  I only need you  ♫

729
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:57,360

730
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:01,910
 Crazily... Love.

731
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,960
  I brought them this time. Flowers.

732
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,340
 Sleep with me.

733
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:09,850
 Dear, open your mouth!

734
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:13,060
 Kid or adult, acting like I'm not there!

735
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:16,390
 Then I'll say I want to experience deep love with you.

736
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:19,270
 Isn't that how all romance begins?

737
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:22,430
 You look good together. With that kid.

738
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:23,990
 I have a wish.

739
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:27,480
 I want you to love me.

740
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:33,940
♫  I'll tell you now, Love you love you  ♫
