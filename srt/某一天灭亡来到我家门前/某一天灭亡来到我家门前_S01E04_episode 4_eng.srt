1
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,360

2
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,390

3
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,920

4
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,480

5
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,810

6
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:49,700

7
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,370

8
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,960
 This drama is fiction. All characters, places, institutions, religions, and events that appear are not real.

9
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,010
I plan on loving you.

10
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,250
Then without losing anything,

11
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,740
I can live.

12
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,420
Then let's do it properly.

13
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,140
Until you want to bring doom upon the world for me.

14
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,870
So what? Do you want to kiss?

15
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,090
Where's the kid who pounced recklessly earlier, determined to die?

16
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,290
I won't forget.

17
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,360
I won't forget what happened today.

18
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:17,280
I will for sure not forget and give it back to you.

19
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,680
Which one? That I tried to kill you or save you?

20
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,420
Both.

21
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,440
My key was in here.

22
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,360
Come in.

23
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,510
Or run away.

24
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,450
 Is that your wish?

25
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,950
 I'm asking whether it is.

26
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,870

27
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,260
  I plan on loving you.

28
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,000
What are you doing?

29
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,980
I asked, what are you doing?

30
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,540
I'm laying down the blankets.

31
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,660
Why would you do that over there?

32
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,740
Let's sleep together.

33
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,530
Or did you say you don't sleep?

34
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,090
Then let's just be next to each other. Bring your pillow.

35
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,380
Since earlier, you really are testing my patience.

36
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,240
What? Are you scared? That I will do something to you?

37
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,960
You should be the one scared. In case I do something to you.

38
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,530
I'm not scared.

39
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,330
You can't love me.

40
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,590
No human has done that before.

41
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,660
I can.

42
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,810
Everyone either resents me or wants me, but they don't love me.

43
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,040
I will. Because I have to.

44
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,180
Then come here.

45
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,030
You came in here on your own accord.

46
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,050
Don't regret it.

47
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,370
What's wrong with regretting?

48
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,660
I'm going to die anyway.

49
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,100
Hey.

50
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,530
Hey, are you asleep?

51
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,460
I don't sleep.

52
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,930
What are you thinking?

53
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,300
"Arrogant human."

54
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,770
"Lowly human."

55
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,550
"How dare a small dying creature..."

56
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,490
Those kind of thoughts.

57
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,700
How about you?

58
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,990
"Crazy bitch,

59
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:34,870
what if you actually died earlier while doing that?"

60
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,090
Those kinds of thoughts.

61
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,480
"Your eyes that were looking at me earlier,

62
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,220
they were so cold and scary."

63
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,410
Those kinds of thoughts.

64
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,040
"Even during all this, your back is warm."

65
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,410
Those kinds of thoughts.

66
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,870
 Do you now realize what it means to feel sympathy?

67
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:14,150
 You smile frequently and you pity her, right?

68
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,590
 It'll get worse from here.

69
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,370
 She acts so pretentious.

70
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,070
 Just fail your exam.

71
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,320
 So annoying, so annoying, so annoying!

72
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,550
 I don't want to go to work.

73
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,590
 Group project?

74
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,550
  Ugh, whatever, they will figure it out on their own.

75
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,170
 Is he a crazy bastard? Why is he looking at me?

76
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,510
Sympathy my ass.

77
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,600

78
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,780
We need to prepare for that day.

79
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,350
Doom is right in front of us.

80
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,420
Are you being serious?

81
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,030
What?

82
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,070
Do you actually want the world to end?

83
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,770
The end of the world does not arrive because we want it to,

84
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,060
but because of our sins...

85
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,340
 It has to be over. This world has to end

86
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,450
 for I, the person who was picked, only me, who was chosen,

87
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,770
 can be happy in my next life.

88
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,530
Who told you? That you were chosen?

89
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:05,590
Actually, if that was the case, my work would be easier.

90
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:09,060
It should have been you. You should have been more desperate.

91
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,390
What are you saying–

92
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,780
Should I tell you a secret?

93
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,520
There is no next world. This is it.

94
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,030
That's not true.

95
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:25,450
God has prepared another world for us—

96
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:29,520
What will happen to managers when things to be managed all disappear?

97
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,580
Won't they disappear, too?

98
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,740
That's my bet.

99
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,470

100
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:02,640
 Do you now realize what it means to have sympathy?

101
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,190
 No. Never.

102
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,360
 How to fall in love

103
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,370

104
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:29,640

105
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,500

106
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,460

107
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,920

108
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,920

109
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,210

110
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,240

111
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,230
 I was sitting out for my gym class in high school because I was sick.

112
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,850
 Suddenly a ball came from nowhere.

113
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,180
 The quiet kid in my class stood up and blocked the ball.

114
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,710
 Then he asked, "Are you okay?"

115
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,560
 That's when I fell for him.

116
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,280
 - Wow, really makes my heart flutter. 
 - Awesome.

117
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,040
 Library, by the window, sunshine, clean shirt, a sunbae I knew.

118
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,650
 That did it. He's my current boyfriend.

119
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,920
 The classic. Backing out.

120
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,960
 - Plus parking ticket. 
 - 22 parking ticket.

121
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:21,640
Those kids are so easy. So easy.

122
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:27,090

123
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,410
Writer, where are you right now?

124
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,940
You want to love?

125
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,910
- Name. 
 - Name?

126
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,280
What's his name? Hurry.

127
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,760
Why the name?

128
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,380
Would I ask to fortune-tell? It's to look him up.

129
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,930
Name... Come to think about it, I never asked.

130
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,630
What? You fell in love with someone, you don't even know the name?

131
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,420
I didn't fall in love. I want to fall in love.

132
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,090
That's that. Where did you meet?

133
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,440
Where did we meet? At the hospital?

134
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,100
Hospital? Is he a doctor?

135
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,000
- Probably not. 
 - A patient?

136
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,760
Actually, was it the first time at the funeral home?

137
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,000
Funeral home?

138
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,950
Is he alive?

139
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:34,960
Just tell me the 101 ways to fall in love.

140
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,560
If it worked like that, would that be love?

141
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,630
It's not that easy.

142
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,090
How did you fall in love?

143
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,080
Me?

144
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,430
For me... It was just in a split second.

145
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,320
 Soap scent.

146
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,810
You're so easy.

147
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:49,500
Hey! It's super hard to come across that face, body, smile, and the moment!

148
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,420
It's not easy.

149
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,430
Weirdly among that smelly group, he was the only one that smelled like soap.

150
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,100
Maybe he was the only one who washed up.

151
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,250
So it's a split moment?

152
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,720
Then would I have to wait for that moment?

153
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,220
Can't you make one? I really don't have time.

154
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,670
- Then confess first. 
 - Out of nowhere?

155
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:15,400
The feelings tend to get huge once you spit it out of your mouth.

156
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:20,430
- Is that how it was for you? 
 - Yes, that's how it was for me.

157
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:24,590
I crossed the river of no return. All thanks to you.

158
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,660
Huh? Why do I get in that equation?

159
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,250
Do you remember the day we first met?

160
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,530
When you came on a school trip to Jeju Island?

161
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,430
 Na Ji Na.  Na Ji Na.

162
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,060
 Na Ji Na.  Na Ji Na.

163
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,620
 Just trust me, kids.

164
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,420
 First time we met. That was intense.

165
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,930
 You were the first girl who went over a wall to meet me.

166
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,920
 Gosh, you scared me.

167
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,840
 You don't seem to be from my school.

168
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,090
 Do you live here?

169
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:16,000
 Nice. Do you know where the closest supermarket is?

170
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,290
 Thirty minutes.

171
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,800
 - Thanks. 
 - By car.

172
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,200
 Jeez.

173
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,330
 Is there any liquor stores near by?

174
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,270
 Awesome.

175
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,160
 How much?

176
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,800
 A dollar?

177
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,640
 Such a thief!

178
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,760
 Deal!

179
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:14,330
 Hey, Lee Hyeon Kyu! I have something to tell you.

180
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:20,200
 Lee Hyeon Kyu! Lee Hyeon Kyu, come out!

181
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,870
 - Lee Hyeon Kyu! Lee Hyeon Kyu! 
 - What the heck?

182
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,630
 Lee Hyeon Kyu! I know you're in there.

183
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,260
 Why is Na Ji Na like that?

184
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,830
 She must be crazy.

185
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,100
 Hey.

186
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,670
 I like you.

187
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,660
 Be my boyfriend!

188
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:02,060
 You should date! You should date!

189
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,020
Straight forward female lead.

190
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,600
If we get a runaway male lead, it would be your novel.

191
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,470
It looks that way to you, too?

192
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,460
Why? Is that what Team Leader Cha said?

193
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,460
No. It's just...

194
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,880
How can you forget such a spectacular first love?

195
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,960
It's a given that it'd leave a mark in your life.

196
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,550
It's fine! Don't worry about it.

197
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,470
What does Team Leader Cha know?

198
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:29,700
Right. What does he know?

199
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,260
He was in my dream all the time.

200
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,010
Right, dream.

201
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,600
You should dream.

202
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,780
- Dream? 
 - Think about him a lot before bed.

203
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,070
Do you have his picture? Look in his SNS and look at it before you go to bed.

204
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,400
- It's game over once he's in your dream. 
 - Yeah?

205
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,230
Yeah.

206
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,460
Okay. You saved my life today.

207
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,580
She says life.

208
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,600
Are you betting your life on love?

209
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,960
Who is this guy that makes my Tak just burn up in passion?

210
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,060
Three months. I will tell you everything after exactly three months.

211
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:15,030
- Three months? 
 - Yes, just wait for three months.

212
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,570
I will tell you in person after three months.

213
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:20,260
To you. In a perfect shape.

214
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:25,900
Perfect? You should be in love and in a mess.

215
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:33,200
No matter how much of a mess, I'd be in love. Would I beat you?

216
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,350
So what? I've never even kissed him.

217
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,420
They say the end to one's first love is regret.

218
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,500
Since we're on the subject...

219
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,620
I met the person I had my first kiss with.

220
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,940
Awesome! That guy you don't even know the name of?

221
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,700
When, where, how, why?

222
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:58,160
Don't be too surprised.

223
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,780
What is it?

224
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,610
Cha Joo Ik.

225
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,350
That guy's name is Cha Joo Ik. Team Leader Cha.

226
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,650
Your boss.

227
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,380
What?

228
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,490
That Cha... That Cha Joo...

229
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,170
What? Why?

230
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:12,010
- Nothing. 
 - "What? Why? Nothing." Isn't it an inappropriate answer?

231
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,820
- What is it? 
 - Sorry?

232
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,490
You've been staring at me ever since you got back from the meeting.

233
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,690
I wasn't.

234
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:21,270
I really wasn't.

235
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,230
Fine then.

236
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,810
- Team Leader. 
 - What?

237
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,150
Nothing.

238
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:42,120
- You know, Team Leader. 
 - I don't know.

239
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,100
What?

240
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:57,270
Have you ever ended up loving someone you hated?

241
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,640
No. I did kiss someone I hated.

242
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,600
Why?

243
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,980
I hated her because I pitied her.

244
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,250
And pitying ended up with kissing.

245
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,890
Did I answer your question?

246
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,880
Hmm? What?

247
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,620
Whatever it was.

248
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,620
Yes, you did.

249
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,390
Good.

250
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,560
Still how can he kiss her?

251
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,520
I can hear you. Speak quieter.

252
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,570
Still how can he kiss her?

253
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,870
Speak quieter.

254
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:39,090
Still how can he kiss her?

255
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,350
- Stop speaking. 
 - Yes, sir.

256
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,730
- Go home. 
 - Yes, sir.

257
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,680
Then I will get... going.

258
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,700
Okay.

259
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,750
 Going up.

260
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,460
What's for dinner?

261
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,190
Why are you asking me? It's your turn.

262
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:03,380
That's too bad. I almost had you.

263
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,050

264
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,110
Did you drive my car?

265
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,310
Hmm? No.

266
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,120
You're dead.

267
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,750
Hyung, since we're on the topic...

268
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:29,200
I have a reunion next week. Can I borrow your car?

269
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,590
- Denied. 
 - Come on!

270
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:34,610
It's been a while since I saw them.

271
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:37,990
Please, Hyung!

272
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:40,190
Why do you need my car when you're seeing your classmates?

273
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,820
I told you to stop being pretentious.

274
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,890
Am I being pretentious because I want to?

275
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,820
If I hadn't ate the rice cake you gave me the day before the SAT,

276
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,950
my life wouldn't be tangled up like this.

277
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:59,420
Never mind. I don't think I can go to my reunion, because I'm too shameful.

278
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,090
Take it.

279
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:04,040
Thank you. I love you.

280
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,720
♪ Teacher's grace is so great ♪

281
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,130
How did something like that get into my life?

282
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,730
Just think of it as paying back the tuition fee you got from my dad.

283
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,420
Did I get paid for free?

284
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,820
- Teaching a dimwit like you, I was— 
 - So what?

285
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,420
I didn't get in a college because of you.

286
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,060
What's up with the reunion?

287
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,340
Is your first love going to be there?

288
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,950
Do you even remember what she looks like?

289
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,690
I don't remember.

290
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,800
How can I remember her? It's been so long.

291
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,620
What the heck?

292
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,070
I got a text from the girl I met at the cafe.

293
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,620
I usually separate work and love,

294
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:54,330
but her looks are just too my type to do that.

295
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:57,210
Look. Isn't she pretty?

296
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,430
Right?

297
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,730
I got a call.

298
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,260
Hello?

299
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,920
Yeah. Oh, the reunion?

300
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,430
Yeah. Of course, I'm coming.

301
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,410
Where is it at?

302
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,620

303
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,460

304
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,640

305
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,960
Sure, you don't remember.

306
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,700
 Door on your left will be opening.

307
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:48,590
Excuse me.

308
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,430
No...

309
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,760
What are you?

310
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,500
Me? A handle.

311
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,080
Should I hold your hand to help you?

312
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,630
Why are you like this?

313
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,910
What?

314
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,610
Why are you suddenly acting nice?

315
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,350
Me?

316
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:40,450
So selfish.

317
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:43,930
You suddenly disappear, then suddenly appear.

318
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,900
Are you curious where I've been today?

319
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,500
I'm not.

320
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,290
I went out and heard what people thought.

321
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:53,480
Hey, I told you that's rude—

322
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,360
They're still the same.

323
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:01,030
Everyone thinks they're the best and they're the most pitiful.

324
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:06,100
I knew it, but after confirming it, it became clear.

325
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,530
What is that?

326
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:11,250
You guys still don't deserve it.

327
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,850
So—

328
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,400
So what?

329
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:22,010
I'm not avoiding your fights.

330
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,760
I want to see you throw away everything because you're crazy about me.

331
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,660
- What are you doing? 
 - I'm trying.

332
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,880
Trying what?

333
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,430
How to fall in love with a special being.

334
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,630
- So did you find the answer? 
 - Yes.

335
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:05,530
- What is it? 
 - The looks.

336
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:08,420
You've got to be good-looking.

337
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,300
What did you just mean?

338
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,190
Well, nothing good.

339
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:23,400
- You must've forgotten your first words to me. 
 - Yes, I did forget.

340
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,360
I didn't forget!

341
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,560
Be quiet.

342
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,390
You should stay with me tonight again.

343
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:36,730
As you wish. Should I go or do you want to come over?

344
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:40,390
You come over. To my dream.

345
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:57,090
An unni I know told me that if you see the person in your dream then the game's over.

346
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,270
It sure is a dream.

347
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,410
You must really like this place.

348
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,360
You brought me here though.

349
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,940
Your subconscious chose it though.

350
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,520
Is that right?

351
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,850
I must really be having a hard time.

352
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,800
Okay, let's go for a second round.

353
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,860
- Second round? 
 - Yes.

354
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,400
Where to?

355
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,660
First, to the school.

356
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:31,570
 You know there are those kids at school who seem mysterious and physically weak, right?

357
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:35,740
 With a pale face, you know.  I am in that role.

358
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,250
 Watch out!

359
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,020
Are you all right?

360
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,810
Hey, it's different.

361
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,770
 What is it this time?

362
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,250
 Connecting worldview.

363
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:10,640
 That high school girl is now all grown and followed a sunbae she liked and entered the same university.

364
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,160
 For your information, they met at a church.

365
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,430
 The sunbae is an accompanist for the church choir.

366
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:19,610
 Uh, so it's the "church oppa" feel?

367
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,820
Sunbae,

368
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,400
please drink this first.

369
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,360
Thank you.

370
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,070
Next.

371
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,130
What is it this time?

372
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,870
Reverse.

373
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,600
Okay.

374
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,390
Stop!

375
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,270
This is missing.  Ah.

376
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:14,260
Ah, I can't deal with this.

377
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,330
Uh, same for me.

378
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,160
This won't do.

379
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:22,890
Then, we are done for today?

380
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:29,130
Talk about yourself a little.

381
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,000
In order to love someone, you should know that person's world.

382
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,530
Show me, your world.

383
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,000
My world?

384
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,460
Just as my subconscious world is here,

385
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,220
there must be a subconscious world for you as well.

386
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:53,110
I will say it again, but I am not human.

387
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:56,450
My world probably wouldn't be what you think, either.

388
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,390
But, well...

389
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,730
As you wish.

390
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,380
This is my world.

391
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:29,190
 The reason for the disappearance of everything.

392
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:32,650
 The god of everything that disappears.

393
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,510
 To love things that will disappear when you touch them,

394
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,840
 must be lonely.

395
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,360
 So much so, that you never want to love.

396
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,930
 I think I can understand a little now.

397
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:11,670
 From what you are,

398
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,910
  to running away.

399
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,830
Aren't you going to work?

400
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:21,000
It's the weekend.

401
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,130
Okay.

402
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,800
Yesterday, that dream—

403
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,360
For now, I am going to forgive you.

404
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:38,710
- What? 
 - I forgive you, I said.

405
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,300
Who are you to (forgive me)?

406
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,830
The person who is trying to love you.

407
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:52,260
Love basically starts from forgiveness anyway.

408
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:58,020
What a laugh!  As a mere human, forgive?

409
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,240
That's what I say.

410
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,910
Besides, love basically starts from hate.

411
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:11,070
But then again, you need to hate in order to forgive.

412
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,450
I don't forgive you.

413
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,950
Today is kind of like a truce.

414
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:20,300
I know that you have no one to talk to.

415
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,720
Because it's the same for me.

416
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:32,410
She bothers me more and more.

417
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,560
It's pretty, painted.

418
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,790
As expected, Na Ji Na.

419
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,870
Who...?

420
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,190
I was intimidated for no reason.

421
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,690
What?  Why?

422
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,040
You were intimidated?

423
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,020
Why?  Did you do something wrong?

424
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,560
- Did you have a fight with Hyungnim?
 - "Hyungnim," my foot.

425
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,510
You should have called first.

426
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,330
Why?

427
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:56,540
- Is Hyungnim coming over? 
 - Ah, this...

428
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,700
You normally stay home on weekends.

429
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,000
So I just came.

430
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:05,730
Well, you know...

431
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,850
Can you let me borrow some money?

432
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:11,120
What?  Why?  What kind of trouble did you cause again?

433
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,110
No... No trouble.

434
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,730
I want to attend an academy.

435
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,160
An academy?

436
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,910
I want to get a license.  Personal colorist.

437
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,350
I heard that's big now.

438
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:25,060
Hey, Tak Seon Kyeong, what did you major in?

439
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,700
Leisure sports.  But I have a talent.

440
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:32,140
I was very sensitive to colors when I dressed, even as a child.  You know that as well, right?

441
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,990
If you are going to talk nonsense, leave.  I am tired.

442
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:38,020
Do I have to listen to something like this even on the weekend?

443
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,990
"This kind of talk"?

444
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:43,330
When I sent you to a computer academy, you got into gaming.

445
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,100
When I sent you to a culinary school, you quit saying that you will gain weight.

446
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,240
You said you would learn Jiu Jitsu, but you quit saying that it hurts when you get hit.

447
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,880
You are like that.  You, really...

448
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,550
Are you going to live like this even after I die?

449
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:58,800
If you aren't going to let me borrow, just don't.  Why talk about living and dying and stuff like that?

450
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,130
Never mind.  I am at fault for bringing it up.

451
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:04,930
What would you know?  When you don't even have a dream.

452
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,350
What?

453
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:10,250
Whose fault is it?

454
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,760
Are you saying it's because of me?

455
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,900
Then, whose fault do you think it is, that I live like this without a dream?

456
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:20,690
If you don't like it, then quit your job.  All you have to do is quit, isn't that right?

457
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:23,460
- Why use me as an excuse? 
 - If I quit...

458
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,720
If I quit, with what money do I clean up after you when you cause trouble?

459
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,010
Who asked you to clean up after me?!

460
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:30,330
I will take care of it myself.

461
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,890
Quite frankly, you did it because you wanted to.

462
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,380
- What? 
 - Don't blame me.

463
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,150
Frankly, are you the only orphan?

464
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:39,670
I am an orphan, too.

465
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:42,740
But I have a dream, you know.

466
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,120
I have things I want to do, you know.

467
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,350
Never mind.  What good is it talking to you?

468
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:53,070
How could you understand me when I don't understand you, either?

469
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,610
Never mind.  I will take care of it myself.

470
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,830
I'd rather die than live like you.

471
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:00,120
Hey, what did you say just now?

472
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,250
- Let go!  You told me to leave, didn't you? 
 - Hey!

473
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,060
Hey, let me see.  Are you okay?

474
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,180
Never mind.

475
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,850
Hey!

476
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,560
Love, it seems there isn't much to it.

477
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,140
He was sincere about everything he said.

478
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,860
I am in no mood to deal with you now.

479
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:43,820
Isn't it too much, when you are trying desperately to save him?

480
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,790
It's none of your business.

481
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:50,510
Why?  Are you going to forgive again?

482
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,250
Aren't you mistaken?

483
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:56,120
That the one forgiving is the nicer one.

484
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,500
That being nice is winning.

485
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:05,630
It must have bothered you when I said that.  Sorry, okay?

486
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:09,040
Yes.  You bother me.  You continue to do so.

487
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:12,490
I got it.

488
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:15,510
Let's just stop for today, please.

489
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:18,350
What would happen if I kill him right now?

490
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,300
There are many ways.

491
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,400
I just have to bring one of the dooms out there upon him.

492
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,860
Would you still forgive me when I do that?

493
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,720
Would you be able to love me?

494
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:33,300
Take back what you just said.

495
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,950
Strange.  I am just curious.

496
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,560
I said take it back.

497
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:50,560
Do you know how many stars disappear per second?

498
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:55,130
7.9 billion disappear.  Who are you?

499
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:59,520
Are you better than a star? Tell me.

500
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,600
Why do you need to live?

501
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:08,920
You are just like that.

502
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,260
I want to throw a rock at a calm lake,

503
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:15,080
and you happened to be the rock that was nearest.

504
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,290
A very convenient coincidence.

505
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:24,030
I wish you would die.

506
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,060
You...

507
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,570
I wish you would die.

508
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:32,190
I wish you could experience death.

509
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:34,620
Then, you would know how I feel.

510
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,970
Is that right?

511
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:58,040
If that's your wish.

512
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,440
Try to fulfill it, your wish.

513
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,370
It's not a wish I can fulfill, it seems.

514
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:45,000
If I could, I would have died a long time ago.

515
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,510
If I can't kill you,

516
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,130
I will at least make you miserable.

517
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:57,390
So that you can live miserably forever.

518
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:00,390
Try it, if you can.

519
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:17,880
When you become miserable just by me refusing to hold your hand once.

520
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,620
Hey!

521
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,590
 I caused it, and it's something I have to clean up after.

522
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:17,230
 No one will take responsibility for me.

523
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:22,080
 Not cause it, not try it.

524
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,260
 Stay still.

525
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,560
 Just stay still.

526
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:31,730
 My life was a continuation of staying still.

527
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,530
 I shouldn't have tried.

528
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:43,720
 Not sympathy, nor love.

529
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:51,660
 Human beings are insignificant.

530
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:58,010
 You are no different.

531
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:06,340
 No different.

532
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,830

533
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:17,670
 Therefore, the prosecution

534
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:21,570
 is asking for a sentence of a life imprisonment for the defendant.

535
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:23,110
 That's all.

536
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:25,090
Just execute me.

537
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:28,200
I am telling you to execute me!

538
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,880
Kill me right now!

539
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,940
Defendant!

540
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:37,720
 I am right.  Human beings are still insignificant.

541
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,300
 Give it back!

542
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:45,710
Let go.  I was wrong.  I was wrong!

543
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:47,200
I was wrong!

544
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,030
I said I was wrong!  Kill me!

545
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:52,550
Give it back!

546
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:54,320
 - Kill— 
 - I don't want to.

547
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:16,100

548
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,150

549
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:28,510

550
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,990

551
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:38,150
Hey, you–

552
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:40,310
 This is Seoul Seowoo Hospital.

553
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:43,130
 You are Tak Seon Kyeong's guardian, right?

554
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,410
Taxi!  Taxi!

555
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:02,810
 I remembered that time.

556
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,000
 Hello?

557
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,070
 Are there any adults at home?

558
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:12,350
 Mom and Dad said they'll be home soon.

559
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:15,080
 This is Tak Jong Won and Kang Soo Ah's house, right?

560
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,820
 This is the hospital. There was an accident.

561
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:20,420
 Do you have any adult you can contact?

562
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:22,710
 Hello, kid?

563
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:28,460
 That first moment when my life started to become dreadful.

564
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:31,490
Mister, quickly! Please quickly!

565
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:39,180
That's good, right?

566
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,640
Thank you, Doctor!

567
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,490
Wait a moment.

568
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,640
Because of that bastard...

569
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,890
I want to get that bastard

570
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:02,680
and I will kill him.

571
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:06,920
Let go of me!

572
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,810
Let go!

573
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:11,420
I'm going to kill that bastard!

574
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,460
I need to go get him!

575
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:18,980
I need to go get him, so let go of me!

576
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:27,970
Hey, hey, hey!

577
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:30,850
Hey, call the ambulance right now!

578
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:38,860
Hello.

579
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,160
Excuse me!

580
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,780
Excuse me!

581
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:55,510
W-What are you doing right now?

582
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:59,100
What I'm doing right now?

583
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,760
I'm looking at trees.

584
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,620
Do you see that tree over there? All of its leaves fell.

585
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:11,910
L-L-Let's not be like this; have a conversation.

586
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:15,600
We're both doctors, so we can understand each other well.

587
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,250
W-Which department do you belong in?

588
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,740
Did you lose a patient you were in charge of?

589
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:25,650
Is that why you're like this?

590
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,650
I also went through that.

591
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:31,570
I know how you feel!

592
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:33,680
- You know? 
 - Yes!

593
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,250
The pain that comes with losing a patient! I know that well!

594
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:41,990
So, please come down first and talk with me–

595
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:44,950
The things that died and disappeared because of me,

596
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:47,020
I just keep watching over them like this.

597
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:50,880
Do you do that, too?

598
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,480
Yes! I do that, too!

599
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,290
I still do that!

600
00:53:56,290 --> 00:53:59,650
I know it's hard! You really want to save them.

601
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:02,080
I feel the same!

602
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:07,160
What's the same? I want to end it all.

603
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:11,660
No, no, no, no. Please come down.

604
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:14,420
Please come down!

605
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:16,070
Is that so?

606
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,730
I will go down then.

607
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:24,470
N-No!

608
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,040

609
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,420
Tak Seon Kyeong!

610
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,130
Tak Seon Kyeong, where is he right now?

611
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:54,420
You just need to go inside over there.

612
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,920
 I'm sure Tak Dong Kyeong will be super surprised and come running.

613
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:03,320
 Hundred percent! There's some things she wronged me for, so she must've freaked out!

614
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:06,620
Hey, as soon as I get the money, let's go sign up.

615
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,210
Yes, I'm telling you!

616
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,710
Noona...

617
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:20,680
Noona! Noona!

618
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:25,260
Noona! Hey, Tak Dong Kyeong!

619
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:28,500
Noona! Hey, Tak Dong Kyeong!

620
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:33,230
W-Wait, are you Dong Kyeong's family?

621
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:34,680
What?

622
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:39,330
Yes. I'm her younger brother.

623
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:10,040
Are you following me?

624
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:13,460
No way. I'm very busy.

625
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:17,560
This must be fun for you, pretending to be saving people.

626
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,700
It's not not fun.

627
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,590

628
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:38,540
Move!

629
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:40,610
Die!

630
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,830
 With her current conditions, the longest she'll live is three months.

631
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:20,430
 She needs to get treatment right away.

632
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:45,630
 Somebody, please come outside to help!

633
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:47,560
Your hand...

634
00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:50,960
Let go!

635
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:58,230
Hold still.

636
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,850
Don't look.

637
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:12,470
It's not worth looking at.

638
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:14,200
Don't move! Don't move!

639
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,730
Die!

640
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:17,660
Die!

641
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:35,870
I will return what I took from you.

642
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:58,940
 Please help!

643
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:02,490
I told you.

644
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,920
That you won't be able to love me.

645
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:17,450
Everyone either resents me or wants me, or...

646
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:25,450

647
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:27,330
...they are afraid of me.

648
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:34,820
♫  It’s about to fall off, it's dangerous  ♫

649
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:40,820
♫  I’m sorry, I'm tearing up, yeah  ♫

650
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:48,880
♫ The darkness falls down and disappears  ♫

651
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:53,780
♫  In the frozen time  ♫

652
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:59,490
♫  They’ll disappear without a trace  ♫

653
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:04,100
♫  Why can't it stop?  ♫

654
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:10,120
♫  My last favor  ♫

655
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:17,510
♫  I'm breaking down, falling apart  ♫

656
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:22,670

657
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:24,080
 I want to know, too.

658
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:27,750
 So you should just thank me.

659
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:29,280
 Whether it's really just "just."

660
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,310
 Are you crazy? Why are you here?

661
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:36,760
 Is Lee Hyeon Kyu coming, too? Don't see him.

662
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:39,210
 Since when were you following me?

663
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:41,690
 Would it really go according to your plan?

664
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:44,440
 If somebody says they will grant you a wish before you die, what would you wish for?

665
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,640
 I have a good idea.

666
