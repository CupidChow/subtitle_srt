1
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,750

2
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,480

3
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:28,240

4
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,800

5
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,200

6
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:51,940

7
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,280

8
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,960
 This drama is fictional. All names, places, institutions, religions, and incidents that appear are not real.

9
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,630

10
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,740
I knew you would come.

11
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,840
You endured without coming to see me?

12
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,510
If you hide like that,

13
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,250
did you think I wouldn't be able to find you?

14
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,660
 I can't hold it in.

15
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,140
 There's no way I can hold it in.

16
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,730
I told you that I found out everything.

17
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,150
That you are a kind person.

18
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,300
I know it all.

19
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,700
 What should I call this feeling

20
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,160
 that I cannot hold in?

21
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,700
You can't run away. Before you grant my wish.

22
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,160
I told you that I will release you if you grant my wish.

23
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,520
Do you not remember?

24
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,570
 I don't know.

25
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,380
 So I just...

26
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,990
- Tak Dong Kyeong. 
- You, seriously, I'm going to kill you–

27
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:41,110
 So I can just... only call you.

28
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,270
♫  Leave it as a memory  ♫

29
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:53,340
♫  You, I'll tell you now  ♫

30
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,150
♫  Love you, love you  ♫

31
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,200
♫  I only need you  ♫

32
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,520
♫  In a world that's about to explode  ♫

33
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:16,000
♫  I will protect you so you don't fall apart  ♫

34
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,400
You're really crazy.

35
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,520
Why would you break the bracelet?

36
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,290
Are you completely nuts?

37
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,030
Why didn't you appear?

38
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,570
And how could you put in the pillow like that? I'm so mad.

39
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,970
Why are you mad?

40
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,540
Because I didn't appear or putting in the pillow?

41
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,980
The pillow!

42
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,750
You're smiling?

43
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,560
How can you smile right now?

44
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,730
You're smiling, too?

45
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,880
You're smiling too right now.

46
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,390
You attention-seeker.

47
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,430
If you're going to hide, you should've done it properly. Not give me hints.

48
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,200
I tried to hold it in.

49
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,930
What and how were you going to hold in?

50
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,550
Preferably continuously.

51
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,740
You must've forgotten.

52
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,630
I don't really have time to call it "continuously".

53
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,610
I'll tell you.

54
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,270
I'll tell you everything.

55
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,950
 It's all because of me.

56
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,930
The reason you lost your parents.

57
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,520
All those times you sat at the beach.

58
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,620
All the misfortunes.

59
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,600
The reason you're sick. All of those.

60
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,600
You need to get re-educated for language.

61
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,230
The way you talk is like a crossword puzzle.

62
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,030
Give me some legit hints.

63
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,620
Is it horizontal or vertical?

64
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,150
Because I exist,

65
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,610
you're miserable.

66
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:01,090
What? Because you're winter, darkness, and the end?

67
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,130
Right.

68
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:07,490
Hey! I like winter.

69
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,880
I like night. I also like the end.

70
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,030
In other words,

71
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,390
spring, morning, and the start is all because of you, too.

72
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,670
Which means my misfortune and happiness is all you, too.

73
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,800
So you're giving me the disease and then the medicine.

74
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,670
When you give me disease, I'm mad. When you give me medicine, I'm thankful.

75
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,340
I don't want to get rained on.

76
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,920
But rain is needed.

77
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,260
You're something like that.

78
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,020
Go tell.

79
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,010
Who?

80
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,030
To that kid who drove you out of my life into my life.

81
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,700
It's not because of you.

82
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,680
Tell her that's what I said.

83
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,180
I got the right answer, right?

84
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,840
I got all the horizontal and vertical, right?

85
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,980
Don't do that.

86
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,830
That's what guys do to trick girls.

87
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,360
I know that.

88
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,480
Hey, I...

89
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,230
Who are you?

90
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,580
Where is Tak Dong Kyeong?

91
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,850
Excuse me? Who?

92
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,520
Excuse me.

93
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,730
Who are you to just barge in?

94
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,730
Excuse me?

95
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,120
Where...?

96
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,670
Hi, again.

97
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,250
Come here.

98
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,030
I'm on my way.

99
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,170
Yeah.

100
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,830
No, not a corn dog! A sausage!

101
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,590
Hey, they are totally different!

102
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:14,220
Yeah, yeah. Have it wrapped up. I'll be right there.

103
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,410
Where's your sister?

104
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,150
You scared me! Who are you?

105
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,150
Where is Tak Dong Kyeong?

106
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,470
Sorry?

107
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,690
Who's Tak Dong Kyeong?

108
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,830
Tak Dong Kyeong, your sister.

109
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,610
My sister?

110
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,580
I don't have a sister.

111
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,850
I'm an only child.

112
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,800
What the heck?

113
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,920
Yeah.

114
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,060
I don't know. Suddenly a stranger comes up and asks where my sister is.

115
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,500
So creepy!

116
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,160
Excuse me? Who?

117
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,570
Tak Dong Kyeong. Is she here?

118
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,770
Tak Dong Kyeong...

119
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,790
Is there anyone named Tak Dong Kyeong among the writers?

120
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,310
Who are you?

121
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,790
There. The girl who used to sit there, Tak Dong Kyeong.

122
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,350
I think you're at the wrong place.

123
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,430
Excuse me.

124
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,320
Who...?

125
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,500
That's my seat.

126
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,830
 No one.

127
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,430
 No one knows Tak Dong Kyeong.

128
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,520
 Tak Dong Kyeong...

129
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,050
 has been deleted in this world.

130
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,240
Where am I?

131
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,330
I was at the hospital.

132
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,320
Is this a dream?

133
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,240
It's not a dream.

134
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:35,540
I just stole you for a bit from this.

135
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,630
You were curious about what I planted here.

136
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,570
What is that?

137
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:50,190
A possibility. It grew up feeding on your misfortunes.

138
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,310
I wanted to show you. Since it's thanks to you.

139
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,830
- Thanks to me? 
 - This is the first time he felt pity for someone more than himself.

140
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,450
 But how did you become a grownup so fast?

141
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,580
 That's a secret.

142
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,300
 Please tell me.

143
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,650
 I want to be an adult, too.

144
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,850
 I'm still a kid like this.

145
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:54,850
 But you can't become an adult.

146
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,310
 Why not?

147
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,610
 Because you don't deserve to be an adult.

148
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,110
 No.

149
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,620
 Living as a puppet is so boring.

150
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,330
 I want to become an adult soon.

151
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,360
 You can become an adult.

152
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,630
 But then you need to be qualified.

153
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,800
 What can I do?

154
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,560
 It's very simple.

155
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,090
 You just have to try to be a good kid all the time.

156
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,790
 It's you.

157
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,030
You're the one who made him like that.

158
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,750
You're the one who drove him away.

159
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,250
You're the one who told him all my misfortunes are his fault.

160
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,300
- You're right. That was me. 
 - Why did you do that?

161
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,820
For you.

162
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,870
What do you mean?

163
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:48,200
You'll be miserable either way.

164
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,590
Whether you doom the world or survive after killing your loved one.

165
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,180
But I love him quite a bit. That's why I stepped in.

166
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,780
What... are you exactly?

167
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,240
Me?

168
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,050
I'm a very old order.

169
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,290
A very old loner.

170
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,980
I'm an old friend of yours.

171
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,170
I looked at the world more than he did.

172
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,940
And I always wished you to be happy in that world.

173
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,890
Then you can just make me happy. Him and I.

174
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,920
How is that meaningful?

175
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,970
If you can get your way easily, as you wish, for a very long time,

176
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,030
you would find out that those don't mean anything.

177
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,650
So what is it that you want from me?

178
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,580
- Why is that here? 
 - What do I want?

179
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,980
How about you?

180
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,400
The fate of all things in here depends on your love.

181
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,440
Isn't that scary?

182
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,170
Don't be miserable because of him anymore.

183
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,120
That's what I wanted to tell you.

184
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,800
No. I won't be miserable because of him.

185
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,300
Don't speak like that to him or me.

186
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,250
I was never miserable because of him.

187
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,620
I always like your answers.

188
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,010
Although they're a little too straightforward.

189
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:49,810
The threat to him should be enough by now.

190
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,550
Go. He's at the end of the road.

191
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,150
Knock gently before you open. You know, right?

192
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:59,120
Wow, you're...

193
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:03,430
you're really here.

194
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,240
Hi.

195
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,840
What are you?

196
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,930
- What are you exactly— 
 - I don't know either. I just opened my eyes and I was here.

197
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:19,190
She told me to walk straight this way.

198
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,220
Huh?

199
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,340
God's garden.

200
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,620
That was God's garden. Where you were.

201
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:58,840
Wow, is she really God?

202
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,790
That's good.

203
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:07,600
I told her my misfortunes are definitely not because of you.

204
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,160
Wait a sec. Did I say definitely or not?

205
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,240
I feel like I did.

206
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,390
- Then what did she say? 
 - She laughed.

207
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:20,330
Why did that little thing crack up?

208
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:23,370
Of course, she laughed. It's funny for me, too.

209
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,520
You're really fearless.

210
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,600
What do you mean fearless? To be honest, I was so scared.

211
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,180
I was like, "Is this heaven or hell?"

212
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,990
Still, I had to say what I had to.

213
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,790
Same for me.

214
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,620
I was scared.

215
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,890
Because no one remembered you.

216
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,300
 Sis!

217
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,620
I knew it! You escaped from the hospital and all you could do was go home?

218
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,030
What's going on?

219
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,030
What is this?

220
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,960
What is this place?

221
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,200
What is this?

222
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,700
We're screwed.

223
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,720
Wow! Wow!

224
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,750
What is this?

225
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:50,730
So... you're like a god or something?

226
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,850
I'm not god but doom.

227
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,510
That's the same thing.

228
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:59,090
That's not the same thing.

229
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,520
Well, it might be easier for him to understand that way.

230
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,680
You think?

231
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,470
You guys, what do you take me for?

232
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:09,320
That's enough. Do you think I'm an idiot?

233
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,310
You are teasing me right now, aren't you?

234
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,240
Who are you guys?

235
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,330
 Tak Seon Kyeong, stay alert.

236
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,870
 You can't get fooled by something like this.

237
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,010
Tak Seon Kyeong, stay alert.

238
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,240
You can't get fooled by something like this.

239
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,030
What is this?  Did I say it out loud?

240
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,780
 No.  This is a coincidence.  A coincidence.

241
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:34,080
No.  This is a coincidence.  A coincidence.

242
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,110
You siblings sure like coincidences.

243
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,590
Can you see what I am thinking now?

244
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,960
Don't look at what I am thinking.

245
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,180
To be precise, he says it's more like he hears rather than sees.

246
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,500
That's right.

247
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,970
Don't listen.

248
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,990
Did you two put your heads together?

249
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,790
Am I crazy?

250
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,200
Did I lose my mind because I am having such a hard time?

251
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,280
Noona, look at me.

252
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,720
Do I look like I am in my right mind?

253
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,800
Look at this.  How many is this?

254
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,320
- Two. 
 - This looks like two to you?

255
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,160
But it's three though.

256
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,830
- It's three? 
 - It's two, of course.

257
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,440
Do I still look like your sister to you?

258
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,710
He's going to cry.  You are worse than me.

259
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,380
Do something.  He can't handle it.

260
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,600
He has to accept it like you.  What am I supposed to do?

261
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,820
You know the thing that you always do.

262
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,660
What thing I always do?  I don't know what you are talking about.

263
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,540
Are you really a god?

264
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,720
Are you really doom or something like that?

265
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,950
Then... no way...

266
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,680
Are you here to take my sister away?

267
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,240
Why is the conversation heading that way now?

268
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,910
No.

269
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,250
I came to save her.

270
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,600
Really?  Are you really going to save her?

271
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,210
As expected, it pays to pray.

272
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,230
It's not because of your prayer.

273
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,150
Your prayer didn't come to me but went somewhere else.

274
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,350
Is there a different department for that, too?

275
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,090
Yeah.  So,

276
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:17,260
for now, forget about everything and get some sleep.

277
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,680
Excuse me?

278
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,810
I said, forget about everything and get some sleep.

279
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,820
I did do something.

280
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,600
Are you awake?

281
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,040
Noona!

282
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,590
Noona!

283
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,210
Are you okay?

284
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,810
I was so shocked when I received the call.

285
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:07,140
I thought I won't be able to see you again.

286
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,300
So, why did you make him worry?

287
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,020
You were here, Hyungnim?

288
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,760
Why did you come only now?

289
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,190
I was so scare—

290
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,390
Scared by myself.

291
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,460
Why do I feel as if I was with Hyungnim until just now?

292
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,600
- You must've had a dream. 
 - A dream?

293
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,840
You must like me a lot.

294
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,720
Yes.  I like you.

295
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,240
If you are done with your confession, let's go.

296
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,580
Go?  Where?

297
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,450
- Home. 
 - Ah, home.

298
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,890
Why would we go home?

299
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,160
Come to think of it, why did you change your clothes?

300
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,460
I am okay now.

301
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,270
What do you mean you are okay?  The doctor said you need an examination, too.

302
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:58,480
- Brother-in-law.
 - Please try to stop her, Hyungnim.

303
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,090
What is this?

304
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,240
Are the two of you on the same side?

305
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,680
Ah, I am not going!  I am never leaving!

306
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,540
I am not taking a single step from here.

307
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,620
Brother-in-Law.

308
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,350
Why are you like this, too?!

309
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,260
- If you keep doing this, I really— 
 - I am a doctor.

310
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,790
A doctor?

311
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,260
Hey, Tak Dong Kyeong!

312
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,950
Unni!

313
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:29,650
No, Unni, it's not like that.  There were reasons.  I really was going to tell you.

314
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,360
You... seriously.

315
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,570
I really tried to tell you many times.

316
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:40,010
What do you want to eat?

317
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:44,420
What do you want to do?  What do you want to have?  Where do you want to go?

318
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,360
I am going to do everything for you from now on.

319
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,100
So, tell me everything.

320
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,040
Just tell me.  What do you want me to do for you?

321
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:00,190
Hey, how can you do this to me?

322
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:03,030
How can you use my offer like this?

323
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:06,670
You said you would do everything for me, didn't you?  I really want to go home.

324
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,380
I really am okay.

325
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,670
- Hey, left turn, left turn. 
 - I know.

326
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,380
I am not okay.

327
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,900
Turn the car around.  I said turn the car around!

328
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,980
I can't drive because of the noise.

329
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,290
Keep this up and all four of us will die.

330
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:22,360
- Stop talking about dying! 
 - Stop talking about dying!

331
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,470
I guess people around you are mostly like that.

332
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:32,970
But... it's been getting on my nerves since earlier.

333
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,230
Who is he to talk informally to me?

334
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,280
- I never engaged you in a conversation. 
 - Hey!

335
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,150
Sorry, Unni.  He tends to habitually pick fights.

336
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:43,440
Excuse me!  Who are you?

337
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,460
Noonim, this isn't going to be solved by you getting emotional.

338
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,020
I know this because I've already been through it.  So, for now—

339
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,560
Be quiet!

340
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,870
No!

341
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,750
What did they say exactly, at the hospital?

342
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:16,020
It's glioblastoma multiforme and I have about three months, no—

343
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,130
Now, I must have about two months left.

344
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,240
Get up right now.  Let's go right now to the hospital and get surgery.

345
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,530
Ah, Noonim, actually he is a doctor.

346
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,500
Doctor or whatever.  Hey!

347
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,900
As her brother, you should stop her.  What are you doing?

348
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,710
It's not like there is a guarantee that I will live if I get surgery, right?

349
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:37,130
I could die during the surgery.

350
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,830
- Hey! 
 - Noona!

351
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,630
I will save you.

352
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,010
I will save her.

353
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,480
Why are you so surprised?

354
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,680
It's not like I am saying it for the first time.

355
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,710
Hey, who in the world is he?

356
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,610
Who is he to talk informally and act cool?

357
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,490
I can hear you.

358
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,540
He's my sister's boyfriend.  He says he's a doctor.

359
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,190
I hear you loudly.

360
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:09,700
A doctor?  Are you sure?  Did you confirm it?

361
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:14,330
I didn't confirm it, but he is her boyfriend for sure.

362
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,950
What's more, they are deeply in love.

363
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,010
There is no way.

364
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:22,530
If something like that happened, Tak Dong Kyeong would have immediately—

365
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:27,120
It's him.  The hospital—

366
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,040
The funeral hall... The person Tak Dong Kyeong wants to love—

367
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,720
You must've been going around talking a lot about me, I see.

368
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,020
What is this?  And what is the funeral hall about?

369
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,290
How come I don't know about it?

370
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,620
Is there anything you know?

371
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,910
But then again, what would you know?

372
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,890
You didn't even know to contact me when something like this occurred.

373
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:50,780
It's not that I didn't know but my sister told me not to tell you.

374
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,370
Since when did you listen to your sister so obediently?

375
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,860
But I still told you, even when my sister told me not to.

376
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,630
Wow!  You couldn't even look at me directly, but now you are even yelling at me.

377
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:03,260
- Hey, you've grown a lot! 
 - Enough.

378
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,370
Both of you, leave now.

379
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,920
Leave?

380
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,720
Which two?

381
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,950
These two?

382
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,930
These two.

383
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:15,970
I can't leave!  How can I leave you by yourself?

384
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:18,130
I am not alone.

385
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,040
I live with him.

386
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:26,940
He's going to sleep with me today, too.

387
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,780
What?!

388
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,510
I didn't know that she was that bold.

389
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:44,180
My sister changed a bit after getting sick.

390
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,370
But... it's okay.

391
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:51,660
That bro knew my sister was sick from the beginning and still dated her.

392
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,110
Hey, Tak Seon Kyeong.

393
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,610
- Yes? 
 - You changed a bit.

394
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,120
What?  Me?

395
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,840
No, that's not true.  I am very consistent.

396
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,530
I didn't finish what I was saying earlier but...

397
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,560
You've really grown a lot.

398
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,430
You grew up well.

399
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,610
- Excuse me? 
 - I am saying you had it tough.

400
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:19,420
Alone, while suffering inside.

401
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,640
From now on, let's share the tough times.

402
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,840
Each from their own place, let's do our best to see through the tough times.  Okay?

403
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:30,710
Don't get scared thinking that you are alone.

404
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:34,040
If you are Tak Dong Kyeong's little brother,  you are like my own little brother.

405
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,930
So, watch her and call me right away if anything happens, got that?!

406
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:43,470
If you don't call, I will break all your fingers.

407
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,990
No...

408
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,620
I really am innocent.

409
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,460
"Kka"? (informal speech ending)

410
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,550
Yo.  Kka-yo. (formal speech ending)

411
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,850
That little—

412
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,750
- She's the one who is acting like a little— 
 - Hey!

413
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,840
- Oh!  You startled me! 
 - You want to die?

414
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,460
Why would I die?

415
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,710
Hey, I told you to stop acting up.

416
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:05,030
What do you mean stop acting up?!  Just because I let you—

417
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,500
This little—

418
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,150
Ah, this is crazy. And yet, I still have to do housework. This is not right!

419
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,310
So, why are you making more mess?

420
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:31,960
You're saying it's because of me? It's all because you disappeared!

421
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,550
I didn't think you'd be acting so tough like that.

422
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:37,550
You should watch out. If you don't listen—

423
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:40,650
I never thought you'd use yourself as a hostage.

424
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:45,890
I didn't think it would work for me.

425
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:53,440
Why is there so much you don't know?

426
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,860
- I know. 
 - There's so much to teach.

427
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,500
Hand.

428
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,990
Let's live together.

429
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,540
Let's continue to live together.

430
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,720
And today,

431
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,680
we should sleep together again.

432
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,500
 The fate of all things in here depends on your love.

433
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,250
 Isn't that scary?

434
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,560
It's a good night.

435
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,350
Are you having fun?

436
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,120
It's not too bad.

437
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,580
Don't ever put your hand on her ever again.

438
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,800
I never put my hands on her.

439
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,100
I just put them on you.

440
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,660
What is it that you want exactly?

441
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,810
I was wrong.

442
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,240
You are loved by her.

443
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,490
I got scolded by her.

444
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:23,220
She said she was never miserable because of you.

445
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,750
I always hope I'm wrong.

446
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:30,510
I hope you guys are right.

447
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:38,180
But we're always wrong and you're right.

448
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:00,180
A vain hope is still hope.

449
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,690
A vain love is still love.

450
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,320
Did you try to call her?

451
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,400
She doesn't even answer the CEO's calls. Would she answer mine?

452
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,650
This is driving me crazy.

453
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:26,180
Should I try?

454
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,760
Look at your crazy confidence.

455
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,780
Then should we all visit her?

456
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,400
Of course, she'll gladly open the doors.

457
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:37,520
She'll need some time. And us, too.

458
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,180
Manager Tak must be having a hard time, right?

459
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,390
I wonder what she's up to.

460
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,710

461
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,790
Yes, Writer.

462
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:01,120
I heard.

463
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,350
You had a fight with Ji Jo King at the company dinner because of me?

464
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:09,490
It was definitely not because of you.

465
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,430
It was because of me.

466
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:15,010
I heard you quit. So I quit, too.

467
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:15,980
Sorry?

468
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,800
I told them I'm not re-signing the contract with Life Story.

469
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:25,710
Actually, I can only re-sign if the result is good.

470
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:29,360
What...?

471
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:34,030
I'm getting surgery next month. I'll try to hang on while getting chemo.

472
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,280
I got something I really want to write about.

473
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,820
I'll really work on it and sell it to be a drama. A high school romance story.

474
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,770
I made up the main characters as well.

475
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,590

476
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,770

477
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:58,940
It is him.

478
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:02,610
My male lead as I wish.

479
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:06,520
Is it funny that an older woman likes him?

480
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,210
Sorry? No.

481
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:10,950
It doesn't matter if it's funny.

482
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:15,770
But he's the only one that makes me laugh these days.

483
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,450
It's not funny. Not funny at all.

484
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:26,740
Why is that funny? It's so great.

485
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:32,000
When I'm done with this, I'll show it to you first.

486
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,740
Maybe around next year?

487
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,930
By then, we both should be done with our surgeries.

488
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:44,620
Romance sells well in the spring when the cherry blossoms start to bloom.

489
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:49,400
- Writer, I— 
 - You know what?

490
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,920
When there are more things to laugh about, you really want to hang on to life.

491
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:57,160
So you should love, too.

492
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,350
A love that will make you laugh.

493
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,180
- What is this? 
 - What?

494
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,790
Why are you here?

495
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,420
I came to pick you up.

496
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,050
You came to pick me up?

497
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,310
In case you run away.

498
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,530
Haha, very funny.

499
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,860
That's good.

500
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:51,160
Don't misunderstand. This is—

501
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,700
I know. Recharge.

502
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:58,130
It's not. I'm just holding because I want to.

503
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:03,180
You know what? In the spring, people come here a lot.

504
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,700
- Why? 
 - To see the cherry blossoms.

505
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,940
From here to way over there, it's all cherry blossoms.

506
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:16,050
If I had known, I would've gone on more picnics last spring.

507
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,820
I didn't know that would be the last time.

508
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,790
What is this? Did you do this?

509
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,220
Yes.

510
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:43,240
This really feels like spring.

511
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,570
It really is spring. Even though it's just for a bit.

512
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:51,380
We just traced back time for a bit. It's nothing special.

513
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:55,370
Sure, good for you.

514
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:58,870
♫  I think of one person  ♫

515
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:01,950
This is so pretty.

516
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,280
I only have good memories of spring.

517
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,550
When there were cherry blossoms like this,

518
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:12,530
Mom, Dad, and Seon Kyeong, we all rode a Ferris wheel and took a picture.

519
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:15,400
I'm as happy as that day right now.

520
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,290
♫  ...that one person  ♫

521
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:23,000
♫  When I see you,  ♫

522
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,840
Hey.

523
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,800
I like you.

524
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:35,560
♫  Shines clearly with countless stars  ♫

525
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:39,190
♫  Dream-like love, don't you know it yet?  ♫

526
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:42,650
I said I like you.

527
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:49,540
Wow, that felt good. I'll get going.

528
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:53,890
I'm not coming home. I'm sleeping over at Unnie's.

529
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,010
Unni!

530
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,910
What is that? What is that in your mouth?

531
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:25,330
I-I didn't light it. I just put it in my mouth.

532
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:27,340
I told you to not smoke!

533
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,950
I told you you'll die young, so you should quit!

534
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:32,710
Well, I didn't know you'd be coming over.

535
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,220
Seriously.

536
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,310
What's wrong? Are you sick?

537
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,930
I just wanted to see you.

538
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:47,750
I missed you so much to death.

539
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,290
Don't say death.

540
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,910
Unni, you said you'll do anything I want, right?

541
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:58,740
Yeah. What is it? Just tell me.

542
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,960
Treat me like you usually do.

543
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,180
Just forget that I'm sick and like always,

544
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:09,580
just say things, eat things together, and nag at me sometimes.

545
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,890
Please do that.

546
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:16,760
That's what I want the most from you.

547
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,900
I'm hungry. Should we order some jokbal?

548
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,300
Jokbal sounds great.

549
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,640
Medium or large?

550
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,390
Of course large!

551
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:32,420
- Add makguksu. 
 - All right.

552
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:35,840
It's going to be so good.

553
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:44,790
It's been a while since we came grocery shopping together.

554
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:48,920
You buy what you're eating.

555
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,560
So who's that girl?

556
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:58,440
That girl last time.

557
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,480
At your company. You guys seemed close.

558
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:17,170
 - Welcome. 
 - Hello.

559
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:24,980
What is it?

560
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:29,490
- There was a car behind you. 
 - A car?

561
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:31,920
What car? There isn't any.

562
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,810
There was one. A strolling car.

563
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:38,990
Did I just almost get hit by a stroller?

564
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:42,310
Well, we both almost got hit.

565
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,790
I tried to sneak a peek.

566
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:48,470
But because of customers, I didn't get to see the face.

567
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,130
- You won't introduce her to me? 
 - It's not like that.

568
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:55,790
Then, what is it?

569
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:57,980
- It's just. 
 - Just what?

570
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,470
Just a writer.

571
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:03,910
Stop lying! I saw your face!

572
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:06,540
You're always like this.

573
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,950
You always act, then realize later.

574
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:11,510
Your head must be slower than your heart.

575
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:13,910
Being too smart isn't always great.

576
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:17,960
Hello? What is—

577
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,710
Hello?

578
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:22,430
Yes.

579
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,930
Where are you?

580
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:26,580
Okay.

581
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:29,480
I think I have to go.

582
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,470
- Where? 
 - The kid called me.

583
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:33,680
I don't think he's in his right mind. He's bawling.

584
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,400
- The kid? 
 - Seon Kyeong.

585
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,770
I'll get going. See you at home.

586
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:39,430

592
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,120
Hey, why aren't you answering your phone?

593
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,990
How are you here?

594
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:22,100
- You called me? 
 - I did?

595
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,390
I called you?

596
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:29,380
Oh, I called you.

597
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,540
You're totally out.

598
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:34,200
What is it? What's going on?

599
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:37,180
- Boss. 
 - Yes.

600
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:40,610
Boss!

601
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:44,560
What's wrong?

602
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,690
Did you get dumped by a girl?

603
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:50,690
You shouldn't do anything you'll regret.

604
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,090
Boss, you know...

605
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:57,100
"Later" means nothing.

606
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:00,050
You have to do it now. You'll regret it if you don't do it now.

607
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:04,880
So don't live saying "later, later" but say "now, now."

608
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,250
You got it?

609
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:10,740
You'll really regret it. All your life.

610
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,740
You'll keep regretting it.

611
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:15,630
Really, really.

612
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:19,410
But then why are you speaking informally?

613
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,970
I'm so drunk.

614
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,660
Unni, phone.

615
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:50,210
You're getting a call.

616
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:02,620
This is nice.

617
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,390
Should I steal it?

618
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,580
Who is it?

619
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:20,010
Team leader.

620
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,850
Your hair looks nice.

621
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:27,030
So...

622
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:33,540
you two signed a separate contract?

623
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:37,230
- So what happened is— 
 - It's a waste.

624
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:40,280
I could see if I guided her a little, she would do so much better.

625
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,740
Right. So it's goodwill?

626
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,810
Of course, it's for profit.

627
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:46,020
So you only 'work' together?

628
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,400
Hey, of course. How can you say that?

629
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,730
Do you do things other than work with a writer?

630
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:54,530
I do. I eat, I drink coffee, and take a walk once in a while together.

631
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:57,120
I'm not saying you guys should do that.

632
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,630
I'll keep that in mind when I want to do other things.

633
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:02,900
You saw, right? This person never lets one go.

634
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:06,110
- This person? 
 - I can say it since I quit.

635
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:10,920
Anyway, I'm done checking, so I'll leave you two.

636
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,500
You're leaving? Already?

637
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,530
I also have someone waiting for me at home.

638
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:18,540
Bye.

639
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:20,690
I signed you up for leave for now.

640
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:23,910
Just fire me so I can get unemployment benefits.

641
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:27,280
You tell him. Stop ignoring CEO's calls.

642
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,110
When could I ignore his calls if not now? I'm really off.

643
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:32,860
Bye.

644
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,520
Bye.

645
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,700
She looks better than I thought, yet.

646
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:46,160
I'm not sure if she's okay or if she's pretending.

647
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:50,280
So what brings you here, Team leader?

648
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,390
- I'm a team leader to you, too? 
 - You came because you were worried about me, right?

649
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:55,800
I was worried about the series.

650
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,640
I'm sorry you had to witness that that day.

651
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,310
I came because I was worried about the series. Don't change the subject.

652
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:07,250
Did you get some progress?

653
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:11,520
It seems like I get caught when I'm in a  the low spot.

654
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,960
Why is it always like this?

655
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,460
It's because I'm nice.

656
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:20,220
It's because my fantastic personality can't ignore a crying lady.

657
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,700
You're recognizing a nice person very well.

658
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:27,060
You recognize and tend to sit right in front of him every time.

659
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:29,560
Wow, that's so funny.

660
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,570
I hear that a lot.

661
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:35,250
I didn't really mean funny. Don't you get it?

662
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:38,320
Well, I hear that a lot, too.

663
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,580
I didn't come to say these lame things.

664
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,570
I came to tell you something.

665
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:51,220
I didn't think it could wait any longer. If I did—

666
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,910
What is it?

667
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:58,460
I don't know where I should start.

668
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:02,390
I didn't mean it from the beginning.

669
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,630
Hold on.

670
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:09,220
Did Dong Kyeong leave something behind?

671
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,070
Sorry for not appearing.

672
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:55,070
That was sudden.

673
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,620
But you're really nuts, too.

674
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:02,380
How can you say you'll jump off?

675
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:08,480
Hey, you're saying that you heard everything and still didn't come?

676
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:13,140
Look where you're going.

677
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:30,600
♫  You who doesn't wither  ♫

678
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:36,630
♫  You who shines brighter in the dark  ♫

679
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:38,940
What is this?

680
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,630
You said you were happy that day.

681
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:46,190
♫  On a tiring day  ♫

682
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:51,680
♫  You're the love that went through eternity  ♫

683
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,700
♫  I won't regret it  ♫

684
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:00,420
♫  Don't be anxious  ♫

685
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:05,350
♫  Even if it's a road with a definite end  ♫

686
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:09,520
You're so useful in so many ways.

687
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:14,440
♫  You're my one and only  ♫

688
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,050
♫  The one who held my hand when I was standing at the end of a cliff  ♫

689
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:18,760
Why are you staring at me?

690
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,000
Since you're right there.

691
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,710
Then should I move next to you?

692
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:27,140
That won't do. The balance will be off.

693
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:31,510
♫  It's so precious  ♫

694
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:33,190
♫  Please remember them  ♫

695
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:35,560
This is so pretty.

696
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,710
Like it'll disappear.

697
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,840
Things that disappear tend to be beautiful.

698
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:59,390
When I disappeared, you said no one remembered me. Right?

699
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:00,890
Right.

700
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:10,040
When I die, I hope that's how it is.

701
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:17,230
I hope the people left behind all forget me.

702
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:20,410
So they won't be too sad because of me.

703
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:29,320
I hope I disappear as if I evaporated.

704
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:40,180
Is there any chance

705
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:48,300
I could wish that—

706
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,590
♫  All of my love  ♫

707
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:56,720
♫  You're my one and only  ♫

708
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:03,120
♫  The one who held my hand when I was standing at the end of a cliff  ♫

709
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,080
♫  All of my love  ♫

710
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:09,340
♫  All the times that were like miracles  ♫

711
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:13,980
♫  It's so precious  ♫

712
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:20,900
♫  Please remember them, even if they all disappear  ♫

713
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:27,820
You always do that so suddenly.

714
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:29,710
What do you mean?

715
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:33,030
- That... 
 - What? Kiss?

716
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:37,880
Well, you didn't have to point that out.

717
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,880
Don't use your wish for others.

718
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,260
I'll do what I can.

719
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:58,060
So use your wish for yourself, so you won't regret it.

720
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:04,880
I did use the wish for myself.

721
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,460
But you didn't grant it.

722
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:15,860
 I want you to love me.

723
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:22,100
 Can I make that my wish?

724
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,780
 No.

725
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:28,490
You're the one who said no.

726
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:37,790
If it's that, you don't have to use your wish.

727
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:43,340
What do you mean—

728
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,120
I'm sor—

729
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,400
Are you okay?

730
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,530
Are you all right?

731
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:54,440
Are you okay?

732
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,900
I'm sorry. Sorry.

733
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,690
Dong Kyeong, Seon Kyeong.

734
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:10,590
Mom!

735
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:16,480
Let's eat cotton candy and get on the Ferris wheel.

736
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:25,560
I thought you'd want to see that.

737
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:42,490
I can only show you for a bit.

738
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:50,320
Did I make a mistake?

739
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,560
No.

740
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:00,830
It's because I'm happy.

741
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:08,200
I'm happy. I was happy just now.

742
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,480
Very, very much.

743
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,420
Tak Dong Kyeong.

744
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:20,380
Yeah?

745
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,820
Like me.

746
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,910
You can like me.

747
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:33,840
Now I don't care about anything other than you.

748
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,020
You don't have to use your wish.

749
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:39,080
That's my answer. So—

750
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,090
Tak Dong Kyeong!

751
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,100
Mom?

752
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:10,310
Auntie!

753
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,870
So choose.

754
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:24,570
World or you.

755
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:40,230

756
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:47,220
♫  You, don't forget  ♫

757
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:54,490
♫  Just once is enough, leave it as a memory  ♫

758
00:57:54,490 --> 00:58:01,100
♫  You, I'll tell you now  ♫

759
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,680
♫  Love you, love you  ♫

760
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:08,280

761
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:11,450
 Living is so fun for me.

762
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:12,430
 Sa Ram

763
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:14,610
 You got time? Let's hang out together.

764
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:17,080
 I'll take everything from here to here.

765
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,520
 I'm taking it.

766
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,940
 Smile.

767
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:24,390
 - Your wish. 
 - That you live with a smile in the world you love.

768
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:26,530
 The person you like?

769
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:29,560
 Even if you have one, go out with me, since I still like you.

770
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,720
 I fell in love with you.

771
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:36,830
 So let's break up.

772
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:42,050
♫  You, I'll tell you now  ♫
