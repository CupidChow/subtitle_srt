1
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,690

2
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,570

3
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,930

4
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,690

5
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,980

6
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:50,200

7
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:59,500

8
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,990
 This drama is fiction.  All characters, places, institutions, religions, and events that appear are not real.

9
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,880

10
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:29,570
Dang! W-W-Who are you?

11
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,060
A smoker.

12
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,660
I'm asking, what are you doing there?

13
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,820
What? Oh, is this a non-smoking area?

14
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,870
You punk, are you joking?

15
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,880
Does this seem like a joke?

16
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,080
When a smoker doesn't have a light?

17
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,190
Piss off when I'm being nice.

18
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,820
When were you nice? You were always bad.

19
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,870
Dang it, piss off! D-Do you know w-who I am?

20
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,990
I don't care who you are.

21
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,050
This bastard!

22
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,390
Dang!

23
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,620
You bastard.

24
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,520
No!

25
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,940
Light.

26
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,670
Should I light it?

27
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,670
Don't want it?

28
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,750
W-Who are you, to do this to me?

29
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,630
Me? I'm a victim of the violation of his rights by you.

30
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,280
A-Are you like the o-owner of this building?

31
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,620
Not really. If I was, I wouldn't even have given you the time to answer.

32
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,790
You bastard. Hey!

33
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,120
What are you doing? Don't touch—

34
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,280
First, a cat, then arson.

35
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,610
Then a kid, elders, ladies.

36
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,790
That's usually how it goes for jerks like you.

37
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,470
What's it got to do with you? Just go on your way.

38
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,260
What if I killed some mere animals? So what?

39
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,840
I tell her to pull out things like you all the time, yet she won't budge.

40
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,510
No matter how much I think about it, that's the better way.

41
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,700
Those animals were...

42
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,520
They were so noisy that I...

43
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,960
I know. So noisy.

44
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,040
What are you doing? Don't!

45
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,410
You mere thing.

46
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,540
Yeah, I just arrived at the hospital.

47
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,670
See you later.

48
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,090
Hello.

49
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,690
Oh, Editor, welcome.

50
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,730
You're here?

51
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,690
You'll be admitted tomorrow, we'll do a biopsy then start with the treatment.

52
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,050
I will tell you the accurate diagnosis after the biopsy results come out.

53
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,200
But usually, we'll do chemo and radiation therapy.

54
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,450
It still doesn't feel real.

55
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,380
You just relax.

56
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,220
If this goes well, you can just be an outpatient.

57
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:29,300
You are so young and without many symptoms, so we can be hopeful.

58
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,190
Yes, Writer. No.

59
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,760
I should call you Doctor from now on. Doctor Jeong Seung Joon.

60
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:41,300
Yes, I will be talking to you as a doctor from now on, so brace yourself as a patient.

61
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,100
You're so scary as a doctor.

62
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,370
Lies. If you were scared, you would've come a lot earlier.

63
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,800
Do you know how concerned I was?

64
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,000
I had my reasons.

65
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,840
What reasons?

66
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,900
I definitely had reasons...

67
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,190
But I can't really remember.

68
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,240
It's possible you won't remember things. It's one of the symptoms.

69
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,840
Oh, symptoms... Right, do you like apples?

70
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,880
I felt bad coming empty-handed.

71
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,960
Share it with your bride-to-be.

72
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,020
There was an old lady selling apples at the front and a bicycle spilled the basket—

73
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,740
Those aren't the spilled apples. Those are the clean ones.

74
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,560
The spilled ones are these.

75
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,010
These are for me.

76
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,210
You're so considerate.

77
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:46,010
- Sorry? 
 - I want to tell you to live selfishly.

78
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,620
But that doesn't just happen.

79
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,330
Just live as you want.

80
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:58,650
If you want to help someone, help him. If you want to be at a loss, do that too.

81
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,580
So I don't regret it?

82
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,660
No.

83
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,790
I like that you're always nice.

84
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:13,080
At the end,

85
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,100
being nice always wins.

86
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,340
Nice Tak Dong Kyeong, let's win this.

87
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,210
Okay.

88
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:38,550
The humans that you love, keep becoming more tiresome.

89
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:43,510
Look at you. Do you really think it's worth that?

90
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,270
They don't know. They don't know anything.

91
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:54,210
- You don't know either. 
 - I know. I heard so many times, so I know.

92
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,290
That the garden isn't yours.

93
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,750
And that I'm just a butterfly in that garden.

94
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,120
- Right. 
 - A butterfly is different from a gardener.

95
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,990
He doesn't sit on any flower.

96
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,090
I'm saying that you and I are different.

97
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,200
There isn't a single flower that I like.

98
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,560
Not a single one?

99
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,390
Not a single one.

100
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,380
- Aren't they pitiful? 
 - Not at all.

101
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,800
- And not lovely? 
 - Not even one.

102
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,730
Right.

103
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,810
I'm off.

104
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,610
I'm sorry.

105
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,430
After all this?

106
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,410
I'm sorry.

107
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,790
I'm sorr—

108
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,520
  What kind of face—

109
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,130
I know that I'm handsome, but I'm busy.

110
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,920
Here. I couldn't come empty-handed.

111
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,190
Those are clean.

112
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,460
What do you mean these are clean?

113
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,180
It's fine if they're not clean since they're from you.

114
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,800
Apples. How did you know I love apples?

115
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,140
I will enjoy them.

116
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,080
So are you going to be admitted to the hospital?

117
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,560
Yes.

118
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,190
But thinking about actually being in here, getting tested and treated, is a little scary.

119
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,980
Look at me. My surgery went well.

120
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,490
You will be fine, too.

121
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,920
It's good that things turned out well for you.

122
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,740
You were so twinkly. Why are you so shady now?

123
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,630
Who is it? Who did that?

124
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,390
Twinkly? I was?

125
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:50,090
You told me living is fun.

126
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:54,400
Aren't you getting admitted and treated so you can live that fun life more?

127
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,590
Then, why are you so down? Making me worried.

128
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,380
So I said it was fun.

129
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,080
To be honest, I can't really remember well.

130
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:15,290
I keep forgetting. I was told it's because of this.

131
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:21,890
I'm a little scared that I might be losing the happy moments like this.

132
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:26,790
But apparently, I'm really healthy and well, considering my condition.

133
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:31,730
I can be an outpatient, too. I'm trying to be positive.

134
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,680
Of course. I'll be cheering you on.

135
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,360
Thank you for coming over, Editor.

136
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:52,030
I thought I wouldn't be able to see you for a while once I start chemo.

137
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,120
I'll come. I'll come often.

138
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,940
I'll come with lots of yummy and pretty things.

139
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:04,800
Even if you forget everything, I'll come so you'll make more happy memories.

140
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,630
Oh, do you like tulips?

141
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,540
Tulips?

142
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:19,150
Someone brought this earlier but I don't have a vase.

143
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,220
It's so pretty, I don't want it to be wasted.

144
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:29,130
Take that. Today's happy memory.

145
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,770

146
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:11,080
I must really be out of my mind.

147
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,260
What's today's date?

148
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,630

149
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:23,190
Oh my gosh! How old is this milk?

150
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:28,030
Is this milk that precious? Is that why you're keeping it?

151
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,130
- Noona, you still contact this bastard? 
 - Who?

152
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,620
Your ex-boyfriend.

153
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,700
Hey!

154
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,940
Hey, did you have a boyfriend?

155
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,730
Not a boyfriend but an ex-boyfriend. He—

156
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:53,210
Not a boyfriend. Just a lunatic.

157
00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:00,510
 I heard. It made me think a lot.

158
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,890
 I wonder if it's because I broke your heart.

159
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:08,260
 I got divorced because of you and had to go to hair loss therapy.

160
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,250
 But I'm trying to forgive you now.

161
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:18,130
Is this jerk really crazy? How dare he text me?

162
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,930
 Joon Woo, I love you.

163
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:31,780
Right. I should hold back and forgive.

164
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,970
I forgive everything. I'm forgetting all the bad memories.

165
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,390
Forgive? Forgive, my butt.

166
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,370
Why didn't you block him?

167
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,070
So did you have a boyfriend?

168
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:46,490
I said he's not a boyfriend but a crazy scumbag!

169
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,490

170
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:55,030
Good job. Let me know if he contacts you again. I'll take care of him right away.

171
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:58,270
Shut up. I might take care of you first.

172
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:01,530
Why don't you want me to care for you?

173
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,240
By the way, didn't you have another guy other than that bastard?

174
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,970
What the heck?

175
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:12,000
Why do I keep getting the feeling that you had another guy?

176
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,390
Wow, Tak Dong Kyeong, you're really hot.

177
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,620
Two at once?

178
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,910
No way.

179
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:22,090
That's right, Noona isn't at that level.

180
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,550
Hey, you, seriously! Come here.

181
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:29,660
You always need a beating.

182
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,080
I mean, am I wrong?

183
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,500
Come here. Hey. Hey!

184
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:48,520
Why? Does it feel weird?

185
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,800
It's just...

186
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,930
Thinking the house will be empty for a while.

187
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,670
I'll stop by once in a while.

188
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:03,020
And bring whatever you need right away.

189
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,600
What about Uncle?

190
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,020
Your uncle? He'll come back after he takes care of stuff in Canada.

191
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:16,630
Don't worry.

192
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,340
All because of me...

193
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:25,700
Stop thinking that.

194
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:45,020

195
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,600
Leave them. Why are you organizing?

196
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,780
Tak, you look good in a hospital gown.

197
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,760
Are you a warm tone or cool tone?

198
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:24,170
Aunt went down to get some supplies. She'll be back soon.

199
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,690
You shouldn't have come.

200
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:30,290
Look at you. Who else should come then?

201
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,990
Have you forgotten that I'm a freelancer?

202
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,890
You struggle to move around in the morning.

203
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,350
Did you get some sleep? How's the series?

204
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,230
I did it.

205
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:44,680
Lying again. I check every day and haven't seen any updates.

206
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,690
What? Not working out?

207
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,720
I'm writing.

208
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,400
Well, I keep writing then deleting.

209
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,350
I can't make up my mind.

210
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,860
Come to your senses, Writer.

211
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,490
Making a living is done with your writing, not your heart.

212
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,430
- What is a writer? 
 - A technician.

213
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:06,720
Right, so go get a cup of strong coffee,

214
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,400
come back to your senses, then write again.

215
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,120
No coffee for you. Get some juice.

216
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,460
- Cold-pressed 100% juice. 
 - Yes, ma'am.

217
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,730
That's when they started saying this hospital site is weird.

218
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,450
Then maybe this was originally a funeral home.

219
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:29,250
I heard that some building was demolished to build this building.

220
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,560
And they built a new funeral home over there.

221
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,260
Wow.

222
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:39,220
You're right. So there must be more than one ghost.

223
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,790
More than one?

224
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,660
Sometimes he's super tall, then super short.

225
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,090
Sometimes he's a grandpa, then a youngster.

226
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:50,790
- The nurse saw a lady. 
 - Creepy.

227
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:55,360
So you ladies shouldn't wander around at night,  keep inside.

228
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,660
I heard he's around in broad daylight. What good is it to be careful at night?

229
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,720
Still, it's scarier at night since it's dark.

230
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,400
Right, that makes sense.

231
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,990
So you came here often, too.

232
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,290
Did you ever see something creepy?

233
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,720
Something creepy?

234
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,430
I did see a super handsome doctor once.

235
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,760
A handsome doctor?

236
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,390
That must be the ghost.

237
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,320
Why?

238
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,130
I've been in this hospital for over a year.

239
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:31,320
And I've never seen a handsome doctor.

240
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,220
If I did, would be no way I wouldn't remember.

241
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:39,000
There aren't many chances to see handsome men.

242
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,790
Let's see, in my life, I've seen...

243
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:49,690
one, two, three, four, five.

244
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,520
Five men.

245
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,120
Among those, the handsome men I've seen in this hospital is...

246
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,590
zero.

247
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:03,500
I definitely saw one. He was wearing a doctor's gown.

248
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,130
Gosh, I can't listen anymore. This is scary.

249
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,930
Why?

250
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,960
The ghosts here all act like doctors.

251
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,540
Over there!

252
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,470
- No way. 
 - Oh my gosh.

253
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,440
He really scared me.

254
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,850
He's a person.

255
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,340
How do you know?

256
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,630
I'm sure.

257
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,720
It's cold. Go in.

258
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,970
I'm just going to see you off.

259
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,640
What if a ghost comes up?

260
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,950
I think I should walk you up to your room—

261
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:50,820
Seriously, what ghost? What I saw was a person for sure.

262
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,530
- Are you sure? 
 - Yeah.

263
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:57,240
He knew he was handsome. Then that's 100%.

264
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,100
The handsome guy who knows he's handsome.

265
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,340
That's so nice and dangerous.

266
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:06,340
Hurry back and write your series, Writer.

267
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,800
- Don't come here until you're done. 
 - Hey.

268
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,400
What do you mean 'hey'? Just write.

269
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,970
Let's go, Na Ji Na.

270
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,540
It's not like I can't. I'm just not doing it.

271
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,410
Fine. I'll finish it up and be back tomorrow.

272
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:21,890
I like that energy. Drive safe.

273
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,510
Okay.

274
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,930
Bye.

275
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,990
How can I help you?

276
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:20,320
I was curious about what a father that beat his child to death looked like.

277
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,300
So this is what you look like.

278
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,160
What are you?

279
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,320
Did the kid's mother send you?

280
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:41,230
You must've heard something weird.

281
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,820
But she's not sane.

282
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,450
I hear something weird from there.

283
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,610
"This feels good. I got rid of a burden."

284
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:52,290
"Now I'm making a new start and hope I won't get caught."

285
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,440
"I told him he shouldn't whine."

286
00:24:58,810 --> 00:24:59,780
You killed him.

287
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,400
What bullshit is that?

288
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,270
Hey, did that bitch say she'll pay you if you do this?

289
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:10,280
I'm not giving a single dime from the insurance or as alimony.

290
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,590
So how about you give me some condolence money?

291
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:16,070
Where do you think you are to spew this bullshit?

292
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,470
Right leg fracture.

293
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,910
Two broken ribs.

294
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:30,030
You stepped on and broke that little body.

295
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,670
It was fun for you, right? Just like you wished.

296
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:50,800
Why can't I reach it?

297
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:03,660
You must've not known this, but doom is not within your jurisdiction, but mine.

298
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:12,800
Since you exercised my rights at your will, I intend to do the same.

299
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,480
What do you think?

300
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,260
This is annoying.

301
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,810

302
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:14,940

303
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,500

304
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,500
He just left it on?

305
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,480

306
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,530

307
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,500

308
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,490

309
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,440

310
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,530

311
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:39,010

312
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,050
Writer Lee Hyeon?

313
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,230
What is this?

314
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,860
What is this? Why are you here?

315
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,880
You're stuck.

316
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,880
Why do you care?

317
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,790
You said we wouldn't bump into each other because of work.

318
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,460
I know.

319
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,230
I keep going against what I said.

320
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,730
So why do you keep bothering me?

321
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,360
Are you blaming me?

322
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,740
Yes.

323
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,620
I quit work.

324
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,210
Why? Because of me? Because I threw a fit?

325
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,490
You did play a role.

326
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,990
So you want me to take responsibility?

327
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,590
What's that got to do with the series?

328
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:40,820
No, I felt responsible.

329
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,590
It seems like you're stuck at your series because of me.

330
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:46,340
Stop saying things I can't understand and leave.

331
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,170
The male lead is me.

332
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,980
You knew I'd read it.

333
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,280
- That— 
 - I—

334
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,130
Go ahead.

335
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,530
That's not you, the male lead.

336
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,990
Your turn.

337
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,730
I'm going to ask you something important.

338
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,170
Do you like me?

339
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,180
I wish you'd answer me clearly.

340
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:39,330
- Why? 
 - So I can act clearly.

341
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,720
If I should steal...

342
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,780
- or forget? 
 - No.

343
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,490
Or love by myself.

344
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,660
You probably need some time to think.

345
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,580
Think about it and let me know.

346
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,960
Where are you going?

347
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,290
- Home. 
 - Just like that?

348
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:11,400
In the next episode, write that she broke up with that guy and met him again after nine years.

349
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,710
What kind of a guy is he?

350
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,640

351
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,970
I don't drink this.

352
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:50,050
- You can't drink coffee? 
 - No.

353
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,380
Is it because it's from a vending machine?

354
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,750
Your taste buds have very high standards.

355
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,530
I don't normally eat.

356
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:03,380
- You don't or you can't? 
 - I don't.

357
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:07,320
Then, do you eat food from memorial rite services?

358
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:10,940
- What? 
 - I'm sorry, but could I pinch you just once?

359
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:14,700
Wow, I can touch you. So, you must not be a ghost.

360
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,120
Then, how did you do that earlier?

361
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,770
- That? 
 - Earlier, you made the sirens on the car wail and all the lights flash.

362
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,520
Are you skilled at that kind of thing?

363
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,170
- That kind of thing? 
 - With devices?

364
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,580
Electricity?

365
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,770
  I thought about this before, too,

366
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:43,550
  but how can a ghost be so handsome?

367
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,150
You.

368
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,550
You've seen me before?

369
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,110
What?

370
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:52,830
Last time at the hospital, I bumped into you when you had a doctor's uniform on.

371
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,700
You don't remember?

372
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,300
You remember my face?

373
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:02,430
Of course, I do. Your face is not easy to forget.

374
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:07,070
Oh, that's why the ladies last time were saying they didn't see the handsome guy.

375
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,750
For my job, I read a lot of web novels.

376
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:15,060
I'm used to these unusual occurrences. Don't worry.

377
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:17,820
Yeah, well.

378
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,210
I guess I don't have to worry.

379
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:25,350
  But how come I started seeing a ghost all of a sudden?

380
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:29,950
  Is having hallucinations a symptom of a brain tumor?

381
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:32,030
  Is he a ghost or am I seeing things?

382
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,660
- That's better. 
 - What?

383
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,530
Think of me as a hallucination.

384
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,160
All right. What?

385
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:43,200
What? Did you just read my mind?

386
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,160
Not much of reading, but it's more like listening.

387
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,050
Why would you listen to my thoughts like that?

388
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:51,910
Is that important right now? You're seeing something strange right now.

389
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:55,510
Right? Why am I seeing this?

390
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,590
Do you have some sort of business with me?

391
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,830
Or do I need to relieve your resentment?

392
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:04,040
It seemed like you were following someone earlier. Would you like my help?

393
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:08,160
Who are you pitying right now? We're on the same boat.

394
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,960
- What? 
 - You're going to die soon.

395
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,070
You're going to die.

396
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:22,940
No matter what you do, you're fated to die.

397
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,550
- I'm going to die? 
 - Yeah.

398
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,830
I need to get going. I was in the middle of something.

399
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:42,400
Even if you tell others about me,

400
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,560
people will think you're just seeing things because you're sick.

401
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,000
Just keep your mouth shut.

402
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,600
What! Wait a minute. Hey!

403
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,210
How can a man be that annoying?

404
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:59,360
Why's he talking down to me?!

405
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,220
Geez.

406
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,030
Why am I so sleepy?

407
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:54,110
Is anyone there?

408
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:56,800
There's a person here!

409
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,950
Please save me!

410
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,300
Please save me!

411
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:11,810
How is it?

412
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:14,150
How does it feel being trapped, after trapping others for so long?

413
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,110
It was my fault.

414
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,920
It was my fault!

415
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,090
Please forgive me. Please forgive me.

416
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:25,690
I told you countless times, and you never listened to me.

417
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,270
No, no! It was my fault! It was my fault!

418
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:32,560
No! No! It was my fault! No!

419
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,180
Did you hear the fuss at the hospital yesterday?

420
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,890
Yesterday, someone came into the ER after consuming rat poison.

421
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,790
His eyes rolled backward.

422
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:43,350
He kept saying, "It was my fault. It was my fault!"

423
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:46,960
Some crazy person crawled into the morgue yesterday.

424
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,860
In the morning, he totally went insane and said a bunch of nonsense,

425
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,730
saying he killed his child. It was chaos.

426
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,930
So that's why the police came.

427
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:58,650
- Yeah. 
 - I see.

428
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,150
Aunt,

429
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,100
should we change hospitals?

430
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,210
No, no. The writer is here. But still.

431
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,290
It's really weird here, Aunt.

432
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,140
It's like this wherever a lot of people are.

433
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,110
It's the same if you go to a big hospital.

434
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:14,180
At least, it's better at a hospital where there is a doctor you are familiar with.

435
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,450
There's really a ghost here.

436
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:22,150
- Ta-da! Noona! 
 - Hey.

437
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,630
Aren't you supposed to be working right now?

438
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,110
Why are you here at this hour?

439
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:29,180
Well, I just wanted to see your face before I went off to work.

440
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:32,450
And see our pretty aunt, too.

441
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:34,800
Oh, you and your words.

442
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,020
I got you walnut cookies.

443
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,520
I thought they would get cold, so I ran over here.

444
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,640
They're still warm.

445
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,560
Hello!

446
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,960
Please take good care of my sister.

447
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,240
- Thank you! 
 - Please have some.

448
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,080
Thank you, we'll enjoy it.

449
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,350
Young man, you're so handsome.

450
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,650
Oh, no, I'm not.

451
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:56,000
You rank as the #1 most handsome man in this hospital!

452
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,640
That's so right!

453
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,710
Come here often!

454
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:02,130
All right, thank you.

455
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:04,540
I'll be going. I'll come back after work.

456
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,710
Gosh, what chaos!

457
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:10,250
- Noona. 
 - Go and work, I said!

458
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,530
Oh, my.

459
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:15,740
- He ranks second. 
 - Second.

460
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:19,400
Do you know how busy I am?

461
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,210
Yes.

462
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:24,050
Why'd such a busy person show up here?

463
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:26,860
You didn't come here to eat walnut cookies, I assume?

464
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,910
I had something scheduled nearby, so I'm just passing by.

465
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:32,990
Why would you pass by here? How'd you know?

466
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,580
I asked my mom.

467
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,840
She probably asked CEO Park.

468
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,510
CEO Park probably asked Manager Jo.

469
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,830
So, why are you here?

470
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,320
Are you asking because you really don't know?

471
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,250
Of course, I came here to make your hospital stay more comfortable.

472
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,850
- Writer, if you come... 
 - Shh.

473
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:58,240
I mean, if you, Yeong Eun, come here, how does that make my stay more comfortable?

474
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,470
Do you not sense the gazes of the people passing by?

475
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:04,380
Look, earlier too. The ladies in that hospital room, their gazes changed as soon as I entered.

476
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:08,060
Fans say that my face is welfare.

477
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,270
All right.

478
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:16,370
Yes, you are such a welfare state for our country.

479
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:20,760
Honestly, you just came to confirm your popularity. Right?

480
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,820
Well, maybe a bit.

481
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,990
How did that end the other day?

482
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,120
"That?"

483
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,610
You know, how you said that if you choose the person you love, the world is doomed.

484
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:37,600
If you protect the world, then the person you love dies.

485
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,190
Was the ending decided upon?

486
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:41,470
What? I asked you that?

487
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,840
What? You already forgot?

488
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,960
Gosh, I was so curious I thought I'd die.

489
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,990
I thought about it deeply.

490
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:53,210
This is the perfect material for a regression story.

491
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:57,870
You rewind time, then you avoid the moment so that you never have to make that choice.

492
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,940
Maybe, no matter what you do, even if you avoided it,

493
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,910
you fall in love, just like fate.

494
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,560
You might have to make the decision even then.

495
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,560
You do talk as expected of someone who became a top ten writer with regression stories.

496
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,390
What a waste of your talent.

497
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:15,810
You really don't want to keep writing?

498
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,610
- I do. 
 - You do?

499
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:22,130
But I'm going to write in secret. So I don't get caught.

500
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:28,720
Ah, I really have to get going now with my schedule.

501
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,260
I'll be back next time.

502
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,190
What? Next time? Again?

503
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,150
Why would you do that? You don't have to.

504
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,610
- I will. 
 - Why?

505
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:37,210
I don't have friends.

506
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:38,970
- You don't have friends? 
 - No.

507
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:40,840
Really? Why not?

508
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,510
- I get shy. 
 - You get shy?

509
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:45,570
In what ways? Really?

510
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:49,600
If not, are you talking about covering your face? ("shy" and "cover face" in Korean are homonyms.)

511
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,420
You're really too funny.

512
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,600
You're so funny, it's great.

513
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,000
I didn't tell you to make you laugh. I was really asking.

514
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,420
You're so funny.

515
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,580
Wow.

516
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,680
What's so funny?

517
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,020
  Do you like me?

518
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,370
Am I crazy?

519
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:42,560

520
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,180
Lee Hyeon.

521
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:54,310
Lee Hyeon.

522
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:56,690
- Lee Hyeon? 
 - Kyu!

523
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,090
That scared me.

524
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:00,780
What'd you say?

525
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,620
Did you forget your own name?

526
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,180
Why are you muttering your own name?

527
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,720
Kyu.

528
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:13,820
Lee Hyeon Kyu!

529
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,110
Kyu. Hyeon Kyu.

530
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:18,670
Yeah. That's it.

531
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,740
It's Lee Hyeon Kyu! Lee Hyeon Kyu.

532
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,660
Yes, your name is Lee Hyeon Kyu.

533
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:32,820
 Let's eat together.  Where we used to go, Fool's Spicy Rice Cakes.

534
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:36,460
Hey. I'll be back. When everyone gets here, you take care of it.

535
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,780
Where are you going?

536
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,230
Huh? Hyungnim!

537
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,990
Where are you going?

538
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,750
He's obviously going to meet a girl.

539
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,040
Everyone's dating...

540
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:58,360
Thank you for coming.

541
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,720
I'll come again, even though I'm busy.

542
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,270
Bye!

543
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:09,340
Fighting, Noona!

544
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,320
Do you want me to open it for you?

545
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,030
Unni!

546
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,720
Have you been to the rooftop here?

547
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,970
Rooftop?

548
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:47,250
It's nice there. You should go once.

549
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,230
Do you want me to sign?

550
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:23,210
Who are you?

551
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:25,360
- You don't know who I am? 
 - Am I supposed to know?

552
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,970
- If you don't know, why are you looking at me? 
 - I can look at whatever I want.

553
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:30,150
Lame.

554
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,960
What?

555
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,690
I said you're lame. If you don't know me, why would you block my way?

556
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:38,430
You have plenty of room to pass by. You're small.

557
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:41,350
- Why are you picking a fight? 
 - Why do I feel like picking a fight?

558
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,490
Move.

559
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:53,570
I am getting a familiar feeling of irritation.  That little rat.

560
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:59,400
No matter how I think about it, it's weird.

561
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:02,590
Someone recognized me.

562
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:07,230
Who?

563
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:11,490
Isn't it interesting? There haven't been any humans that recognized me.

564
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:16,450
While I was having some fun, I got caught by a strange one.

565
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,310
It's okay. She's supposed to die next month anyway.

566
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:30,470
But that plant. What is it that you're giving it so much attention?

567
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:32,420
It's almost dead.

568
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,410
You.

569
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:39,550
How is that me?

570
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,430
You said you don't like rice cakes.

571
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:57,220
Yea, I don't.

572
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,710
Trying to get over a trauma.

573
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:09,030
Should we order some octopus tempura?

574
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:11,890
You really liked the octopus tempura here.

575
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:16,180
It was good. But I can't eat octopus anymore.

576
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:17,790
Why not?

577
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:20,040
Was it when I was 23?

578
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,560
I wasn't able to digest it well. Ever since, I get hives when I eat it.

579
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,320
Oh really?

580
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,270
If you want to have some, order it.

581
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:29,880
No, it's okay.

582
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:34,580
You couldn't even eat tteokbokki back then because you were watching your figure for swimming.

583
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,670
You eat it well now.

584
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:41,190
Since I don't swim anymore...

585
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:51,020
Don't you think that this restaurant changed a little?

586
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,560
Did it?

587
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:59,890
I can't tell. It's still delicious.

588
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,430
Is it?

589
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,870
Wasn't it around here?

590
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:19,760
Didn't we write something, too?

591
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,280
Kids these days do this kind of stuff, too?

592
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,170
So cute.

593
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:28,740
There is one that's from five years ago.  Perhaps ours is here, too?

594
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,750
It's not there.

595
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:32,960
I looked for it when I was here some time ago.

596
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,140
People have scribbled over it so you can't see it anymore.

597
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,460
What are you doing tomorrow?

598
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:45,120
Tomorrow? I think I'm going to the hospital.

599
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,160
Why? Are you sick?

600
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,680
No, someone I know.

601
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,470
Is it someone I know, too?

602
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:52,680
No.

603
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:13,500
It's really amazing.

604
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:16,700
Being in a car that you're driving.

605
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:19,350
I am not so young.

606
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:21,660
Why didn't you bring your car?

607
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:26,720
That's because... it was close?

608
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,530
It's far.

609
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:33,980
Why did you bring your car? When you were close by.

610
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,640
In case we drink.

611
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:41,840
If we drink, we become honest. And when we're honest, we might make mistakes.

612
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,930
I didn't want to make a mistake.

613
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,400
Do you smoke?

614
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,570
Yes...

615
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:03,140
I didn't know.

616
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:07,460
Of course, you didn't. I started smoking when I was 20.

617
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:11,190
That's right. If you started when you were 20...

618
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,980
You used to hate the smell of cigarettes.

619
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:20,660
That's right. I never imagined I'd become a smoker.

620
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,940
You don't smoke?

621
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:26,180
No, I quit after a little while.

622
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:29,630
But then again, sports players don't seem to smoke.

623
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,080
I don't work out anymore.

624
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,920
That's right.

625
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,670
Thank you for dropping me off.

626
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:05,210
Get home safely. I'll call you later.

627
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,880
You said you write novels, right?

628
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:20,410
Yes.

629
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,330
What's your novelist name?

630
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:23,330
Why?

631
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,990
Is it Lee Hyeon by any chance?

632
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:26,640
How did you know that?

633
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,320
- By chance, did Cha Joo Ik— 
 - So, it is.

634
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,910
Hyung didn't say anything.

635
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:37,610
The main characters in your novel...

636
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:39,470
Did you read it?

637
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,100
A few.

638
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,230
Don't read them anymore.

639
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:51,450
Why not? They're all about me.

640
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:54,800
Why can't I read them?

641
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,890
That's why I don't want you to read it. Since you already know.

642
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:00,820
Then, what about your new novel?

643
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:03,100
The new one you're writing...

644
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:06,490
it's a story I don't know about.

645
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:10,210
That...

646
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:14,180
I'm going to go. I shouldn't have asked.

647
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:16,880
Lee Hyeon Kyu!

648
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:20,100
Let's grab a drink next time.

649
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:24,210
I'll try to be a person that you can make mistakes and be honest with.

650
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:27,690
I wasn't ready for that today.

651
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:10,960
The moon is so bright.

652
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,510
It's so nice.

653
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,840
It's you again?

654
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,970
Why are you smoking at a hospital?

655
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:31,020
Not your business.

656
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:34,850
It is because you are a stranger.  It's because I don't like strangers causing me trouble.

657
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:38,580
Speak for yourself.  If you are going to die, go do it somewhere else.

658
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,520
Does the rooftop belong to you?

659
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,360
Yes, it's mine.

660
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,420
So die elsewhere. I told you twice.

661
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:51,140
Why do you keep talking about me dying when you've already died twice?

662
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:52,720
I'm not a ghost.

663
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,320
If you're not a ghost, then you should be well aware. People die eventually.

664
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,420
I never said I was human either.

665
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:03,440
You really must be sick. Stop picking a fight with me.

666
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:09,400
Because right now, I want doom upon the world.

667
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,990
- I really like those words. 
 - Those words?  What words?

668
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:16,240
"I wish doom upon the world," those words.

669
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,860
I like you even better after seeing you more often.

670
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:33,660
You have potential.

671
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,580
Why are you being like this all of a sudden? You're scaring me.

672
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:38,880
You're scared? You're scared now?

673
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:42,500
Isn't it a little late for that?

674
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:45,680
By any chance, do people tell you that you are a bit dim-witted?

675
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:55,050
You're using all kinds of methods to kick me out from the rooftop. I'm leaving.

676
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:59,070
Because I can't stand your behavior and I am afraid, I will leave.

677
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,810
What are you doing? Why are you following me?

678
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:11,180
I'm not following you.

679
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:12,220
 The door is closing.

680
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:15,110
Choose if you're going to speak informal or formal. Just pick one.

681
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:19,140
Yeah? Then informal. What floor are you going to?

682
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:21,060
Not sure.

683
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,440
 Fourth floor.

684
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,570
 Going down.

685
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,210
You're going to be in pain soon.

686
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,520
What?

687
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,870
What are you say–

688
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:55,840
See? I told you.

689
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:12,670
H-Help...

690
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:14,650
Is that your wish?

691
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:17,650
Help me.

692
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:20,130
Is that a wish?

693
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:23,500
If I help you, what are you going to do for me?

694
00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:05,490
Are you okay?

695
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:12,720
If you're okay then beg me to bring doom to the world.

696
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:16,630
What?

697
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:19,570
Beg me.

698
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:21,520
What the...?

699
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,080
You're going to die soon.

700
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,930
Don't you feel wronged?

701
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:28,600
A nice person like you, dying like this in vain.

702
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,920
But bad guys will live on.

703
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:37,770
On your way out, let's get rid of

704
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:39,960
this world and bad guys altogether.

705
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:47,480
If I beg, then can you even grant it?

706
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:50,930
What kind of nonsense are you saying since earlier?

707
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:53,410
How are you going to explain this?

708
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:59,890
When I grabbed your hand, you became fine.

709
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:03,550
It's a coincidence.

710
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,270
Oh, a coincidence?

711
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,880
Okay.

712
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,270
 The door is opening.

713
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:33,870
Then how are you going to explain this?

714
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:35,840
Is this a coincidence, too?

715
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:41,970
What is this? How?

716
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:43,910
You wanted it.

717
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,700
What are you?

718
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:52,780
You're not a ghost or a human.

719
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:56,610
Doom, that you've been wanting so much.

720
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:04,270
Am I dead? Am I here because I died?

721
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:08,510
Not yet, but soon.

722
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:11,380
That's why I'm thinking about helping you.

723
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:16,040
I'll make sure you don't feel sick until you die.

724
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:19,530
- How? 
 - Like earlier. By holding your hand.

725
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:20,720
And the price?

726
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,760
A contract.

727
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:26,220
You can just ask me to bring doom to the world before you die.

728
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:27,540
Why don't you do it?

729
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:29,950
If I could, I would have already done it.

730
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:32,870
- And I can do it? 
 - Probably.

731
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:35,210
- Why? 
 - I don't know.

732
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:39,710
I don't know. Just...

733
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,290
It feels like it.

734
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:50,250
If you're going to, then hold my hand.

735
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,540
I don't want to. I think I'm going to be hurting.

736
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:10,530
If not my head, somewhere. If I hold that hand.

737
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:15,160
You're more suspicious than you look.

738
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:19,470
I did get swayed for a bit. I like this place.

739
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:21,250
You came here when you wanted to cry.

740
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,160
I have a lot of good memories, too.

741
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,300
What good memories?

742
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:28,610
I can't see any of that.

743
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:31,470
That's probably because of my illness.

744
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:39,380
I definitely came with someone but I can't remember.

745
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:42,310
I think I was really happy.

746
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:50,420
As you know, right here isn't doing too well.

747
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,310
Right now.

748
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:56,880
What's that bracelet?

749
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,690
Bracelet? Oh, this?

750
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:06,220
I don't know. If I don't wear it, I feel uneasy.

751
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,690
♫  Here with me  ♫

752
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:40,500
♫  When your eyes brush past me  ♫

01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:18,890
♫  I hear a low sound  ♫

759
01:02:18,890 --> 01:02:22,040
♫  It's you  ♫

♫  I wanna be with you  ♫

♫  At the end of a tiring day  ♫

763
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:43,540
♫  Without a sound, come to me  ♫

764
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:46,410
♫  And hug me  ♫

765

♫  Wait for me at the end of this road  ♫

766
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,250
You did something to me, didn't you?

♫  My feelings for you are unstoppable  ♫

768
01:02:56,810 --> 01:03:00,440
Tell me. What did you do to me?

769
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:04,160
Not you, but her.

770
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:09,660
I did it to her, Tak Dong Kyeong.

771
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:22,550
♫  Suddenly, you've come closer to me  ♫

772

♫  And seeped into me  ♫

773
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:32,970
I guess...

774
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:36,480
there are things that can't be helped.

775
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:41,740
♫  And it reaches the night sky  ♫

Tak Dong Kyeong.

788
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:55,650
How did you know my name?

789
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:58,060
Who are you?

790
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,190

 This is all your doing, isn't it?

01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:36,940
 Why do you keep following me around?

797
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,960
 I'm going to check on you.

798
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,290
 Why do you trip so easily?

799
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:42,910
 I have something to ask.

800
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:44,880
 Did you kiss her?

801
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,130
 I don't want to be a coward in front of you.

802
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:49,250
 To die is nothing.

803

 You... how?

804
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:56,920
 Looking at things disappearing feels very lonely.

805
01:05:58,290 --> 01:06:00,360
 Don't cry.

806
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,370
 I'm sorry.
