1
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,590

2
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,430

3
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,060

4
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,620

5
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,960

6
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:50,800

7
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,230

8
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:05,160
 This drama is fiction.  All characters, places, institutions, religions, and events that appear are not real.

9
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,720
  It's glioblastoma.

10
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,090
It seems like multiple tumors.

11
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,620
The fact that you are dizzy and throwing up,

12
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,210
is all because of this.

13
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,590
To know more in detail, we have to conduct a biopsy.

14
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,950
But the location seems to not be good.

15
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,780
I see...

16
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,400
Yes.

17
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,000
Biopsy...

18
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,480
Do you do that on the weekends, too?

19
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,830
We don't on weekends.

20
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,500
How many days does the examination take?

21
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,920
At least a week.

22
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,270
That won't do.

23
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,060
What?

24
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,060
Then I can't.

25
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,530
A biopsy?

26
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,070
I already used up a few days of my annual leave, so I can't take a week off.

27
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,770
Taking time off work doesn't seem to be the issue here.

28
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,270
I don't know.

29
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,460
I can't take a week off...

30
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,090
Then let's not do the examination.

31
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,830
If you do the surgery, you'll live for one year.

32
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,740
If not, about three to four months.

33
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,370
Even so, you won't be able to live normally for that year.

34
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,460
You may get hemiplegia, speech disorder, or cognitive impairment.

35
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,060
The biopsy itself can be dangerous, too.

36
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,400
Dangerous?

37
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,960
Yes.

38
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,890
Am I going to die?

39
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,190
Yes.

40
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,160
Oh...

41
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,610
I see...

42
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,850
Yes.

43
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,990

44
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,900

45
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,890
For the logistics of the event, these forms should be helpful, and I will also send them to you by mail.

46
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,670
As I told you before, there's a date that I already promised with the platform.

47
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,000
Even if you are busy, the 70 episodes,

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,600
you need to send them over by the beginning of next month, Writer.

49
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,280
- Yes. 
 - You must be busy with your main job,

50
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,360
but there isn't too much time left until the event,

51
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,460
so please work hard for a while longer.

52
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,260
- Yes, I will contact you. 
 - Yes.

53
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,300
Editor, please contact me as well.

54
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:02,230
Yes. Writer, fighting!

55
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,670
You seemed like a real doctor today and seemed cool.

56
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,000
Thank you for using your connections to cut me in line for the MRI.

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,830
No worries. I'm a real doctor.

58
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,610
Then.

59
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,430
Editor.

60
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,370
Fighting!

61
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,120
Yes, fighting!

62
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,720
 Glioblastoma...

63
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,800
 Glioblastoma...

64
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,300
  What kind of face—

65
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,030
I know that I'm handsome, but I'm busy.

66
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,650
 Doctor!

67
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,100
  The guardians in the emergency room...

68
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:46,190
  Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

69
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,520
  This way!

70
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,690
  That way!

71
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,540

72
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,790
What happened?

73
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,470
Is it an incident?

74
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,790
 At around 2:30 p.m. this afternoon, a man

75
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,630
  stabbed people mercilessly in the middle of Seoul

76
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,440
 and seven people, including those who attempted to stop him, have been injured.

77
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,620
  The injured have been quickly transported to the hospital

78
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:31,460
  - and the extent of their injuries will be checked.
 - How hideous!

79
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,630
Crazy—

80
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,560
You are going to pay, right?

81
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,110
Yes.

82
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,090

83
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,790

84
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,170
Crazy—

85
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,240
- What? 
 - What? Nothing.

86
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,360
Can I pay in monthly installments?

87
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,790
For how many months?

88
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,690
  If you do surgery, you will live for a year.

89
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,400
 If you don't, around three to four months.

90
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,760
- Can you do three months? 
 - Okay.

91
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,720
 Get ready!

92
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,030
  It's an emergency patient!

93
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,960
 It's risky! Quickly!

94
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,090
 The cut in the stomach is deep. The bleeding is heavy.

95
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,470
 Patient, please get your grip together!

96
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,090
 - Patient! 
 - His blood level is dropping!

97
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,860
  - Not yet. 
 - It's a patient!

98
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,600
This way!

99
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,200
He's here.

100
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,170
One, two, three!

101
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,690
He's the perpetrator. He tried to kill himself at the site.

102
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,000
The police are on the way now.

103
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,620
Excuse me, but which department do you belong in?

104
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,840
Put the curtain around the bed,

105
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,940
and make sure no one except the police can enter.

106
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,810
Yes, Doctor.

107
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,990
It's fine, so you can just take your hands off him and leave.

108
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,820
What? But–

109
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,470
He's not going to die.

110
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,220
Y-Yes.

111
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,550
Why are you running away?

112
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,390
Open your eyes!

113
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,700
I waited for you. Why were you so late, like the main protagonist?

114
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,510
You think you've become something, right?

115
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,300
I'm the one who has become something. You are nothing.

116
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,330
To make a comparison, it's as if you parked terribly at my parking spot.

117
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,130
So my mood is terrible.

118
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,630
Take out your car.

119
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:18,340
You must've not known this, but doom is not within your jurisdiction, but mine.

120
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,080
Since you carelessly handled my jurisdiction, I'm going to do the same now.

121
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,270
I am going to collect the doom that I sentenced to you for a moment.

122
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,060
Don't worry, I will return it to you when it's time.

123
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,970
You will be only waiting for that day.

124
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,900
From now, you will find out what's even more dreadful than doom.

125
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,610
It's life.

126
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,870
I'm the police.

127
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:12,980

128
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,940
So beautiful.

129
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,420
- You're here? 
 - What nonsense are you spouting again?

130
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:39,430
- You should've at least changed your clothes. 
 - I didn't change so I could show you.

131
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,120
Some kind of god, having the world at their whim.

132
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,460
Huh? Are you tired of the hospital life now, too?

133
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,340
You should try being sick. There's no time to be bored.

134
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,060
Again, again. Acting all pitiful.

135
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,360
I said I'm just like a gardener.

136
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,610
Planting it, watering it, and wishfully waiting for it.

137
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,230
That's all.

138
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,270
So you're saying you have no responsibility.

139
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,540
Some don't even get the chance to sprout.

140
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:15,340
Some bloom later, and others bloom and immediately fade away.

141
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,730
Some are medicinal herbs, others are poisonous plants.

142
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,830
Some even kill everything around them.

143
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,680
Is that my fault?

144
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,820
Pluck those out and plant the ones you want.

145
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,990
Out of those, you should cherish a few.

146
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,870
The garden does not belong to the gardener.

147
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:39,340
Then what about me? What am I in this garden of yours?

148
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,860
You are a butterfly. For the flowers in my garden.

149
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,920
Until when exactly?

150
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,690
Forever.

151
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,780
You're too cruel to someone, on his birthday.

152
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,440
Birthday? Human?

153
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,260
Were you ever born? Were you ever human?

154
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:15,080
Go. Go and become someone's wish.

155
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,530
Today is the only day you can do such a thing.

156
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,380
Even my birthday isn't for me.

157
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,020
For humans.

158
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,160
Damn these flowers.

159
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,870
It's time for them to wilt.

160
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,010
 In a moment, the bus will arrive.

161
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:27,730

162
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,030

163
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,580
- Yeah, Oppa. 
  - Are you busy?

164
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:48,420
No, I'm at... Um, outside at the moment. For a meeting real quick.

165
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,450
 Is that so? Then, could I see you right now?

166
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,860
Right now?

167
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,560
 It's because I'm in a hurry. Right now, right away.

168
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,780
Is something the matter?

169
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,490
 L-L-Let's talk after you get here.

170
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,170
 Make sure you come to that cafe!

171
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,840
Hello?

172
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,820
As you can see, my body is in this condition so I can only do this much.

173
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,870
Could you explain... this situation?

174
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,580
You should be the one explaining.

175
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,700
You're the one that committed adultery, but if you tell me to explain,

176
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,090
what kind of soap opera would that be?

177
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,760
So this was that genre.

178
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:44,000
Yes. Everything has been explained.

179
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,050
So this is the place you two first met?

180
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,790
- Did you search for everything? Like the conversations on his phone? 
 - You don't think I did?

181
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,920
Then you should know that he'd never contact me on the weekends.

182
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,560
And wouldn't answer at night. You would've seen all of that too.

183
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,860
Whenever I couldn't reach him, he'd say his phone died or was on silent, or he was working.

184
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,000
I guess you would've seen all of that.

185
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,050
That was always on my mind.

186
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:09,060
I thought it was strange... but now, everything explains itself.

187
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,660
I think you're trying to say that you didn't know he was a married man, but–

188
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,890
Yes. I didn't know.

189
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,390
You dated him for three months, but you didn't know?

190
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,520
Say something that makes sense!

191
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,420
Your husband cheated on you for three months, and you didn't know either!

192
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,290
Hey!

193
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,230
You're saying you're not at fault, right?

194
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,580
Is that what you're trying to say?

195
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,960
- I think so. 
 - I think so? Why this little–

196
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,630
Who should I throw water at?

197
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,270
You can let out your anger on me,

198
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,090
but I can't let out my anger on you.

199
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,520
It's that bastard's fault, so what should I do?

200
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,890
Who are you trying to convince?

201
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,790
It's not something I should be saying to you.

202
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:13,590
So... please live on while blaming me.

203
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,790
- What? 
- Your caring and innocent husband

204
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,560
was caught by an evil bitch and almost had a terrible incident happen.

205
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,990
Whether it be ten or fifty years, live a long happy life with that bastard.

206
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,030
That would be nice. For your baby, too.

207
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,490
- Are you okay? 
 - Ah, it hurts.

208
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:45,100
Are you all right?

209
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,060
Are you all right?

210
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,460
Hey, taxi! Over here!  Yes, here!

211
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,630
Ah, be careful! Careful, watch out.

212
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,730
Be careful. Watch your step.

213
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,850
Watch out. Your body. Be careful.

214
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,890
Driver, please drive us to the nearest OB/GYN.

215
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,720
The mother is doing all right.

216
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,630
It's a common symptom that occurs when they are stressed.

217
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,890
- You don't have to worry too much. 
 - Yes.

218
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,330
Are you her guardian?

219
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,200
No.

220
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,260
Ah... Well, I guess you could say I got to know her through someone else.

221
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,140
Do you know her guardian's number?

222
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,770
Yes.

223
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,370

224
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:51,540
Then... could you fill these out for me?

225
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:59,330

226
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:02,040

227
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,830

228
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,270

229
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,660

230
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,790
We're not finished with our conversation yet.

231
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:36,730
We can talk after your condition is stable.

232
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,210
I always had that on my mind, too.

233
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,760
I thought it was strange while listening to you, too.

234
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,240
But I wanted to blame it on you because I thought it would really become your fault.

235
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,520
About blaming everything on me earlier...

236
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,680
I was being sincere about that.

237
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,730
Please make this my fault. Either way, I'm...

238
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,420
going to die in three months.

239
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:19,470
I was wondering who I'd be telling this to first.

240
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,690
But I didn't know I'd be in this situation, telling it to you.

241
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:28,510
- Well, that's because I didn't know I'd be dying either. 
 - Are you serious?

242
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:32,690
From the beginning until now, everything I've said has been the truth.

243
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:38,770
So... So don't worry about me.

244
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:45,370
Also, I sincerely wish for you to live a long and happy life.

245
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,550
I must really be dying.

246
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,030
Hey, is the company your playground?

247
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,860
How could you return now after leaving for a quick meeting?

248
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:53,900
You should've gone back home. Why did you even come back?

249
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,130
- I'm sorry. 
 - Does "I'm sorry" solve everything?

250
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,660
I'm sorry.

251
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,730
Are you rebelling?

252
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:06,390
Ah, you should quit. Just quit.

253
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,230
It's so easy to make a living.

254
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,650
People these days are so spoiled.

255
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,390
My body has been quite sick.

256
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:19,800
While I was at my hospital appointment, the writer contacted me so...

257
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,100
I apologize.

258
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,860
This is why I can't hire women.

259
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,450
The littlest things make you sick.

260
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,940
Ah, you're like a broken machine. A broken machine!

261
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,150
At least you can send out a machine to be fixed.

262
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,980
Ah, and it can be fixed up properly.

263
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,210
I-I'm hurting, too! I'm in pain, too.

264
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,480
I have rhinitis and a h-h-herniated disc.

265
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,610
I feel like dying, too.

266
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,010

267
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,370
 As you can see, my body...

268
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:00,060
What is this? Tak, isn't this you?

269
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,730
What?

270
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,240

271
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,380
 You're the one that committed adultery, but if you tell me to explain,

272
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,160
 what kind of soap opera would that be?

273
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,960
That isn't me.

274
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,250
 You dated him for three months, but you didn't know?

275
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,690
I think it is you. Your clothes are exactly the same, too!

276
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:19,420
 Your husband cheated on you for three months, and you didn't know either!

277
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,160
 Hey!

278
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,230
That's not me.

279
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:27,050
Did you listen to it? Even the voice is totally...

280
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,690
 Who should I throw water at?

281
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:32,750
Hey! What are you doing right now?

282
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,680
So what if it is me? What are you going to do about it?

283
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:46,220
You... Did you just...Did you just yell at me?

284
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,940
- President, you think that I'm nothing, don't you? 
 -What?

285
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,040
Well, of course, I'm like nothing to you. I'm like nothing to me, too.

286
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,260
Why is everything like this today?

287
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,240
I'll be using my day off today.

288
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,050
I'll use it.

289
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:06,570
It's not even that many days. I'll use that right now.

290
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,980
You... hey.

291
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,370
Ah, that one.

292
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,090
That's her all right.

293
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,830
She said it wasn't, so it's not.

294
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,820
Is that so? Is it not?

295
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,190
Is there something wrong with my eyesight?

296
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:51,170

297
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:01,210
After the rain, all the ginkgo leaves will fall.

298
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:05,550
Fall is so short. Now we can't eat ice cream outside anymore.

299
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:16,270

300
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,550

301
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,970

302
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:25,140

303
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,050

304
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,560

305
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:35,150
The interest for a three-month-long romance, sure is hefty.

306
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,490

307
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:46,500

308
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,490
Hey. Are you filming something?

309
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:15,950
Why? Are you going to upload it somewhere?

310
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,520
Big dreams for someone with nothing to look at.

311
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,330
What?

312
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,830
Hey! You better stop right there!

313
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,930
Who are you?

314
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,000
Move over! Move out of the way!

315
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,200
You better stop there!

316
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:36,220
Gosh, really?

317
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,960

318
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,560
Someone, get him, please! Hey!

319
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:16,470
Hey! Stop right there!

320
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,320
Are you crazy? Would you stop if you were me?

321
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,930
Hey! Someone, please get him!

322
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,520
Hey!

323
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,360
Wow.

324
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,050
No way.

325
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,430
Ow, my leg!

326
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,220
Now I'm not in the mood for a cigarette.

327
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,640
 Are you okay, sir?

328
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,420
Woah.

329
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:30,530
  You're a butterfly for the flower in my garden.

330
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:32,190
What is this?

331
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,510
  Have you ever been born a human?

332
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,030
What does a mere human matter?

333
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,920
  For humans.

334
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:56,060
Those trivial, temporary beings. What's so great about them?

335
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,100
I'm the only one without one? Wow.

336
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,600
Oh, heavens.

337
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:55,730

338
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,730
- What is it? 
 -   Noona, can you give me $500?

339
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:01,230
- What? 
 - I came to Jeju Island with my friends.

340
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,500
I have a rented car, but I just scratched it.

341
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,770
- Hey! 
 -  I told them that we should get an expensive insurance,

342
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:09,860
but Sang Geun kept saying it was fine not to.

343
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,690
Gosh, I should've been pickier when choosing my friends.

344
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:17,760
Thankfully, I'm not hurt, though. My reaction speed is no joke!

345
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,560
  Tak Seon Kyeong.

346
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,960
I'll pay you back next month! So, can I get the $500?

347
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,490
Do you want to die?

348
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,940
  Why are you so mad? You know how urgent this situation is for me to call you?

349
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:32,520
Hey. Do you really have to do this today? Don't you know what day today is?

350
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,260
Today? Wednesday?

351
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:38,090
Oh, is it Thursday?

352
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:40,270
Today is our parents' memorial rite.

353
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,700
 Oh, wow. Is it already today?

354
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,970
Wow, last year, I was in the military. Time really flies!

355
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,440
Hang up, you bastard!

356
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,660
Ah, Noona!

357
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:37,560
  Not being able to cry was an old habit of mine.

358
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:58,030
  At the age of ten, I knew how to swallow my tears.

359
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:06,650
  The tears that couldn't fall but were swallowed...

360
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:09,450
  I wonder where they all went.

361
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,750
  I think I know now.

362
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,380
 But still, they're our blood relatives.

363
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,300
 We should take them in and raise them.

364
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,430
  Will you raise them then, Sister-in-Law?

365
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,470
  As if it's easy raising someone else's child.

366
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:05,960
  She's right. Rather than them growing up walking on eggshells,

367
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,750
  we could just send them to some facility—

368
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,750
  The children might hear.

369
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:31,430
  From that day on, the tears that I could not weep swelled like a lump...

370
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:35,720
  Eventually settling at a place in my head.

371
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,630
Yes, Aunt.

372
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,750
  Today is the death anniversary of your mother and father, right? Did you buy it?

373
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,720
The cake? Yes.

374
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,490
If anyone saw me, they would think I was crazy.

375
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:03,400
  Hey, if the family all gets together, that's a party.

376
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,500
  It would be funnier being depressed on this kind of day.

377
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,080
The family's gone crazy. Seon Kyeong's in Jeju-do.

378
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,520
  He's a funny guy.

379
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,260
  Why would he go to Jeju-do alone without me or his sister?

380
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,030
I guess it doesn't matter if he's not here.

381
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:18,660
Aunt, don't give him money.

382
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,810
Why? Did he cause trouble again?

383
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:24,780
That jerk, I should teach him a lesson—

384
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,040
How are you going to teach him a lesson when you're in Canada?

385
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,650
  It's so freaking cold in Canada.

386
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:35,300
Hey, at this age, I moved to an entirely different country to live prosperously, and yet, I'm suffering.

387
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,310
It seems like you're living okay, seeing that you're still talking about love.

388
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,360
How are things at work? Are you sick?

389
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,730
Work? Of course, things are good at work.

390
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:52,160
I'm not sick either. Even when I do get sick, it's only a cold.

391
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:57,820
  That's a relief. I wish life was always like this.

392
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:02,370
You, me, and Seon Kyeong, we've had a really hard time.

393
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:06,470
I feel like your parents in Heaven are finally helping us.

394
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:10,110
  All that's left is for Seon Kyeong to settle in. I wouldn't wish for anything more.

395
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:15,630
  Oh, Kevin is getting ready for work.

396
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:19,790
I'll talk to you later, Dong Kyeong. Don't skip meals and call me if anything happens.

397
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:22,070
Okay, don't worry.

398
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:26,880
Tell Uncle I said hi.

399
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:47,140
They say I'm going to die.

400
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,080
When you're dying...

401
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:57,170
would it hurt a lot?

402
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:17,810
  Oppa will explain everything to you later.

403
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,600
 Miss Tak Dong Kyeong, your loan for the 13-1 quarter is overdue.

404
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,780
 Please settle your dues at the earliest.

405
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,210
  The Korea Scholarship Association.

406
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:25,770
I hope the world goes to hell.

407
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:29,110
I wish everything stopped existing.

408
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:32,210
Bring doom upon the world!

409
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:58,070
  - Please make me win the lottery. 
 - Please make me lose 10 kgs

410
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,530
  I hope the world goes to hell.

411
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,970
  Please let me live happily with my family.

412
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:05,600
  I wish everything stopped existing.

413
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,740
  Bring doom upon the world!

414
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:19,810
I can smell a little alcohol in her wish.

415
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,770
  Makgeolli

416
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,590
What? What's the time right now?

417
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,410

418
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,310
Oh, geez!  Oh...

419
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:57,670
Hi.

420
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,710
- I played a joke to make you open the door sooner. 
 - What?

421
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:08,320
You know, you seeing Switzerland and then Italy. That kind of thing.

422
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:18,850
  What kind of face—

423
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,670
Yeah, I know I'm handsome.

424
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:25,200
But why are you... here?

425
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,140
- I came because you called. 
 -  What?

426
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:32,540
- M-Me?  
 - Yes, you called.

427
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,550
Who are you?

428
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,360
Doom.

429
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,260
It took you so long to open the door, so I thought your house was big. But it's small.

430
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,550
Excuse me! Ex—

431
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,270
What are you doing? Sit.

432
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,390
This is my house.

433
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,750
Yes, don't mind me.

434
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,950

435
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:07,200
It's an ancestral memorial ceremony.

436
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,330
It's my birthday today.

437
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:14,510
I see. Yes...

438
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:18,160
Happy birthday!

439
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:21,700
I was never wished a happy birthday from someone before.

440
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:24,570

441
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,640
Don't waste your energy for no reason.

442
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,580
This will end quickly if you just say, "please do that for me."

443
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,270
- What? 
 - You said you want to bring doom upon the world.

444
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,010
 Bring doom upon everything!

445
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:44,330
You were listening to me from earlier?

446
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:47,280
You knew my house and were walking around my neighborhood?

447
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,570
No, I didn't. I'm busy.

448
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,350
Who are you?

449
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:11,550
What do you want?

450
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,120
Cake?

451
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:25,180
We don't have time for this. You're going to die soon.

452
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:37,810

453
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:40,120
Exactly in 100 days.

454
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:47,840
Excuse me...

455
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:52,840
Did you perhaps come from the hospital?

456
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:54,740
Does a doctor know how to do something like that?

457
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:58,100
No, probably not.

458
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,470
My birthday doesn't always come.

459
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:04,150
My birthday crosses over the century and leaps over destiny.

460
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:06,600
So make a wish before it's too late.

461
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,340
Oh. Wow.

462
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,230
I didn't know glioblastoma would have symptoms like this.

463
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:15,360
W-Wow!

464
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,020
- What? 
 - Hallucination.

465
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,630
This is so cool!

466
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,840
It seems like you need more time.

467
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,920
This situation does seem unreal, right?

468
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,410
What?

469
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:34,030
It's fine. My birthday isn't over yet.

470
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,080
I'll see you later.

471
00:44:58,210 --> 00:44:59,880
Wow...

472
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,730
Was that a dream?

473
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:07,140
No way.

474
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,450
What was that...

475
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:38,300
I don't know! I don't know!

476
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:04,310
It's bothering me.

477
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:22,120
What? Where is this place?

478
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,600
My house.

479
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:32,340
Sit. Don't mind me.

480
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:35,710
Was I just kidnapped?

481
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:41,510
Something like that. To put it clearly, I entered your dream without permission.

482
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:43,850
Dream?

483
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:54,710
  It's a dream? This?

484
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:58,570
Wow... Wow!

485
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:00,030
Wow!

486
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:05,260
Wow! What is this?

487
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:13,280
- Is this real? 
 - Even if this is a dream, you have no manners at someone else's house.

488
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,510
You, earlier–

489
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:19,580
But I was feeling uncomfortable since earlier. Why do you keep talking informally to me?

490
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:22,730
- You spoke informally first. 
 - I did?

491
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:25,800
You said "bring doom upon all," so I thought you wanted to drop the honorifics.

492
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,190
I wasn't saying that to you.

493
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:32,830
Then, who were you talking to?

494
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,130
I'm Doom.

495
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:45,030
So this is a dream, right?

496
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:53,330
What is this?

497
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:57,180
Where is the front door?

498
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:00,130
I'm going to go home.

499
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:13,660
It seems like you're not liking the location.

500
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:20,760
Whoa!

501
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,290
You wanted it.

502
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:32,490
This is for the cake.

503
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:39,010
So, you're Doom?

504
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:42,540
I'm responsible for at least part of all doom.

505
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:45,430
Then you can bring doom upon all! Why are you doing this to me?

506
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:47,440
Do you think I haven't done that before?

507
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:51,100
It didn't work. It may be because of some program's will.

508
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,770
What–

509
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:56,590
To put it directly, you're the client and I'm the provider.

510
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:00,890
It's like a system by Mother Nature, something like that. This is different, though.

511
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:04,730
This is the will of a human.

512
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:06,970
Why does it have to be me out of everyone else?

513
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:11,530
You're the only person who made a wish like that, right when the star died.

514
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:17,510
Then, do you disappear if you don't grant me the wish?

515
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:20,080
In fantasy novels, that was the case.

516
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,940
No way. It's like an event.

517
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:29,710
"Doom, on the day you are born, become someone else's hope."

518
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,180
Wow.

519
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,180
Is this a nightmare?

520
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,090
Your life is a nightmare.

521
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:42,470
What?

522
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:50,270
Sadly, it's time for you to wake up.

523
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:52,320
What?

524
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:12,080
It's a dream...

525
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,620
It's a dream.

526
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:36,270
It's a dream... It's a dream!

527
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,370
What do I do?

528
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:43,670
What is this?

529
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:46,470
Crazy bastard, seriously!

530
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:49,250
Is he an American or what?

531
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:53,100
Seriously!

532
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,630
I will make it not hurt.

533
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,530
You won't be in pain for not even a day while you are dying.

534
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:27,090
How does that sound?

535
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:41,140
Can I have a roll of kimbap?

536
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,830
Okay, fine.

537
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:49,570
I will grant one of your actual wishes.

538
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:53,950
Not getting rid of alcohol smell, but something you really, really want.

539
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,650
I can't do more than that.

540
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:12,030
  I shouldn't listen to a crazy man.

541
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:14,200
  I shouldn't.

542
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,840
  Why is everyone going to work by subway today?

543
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,570
  I just wish they'd all disappear.

544
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:58,610
  See? You want it, too.

545
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:02,250
  You.

546
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,350
I'm just sick. Yeah.

547
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:25,750
I'm sick for sure.

548
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:32,470
Manager Tak.

549
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:41,800
Thanks to the cafe owner on the first floor, I pushed the resignation for tomorrow.

550
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,380
Manager Jo, about yesterday...

551
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:46,400
The CEO isn't coming to work today.

552
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,820
He must've gone to his girlfriend to beg on his knees.

553
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:53,300
- What? 
 - He was so hysterical yesterday that we thought he fought with his girlfriend.

554
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:56,200
Then, Da In heard about it on the rooftop.

555
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,610
She said it was no joke.

556
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:02,900
That man really can't keep his private life out of his work.

557
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,940
I'll drink this well.

558
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:12,380
You need to eat well. You can't say that you'll just quit work because you're so mad and humiliated, okay?

559
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:15,610
If you quit, we'll die here. You know that, right?

560
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:20,550
Why won't you answer? Hey.

561
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:26,300
Manager Tak, writer Siberia is in the meeting room.

562
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,180
Already?

563
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:31,480
It's not time for the meeting right now, though.

564
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:35,310
Well, authors just only think about themselves.

565
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,090
Where's writer Siberia?

566
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:50,040
Inside.

567
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:55,570
There he is.

568
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:06,290
Are you a stalker or American? Choose one.

569
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:07,660
Why are you excluding me being a kimbap business owner and a doctor?

570
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:10,590
What did you do for them to be so entranced like that?

571
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:13,950
It's not "entranced like that," they were truly entranced.

572
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:18,250
  This is driving me crazy.

573
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:20,940
  Am I crazy?

574
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,450
You're not crazy.

575
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:29,470
Writer Siberia is just wandering somewhere for now. He needs time.

576
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:31,690
- How do you know? 
 - Because I sent him somewhere.

577
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:34,990
No, not that. How do you know my thoughts?

578
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:38,200
Oh. You're a bit dense, aren't you?

579
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,530
Are you...?

580
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:42,270
I'm really curious about this.

581
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:45,890
You hate your CEO and the company. Why do you come to work?

582
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:50,160
Should I make your CEO disappear?

583
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,060
It's possible as a wish.

584
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:53,830
Don't look into my heart.

585
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:56,580
Well, I don't "look" necessarily, I hear it.

586
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:59,060
Don't listen, then!

587
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:04,650
Then, accept my offer. With those I have a promise with, I don't look or listen.

588
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:08,550
Just leave.

589
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:14,890
I'll leave, then.

590
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:22,990
I'm going to a meeting with writer Lee Hyeon.

591
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,760
Thank you for the coffee.

592
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:35,930
Unnie!

593
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:39,670
  Hey, I just woke up. You're going to come anyway, so why call?

594
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:42,310
I'm going to go insane.

595
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:45,430
  What is it? Did the CEO nag at you this early in the morning?

596
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:46,730
This doctor...

597
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:48,870
No, this American, no, this crazy man,

598
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:51,560
I mean, this kimbap business owner, I mean—

599
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,610
What should I start with?

600
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:56,130
  What?

601
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:04,580
  New York Times' Selected Masterpiece to Know About Before You Die, Lowell's "Doom, Come"

602
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:28,480
No, it's nothing. Let's talk when I get there.

603
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:48,300
  Even after getting a death sentence, nothing changed.

604
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:53,440
  I do not fear what I don't see.

605
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,240
  Even death, even doom,

606
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,740
  the minute I see them,

607
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:03,890
  fear becomes real.

608
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:27,290
  Pain is real.

609
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:52,500
  Answer me. Who is making a joke out of my life?

610
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,530
Excuse me!

611
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:41,710
God is on my side.

612
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:45,210
Choose. Will you die here?

613
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:48,920
Or will you hold my hand?

614
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:03,200
The answer to that is...

615
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,990
It's me.

616
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:26,530

617
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:34,700
♫   It's about to fall off  ♫

618
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:37,010
♫   It's dangerous   ♫

619
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:42,570
  Like that, I took Doom's hand.

620
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,810
♫  The darkness falls down  ♫

621
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:52,260

627
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:23,500

628
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,870
  You told me to be humans' hope.

629
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:29,900
  But what humans hope for is doom.

630
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:31,450
 Why is it me?

631
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:34,400
  Why does it have to be me?

632
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,010
  - It's fate. 
 - Smile.

633
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:39,600
  Why are you acting so friendly all of a sudden?

634
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:40,760
  Let go!

635
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,120
  Leave him to me. You can go in and eat, Honey.

636
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,280
  Should we meet tomorrow? Should I pick you up?

637
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,250
  Why are you being like this?

638
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:48,570
  I'm just telling you to cling onto me a bit.

639
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:50,030
  What, to you?

640
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:52,470
  To the fate that has come to you.

641
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,820
♫   It's our fate, destiny   ♫
