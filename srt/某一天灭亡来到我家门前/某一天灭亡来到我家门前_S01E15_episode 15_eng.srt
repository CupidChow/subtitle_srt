1
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,690

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,500

3
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,030

4
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,730

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,780

6
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:48,050

7
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:59,170

8
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,440

9
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,270
T-This is a miracle!

10
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,350
Look.

11
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:22,160
Wow, how is this possible?

12
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,250
How can this happen?

13
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,820
How can the tumor get smaller every time we take an x-ray?

14
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,690
- I know. 
 - There might not be any by next week.

15
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,880
Is this possible?

16
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,210
Did I diagnose you wrong?

17
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,440
You didn't diagnose it wrong.

18
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,520
I've never seen such a case in the dozen of years as a doctor.

19
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,020
I've never seen this in any thesis either.

20
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:58,200
- I must've been lucky. 
 - Did you take something separately?

21
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,180
Did you tell your family?

22
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,380
- Aren't they so happy? 
 - Yes.

23
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,370
How about your boyfriend? Isn't he happy?

24
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:12,180
At this rate, you can have your wedding that you postponed, right now.

25
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,720
I think I'm going to postpone that a little more.

26
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,500
Why?

27
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:23,690
He went somewhere far.

28
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,550
 Is this all a dream?

29
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:04,260
 Did everything really happen?

30
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,780
 Did you really...

31
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,600
 stay by my side?

32
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,830
Tak!

33
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,860
Who did you get my contact information from?

34
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,270
Your number didn't change.

35
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,500
Still, you shouldn't contact me so recklessly.

36
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,690
I didn't contact you recklessly. I carefully contacted you.

37
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:46,190
I identified myself on the text, and you gave me permission to call you, so I did.

38
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,720
Whatever. I'm not signing the contract.

39
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,220
Can I ask you why not?

40
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,380
Can't you see? I debuted.

41
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,900
I have no time to write.

42
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,760
- And I'll be in trouble if people find out I'm a writer. 
 - You'll be in trouble?

43
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,120
Of course! The difference of imageâ€”

44
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,300
Never mind. I'm not doing it. End of conversation.

45
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,820
- If you're in trouble, I'm at an advantage. 
 - Excuse me?

46
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,530
Then you should be nice to me.

47
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,410
What... did you just...

48
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,220
Aren't you supposed to be like, you don't do internet

49
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,160
or social media, and never dreamed of becoming a celebrity?

50
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,490
But in reality, you are a superstar writer.

51
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,200
Do you even know what superstar means?

52
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,380
You're not supposed to know.

53
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:50,250
Moreover, you even gave yourself the pen name of Kwi Gong Ja (prince).

54
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,320
Did you just laugh? Did you just mock me?

55
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,720
Wow, I didn't make the pen name. Mom made it.

56
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,430
Well, it suits you. It suits you well...

57
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:10,690
But I could tell this to someone which might get you in trouble.

58
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,150
Are you threatening me?

59
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,990
Threatening? It's a conciliation.

60
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,490
I'm not holding anything in my hands.

61
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,620
Do you have to hold something for it to be a threat?

62
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,460
For me, yes.

63
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,160
Do you think I'll flick an eye?

64
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:34,290
I clearly expressed my stance that day.

65
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,390
That I'm not working if it's not with Editor Tak Dong Kyeong.

66
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,330
Oh, that will do?

67
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,450

68
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,570
 Yes, what is it?

69
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,990
It's me, Cha Joo Ik.

70
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,710
 I know. What do you want?

71
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,550
Come over after you're done, Team Leader Tak.

72
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,760
 Sorry?

73
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,590

74
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,250
Happy?

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,290
I look forward to a positive answer, Writer.

76
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,330
I'll get going.

77
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,130
Wow, seriously.

78
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,410
What the heck?

79
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,490
- Who was it? 
 - Cha Joo Ik.

80
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:37,960
How can he not change a bit?

81
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,400
He must still think I'm his subordinate.

82
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,990
He's just rude. Rude.

83
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,020
He just wants me to come without any explanations.

84
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,650
He wants me to come to his house.

85
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,150
Unnie, can you drop me off on your way?

86
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,750
I'll take you there.

87
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,350
Unnie, you should come with me.

88
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,130
You know him.

89
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,250
It's fine.

90
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,670
- Unnie. 
 - Yeah?

91
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,490
Do you not call Cha Joo Ik?

92
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,350
It's just...

93
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,630
It's just... you guys don't call each other?

94
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,290
I'm trying to straighten out my feelings.

95
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,050
Why?

96
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,550
We both need some time.

97
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:32,530
I don't think he'll call you before you call him.

98
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,120
Probably. He's like that.

99
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,930
Do you like him because he's like that?

100
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,520
Don't lead me on.

101
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,830
You're not falling for it? You're all grown up.

102
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,100
Taking you to and from the hospital,

103
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,520
being your guardian for three months made me an adult.

104
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,790
I will make sure to pay back everything.

105
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,750
As I live on, I'll make monthly payments.

106
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,260
It's fine. You've already paid back for everything.

107
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,420
You not being sick is enough for me.

108
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,290
I'm so proud of you and thankful to you.

109
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,680
Me too. I'm thankful, too.

110
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,920
To you, Aunt, Seon Kyeong, and..

111
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,830
So you're saying that all those writers you mentioned signed the contract with you?

112
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,990
No, that I made plans to have them sign the contract.

113
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,400
I got an office, too.

114
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,200
I'm thinking about naming the company Top Ten Media. What do you think?

115
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,800
Is that with the aspiration of becoming the top ten among the publishers or something?

116
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,960
No, I'm expressing my will to sign with only the writers who'll make it to the top ten.

117
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,520
Who are you expressing it to?

118
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:55,120
You. I heard you're feeling pretty okay these days, so I'm formally proposing.

119
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,070
Join my company. I'll be good to you.

120
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,570
How will you be good to me?

121
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,190
I have a lot of money.

122
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,230
Showing off with no proof. I could do that, too.

123
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:09,760
Then you show off with salary and position.

124
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,430
Would you like to be my show off, Team Leader Tak?

125
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:18,030
Gosh!  You must be confident to have those writers sign, huh?

126
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:21,390
Well... I can't say I'm not confident.

127
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,730
Then, why isn't Lee Hyeon in that list of yours?

128
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,190
You know her ranking's been going up lately.

129
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,560
- I do know. 
 - Then, why aren't you holding on to her?

130
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,820
It's not that I'm not holding on.

131
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,290
I'm just letting her be for a bit.

132
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,060
Why do you let her be?

133
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,160
Is she a cultural asset or a piece of art? She's a human.

134
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,360
Grab her whether as a woman or as a writer. Don't regret it later.

135
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,560
She'll need some time.

136
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,250
Seriously.

137
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,190
Time my butt.

138
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,690
Do you think time will just be there forever?

139
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,730
You sound like a spoiled child.

140
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,360
I know well.

141
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,660
It's not time that you need. Courage is what you need.

142
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,320
Hey, you're kind of cool.

143
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,900
- I can't believe I get to give advice to Cha Joo Ik. 
 - Cha Joo Ik?

144
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,600
You're not boss yet. I'm off.

145
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,490
I will think thoroughly about the proposal that you made before I give you an answer.

146
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,360
Hey, did I raise you like that?

147
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,560
Why think thoroughly? Just think roughly.

148
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,390
Yes, that's how you raised me.

149
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,860
You're the one who should think roughly and move quickly.

150
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:45,760
But some feelings get clearer as time passes, no?

151
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,230
For example?

152
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,260
Like longing.

153
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,860
- You're such a smooth speaker. 
 - That's how I made a living.

154
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,700
Gosh, I thought I was the one giving advice today.

155
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,760
You're such a tiresome supervisor.

156
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,360
Why do you always have to teach me something and I always learn something from you?

157
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,030
- What? 
 - I'm leaving.

158
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,830
Bye.

159
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,470
Kids these days...

160
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,380
 Recharge.

161
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,170
 Why can't you even cross the street?

162
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,580
Noona!

163
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,110
Are you crazy?

164
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,100
Why are you holding my hand?

165
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,800
Wait up!

166
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,320
You're all healed. Gosh, your strength.

167
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,070
So what? Do you mind?

168
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,080
No, I'm happy.

169
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,230
Look! I'm wearing the sneakers you bought me.

170
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,010
What do you think?

171
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,630
Today's fashion color is blue and gray.

172
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,180
That's cute.

173
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,800
Wow, that was mean.

174
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,830
Why are you saying like you don't care?

175
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,620
These are really precious to me.

176
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,200
Treat them preciously.

177
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,800
Look!  Can't you just feel the refreshing vibe?

178
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,540
Yes, so refreshing. It must be summer for you. Aren't you cold?

179
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,530
Since we're talking about it, can I have your cardigan?

180
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,700
What?

181
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,080
Never mind.

182
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,020
Your cardigan and my OOTD don't really go together.

183
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,470
See?

184
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,020
I'm really sensitive with colors.

185
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,740
If I became a personal colorist, I would've been great.

186
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,480
It's still not too late.

187
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,740
Should I register you at an academy?

188
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,970
It's fine. I was just joking.

189
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,480
I have a real dream now.

190
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,710
A real dream?

191
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,090
What is it?

192
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,480
I'm not telling.

193
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,370
Not until it becomes true.

194
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,880
Hey!

195
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,260
I think it'll be too small for you. Do you really want it?

196
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,870
- Don't take it off. 
 - Fine.

197
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,660
- Yes. 
 - What?

198
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,820
- Take it off. 
 - Forget it!

199
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,950
Feel my arm. It's so cold.

200
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,970
So cold!

201
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,190
This is why you catch colds!

202
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,690
- I don't catch colds. 
 - Sure, whatever.

203
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,970
I'm really healthy. That's how I make it through.

204
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,400
So embarrassing!

205
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,450
It really feels like a miracle to me.

206
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,520
Every morning I wake up,

207
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,500
I have to think if it's a dream or real.

208
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,530
It's real, Aunt.

209
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,820
Noona, you drank all the herbal tonic I brought you, right?

210
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,700
It's because of that.

211
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,190
- Is it? 
 - It's not.

212
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,610
It's not?

213
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,760
Then... is it because of Aunt's home-cooked meals?

214
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,050
Is it?

215
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,360
That does sound pretty convincing.

216
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,830
Then, what is it?

217
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,720
What can it be?

218
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,060
Love.

219
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,000
Love?

220
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,290
You're right. It's all thanks to

221
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,390
my burning love towards you.

222
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,480
After experiencing this,

223
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,430
I learned so much.

224
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,430
So I'm moving back to Korea.

225
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,730
- What? 
 - So suddenly?

226
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,490
It's not sudden. I've been planning this.

227
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,950
Kevin is wrapping everything up.

228
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,380
I just can't go back

229
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,610
leaving you guys behind.

230
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,890
Is Uncle okay with that?

231
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:02,230
Kevin is really for it.

232
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,250
Kevin thinks family is the most important.

233
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,320
He's really excited to live with you guys.

234
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,670
Awesome.

235
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,240
Then do I get to eat your food every day, now?

236
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,910
Yes.

237
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,960
Make me work. That's why I live.

238
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,360
I also have something to tell you.

239
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,500
I'm going to work.

240
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,100
- What? Already? 
 - Huh?

241
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,670
You can't.

242
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,590
Right, Noona. Why so soon?

243
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,410
I want to work.

244
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,210
The doctor said it was okay.

245
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:39,130
Did anyone tell you to earn money?

246
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,860
Just rest a little more. It's okay if you do.

247
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,310
Yes, Noona.

248
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,690
Or should I give you some money?

249
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,160
I was going to give you anyway, so play a little more with that.

250
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,660
I'm sick of playing.

251
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,580
Not.

252
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,870
Actually, I'm not sick of it at all.

253
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,500
It's just...

254
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,310
I want to play while working.

255
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,250
I guess I'm not the jobless type.

256
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,930
No way.

257
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,350
Your character is your life.

258
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:12,010
- Stillâ€” 
 - I'm really okay.

259
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:16,250
I can't live like a sick person forever. I'm so healthy.

260
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,080
I eat well.

261
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,460
That's true.

262
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,260
She twisted my wrist earlier,

263
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,140
and she's just as strong as Hercules.

264
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,180
Why did you do something to have her twist your wrist?

265
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,370
Giving her a hard time!

266
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,910
Aunt, seriously?

267
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,760
When she twists my wrist, I'm the one suffering. Not her!

268
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,970
Be quiet.

269
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,820
Eat.

270
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,190
Give me some more zucchini.

271
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,370
When do you start working?

272
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,490
I mean the wallpaper on her phone is still a picture with him.

273
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,080
They definitely didn't break up.

274
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,930
So what happened?

275
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,370
How would I know?

276
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,790
She doesn't talk.

277
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,880
Other than that he went to the States,

278
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,310
she didn't say anything else.

279
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,420
It's fine.

280
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,070
There must be a reason she's not telling.

281
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,790
Exactly!

282
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,950
So what's that reason?

283
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,100
You should ask.

284
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,480
I'm too scared to ask.

285
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,100
I'm scared, too.

286
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,030
It's fine.

287
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,790
She just got better.

288
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,350
Let's not get on her nerves.

289
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,670
Stress is the cause of all illnesses.

290
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,330
That's right.

291
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,690
 Your order has been shipped.

292
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,650
 Your order has been delivered.

293
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,030
Why did I get so much stuff?

294
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,230
Still,  how can a person not call someone for so long?

295
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,230
No way.

296
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,950
No way.

297
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,630
It can't be.

298
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,330
It can't be.

299
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,310
You look like you came out saying "no way."

300
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,460
Am I right?

301
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:03,490
Someone told me that I need courage, not time.

302
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,150
I'm not sure if she's right.

303
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,740
But I wanted to count on that saying.

304
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,970
That's why I came.

305
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,830
That was Tak Dong Kyeong.

306
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,000
Why do you say that?

307
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,680
Did you hear the same thing?

308
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,220
Yes, but I couldn't draw the courage.

309
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,980
It's not that you couldn't draw the courage. I beat you to it.

310
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,460
- I didn't call youâ€” 
 - Sign the contract with me.

311
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,300
You're the one who canceled it.

312
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,440
Now what contract?

313
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,630
Let's start with working together.

314
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,270
I can't live not seeing you.

315
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,950
I see it's uncomfortable.

316
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,750
It's all my fault that things turned out this way.

317
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,360
But I'm not planning to regret it.

318
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,200
I'll be the bad guy.

319
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,710
So swing with it, to me.

320
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,590
You're not a bad guy.

321
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:12,120
You can't even pass by a crying person.

322
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,100
That's why you should sign with me.

323
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,870
Since I'm nice.

324
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,460
No, I don't think I can write romances anymore.

325
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,820
- Why not? 
 - I don't think it's my thing.

326
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,090
I'm not enough for a romance?

327
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,610
- That's not what I mean. 
 - It's not?

328
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,570
Of course not.

329
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,900
No matter how much I think about it,

330
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,480
I don't think I'm talented for romance stuff.

331
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,010
You saw.

332
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,770
A writer should create.

333
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,630
I just write about what happened.

334
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,230
So what you're doing with me is romance?

335
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:52,440
- Sorry? 
 - If it is, let's go out for a drink.

336
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,870
- Just like that? 
  - So you make mistakes again.

337
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:58,080
I will take it anytime.

338
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,010
So make mistakes with me.

339
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,110
It wasn't a mistake.

340
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,760
I didn't make a mistake.

341
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:19,350
That wasn't a mistake.

342
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,080
That was my heart.

343
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,240
â™«  Always love  â™«

344
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,700
You're good at romance.

345
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,950
My heart fluttered just now.

346
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,330
I'm not signing because of that.

347
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,800
I'm not asking for you to sign.

348
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,640
If you didn't get it, then forget it.

349
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,400
This is it for today. I'll come back again.

350
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,100
Again? Again when?

351
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,030
About when you might want to sign?

352
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,020
Or...

353
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,250
about when you want to kiss?

354
00:21:54,250 --> 00:22:00,920
â™«  You're the only one I need  â™«

355
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,830
Aunt.

356
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,190
Aren't you going to work?

357
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,660
Why aren't you answering?

358
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,520
You're going to be jobless forever at this rate.

359
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,690
What's up?

360
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,460
Being jobless is that sad?

361
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,470
Is this a dream?

362
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,800
Did you have a dream?

363
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,340
I didn't go to your dream.

364
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,600
I missed you...

365
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,050
I missed you so, so much.

366
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,400
If you miss me, you can just look at me.

367
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,850
Look as much as you want.

368
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:56,010
How do you miss me so much just because you haven't seen me for one night?

369
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,770
What are you always marking?

370
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,530
It's just...

371
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,670
- a good day. 
 - A good day?

372
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,700
Of course, every day is a good day.

373
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,570
Are you going to eat before heading out?

374
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:12,750
You said you're going to see your ex co-workers today.

375
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:16,480
 How long has it been, Manager Tak!

376
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,740
The first news you're telling me after not seeing each other for a long time is that you're going to work at CEO Cha's.

377
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,270
It just happened that way.

378
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm a team leader now!

379
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,480
I'm going to steal all of your top writers, so you better be nervous.

380
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,320
Why would we be nervous? Take them all, all.

381
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,730
CEO Park will go bankrupt, not me.

382
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,550
There are so many publishing companies I can work at.

383
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,590
Does your company need any more employees?

384
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,670
We're just starting.

385
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,690
After we get settled in, we will recruit more people.

386
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:47,020
Then I call dibs.

387
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:50,110
- I call second dibs. 
 - Then I...

388
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:52,210
will remain here.

389
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:56,760
I will remain here and aim for a higher position...

390
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,790
This kid is like this. He's always looking for any opportunities to move up.

391
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,380
He must want to go up so he can order us around.

392
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,690
Wow, the company is going around great.

393
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,390
It's hard to see a young man with so much ambition nowadays.

394
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,610
Isn't he a talented employee that CEO Park would like?

395
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,430
CEO Park is lucky.

396
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:15,860
Now that you mention it, CEO Park is so funny nowadays.

397
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,450
Why? Did something happen?

398
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:25,670
 So you're saying Manager Jo is now in charge of me, right?

399
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:28,080
 Not Manager, but Team Leader.

400
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,280
 This can't do, CEO Park.

401
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:34,140
 I told you... That to a writer, his writing is like his own child.

402
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,620
 My child is very shy!

403
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,680
 Oh, I see...

404
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:46,090
 Seriously, Hyungnim! Our Team Leader Jo does her job very well so treat her nicely!

405
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,640
 I can only treat her nicely if she were actually pretty!

406
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,510
 Hey, Hyungnim, seriously!

407
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:53,340
 This ugly guy loves pretty things.

408
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,930
 I'm sure you're called Ji Jo King because you have Ji Jo (principle)!

409
00:26:56,930 --> 00:27:00,050
 CEO, what did you say when you held onto me after I said I was quitting?

410
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:03,500
 I only stayed because you promised things like this wouldn't happen.

411
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,330
 Things like this? What is this?

412
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:10,940
 Did you already forget about what happened with Manager Tak?

413
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,310
 After going through all that, how did you not learn anything?

414
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,210
 I feel so sick of you. I quit!

415
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:19,430
 Hey, Team Leader Jo! Don't be like that and sit for now.

416
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,750
 Why are you groveling like that?

417
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,480
 Just let her leave! Is she the only person who will work?

418
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,700
 Hyungnim, seriously be quiet for a second!

419
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,090
 Hey! Did you just scream at me?

420
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:33,520
 Team Leader Jo, don't be like that and sit first. Hey, why aren't you bringing coffee?

421
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,570
 Hey? Did you go all the way to Blue Mountain to grind the coffee beans?

422
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,580
 I'm already pissed off nowadays because my rankings dropped,

423
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:42,450
 and now these people as a pair are acting like this!

424
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:56,620
 Writer! Do you really not know why your writing is dropping in the ranking?

425
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,900
 When you work like this, who would speak to you honestly?

426
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,730
 What bullsh*t are you saying?

427
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,480
 The standards of the readers nowadays are so low

428
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,400
 that they don't understand my advanced writing.

429
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,280
 So that's why Shanghai Park or incompetent kids' writings are highly ranked.

430
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:16,080
 Hyungnim, Shanghai Park is nowadays... Hey, why aren't you leaving?

431
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,010
 What are you looking at?

432
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,820
 Are you looking at me?

433
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:24,370
 Wow, I'm about to go crazy seriously.

434
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,810
 Nowadays, even the newbies treat me so rudely!

435
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,070
 No way.

436
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:32,460
 I'm not trying to be rude, but you were talking about me.

437
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:38,520
 Shanghai Park or whatever, that's me.

438
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,790
 What?

439
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:42,920
 Do you want me to explain? Why I'm highly ranked?

440
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,200
 Or why readers nowadays don't read your writing?

441
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,440
What? You were Shanghai Park?

442
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,210
Seriously, you never know when something is right under your nose.

443
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:55,500
I guess there are no editors out there who haven't tried writing before.

444
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,600
I was so surprised.

445
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:03,810
After that, CEO Park is always on the lookout whenever he sees Da In.

446
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,800
What? Why is this kid like this?

447
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,310
I know, right? Why are you like this?

448
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:16,270
Why did nobody tell me?

449
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,560
- What? 
 - Team Leader, Shanghai Park.

450
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,630
The thing is...

451
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,210
Didn't I tell you? I became a team leader.

452
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:25,270
Manager... Even if you became the team leader,

453
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:27,910
shouldn't you have told me at least?

454
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,940
- You? 
 - So, the thing is dearâ€“

455
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,820
Dear?

456
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,390
Since everyone all confessed one thing, I will reveal a secret at this timing.

457
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:40,050
I'm dating her.

458
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:43,080
What?

459
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,760
Did you know, Team Leader?

460
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,440
What? That Da In is Shanghai Park?

461
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,280
No, that Da In and Jeong Min are dating!

462
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,290
What?

463
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:56,610
I seriously didn't even dream of that. Kids nowadays are scary.

464
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:59,830
Anyway, I will tell you the details when I get there.

465
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,220
Get where?

466
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,820
Your office.

467
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,750
Send me your address. I will go there now.

468
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:07,860
-  Hey, hey, wait a momentâ€“ 
  - I'm hanging up.

469
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,850
 Let's get married.

470
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,510
How much are the flowers sitting outside?

471
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,230
What is this?

472
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:42,280
Is this an office?

473
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,480
I thought you got an office so I stopped by, but it's just two desks?

474
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,580
It's very simple, right?

475
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,650
I like simple things nowadays.

476
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:55,320
I don't have a flower vase in the office. What should I do?

477
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,520
What do you mean what should I do? I didn't buy this to give it to you!

478
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,250
Why would the employee buy the CEO flowers?

479
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,780
Then, did someone gift it to you?

480
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,390
Of course, yeah?

481
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:10,060
I bought them with the feeling of being gifted.

482
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,880
You're even buying flowers. Your life must be so easy.

483
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,610
Are you being sarcastic right now?

484
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:17,260
No, relief.

485
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:20,850
I'm glad that your life is going well now.

486
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:23,130
Don't change the topic!

487
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:27,950
I came here because you said I can be the team leader, but what is this?

488
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:32,160
You are a team leader. Team Leader Tak.

489
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,770
There are no team members!

490
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:37,380
You are the team leader, and

491
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,280
team member.

492
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:45,290
Team Leader Tak, don't you know how start-ups are nowadays? Why are you like this?

493
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,830
What do you mean Da In and Jeong In are dating?

494
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:50,450
Oh, right!  It's epic. Do you know Da In's last name is Kim, right?

495
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:54,630
But I was trying to figure out why her pen name is Shanghai Park, but it's because of Park Jeong Min.

496
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,880
She used Park Jeong Min's last name.

497
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,510
I saw them almost breaking up and getting back together live.

498
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,140
Epic.

499
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,290
Are writers all like this?

500
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:07,770
Why do they use the name of the person they like as their pen name?

501
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:11,810
- Did you meet Ji Na Unnie? 
 - What?

502
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,260
Oh yeah, I did.

503
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:19,170
But she said she won't write any romance. It doesn't suit her, apparently.

504
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,160
So you're giving up on romance?

505
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,070
The writer said it doesn't suit her, so what can I do?

506
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:29,460
But looking at how she acts, I don't think it doesn't fully suit her either.

507
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,750
So you didn't give up romance.

508
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:35,340
I usually push the writer towards the direction they want to go to.

509
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:40,020
I wasn't talking about that, but the romance between you two.

510
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,770
Oh.

511
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:48,010
At this rate, you're going to be fighting and making up then going to Bali like someone.

512
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,050
Bali?

513
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,120
I prefer Hawaii more than Bali.

514
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,860
That's not what I'm trying to say right now!

515
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,510
Are you the type to go crazy when you date?

516
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,810
I didn't know, but that seems to be the case.

517
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:05,100
That's enough. Can you give me the contract? I'll get her signature.

518
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,920
I already gave her the contract.

519
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,820
But you didn't get it signed?

520
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,080
It's not that I couldn't get it, but I delayed it.

521
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:16,020
- What? Is this push and pull? 
 - Yeah.

522
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:20,410
But I'm not pushing, but pulling.

523
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:22,920
Is what he said.

524
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:25,420
I think I got caught by the wrong person.

525
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:29,790
I think that, too. How can you deal with a guy like that?

526
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:33,450
How did you end up liking a guy like that?

527
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:35,880
- Liking him. 
 - You don't?

528
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:40,860
- No, I do. 
 - Na Ji Na, who finally admits her feelings.

529
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,260
You fully grew up.

530
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,360
I don't know what to do.

531
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:51,570
Unnie, if the ending happened, you have to write a new novel.

532
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,330
How do you know what the new ending is going to be?

533
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,760
I don't know. You have to write first.

534
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,250
How about if I quit in the middle?

535
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:02,120
It's fine, you can write again.

536
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,510
There is an end that doesn't end.

537
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,900
Sometimes, that is talked about forever.

538
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,570
You know about Kwi Gong Ja, right?

539
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:14,070
After he stopped writing new episodes, he got even more readers.

540
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:18,660
Because of that hiatus, he became a legend that will be remembered forever.

541
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:22,420
So just do it. Just try first.

542
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:25,870
I am a person who will cheer you on forever.

543
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:31,550
You... What happened with him?

544
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,060
That doctor.

545
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,300
I'm waiting.

546
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,280
Waiting?

547
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:45,720
He went somewhere very far away,

548
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,940
so I can't follow him.

549
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,950
He won't like me following him either.

550
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:54,920
So until I can see him again, I will wait happily while being healthy.

551
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,310
If I don't do that, he might scold me when we meet again.

552
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:04,750
He wants me to be endlessly happy.

553
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:11,790
Tak, the weather today is really nice. Should we go for a drive?

554
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,500
Should weâ€“

555
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,790
Or not! You didn't finish writing everything!

556
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:18,870
Can I just not write?

557
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:22,180
Write, quickly. Write, then sign the contract.

558
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,710
I'm waiting for that right now.

559
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,740
This is robbery.

560
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,750
Is this a threat?

561
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,750
Unnie.

562
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:42,020
Your feelings that day when you said you will do everything for me.

563
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:47,230
Did you forget all that already?

564
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,700
I already did it. Take it.

565
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,590
Thank you, Unnie!

566
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,430
Then write the next episode quickly.

567
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:04,910
Tak! You should write.

568
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,710
What do you mean "write"?

569
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:09,360
You said there are no editors who haven't tried writing before.

570
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,220
You said you write after editing manuscripts and thinking, "Even I can write this."

571
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:17,310
But I didn't know the person who would accomplish that would be Kim Da In.

572
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,340
You were good at writing when we were in school. You should write, too.

573
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,400
You should write so you can endure this pain with me.

574
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,740
I can't tell if the writing is the subject, or the pain is the subject.

575
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:29,710
Oh, I get that pain is the object.

576
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,810
It's fine. I have nothing to write about anyway.

577
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:34,650
What do you mean? Just write as if you're writing a diary.

578
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,110
In the beginning, you all start with your own story.

579
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,570
So like you?

580
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:43,350
So what happened to our unnie now?

581
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:45,100
Fine.

582
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,000
I dug my own grave.

583
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:54,790
What is that flower? Who gave it to you?

584
00:36:56,370 --> 00:37:01,250
I just decided to pretend somebody else gifted it to me.

585
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,910
It's pretty.

586
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:09,200
Yeah, it is pretty.

587
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,530
What should I do now?

588
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,400
If you're done with work, get ready to go home.

589
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,440
No.

590
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,970
From now on.

591
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:30,660
My sister became healthy and I really have nothing to wish for.

592
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:35,260
But after experiencing something so big once, you have many thoughts.

593
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,590
Like what?

594
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:43,750
Like what should I do from now on, what kind of person should I become? Things like that.

595
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,690
Do you want me to stop having those thoughts?

596
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:51,440
Do you want to be in charge of the second store?

597
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,370
What?

598
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:57,250
You said you like working. I saw that you are good at this job.

599
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:00,490
I will pay you well. How does that sound? Do you want to try?

600
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:02,570
Do you need time to think?

601
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,970
What do you mean time to think! Of course, I accept!

602
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:07,280
No, I should thank you!

603
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,820
Boss.

604
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,190
Yeah?

605
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:22,780
I have something to confess to you beforehand. Sit down first.

606
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:26,010
Confess? What confession?

607
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:29,100
As long as it's not a love confession, I'm okay with anything.

608
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,280
It's something like that.

609
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,850
What?

610
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,800
I actually...

611
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:40,680
know Na Ji Na. Your first love.

612
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,090
What? How do you know her?

613
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:49,450
She's close with my sister, so I've known her for ten years, and now I treat her like my eldest sister.

614
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:52,160
Or eldest brother.

615
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,150
I didn't know from the beginning, but found out in the middle,

616
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:01,680
but I couldn't find a good timing to tell you until now. I'm sorry.

617
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,630
You don't have to be sorry.

618
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:07,890
I'm not saying this as an excuse, but after I found out that you are that bastardâ€“

619
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:14,470
Or that guy, I sincerely wanted things to work out well between you two.

620
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:17,230
You are a really good person.

621
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:21,740
- Thanks. 
 - Seriously!

622
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:24,890
Whenever you would stare blankly recently, my heart ached for you.

623
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:26,960
I was like that?

624
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,530
I should've worked harder to set you guys up.

625
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:33,710
It's fine. What's the point of that now?

626
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:37,270
I just think that.

627
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:41,490
Even if someone helped, it wouldn't have done anything anyway.

628
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:44,230
Since it's because of what I did, not somebody else.

629
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:47,020
Boss,

630
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,830
you seem like an adult.

631
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:53,210
Hey, I'm older than you.

632
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:56,740
But you're okay now, right?

633
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,620
Of course. I'm always okay.

634
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:03,670
I won't be stuck in the past and run towards the future...

635
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:07,830
It's fine with Joo Ik Hyungnim, right?

636
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,080
Huh?

637
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:16,460
I was just wondering if you only missed out on love.

638
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,740
Oh, I'm sorry. I went over the line.

639
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,630
Do you want to play a game?

640
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,980
You win.

641
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,890
I know, that's a first.

642
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,980
You said you wanted my car, right?

643
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:42,850
No, just pretend that bet doesn't exist.

644
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:48,080
Let's start from the beginning.

645
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,830
Okay.

646
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,810
And from next time, don't go easy on me.

647
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,980
How's your new house?

648
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,180
It's fine.

649
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:14,400
Do you not need anything?

650
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,590
Hyung.

651
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:19,520
I'm sorry but I can't give you that.

652
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,550
Hyung.

653
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,460
Let's play from time to time. Baseball.

654
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:37,110
Not too often, but also drink from time to time.

655
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,410
Won't that be impossible?

656
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:44,660
I like your response this time.

657
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,010
Since it seems like you're not going easy on me.

658
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:55,270
But I hope we can later.

659
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:58,910
â™«  On a day with a starry night sky  â™«

660
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:06,040
â™«  Of all places, you are there again  â™«

661
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:13,210
â™«  I want to do everything with you  â™«

662
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:21,110
â™«  I wish time would go slower when I'm with you  â™«

663
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:29,180
â™«  At the end of the day, I felt sadness for the first time  â™«

664
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:37,990
â™«  Even my heart fell asleep while waiting  â™«

665
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:45,160
â™«  In the distant future, you and I...  â™«

666
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:53,160
â™«  The seasons we'll be living facing each other  â™«

667
00:44:53,160 --> 00:45:00,030
â™«  Among the things that scatter and pile up  â™«

668
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:09,520
â™«  We will bloom and fall asleep in those things  â™«

669
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:16,120
Hey, are you living well?

670
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:25,050
I... just live every day the same.

671
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:28,570
The flowers you bought me withered,

672
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:33,440
and I got so sad while looking at them

673
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,550
so I bought a new one while thinking you bought it for me.

674
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:39,540
It's pretty, right?

675
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:46,850
When this flower withers, I will pretend you bought it for me

676
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:51,400
and keep buying new ones.

677
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,400
I will live like that.

678
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,570
I can do that, right?

679
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:10,290
â™«  Only you  â™«

680
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:30,910
 Doom at Your Service.

681
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:34,050
 Hi.

682
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:37,050
 Who are you?

683
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,080
 Doom.

684
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:57,160
 In the middle of this stopped world, only Doom and I were moving.

685
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:00,030
 Doom, who was standing across the street,

686
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:03,640
 walked lightly towards me as if he was on a walk.

687
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:07,600
 As if I was possessed, I stared at Doom.

688
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,990
 Doom held out his hands to me, who was on the ground.

689
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:13,540
 Choose.

690
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:18,870
 Choose. Will you die here? Or will you hold my hand?

691
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:22,480
 I stared into Doom's eyes, unmoving.

692
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,970
 His deep and parched pupils.

693
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:31,760
 Is this hand your answer to my old question?

694
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,980
 With a shaking hand, I grabbed Doom's hand.

695
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,390
 As if he was satisfied, Doom smiled while looking at me.

696
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:49,550
 Like that, I grabbed onto Doom's hand.

697
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:11,560
Let's eat.

698
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:15,170
How could you not tell me anything in advance?

699
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:17,970
That person who is the CEO... his eyes are this big,

700
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:20,980
and he's pale, with huge ears.

701
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:23,000
I was so scared.

702
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,910
I thought he was there to suck my blood.

703
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:30,230
He will really suck your blood.

704
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:31,920
- What? 
 - Really.

705
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,230
Really, he sucks blood.

706
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:36,740
I don't want to sign the contract.

707
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,380
How can I sign after hearing that?

708
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:41,890
No, if you don't sign the contract, he will really suck your blood.

709
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:45,960
That person doesn't bite a person who is on his side.

710
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,540
But you have to make sure my identity is kept a secret.

711
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,960
Of course.

712
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,480
Do you want me to order you another menu?

713
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,550
It's fine. I'm on a diet.

714
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:05,920
You're on a diet... yet eating spicy rice cake?

715
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,960
What? Do you have a problem?

716
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,730
No!

717
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:14,110
I was so worried about how someone could live while only eating spicy rice cakes.

718
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:18,800
My heart was hurting... that's what I meant.

719
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,930
Oh, right! I saw.

720
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:26,370
You know the predicament that you mentioned earlier.

721
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:29,580
The world will fall into doom if you choose the person you love,

722
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:33,390
and if you want to protect the world, the person you love will die.

723
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:37,830
One day at my house... Whatever!

724
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:42,760
Anyway, you know that Doom? That's a story you talked about, right?

725
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:45,080
Noona, are you close with the writer?

726
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,750
What? Why do you ask?

727
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:51,070
The predicament is set up for a sad ending.

728
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:53,530
I wish it were a happy ending.

729
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:56,510
Can you just ask if it's a sad or happy ending?

730
00:49:56,510 --> 00:50:00,010
I have a lot of tears, so I can't watch a sad ending.

731
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:03,230
If it's a sad ending, I'm not even going to start.

732
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,540
Are you not close? Then never mind.

733
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,400
 Live.

734
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,950
 While living, you will come to realize.

735
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,990
 That you had to experience everything for this exact moment.

736
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:42,260
 That's how it leads to a happy ending.

737
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:48,530
 I still don't know what kind of ending is awaiting me.

738
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:53,140
 I just stand, while still feeling like I'm holding your hand

739
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:57,020
 or being embraced by you.

740
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:01,620
 The world is still full of things that are disappearing.

741
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:05,220
 It is still full of you.

742
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,810
Aunt, where are you?

743
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:15,250
Should we all eat together?

744
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:20,090
How did you even know a place like this?

745
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:23,370
I know, right? The atmosphere is nice.

746
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:27,200
The bag that Dong Kyeong bought me, I brought it out for the first time today!

747
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,600
Ta-da!

748
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,800
Me too, me too! The shoes that Noona bought me. Number eight.

749
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,990
I didn't bring mine since it's a pen.

750
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:37,510
But I will treat everyone today.

751
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:40,540
No! Something good happened to me today, so I want to treat everyone.

752
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:42,830
Good thing? What is it?

753
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:47,670
It's too early to tell you now, but once it becomes more defined,

754
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:50,010
I will tell you guys. So just wait a little bit.

755
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:53,260
But Aunt is the adult here, so it should be my treat.

756
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:58,790
It's fine everyone. It's my anniversary, so it's my treat.

757
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:00,510
What are you commemorating?

758
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:02,010
Not being sick?

759
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:04,050
Finding a job?

760
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:09,540
Nope. To commemorate spending a fulfilling day happily.

761
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:12,400
To commemorate the fact that the sunlight was beautiful today.

762
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,320
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

763
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:18,050
Well, it's true that the weather was really great today.

764
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:21,650
Same. I worked so hard during my part-time job today.

765
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:23,880
The laundry was drying so crisply.

766
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,970
Putting me in a good mood.

767
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:37,680
If Brother could also come, it would've been great.

768
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,650
I know, right! I miss that guy.

769
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,720
Is he doing well?

770
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,430
Do you want me to book you a plane ticket?

771
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:50,930
Fly with this unnie. I got a score of 900 on TOEIC.

772
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:53,370
Is it enough that he's just an American?

773
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:55,010
I will relay it to him.

774
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:57,370
That everyone misses him.

775
00:52:57,370 --> 00:53:00,150
Are you going to video call him? When? Let me join!

776
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:01,740
Hey, butt out!

777
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:04,140
As soon as you see him, you're going to be all over him, saying "Brother! Brother!"

778
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,120
Let me join. I will scold himâ€“

779
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:09,660
Be quiet! Just eat.

780
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,270
Eat, eat.

781
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:14,180
Eat.

782
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:14,200
 Can you smile, even if you don't want to take it?

783
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,570
 It's not that I don't want to take it.

784
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:19,270
 Why are you taking it?

785
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:22,410
 - Huh? 
 - So you can look at it later?

786
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:27,100
So I can look at it later.

787
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:55,270

788
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:04,920
 Today, we all ate together and everyone said they miss you.

789
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:32,070

790
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:35,700
 Today, you appeared in my dream.

791
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,850
 You appeared in my dream again today.

792
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,840
 I miss you.

793
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:47,180
 It's just that I never used it, but after using it for a bit, I figured out the system.

794
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:52,820
 I thought really hard about what to send you as my first text.

795
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:56,420
 You're happy, right?

796
00:55:57,450 --> 00:55:59,480
 I believe that you are.

797
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:05,290
You're not good at it...

798
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:08,930
You weren't able to send it...

799
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,020
â™«  Here with me  â™«

800
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:24,880
â™«  When your eyes brush past me  â™«

801
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:31,760
â™«  I stand alone again at that same spot  â™«

802
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,260
â™«  Here with me  â™«

803
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:43,980
â™«  Even today, I still believe  â™«

804
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:52,760
â™«  Now it's all for you  â™«

805
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:58,620
â™«  While standing in the deep place of my memories  â™«

806
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:04,180
â™«  I hear a low sound   â™«

807
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,620
I'll be back.

808
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:12,790
â™«  It's you who held onto me  â™«

809
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:19,310
â™«  I wanna be with you  â™«

810
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,970
â™«  At the end of a tiring day  â™«

811
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:28,000
â™«  Without a sound, come to me  â™«

812
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,910
â™«  And hug me  â™«

813
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:38,530
â™«  Wait for me at the end of this road  â™«

814
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:44,010
â™«  My feelings for you are unstoppable  â™«

815
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:48,000
â™«  I wanna be with you  â™«

816
00:58:58,090 --> 00:59:00,070
Hello.

817
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,300
Have you been well?

818
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:07,880
Have you been doing well?

819
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,630
You weren't at the hospital.

820
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:11,830
I got surgery.

821
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:13,870
Surgery?

822
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:22,680
Can you feel it?

823
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:27,030
It's beating well, right?

824
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:30,270
It's very warm. A human's heart.

825
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,960
It's very strong and keeps beating.

826
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:38,040
Thanks to you, this will be my longest life.

827
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,660
It's a relief.

828
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:48,210
Thank you. For staying alive.

829
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:52,580
That's something I should be saying.

830
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:54,940
You beat me to it.

831
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,330
I saw that you're doing well, so I should leave.

832
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:03,600
I'll see you later!

833
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:20,750
Use this. It's raining.

834
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,140
How about you?

835
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:23,530
Me?

836
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:28,410
It won't take me long if I just run.

837
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:01,460
You're so pretty and growing so well.

838
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:12,910
You came?

839
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:15,400
Are you seriously saying "you came"?

840
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:24,140
Is she doing well?

841
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:28,530
She is doing well, and also not doing well.

842
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:35,500
Don't be sad. Today is a happy day.

843
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:46,130
It grew well. You became a kind child.

844
01:01:57,910 --> 01:02:01,040
You really bloomed a pretty flower.

845
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:03,190
What does that mean?

846
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:05,350
You are a butterfly.

847
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:08,110
A butterfly for the flowers in my garden.

848
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:13,090
Do you think the butterfly knew?

849
01:02:13,090 --> 01:02:17,270
That when it dies, it will just become a flower.

850
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:23,900
No, even if you didn't know, you chose that.

851
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:26,900
For your single flower.

852
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:32,470
This flower bloomed after a dead butterfly fertilized it.

853
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:38,180
It's a flower that you bloomed.

854
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,300
It's you.

855
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,680
Now you're not a butterfly.

856
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:47,630
You're a flower that I created for the first time.

857
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,250
This is me?

858
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:00,500
Yeah.

859
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,300
So...

860
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:05,340
My real destiny...

861
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:08,310
Is to live happily in this garden.

862
01:03:10,110 --> 01:03:14,290
Not as a butterfly, but as a flower. As a human.

863
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,900
This was planned by you from the beginning?

864
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:19,140
From the beginning, you knew everythingâ€“

865
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:21,670
I didn't know, but...

866
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:24,070
I always believed in you guys.

867
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:26,490
I'm sorry.

868
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:28,970
But I believed in you and hoped.

869
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,090
So go.

870
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:41,100
All your resentment and regret towards me, do that later.

871
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,220
That child is waiting.

872
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:46,500
I don't resent you.

873
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:49,520
I am just...

874
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,230
happy.

875
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,310
Again,

876
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:10,270
since I can see you again.

877
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:12,700
Okay.

878
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:18,370
I always wanted to see you smile like that.

879
01:04:18,370 --> 01:04:20,630
It's enough now that I've seen it.

880
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:22,470
Since I saw it.

881
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:27,520
Now let's say our goodbyes here.

882
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,130
Don't stop, and go.

883
01:04:30,130 --> 01:04:33,090
Go there and love without stopping.

884
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:35,390
Live happily like that.

885
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,370
If I leave, you are alone again.

886
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:41,200
No.

887
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,310
I'm never alone.

888
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:46,700
I'm always with you.

889
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:50,010
I will always be watching over you, watering you, and raising you.

890
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:53,040
Hoping that you're always happy.

891
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:58,860
Later, way later, let's meet again here.

892
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:02,800
Smile.

893
01:05:03,610 --> 01:05:07,040
I am an existence that only wishes for you to smile.

894
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:09,080
Don't forget that.

895
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:20,830
Take this. It's raining outside.

896
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,440
Go quickly. That child is waiting.

897
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,800
Happy birthday.

898
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:58,250
Goodbye.

899
01:05:58,810 --> 01:06:00,560
Sa Ram.

900
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:19,290
 Hello, are you doing well?

901
01:06:19,290 --> 01:06:21,650
 I'm still living, with not much happening.

902
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:24,580
- Thank you! 
 - Come again!

903
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:27,540
- Can I have a roll of kimbap? 
 - Kimbap?

904
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:29,940
 Sometimes, I smile.

905
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:35,090
Writer, about that event, like what I told you last weekâ€“

906
01:06:35,090 --> 01:06:38,000
Hello? H-Hello? He hung up.

907
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,690
Seriously!

908
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:46,860
 Sometimes, I get angry.

909
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:51,030
â™«  When I see you, I think of one person  â™«

910
01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:55,090
â™«  One day, when I first saw you  â™«

911
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:59,060
 Sometimes, I'm bored.

912
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:06,300
â™«  On that beautiful day,  â™«

913
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:09,820
â™«   that one person  â™«

914
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:11,640
 You paid off all of your 13-1 Quarter student loans.

915
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:13,710
 While living like that,

916
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:18,930
  moments that are like gifts arrive from time to time.

917
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:27,050
â™«  Shines clearly with countless stars  â™«

918
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:31,320
â™«  Dream-like love, don't you know it yet?  â™«

919
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:37,170
 Sometimes, it's so difficult to the point that I want to die.

920
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:41,470
 But I live.

921
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:44,340
 Because this is the life that you gave me.

922
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:47,040
 But I walk.

923
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:49,370
 Because that's life.

924
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:57,250
 Where are you?

925
01:07:57,250 --> 01:08:01,260
 Now, where are you passing by?

926
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:08,410
â™«  When I see you, I keep on smiling  â™«

927
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:14,210
 It might be that you're always here.

928
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:17,670
 With a completely different face.

929
01:08:17,670 --> 01:08:20,460
 With a completely different appearance.

930
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:24,410
 As a completely different existence.

931
01:08:24,410 --> 01:08:26,520
 If I think like that,

932
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:30,910
 I keep looking at the faces of every person I meet.

933
01:08:30,910 --> 01:08:36,450
 I peer into the lives of every person I meet.

934
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:39,010
 "Is it you?"

935
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:40,650
 "Is it you?"

936
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:42,490
 While thinking that.

937
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:48,900
â™«  Like the warm spring,   â™«

938
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:52,670
â™«  they bloom into beautiful flowers  â™«

939
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:57,780
â™«  Dream-like love, don't you know it yet?  â™«

940
01:08:57,780 --> 01:09:02,880
â™«  You always change me  â™«

941
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:10,030
â™«  I'm happy you're here  â™«

942
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:18,140
 If I pass you by,

943
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:20,560
 like you always did,

944
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,870
 can you grab my hand?

945
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:26,550
 Even if it's only for a moment.

946
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:29,740
 It's okay if it's even just for a moment.

947
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,340
 Please grab onto it.

948
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:36,070
  Grab onto me.

949
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:17,970
Did you bring an umbrella? It's raining outside.

950
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:21,550
You...

951
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,610
What are you?

952
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:31,870
Your hand-holder.

953
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:46,940

954
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:53,130
â™«  All of my love  â™«

955
01:10:53,130 --> 01:10:58,080
â™«  You're my one and only  â™«

956
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:04,550
â™«  The one who held my hand when I was standing at the end of a cliff  â™«

957
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:10,820
â™«  All of my love  â™«

958
01:11:10,820 --> 01:11:13,190
â™«  All the times that were like miracles  â™«

959
01:11:13,190 --> 01:11:17,200

960
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,370
 I'm not Doom anymore.

961
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:22,540
 I'm just a human like you.

962
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:24,580
 This isn't a dream, right?

963
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:26,580
 Hyungnim!

964
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:29,420
 Are you listening? Are you perhaps... sleeping?

965
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:32,270
 What are you going to do? About being my girlfriend?

966
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:34,350
 What if I choose not to do that?

967
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:36,470
 How does it feel to live?

968
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:38,720
 It's good.

969
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:40,940
 Live eternally with me.

970
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:43,410
 I thought it was the end,

971
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:45,220
 since destiny doesn't change.

972
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:48,800
 Don't disappear. Never.
