1
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,440

2
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,420

3
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,720

4
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,440

5
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,700

6
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:59,160

7
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,920
 This drama is fiction.  All characters, places, institutions, religions, and events that appear are not real.

8
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:14,930

9
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,580
God is on my side.

10
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,130
Choose. Will you die here?

11
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,810
Or will you hold my hand?

12
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,270
The answer to that is...

13
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,070
It's me.

14
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,940
Don't let go.

15
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,110
Don't let go, if you don't want to die right now.

16
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,190

17
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,230
How is this possible?

18
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,670
We just traveled across time. It's nothing.

19
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,410
Not that.

20
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:56,550
Your... How should I word it?

21
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,640
I'm searching for an expression that isn't rude.

22
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,590
- My identity? 
 - Yeah.

23
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,000
Are you just very suspicious, or curious?

24
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,480
I don't have much of either. It's just common sense.

25
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,870
Common sense or whatnot, you just saw it. You experienced it. Accept it.

26
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,940
It's easier said than done.

27
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,160
- You are alive right now. 
 - But what?

28
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,810
It was Switzerland, then Italy outside.

29
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,360
So what?

30
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,510
Your dream, subway station, workplace, do you not remember?

31
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,640
I do remember. But it doesn't make any sense.

32
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,960
No matter how much I think, I think I've gone crazy.

33
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,950
Okay. Look carefully.

34
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,640
At what?

35
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,220
What's wrong with this?

36
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,810
How about this?

37
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,260
  Was there a power outage?

38
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,720
Just a coincidence?

39
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,480
 - What's this? 
 - My phone turned off.

40
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,990
 - It just turned off by itself. 
 - My phone, too.

41
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,000
 Is it out of battery?

42
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,070
Just a coincidence?

43
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,120
Is your identity... related to electricity?

44
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,770
 Look over there! What is that?

45
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,620
  Why are there shooting stars right now?

46
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,560
I got it. I got it, so stop.

47
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,750
Why? I didn't do this.

48
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,490
My identity is related to electricity.

49
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,050
I told you to stop!

50
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,110
Stop!

51
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,850
  The electricity came back!

52
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,430
I'm not nice.

53
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,110
You just made a contract with someone like that.

54
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,450
Keep that in mind. I'm bad.

55
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,320
I need to stop fooling around now and leave.

56
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,390
- So suddenly? 
 - Something just happened that's getting on my nerves.

57
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,820
Just think of that as a show to commemorate our contract.

58
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,870
I hope that it made you happy.

59
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,950
You didn't want to grab onto it earlier, but now you don't want to let go?

60
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,890
You told me to not let go.

61
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,380
What is this?

62
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,020
My promise. Since I told you I won't make it hurt.

63
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:24,040
Don't be too reassured. It's like charging. Once a day, before 12.

64
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,830
Charging? How does it work?

65
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,000
- By holding my hand. 
 - What? Why?

66
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,180
In case you run away.

67
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,620
And think of a wish, Tak Dong Kyeong.

68
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,150
Hey! How do you know my name? Hey!

69
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,770
Excuse me...

70
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:06,070
- Yes? 
 - Earlier, at the crosswalk...

71
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,110
Do you not remember?

72
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,270
I don't know what you're talking about.

73
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,810
It must've really not happened.

74
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,600
You're such a handful.

75
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,720
Should I just kill you?

76
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,420
I told you not to park your car, but you keep doing that.

77
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,450
I told you doom is within my jurisdiction.

78
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,160
Do something to me! I keep hearing voices.

79
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,140
I can't sleep. I'm about to go crazy!

80
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,620
 Die.

81
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,700
  You trash-like bastard. Just die!

82
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,500
  You coward. Just die!

83
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,920
  A bastard like that should just die. Die, you murderer!

84
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,810
  Just die! We should rip you into shreds and kill you!

85
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,740
  Die!

86
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,580
How does it feel to experience it?

87
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,230
It's something I go through every day.

88
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,900
Just kill me! Please!

89
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,950
Out of all the people you stabbed, three people died.

90
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,180
Two of them are still unconscious.

91
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,640
But you are perfectly alive, so you should be thankful to me.

92
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,140
That wasn't my plan...

93
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,030
It wasn't like that...

94
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,020
Does living go according to plan?

95
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,770
I'll stop here for today.

96
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:15,360
I made a good contract today, so I'm in a good mood.

97
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,480
What are you?

98
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,790
Have you heard of this phrase?

99
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:24,210
Between the start and finish, the beginning and the end.

100
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:31,560
The finish. The end. That's what I am.

101
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,910
Hey!

102
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,240
 Why are you doing this to me?

103
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,050
 What do you want?

104
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,940
Doom.

105
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,300
    (2ã…—  for middle fingers after Jo)

106
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,440
What's with the calls?

107
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,040
Unnie, even though you won't believe what I'm about to say,

108
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,230
but, still, listen to me.

109
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,850
Unnie?

110
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,930
Unnie!

111
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,080
Unnie! What's the matter?

112
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,840
What is it? What's wrong?

113
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,380
I'm going to die.

114
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,960
- What? 
 - I'm going to die!

115
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,080
Why?

116
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,860
Unnie, did you...?

117
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,110
It's all gone.

118
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,450
It's what the heavens wanted.

119
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,080
The heavens thought my writing was useless, so it's all gone now.

120
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,890
They should've made this happen before I wrote all of it!

121
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:03,580
What's with this comet? What was that power outage for?!

122
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,430
Well, what else? They just want me dead.

123
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,470
Be well. Goodbye.

124
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,190
Unnie, why would you die?

125
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,940
This is all that bastard's fault!

126
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,540
That bastard?

127
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,980
Who? Bill Gates?

128
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,020
No, no, there's just someone else.

129
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,700
Unnie! Have a seat first.

130
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,420
You're a pro!  Why are you being like this?

131
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,820
You're the one who knows best what to do in a situation like this.

132
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,220
I don't know. Should I just die?

133
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,760
There is just one answer, Writer.

134
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,830
- What is it? 
 -  Write it again in an hour.

135
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,910
What? My will?

136
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,440
- Your writing. 
 - My writing?

137
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,690
I'm going to the rooftop.

138
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,240
If you're going to go, write before you go.

139
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,430
What's the point of writing it, anyway? I don't even get a good response.

140
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:13,260
The company didn't really like this one, either.

141
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,280
What'd they say? Be honest.

142
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,860
  It's not fun.

143
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,750
  This writer doesn't really have a talent for romance.

144
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,290
  The male lead is too ordinary. Her views keep dropping.

145
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:29,890
  But usually when we make users pay to read this, we lose half the subscribers.

146
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,700
  Jeong Min, would you yourself date this man?

147
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,020
  - What? 
 - I wouldn't.

148
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:39,020
  I'll try to give her feedback to make her shorten the first part and finish the story quickly.

149
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,050
  Yeah, just have her finish off this work.

150
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:44,360
  Let's just see what her next one is like.

151
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,490
They said you're worth keeping an eye out for.

152
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:50,060
Don't lie! My views are already half what they should be, anyway.

153
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:55,450
Well, after changing to pay-to-read, usually half the subscribers are lost, anyway.

154
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,160
Yeah, that's true.

155
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,130
So, for now, let's just write. Okay?

156
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,840
If you don't keep up your upload schedule,

157
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,820
you'll lose half of those subscribers.

158
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,490
Come on.

159
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,120
Did you eat, though?

160
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,540

161
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,520
That's not much to eat.

162
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,280
It's really filling, though.

163
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,820
I don't even have enough time to write, so how could I eat?

164
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,460
This is way better than the food I make anyway, in terms of taste and nutrients.

165
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,500

166
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,580
Unnie, you know...

167
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,160
Where do I even start?

168
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,590
What? What'd you say?

169
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,830
I'm going to the convenience store.

170
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,490
All right.

171
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,240
Hello.

172
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,490

173
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,960
Yes, Writer? Are you having any issues?

174
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,350
  Yeah, the issue is with you, Tak Dong Kyeong.

175
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,530
Why are you being scary like that, using my full name?

176
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:37,460
Was something incorrectly uploaded?

177
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,940
  Are you even scared?

178
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,200
  I didn't call you as a writer. I called as a doctor.

179
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,990
  This... This is a threatening call.

180
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,150
Ah. That.

181
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,590
  Even though it might not be much right now, it'll soon hurt so much you'll want to die.

182
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,130
  It's not a threat. This is a fact.

183
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,670
Will it really get worse and worse?

184
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,540
  Are you really asking me this, Editor?

185
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,690
So, will I die after being in immense pain?

186
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:13,230
Or will I die after being in slightly less, but still immense pain?

187
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,910
You're telling me to decide between those, right?

188
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,300
I don't like both of those options.

189
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,020
  Don't think badly. You're thinking badly right now.

190
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,490
I've already had bad thoughts before.

191
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,850
 I won't regret it.

192
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,690

193
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,450
Doom is approaching. Repent and be saved.

194
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,630

195
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,210
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

196
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:02,230
Due to our countless evil deeds, God is angry.

197
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,730
From what others have been saying, today's comet is an omen of doom.

198
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,920
Doom is coming. It's right in front of our noses.

199
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,920

200
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,430
That's true.

201
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,320
God is angry. Doom is coming.

202
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,660
God's angry?

203
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,370
I'm feeling fine today.

204
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:41,000
Then, I guess God will be angry soon.

205
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,230
You told me to be humans' hope.

206
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:50,160
But what humans hope for is doom.

207
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,630
- How interesting. 
 - It really is.

208
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,290
In the past, humans would just ask for winning the lottery,

209
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:59,990
being healthy, or being happy. Things like that.

210
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,740
Do you know? If the garden disappearsâ€“

211
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,670
Then there's no need for a gardener or a butterfly.

212
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,120
Why don't you respond?

213
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,400
Just do as you wish. I'll do as I wish, too.

214
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,460
Let me ask one thing.

215
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,660
Why is it me?

216
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,530
Not sure.

217
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,970
Fate?

218
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,600
How cruel.

219
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,500
Fate is cruel to anyone.

220
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,230
If you do bad things, you'll get punished.

221
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,890
I am already being punished.

222
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,470

223
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,300
  You're not taking my calls?

224
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,900
  You'll regret this.

225
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:47,770
  (T/N: He used incorrect spacing and made a spelling error)

226
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,370
  I told you you'd regret this.

227
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,590

228
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,790
Unnie! I need to go back to work right now.

229
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,590
I'm sorry, I'll treat you to a meal tomorrow.

230
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,710
Tak Dong Kyeong, wake up to your mistakes!

231
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,910
Tak Dong Kyeong, wake up to your mistakes!

232
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:15,470
Manager Tak Dong Kyeong, who works here, is a homewrecker!

233
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,270
I had been living peacefully until she seduced me.

234
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,010
Seduce? That word doesn't fit Tak Dong Kyeong at all.

235
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,690
- My fragile self fell to temptation. 
 - Fragile?

236
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:28,760
I lost my precious wife! Everyone, does this make sense?

237
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,430
Tak Dong Kyeong, wake up to your mistakes! Wake up!

238
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,080
Excuse me. You can't be like this at the workplace. Please leave.

239
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,990
I just feel so wronged, that's why!

240
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,980
- Please leave. 
 - Tak Dong Kyeong, wake up to your mistakes!

241
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,280
Let's talk outside.

242
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,350
Wow, you're so amazing.

243
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,120
You just messed up someone's life. How can food still go down your throat?

244
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,150
- Let's talk outside! 
 - Forget it!

245
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,340
What did you tell my wife?

246
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,990
What did you tell her, for her to want to divorce me?

247
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,470
"I didn't know he was a married man. He fooled me."

248
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:10,370
"I did not do anything wrong. He's the one who did."

249
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,710
That's what I said. Why?

250
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,270
I really can't believe this.

251
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:18,610
Hey, I wasn't in love.

252
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,600
It was just like a fling.

253
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,050
Shouldn't we have ended things in a good manner?

254
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,460
Manner?

255
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,880
- You're talking about manner right now? 
 - Yes, manner! M-a-n-e-r!

256
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,140
M-a-n-n-e-r.

257
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,230
Honestly speaking, there's nothing much to you.

258
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,020
You don't have anything that others have.

259
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,360
Do you have parents? Money? What do you have?

260
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,600
  Think of your wish, Tak Dong Kyeong.

261
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,690
I'll just wish right now, then.

262
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,180
What?

263
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,130
Nothing.

264
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:00,610
It's such a waste to use on someone like you.

265
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,910
Is it now, then?

266
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,320
What's now?

267
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,720
Doom.

268
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,450
What on earth are you talking about?

269
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,190
I want to kill you, that's what I'm saying.

270
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,860
Wow!  This kind of stuff is what makes it obvious that you weren't raised by your parents. Exactly this!

271
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,720
Hey, this is exactly why I'm making sure my kid doesn't grow up without his dad!

272
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,690
Excuse you!

273
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,050
Excuse me. You seem like the higher-up here.

274
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:32,460
It's terrible for the company's image if a person like this works here.

275
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,420
Wait, wait, wait.

276
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,010
Don't open the door for outsiders to come in.

277
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:52,510
Are you guys all okay? I feel like I'm getting sick now after my lunch.

278
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:58,690
Fire the homewrecker, Tak Dong Kyeong! Fire her!

279
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:01,990
I'm this bastard's wife. All of his words are lies.

280
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,730
- I'm so sorry for the inconvenience. 
 - Hold on!

281
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:07,090
- It's a misunderstanding! A misunderstanding!  
 - Come on.

282
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:10,090
Honey, be careful of the baby! The baby!

283
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:13,460
Hey, Tak Dong Kyeong! Wait!

284
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,730
You! Really!

285
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,960
 Close it!

286
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:23,390
Wow, geez.

287
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,640

288
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,390
  No way. You guys won't believe what just happened at the office.

289
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,880
If I hear any typing from this point onwards, you're dead.

290
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,260
Hey!

291
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,100
It's not me.

292
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,210

293
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,740
I'll be resigning.

294
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,050
I'm just the team leader, I don't have that power.

295
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,650
The CEO isn't here right now.

296
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,650
You can make the decision in his stead.

297
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,700
That's a bother.

298
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,570
It's not even time to work yet.

299
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,630
When is the CEO coming?

300
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,260
I don't know.

301
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,630
What?

302
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,960
He went to Bali with his girlfriend to make up.

303
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:32,400
  Park Chang Shin: At Bali to make my queen feel better.

304
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,300
  I'm a man in charge of one company.

305
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:39,720
 However, today, I'm just a man for one woman.

306
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,590
  Kim Cheol Woo: Looking good, sir.

307
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,690
  Cha Joo Ik: Sir, have a relaxing time.

308
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:46,960
  Jo Ye Ji: Sir, please relax for a long time.

309
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,190

310
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,700
Recharge.

311
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:22,090
Why aren't you even crossing the road?

312
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,150
I'm scared.

313
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,230
- If you're scared, you can call for me. 
 - Through what means?

314
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:28,890
- In any way. 
 - You sound like you're on my side.

315
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:32,390
You're mistaken. How was your day today?

316
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,290
Why are you asking that?

317
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:37,830
You never know. You might want to bring doom upon everything today.

318
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,990
That makes things easier.

319
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,040
There's something I'm curious about.

320
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,930
What happens if I break this contract?

321
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:52,630
- If you break it? 
 - Let's say you allow me to not have any pain until I die and my wishes come true.

322
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,960
But I die without wishing for doom.

323
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,840
Will you do that?

324
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,590
Then, someone else will die instead of you.

325
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:14,290
The person you love most at that moment.

326
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,390
What? What are you saying?

327
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,440
The doom is brought from here to here.

328
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,750
It's nothing big.

329
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,200
It's different from what you originally said.

330
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,680
We never talked about this.

331
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,710
No matter the contract, there is always a penalty.

332
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:33,150
It doesn't matter. You already agreed to the contract.

333
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,980
Nothing else to say.

334
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,990
You con artist.

335
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:46,560
If you already knew about it, would things have changed?

336
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,230
I don't think so.

337
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,440
Okay. Here's a fair contract.

338
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,040
I'll let you choose again. What will you do now?

339
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,320
Hurry and choose. You might die.

340
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,940
- Hey! 
 - You win some, you lose some. That's how it goes.

341
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:27,990
Think it through well. Throughout your life, you've won things by losing other aspects.

342
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,300
Why?

343
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,580
Why is it me?

344
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:35,150
Why on earth does it have to be me?!

345
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,860
Fate.

346
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,510
How cruel.

347
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,530
Fate is cruel to anyone.

348
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,480
Stop! Stop it!

349
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:26,200
â™«   It's about to fall off, it's dangerous   â™«

350
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,110
See?

351
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:32,260
â™«  I'm tearing up Yeah  â™«

352
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,960
â™«   The darkness   â™«

353
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,920
You asshole.

354
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,950
â™«   It disappears   â™«

355
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,350
I've heard that so many times.

356
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:44,120
Is it fun to play around with me?

357
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,590
I told you I'm not on your side earlier.

358
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,910
You're the one who chose this.

359
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:52,910
I'll always respect your choice.

360
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,890
â™«  Why can't it stop?  â™«

361
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,480
Do you want to keep standing here?

362
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,010
Then do that. I'm going to cross.

363
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,100
It's a bit boring.

364
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,540
â™«  Falling apart  â™«

365
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:15,880
â™«  Shining in the darkness  â™«

366
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,430
â™«  I'm breaking down  â™«

367
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:24,590
â™«  Living in the consciousness  â™«

368
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:30,600
â™«  Inside my memory, yeah  â™«

369
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,790
 Why?

370
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,690
 Why is it me?

371
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:46,730
 Why, why does it have to be me?

372
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,410
 Why is it me?

373
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,680
 Fate?

374
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,060
  It's so harsh.

375
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:01,810
â™«  Darkness is turning red  â™«

376
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:09,260
â™«   And getting deeper, empty life   â™«

377
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:13,310
â™«  My last favor  â™«

378
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:17,880
â™«   I'm breaking down â™«

379
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,940
Noona! I brought the omegi rice cake that you like.

380
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,720
Look! I bought so many!

381
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,630
 Someone else will die in your stead.

382
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:32,420
 The person you love the most in that moment.

383
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,730
What?

384
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:44,170
I took care of the thing with the insurance.

385
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:46,810
It just so happened that the guy who rented us the car was...

386
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:52,620
My alumni's older brother's aunt's cousin's...

387
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,240
Anyway, I took care of it because it was someone I know.

388
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,220
For real.

389
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,120
Noona, what's wrong?

390
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,780
Noona, have you been drinking?

391
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,960
Did you change your ways from beating me up, Noona?

392
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,610
Noona.

393
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,170
 Excuse us.  We'd like to place an order.

394
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,820
Yes.

395
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,410
That'll be $2.00.

396
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,780
I'm so pissed off.

397
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,910
Anyway, it's important to keep them hanging.

398
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:14,100
It's playing hard to get.

399
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,580
That way, the readers can be like "Next episode, what's going to happen?"

400
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,960
and follow along while salivating because they're so curious.

401
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,790
You understand right, Manager Tak?

402
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,090
Like a skirt's hem.

403
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:26,360
As if you can see, or not.

404
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,670
A skirt's hem?

405
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:35,450
Does Writer Lee Hyeon not come to the office these days?

406
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:36,830
What?

407
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,890
I heard that writer is really pretty.

408
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:45,810
I heard you're close with her. Show me her face!

409
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,720
You know, there's something between writers.

410
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,250
Their eyes can meet, then their heart, then...

411
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,920
You know what I mean, right?

412
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,580
You really don't know your place.

413
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,930
What?

414
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:06,870
This guy. An old man who doesn't know where he stands and makes inappropriate advances to a middle schooler.

415
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:10,630
You did that on purpose, right? Does he die later?

416
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:15,430
That has nothing to do with the social stigma.

417
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:18,600
That setup is to emphasize innocent love.

418
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:24,080
That kind of bastard lies about being a married man and seduces an unmarried woman.

419
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,590
What?

420
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:28,510
Why doesn't social stigma come into play with love?

421
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:31,840
Love that extends beyond social stigma is called a crime.

422
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,980
Oh, is he a criminal?

423
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,220
Manager Tak, why are you speaking like that?

424
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,610
Why?

425
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:41,850
You wrote it so realistically, so I'm being amazed by that right now.

426
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:45,370
Seriously, you used to not be like this.

427
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,610
When a person suddenly changes, she will die.

428
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,320
Is it because I brought up Writer Lee Hyeon?

429
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,600
No! It's because it seems like it's time for him to die.

430
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,790
I was just wondering if it's now.

431
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,680
Where are you going in the middle of a conversation?

432
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,780
I'm going to meet the lovely Writer Lee Hyeon.

433
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,170
Is it because of a man?

434
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:16,400
Man? What man?

435
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,220
I don't have a creature in sight that I can call a man.

436
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,260
Think carefully.

437
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:23,420
He's someone really familiar with water.

438
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,690
That guy is blocking your future.

439
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:32,520
You've been possessed by a water ghost.

440
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,550
You're going to change your pen name after all this time?

441
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:40,590
She told me to get rid of everything that relates to that guy.

442
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,760
Thanks for the meal.

443
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,420
Why did I use that guy's name as a pen name,

444
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,750
and why did he happen to go swimming?

445
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:51,260
That's really shocking though... How did she guess it was related to water?

446
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,760
Unnie, where's that place?

447
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,350
Why? Is something not working out for you?

448
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,790
No, just work.

449
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:03,610
Are you thinking of leaving? There are many other companies besides yours.

450
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:06,530
It's not that I want to leave.

451
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,250
- Tak.  
 - Yeah?

452
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,190
Should I...

453
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,730
quit being a writer?

454
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,190
Unnie!

455
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,390
  I will mix the rice for you.

456
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,960
You can eat it after the cheese melts.

457
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,130
Unnie, if you were to die in a hundred days, what would you want to do?

458
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:54,530
Why? Are you dying?

459
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,830
I was just curious.

460
00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:00,800
First, I would buy a five-layered cake and dig in.

461
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,280
- What else? 
 - Travel.

462
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,620
What else?

463
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:08,840
What else?

464
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,790
I don't know, I haven't really thought about it.

465
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:17,860
I was thinking about it while frying the rice...

466
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:23,420
I'll make sure to see you succeed before I die.

467
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,850
That's why I'm saying this.

468
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:37,080
I know you're going to be shocked, but don't be too shocked.

469
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,810
Let's end the series.

470
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,390
Not right away, but within this month.

471
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:54,990
Let's just think of it as concluding a little early.

472
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,190
This is all because of that guy.

473
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,890
Lee Hyeon Kyu, that water ghost.

474
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:04,910
Also, this isn't something big, but

475
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:07,540
my boyfriend turned out to be...

476
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,480
a married man.

477
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,700
What?! That scumbag.

478
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,600
You saw everything. You all have brains, so you must've gotten a grasp of the situation.

479
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,290
Team Leader, what do you think of this matter?

480
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:25,330
I have no opinions.

481
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,770
Then I will assume you will continue having no opinion.

482
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:30,060
How about you, Jeong Min?

483
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,590
Regardless of what happened, it's true that it's an affair.

484
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,800
She's not that kind of person.

485
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,500
You never know.

486
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,990
That man seemed like he was rich, too.

487
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:40,890
She must like everyone who has money.

488
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:43,040
Then she should've seduced you or the CEO.

489
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,950
What do you mean?

490
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:47,710
Just that you seemed jealous of her meeting a rich guy.

491
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:50,540
That was a good comparison. You can say something like that?

492
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,300
I don't feel so great, all of a sudden.

493
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,930
It seems like we're done making a consensus, so let's head out.

494
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:56,260
It's too late to get off work on time, but I want to at least finish working overtime early.

495
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,920
- I still have things to discusâ€” 
 - Aren't you done?

496
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:01,420
I'm done.

497
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,310
Do you know that the owner of the cafe is the building owner's son?

498
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,200
- Wow... 
 - Whoa!

499
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,370
Welcome! Just a moment.

500
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,320
  So he must live at the penthouse.

501
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,530
 I heard the building owner's son lives there and manages the building.

502
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:18,400
 So the yellow sports car sitting in the underground parking lot must be his.

503
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,980
  I heard it's owned by the building owner's son.

504
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,790
You worked hard!

505
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:30,040
You guys are already came back?

506
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:35,370
- I thought you were quitting. 
 - You told me I couldn't.

507
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:36,830
Why aren't you getting off work?

508
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,370
There are some things I need to finish editing.

509
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:41,280
Why are you working so hard, when you said you're going to quit?

510
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,060
Then, do you want to do this instead?

511
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,280
Good luck.

512
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,700
What did Writer Lee Hyeon say?

513
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:53,360
She agreed. The writer knows the best when the feedback isn't great.

514
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,230
What did you talk about with Writer Ji Jo?

515
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,980
It's not Ji Jo. It's Ji Jo King.

516
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,320
I just can't bring myself to call him by his full name.

517
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,770
I dissed him a bit.

518
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:03,950
Oh, what's the occasion? You couldn't bring yourself to speak harshly before.

519
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,560
Good job.

520
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,000
He wants us to change the person in charge to someone pretty.

521
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,110
Do people edit with their faces? That's ridiculous.

522
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,260
Make Jeong Min do it, he's pretty.

523
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,600
You think I'm pretty?

524
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,160
I'm sorry, I have a weak stomach.

525
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,570
I'm going to do it, because I'm the prettiest.

526
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:24,050
Why did you meet that kind of guy?

527
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:32,310
I was editing at a cafe, but someone almost spilled their coffee while walking by.

528
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:36,000
I was almost done, around 80 episodes worth.

529
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:40,220
But suddenly, someone appeared and blocked that coffee with his body.

530
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,180
- Credit given. 
 - Credit given. 
 - Credit given.

531
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:47,330
I told him I'll pay for dry cleaning, and asked to grab a coffee,

532
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:49,830
like what you witnessed.

533
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:52,190
You worked hard.

534
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:23,380

535
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:28,840

536
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:49,680
  These are the only pages I can fill out.

537
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:59,640
  When I look at dramas or movies, people facing death were able to leave with no regrets.

538
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,630
  Oh, and think of your wish, Tak Dong Kyeong.

539
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:13,250
  I don't have money to leave, dream to accomplish, or unfulfilled love to pursue.

540
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:20,050
  If I can live for ten years, I would want money, a dream, or love.

541
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:23,270
  But I will live for only a hundred days.

542
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:25,960
  Then someone else will die in your place.

543
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,170
 The person you love the most at that moment.

544
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:35,580
  The world that I managed to survive is nothing different from doom in the end.

545
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,190
  You told me to bring doom upon the world.

546
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,520
  I'm so tired...

547
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:50,500
  Is everyone just living like this?

548
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:56,170
  While being tormented by life and death.

549
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:04,400
  Like if I'm neither living nor dying.

550
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:20,880
  - Bring the defibrillator! 
 - Yes!

551
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,620
Patient, are you okay?

552
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:03,130
I don't think I can live past twenty in this life.

553
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,450
What kind of God is always in pain and sad to the point of death?

554
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:11,700
For the world to exist, somebody has to pay the price.

555
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,350
That price to pay is a heart disease this time?

556
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:21,630
It's probably because they ask for God over here the most.

557
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:24,930
Fine, since they are the reason for your existence.

558
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:29,020
The moment a large group of people called for God, I opened my eyes.

559
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:32,750
So I will gladly pay the price.

560
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:35,150
That's the job that God, who was created by humans, must fulfill.

561
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:39,600
And the job that you, who was created by that God, needs to fulfill.

562
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:46,940
You already know that you can't escape your destiny.

563
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:54,820
She's not going to resign herself to the world, like you did.

564
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:58,920
I'm going to make her resign herself to the world.

565
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,480
Really?

566
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,720
Even if that's the case, will it be possible?

567
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,100
Humans made God, so Doom is nothing.

568
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,060
You and I were made from human's will.

569
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:10,820
Then I must do something.

570
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:13,760
Since that's not all there is to humans' will.

571
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:18,040
Leave. Before it turns 12.

572
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,890
God doesn't not know.

573
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,940
I just always pretend not to know.

574
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:49,200
  I will take it now. One, two!

575
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,570
  I will take it one more time.

576
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:57,810
  No, no, just smile widely!

577
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:00,700
- Do you want to die? 
 - What?

578
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,990
Why are you here? Did you want to get slapped?

579
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:09,400
Is that how you apologize normally?

580
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,440
I'm not sorry.

581
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:16,420
Let's fight after we take all the pictures. Smile!

582
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:19,060
Smile, he's telling you to.

583
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:31,160
Can you photoshop my chin even more?

584
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,790
Then this won't be your face.

585
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:35,140
Is that important?

586
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:40,000
Of course! An ID photo is used to check if it's actually you.

587
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,910
This isn't an ID photo.

588
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:47,660
Can you print it that size? With the frame?

589
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:50,720
They usually use black, right?

590
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:55,010
Do you want me to make your eyes bigger?

591
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:56,740
The eyes...

592
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,210
Do you have to do this? You can just take the car comfortably.

593
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:16,900
I don't want to take your car.

594
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,370
You don't know what might happen.

595
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:21,170
Then at least take the bus.

596
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:22,830
Don't talk to me.

597
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:25,390
I just want to walk.

598
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:27,230
You're really wasting time.

599
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:29,870
Shouldn't every second be valuable to you right now?

600
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:37,680
You only look at me when I pick a fight.

601
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,580
Humans are so strange.

602
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,240
Why do they want to leave those things behind?

603
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,260
They can't even see it anyway.

604
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:50,470
It's not for me, it's for others to see.

605
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:53,030
I do that sometimes.

606
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:57,440
Then you decided you want to die, right?

607
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,730
Things like you only care about yourself, right?

608
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:07,880
You don't know to what extent I only care about others.

609
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,750
Even now? Even after getting slapped, I came running to save you.

610
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:22,490
Time is ticking.

611
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:41,020
Get used to it. If you want to walk with me.

612
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,910
Are you doing this?

613
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:50,400
I didn't do it,

614
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,740
but it's because of me.

615
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,490
That too?

616
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:09,330
Sometimes.

617
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,920

618
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:15,590
That's right.

619
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:21,680
How do you live like this?

620
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:25,320
I'm not alive. I'm just existing.

621
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,500
  I'm just a Doom button.

622
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:37,220
 My footstep, my hand gesture, my breath.

623
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:41,240
 My everything leads to doom.

624
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,550
That's the reason for my existence.

625
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:49,420
What if you don't do anything?

626
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:53,160
What if you just don't do anything?

627
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:58,080
  Hell opens.

628
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,230
  Unexplainable abnormal temperatures are continuing.

629
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:04,850
  Even if it's October, heatwave and drought are occurring throughout the nation.

630
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:07,020
  We're going to have crop failure this year.

631
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:10,260
 It seems like the world is going crazy nowadays.

632
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,450
  It's crazy! Why would he kill himself?

633
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:14,780
 He's like a devil. Why won't he die?

634
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:18,130
  If there is a god, he should take away bastards like that first.

635
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:26,240
When you gain something, you lose something.

636
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:31,060
Everything I've accomplished in life, was done by things I've lost.

637
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,500
I get what that means now.

638
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:38,860
There has to be winter for there to be spring,

639
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:42,340
and there has to be darkness for there to be light.

640
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:45,330
There has to be death for there to be birth.

641
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:47,890
It's something like that, right?

642
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:54,700
So you're winter, darkness, and death.

643
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:58,040
Yes.

644
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:02,150
Like what you said, you only care about others.

645
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:06,360
You came to me when I only cared about myself.

646
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,640
But how long do we have to be holding hands?

647
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:21,550
I thought we were just holding them because we liked it.

648
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:46,660
Why did you follow me all the way here? It's burdensome.

649
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:48,950
Anyway, thank you.

650
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:52,500
You can leave now. I'm not going to run away somewhere.

651
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,530
Should we see each other tomorrow?

652
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:57,320
- What? 
 - Should I come and pick you up?

653
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:01,170
You choose.

654
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:03,580
Why are you like this, all of a sudden?

655
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:06,990
I shouldn't care if you're in pain and crawling on the floor.

656
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:09,600
Do you have bipolar disorder or something?

657
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,690
You were doing so well earlier. Seriously.

658
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:14,370
Hey! It was good between us until now.

659
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:18,020
We were understanding each other, and exploring each other's identities.

660
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,770
I'm telling you to cling onto me.

661
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:22,240
What, to you?

662
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,760
To the fate that came to you.

663
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:39,090
Hey, Tak Dong Kyeong!

664
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,320
Tak Dong Kyeong!

665
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,650
W-W-What is this?

666
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:50,120
Nothing is stopping me right now.

667
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:59,100
Oppa must've been crazy, Dong Kyeong.

668
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,180
Oppa didn't mean it all!

669
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:05,140
It wasn't that you were crazy, it's that you are crazy even at this moment.

670
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,000
This guy is crazy!

671
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,530
We loved each other, we did!

672
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:13,300
I didn't mean what I said at the company, about not being sincere!

673
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,880
This is my sincerity! Drunken truth!

674
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:20,680
Yes, Drunken Truth! I sang that for you many times, do you remember?

675
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:24,270
Wow. Let go of me!

676
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:27,290
If you are drunk, you should go back home. Why would you come here?

677
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:33,400
â™ª You're right, I may be drunk â™ª

678
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:37,910
â™ª This may be a mistake  â™ª

679
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:41,590
â™ª  When the morning comes â™ª

680
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:49,740
â™ª I will confess to you now, I loved you from the beginning â™ª

681
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,100
Let go!

682
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,340
Seriously, let go!

683
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:56,170
Get lost from my life!

684
00:53:56,170 --> 00:54:01,200
â™ª Even if my sloppy declaration seems corny â™ª

685
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,960
Let go!

686
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,120
â™ª and unbelievable â™ª 
 - Seriously, let go!

687
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,230
What are you?

688
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:10,960
Let go.

689
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,560
Let go of me, you bastard!

690
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,240
Is this your wish?

691
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,960
- What? 
 - Making this disappear from your life.

692
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,590
Are you crazy? Why would I waste my wish on a guy like this?

693
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,900
Let go of this!

694
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:25,580
Should I take care of him like this?

695
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,940
Honey...

696
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,010
Honey...?

697
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:34,910
 (Boyfriend.)

698
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:37,150
Honey? Tak Dong Kyeong, who is this bastard?

699
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:41,470
This is the bastard you are sick and tired of, right?

700
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:44,310
Let me take care of this, so go inside and eat, Dear.

701
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:47,070
I made some cold cucumber soup that you like.

702
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:49,550
Dear?

703
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:52,200
Cold cucumber soup?

704
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,340
Tak Dong Kyeong, you had a man?

705
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:57,950
You were living the good life with him?

706
00:54:57,950 --> 00:54:59,840
This is better.

707
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:03,120
We can equate me lying about being a married man and you were living with some guy,

708
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,480
then we can start our relationship again. Right?

709
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,530
What is all this?

710
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:14,400
What is this?

711
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,530
Hey, hey, hey, hey! It's not what you think! Hey!

712
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:21,580
Which guy is the married man, and which one is the one you're living with?

713
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:24,350
First, let me beat up the married man first.

714
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,500
Wait a moment. W-Who are you?

715
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:27,730
- Hey! 
 - Hey!

716
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:29,460
- Why are you like this? 
 - Hey!

717
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,300
Come here!

718
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,120
Seriously, so funny.

719
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:20,710
It's unbelievable.

720
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:26,180
It's fine, I'll do it.

721
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:28,530
Thanks for helping meâ€”

722
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,670
I said I won't make it hurt.

723
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:51,410
I can see why you think of me.

724
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:56,830
I was wondering what human would make that kind of wish at that moment.

725
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:00,860
Why is that me thinking of you?

726
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:03,280
Since I am Doom.

727
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:07,350
You were the only person who was thinking the same thoughts as me at the same time.

728
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:16,770
I am thankful, for many reasons.

729
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:29,700

730
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,090
Hey...

731
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,970
This can't do.

732
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:51,160
Let's live together.

733
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,830
Us.

734
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:05,700
â™«  Itâ€™s about to fall off, it's dangerous  â™«

735
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:12,780
â™«  Iâ€™m sorry I'm tearing up Yeah  â™«

736
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:20,910
â™«  The darkness falls down and disappears  â™«

737
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:25,660
â™«  In the frozen time  â™«

738
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:31,530
â™«   They will disappear without a trace  â™«

739
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:37,060
â™«   Why can't it stop?   â™«

740
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:42,120
â™«   My last favor â™«

741
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:45,630
â™«   I'm breaking down â™«

742
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:50,770
â™«  Falling apart  â™«

743
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:56,140
â™«  Shining in the darkness  â™«

744
00:58:56,140 --> 00:59:00,130
â™«   I'm breaking down â™«

745
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:04,010

746
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:06,400
  Why would you say let's live together?

747
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,600
  Embarrassment will last only for a moment.

748
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:10,500
  - Hello, Brother-in-Law! 
 - Hey!

749
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:11,770
  What is this bottle of alcohol?

750
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:12,970
  What is this sofa?

751
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:14,730
  Where can I sleep?

752
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:18,900
  It's him, right? The person you love the most.

753
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:22,500
  Can't you change her fate?

754
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,000
  Your hand.

755
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,310
  I'm not a human.

756
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:28,270
  I can't feel sympathy or love. I don't have those emotions.

757
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:30,870
  I do. Since I'm a human.

758
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:34,930
 So become the first human to ever love me.
