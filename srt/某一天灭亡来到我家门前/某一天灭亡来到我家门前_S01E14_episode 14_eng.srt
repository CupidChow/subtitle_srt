1
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,610

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,680

3
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,130

4
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:33,740

5
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,870

6
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:48,140

7
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:59,160

8
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,230

9
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,810
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,060
Out of the two, what are you sorry for?

11
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,690
The choice of erasing your memory or for falling for my looks again?

12
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:35,140
All of them. I'm sorry for everything.

13
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:42,290
♫  I still with you, I'm still here  ♫

14
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,320
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,720
For being handsome in the midst of everything.

16
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:56,920
♫  I still with you, again today, like this  ♫

17
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,980
When I thought back, it was all things like that.

18
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:10,960
I think everything was going back towards you.

19
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,250
I wanted to bear everything.

20
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:19,170
I thought I could run away,

21
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,320
but it ended up like this.

22
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,720
What do we do?

23
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,620
What do we do now?

24
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,550
Now we know.

25
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,580
That we can't run away no matter what.

26
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,250
So now...

27
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,190
let's acknowledge.

28
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,590
Acknowledge what?

29
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,510
Our destiny.

30
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,620
Let's accept it.

31
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,950
Hmm?

32
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,990
You're thinking that.

33
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:14,590
You are thinking of disappearing for me.

34
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:23,090
You won't change your mind no matter what I say.

35
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,280
And no matter what method,

36
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,730
we can't get out of this destiny. Right?

37
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:42,160
♫  You, don't forget  ♫

38
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,560
Right.

39
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,960
♫  Just once is enough. Leave it as a memory  ♫

40
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,930
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,790
Why are you sorry? Sorry for what?

42
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,840
It's all my fault. If I hadn't wished for that then...

43
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,660
Then we wouldn't have been able to meet.

44
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,020
There wouldn't be.

45
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:11,120
Then I would still be nothing.

46
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,840
I don't want to be nothing to you.

47
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,490
Once is enough to experience that.

48
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,760
So you didn't do anything wrong.

49
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,690
The wrong is always mine.

50
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,990
So you should just concede it to me, got it?

51
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,370
♫  You, I'll tell you now  ♫

52
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,330
♫  Love you, love you  ♫

53
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:51,140
♫  I only need you  ♫

54
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,920
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,660
It's all my fault.

56
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,200
♫  Because it's only you  ♫

57
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:18,990

58
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,900
Do you know how much I looked for you?

59
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,860
What did you want to get from home?

60
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,740
Me.

61
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,020
Mr. Doctor?

62
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,330
Aunt, do you remember him?

63
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:45,530
Look at you. Of course, I remember.

64
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:49,490
What are you saying? Are you saying I'm at that age already?

65
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,230
No, that's not what I meant—

66
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:55,570
I was worried that you might've forgotten me since it's been so long.

67
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,760
That must be why she's asking.

68
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,860
Come to think of it,

69
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,400
I haven't seen you these days.

70
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,400
What kept you from coming over?

71
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,700
I've been organizing my things.

72
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,090
Organizing?

73
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,000
There are a lot of things to prepare to get married.

74
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,480
We're getting...

75
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,030
married.

76
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,230
What?

77
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,140
Marriage?

78
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,070
Let's close up early today.

79
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:37,030
Already? It's not closing time yet.

80
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:44,870
Boss, the promise with customers is the most important in a private business.

81
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,230
- Boss, is something wrong? 
 - Do I look like something is wrong?

82
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:52,590
Very much. Your eyes look like they'll pour rain.

83
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,290
You look like you're walking in a rainstorm by yourself.

84
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:00,160
Rain... I heard it rained that day.

85
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,500
That day?

86
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,560
When? It didn't rain yesterday.

87
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,600
That day... The day she kissed some other guy than me.

88
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,910
Pardon? Who? Noo—

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,530
I mean that lady from yesterday?

90
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,930
But it doesn't matter.

91
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:28,100
It's been so long and that's not a problem.

92
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,570
That's not a problem? It's true love.

93
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:35,300
Yeah, that's not a problem.

94
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,800
The real problem is...

95
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,230
I got dumped yesterday.

96
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,430
Stay down. Lay down. I'll do everything.

97
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,230
Rest.

98
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,830
Na Ji Na, that...

99
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,130
Welcome.

100
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,930
Hyungnim.

101
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,310
Come back home.

102
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,030
 They know each other.

103
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,600
 They even live together yet never told me.

104
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,340
 Isn't this totally playing me?

105
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,960
#2...

106
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,490
Noonim.

107
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,910
You scared me. You're back early. Did you get done early?

108
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,550
- Noonim. 
 - What?

109
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,460
Did you dump my boss?

110
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,800
Fast news.

111
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,030
Did you really dump him?

112
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,250
- I didn't really— 
 - Who did you kiss?

113
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,070
How do you know that?

114
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,350
How long has it been and he's already talking?

115
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,220
How long has it been?

116
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,450
Which one are you talking about?

117
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,890
I heard it's been really long.

118
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,540
What?

119
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,360
Did you do it recently?

120
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,770
Do you just kiss all the time?

121
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,570
What is your charm?

122
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,720
Who did you do it with? When did you do it?

123
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,680
You did it with #2, right? I'm right! You did it with #2.

124
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,950
Noona, Ji Na Noonim recently with a guy—

125
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,080
Don't listen to him.

126
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,480
They are getting married.

127
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,820
Well, it's not like we're doing it...

128
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,270
It happened to be like this.

129
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,250
No.

130
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,320
It's true.

131
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,490
I think it's true.

132
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,620
- We need to talk. 
 - We need to talk.

133
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,560
Wait...

134
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,930
Is that why I haven't been able to see you lately?

135
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,290
Rather than not being able to see, it was more like you didn't know me.

136
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,420
Of course, I didn't know you were thinking that far.

137
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,660
Brother, you're really a big person.

138
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,950
There's no way I can be like you.

139
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,220
Honestly, it's not an easy decision.

140
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,830
I don't feel all comfortable.

141
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:38,880
I've been carrying this for the moment like this.

142
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,620
I've been saving up ever since I was 20 years old, doing part-time.

143
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,300
Why are you giving that to me?

144
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,530
I've been carrying this all the time wondering

145
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,150
when and how I should give it to my sister.

146
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,690
I think this is the right time.

147
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,630
You should use it for the marriage.

148
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:01,050

149
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:09,120
To be honest, I thought you were a jerk in the beginning.

150
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,860
You look handsome and rich, and I wondered why you liked my sister.

151
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,360
You had no idea I was thinking all this, right?

152
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,670
Yes, I had no idea.

153
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:27,120
But now I wonder how lucky my sister is.

154
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,210
Is it because she's been so nice?

155
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,830
You must've been really nice to have met a person like my sister.

156
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,720
Please stay by...

157
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,440
my sister, Brother.

158
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,450
You will do that, right?

159
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,750
Yes.

160
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,630
Marriage? You're getting married?

161
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,830
I think that's what he wants to do.

162
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,370
How about you?

163
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,750
That's not what you want?

164
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:51,180
I want to do everything that he wants to do.

165
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:57,170
Hey, marriage is not something you do out of loyalty.

166
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,350
No matter how much you love him—

167
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,030
Unnie.

168
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,910
Hey.

169
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,680
No matter what you do, I will check everything before you get married.

170
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,750
What do I do?

171
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,140
Are you crying?

172
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,520
No matter how much I try to end it,

173
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,790
no matter how much I try to run away, I end up at the same place.

174
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,910
I try to abandon, but I can't.

175
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:34,080
I try to forget, but I can't. What do I do?

176
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,520
I don't have time, but I also don't have any other ways.

177
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,640
What do I do?

178
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,820
Dong Kyeong.

179
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,870
It's all my fault.

180
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,590
It's just all my fault.

181
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,980
No, it's not your fault.

182
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,480
You didn't do anything wrong.

183
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,030
So do everything that you want to do.

184
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,540
I don't care what.

185
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,680
Forget everything I said earlier.

186
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,970
If you're happy now, that's all that matters to me.

187
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:15,640
So don't say that you don't have time.

188
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,590
Don't say such things.

189
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:36,930
What do I do?

190
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,880
Unnie...

191
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,000
Leave them. I'll do it.

192
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,220
Being here, now I get it.

193
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,620
Get what?

194
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,480
That you've been waiting for me like this.

195
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,830
I wondered what you did sitting here, not going in your room.

196
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:38,070
You always waited for me to finish everything.

197
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,050
It's nothing like that.

198
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,950
You can stop looking after me.

199
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,500
You can stop waiting for me.

200
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,140
You raised me well.

201
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,360
- Lee Hyeon Kyu. 
 - I want to stop bothering you now.

202
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,690
I really need to grow up.

203
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:20,090
If you keep taking my back,

204
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:22,540
I keep wanting to lean on you.

205
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,080
See? I'm blaming you again.

206
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,100
Are you saying you're moving out?

207
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,500
Yes.

208
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,210
I'm going into the world.

209
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,590
When do I get all these?

210
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,450
Still...

211
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,810
I should go now.

212
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,260
So...

213
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,730
- Doctor. 
 - I heard.

214
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,960
You're getting married.

215
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,210
When did you hear that?

216
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,920
There are so many ears in this hospital.

217
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,950
Congratulations.

218
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,690
Sure.

219
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,310
That's why I'm saying this.

220
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,890
So...

221
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,330
You...

222
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,630
don't want to do the biopsy?

223
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,160
You said it's in a dangerous spot.

224
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,090
Then let's do this.

225
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,260
Just until your wedding. Let's just postpone it till then.

226
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,640
Okay.

227
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,210
To be honest, you're right.

228
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,290
It's very dangerous.

229
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:38,960
We might open up then just close it without being able to do anything.

230
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,400
That's why I wanted to proceed with the treatment with just the biopsy and not a surgery.

231
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,260
But...

232
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,840
to live a little longer,

233
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,650
to live a little longer

234
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,570
and to be a little happier,

235
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,820
we decided on this treatment.

236
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,750
Right.

237
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,160
But you'll have to rush the wedding.

238
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,320
If there's something wrong, come to the hospital immediately. You can promise that, right?

239
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,430
Thank you.

240
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,180
Don't be too scared, though.

241
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,970
You're doing great right now.

242
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,980
I'll make sure to attend your wedding.

243
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,060
When are you planning to do it?

244
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,610
Well, I'm not sure yet.

245
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,500
My sister is going to be discharged.

246
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,350
What does your aunt say?

247
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,100
She's worried.

248
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,260
Tell her to not worry.

249
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,700
I'll take all the responsibility.

250
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,370
I'll take her and bring her back.

251
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,100
So tell her to not worry

252
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,250
and let's do everything that Dong Kyeong wants to do.

253
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,140
What's going on?

254
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,920
I thought you'd be furious and oppose everything.

255
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,190
She was bawling.

256
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,250
She pretends to be okay but she's probably not okay.

257
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,230
She must be anxious about everything.

258
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,800
I don't even want to think about it.

259
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,170
But just so there are no regrets.

260
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,790
Let's do everything.

261
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,800
Okay.

262
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,790

263
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,490

264
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,190
Yes.

265
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,900
 Let's meet.

266
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,110
Okay. Where?

267
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,850
Okay.

268
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,200
I got to go.

269
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,020
Noonim.

270
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,430
Yeah?

271
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,040
Do well so you don't regret anything.

272
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,010
Worry about yourself!

273
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,040
Bye.

274
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,030
Is it marriage blues?

275
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:04,040
Does marrying me make you that anxious?

276
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,480
I'm upset.

277
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,080
You used to tell me how handsome I was and all.

278
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,470
You should be thankful to get married to me.

279
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:31,990
Do you know how easy it is to marry a guy you thought was so handsome at first sight?

280
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,080
Now you don't even answer me?

281
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,670
But you won't be able to resist answering after seeing this.

282
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:50,630
Seon Kyeong gave this. He said to use it for our wedding.

283
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,010
It was worth raising him.

284
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,140
Why are you looking at me like that?

285
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,210
Am I that handsome?

286
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,950
It's been so long since I came here.

287
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:41,220
It seemed so big back then.

288
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,000
We've grown that much.

289
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,550
Remember I told you someone I know is sick?

290
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,500
Yes.

291
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,750
It's glioblastoma.

292
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,820
She could die.

293
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,700
I never thought...

294
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:11,180
that would happen to her.

295
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,190
I never thought...

296
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,670
she might disappear from my side.

297
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:25,140
So how stupid am I?

298
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:33,720
Then yesterday she told me she wanted to get married, while bawling.

299
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,890
That made me think.

300
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:40,240
Think of what?

301
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,610
What would I do if this was my last day?

302
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:51,420
Would I be in love like her?

303
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:11,580
When I first saw you, you were really cute.

304
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:17,210
When our eyes met in the hallway, your eyes looking at me

305
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,600
said everything you wanted to say.

306
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,240
I could read all that and I loved it.

307
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,330
Your eyes were so honest.

308
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:30,010
But you know what?

309
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:32,590
You're still like that.

310
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:37,280
Your eyes are still so honest. Unlike mine.

311
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:43,710
That day of the SAT, I got sick from eating rice cake and was rushed to the hospital.

312
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,460
And this is what I thought.

313
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,540
"This is nice."

314
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:55,270
I pridefully said "Let's go to college together. Let's get in a college in Seoul."

315
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:59,710
But you know, I wasn't really good enough to do that.

316
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:03,120
But I didn't want to tell you that.

317
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,760
I was too embarrassed. I liked you too much.

318
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,590
I always wanted to be cool in front of you.

319
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,570
I rashly went abroad and avoided your calls.

320
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:20,920
And just uploaded nice pictures on social media.

321
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:25,060
I actually cried all the time before going to bed.

322
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:31,160
I couldn't communicate, there was no one I knew.

323
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,850
I was behind in training. Everything was a mess.

324
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:38,570
I wanted to come home every day.

325
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,950
I missed you all the time.

326
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:43,830
But...

327
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:48,580
I felt like I might cry if I heard your voice.

328
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,400
And I thought you'd notice that.

329
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,600
That's why I avoided you.

330
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:02,380
Then I returned after doing all that.

331
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:09,710
Returning after all that was so embarrassing,

332
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:12,530
so I couldn't contact you.

333
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,410
Why not?

334
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,820
It was better to be the bad guy to you.

335
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,270
I didn't want to be the pathetic guy.

336
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:23,020
But that's really pathetic.

337
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:27,390
I was so childish.

338
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,920
I was not grown up.

339
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,430
I'm sorry.

340
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,910
You should have told me.

341
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:44,390
You should have told me.

342
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:56,790
This field still looks big to me.

343
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:00,240
I must've not grown at all.

344
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,120
Hyeon Kyu.

345
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:08,800
Since I asked to meet you, we still have one more date.

346
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,990
That one date, let's meet when you really want to meet me.

347
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:16,890
When you really miss me. Don't force yourself to see me.

348
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:19,640
I won't beg.

349
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,570
For the last time,

350
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,330
a handshake to commemorate our graduation.

351
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:34,020
♫   little smiles  ♫

352
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:40,090
♫  Keep making me blush  ♫

353
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:44,980
♫  This is love  ♫

354
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:49,690
♫  Oh love  ♫

355
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:58,180
♫  I will stay here  ♫

356
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:14,830
♫  I dream, it gets even clearer when I close my eyes  ♫

357
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:19,050
♫  This is love  ♫

358
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:30,920
♫  In your eyes  ♫

359
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:39,960
♫  I wonder what kind of person I am, it makes me anxious  ♫

360
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:45,120
♫  Throughout my day, anywhere  ♫

361
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:51,090
♫  My head is filled with you  ♫

362
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:56,290
♫  It's hard to handle for me, so it makes me sad  ♫

363
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,390
Goodbye.

364
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:06,920
♫  This is love, oh love  ♫

365
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:15,340
♫  I will stay here  ♫

366
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:31,540
♫  I dream, it gets even clearer when I close my eyes  ♫

367
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:35,960
♫  This is love  ♫

368
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:53,020
♫  Now you have become a beautiful memory to me  ♫

369
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:59,860
♫  Always love, love, love  ♫

370
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,560
I didn't give up.

371
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,750
I'm not running away.

372
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,710
I know.

373
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:10,530
Just make one mistake.

374
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:13,400
I'll run over and get her.

375
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,830
Be alert.

376
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:22,070
Always be alert.

377
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,830
I'll do that.

378
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:13,730
 She finally felt like she was done going through 18, 19, and 20,

379
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:18,420
 and finally felt like she was here at the present.

380
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,660
 And no matter when that may have been,

381
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:26,270
 it would've ended like this anyway.

382
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:37,490
 "Ending like this" was another name for destiny.

383
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:42,260
 I was also headed to an ending like that.

384
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,170
Hi.

385
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:48,620
You must be getting discharged.

386
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,120
Did I scare you?

387
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,830
I didn't mean to.

388
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,050
Your face looks worse.

389
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,220
I wanted to help. Sorry.

390
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:19,370
Help me. Help me one more time.

391
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:22,320
It's out of my hands now.

392
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,350
Then, what should I do?

393
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,490
What should we do?

394
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:31,550
Accept it.

395
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:38,260
I don't want to.

396
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,960
If you don't want to,

397
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,150
are you going to bring doom upon the world?

398
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,000
I will.

399
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,070
You can't do that.

400
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:51,260
You're not a person who can do something like that.

401
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,230
No.

402
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:57,740
For him, I can do anything.

403
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,610
My life has disappeared countless times.

404
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,920
I know the most about how things disappear.

405
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:15,470
You can cry and try as hard as you can.

406
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:19,000
Then, in the end, you come to accept it.

407
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,590
Because that is that child's choice.

408
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:28,010
That choice is fate.

409
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,660
So just accept it.

410
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,690
Accept doom.

411
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:42,430
That is not something you can do anything about.

412
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,540
I'm sorry.

413
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:50,510
But that is the ending that the child wants.

414
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:54,910
That is the happy ending that the child wishes for.

415
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:59,910
How is that a happy ending if none of us are happy between the two of us?

416
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:03,010
While living, you will come to realize.

417
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:06,190
That you had to experience everything for this exact moment.

418
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,300
That's how it leads to a happy ending.

419
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,990
You have to live to know.

420
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:14,720
If everyone dies, you cannot know that.

421
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,420
So just live.

422
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:29,480
That child wants you to live.

423
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:34,970
He wants you to live very happily.

424
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,160
You sold a lot today.

425
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,760
Go back inside now.

426
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,040
I am your last customer.

427
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,010
You're leaving everything behind?

428
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,420
Now I don't need it anymore.

429
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,850
I have to leave behind everything.

430
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,820
It's heavy.

431
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:47,840
While living, everything was so heavy.

432
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,450
Now, I should let everything go and leave.

433
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:58,110
Goodbye. You worked hard all this time.

434
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,410
Hi.

435
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:54,990
If you came, you should've come in earlier. What kind of joke are you playing?

436
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,300
Let's get married.

437
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:07,710
You smiled. I'm going to interpret that positively.

438
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,200
The flowers are pretty.

439
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,770
♫  When I see you, there's something I have to say  ♫

440
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:27,400
You just said that so I can leave the hospital.

441
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,850
Why are you actually giving me flowers?

442
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:32,810
Who said that I just said it for no reason?

443
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,770
Then you actually bought this?

444
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,660
To propose to me?

445
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,980
No. Somebody gave it to me.

446
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,990
Who gave it to you?

447
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:47,010
A person whose last day was today.

448
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:52,820
She gave it to me for the last time while leaving.

449
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,990
The person who is disappearing,

450
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:59,080
to someone who will disappear.

451
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,930
I should put them in a vase.

452
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:08,420
So I can see it for a bit longer.

453
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,450
- Let's stay together. 
 - Okay.

454
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,840
Let's not be separated.

455
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,020
Okay.

456
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,370
Forever.

457
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,790
Okay.

458
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:45,910
♫  I miss you even more today  ♫

459
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:53,950
♫  When I see you, I keep on smiling  ♫

460
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:57,500
Why?

461
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,470
That was not the last time.

462
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:05,630
I realized that I might be able to see flowers again.

463
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,880
On this tree?

464
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,400
Yeah.

465
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,790
Let's come back to see them.

466
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,980
Together.

467
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:23,820
No matter what, let's come back to see them.

468
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,420
♫  When I see you, the feelings in my frozen heart  ♫

469
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:33,540
♫  Like the warm spring   ♫

470
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:37,390
♫  They bloom into beautiful flowers  ♫

471
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:42,510
♫  Dream-like love, don't you know it yet?  ♫

472
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:47,620
♫  You always change me  ♫

473
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:52,840
♫  I'm happy you're here  ♫

474
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:59,200
♫  Always stay with me in the same time  ♫

475
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:05,340
♫  Without hurting, until I can protect you  ♫

476
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:12,610
♫  You are my only love sent by Heaven  ♫

477
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:18,390
 Like this, days like this will continue.

478
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:20,910
 After you leave, spring will arrive.

479
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:24,190
 When you fall, morning will rise.

480
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:28,690
 When you end, I will start.

481
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:36,070
♫  Dream-like love, don't you know how I feel?  ♫

482
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:41,140
♫  You always change me  ♫

483
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:48,260
♫  I'm happy you're here  ♫

484
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:05,980
♫  I miss you even more today  ♫

485
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:46,810
 So always, whenever it's spring,

486
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:49,060
 or the morning,

487
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:54,240
 during all my life, I will think about you.

488
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:57,980
 Can I endure that?

489
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:04,880
 That life... won't be any different from doom.

490
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,700
A pen?

491
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,790
She must be crazy.

492
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:40,570
 To my most sane writer,

493
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:42,800
 and my craziest Unni.

494
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,650
Craziest?

495
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:56,580
 I'm telling you this first. I'm not writing this so you cry, so don't.

496
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:59,620
 This is water-based ink.

497
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:03,570
 So don't cry, become strong.

498
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:06,710
 That is your goal. Na Ji Na.

499
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:12,920

500
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:26,980
 Noona can't receive this money, Seon Kyeong.

501
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:30,540
 This isn't even half of the money you got from me as allowance.

502
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:33,180
 How dare you to try to equate it with something like this?

503
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,000
 You really have no conscience.

504
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,010
 But I'm thankful for you always.

505
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:42,100
 I'm always proud of you, my younger brother. For growing up so well.

506
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:52,860
 Aunt, in my life,

507
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:55,730
 there was so much love.

508
00:45:55,730 --> 00:46:00,980
 Now that I think about it, what saved me was love.

509
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:06,580
 Your love, Seon Kyeong's, and Unni Ji Na's.

510
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:10,030
 And... that person as well.

511
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:13,700
 So I'm afraid.

512
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:17,210
 Since I don't want to lose anything.

513
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:25,490
I...

514
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,700
Will I be in a lot of pain when I die?

515
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:32,380
I asked you that before, right?

516
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:34,870
Mom...

517
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,100
Dad...

518
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:43,450
I'm so afraid.

519
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:47,510
What kind of choice I will make...

520
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:51,920
I don't really know. But...

521
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:57,970
no matter what I decide,

522
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:00,640
I think it will hurt a lot.

523
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:04,810
I'm so afraid of that.

524
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:10,780
I'm so afraid.

525
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:30,610

526
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,290
How did you come here?

527
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:41,150
I followed you.

528
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:43,780
How long were you following me for?

529
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,410
From the moment you were born.

530
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:48,000
Why are you following me?

531
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,760
Because I like you.

532
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,630
Because it'll be wasteful, otherwise.

533
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:55,770
Because I don't want to miss a single moment.

534
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,590
Let's go together.

535
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:01,230
Where?

536
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:06,550
To work.

537
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:23,710
Why here? Is this library going to disappear?

538
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:26,840
No.

539
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,920
The words are going to disappear.

540
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:34,170
I can hear it.

541
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:36,260
Even in that corner over there,

542
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:39,280
hundreds of words are disappearing every second.

543
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,900
Flattering, new girl,

544
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:46,780
epiphora, Cassiopeia, latent star.

545
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,650
Words are forgotten as well.

546
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:50,940
If they are not used,

547
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:53,020
they will end up dying.

548
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:14,350
This is a secret, but...

549
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:17,300
there are words that will never disappear.

550
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,110
Around twelve.

551
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:22,630
In there, your name is included.

552
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,380
Dong Kyeong (deep longing).

553
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:28,910
How about Sa Ram (person)?

554
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:31,430
That's included as well.

555
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:48,880
It's so annoying.

556
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,690
Why?

557
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:53,590
I don't want to sleep, but I'm tired.

558
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:58,860
Sleep. You're a person, so you need to sleep.

559
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:07,730
I will sleep for just a moment. Seriously, just a moment.

560
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:09,150
Okay.

561
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,060
Don't go anywhere.

562
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,530
Okay.

563
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:22,070
Stay right next to me.

564
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:23,460
Okay.

565
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:27,620
Don't disappear.

566
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:13,850
Is this the last day?

567
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,030
I came here to say goodbye.

568
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:20,570
I'm the one who came to say goodbye.

569
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,750
You knew, right?

570
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,630
That I will make this kind of decision.

571
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:37,870
God... knows everything.

572
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:40,280
No matter what, nothing is set in stone.

573
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,390
Even if she wished for doom,

574
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:45,420
I cannot know if that is possible or not.

575
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,360
So how about if you just

576
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,940
place your bet on that?

577
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:54,000
No, I am going to place my bet on something I know for sure.

578
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,320
The method that will surely save her.

579
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,480
Why did you make that kind of pointless promise?

580
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,350
I must've had to keep that promise.

581
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:05,820
- Keep what? 
 - Whether it's the promise,

582
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:09,410
or her, or this world.

583
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:17,730
You have more things to protect than me.

584
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,280
I plan on living a bit longer.

585
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,410
While depending on the heart of a human,

586
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:37,110
I want to continue on this life for a little bit longer.

587
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:42,400
Isn't this... your first time?

588
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,520
That you're thinking of that?

589
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,920
Yeah.

590
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:51,040
Someday, that heart will stop again.

591
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:56,620
But there are many things I want to see in this body.

592
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:01,420
I really like this life. For many reasons.

593
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,860
What do you want to see?

594
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,330
Flowers.

595
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:08,050
Fully blooming flowers.

596
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,160
Where did you go?

597
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:31,430
- Oh, just for a moment— 
 - Where were you?

598
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:37,570
I'm sorry.

599
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:39,950
I thought you just left.

600
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:42,270
I thought you disappeared.

601
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:46,100
When I opened my eyes and you weren't there, I seriously–

602
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:49,150
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

603
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:52,620
I just closed my eyes for a bit and opened them, and I thought

604
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:56,030
did a day pass already? Did two days pass?

605
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:59,910
Is it all over? That's what I thought!

606
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:02,500
I don't have any time...

607
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:06,370
I really don't have much time left.

608
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:09,330
It's okay. I'm still here.

609
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:13,310
We still have one day.

610
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:20,020
I don't think I can do this.

611
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,780
I tried not to,

612
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:26,330
and I don't want to do that either, but–

613
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:27,920
Do what?

614
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:33,040
Can you wish for me to not love anyone?

615
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,870
Not anyone.

616
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:37,690
That's my wish.

617
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:43,550
I can't do that.

618
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:45,400
I told you it's my wish!

619
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,860
That was under our contract! Why can't I do that?

620
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:50,410
Because I need to save you.

621
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:52,920
If I survive because of that,

622
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,580
everything is meaningless!

623
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:59,840
It is meaningful. To me.

624
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,560
After losing you,

625
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,160
after losing everyone you love,

626
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,110
in that empty world, I may have to live for eternity.

627
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,540
Dong Kyeong.

628
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:26,170
Humans...

629
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:31,890
Humans can love again.

630
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:34,540
No...

631
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,570
Because they are humans.

632
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:40,720
You can overcome that. I can't.

633
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:43,880
You know, right?

634
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:47,380
I don't eat, sleep, or cry.

635
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,500
I don't feel sympathy or love.

636
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:54,040
But you are human.

637
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,020
So you can.

638
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:00,890
I can't. Without you,

639
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:03,990
I seriously can't...

640
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:13,340
Don't be like that. Don't say that.

641
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:17,940
I did wrong. I did wrong, so–

642
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:27,390
I did wrong!

643
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:52,280
I have a real wish.

644
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:00,710
I want you to take me to

645
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:02,810
the doomed world.

646
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:07,960
That's impossible.

647
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,990
I'm not asking you to actually take me there.

648
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:15,470
It's fine if it's just a lie.

649
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:19,220
Even if it's just a dream or imagination.

650
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:21,320
Just for one day,

651
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,980
I want to be with you for one last day there.

652
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,570
Grant me this wish.

653
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:34,210
This is really my wish.

654
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:07,900
So here...

655
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,090
This is the doomed world.

656
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:08,040
Seriously, no one is–

657
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,440
My voice sounds way too loud.

658
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,950
Since there is no sound here.

659
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,760
It's so strange.

660
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,780
It will be lonely.

661
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:29,660
In this doomed world, I am no longer Doom.

662
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:34,690
I am nothing.

663
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:49,860
The fact that I have a responsibility in everything that disappears means

664
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:55,490
because of everything that disappears, I can exist.

665
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,680
In this world where nothing is left to disappear,

666
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:07,410
I am... just like suspended dust.

667
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:17,680
So that's why I'm saying it's meaningless.

668
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,370
My existence without you.

669
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:27,420
It looks lonely.

670
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:32,370
Your face watching things that disappear.

671
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:38,250
Even still, it looks lonely.

672
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:41,090
Same for you.

673
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,410
They're always lonely.

674
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:47,390
Your eyes watching me.

675
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,340
I have somewhere I want to go to.

676
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,520
Why here?

677
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,370
I want to pray.

678
01:01:25,370 --> 01:01:28,020
There is no God in a doomed world.

679
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:31,900
Since there are no humans?

680
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,540
Yeah.

681
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:36,120
But I'm here.

682
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,940
In this world, the human,

683
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:42,130
I'm here.

684
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:35,980
Night still comes in a doomed world...

685
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:41,990
At the cathedral earlier, what did you pray for?

686
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,920
It's a secret between me and God.

687
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,150
You said God doesn't exist in this world.

688
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:50,590
The moment you wished for one, God may have been born.

689
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:57,180
What did you pray for?

690
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:59,170
I...

691
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:07,940
I just... wished for the last time that I will not love anyone.

692
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:14,460
I know. It's a wish and a prayer that will not come true.

693
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,900
But I still gave it a try.

694
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:30,320
Dong Kyeong...

695
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,400
I love you.

696
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:40,420
In the end, the person I loved the most is you.

697
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:45,390
I'm sorry. For loving you.

698
01:03:46,970 --> 01:03:49,950
For loving you the most, I'm sorry.

699
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,710
Thank you.

700
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:57,290
For loving me.

701
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:22,980
♫  In the distant future, you and I...  ♫

702
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:29,960
♫  The seasons we'll be living face to face  ♫

703
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:36,740
♫  The countless emotions  ♫

704
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:43,870
♫  I just want to be with you  ♫

705
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,950
♫  Only you  ♫

706
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:02,830
It's almost 12 o'clock.

707
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,580
It's okay.

708
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:15,790
Everything is okay.

709
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,230
I wanted to be with you until the very last moment.

710
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:44,810
I know.

711
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:49,690
I love you...

712
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:53,190
I know.

713
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,750
I'm so scared.

714
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:02,350
- Dong Kyeong— 
 - Don't say anything.

715
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:05,790
Don't say... anything.

716
01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:08,310
This contract is void.

717
01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:10,220
No.

718
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:12,330
No.

719
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:17,340
Your sadness and pain, I will take them all.

720
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:21,430
Don't worry. I will take them all.

721
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:23,530
No, you can't.

722
01:06:25,470 --> 01:06:27,580
I don't want you to.

723
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:33,950
I was created for you.

724
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:36,500
So don't cry.

725
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,820
Live happily.

726
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:45,340
I was born to do that. To make you happy.

727
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:48,090
Can you not leave?

728
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:52,700
Seriously, can you not?

729
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,200
The wish I made at the cathedral earlier.

730
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:01,620
I wished for your happiness.

731
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:04,920
Then you have to be here.

732
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:09,190
You have to be here.

733
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:15,110
Do you remember what I told you last time?

734
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:19,440
Even if it rains, even if you're the only one without an umbrella, it's not a big deal.

735
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:23,180
If you run, you'll reach home quickly.

736
01:07:27,090 --> 01:07:29,720
Even if I disappear, run.

737
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:33,590
Don't look back and run.

738
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:36,000
Then you will quickly...

739
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:37,020

740
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:43,580
♫  I wanna be with you  ♫

741
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:46,620
♫  At the end of a tiring day  ♫

742
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:53,690
♫  Without a sound, come to me and hug me   ♫

743
01:08:53,690 --> 01:09:01,310
♫  Wait for me at the end of this road  ♫

744
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:06,570

♫  My feelings for you can't be hidden  ♫

745
01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:09,290
 Did everything actually happen?

746
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:16,320
 Did you really stay by my side?

747
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:19,120
 - Do you not need anything? 
 - Hyung.

748
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,990
 Unni, do you not call Cha Joo Ik?

749
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:28,250
 Today, we all ate together and everyone said they miss you.

750
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:33,620
 If I pass you by, like you always did, can you grab my hand?

751
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:37,520
 You're happy, right?

752
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,120
♫   ...shines because of you  ♫

753
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:43,160
♫  Just you alone  ♫

754
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,140
♫  Beyond this deepening sadness  ♫
