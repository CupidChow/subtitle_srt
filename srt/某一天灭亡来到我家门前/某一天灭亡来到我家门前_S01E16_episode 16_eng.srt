00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,040

00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:33,730

00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,510

9
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:15,750
♫  I still with you, I'm still here  ♫

10
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:22,620
♫  Do you still remember the day we first met?  ♫

11
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,270
♫  I still with you, again today, like this  ♫

12
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,720
Did you bring an umbrella? It's raining outside.

13
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:36,190
What... What are you?

14
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:43,140
♫  When I close my eyes  ♫

15
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,750
A hand-holder.

16
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:50,980
♫  It feels like I'm walking through a dream with you  ♫

17
00:01:53,540 --> 00:02:00,530
♫  You, don't forget  ♫

18
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,180
♫  Just once is enough  ♫

19
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,760
♫  Leave it as a memory  ♫

20
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:14,290
♫  You, I'll tell you now  ♫

21
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,180
♫  Love you, love you  ♫

22
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:24,150
♫  I only need you  ♫

23
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:33,070
♫  I still with you, the dark days of the past  ♫

24
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,440
I can't stop rain anymore.

25
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,900
I have to use an umbrella when it rains like you guys.

26
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,870
Because...

27
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,130
I became like you guys.

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,580
I can't get sick.

29
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,420
If I get sick, you'll worry.

30
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,360
It's too much work. I think I'm not going to like rainy days.

31
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,310
♫  Will I be able to hold your hand?  ♫

32
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,990
This isn't a dream, right?

33
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,450
You're real, right?

34
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:24,250
I didn't want to get rained on, but I guess it can't be helped.

35
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:30,750
♫  You, I'll tell you now  ♫

36
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,150
Let's make today an exception.

37
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:40,900
♫  I only need you  ♫

38
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,390
♫  You... You  ♫

39
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:49,880
♫  Wherever... Whenever  ♫

40
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:55,260
♫  Because it's only you  ♫

41
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,760
Stop staring at me. You'll puncture me.

42
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,590
What happened?

43
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,100
Where have you been all this time?

44
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,990
- I experienced hell. 
 - No joking around.

45
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,700
I was in that garden.

46
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,770
Did she send you back?

47
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,280
No, she had me born.

48
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,720
Thanks to you, I grew up well to her liking.

49
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,610
That's how I came back.

50
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,010
What do you mean?

51
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,810
You saw the flowers in that garden.

52
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,920
They are all you guys.

53
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,340
She and I are gardeners who manage that garden.

54
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:22,350
To be exact, I was only a butterfly for that garden.

55
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,050
- Then? 
 - Then I bloomed.

56
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,100
By dying for you.

57
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,550
- Then are you— 
 - I'm not Doom anymore.

58
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm just a human like you.

59
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,880
Would that be okay with you?

60
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,770
Even if I'm nothing now,

61
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,270
even if I can't do anything for you anymore.

62
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,000
I missed you so much.

63
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,900
You wouldn't be able to say that if you knew how I lived with these feelings.

64
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:06,560
Right. It must have been so.

65
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:22,490
You must have lived many days thinking of me.

66
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:35,460
Sorry, you're hungry but this is all I've got.

67
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,620
Actually, I'll go and get something.

68
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:52,160
If I knew, I would've gotten some groceries.

69
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,880
This is your first meal as a human.

70
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,260
You didn't know.

71
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,410
You didn't know we'd meet again.

72
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,660
You didn't know I'd come back as a human.

73
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,410
I really thought it was all over.

74
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,350
I can't believe it.

75
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,620
That I have to eat because I'm hungry and I have to sleep because I'm sleepy.

76
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,090
That I can see you.

77
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,240
That maybe I'll get sick then get better.

78
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,220
That I can live like this with you, then die together.

79
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,650
I can't believe it either.

80
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,590
This is good.

81
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,420
This isn't a dream, right?

82
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,390
No, it's not.

83
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,160
Is it really not?

84
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,620
No, it can't be a dream.

85
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,570
Don't disappear.

86
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,020
Okay.

87
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,950
Never.

88
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:26,850
♫  I wanna be with you  ♫

89
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,900
♫  At the end of a tiring day  ♫

90
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,950
♫  Without a sound, come to me  ♫

91
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,820
♫  And hug me  ♫

92
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:44,560
♫  Wait for me at the end of this road  ♫

93
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,120
♫  My feelings for you are unstoppable  ♫

94
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,160
♫  I wanna be with you  ♫

95
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,570
You're up?

96
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,550
You have to go to work, right?

97
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:26,250
What? Did you have a bad dream?

98
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,420
I thought you left.

99
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,970
How can you bring your boyfriend to work?

100
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,650
He doesn't have any friends.

101
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,100
I couldn't leave him at home all alone.

102
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,420
Why can't you leave an adult all by himself?

103
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,230
Well, because I feel...

104
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,630
- He feels like a kid? 
 - No, he's not a kid.

105
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:55,120
But I'm all he's got right now.

106
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,640
Why? He has bad human relationships?

107
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,220
Yes, he has bad relationships.

108
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:05,100
Because he... wasn't.

109
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,590
What wasn't he?

110
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:10,170
H-Here... He wasn't from here.

111
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,760
You said you have a meeting with Writer Dalgona. You're not taking him with you, are you?

112
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,820
- I am taking him with me. 
 - Hey! You should separate work and personal life—

113
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,760
He has a car and he's a good driver.

114
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,490
I love your attitude that you treat work and personal life the same.

115
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,890
Just what a team leader needs.

116
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,750
Boss, you seem like a real boss when you're like this.

117
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,500
- When is "like this"? 
 - When you change your words depending on profit.

118
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,630
So trustworthy, right? Don't I seem like I'll grow the company really well?

119
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,720
Not sure about that but I don't think we'll go bankrupt.

120
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,730
If you go to the meeting and get the contract signed, we won't go bankrupt.

121
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,010
I will try.

122
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,960
Let's go.

123
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,050
If you don't like your boss, should I kill him?

124
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:10,020
You can't kill anymore.

125
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,270
That's right.

126
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,130
But there is something you can do.

127
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,480
You can drive.

128
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,330
We'll be back.

129
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,670
Don't come back. Go home from there.

130
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,380
Okay.

131
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,670
A class reunion? Again?

132
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,720
 It's so nice we get to see each other often.

133
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,440
 This time Eun Bi, Da Yeong, and Jeong Hwa are really coming.

134
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,150
 I asked Ji Na too, but I haven't heard back yet.

135
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,650
 - You're coming, right?  
 - I'll see.

136
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,540
 What do you mean you'll see? Come.

137
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,280
I'm busy. Bye.

138
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,160
I'll call you later.

139
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,840
Why are you bringing that here?

140
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,550
You can tell that's for a grand opening.

141
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,810
If you brought it for a grand opening, it should be at the opening place.

142
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,600
It's for you. Joo Ik Hyungnim sent it.

143
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,390
 Raise it as if it were me.

144
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,450
He said to raise it as if it were him. Don't you think you should raise it?

145
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,000
That's why I brought it.

146
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,220
I told him I need him and he sends a plant with his name on it.

147
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,120
He must be wanting me to pay him back by raising that like he raised me.

148
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,600
Put it over there.

149
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,520
- Over there? 
 - Yeah.

150
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,200
Yes, Noona.

151
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,540
Me? I'm at the main branch. What is it?

152
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,360
But the face that Seon Kyeong knows wouldn't be you.

153
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,450
Tell him you got a new boyfriend.

154
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,980
Gosh, what would that make me?

155
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:53,180
A popular girl. A girl who's popular among guys who drive this car.

156
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,960
I didn't think about the car!

157
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,720
I'm so detailed.

158
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,010
Here, here, here.

159
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,510
Welcome.

160
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,750
Hey.

161
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,970
So this is what happened.

162
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,410
He is...

163
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,540
Hyungnim!

164
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,790
Hyungnim!

165
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,200
Hyungnim! Do you know how much I missed you?

166
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,490
I really missed you.

167
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,640
Hyungnim!

168
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,600
Me, too.

169
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,180
I-It's great to see the emotional reunion.

170
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:41,410
But look at him. Doesn't he look different?

171
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,580
No, he looks the same.

172
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,770
The same mole here.

173
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:51,820
He's the same? It can't be.

174
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,520
Look, he's the same.

175
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,710
Isn't he? Did he gain some weight?

176
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,500
H-How...?

177
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,510
No?

178
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,940
He's the same.

179
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,420

180
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,950
I'm pretty nice.

181
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,680
Ji Eun! Let's go.

182
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,960
Coming.

183
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,090
What are you doing?

184
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,220
What is that?

185
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,760
Hmm? A new thing I'm growing.

186
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,410
What are you growing?

187
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,520
I don't know until it sprouts.

188
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,060
Let me know when it's all bloomed.

189
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,800
Let's hurry. The tteokbokki place is going to close.

190
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,060
Hurry.

191
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:16,430
So... it's something that she did?

192
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,580
Can't be explained otherwise.

193
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,780
She did it.

194
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,370
This is so amazing.

195
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,020
It's not that amazing.

196
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,600
Isn't it amazing that I'm by your side?

197
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,170
It is amazing.

198
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,840
It doesn't look like it's that amazing.

199
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,960
Actually, it's more like I'm always impressed rather than amazed.

200
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,360
You can say such things?

201
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,180
I can say things more intense.

202
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:49,160
By the way, you met your brother when you said you're going to a meeting.

203
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,740
Is it okay to lie like that?

204
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,080
It's fine.

205
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,450
He always says he's going to a meeting, then goes to Unnie's house.

206
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,530
I know it all. I just pretend not to know.

207
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:02,490
And I can go to the meeting now.

208
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,610
Now?

209
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,290
Let's test it one more time.

210
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,250
Where are we going?

211
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,030
Where are we going?

212
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,310
You still haven't broken up?

213
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,170
He recognized me, too.

214
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:22,030
What does that mean? Do you think I'm stupid?

215
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:26,330
Writer, look at him closely.

216
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,540
Doesn't he look different?

217
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,480
He looks the same.

218
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,670
What's the same?

219
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:37,910
Then or now, you're still annoying.

220
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,910
You rascal.

221
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,360
Why aren't you answering my question? Are you still together?

222
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,100
We won't part until death.

223
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,880
I didn't ask you.

224
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,060
Dang.

225
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,700
Can I hit him?

226
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,350
No.

227
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:05,090
I'll bring some drinks and desserts. You two should calm down.

228
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,980
You might be happy now, but you don't know what will happen.

229
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,930
We're getting married.

230
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,080
You never know until you step on the altar. You have to see it till the end.

231
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:24,210
It'll be faster for us to walk to the altar than you turning twenty.

232
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,340
How did you know?

233
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,880
Know what? That you like her?

234
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,130
How did you know?

235
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,430
How can I not know?

236
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,000
I could tell from the first time I saw you at the tteokbokki place.

237
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,490
D-Did you tell her?

238
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,460
- Should I? 
 - Don't!

239
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,100
Why not?

240
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,590
J-Just in case she finds it too cute.

241
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,720
That was random.

242
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,530
Do you think you're cute?

243
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,460
Here.

244
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,210
I'm busy so I have to go. Goodbye.

245
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,740
I just got the drinks.

246
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,680
Leave him. Maybe he needs to run away.

247
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,530
Anyway, call me soon.

248
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,680
Wait, Writer.

249
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,440
Can you do me a favor before you leave?

250
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,920
Please?

251
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,300
Please?

252
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,520
What is it? Say it.

253
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,970
Hold on.

254
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:43,160
Yes, Writer. Come straight ahead—

255
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,400
It's Park Yeong.

256
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,300
Let's have a personal fan meeting.

257
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,300
Just for thirty minutes.

258
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,520
No, just for twenty minutes.

259
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,380
What?

260
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,930
You didn't tell me we were meeting him.

261
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,930
I also didn't say we were not meeting him.

262
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:17,160
What a nice opportunity is this? We can test and work.

263
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,500
Two birds with one stone.

264
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:24,390
Thanks to him, Writer Dalgona signed the contract.

265
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,240
And I paid her back. This is also two birds with one stone.

266
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,750
Still, I don't like him.

267
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,770
Why do you hate him so much?

268
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:34,860
How can you not hate him?

269
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,950
Why? He's cute.

270
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,850
Don't you think that could be the problem?

271
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,380
Did you see his expression change?

272
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,390
He's like that. He totally did that to me.

273
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,410
Even if I don't like him, what can I do?

274
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:18,140
He's the top writer for our company.

275
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:26,420
It's not midnight yet. It'll be a while until it's 12.

276
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,630
We don't have such a contract anymore.

277
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,160
Oh, right.

278
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,530
We can hold hands for no reason.

279
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:37,460
That's true.

280
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:41,380
But that kiddo—

281
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,980
You're here.

282
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,870
We're back.

283
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,830
Hi, Brother-in-Law.

284
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,050
What? Say hello.

285
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,230
I'm back.

286
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,850
 Thank you.

287
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,860
Welcome.

288
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,590
Hi.

289
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:29,280
Hi. Are you here to get your hair done?

290
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,550
Yeah.

291
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:35,910
This is a salon. Of course, you came to get your hair done.

292
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,910
I heard Da Yeong works here.

293
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:41,780
Da Yeong is good. I often come here because of her.

294
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,250
Did you get your hair done? It looks good.

295
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,610
Oh, and I heard your friend is all better now.

296
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:55,740
How did you know?

297
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,630
Seon Kyeong told me everything. Even that you guys know each other.

298
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,380
Oh... Seon Kyeong...

299
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:07,400
Yes, she's all better. She's healthy now.

300
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,080
That's good. I was worried.

301
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,630
I got a call for a class reunion.

302
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,170
Yes, I got it, too.

303
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,320
Are you going?

304
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,960
No.

305
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,100
Okay. Bye.

306
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,080
Therefore, I'm not a part-timer anymore.

307
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,700
I'm the manager of the second cafe.

308
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,770
Really?

309
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,970
I'm so proud of you.

310
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,260
I really don't have anything to worry about.

311
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,580
Finally, Sis and Brother-in-Law are doing something up there.

312
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,350
Now they're doing something.

313
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,560
Seon Kyeong, that's great, man.

314
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,600
Great!

315
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,890
You finally fulfilled your dream.

316
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,250
Is it after about 49 tries?

317
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:25,460
It's after eight... Wait, is it the ninth?

318
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,950
That's not important. The fact he's doing something is the important thing.

319
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:37,030
You're eating so well today. You were always picking at the food before.

320
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,980
He must've missed Korean food so much.

321
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,560
- Right, Hyungnim?
 - Yeah.

322
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,330
I missed it all.

323
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,100
Gosh, you!

324
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,310
Look at you over-react.

325
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,600
When will you move in here?

326
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,050
W-When?

327
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:04,390
Well, I thought about it but it's closer to work from there—

328
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,400
No.

329
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,810
You have to move in. I'm going to live with you until you get married.

330
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,450
Aunt, you're too dense!

331
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:16,730
It's because there's no place for her to date him.

332
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:20,490
If that's the problem, we have my place.

333
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,350
There are enough rooms.

334
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,350
So, you own a house?

335
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,060
With many rooms?

336
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,860
Yes, the house is quite big.

337
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:37,040
Oh, so you're all done in the US?

338
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,980
So I was in the US?

339
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,430
Wasn't he?

340
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,540
I was.

341
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:55,520
So, what are you trying to do in Korea to make a living?

342
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:02,440
I'm going to do what I've been doing.

343
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,870

344
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:32,380
Coming through!  Coming through!

345
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,660

346
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,810
It's a traffic accident.

347
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:50,930
Thankfully, she doesn't have many external injuries, but she's pregnant and complains of a stomachache.

348
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:54,860
First, call OB-GYN and pediatrics just in case.

349
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:03,090
Patient, can you hear me?

350
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,000
My baby...

351
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,130
Please save my baby.

352
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:13,480
How many weeks are you?

353
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,510
Her blood pressure is dropping.

354
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,960
I called the OB-GYN and they'll be here in ten minutes.

355
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,220
She's not doing well.

356
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,970
There is a possibility of cerebral hemorrhage so she should be sent to OR immediately.

357
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,400
Call the anesthesiologist, OB-GYN, and pediatrics.

358
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,260
Yes, sir.

359
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:34,920
Writer, congratulations.

360
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,790
This is a present to congratulate you.

361
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,390
What... are you congratulating?

362
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,270
I heard you're expecting.

363
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,660
How did you...?

364
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,460
Well, there are so many ears in the hospital.

365
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,860
I got to hear something.

366
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,140
I'll be there for the first birthday party.

367
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:54,960
No need! You even came to our wedding.

368
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,840
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

369
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:02,170
And this is a new contract that I mentioned before.

370
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,700
Huh? So suddenly?

371
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:08,150
The details are all in the paper so look over them carefully.

372
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:11,490
I know you're busy with your current job, but please go over the conditions

373
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:14,770
and I look forward to a positive answer.

374
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,090
Editor, tell me the truth.

375
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,460
Congratulating was an excuse and you're here for this, right?

376
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:23,360
Well... for both.

377
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:27,090
There is no need to think. Of course, I'll sign.

378
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:30,800
Still, you should go over the conditions first then let me know.

379
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,570
I'm really confident this time.

380
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,390

381
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,010
We're really confident—

382
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,720
Sorry.

383
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,600
Yes, I'm almost done.

384
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,660
I'm on my way right now. Okay.

385
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,840
Sorry. He's not good at picking the right time.

386
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,530
Who... was it?

387
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:57,940
My boyfriend.

388
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:02,560
That boyfriend who went far? Is he finally back?

389
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,020
Yes.

390
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:12,410
Doctor.

391
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:17,430
You're handsome today as well. You must be going somewhere.

392
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:21,310
Yes, I'm going on a date with my girlfriend.

393
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:25,180
It's so nice out, perfect for a date.

394
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,560
Hello.

395
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,450
It seems like yesterday when you were contemplating getting married.

396
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:36,540
Now, you're all better.

397
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,170
You really don't know what'll happen.

398
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:43,100
Back then, I didn't know he'd become a doctor in this hospital.

399
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,210
Right.

400
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:47,350
So, when are you getting married?

401
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,100
Well.. we don't know yet.

402
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:56,550
We'll get going. You two should get healthy and get out of here, soon.

403
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:00,550
We're fake. Fake patients.

404
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:03,710
We were too inconsiderate.

405
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:07,280
Have fun, you two.

406
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,320
You haven't been speaking about the ghost recently.

407
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,870
I haven't heard anything so there's nothing to talk about.

408
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,090
I think he went over there.

409
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:27,310
Is that so?

410
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,640
I hope he's doing well.

411
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,960
Wait up!

412
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:40,130
How can you be a real doctor?

413
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:42,280
I didn't live so long for nothing.

414
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,540
Does it suit you? Is it doable?

415
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,590
It doesn't suit me since it's not what I've been doing.

416
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:49,900
Aren't you too good to be saying that?

417
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,790
I wanted to do it. Saving people.

418
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,930
What are you going to do with your name? You're really sticking with Kim Sa Ram?

419
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,300
I like it because you named me.

420
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,920
Why do you like the name I just whipped up?

421
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,740
You just whipped it up?

422
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,210
I just whipped it up.

423
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:12,520
Now that I think about it, I guess it was meant to be like this.

424
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,280
I really do realize as I live.

425
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,560
If I knew, then I should have come up with a name more for a lead character.

426
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,130
Mmm... Kim Sa Ram...

427
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,690
When are we getting married?

428
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:38,710
What marriage?

429
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:41,140
Did you have a change of heart?

430
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,290
You don't like me because I'm normal now?

431
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:46,750
Why? Do you not like me because I'm normal?

432
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,750
You were never normal.

433
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:55,640
From the first time we met till now, you were always special to me.

434
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:01,890
Wow, I know it's your trick, but my heart did flutter a little.

435
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:04,880
What do you mean trick? It's my sincere heart.

436
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,630
- How are you adapting? Is it okay? 
 - Yeah.

437
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:12,130
One thing that's inconvenient is that I can't read people's minds anymore.

438
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:15,640
But it's also kind of convenient.

439
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,730
There are things you try more because you don't know.

440
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:22,630
You really became a human.

441
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,240
Since destiny doesn't change.

442
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,650
I didn't really put my hands on things that I could see the end of.

443
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:35,120
But since I can't see the end anymore, I keep on trying.

444
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,970
Sometimes, I thought it was the end

445
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,560
but it turned out to be the beginning.

446
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,610
Maybe that's how you guys live forever.

447
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,650
Humans are all terminal.

448
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,820
They only live eternally when they don't know that.

449
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,180
What you said before?

450
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,700
When I lived eternally, it always felt terminal.

451
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,940
But now that I'm terminal,

452
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,850
I feel like I'm living eternally.

453
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:04,710
Live eternally with me.

454
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,940
Is that a proposal?

455
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,080
It's not.

456
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:25,010
Staying like this reminds me of back then.

457
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:31,760
The time we saw the sunset together in the world with just the two of us.

458
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:38,740
I couldn't forget your face then for a long time.

459
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,610
How about now?

460
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,250
You look comfortable.

461
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,490
You don't look lonely.

462
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,800
I'm not lonely.

463
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:59,060
Now I have a direction I'm going toward.

464
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,300
It's you.

465
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:10,240
You can't even send a text message, but you're so good at talking.

466
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,540
Why can't I send a text?

467
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:17,020
When you disappeared last time, I found your phone at your house.

468
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:20,620
You wrote the text messages but never sent them.

469
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,260
You sent a lot.

470
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:26,240
Did you see them all? But why did you not mention it?

471
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,640
- I'm saying it now. 
 - No–

472
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:31,070
But it's so weird.

473
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:37,180
That phone... How did it not turn off for three months and was still there?

474
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:45,250
I'm sure it was her doing.

475
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,850
I wonder what she's up to.

476
00:33:56,550 --> 00:34:01,020
I'm sure she's doing well no matter where she is.

477
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,630
While still loving humans.

478
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:10,910
I wondered why she loved humans before.

479
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:16,310
I didn't get why they said love stems from hate.

480
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,300
I'm sure she hated them in the beginning.

481
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,880
And then she probably forgave.

482
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:30,060
Then from some point, she was grateful that they created her.

483
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:36,340
I understand it all now. Since that was the case for me, too.

484
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:45,840
It's cold. Let's go. Or we're going to catch a cold.

485
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:51,380
Hey.

486
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,930
How does it feel to live?

487
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,650
It's good.

488
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,220
Wow!  It's crazy!

489
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,150
Did you see that I'm on the Top 10 now?

490
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:27,820
It's really my first time.

491
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,120
Congrats.

492
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,190
Seriously, this is awesome.

493
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:35,150
See. Romance didn't suit me.

494
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,500
I get that.

495
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,440
But isn't the main character modeled after me?

496
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:46,090
Well... that's true, but I added some imagination on top of that.

497
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:48,410
Do I seem like a devil to you?

498
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:50,000
Why did I have to come from Devildom out of all places?

499
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,400
That's not the important part. What's important is that he's the building owner.

500
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,150
So are you offended by that?

501
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:58,300
Do you know how sexy Lucifer and the devil are?

502
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,390
- So I'm sexy? 
- Yes.

503
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,980
- No. 
 - I'm not?

504
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,860
What? Yeah.

505
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,600
No.

506
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,920
Did you get your hair done?

507
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,390
Yeah. A little bit.

508
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:18,220
I got a very short trim. How did you notice?

509
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,170
So you can go to the school reunion?

510
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,470
No. That...

511
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,520
Because I heard you were coming.

512
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,420
What are those eyes?

513
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,470
What is this hand?

514
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:51,840
Well, because you were suddenly like this.

515
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,160
Do you want to drink with me today?

516
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,720
Drink? Why?

517
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,860
Let's drink. I feel like drinking today.

518
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:11,450
I was really curious how I would feel when I was placed in the top ranking.

519
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:14,260
So being part of the Top 10 feels like this.

520
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:18,640
It's heavy and scary, but I feel like I can fly.

521
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,460
I'm so happy.

522
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,560
In the next episode, the Demon King buys and takes over the demons in the modern world

523
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,790
and sends them away to the building next door.

524
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:29,520
The house prices will go down. Then he will buy that, then—

525
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:46,130
And... What is it?

526
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:50,950
The house prices will go down, then he will buy that, then sell it again.

527
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,840
Are you not surprised?

528
00:37:54,780 --> 00:38:00,430
Honestly, I expected it a bit.

529
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:05,130
- Really? 
 - Well, I was a romance writer in the past.

530
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:30,920
♫  You, when quietly I look at you  ♫

531
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:34,480
You didn't expect that, right?

532
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,750
I did slightly expect this as well.

533
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:43,400
Then, I will proceed with the storyline like how you expected.

534
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,250
♫  You keep seeping into my heart  ♫

535
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:49,610
♫  Your fragrant little smiles  ♫

536
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,770
What are you going to do?

537
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:53,150
What?

538
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:57,070
My girlfriend... Do you want to be that or not?

539
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:01,460
What if I choose not to do that?

540
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,250
I will cry.

541
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,960
If I start crying, will you just pass me by?

542
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,130
No. I will hold the umbrella over you.

543
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,350
How can you say that?

544
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,950
You shouldn't make me cry in the first place.

545
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:16,270
Okay, okay. I won't make you cry.

546
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,340
You promised just now that you won't.

547
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,790
Okay, I won't make you cry.

548
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,990
- What are you doing tomorrow? 
 - Why?

549
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:29,770
If you're off tomorrow, I wanted to play with you longer.

550
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:31,140
Were you always this kind of person?

551
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,210
I don't know what kind of person you're referring to,

552
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:37,420
but I'm slightly out of it at the moment.

553
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:41,270
I'm not off tomorrow. I have plans.

554
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:43,240
What are you doing? Let's do it together.

555
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,740
Do you want to do it together? Really?

556
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,880
Yeah. What is it?

557
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,460
Put it down over there.

558
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:00,560
Why are we suddenly making kimchi?

559
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,010
To commemorate coming back to Korea, we should make some kimchi.

560
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,180
Aunt's kimchi is delicious.

561
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:09,060
You can finish an entire bowl of rice with it.

562
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,480
Don't you think this is way too much?

563
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,460
Can we do this all by ourselves?

564
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,790
More people are coming.

565
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,490
Who?

566
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:19,560
Aunt! I'm here!

567
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,660
- I also brought rice wine. 
 - What?

568
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,240
It just happened this way.

569
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,570
- Hello. 
 - Oh, hello!

570
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:28,440
I heard that you are our Ji Na's boyfriend.

571
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,600
Yes.

572
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:34,820
- And... he is my CEO. 
 - What?

573
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,320
Joo Ik Hyungnim!

574
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:40,080
Hyungnim? How do you know him?

575
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:45,970
Joo Ik Hyungnim and I shared deep secrets with each other.

576
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:47,570
Isn't that right, Hyungnim?

577
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,720
That's right.

578
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,140
Hey, we came because we thought you would need more help.

579
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,380
Isn't it better to have more hands on deck?

580
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,780
- If you don't like him, I will kill– 
 -Shh!

581
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,880
Put them in here. Over here.

582
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,810
- I got it. 
 - You guys are doing great.

583
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:15,770
How did you follow her to a place like this?

584
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:16,970
Didn't you follow her here, too?

585
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:19,300
I'm part of this family.

586
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,440
Are you guys married?

587
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,600
No. We will soon.

588
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,360
- I thought... 
 - I thought?

589
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,180
You only know that until you reach the end.

590
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:32,700
Why are there so many bastards who say that I have to go all the way to the end?

591
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,220
There's nobody else who went all the way to the end as me.

592
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:38,480
Hey, Hyungnim, Hyungnim! You have to really get the sauce incorporated!

593
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,250
Who?

594
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,720
Brother-in-Law!

595
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,820
- Which one! 
 - Which one?

596
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:49,480
Noona, I'm so tired.

597
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:04,160
Our aunt and uncle's cups are empty.

598
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,830
As the youngest person here, I will pour you a glass.

599
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:08,520
- Thank you. 
 - Uncle, you first.

600
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:11,910
Here, Aunt too.

601
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:16,040
Thank you.

602
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,080
Hyungnim, do you not drink?

603
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,440
I quit drinking.

604
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,810
It's bad for your health.

605
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:28,020
I want to live for a long time.

606
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,010
Health! Health is great.

607
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:34,460
You have to be healthy, right.

608
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,020
I hope you live for a hundred years with Sis.

609
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:42,680
Drink!

610
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,490
Joo Ik Hyungnim, are you not drinking?

611
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:50,320
I drank a lot yesterday.

612
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,820
Then, what do I become?

613
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:57,060
What is this? You guys drank together?

614
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,780
You said you only do work-related things with a writer!

615
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,250
You told me to hold onto her as a woman, not as a writer.

616
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:02,940
When did I say that? You're really phrasing it weird.

617
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:05,840
I told you to hold onto her as a woman and a writer. I didn't tell you guys to drink.

618
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,670
You held onto me after you drank, too.

619
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,190
Is this how the behind-the-story of your first encounter is going to be revealed?

620
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:14,470
Was Noona drunk and asked for your number first?

621
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:16,920
Well, basically.

622
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:21,770
You're funny. You're the one who pushed yourself into my house.

623
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:24,240
Tak Dong Kyeong?

624
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,110
No, Aunt, that's not it.

625
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:28,210
You really...

626
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:30,840
No, this runs in the family.

627
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,910
Runs in the family.

628
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:36,280
So, when did you guys start dating?

629
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,950
Why didn't you tell me that you guys were officially dating?

630
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:43,650
- It's not that... 
 - Today is the second day.

631
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:47,080
Wow, awesome. Invite me to your 100th day party!

632
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:50,060
Who celebrates that nowadays? Are we in high school?

633
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:53,450
Why are you laughing?

634
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:54,850
Because it's cute.

635
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:57,040
Who is? Cha Joo Ik?

636
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,060
No way.

637
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:03,470
I was laughing because it's cute that they've been dating for two days.

638
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:06,130
How long has it been for you?

639
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:08,350
Do the number of days we've been dating really matter?

640
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:12,740
The important thing is what you put on the line for that person, and what you overcame.

641
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:15,470
It wasn't easy for us either.

642
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:18,540
We had to put our lives and destiny on the line.

643
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:22,980
I seriously can't even show this to you guys.

644
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:26,300
You don't need to show us. We saw it already.

645
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,060
You both worked hard to protect each other.

646
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,260
I'm really touched by you guys.

647
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,440
You're suddenly being this sincere?

648
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,710
Then, what do I become? Huh?

649
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:39,190
I will put it on the line, too. From now on.

650
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:42,970
You must be crazy. What do you mean by putting it on the line?

651
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:48,010
You seriously became insane after you started dating. You weren't like this before.

652
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:51,420
I... think everyone went a bit crazy.

653
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:55,430
Seriously. Little kiddos.

654
00:44:55,430 --> 00:45:00,670
You guys are so great, but honestly, Kevin and I did the most.

655
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:05,590
We overcame race, language, and cultural barriers.

656
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:09,470
- I love you, Soo. 
 - Me too. Me too. I love you.

657
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:14,830
Seriously! I can't be here any longer! Why am I the only one who is alone?

658
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:15,650
Where are you going?

659
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:16,870
To buy alcohol!

660
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:18,760
Where are you going this late by yourself?

661
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,160
If I call Sang Geun on the way, I'll be fine alone.

662
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,310
It seems like he's dating Sang Geun.

663
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:26,800
Love that overcame gender.

664
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,600
That's the most real.

665
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,380
Are you going to write that? Should I help?

666
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,710
Should I try that?

667
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:37,390
Oh right! Aunt, her new novel this time is so popular.

668
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:39,980
Ji Na, you're writing a new novel? What is it about?

669
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:43,080
So, the title is called "The Building's Owner is from Devildom."

670
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,960
Fantasy is trending nowadays.

671
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,800
- Devil or devildom? 
 - Devildom.

672
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,950
Yeah, like demons and things like that. It's a romance...

673
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:53,530
Sa Ram, follow me.

674
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:57,010
 - The Demon King deliberately bribed the demons,
lowering house prices. Then... 
 - Brings down?

675
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:59,030
 Buying it back, then...

676
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:01,620
 - I'm thinking of something like that... 
 - Unni, can even explain it.

677
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:06,110
 I'm just thinking about it.

678
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:09,440
I called you out here because I had something to say to you.

679
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,890
Are you... going to marry Dong Kyeong?

680
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:14,480
Marry?

681
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,100
Yeah.

682
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,080
Then we're family now.

683
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,510
I'm really glad you joined the family.

684
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:23,550
- Family? 
 - Yeah, family.

685
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:25,660
We are family.

686
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,230
Family...

687
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:29,220
That's a word that doesn't really suit me.

688
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,970
So, you and I have to be responsible for our families.

689
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:37,410
For the happiness of Soo Ja and Seon Kyeong and Dong Kyeong.

690
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:40,270
Of course, I'll live for your happiness as well.

691
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:42,240
Because we're family.

692
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,060
Me too.

693
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,080
Do you swear?

694
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,830
I can swear on my life.

695
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:51,240
Life?

696
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,950
You're a real man.

697
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:57,700
I'm sure... you know Ive liked you since I first saw you?

698
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,920
I don't think so. I heard it all that time.

699
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,520
Yeah. I'm glad you're back.

700
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,140
Otherwise, Soo would've found you and killed you.

701
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:10,580
It doesn't sound like a joke.

702
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:15,060
Of course, our hyungnim...

703
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,720
Is it because you grew up in America? You're able to communicate with him.

704
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,300
You're so cool.

705
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,550
Uncle! Hyungnim!

706
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:29,390
I love you.

707
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:35,280
So I have to live for this bastard now?

708
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,240
Yeah.

709
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,450
Yeah! Of course!

710
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,520
My Hyung!

711
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,530
What a strange woman.

712
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:53,740
Me? Why?

713
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,340
How do you ask me to come with you to something like this?

714
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:58,090
Why not? Wasn't it fun? You even got kimchi.

715
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:00,150
Do you not like kimchi?

716
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:02,040
I do.

717
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,390
See, you like it.

718
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:09,100
No, I like this weird Na Ji Na.

719
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,610
Stop saying stuff like that!

720
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:14,270
Why not? Do you not like it?

721
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:16,730
No, because I really like it.

722
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:18,750
My heart flutters too much.

723
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:22,690
You were good at writing those kinds of things in your novels.

724
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:24,860
How is this the same as a novel?

725
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,870
What's the difference?

726
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:34,110
But, Cha Joo Ik,

727
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:38,080
do you remember your first love?

728
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,370
Me?

729
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:44,890
You are my first love.

730
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,530
You're lying.

731
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,710
Is your first love the love you experienced for the first time?

732
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:04,540
No matter what love it is, in the beginning, it's all first.

733
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:07,880
Since love comes in many different ways, no matter how many times you experience it.

734
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:12,090
Well, with that meaning, first love?

735
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,090
It seems like you don't believe me.

736
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:22,790
If you don't, I will teach you slowly.

737
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:24,860
I'm good at teaching.

738
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,700
But when you hear things like that, does your heart flutter?

739
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:31,230
- It really flutters! 
 - I should say it more often then.

740
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:32,900
Stop it!

741
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,650
Now that you're telling me to stop, I want to do it even more.

742
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:36,660
Seriously, your personality...

743
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:38,300
Is it weird?

744
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,220
It's not as weird as your personality.

745
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,860
I'm really normal.

746
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:45,420
A weird person thinks that she is normal.

747
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,250
So do you not like that?

748
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:52,170
I like it.

749
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:00,430
I don't want to go home.

750
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:03,120
But you need to go.

751
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:08,030
- Let's go together. 
 - I have to go to work tomorrow. I can't.

752
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:09,320
I will drop you off at work.

753
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:13,890
Are you that free? You're way busier than me.

754
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:18,740
I think I chose the wrong occupation.

755
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:21,030
That's funny.

756
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:24,510
Am I becoming funny? Then smile.

757
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,410
You smiled.

758
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:31,250
Leave. Drive safe.

759
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,680
Here...

760
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:43,390
Leave!

761
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:45,820
Okay. I'm leaving.

762
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:47,580
Goodbye!

Goodbye. Call me when you get home.

Yeah, I'm home now.

776
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,450
You told me to call when I'm home.

You listen to me so well.

Did you get ready for bed?

787
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,790
Yeah. I did.

788
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:30,970
I'm lying down now.

789
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:33,200
Good job.

790
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,680
What were you doing?

791
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,690
- I was just here. 
 -  Huh?

792
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:40,320
What does it mean to be just there?

793
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,460
Oh, just...

794
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:46,080
Just...

795
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,830
Once you keep living, you'll figure it out.

796
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:51,800
I need your help right now.

797
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,340
Right now?

798
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:55,930
- Do you want me to go? 
  - No, no.

799
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:59,780
 You don't need to come here. It's something you can help me with over the phone.

800
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,690
What is it?

801
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:07,180
You know... when we met at the hospital.

802
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:10,490
What were you thinking when you hugged me?

803
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:14,310
Oh, then.

804
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:16,680
 Tak Dong Kyeong...

805
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:25,630
 It was an unstoppable feeling.

806
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:31,590
This unstoppable feeling... I wasn't sure what it was.

807
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:34,790
That's why... I just did it.

808
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:41,800
As expected, you loved me then too.

809
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,830
That's right.

810
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:46,080
 Then,

811
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:50,890
that... the day you told me you loved me after you came in front of me all of a sudden.

812
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:53,190
Why did you do that then?

813
00:53:57,950 --> 00:53:59,670
 I love you.

814
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,270
Well...

815
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,550
After I disappeared,

816
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:09,060
I realized for the first time that I can no longer see you.

817
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,250
I was so afraid of that.

818
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,500
I see.

819
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,030
That's how you were feeling.

820
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:27,890
You were more afraid of not being able to see me than disappearing?

821
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,580
It was like that for me, too.

822
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:36,230
More than dying,

823
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:38,910
I was afraid of not being able to see you.

824
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:40,430
Isn't that funny?

825
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:45,740
Are you listening?

826
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:49,980
Hello?

827
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:55,990
Are you perhaps... sleeping?

828
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:59,120
 Hey, I'm asking if you're sleeping!

829
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:08,100
Seriously, you became a human. Good night, Kim Sa Ram.

830
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:12,370
♫  In the distant future, you and I...  ♫

831
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:20,370
♫  The seasons we'll be living facing each other  ♫

832
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:23,190
♫  Among the things that scatter and pile up  ♫

833
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:28,140
 This unstoppable feeling... how should I call it?

834
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:34,780
 I do not know. So I just call "you".

835
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:39,660
 I'm not afraid of disappearing,

836
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:44,770
 but I was afraid of not being able to see you any longer.

837
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:04,890
 It's been a while.

838
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:12,530
- Wh-Where are we? 
 - Don't worry, we're inside your dream.

839
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:17,190
I came in quietly without anyone knowing. It seems like you would miss me.

840
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:22,080
You were curious about what blooms here.

841
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:27,980
It's a cosmos. Doesn't it suit him perfectly?

842
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:30,230
It's pretty.

843
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:32,350
How about me? How do I look?

844
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:37,500
Me wearing a uniform. I wanted to show it off but had no one to show off to.

845
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:40,030
You look pretty.

846
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,880
Thank you.

847
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:44,140
Me too.

848
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:47,910
Everything you've done for me.

849
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:51,190
Even if I still don't know why it was me.

850
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:53,860
I knew everything.

851
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:57,460
That you would endure through all this.

852
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,570
- You know... 
 - Yeah?

853
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:05,330
Even if you knew everything, why did you let me just do that?

854
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:08,000
I was always curious about that.

855
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:19,460
God sometimes knows everything but just does that.

856
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:23,630
Even if God knows that the flower will bloom, the sun will rise,

857
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:28,650
you will smile, I always want to see it again.

858
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,550
That's it.

859
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:35,030
I wanted to see that smile.

860
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,010
It's done. That's enough now.

861
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:44,990
Go, Dong Kyeong. Your story isn't over yet.

862
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:53,490
 His story has just begun.

863
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,580
Doctor!

864
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,160
I am the husband of the pregnant woman injured in the car accident.

865
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:06,850
It's you, right?

866
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:10,800
Before my wife lost consciousness, she looked at your name on your coat.

867
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,310
Because your name was so unique.

868
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:16,360
Do you have a problem?

869
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:21,350
No, thanks to you, my wife and the baby are healthy.

870
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:25,560
My wife really wanted me to relay how thankful she is.

871
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,470
That's a relief.

872
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:32,430
Thank you. Thank you, Doctor.

873
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:37,500
It's nothing.

874
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:42,600
I'm thankful that she survived.

875
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:06,000
- Aren't you Editor's boyfriend? 
 - Oh, hello.

876
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,320
Wow, you were a doctor? Much less a doctor here?

877
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,150
How did I not know until now?

878
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:15,340
Well, I guess the hospital here is so big.

879
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:19,560
But now that I see you like this, why did you look so young back then?

880
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,200
Is it because you weren't wearing your coat?

881
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:25,960
But do you know?

882
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,250
There are ghosts here. I saw a ghost here.

883
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:31,260
Have you seen a ghost before?

884
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:33,020
No.

885
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:38,850
Wait!  That ghost from back then... It seems like you look alike.

886
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:40,770
Are you a ghost?

887
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:49,030
I was just kidding. Why are you scared?

888
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:51,230
It's not scary, scary. You don't look alike at all.

889
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:53,630
I'm just kidding.

890
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:55,060
Do you perhaps smoke?

891
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:59,630
No. I don't smoke. Since it's bad for your health.

892
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:03,640
Right, it's bad for your health and does more harm than good.

893
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:08,490
I brought two cups because I was sleepy, but I feel like giving it to you.

894
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:21,250
What department are you in? Emergency Medicine.

895
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:25,230
Wow, you must be so busy.

896
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:27,250
Yeah, well.

897
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:33,750
Team Leader Tak, did you see? It's something that's been uploaded recently–

898
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:36,870
What was uploaded? There are not just one or two things that have been uploaded recently.

899
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:40,370
That title is long. The author's pen name is Harubang.

900
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:42,260
What?

901
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:47,320
Doom at Your Service? Or something like that.

902
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:50,000
It seemed pretty good. Did you see it?

903
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,130
Well, yeah, I did see it.

904
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:56,310
- How is that writer? 
 - W-What? What about the writer?

905
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:59,340
Why are you acting so surprised? Did you write it?

906
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:04,090
No, that... doesn't even have that many views.

907
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:05,930
That's why I'm telling you to bring the writer.

908
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:10,260
Don't you know it's my specialty to help a writer with high potential who is slightly lacking?

909
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:12,030
It's fine.

910
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:14,370
Why would it be fine for you?

911
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:16,890
- What? 
 - What?

912
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:20,020
I'm going home now.

913
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:26,740
Team Leader Tak!

914
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:33,300
Yes?

915
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:36,230
For teamwork, how about we eat out tonight?

916
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:38,290
I have plans already.

917
01:01:38,290 --> 01:01:40,600
Oh, I see.

918
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:48,490
I'm leaving.

919
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:52,770
Kids these days, really...

920
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:55,910
Thank you, please wait a moment.

921
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:58,290
Yea, I'm inside now.

922
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:01,610
I'll be waiting for you. Yeah.

923
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,880
Do you want to order?

924
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,290
Yes. One iced Americano, please.

925
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:10,800
One iced Americano. It's ₩4000.

926
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:18,630
Why do you look at me like that?

927
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:22,160
Your smile is pretty.

928
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,060
I hear that a lot.

929
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:31,700
- Why? 
 - Because you're handsome.

930
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:34,700
Oh, I hear that a lot, too.

931
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:36,460
CEO!

932
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:40,970
Oh? Hyungnim!

933
01:02:40,970 --> 01:02:43,090
- He's cute. 
 - He's cute.

934
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:49,230
What is this?

935
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,730
Are you guys friends or something?

936
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:56,100
This is my boyfriend.

937
01:02:56,100 --> 01:03:00,040
These are my forever co-workers.

938
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:03,570
He has no friends, so I want him to make some.

939
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:09,180
That's not true. I just made a friend.

940
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:22,690
See, I told you he's tall.

941
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:24,590
You're right.

942
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:28,870
He looks young for his age... But why did I think he was older?

943
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:36,610
You're always like this when there are a lot of people around.

944
01:03:36,610 --> 01:03:40,480
My boyfriend is like that too when there's lot of people around.

945
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,640
I was sorry about before.

946
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,420
What?

947
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:47,440
Before?

948
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:01,870
What is this? Are you controlling their memories?

949
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:03,750
It's so cool.

950
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:07,170
Honestly, I was a bit worried about today.

951
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:12,460
But how do you only leave behind the necessary parts?

952
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:15,140
That girl is very thorough.

953
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:16,510
Look at how she made me.

954
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:19,770
She had to make me this way and make you fall in love with me.

955
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:22,940
What are you saying? You're so funny.

956
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:26,360
When you first saw me, you thought that I was good-looking.

957
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,100
Nope.

958
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,590
Right.

959
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:34,750
Sleep over tonight.

960
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:37,700
- Dream on. 
 - Is this a dream?

961
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:41,260
It's not!

962
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:48,340
Hey, hey! Make a wish!

963
01:04:54,670 --> 01:05:00,970
♫  You who doesn't wither  ♫

964
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:02,440
♫  You who shines brighter in the dark  ♫

965
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,800
Did you make a wish?

966
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,830
- Yeah. 
 - What did you wish for?

967
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:12,800
- I'm not telling you. 
 - Why! Tell me.

968
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:17,430
- I'm not going to tell you. 
 - Seriously, you're too much.

969
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:20,280
What did you wish for?

970
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,340
I'm not going to tell you.

971
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:25,540
You're too much, you're seriously copying that?

972
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:27,540
You started first.

973
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:31,000

974
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,640
