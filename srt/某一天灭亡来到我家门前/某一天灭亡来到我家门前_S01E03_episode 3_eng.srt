1
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,630

2
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,500

3
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,880

4
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,620

5
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,860

6
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:49,980

7
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:59,180

8
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:05,000
 This drama is fiction. All characters, places, institutions, religions, and events that appear are not real.

9
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,570
  Misfortune suddenly arrives.

10
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,260
  Like an uninvited guest.

11
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,690
 But still, they're our blood relatives. We should take them in and raise them.

12
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,830
  Will you raise them then, Sister-in-Law?

13
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,220
  As if it's easy raising someone else's child.

14
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,540
  She's right. Rather than them growing up walking on eggshells,

15
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,440
  we could just send them to some facility—

16
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,400
  The children might hear.

17
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,520
 - How about Soo Ja? 
 - She got on a plane earlier.

18
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,960
  Since she's coming from Jeju Island, it'll take her a bit.

19
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,920
  Does anything change if Soo Ja comes? Even if the siblings were tight,

20
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,060
  to put it harshly, it's not like an unmarried woman is going to raise two kids.

21
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,530
  It's harder for the kids to get attached to someone than to get separated.

22
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,740
  For the future of the kids, an orphanage is the best option.

23
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,820
  Like you are really thinking about the kids!

24
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,860

25
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:14,460
  Just because it's luck doesn't mean it'll arrive nicely either.

26
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,400
  I'm going to raise the kids.

27
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,720
  You are unmarried! What are you talking about?

28
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,920
  Yes, Soo Ja, we understand how you feel, but–

29
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,650
  I said I'm going to raise them!

30
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,300
 Sometimes, the faces of misfortune and luck are the same.

31
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,360
  I still can't differentiate between

32
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,160
  those two faces.

33
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:19,680
You were the only person who was thinking the same thoughts as me at the same time.

34
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,580
I am thankful, for many reasons.

35
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,900
Hey!

36
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,620
This can't do.

37
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,860
Let's live together. Us.

38
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:11,000
  What kind of face did you come to me as?

39
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,930
  Are you luck...

40
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,700
  or misfortune?

41
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,960
 Or are you just

42
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,000
  nothing at all?

43
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay.

44
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,280
What?

45
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,630
  He's misfortune! Why are you even asking?

46
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,960
  Why would you say let's live together?

47
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,260
Let's cancel. Embarrassment will only last for a moment.

48
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,970
Hey, earlier, I was sick and said some nonsense–

49
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,020
- What is this? 
 - Even if we live together, I don't think I can live there.

50
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,820
But what, you were saying nonsense?

51
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,920
What? No, I didn't!

52
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,740
Since I was born, I have no history of saying nonsense.

53
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,670
You don't have to bring up history.

54
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,020
What is the closest history to here? 
  (T/N: 역사 (yeoksa/history) and 역 (yeok/station) sound alike, and she is making a play on the words)

55
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,090
What neighborhood is this? What subway line? 
  (T/N: 역사 (yeoksa/history) and 역 (yeok/station) sound alike, and she is making a play on the words)

56
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,490
Well, I can find out slowly.

57
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:25,430
What are these liquor bottles? Are they expensive?

58
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,800
What is this table?

59
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,530
Is this expensive?

60
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:35,370
What is this sofa? Is this also expensive?

61
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,600
Why do you keep talking to me? Don't you see that I'm reading something?

62
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,280
That's why... You only look at me when I pick a fight too.

63
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,160
You fell for me, right?

64
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,490
What?

65
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,590
- That seems to be the case. 
 - No, it's not!

66
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,630
- Okay. 
 - It's really not!

67
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,750
If that's not the case, you really have a problem. You're asking anyone to live together.

68
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,960
I said let's live together because you were not just anybody.

69
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,690
You told me to cling on to you.

70
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,940
  I'm telling you to cling on to me.

71
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,730
 To the fate that came to you.

72
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,870
You said you're fate.

73
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:14,470
You were walking away with your back facing me, and I suddenly had a thought.

74
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,360
What if he suddenly disappears without me knowing?

75
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,670
I won't.

76
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,320
You were nice to me. As if you're going to disappear.

77
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,240
People who are nice to me always disappear.

78
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,200
That was the case for me.

79
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,340
You say sad words as if they're nothing.

80
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,780
What if you don't appear when 12:00 hits?

81
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,340
What if you don't appear when I figure out my wish?

82
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,000
That's why I'm like that.

83
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,640
- Okay. 
 - That's why!

84
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,170
- I got it. 
 - I'm being serious.

85
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,880
Can't tell if you're being serious or not...

86
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,320
If I have a wish—  that's not it.

87
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,120
If you grant my wish, I will release you.

88
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,740
Am I a hostage? I should be the one saying that.

89
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,820
Where do you eat? Where do you sleep?

90
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,910
Where is my room? Where do I need to sleep?

91
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:18,460
I don't eat, I don't sleep, and there's no room for you. Sleeping...

92
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,180
Well, you can sleep anywhere, around that area.

93
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,670
You have that many rooms!

94
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,930
Even if there are that many rooms, there's no room for you.

95
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,630
Excuse me.

96
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,970
- Hey! 
 - I told you there isn't a room for you.

97
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,130
  Noona!

98
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,150
What is this? Where is this sound coming from?

99
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,770
The dog appeared in front of the house.

100
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,130
A dog?

101
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,270
The dog!

102
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,120
Actually, he does seem like a dog.

103
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,620
  Noona! Hey! Tak Dong Kyeong!

104
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,610
Tak Seon Kyeong?

105
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,310
- How did he come here? 
 - He probably came to your house.

106
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,640
What are you saying?

107
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,580
You'll know what I'm talking about when you go out.

108
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:52,440
Dang, his abilities, seriously!

109
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,530
  Oh, Seon Kyeong, have you been doing well? Did you eat?

110
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:59,610
Yea, Aunt! What happened today was that Noona–

111
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,220
If you say some nonsense, I'm not giving you an allowance.

112
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,910
She's treating me so well!

113
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:07,130
Seriously, so well, and I'm so happy,

114
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,120
and I can't live without Noona!

115
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,200
Miss Soo Ja, looking at you basked in natural light in a foreign country, you look even more beautiful!

116
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,460
Well, whatever it is, I'm sure Seon Kyeong, you are in the wrong.

117
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,990
  What do you mean I'm in the wrong?

118
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,530
- Aunt, you only stick up to Noona– 
  - I sent money!

119
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,550
Aunt, I love you! I will fulfill filial deeds for you.

120
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:27,870
The man who only lives to fulfill filial deeds, my name Tak Seon Kyeong.

121
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,670
  You bastard. Do that for your sister, since I sent it to your sister's bank account.

122
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:36,370
What? Why? This is clear discrimination!

123
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:40,550
Why did you send money? I earn money too, you know.

124
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,790
I have to send money to act like an adult. I can nag, too.

125
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,110
If Seon Kyeong does something stupid, you keep all the money.

126
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,260
Aunt, Tak Dong Kyeong is a total Scrooge!

127
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,470
If you give money to her, she'll never give it back!

128
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,850
What'd you say? Scrooge?

129
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,620
 You know words like that?

130
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,010
  Guess it was worth it, sending you to college.

131
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:58,250
You guys haven't grown up at all.

132
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,820
Aunt, he's already served in the military. His skin is so tan now!

133
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,570
No, Aunt, I still have lighter skin than Tak Dong Kyeong.

134
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,420
This is just a tan!

135
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,110
Looking at what you're doing, I can see that Dong Kyeong isn't going to give you any money.

136
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,670
It's time to sleep in Korea, right?

137
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,830
Okay, my cuties, stop fighting. Sleep well, okay?

138
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,160
 Okay, Aunt!

139
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,490
Don't worry!

140
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,820
- Let's call again! 
 - Aunt, wait a moment–

141
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,910

142
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,120
- What? Why? 
 - "What, why?"

143
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,650
Wow. You're so shameless.

144
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,440
You're seriously–

145
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,950
What? You?

146
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,640
You, seriously, to your sister.

147
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,640
Hey, you should've used that physical force on that bastard.

148
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,300
Why are you trying to hit your own family?

149
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,920
What did you do to him?

150
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,530
Did you beat him up?

151
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,050
Are you worried about a married man right now?

152
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,050
I'm worried about you!

153
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,600
I'm worried that you're going to get a criminal history after beating up that useless bastard!

154
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,020
Don't worry! I took care of it well.

155
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,290
The sky helped.

156
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,520
  - Hey! 
 - Anyone!

157
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,600
 - Stop right there! 
 - Help me!

158
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,920
  Oh, oh, oh, oh!

159
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,590
 Is this 911? I'm calling about a car accident.

160
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:28,820
He's not dead. His reaction speed was nearly like Faker's. 
 (T/N: Lee Sang Hyeok, better known as Faker, is a South Korean professional League of Legends player for T1.)

161
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,960
It means he was hella fast.

162
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,110
But I think he'll be hospitalized for at least 8 weeks.

163
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,000
I took care of one bastard.

164
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,060
Where's the other one?

165
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,000
Why aren't you asking me?

166
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,720
Why aren't you asking why I was seeing a married man?

167
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,260
Why do I need to ask? It's obvious.

168
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,520
How can you win over a guy who is intentionally deceiving you?

169
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,320
Was he nice to you?

170
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,300
You're weak to someone who is nice.

171
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,950
I told you that just because somebody is nice to you doesn't mean they're a nice person!

172
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:08,200
You fool. Get out of the way! Where did you hide the other bastard?

173
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,310
You hid him inside your house, right?

174
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,820
Hey, Tak Seon Kyeong!

175
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,680
Hey, wait a moment–

176
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,710
Hey, wait a moment. W-Wait.

177
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:19,090
Not a moment, but tell me now. Where is he? Tell me right now.

178
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,610
- No, no. He's not here. 
 - What do you mean he's not here–

179
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,210
He's not here, right! He's not!

180
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,300
I told you he's not here! Let's go out right now.

181
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,990
- Let go, seriously! 
 - I told you he's not here!

182
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,480
- Hello, Brother-in-Law! 
 - Who are you calling brother-in-law?

183
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,030
You hid him so well. Lying in the middle of your bed.

184
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,630
I tried my best, but there was nowhere to hide.

185
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:47,530
How about you move to a bigger place, dear?

186
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,230
- Hey! 
 - Not hey, but "Dear."

187
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:57,680
- Dear? 
 - No, that's not it.

188
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,660
Dear...

189
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,460
That's not it...

190
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:13,560
So to get this straight, that was the plan? Talking about living together and whatnot?

191
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,990
Yes, that's what I'm saying. To get rid of that bastard.

192
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,330
Noona, stay out of this.

193
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,670
  He is strangely relaxed.

194
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,190
 Usually, that means he has money.

195
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,750
  He's smiling?

196
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,520
Let's have a drink.

197
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,680
Drink? What are you saying all of a sudden?

198
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,650
Noona, stay out of it!

199
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:44,860
You can only find out the full worth of a man if you feed him alcohol.

200
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,960
- Do you have money to buy drinks? 
 - So that's what I'm saying...

201
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,840
Noona, can you lend me around $10?

202
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,550
  His face is too unrealistic.

203
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:00,220
  He has money and face. Why would he be into my sister, who has nothing–

204
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,120
- I agree with you. 
 - What?

205
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,190
Let's have a drink together.

206
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:18,490
Our sister thinks that I live with no thoughts.

207
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,890
That's true.

208
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:24,460
Seriously, I'm feeling so frustrated!

209
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,900
 I am someone with plans and thoughts.

210
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,090
That's right, you have plans and thoughts.

211
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:37,370
Yes! That's right!

212
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,700
  She seriously doesn't know anything.

213
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,000
 She will find out all from tomorrow.

214
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,590
When you are about to do something, people always ask when and how, and that ruins your mood.

215
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:52,720
Wow, are you some kind of fortune teller?

216
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,730
You are so good at reading people!

217
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,990
 Who will understand me?

218
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:05,760
 Even if I'm lonely and having a hard time, I put on a brave face and live.

219
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,420
If you are lonely, act like you are;

220
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,250
and if you're having a hard time, make that obvious.

221
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,070
Don't put on such a brave face.

222
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,020
Okay. You pass!

223
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,970
What, pass?

224
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,480
Take care of my sister!

225
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,690
Hey, what are you to ask him to take care of me?

226
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,890
- Please take care of me, Brother-in-Law! 
 - Hey!

227
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,360
It's already this late! I should go now.

228
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,860
All of a sudden? It's late, just sleepover.

229
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,130
No, Noona! I'm not completely tactless, you know.

230
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,690
What tact? Do you want to be hit in your eye socket?

231
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,490
Have fun for a while longer, Brother-in-Law!

232
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,600
Hey! Are you seriously leaving? Tak Seon Kyeong!

233
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,000
- Hey! 
 - Yes!

234
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,960
- I'll say goodbye from my spot here! 
  - All right!

235
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,430
Cheers!

236
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:16,370
Why would I not know that he's lonely and having a hard time?

237
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,900
You're like that, too. Even if you hear it all, why do you listen to it?

238
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,160
That's seriously no manners.

239
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,710
I just hear it, so what do you want me to do?

240
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,500
You should at least try to put in an effort to not listen.

241
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,770
You act like an American, but your manners—

242
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,960
Whoa...

243
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,230
Wow!

244
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,160
Hey!

245
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,110
What? I can't smoke inside my own house?

246
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:20,770
That's what I'm saying! This is my house, but how is that your house?

247
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:25,310
Those kinds of situations can happen again, and I need to smoke,

248
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,640
and I don't like that you like my house.

249
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Fine. So you're going to come out like that, huh?

250
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,860
This is nice! It feels like my house has gotten much larger!

251
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,700
If he was going to do that, he shouldn't have said to live together.

252
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,600
You were the one who asked me to live together.

253
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,260
It's him, right? The person you love the most.

254
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,700
It's not him.

255
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,610
It's not him, I said!

256
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,970
Don't you dare do something to him!

257
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:15,100
It's not my job to think about what to do to him. That's your job.

258
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:23,370
I got it. So you're going to come at me like that, right?

259
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,410
Why are you putting your blankets over there?

260
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,440
I'm scared you're going to do something to my house while I'm sleeping.

261
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,550
If you want me to, I will try.

262
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,950
I'm a light sleeper.

263
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,840
Is this the time to brag?

264
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,440
- I can kill a human. 
 - That's enough. Just sleep.

265
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,780
I told you earlier, I don't eat or sleep, since I'm not a human.

266
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,690
- You ate cake! 
 - I was just going along with the atmosphere.

267
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,690
Oh, is that so?

268
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:10,040
Then go along with the atmosphere and turn off the light.

269
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,550
I have to read the book, so.

270
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,070
Do you think that the world must come to an end?

271
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,810
Not really.

272
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,950
Then, why are you doing all of this?

273
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,950
It's not like the world needs to keep existing.

274
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:52,490
Beings like you seem to pity humans.

275
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,210
Especially people like me.

276
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,100
You sound like you're close to someone like that.

277
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,400
It's usually like that in the fantasy dramas and movies I've watched.

278
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,850
Humans all have a time limit anyways.

279
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:06,710
They only live forever until they realize that

280
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:10,160
they're all trivial, they're all the same.

281
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,440
Since they're all the same, there's no reason to particularly pity one over the other.

282
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:19,560
You pity with your heart, it's not like a job to do.

283
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,200
I'm not human, so I don't have a heart.

284
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,880
Lies.

285
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,070
You were the one who said that you were thinking

286
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,240
the same thing at the same time as me.

287
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,720
 All right, Dong Kyeong.

288
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,040
 Mine's bigger!

289
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,920
 Let's go ride the ferris wheel!

290
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,880
 Let's go!

291
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:03,910
 Seong Kyeong! Come and eat some watermelon!

292
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,320
 Happy birthday, Dong Kyeong!

293
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,190
Did you sleep well?

294
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:38,080
You must have had a good dream.

295
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,810
Were you in my dream?

296
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:46,870
Me? No.

297
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:49,280
I'm just in your house.

298
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,700
What are you doing?

299
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,280
Fear mongering.

300
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,400
Get out!

301
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,750
So, let's get things straight.

302
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,890
The terms of the contract are...

303
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,820
Before I die, I need to

304
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:29,100
wish for doom upon the world.

305
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,910
During the contract period of 100 days,

306
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,020
I will not be in pain.

307
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:38,230
It's like Cinderella. Before midnight, you need to recharge.

308
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,680
Before I die, besides wishing for doom on the world,

309
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,920
one of my wishes will come true.

310
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,790
I regret it these days.

311
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,840
Only if I hadn't said that, things would be easier.

312
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,730
If the contract is broken,

313
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,020
the person I love the most

314
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:09,230
at that very moment will die.

315
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:12,890
Why are you such a pessimist? You get to live instead.

316
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,300
Hold on.

317
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,990
Then, either way, they'll die.

318
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:19,990
If I break the contract, they die. If I follow the contract, they die.

319
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,290
Who? Tak Seon Kyeong?

320
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:25,560
All right. Then let's just kill him. That sounds good, too.

321
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:33,910
You weren't even thinking of him when you were wishing for doom.

322
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,030
Well, because I wasn't being sincere.

323
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,250
You were.

324
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,880
If you weren't, I wouldn't have heard it.

325
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,960
Goodbye!

326
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:07,000
Have a good day! This is the first of the days you have left.

327
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,960

328
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,560

329
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,250

330
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,020

331
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,190

332
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,810
Wow, Writer Kwi Gong Ja, as always.

333
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:13,120
As soon as an update is up, the views are at 2,000.

334
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,930
Chapter 94 is probably really fun to read, right?

335
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:17,390
You don't even have to ask.

336
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,010
Writer Ji Jo King said no to editing.

337
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,380
Guess there's no use even if the editor is pretty, huh?

338
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,360
I guess I'm not that pretty.

339
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,890
What do you mean? You're pretty enough.

340
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,940
Yeah, this prettiness is not for you.

341
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,560
What about the contract for Writer Siberia?

342
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:41,830
Oh, he was here a few days ago to talk with Manager Tak.

343
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:44,860
Oh, he already has 2 ongoing works right now,

344
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,770
so it might be too much to add a third one.

345
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,360
We agreed to continue with the contract after he finishes one of those.

346
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,980
- How's his work progress going? 
 - He's usually not slow.

347
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,460
He's been hard to contact these days, but we have enough content saved up.

348
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,050
We're just keeping an eye out for now.

349
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,410
Yeah?

350
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,280
I'll call him sometime soon to say hi.

351
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,550
Would you look at the confidence of a pretty person?

352
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:05,240
He's so confident that his call will be picked up.

353
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,680
- Let's finish the meeting. 
 - Thank you for your hard work.

354
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,190
  Hey, the heater is on at your home.

355
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,760
 What was that just now?

356
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,430
Didn't that just type out by itself?

357
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:21,710
What do you mean! Wasn't the meeting so long today?

358
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,330
It was too long... too long.

359
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:26,220
Today's been so tiring. Yeah?

360
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,220

361
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,860
 I don't expect too much. Just $300.

362
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,770
Depends. We'll see how you do.

363
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:35,830

364
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,990
 Then, just $200.

365
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:40,280
 I think the gas bill might come out to be a lot.

366
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,230
Gosh, are you kidding me?

367
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:45,280
 Then just $50.

368
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,000
- Oh! 
 - Hey!

369
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,500
I show up to work so I can eat.

370
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,680
I have to cure my hangover. Spicy seafood noodle soup for me.

371
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,400
What should I eat today...

372
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,850
  I was going to turn it off so I clicked some buttons, but the numbers on the screen keep going up.

373
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:08,520
  I just don't know how to work these.

374
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,980
- How much time is left for our lunch break? 
- Why?

375
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,090
40 minutes?

376
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:20,270
- Sorry. You two eat. 
  - Hey! Where are you going?

377
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,050
Hey!

378
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:40,130
 I think I figured it out. You should be grateful to me.

379
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,920
Geez, really?

380
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:53,810
Yes, Team Leader? Oh, I'll be right on my way.

381
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,970
  Yeah, come right away to the funeral hall.

382
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,360
Excuse me?

383
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:04,090
Sorry, I had an urgent phone call.

384
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,350
What's more urgent than this right now?

385
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,930
My ranking went down!

386
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,550
Oh, it has.

387
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,110
Who was it? Shanghai Park?

388
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,980
I've never heard of them. How could they surpass me?

389
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,580
It's just a competitive world.

390
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,830
Um...

391
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:25,510
I heard that the writers you're in charge of, always place in the top 10 rankings.

392
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,590
Is there a secret to it?

393
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:32,160
I'm not sure. The writers just work really hard.

394
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,780
Oh, don't be like that, it's upsetting.

395
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:42,000
I will let you know if you pay.

396
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,420
You are going too far with a joke.

397
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,640
It's not a joke though.

398
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,180
Would you like to enter into a contract with me?

399
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,080
Separately, one to one.

400
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,580
You agree to everything I say and submit to it.

401
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,430
Pay an incentive if you get in the top 10.

402
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,120
For real?

403
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:07,060
It's a joke, of course.

404
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,580
A reunion?  Why suddenly a reunion?

405
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,180
 What do you mean "suddenly"?

406
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,020
 Except for you, we've been having it for nine years.

407
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,970
 The kids are going nuts saying that they want to see you.

408
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,950
Tell them that I haven't returned from Japan yet.

409
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,210
 Does that even make sense?

410
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,720
 You were... what was that... "Swimsuit Prince"?

411
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,140
It's all memories.

412
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,840
 The girls would call you "Swimsuit Prince" and...

413
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,320
 They used to make a fuss saying that "He always smells of soap," or whatever, remember?

414
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:34,010
 It was really something when Na Ji Na made a banner with that phrase.

415
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,750
Who are all coming?

416
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,170
 Da Young, Eun Bi, Jung Hwa...

417
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:41,190
 Hey, Na Ji Na is coming, too.

418
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,030
 Really?  Na Ji Na is coming, too?

419
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,160
Hey, I am busy.  I am hanging up.

420
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,420
 Are you coming or not?  Just tell me that.

421
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,670
Okay, I will go.  I will go.

422
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:55,240
 - You have to come for sure, okay?  
 - Okay.

423
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,870
Would you like to order?

424
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:07,090
It's Glioblastoma multiforme.  It looks to be multiple tumors.

425
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,440
We would need to do a biopsy for more details.

426
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,590
I will do it.  I will do anything.  Please save me.

427
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:19,220
You can live for about one year if you have the surgery, three months if you don't.

428
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:23,660
Even with the surgery, there may be hemiplegia, language impairment, cognitive impairment.

429
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,080
I will do the surgery.  I will do it right away.

430
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,870
Please save me. Please save me, Doctor.

431
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:38,990
That's right.  This is normal.

432
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:46,740
It's right that you hang onto me, right?

433
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,340
She's really strange.

434
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,110
Excuse me?

435
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:06,090
What is this?  Why am I crying?

436
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:08,960
Well, perhaps because you got lost?

437
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,510
The ENT department is to the right when you go out.

438
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,590
Thank you.

439
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,890
She's out, the patient in room 302.

440
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:58,320
Grandfather liked it, because I am a writer.

441
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,960
He used to always ask what I was writing but I couldn't tell him.

442
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,860
Because I was embarrassed.

443
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,860
Your grandfather probably would have liked them as well.

444
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:15,080
Because I like them, too.  Your work.

445
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,610
Excuse me?

446
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:19,980
"I Never Thought of You As a Friend"?

447
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,530
Grandfather would?

448
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:29,460
No. "I, the Conqueror of Devildom, Am an Ordinary Employee?" that one.

449
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:34,790
Actually, I prefer "I Cry Out Love From Apocalypse."

450
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,940
 I love you!

451
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:45,000
So, that's your problem, Mr. Writer.

452
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,250
The genre you like and the genre you are good at, are different.

453
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:56,960
I am sorry.  I don't think it is something I should be saying at a place like this.

454
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,000
No, it's about work anyway.

455
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,540
I wasn't able to attend the last meeting either.

456
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:06,680
 That kid, Siberia, is wandering around for a bit because he needs some time.

457
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:12,070
By chance, did you wander around somewhere that time or...

458
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:16,160
I almost lost consciousness.  I slept so much.

459
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,000
When I woke up, a whole day had passed.

460
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,680
Sleep, huh?

461
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,370
Thank you for coming.  You must be having a hard time because of me.

462
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:30,520
- I am always causing trouble for you. 
 - No, it's no trouble.

463
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,510
For a while, please don't worry about the series.

464
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,790
We will take care of it.

465
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:37,180
You just take care and get yourself together.

466
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,980
Thank you.

467
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,020
Sure.

468
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,300

469
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,830
Ah, I am sor...

470
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:51,490
Unni, which bus do I need to take if I want to go to Myeongdong?

471
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:54,790
Uh, this one.

472
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:58,020
Uh, you have to take this one.  It's leaving.

473
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,290
Ah, I need to take that one, I see.

474
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,030
Unni, this bracelet is pretty.  Where did you buy it?

475
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,580
Tak Dong Kyeong!

476
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:25,490
Uh? Hey, how did you know that I was here?

477
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,710
I had something to ask you anyway.

478
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,340
Let's go.  Let's go and talk.

479
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,540
Hey, no—

480
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,860
I said let's go home and talk.

481
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,310
What is wrong with you?

482
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,300
I've seen you before.

483
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,660
What?

484
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:46,910
I saw you.  In the past, at a funeral hall.

485
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,940
You were crying, right?

486
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,440
I remember now.

487
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,180
You said you don't eat or sleep, or have emotions.

488
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:32,300
You said you don't have any reason to feel sad for anyone.  A total lie.

489
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,110
And you cried so much like that?

490
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:38,050
What are you saying?  It wasn't me.

491
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:43,500
Adults cry, too, I see.

492
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,640
The bus is here.

493
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,910
Yes, it was you.

494
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,320
No, it wasn't me.

495
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,230
It was you.

496
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:23,000
Hey, you said you don't sleep.

497
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,260
Why pretend to sleep all of a sudden?

498
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,400
Okay, let's say you are sleeping.

499
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,540
But why sleep there of all places when there are so many rooms?

500
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,980
Because something might happen to you.

501
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,590
Because something might happen to me?

502
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:37,610
Not because you are worried that I might do something to your house?

503
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,840
Hey, quit your work.

504
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,960
Suddenly?

505
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,540
Quit your work and just stay home.

506
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:49,520
Even if I don't have many days to live, I still have to eat.

507
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:54,610
House payment, food bills, and the gas bill.

508
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:56,740
What am I supposed to do with miscellaneous expenses?

509
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,510
Make a wish, for money.  I will give you as much as you want.

510
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,990
I can't do that.  I don't want to use up my wish for something like that.

511
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,120
Don't you think that you are letting your guard down a little too much?

512
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,960
Don't show that bracelet to just anyone.

513
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,690
It can become your weakness.

514
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:13,830
Why are you like this since earlier?

515
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:18,080
By chance, do you like me?

516
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,420
If not, it's not, but why do you answer me like that with your eyes, embarrassing me?

517
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:28,130
Since I am not human, I don't know what it's like for a human to feel embarrassed.

518
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,060
You... are really strange right now.  You know that, right?

519
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,030
I don't care if anything happens.

520
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:40,350
I clearly told you.

521
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,680
Ah, so scary.  You are so scary that I am about to cry.

522
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,700
No, it's not.

523
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,350
But when you are not even human,

524
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:56,670
why get so huffy when I talk to you about you crying?

525
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:59,240
Getting huffy is an emotion, too.

526
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:05,090
Oh, it's almost 12:00! Hand!

527
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,340
But do you not remember me?

528
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:20,240
We were right across from each other.

529
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,550
My face stayed the same while I grew up prettily.

530
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:35,080
You're asleep. You said you don't eat or sleep, or have emotions, but look at you asleep.

531
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,000
I'm not sleeping.

532
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,820
I haven't for a second while you were asleep.

533
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:00,990
That means I'm always awake while you're defenseless.

534
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:03,490
It's dangerous on many levels.

535
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:19,330
But... why did you cry that day?

536
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:22,220
Who did you lose?

537
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,050
My mother.

538
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,860
- Mother? 
 - To put it roughly.

539
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,780
Something like that.

540
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,490
So you did cry.

541
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,980
I didn't!

542
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:03,510
Were you sad because I died?

543
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:06,770
Is it your habit nowadays to suddenly appear?

544
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:10,630
You acted so cold, but you know how to cry.

545
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,990
Why did you approach her?

546
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,050
I told you that I will try anything.

547
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:19,030
Let her be. She will die soon anyway.

548
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,820
That's something I should be saying.

549
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,380
I won't harm her at least.

550
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,480
You must've gotten close with her.

551
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,960
We got close enough.

552
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:35,510
That's good. Isn't it the first time a human remembered you?

553
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:37,410
Well,

554
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:42,330
you were crying that much, so who wouldn't remember you?

555
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,910
It's not that–

556
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:47,730
Oh, they're doing rounds.  Gotta go!

557
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:51,590
Oh, don't cry when I'm not here.

558
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:55,290
Hey! Hey!

559
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:03,290
Seriously, Tak Dong Kyeong...

560
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:06,090
Your blood pressure and pulse look good today.

561
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:08,400
Your condition has improved greatly recently.

562
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,640
If this trend continues, you can be discharged soon.

563
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,220
Really?

564
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,370
Lies...

565
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:42,310
Your condition also improved greatly.

566
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:45,910
If things keep going like this, you will bloom flowers soon.

567
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:54,580
What... is this?

568
00:44:54,580 --> 00:45:01,430
The writer that was hired recently is older and only prefers to handwrite on paper.

569
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:04,920
- But what? 
 - You're in charge.

570
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,860
- Under whose decision? 
 - According to the CEO.

571
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:12,080
- The CEO came? 
 - He came, sadly.

572
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:18,040
But I don't know if it's been a while since I saw him, but he feels a bit different.

573
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:31,080
That... is our CEO? That?

574
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,390
I don't think he looks that different.

575
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:39,320
Seriously, I'm about to go crazy.

576
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:00,860
- Are you crazy? 
 - No, I'm sane.

577
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,560
Is it because I made fun of you for crying?

578
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,160
- No way. 
 - That must be it.

579
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,260
I just thought you liked living with me, so I thought you would also like working with me.

580
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:10,900
Are you seriously going to be like this at somebody else's company?

581
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,790
Do you think a company is where you fool around?

582
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:15,700
What do you mean somebody else's company? I'm the CEO.

583
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:20,700
Seriously, come over here!

584
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,740
CEO, the date for the web novels conference was finalized.

585
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:30,330
Were you guys discussing something important?

586
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:34,750
Yes. Discussing something very important.

587
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:39,040
Well then, continue on.

588
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,460
Manager Tak, isn't it time to go to the meeting with Writer Lee Hyeon?

589
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,820
Team Leader, you go.

590
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:48,150
What?

591
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:54,220
As you can see, I'm very busy so you should go instead.

592
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:58,320
Oh, okay.

593
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,010
She's acting weird. She changed.

594
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,920
- Do you like him? 
 - What? Him?

595
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,320
Does he like me?

596
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,680
No. If you like him, give up.

597
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,330
He was cussing you out on the inside. At least I do it out loud.

598
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:28,270
Seriously, you...

599
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:35,930
 You're coming to the reunion, right?  Hyeon Kyu is coming.

600
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:54,490
If you're going to win a medal, make it gold.

601
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:58,820
  Hyeon Kyu went to study abroad to swim,

602
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:03,770
 but nothing seemed to have worked out, and I heard he came back to Korea and opened a cafe.

603
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:07,060
No way it's here, right?

604
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:18,330

605
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:21,120
This is so disgustingly boring.

606
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,760
Team Leader Cha Joo Ik?

607
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:46,090
Manager Tak was busy with work.

608
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:48,660
I needed to get a message across about your last finished work.

609
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:51,400
And feedback for your new work, as well.

610
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,530
Let's start with your new work.

611
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:57,800
- Wow, okay. 
 - Writer,

612
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:01,230
I don't know how to word this, but...

613
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,520
It's fine. Just talk comfortably.

614
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,400
Got it. Even if it's uncomfortable, I have to tell you since that's my job.

615
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,860
Oh, I see...

616
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:16,660
Writer, do you think a male lead who just runs away every time an incident occurs is charming?

617
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:20,960
- What? 
 - In all of your work, the male leads show this same pattern.

618
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,410
When the girl confesses her feelings, he runs away and rejects her.

619
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:24,850
When something happens, he disappears by himself.

620
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:26,720
There has to be a conflict for the main couple to stick together.

621
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,380
That's why I'm asking if that conflict is charming or not.

622
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,500
I'm writing like that because I think it is charming.

623
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,850
- Writer Lee Hyeon. 
 - Yes.

624
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:41,800
So your real name beside your pen name,

625
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,360
is Na... Ji Na.

626
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,860
Yes, it's Na Ji Na.

627
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:49,370
Is Lee Hyeon named after him? Lee Hyeon Kyu?

628
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,260
So I'm right.

629
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:59,480
That's why you're like this, huh?

630
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:01,640
Because he's the model.

631
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:16,400
Can you be like this?

632
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,520
If you're in the CEO's office for too long, people will misunderstand.

633
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:22,290
Let them misunderstand. If I die, it's all over anyway.

634
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:23,850
Flip the page.

635
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:28,250
That's what I'm saying. It's all over when you die,

636
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:31,230
so why are you working so hard?

637
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:36,330
It's something the CEO told me to do, so I need to work hard.

638
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:39,380
Let's suffer together since we're in the same boat.

639
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:42,090
Who said that we're in the same boat?

640
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:46,450
If we thought the same thing at the same time, it's pretty much decided...

641
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,390
I'm not going to do it.

642
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,080
Can't you just be compliant?

643
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,420
If you just say, pretend it didn't happen, it'll all be over.

644
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:00,490
Why don't you know how to cling on to someone?

645
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:01,840
Then, are you going to do all this?

646
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,940
I can't type.

647
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:05,810
I can't eat, sleep, cry, type–

648
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:09,000
Then, how did you type in my laptop?

649
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,400
To put it clearly, that was more like showing you, not typing.

650
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,740
If only you couldn't talk.

651
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:18,900
Then, does that mean you can't eat, sleep, or talk? Since you can cry?

652
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,200
Memories, you know, can be easily manipulated.

653
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,480
That's what I'm saying.

654
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,880
How did I forget that?

655
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,020
It's not like your face is common, you know.

656
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,040
That's true.

657
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,660
It's very common. These kinds of faces are super common.

658
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:39,430
This is so cool. I couldn't remember at all,

659
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:43,720
and somebody brushed past me and my memories came crashing down.

660
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:47,020
What?

661
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:51,260
I was standing there. At the funeral home.

662
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,770
Who suddenly hit me–

663
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:57,590
  I'm sorry.  Oh?

664
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,280
It's her.

665
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:04,260
  The girl from the bus stop!

666
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:07,970
  So I must do anything.

667
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:11,060
  I told you I'll try to do anything.

668
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:19,920
Hey, where are you going?

669
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,250
Hey! Hey!

670
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:44,980
That something you were planning was this?

671
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:49,490
- You came. 
 - That something you were planning was this?

672
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:51,190
What did I do?

673
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:54,540
I just made her forget what happened,

674
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,890
but you were the one who got close to her.

675
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:01,430
Do you now realize what it means to feel sympathy?

676
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:02,430
I don't know that.

677
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:06,790
You do know. You just decided not to.

678
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:10,060
You smile frequently and you pity her, right?

679
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:11,550
It'll get worse from here.

680
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:12,630
Never.

681
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:14,150
Can you just let her die?

682
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:17,250
She was destined to die from the beginning.

683
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:22,360
Can't you change her fate?

684
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:26,010
Who do I worry about?

685
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,240
Who do I pity?

686
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:31,410
You always think you're the most pathetic and pitiful, right?

687
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:35,930
Do you know? What sympathy is?

688
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:42,320
I'll find the person who will die in her place after you break the contract pitifully.

689
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:17,400
Because of you, I can't live my full life.

690
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,330
How can you just run away after stirring things up?

691
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:23,240
Where are these keys?

692
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,480
I need to change to a door lock or something.

693
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,990
I had to work overtime because of you today!

694
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:38,500
Why do you keep looking at me?

695
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:43,100
You said you remember me, right?

696
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,230
What? Yeah.

697
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:48,120
I also remember you.

698
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:10,920
  Everyone was crying, but a little girl was smiling.

699
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:15,280
So I remember. Because it was sad.

700
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,380
It was sad?

701
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:24,730
I don't know from when and how this was all planned.

702
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:26,150
What are you suddenly saying—

703
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:28,470
But it all doesn't matter.

704
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,820
I don't plan on making you smile.

705
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,560
Hey, why are you suddenly like this?

706
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,560
Is it because I made fun of you for crying?

707
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,100
If you were offended, I'm sorry.

708
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:46,210
It's 12:00 soon.

709
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:49,940
But I won't grab your hand.

710
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,710
What are you saying...?

711
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:01,720
I was too kind to you for no reason.

712
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:23,960
H-Hand... Give me your hand...

713
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,160
Is that your wish?

714
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,310
H-Hand! Give me your hand!

715
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:29,820
I'm asking you if that's your wish.

716
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:44,360
Please...

717
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,220
Wish.

718
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:26,270
I told you not to put your guard down.

719
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:29,320
That bracelet can become your weakness.

720
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:33,160
I'm not a human.

721
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,440
I don't eat, sleep, or cry.

722
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,770
I don't feel sympathy or love. I don't have those emotions.

723
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:42,960
I... decided to do that a long time ago.

724
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:50,120
You're pitiful.

725
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,670
You're the one who is pitiful.

726
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:55,030
You will end up crying because of me.

727
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:57,910
You will want to bring doom upon the world.

728
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:00,630
Since that's the only way you can kill me.

729
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:16,300
That's your plan?

730
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:29,990
Then this is my plan.

731
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:45,830
♫  It's about to fall off, it's dangerous  ♫

732
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:51,850
♫  I’m sorry I'm tearing up Yeah  ♫

733
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,240
Are you crazy?

734
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,690
I knew you would do this.

735
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:00,840
I knew you would hold onto me.

736
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,840
You were caught by me.

737
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:08,030
You said you don't eat, sleep, cry, or feel sympathy and love?

738
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:11,090
Because you're not a human?

739
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:12,650
I can.

740
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:15,090
Since I'm a human.

741
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:17,280
So I'm saying...

742
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,390
♫  My last favor  ♫

743
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:23,020
♫  I'm breaking down  ♫

744
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:24,920
I plan on loving you.

745
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:29,870
♫  Falling apart  ♫

746
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:31,670

747
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:35,720
Then without losing anything,

748
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,940
I can live.

749
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:44,030
♫  Living in the consciousness  ♫

750
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:48,280

752
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:05,300
Then let's do it properly.

753
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:11,860
Until you want to bring doom upon the world for me.

754

760
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:51,480
  Everyone either resents me or wants me. They don't love me.

761
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:54,140
  I will. I have to.

762
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:55,290
  Don't regret it.

763
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:56,430
  I don't remember.

764
01:00:56,430 --> 01:00:59,270
 Why can't you forget something like this and cry about it?

765
01:00:59,270 --> 01:01:02,370
 You are signing a contract with me, 1:1.

766
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:05,790
 If he appears in your dream, it's game over.

767
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:07,840
 What will happen if I kill him right now?

768
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:10,590
 Die!

769
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:11,650
  Tak Seon Kyeong!

770
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:15,110
 If I can't kill you, I will bring you misery.

771
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:18,790
 I told you that you won't be able to love me.
