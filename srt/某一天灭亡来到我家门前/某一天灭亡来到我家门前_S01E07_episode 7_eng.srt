00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,370

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,170

3
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:28,210

4
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:33,580

5
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,810

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,000

7
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:59,120

8
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,080

9
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,940
I have a wish.

10
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,940
I want you...

11
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,040
to love me.

12
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,510
Can I make that...

13
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,080
my wish?

14
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,220
No.

15
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:34,310
♫  I stand alone again at that same spot  ♫

16
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:42,310
♫  Here with me, even today  ♫

17
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,490
♫   I still believe   ♫

18
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,170
♫  Now it's all for you  ♫

19
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:02,040
♫  While standing in the deep place of my memories  ♫

20
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:09,130
♫  I hear a low sound, it's you  ♫

21
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:15,390
♫  It's you who held onto me  ♫

22
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,210
Why...?

23
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,060
♫   I wanna be with you  ♫

24
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,700
♫  At the end of a tiring day  ♫

25
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,720
♫  Without a sound, come to me  ♫

26
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,850
♫  And hug me  ♫

27
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:48,080
♫  Wait for me at the end of this road  ♫

28
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,300

29
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,850
♫  My feelings for you are unstoppable  ♫

30
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:02,810
♫   I wanna be with you   ♫

31
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,290
♫  Now at least you know a little bit  ♫

32
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,480
♫  What I feel for you  ♫

33
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:17,980
♫  I pray that you'll also look at the same place as me  ♫

34
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,230
♫   I wanna be with you   ♫

35
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,230
♫  My long day shines because of you  ♫

36
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,160
♫  My long day shines because of you  ♫

37
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,260
♫  Just you alone  ♫

38
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:40,750
♫  Beyond this deepening sadness  ♫

39
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:46,270
♫  Again today, I only picture you  ♫

40
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:51,330
♫   I wanna be with you   ♫ 
   Manager Tak.

41
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,080
 Manager Tak?

42
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,440
- Manager Tak. 
 - Yes?

43
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,030
- The CEO is calling for you. 
 - All right.

44
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,670
What? The CEO? Which CEO?

45
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,430
Is there any other than our Park CEO?

46
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,750
Oh, you went out for work earlier, right?

47
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,410
He came to work during that time.

48
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,420
But is it because we haven't seen him in so long? He looks so different.

49
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,000
What's up with her?

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,420
Should I have set her up on a blind date?

51
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,250
Hey!

52
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,350
Hey?

53
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:36,450
Yahoo! You're back! I feel so assured now.

54
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:40,850
Right? The company doesn't really work well without me, right?

55
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,430
The spot as the CEO is really a big one.

56
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,170
- Oh, I heard you called for me. 
 - For you to set up a work dinner.

57
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,760
A work dinner? All of a sudden?

58
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,830
To celebrate my coming back. It's a comeback party!

59
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,980
Hey, the writers must've felt so anxious without me. Like you!

60
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,490
I want to see them, to make them feel better.

61
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,600
Ah. I see.

62
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,960
Just contact and bring anyone you can.

63
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,960

64
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,160
Oh, hey! Yes!

65
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,980
I was going to tell you!  Yes.

66
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,410
Yes, yes, yes.

67
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:18,200
Don't even talk about it.  I just got drained and came back, seriously.

68
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,250
 Why are women all like that?

69
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,570
I'm on a break right now. I have to go back to my dorm later.

70
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,620
I took precious time out of my day for this.

71
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,180
I see.

72
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,800
Why would you spend your precious time coming here, when you aren't going to finish your work?

73
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,230
Editor, are you upset?

74
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,690
It doesn't really matter if I'm upset or not.

75
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:57,120
If we don't work it out, we just fall apart. Then we become strangers.

76
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,150
But why is that stranger here?

77
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,640
That's what I'm curious about.

78
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,670
I'll keep writing.

79
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,790
- What? 
 - I'll keep writing.

80
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,830
There's not much left, so I'll just shorten it and finish it.

81
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,730
In return, don't spread a word about this.

82
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:21,010
I'm still acting the role of an innocent person who doesn't know how to use the internet.

83
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,060
Why are you bringing that up all of a sudden?

84
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,780
I keep having weird dreams.

85
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,110
- Dreams? 
 - Every day, a weird man appears in my dreams.

86
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,810
He tells me, "If you don't finish your work, you can't debut." He pushes me off cliffs.

87
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,600
He traps me in an elevator, then makes it drop.

88
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,160
Then he makes the plane I'm in, crash.

89
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,430
Mom tells me not to worry, saying the dreams are just signs that I'll be growing taller.

90
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,740
But it's not like that at all.

91
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,590
I always wake up because I'm so scared,

92
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,550
and I can't sleep again in case I have those dreams.

93
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,650
Since I can't dream, I can't even think of any of the lines.

94
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,020
I really think I'll be doomed.

95
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,340
Please let me finish my work.

96
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,880
Is this funny? This is so serious to me.

97
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,440
It's not funny. It's serious to me, too.

98
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,370
That man... the one in your dreams,

99
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,060
did he ever say anything?

100
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:18,120
He just... said, "Jerk." To himself.

101
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,940
Jerk.

102
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,210
What? Me?

103
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,560
No. The one in your dream.

104
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,100
The one who disappeared.

105
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,590
Where did he go?

106
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,150
Where on earth did he go?

107
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,760
 Where am I?

108
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,920

109
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,810
Sir! Wait a minute!

110
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:44,240
Sir! Sir! Please wait.

111
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,410
She can't see you.

112
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:55,360
This isn't real. It's fragments of the past that have been prepared for your education.

113
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,190
It's not real, but it is reality.

114
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,110
How is it? It's so realistic, right?

115
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,890
What is this?

116
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,830
Oh, I'm sorry. The tire blew out.

117
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,190
I think you'll have to get off.

118
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,800
- Please open the door, then! 
 - This is too much.

119
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,820
- Gosh! 
 - Just get the next bus.

120
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,360
This really won't do.

121
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,420
Excuse me! Excuse me.

122
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,820
Excuse me. #127.

123
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,950
Has #127's turn passed?

124
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,190
#127?

125
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,370
- Tak Dong Kyeong? 
 - Yes.

126
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,660
- Your turn was over long ago. 
 - What?

127
00:09:55,270 --> 00:10:01,090
#207, #208, #209. You may go in.

128
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:05,470
Excuse me, on my way here, the bus I was on got a flat tire.

129
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,450
I couldn't even get a taxi for a while, either.

130
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,990
A lot of things happened.

131
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,980
We have rules set in place. I apologize.

132
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,050
Excuse me. Can't something be done?

133
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,260
I'm sorry.

134
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,230

135
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,310
How pitiful... because of you.

136
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,050
What were you doing on this day?

137
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:02,600
That's right. The tire would have popped eventually as long as you existed.

138
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,600
It's just that it had to pop right at that moment.

139
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,050
 2012 math aptitude test.  Third period, foreign language.

140
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,650
 We will begin the lunch break.

141
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:28,990
 Students, please return back to your seats ten minutes before the exam starts.

142
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,460
 One more time, I'm making an announcement.

143
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:36,630
 2012 math aptitude test.  Third period,

144
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,310
 foreign language.  Lunch break...

145
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,950
What were you doing on this day? Well, I guess that isn't important.

146
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,170
The end of everything is connected to your existence.

147
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,700
No matter what you were doing, do you think it was just her lunchbox?

148
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,580
Because of you, many things must've occurred at every minute, every second.

149
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:13,950
But you know, right? That there is a reason why that must occur to every end.

150
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:19,410
It's not your fault. Your existence is essential to this world.

151
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,400
 Whenever I wanted to cry, I always sat here

152
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,290
  like this every day. Since I was young.

153
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,240
Hello?

154
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,520
 Are there any adults at home?

155
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,590
Mom and Dad said they'll be home soon. Who is this?

156
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,360
 This is Tak Jong Won and Kang Soo Ah's house, right?

157
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,050
 This is the hospital. There was an accident.

158
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,840
 Do you have any adult you can contact?

159
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:13,240
You are responsible for everything that disappears.

160
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,340
As you know.

161
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,900
Stop!

162
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,750
It seemed like you were lost and wandering about.

163
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:56,780
♫  It’s about to fall off, it's dangerous  ♫

164
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:03,960
♫  I’m sorry I'm tearing up, yeah  ♫

165
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,650
♫  The darkness falls down and disappears  ♫

166
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,130
- Are you done being angry? 
 - You...

167
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:16,020
Do you get a feel for it now? What you did to that child?

168
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,220
You want to disappear after receiving her love?

169
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:25,260
So you want to receive love...

170
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,730
from her, right?

171
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,280
You have big dreams.

172
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,090
I... I–

173
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:42,320
That day the tumor started to grow inside her brain,

174
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,890
you must've been doing something.

175
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,390
If you're done, leave.

176
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,500
I'm done saying everything I wanted to say.

177
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:55,040
♫  Living in the consciousness  ♫

178
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,050
♫  Inside my memory  ♫

179
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,520
 People who are nice to me always disappear.

180
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:26,230
 That was always the case. My life was always like that.

181
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,600
 As if everyone was warm to me for the sole purpose of disappearing.

182
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,190
 Why did you? Where did you go?

183
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,790
 What am I supposed to do? What should I do?

184
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:54,770
 Nothing. In the end, there's nothing I can do.

185
00:15:54,770 --> 00:16:01,470
 I now understand your lonesome face, looking over the things that will disappear.

186
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:06,560
 You had that kind of face because you knew you couldn't do anything.

187
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:12,930
♫  Inside my memory  ♫

188
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:47,440
♫  I’m breaking down, living in the consciousness  ♫

189
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,530
♫  Inside my memory  ♫

190
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:55,460
♫  Memory  ♫

191
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,290
Where were you?

192
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,720
Did you run away?

193
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,630
I was chased out.

194
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,830
Chased?

195
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:59,430
By who? Where were you chased out to?

196
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,830
From your life to your life.

197
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:06,220
- Explain so I understand. 
 - I can't explain for you to understand.

198
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,200
You wouldn't understand anyway.

199
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,970
Hey!

200
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:15,120
I should be the one who is angry, but why are you angry instead?

201
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,370
I'm not angry at you.

202
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:24,320
Then why? Why are you mad at yourself?

203
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:32,550
Because I forgot everything. I'm angry about that.

204
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,290
I seriously can't understand you.

205
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:39,470
You have no intention of telling me, right?

206
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,430
I got it. I got it, so go to your house for now.

207
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,900
- I'm going right now. 
 - No.

208
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,470
Not through my house's front door, but through your house's front door.

209
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,410
Your house must have a front door.

210
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,890
When you disappeared,

211
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,130
I didn't even have a place I could go to find you.

212
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,970
Tell me. Your house.

213
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:18,590
That way, even if you're chased out again, I have somewhere to go find you.

214
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,790
Wow...

215
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:44,160
So this was a real place?

216
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,800
This is the front of my house.

217
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,820
Your house is located in a more accessible place than I thought.

218
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,840
I think I can find it next time.

219
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,730
You won't be able to find it.

220
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:32,370
If I am chased out again, even if you come here, you won't be able to see me.

221
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,760
What happened? You need to tell me so I–

222
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,170
I made a misjudgment.

223
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:45,160
It was a wrong conclusion.

224
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,150
What do you mean by that?

225
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,190
What you said was right.

226
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,920
You shouldn't love me.

227
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,970
You can't love me.

228
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,510
So, your wish...

229
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,630
I can't fulfill it.

230
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,550
It's cold.  Let's go inside.  Let's talk inside.

231
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:14,230
Asking me to love you, that's not possible.

232
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,540
Let's stop.

233
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,260
I am saying let's stop.

234
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,800
Living together.

235
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,010
What are you doing, Boss?

236
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,620
I wasn't doing anything.

237
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,320
- Boss. 
 - Yeah?

238
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,470
Are you suffering from unrequited love?

239
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,760
No.

240
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,170
Not unrequited love.

241
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,670
- First love. 
 - What?

242
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:02,580
- At your age, first love? 
 - When was your first love?

243
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,980
For me, maybe around age 18?

244
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,300
I was crazy in love.

245
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,310
I only have half of my heart, you know.  Because I burned the other half then.

246
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,550
It was around then for me as well.

247
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:17,400
- But it's still ongoing? 
 - Yeah.

248
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,960
Because I ran into her again recently.

249
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,810
Awesome!  How?

250
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:23,230
No, that's not the important thing.

251
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,600
How did you break up?

252
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,660
How we broke up is more important than the fact that we ran into each other again?

253
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,710
Of course, it's important.

254
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,150
I need to know that to get the answer.

255
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,570
The answer?

256
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,940
Whether it's possible or not.

257
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,380
How did you break up?

258
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:48,280
 Hyung, you do it for me.

259
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:53,650
 I really don't think I can talk because I am so nervous,  Hyung.

260
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,510
 Teacher.

261
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,090
 You always call me "teacher" only at times like this.

262
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,230
 Why should I say it when you should be the one to do it?  I don't want to.

263
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,950
 I don't know what to say.  What do I say?

264
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,710
 Just say it, honestly.

265
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,440
 How can I?  I can never say something like that to her because it's so embarrassing.

266
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,000
 This is all your fault!

267
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,640
 Why am I at fault?

268
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,690
 Because of you, I ate the rice cake you gave me and got indigestion and couldn't take the SAT.

269
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,660
  This is all because... it ended up like that.

270
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,130
 Without saying a word to your girlfriend, because you got upset with your friends teasing you,

271
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,800
 you said that you are going to study abroad.

272
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,190
 That isn't my fault.

273
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,510
 I got pissed off when those bastards were talking about whether I can go to college or not,

274
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:37,190
 and that I can't even go to a university for physical education after winning a medal as a high school freshman.

275
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:40,900
 Ah, never mind.  It's all your fault.

276
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,830
 Hyung!  Teacher!

277
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:59,330
 Are you avoiding my call?  Are you really going to Japan?

278
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,940
 Where are you?  Are you ignoring my text?

279
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,030
 Sorry, I couldn't tell you in advance.

280
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,910
 Let's meet and talk.

281
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,860
 - Are you going to meet her? 
 - No.

282
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,530
 For now, just get through the day safely.  I will really take care of things later.

283
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:16,360
 It's difficult to meet right now.

284
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,800
 I will be arriving in ten minutes so come out.

285
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,240
 Don't come over.  I can't go out.

286
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,420
 I am going to wait until you come out.

287
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,530
 I said I can't go.

288
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,750
 Why are you suddenly using spaces between words?

289
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,270
 - Don't you use spaces between words? 
 - No.  Why?

290
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,060
 No way!  Did she catch on?

291
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:42,040
 You should have some grammar mistakes.  Ah, seriously!

292
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,430
 My tutoring you on Korean was in vain, I see.

293
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,080
 I will call you later.

294
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,120
 Are you breaking up with me?

295
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,120
 If you don't respond, I will take that as we are breaking up.

296
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,060
 From here on, you decide.

297
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,210
 Bro.

298
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:01,600
 Where are you going?  Hyung!

299
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,510
How did you respond?

300
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,780
I couldn't respond.

301
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:14,210
That's crazy.  And you call yourself a man, human?

302
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:17,200
Really, I got hurt just now.

303
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:23,220
My heart shrunk to one-third its size.  When it's only a half anyway.

304
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,110
Why in the world did you do that?

305
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,120
What do you mean "why"?

306
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,450
You must've had a reason, right?

307
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,150
I liked her...

308
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,970
so much.

309
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:45,100
That's why I was embarrassed about myself.

310
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,660
What's there to be embarrassed when you like each other?

311
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,370
There's something complicated like that when it comes to adults dating.

312
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,050
Adult, my foot.  You were a high schooler back then.

313
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,820
I am more of an adult now than you were back then.

314
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,920
Is that so?

315
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:04,090
Then, when Mr. Part-timer, who is an adult, looks at it, is there an answer or not?

316
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,460
Ah, this is a little tough.

317
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,180
An older girl I know, once told me that she was also dumped via text.

318
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,610
It lasted for many years.

319
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:16,730
Every time she drinks, she says she will kill that bastard then she says she misses him.

320
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,930
He is probably dead by now.

321
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:28,770
If there's no answer, let's just go home.

322
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,250
It looks like there is no other way.

323
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,590
Your sad story...

324
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,720
moved my heart.

325
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,440
I will especially do it for you.

326
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,590
Dating counseling.

327
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:52,860
Hello.  Who are you?

328
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,200
I think I should be the one to ask that.

329
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,630
Hyung, you're home.

330
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:59,100
This kid, he's the good-looking part-timer I told you about.

331
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,500
And this hyung is the one I told you—

332
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,310
Ah, I guess I never mentioned him.  He's a hyung I live with.

333
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,000
You work at that company here, right?  I've seen you a few times at the cafe.

334
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,620
Wow, you have a good memory.  You memorized the customer's face already?

335
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:19,120
Am I right?  Then you must be working at the same company as my older sister.

336
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,150
- Older sister?
 - Older sister?

337
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:24,430
Do you know Tak Dong Kyeong?  She's my sister.

338
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,110
- Your name is? 
 - It's Tak Seon Kyeong.

339
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,610
So, you are Tak Dong Kyeong's biological—

340
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:36,140
Yes.  A biological younger sibling.

341
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,640
Woah, woah.  Calm down, Hyung.  Calm down.

342
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,030
I can take care of everything.

343
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,650
Just think what's done is done.

344
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,060
So...

345
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:56,140
We now have secrets between us or something like that, right, Hyung?

346
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,960
That's right, Little Bro.

347
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,790
Between brothers, what is important?

348
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:08,040
- Loyalty! 
 - Then, how do you stay loyal to this older brother?

349
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,770
Keeping secrets.

350
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,590
Hey, you picked the part-timer well.  He's smart.

351
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:15,740
Of course.  Look at him.

352
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,910
He looks very thoughtful and tight-lipped, doesn't he?

353
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:21,060
He's no joke, seriously.

354
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,470
I tend to act the way I look.

355
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,280
Right, you guys are acting foolish.

356
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,220
Even today,

357
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:32,440
he stayed after work to give me dating counseling.

358
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,760
Dating counseling?

359
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,190
I am... in that area... known—

360
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,560
Actually, on Jeju Island, I was big.

361
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,600
I can picture it.

362
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,560
While you walked down the school hallway,

363
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,350
the girls were glued to the window and screamed. Right?

364
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,630
It was the same for me, too.

365
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,140
- I went to a boys high school though. 
 - I see.

366
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,170
It was a boys high school?

367
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,560
So, to continue with what we were talking about...

368
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,330
To be honest, when it comes to love, all men are pretty much the same.

369
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:12,030
But it's not the same for women.  This is what I am saying.

370
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,440
If, let's say if...

371
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,200
there are 1,000 women,

372
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,470
all 1,000 are different.

373
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:23,680
You have to conquer that which is uniquely hers.

374
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,500
So, what is that?

375
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,170
So...

376
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,940
What could it be?

377
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,960
Just pray.

378
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,160
- What? 
 - Pray that something good comes up.

379
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,560
How do you do that?

380
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,830
Ah, there's no answer to that.

381
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:48,280
So, I am asking you how do you do that?

382
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,670
This is why it's useless giving dating advice.

383
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:55,460
You need to be at a certain level to talk.

384
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,200
Right, Hyungnim?

385
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,430
This is bitter.

386
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,980
Dating or what, life isn't easy.

387
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,300
Why? Something giving you a hard time?

388
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,300
Who doesn't have a story?

389
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,200
What is it? Just tell this boss,

390
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,070
I mean, tell this Hyung everything.

391
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,930
Next time. I'll tell you when we're closer.

392
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:33,140
Our boss is a pushover.

393
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,710
I'm so sorry about you.

394
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,750
Even today's story about your first love,

395
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,700
you just spilled everything because you were asked.

396
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:45,800
If someone you barely know talks about deep stuff, you should be cautious.

397
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,390
You're right for the first time.

398
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,530
Isn't he cute?

399
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:03,130
Yeah.  He looks like a neighborhood mutt.

400
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,750
I think I'm getting jealous.

401
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:09,750
You could say something like that to a person that you just met?

402
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:13,170
There you go with your bullshit.

403
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:18,000
But he really is a good kid as you get to know him more. And he's pretty good at work.

404
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,040
You are too.

405
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,490
You really are a good kid and also pretty good at work.

406
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,690
What's up with you?

407
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,350
What do you mean? It's the truth.

408
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:38,940
Earlier when he asked you to teach him how to workout and called you "teacher," I thought he was just like you.

409
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,350
Maybe the you when you were eighteen?

410
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:46,660
- Hyung! 
 - So, you can go now. You even have an apprentice.

411
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,960
No way.

412
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,600
I'm going to live with you until I die.

413
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,500
But Hyung.

414
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,980
- Yeah? 
 - Do you like rice cakes?

415
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,850
Rice cakes?

416
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:14,670
Apparently, she doesn't eat rice cakes.

417
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:18,580
When you get sick eating something, you tend to avoid that food.

418
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:23,340
But I still like rice cakes.

419
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:27,470
But she hates rice cakes. Even though I was the one who got sick.

420
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,630
She asked me why I came.

421
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:35,920
Why I came to Korea and the reunion.

422
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:39,660
I couldn't say anything.

423
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,420
Then she told me to go.

424
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:45,630
She said to forget it and go.

425
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,260
But you know what?

426
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,260
I really didn't want to leave.

427
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,860
 Can you come right now?

428
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,220
 I can't seem to get this to work.

429
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:21,070
 I can't go.

430
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,000
Help, my foot.

431
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,620
His replies are always the same.

432
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,140
 Can't go.

433
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:45,550
 People can't go through if you're there like that.

434
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,790
 I'm sorry.

435
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:16,430
 You don't have to.

436
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,930
 - Do you like him that much? 
 - Excuse me?

437
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:24,630
 The whole neighborhood knows that you're waiting here for the guy living on the 8th floor.

438
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:28,110
 So everyone knows but Lee Hyeon Kyu?

439
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:31,330
 - That I'm waiting? 
 - I heard he went to study in Japan.

440
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,140
 Why are you waiting for him here when he's not even here?

441
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:37,160
 Then where would I wait for him? This is the only place.

442
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,480
 This is the only place I know. So where should I wait for him?

443
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,770
 What if you meet him? What are you going to do?

444
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:44,440
 I don't know.

445
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,640
 I just...

446
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,700
 I just feel sorry for everything.

447
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,530
 What are you so sorry for?

448
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:57,230
 We didn't get to drink at the Han River.

449
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:00,660
 We didn't get to go to Itaewon on Halloween.

450
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:05,010
 We didn't even get to kiss.

451
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,400
 Okay.

452
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,030
Excuse me?

453
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,260
I'm stopping the series.

454
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,290
Writer, what are you talking about?

455
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,260
We have a contract with a set date and quantity.

456
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:57,240
Did you get a better offer from somewhere else?

457
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,430
Not really. I'm sick.

458
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,570
I got ovarian cancer. Stage three.

459
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,910
Well, it wasn't great, uploading the series so irregularly.

460
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,840
Can you relay it to the company, saying something like,

461
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,130
"The series is indefinitely discontinued due to the writer's personal reasons"?

462
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:18,970
I'll take care of announcing it.

463
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,560
Writer, I...

464
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,240
Please stop if you're going to say something like "cheer up".

465
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,400
I don't really feel like saying thank you to those kinds of comments.

466
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,610
Since I can't keep my energy up,

467
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:39,930
I got more sensitive and cranky.

468
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,840
Please understand me.

469
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:49,470
Today is the company dinner, right? You'll hear it there, too.

470
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:52,740
Ji Jo King's quite a blabbermouth.

471
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,760
He's a classmate of my ex-husband.

472
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,740
It's better to hear from me than hear it from him.

473
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:06,010
I should've given you more attention. I'm sorry.

474
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:10,110
Why are you sorry? I'm the one who's sorry.

475
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,770
You should take care of your health, too.

476
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:17,940
Or just live a little recklessly. I regret it now.

477
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,140
- You regret it? 
 - Yeah.

478
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:26,170
I regret it. I should've just liked what I like and hated what I hate.

479
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,740
I shouldn't have worried about what others thought, but worried about what I thought.

480
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:35,310
I shouldn't have said nice things to others, but have done that for myself.

481
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,420
I'm done. I'll get going.

482
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:55,320
I love your outfit today. You look pretty.

483
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,180
- Sorry? 
 - You were always pretty.

484
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,510
I didn't want to regret not telling you that.

485
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,210
Please don't come out.

486
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:14,550
 Life story, let's go!

487
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,790
Let's go.

488
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,950
How did you manage to get younger since I saw you last?

489
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:28,090
And manage to come here in your busy schedule.

490
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,260
Hold on.

491
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,650
This is a little something for you.

492
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:38,060
Gosh, you're making me look bad.

493
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,780
I don't know if I'll be able to open this!

494
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:47,950
You're more than worthy to drink that. I make a living thanks to you.

495
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,600
Ten people definitely answered their phones.

496
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,080
And six of them said they got it.

497
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,130
They said they got it, not they'll come.

498
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,140
That's fine. Writers usually don't come to these things.

499
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,310
He's the only one who doesn't miss a single one.

500
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:07,270
My dream is to be a writer. Since they can avoid company dinners.

501
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:10,360
My dream is to be the CEO. No company dinners.

502
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,340
Hey. What's your dream?

503
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,400
My dream?

504
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,470
To live recklessly.

505
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:23,300
Oh right!  Have you all heard about Writer Dalgona?

506
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:26,000
I don't think it's suitable for here.

507
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,550
I think the editors should know this. What if they make a mistake?

508
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:32,950
I'm just worried about that.

509
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:37,450
She has cancer. Ovarian cancer.

510
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:40,440
- That's why her series is on and off. 
 - That's too bad.

511
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,750
I know. Her husband abandoned her because he didn't want to take care of her.

512
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:48,150
I know well because I was his classmate.

513
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:53,040
You just got to be nice. She's so stubborn.

514
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,290
I would run away if I was the husband.

515
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:05,850
What's with the mood here? I was just making a joke.

516
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:11,450
Manager Tak. Manager Tak!

517
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:14,410
You should be nice, if not—

518
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:16,790
If not what?

519
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:19,240
- What? 
 - If not, what?

520
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,060
W-What's wrong with her? Are you drunk?

521
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:25,480
What if I was drunk or not?

522
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,970
I told you it wasn't suitable here.

523
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:30,510
- "Kka"? (informal speech ending)
 - I heard "Kka-yo" (formal speech ending), Hyungnim.

524
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:33,010
It was "yo," I said it.

525
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:38,740
Kids these days are so scary.

526
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:42,560
Why do you have to be so cranky? I was just trying to make people laugh.

527
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,360
At this rate, you won't be able to get married.

528
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,580
Writer, you're a bit too much.

529
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,750
You guys are the same age, right?

530
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,680
- Are you taking her side since you are on the same boat? 
 - Hey!

531
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,530
- Hey? 
 - Why are you butting into other people's lives?

532
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:04,570
Who gave you the right to meddle?

533
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:06,030
H-Hey, Tak Dong Kyeong!

534
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:08,800
You should be meddling with your own manuscript.

535
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,550
Oh wait!  You don't even meddle with it, right?

536
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:16,120
Hey! Hey! Are you crazy?

537
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,840
A bit.

538
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,900
Even if I can't go get married, I will be going somewhere.

539
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,730
In three months, I will die. From cancer.

540
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:33,930
Before going to get married, I will be going way up there first, so.

541
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:39,150
It must be because I didn't use my heart properly. Like what you said.

542
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:43,270
Good luck with editing. I'll be leaving first.

543
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,680
What is she?

544
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,690
 Recharge.

545
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,380
 Why aren't you even crossing the road?

546
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:41,100
 - I'm scared. 
 - If you're scared, you can call for me.

547
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,640
 Through what means?

548
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,570
 In any way.

549
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:56,110
I'm seriously so scared. I'm so scared of crossing the street.

550
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:02,400
You told me to call you if I'm scared. You told me to call you however I can!

551
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,960
Fine. You're not coming for something like this, right?

552
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:21,070
Hey! I'm standing here now.

553
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:23,280
I'm standing here!

554
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,670
I'm going to jump off!

555
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:31,120
You saw last time! If I say I'm going to jump off, I will actually do it.

556
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:39,550
Whoa! Seriously...

557
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:42,850
Hey! I'm really going to jump off!

558
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:45,280
I'm really going to jump off...

559
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,410
Cold bastard. It's almost 12:00.

560
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,210
Bastard.

561
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,130
I'm really going to kill you...

562
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:36,520
The person who gets hit by the rock I throw...

563
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,610
is me in the end.

564
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,530
This, seriously...

565
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,040
 Did you hear? Something big happened at the company dinner for Life Story yesterday.

566
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,400
 That little editor... I heard she is sick.

567
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,500
Don't cry.

568
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,640
Don't cry, Na Ji Na.

569
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,060
Don't cry!

570
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,850

571
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:18,920
Pick up your phone...

572
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,540
 Tak Dong Kyeong!

573
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,470
 Tak Dong Kyeong! Dong Kyeong!

574
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,820
 Tak Dong Kyeong!

575
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:57,190
Dong Kyeong... Tak Dong Kyeong!

576
00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:00,360
- What brings you here? 
 - It's Writer Lee Hyeon.

577
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,660
Let's talk outside. Manager Tak hasn't come into work yet.

578
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,850
Did you know? That Dong Kyeong is sick?

579
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:09,160
I didn't know. I heard yesterday.

580
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:19,860
I'm a crazy bitch... Crazy bitch...

581
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,640
How did I not know that?

582
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,120
You fool... Why? Why didn't I know?

583
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,490
Let's go outside for now.

584
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,100
I will tell you everything I know when we go outside.

585
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:49,440
I didn't even know that, and last time,

586
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,950
she asked me what I wanted to do if I were to die in a hundred days.

587
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:59,350
I didn't know anything and jokingly asked if she was dying.

588
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:01,700
Seriously...

589
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,860
I'm such a bad unni.

590
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,860
If you think like that, I'm a bad boss.

591
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,790
Seriously...

592
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:13,490
Stop thinking about what you didn't do, because you didn't know.

593
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:16,210
Think about what you can do for her now that you know.

594
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:29,320
- I'm leaving now. 
 - All of a sudden?

595
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,010
I'm busy. If I want to do everything for her.

596
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,730
- What are you looking for? 
 - My car key...

597
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:42,100
- You drove here? 
 - Yes...

598
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,290
I'm sorry. I'm not in the right state of mind at the moment.

599
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:46,620
Where is my car key?

600
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,090
Let's go. I'll take you home.

601
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:50,030
No, it's okay.

602
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:52,150
I'm really okay.

603
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,420
Look at me.

604
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:05,090
Let me take you home. It's because I'm worried.

605
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:08,000
If you cry like that, you won't even be able to see.

606
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:24,480
Where's your car?

607
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,210
It's behind there–

608
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,230
Noona...

609
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,180
Noona...

610
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,410
This is a symptom caused by increased intracranial pressure.

611
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:10,300
We need to perform a thorough examination, so call me when she wakes up.

612
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:13,960
Okay.

613
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,600
Thank you.

614
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:42,010

615
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:16,940
You have been here the whole day.

616
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:23,700
What are you thinking about?

617
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,690
Nothing.

618
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:32,380
That's right. Don't go.

619
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:35,870
You decided not to see her.

620
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:41,150
You did well. Like that, don't ever see her.

621
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:44,830
Whether she dies or lives.

622
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,640
Don't ever see her.

623
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:51,390
Live like that.

624
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:57,430
Can you... live like that?

625
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:16,760
A child must rebel against the parent to grow.

626
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:22,800
Love must suffer from a broken heart to blaze up.

627
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:18,950
I knew you would come.

628
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:22,250
You endured without coming to see me?

629
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:36,180
If you hide like that, did you think I wouldn't be able to find you?

630
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:41,910
I told you that I found out everything.

631
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:46,390
That you are a kind person.

632
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:51,830
You can't run away. Before you grant my wish.

633
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,350
I told you that I will release you if you grant my wish.

634
00:58:55,350 --> 00:58:57,180
- Do you not remember? 
 - Tak Dong Kyeong.

635
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:59,980
You, seriously, I'm going to kill you–

636
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:09,780

637
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:15,070
 My life always consisted of hovering between the misfortunate front page

638
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:20,810
 and the back page that cannot be flipped to, waiting for the answer.

639
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,500
 Tak Dong Kyeong!

640
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:35,560

641
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:44,360
♫  When I see you, there's something I have to say  ♫

642
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:46,180
 Tak Dong Kyeong!

643
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:53,140
♫  When I see you, I think of one person  ♫

644
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:57,390
♫  One day, when I first saw you  ♫

645
00:59:57,390 --> 00:59:59,120
 Tak Dong Kyeong!

646
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:03,900
♫  Looking at me like the sunshine, like destiny  ♫

647
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:09,870
♫  On that beautiful day, that one person  ♫

648
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:11,990
Tak Dong Kyeong...

649
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:16,430
 At the end, the person who will call me.

650
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:21,100
♫  When I see you, even on a dark winter night 
 the moonlight shining  ♫

651
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:24,260
♫  Shines clearly with countless stars  ♫

652
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:29,120
 That kind of answer.

653
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:34,250
♫  Dream-like love, don't you know it yet?  ♫

654
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:39,090
♫  You always change me  ♫

655
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:43,610
 Sometimes, the faces of misfortune and luck are the same.

656
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:48,370
♫  I'm happy you're here  ♫

657
01:00:48,370 --> 01:00:52,270
  I still can't differentiate between

658
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:54,760
  those two faces.

659
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:59,300
♫  When I see you   ♫

660
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:03,960
♫  The feelings in my frozen heart  ♫

661
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:08,160
♫  Like the warm spring   ♫

662
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:12,030
♫  They bloom into beautiful flowers  ♫

663
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:17,090
♫  Dream-like love, don't you know how I feel?  ♫

664
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:19,320
♫  You always change me  ♫

665
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:23,850

666
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:25,750
 You don't need to use your wish.

667
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:28,690
 I no longer care about anything else except you now.

668
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:30,660
 It's pretty...

669
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:33,760
 As if it's going to disappear.

670
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,890
 I came because I have something to say.

671
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:38,680
 I don't think I should drag it out any longer.

672
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:43,560
 I hope the remaining people all forget about me.

673
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,860
 Where is Tak Dong Kyeong?

674
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:46,560
 I don't have much time.

675
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,130
 I need to make a choice.

676
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:50,700
 I want to live...

677
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:53,630
 I will save you. I'm going to save her.

678
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:57,480
♫  Every single moment  ♫

679
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:01,570
♫  Feels like forever  ♫
