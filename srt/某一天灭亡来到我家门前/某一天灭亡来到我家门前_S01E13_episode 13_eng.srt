1
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,680

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,490

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,020

4
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:33,680

5
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,860

6
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:50,070

7
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,220

8
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,960
 This drama is fiction.  All characters, places, institutions, religions, and events that appear are not real.

9
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,300
Tak Dong Kyeong.

10
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,220
How did you know my name?

11
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,260
Who are you?

12
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,490
And who are you?

13
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,880
 It's so cold today. What if she catches a cold?

14
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,570
 This kid is crawling out again, crawling out.

15
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,820
Tak Dong Kyeong!

16
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,330
 The door is closing. We are going down.

17
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,560
What is it?

18
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,030
My aunt. If I get caught, the situation will get complicated.

19
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,940
I can't get caught by her so that we can at least talk.

20
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,760
Talk about what?

21
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,920
Didn't you come here because you had something to say to me?

22
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,470
We just said our goodbyes,  so it can't be that you came to see me again because you miss me already.

23
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,330
What do you mean by "who are you"? You even know my name.

24
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,960
What do you mean by that?

25
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,140
I explained to you who I am and what I am.

26
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:31,820
I don't know. I feel strange.

27
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,230

28
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,870
Where are we going?

29
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,310
The parking garage. It seems like our conversation will take a while.

30
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,630

31
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,630
I have something to ask you.

32
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,750
It's cold, let's talk inside.

33
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,850
I can't say it there.

34
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:15,410
Inside, I will lose... since that's your territory.

35
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,220
- And it's fine here? 
 - No.

36
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,500
There's nowhere that's fine.

37
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,980
Here, it's easy to escape.

38
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,310
Let's not run away anymore.

39
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,760
- Hyung. 
 - Yeah?

40
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,430
Did you kiss her?

41
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,650
Ten years ago,

42
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,780
did you kiss her?

43
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,490
- Yeah. 
 - Why?

44
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:03,320
To chase her away. So she wouldn't see you.

45
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,830
Why?

46
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,390
She was crying in front of the building, every day.

47
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,550
If I didn't send her away that day like that,

48
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:19,630
she would've cried for many days, months there.

49
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:24,650
To tell her not to come there, to stop crying.

50
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,730
- That's why I did that. 
 - Did you not think

51
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,320
- of me? 
 - I did.

52
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,920
That's why I did that even more.

53
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,290
You knew that she was waiting for you there.

54
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:43,570
You knew and never went outside. Because you were embarrassed.

55
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,910
You acted as if you were never coming back, then you came back in a few months because it was too hard.

56
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,460
You said you didn't want her to find out.

57
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,110
Say anything.

58
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,670
Even if you swear at me, I will listen with my mouth shut.

59
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,460
I will not run away.

60
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,820
Why are you that honest?

61
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,750
You could've just said some excuse and let it slide after saying sorry.

62
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:14,280
You're good at talking, yet why are you that honest with me?

63
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,550
Because I like you.

64
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,320
You, are one of the few people I like.

65
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,600
So I don't want to be a coward in front of you.

66
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,880
I hid it for too long.

67
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,730
All this time,

68
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,950
it was stuck inside here. For me, too.

69
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,110
It's so annoying.

70
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,900
Hyung, seriously, even at times like this, you make me feel worthless.

71
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,560
Seriously, you are so annoying.

72
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,400
Where are you going?

73
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,880
- The cafe! 
 - Why?

74
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,360
I can't sleep in the same house with you tonight.

75
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,800
I regret every moment.

76
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,390
Running away, being late, asking,

77
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,800
everything.

78
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:48,030
I was crying.

79
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,700
I looked in the mirror after I came back and I was crying.

80
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,860
I didn't even know I was.

81
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,620
But when I looked in the mirror, I was crying.

82
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,380
Why was I crying?

83
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,200
Get in.

84
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,500
- Where are we going? 
 - We're not going to a bad place, so get in.

85
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:32,420
You, a girl who is about that tall with hair this short,

86
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,470
have you met her before?

87
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,160
There are so many girls who are about that height and have hair that short.

88
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,760
Have you met her at a hospital?

89
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,360
Oh, is it her?

90
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,520
You met her before? What did she do to you?

91
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,540
It's not her who did something, but I did something.

92
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,320
I opened a bottle cap for her.

93
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,650
- What else? 
 - What else?

94
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,960
I opened it for her, so she thanked me and told me to go to the rooftop because the view is nice there.

95
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,780
- Nothing besides that? 
 - Yeah.

96
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,250
Think carefully. She did something to you.

97
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,280
- What did she do? 
 - I don't know, so think about it carefully.

98
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,510
I don't know.

99
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,460
- What do you even know? 
 - What does she have to do with us?

100
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,150
Did she say she knows me? Do I not remember again?

101
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,990
Are you sure that your brain is actually sick, instead of being just bad?

102
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,730
You're the one who is bad.

103
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:40,390
Well, I'm not a nice person.

104
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,120
That's enough, right? It's my turn now.

105
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,930
Did you not cry?

106
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:56,540
Why are you not answering me? Did you not cry? Am I the only one who did?

107
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,770
I didn't finish asking my questions yet.

108
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,560
Who were you calling earlier?

109
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,490
I know. It's so weird.

110
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:11,590
I was crying and kept thinking of this.

111
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:15,460
I need to call you.

112
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,020
- You? 
- But I don't know who that "you" is.

113
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,690
On my phone, I have a number saved, but I don't know who that is.

114
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,930
Call again.

115
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,000

116
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,960

117
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,930
The person is not picking up. What is this?

118
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,620
Sa Ram... Who is that?

119
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,830
Who knows. It's for sure not me.

120
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,600
I need to go now.

121
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,360
How about me?

122
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,720
What?

123
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,160
Are you not dropping me off?

124
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,600
It's close by. Walk there. It'll only take five minutes.

125
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,730
Wow, that bastard, seriously... If only he were a person.

126
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,820
Seriously, who is this?

127
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,820
Sa Ram...

128
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,640
Oh?

129
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,390
Why do you trip so easily?

130
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,600
Look straight while walking!

131
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,730
- You said you were leaving. 
 - Yeah, I left.

132
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:46,870
Wow... Really... He's an idiot.

133
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,270

134
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,390

135
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,340

136
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,770

137
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:20,450

138
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,750

139
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:34,290

140
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,410

141
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,840
Goodness!

142
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,950
Boss! Boss!

143
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,920
You're here.

144
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,290
- Did you sleep here? 
 - Yes.

145
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:04,350
Why? Did you have an argument with Joo Ik Hyungnim?

146
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,560
No.

147
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,320
Then?

148
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,540
Currently having an argument.

149
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,690
Arguments all the time. As if they're a married couple.

150
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,900
This is the business plan that you requested.

151
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,190

152
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,820
Did you have an argument with Hyeon Kyu?

153
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,290
An argument about what? Does it look like I had an argument?

154
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,700
I guess you guys haven't had a physical fight yet.

155
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,050
We're not going to. But even if we did, I'd win.

156
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:43,390
Is that so? Are you sure you'd win?

157
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,860
Seems like you lost.

158
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,340
We haven't started yet.

159
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,290
Then fight. You won't know who'll win unless you do.

160
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,480
Father, you want me to fight people?

161
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,450
Do you know why I like Hyeon Kyu?

162
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,020
Maybe because he did sports since he was young,

163
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:03,410
his competitiveness shows in his eyes even though he might be smiling.

164
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,550
I really like that.

165
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,990
Whatever.

166
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,960
He's different from you.

167
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,110
If it's a win or lose situation, he'll go at it with full effort.

168
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:17,410
You always give in as if none of it matters to you.

169
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,090
Don't you know your own weakness?

170
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,540
You always give in without putting up a fight.

171
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,330
The situation is different this time.

172
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,940
What's different?

173
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:34,630
We're not having a fight. I need to take something from him.

174
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,320
Is that right?

175
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,460
Then this time, you'll win.

176
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:48,100
I've never seen you not get what you wanted before. Including this.

177
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,590
I'm looking forward to it.

178
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,020
If you lose and can't get over it, then you're a bad mentor.

179
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:58,510
If he loses and he can't get over it, you taught him poorly.

180
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,680
Either way, I'd have done something wrong.

181
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,490
Whatever the situation, wouldn't it be best that you win?

182
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,180
This is all your doing, isn't it?

183
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,020
What is it between us?

184
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,730
You're not going to tell me?

185
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,780
If you don't want to, then don't. I'll find out for myself.

186
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,760
I wasn't expecting you'd tell me anything anyway.

187
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:52,750
But if something happens, you can't have something against me.

188
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,200
You've been talking about ghosts lately.

189
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,590
Now you're watching dramas with ghosts?

190
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,760
What? Did you say something?

191
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,180
You're fasting but you've got so much energy.

192
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,940
Why are you watching such scary things?

193
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,660
Aunt, I'm not playing around.

194
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,230
I'm studying.

195
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,360
I need to study about weird beings like this— Wait a minute.

196
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,570
What? Why does this situation feel so familiar?

197
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,190
Is it deja vu?

198
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,230
What? Why are you here?

199
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,750
Oh my! Why are you speaking like that to the doctor?

200
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,830
Doctor? Who? Him?

201
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,880
I'm so sorry. She must not be fully awake yet.

202
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,300
It's okay. Seeing as she's not feeling well,

203
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,090
there are times when patients become a little hysterical and rude.

204
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,570
Rude?

205
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,840
I'm going to check on you.

206
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,330
Wait! Wait! Wait!

207
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,570
All good.

208
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:23,360
Wait! Wait! Wait!

209
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,970
You're all good.

210
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,380
Thank you, Doctor.

211
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,630
Am I the only one that finds this situation weird? Am I the weird one?

212
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,210
Yes, you are weird.

213
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,620
We'll do a few more simple tests later.

214
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,680
See you later, then.

215
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,440
Wow...

216
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,190
Why are you acting like this?

217
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,050
Th-That...

218
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,880
It's you again?

219
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,720
All right, stop making a fuss and take a seat.

220
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,670
This is absurd. Why do you keep following me around?

221
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,270
- Hey! 
 - Stay still.

222
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,290
You really... Do you even know what you're doing?

223
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,420
Don't be mad.

224
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,690
Really. Why are you like this to me?

225
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,460
Hold your breath.

226
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,530
You're doing well.

227
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,650
How many jobs do you really have?

228
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,020
Why are you like this to me?

229
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,480
I'm here to save you.

230
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,760
Save me?

231
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,320
Oh my.

232
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,230
If you have this on you while you get scanned, you'll die.

233
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,310
Do you know how much this is if this breaks down? I saved you.

234
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,270
You were worried about the machine and not me?

235
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,030
- Hey! 
 - Don't talk.

236
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:09,050
He's always telling me to be quiet.

237
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,420
No matter how I think of it, I don't know why I need to be treated this way by you.

238
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,370
Oh my! Hey! Stop right there!

239
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,790
Hey! I was talking to you!

240
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,350
- Patient Tak Dong Kyeong. 
 - Yes?

241
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,590
Let's go to draw blood.

242
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,350
All right.

243
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,430
Manager!

244
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:20,940
It's customary to prepare fruit baskets when visiting someone at the hospital, so I prepared this.

245
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,730
Can you even eat these?

246
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,330
- Fasting just ended. 
 - Good timing.

247
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:27,430
Is the hospital not feeding you?

248
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,190
Eating is best for you when you're sick.

249
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,890
Eat up. Eat everything! Just tell me and I'll bring it all for you.

250
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,060
I'll be on call any time of the day.

251
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,600
I'll send you all the pictures of handsome men I've saved.

252
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,820
It seems like it'd be boring to be here.

253
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,890
I'm curious, but if you look at pictures of handsome men, does that make it less boring?

254
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,830
Yes. Gives me the strength to live on.

255
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,540
They've gotten so close.

256
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,100
You're right. Makes me proud.

257
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,500
Get close? Who?

258
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:01,160
Have you prepared anything? Son of the owner of the building?

259
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,360
No way. He must at least have a comment that he's prepared.

260
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,930
Oh. Have you been well?

261
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,530
Something else?

262
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,170
If you need money, let me know.

263
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,990
- Awesome. 
 - So cool.

264
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,700
How was that cool?

265
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,520
Let's eat some fruit.

266
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,620
 Let's eat some fruits.

267
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,000
 - Don't even think about it. 
 - How could I think of doing so?

268
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,730
 You can't steal it. It's expensive.

269
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,090
 Expensive?

270
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,930
- I need to get going. Something urgent just came up. 
 - All of a sudden?

271
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,350
Sorry. I'll call you later.

272
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,960
I'm going to drink with Hyeon Kyu.

273
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,420
Go ahead.

274
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,180
I thought you liked me. Aren't you supposed to stop me?

275
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,630
What if I make a mistake when I get drunk?

276
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,420
A mistake?

277
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:14,010
Go ahead. My feelings won't change regardless.

278
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,550
If it was that easy, I wouldn't have told you.

279
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:22,080
Do you really like me?

280
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,400
Since when?

281
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,800
From the beginning.

282
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,970
When is "beginning"?

283
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,680
From the beginning.

284
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,540
You must be nuts.

285
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,920
How can a person like you make such a dumb choice?

286
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,630
I know.

287
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,310
But letting go is dumb.

288
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,100
Letting go is dumb, Na Ji Na.

289
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,220
Who calls who dumb?

290
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,620
I thought for a very long time.

291
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,990
"Why did I kiss a girl I don't even know?"

292
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:07,920
"Why did I care so much about a girl, who I don't even know, crying?"

293
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,290
There was the answer from the beginning.

294
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:16,170
But I just thought that I shouldn't.

295
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,640
Does Hyeon Kyu also know?

296
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,170
Know what?

297
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,690
That we kissed?

298
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,340
Or

299
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,190
that I like you?

300
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,950
He knows everything.

301
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,330
He knew it all.

302
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,980
That's why I have nowhere to back out.

303
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,460
What do you think?

304
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,120
Do you think I'll be able to win?

305
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,020
I don't know.

306
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,670
Why don't you know anything?

307
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,440
Then do you know?

308
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,060
I do.

309
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,130
Tell me the truth.

310
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,940
Come on.

311
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,050
I don't know. It's also driving me crazy.

312
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:25,740
How did I become the bad girl?

313
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,800
What bad girl?

314
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,490
You're finally getting compensated.

315
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,430
- Compensated? 
 - No, rewarded.

316
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,270
Team Leader Cha is your reward.

317
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,350
What reward? You've always been badmouthing him to me.

318
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,570
I always thought he was annoying ever since the first day of work.

319
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,460
But he's a good guy.

320
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,210
He's not an easy person. He doesn't open up easily.

321
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:50,240
That's why he still hasn't opened up to me. That annoying jerk.

322
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,340
Finally, to the tear-jerking love story

323
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:57,930
of Na Ji Na, a right person came in.

324
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,950
Oh, right! You don't know, right?

325
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,560
What?

326
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,560
He...

327
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:07,220
- is super rich. 
 - Really?

328
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,830
T-That doesn't matter.

329
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,410
What do you mean that doesn't matter?

330
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:13,230
To be honest, he's also pretty handsome.

331
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:17,730
And this is a secret. I never told him once in case it made him too happy.

332
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,710
He...

333
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,260
honestly is super funny sometimes.

334
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,450
He is funny.

335
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,590
If you date him, he'll make you laugh every day.

336
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:32,100
I don't know. Should I go see a psychic?

337
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,890
Should we go together?

338
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,470
- Why? 
 - Some crazy guy...

339
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,980
No, a doctor... No, No... How should I say it?

340
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,780
- What is it? Is a doctor hitting on you? 
 - Yeah.

341
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,910
He keeps asking me to doom the world together.

342
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,230
Awesome! He's saying that even if the world comes to doom, he'll only love you?

343
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,250
When did I say that?

344
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,450
That's not what I said.

345
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,890
Awesome.

346
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:56,320
A doctor who fell in love at first sight is wooing?

347
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,100
That's a great hospital romance story.

348
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,090
That not it!

349
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:02,000
Excuse me?

350
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,910
Never mind. Forget it.

351
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,420
- Boss. 
 - Yes?

352
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,030
Why did you open a cafe?

353
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,790
You used to be a swimmer.

354
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,470
You even studied abroad.

355
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,740
Why are you asking?

356
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:24,040
I sincerely enjoy working at a cafe.

357
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,510
You really seem to be born to own a cafe.

358
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:30,400
But I'm not sure.

359
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,220
Well... I got injured when I was studying abroad.

360
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,420
And was wandering for a long time.

361
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,970
Suddenly, I was really homesick.

362
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:42,820
I went to a cafe then.

363
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,880
And I realized.

364
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,940
"Coffee is the same here or in Korea."

365
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,140
So that's how you met coffee?

366
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,870
No, that's fake.

367
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:55,230
It looks cool.

368
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,380
It was either being unemployed or owning a coffee shop.

369
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,990
If you're waiting for something that's meant for you,

370
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,990
just like magic, forget it.

371
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:06,210
I never knew I'd own a cafe.

372
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,380
If it's fun, just do it.

373
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,290
Don't make fancy plans.

374
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,770
Just do it.

375
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,640
If you just do it, then you'll get better at it.

376
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,160
Then someday, it might become what's meant for you.

377
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,770
You're good. You're doing well now.

378
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,420
Still, do you regret it?

379
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,260
Well, what can I do?

380
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,170
I wasn't good enough to become a national athlete.

381
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:40,810
Not that. Your first love.

382
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:45,090
If you knew you were meant to own a cafe,

383
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,980
you wouldn't have left to study abroad.

384
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,170
Then you could've been still dating her.

385
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,720
And you wouldn't be going through the heartbreak like now.

386
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,600
Heartbreak...

387
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,000
She did more than I did.

388
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,930
I just...

389
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,140
I just ran away all the time.

390
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,940
That's okay.

391
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,130
You can just stop running away.

392
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,500
What? Am I pathetic?

393
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,920
A little?

394
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,570
Who organized the beans?

395
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:27,480
Oh, it was me. My bad! I was bad!

396
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:48,680

397
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,030
 Hello?

398
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,260
Let's have a drink today.

399
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:16,190
Okay, let's do that.

400
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,980
Boss, what do I do with the expired beans?

401
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,720
Let me just go change.

402
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,150
The cafe you work in is here?

403
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,600
Yes...

404
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,230
How are you here?

405
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,410
Athlete, swimming, ghosting...

406
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,520
I kind of got the idea, but I'm going to ask you one question just to confirm.

407
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,980
What?

408
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,040
Is our Boss #1 or #2?

409
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,620
What?

410
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:00,330
From the want-to-kill #1 and #2, which one is he?

411
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,130
- #1. 
 - Goodness, Boss!

412
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,500
Please lock the doors.

413
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,170
Let's go.

414
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,560
Have fun.

415
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:33,420
Slow down. You'll make a mistake.

416
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:41,190
Fine, just make mistakes. I'll just forget them all.

417
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:49,020
It must be easy for you.

418
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:55,140
You said you came to Korea and to the reunion to see me, right?

419
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:01,550
Me too. I went to the reunion every year to see you.

420
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:07,820
 Drink up, drink up.

421
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,040
What if you don't come?

422
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,370
What if you really come? That was what I thought about.

423
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:19,340
Sitting there, I was looking forward to then disappointed every time.

424
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:23,380
That's not all.

425
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:28,880
Because I couldn't go to the front of your house, I wandered around the neighborhood.

426
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:33,200
I sat at a cafe near your house.

427
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:40,190
I got off at the subway station near your house and sat there.

428
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,290
Just in case you got off,

429
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:52,260
every time the subway doors opened, I got nervous and nervous again.

430
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:57,800
Just in case I ran into you, I did those kinds of things a lot.

431
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,690
I didn't know.

432
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:03,020
I'm not resenting you.

433
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,420
Don't make a sinner's face.

434
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,670
I'm just telling you.

435
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:12,210
That I've been loving you alone for a very long time.

436
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,520
In my head,

437
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,550
I loved you alone the whole time.

438
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,190
But...

439
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:27,770
seeing you lately makes me think this.

440
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,610
The person I loved,

441
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,570
was that really you?

442
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,470
What do you mean?

443
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:40,050
I don't think I know anything about you.

444
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:42,670
I found out after meeting you again.

445
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,270
The person that I've been loving is

446
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,160
the you when you were eighteen.

447
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,620
I was standing there alone,

448
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,980
but you were moving along.

449
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,500
That was the same for me.

450
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,890
I don't know anything about you either.

451
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:08,320
- Yea, so— 
 - But none of that matters.

452
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,430
I'm not going to run away anymore.

453
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:13,300
- We ended things a long time. 
 - End?

454
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,980
I swam for more than 10 years.

455
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,790
Going back to the starting point? It's not hard for me.

456
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,350
I can go back anytime.

457
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,150
I kissed Cha Joo Ik.

458
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,990
I know. It doesn't matter.

459
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:38,210
It matters to me.

460
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,320
I—

461
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:50,680
I think it matters to me.

462
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,590
Na Ji Na.

463
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,550
Bitch.

464
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,010
You're crying again.

465
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,330
Why—

466
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:26,180
Why are you here?

467
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,220
Don't you know?

468
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,190
When did you get here?

469
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,950
I don't know.

470
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,960
What if I hadn't shown up?

471
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,910
I don't know that either.

472
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,990
Anyway, you're funny.

473
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:46,990
I hear that often.

474
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:50,180
You always do things that don't suit you.

475
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,710
Confusing me.

476
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,480
Confused?

477
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,400
I didn't do anything to confuse you.

478
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,230
Don't be confused.

479
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,810
I came because I missed you. I came because I like you.

480
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:32,650
♫  This is love, oh love  ♫

481
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:42,430
♫  I will stay here  ♫

482
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:45,790
♫  I dream   ♫

483
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,800
What was that?

484
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,280
I thought I'd make a mistake if I drank,

485
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,280
so I wasn't going to drink.

486
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,350
♫  It gets even clearer when I close my eyes, this is love  ♫

487
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:02,400
Na Ji Na.

488
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,290
Na Ji Na.

489
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:35,040
♫  My head is filled with you  ♫

490
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:48,120
♫   This is love   ♫

491
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:06,840
♫  I dream  ♫

492
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,960
Then make those mistakes only when you're with me.

493
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,760
Your thoughtless mistakes beat me up to death.

494
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,770
♫   This is love   ♫

495
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:33,930
♫  Now you have become a beautiful memory to me  ♫

496
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:49,750
Na Ji Na, you crazy!

497
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,340
What? My hair?

498
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,670
Yes.

499
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:03,360
Because the treatment and radiation are both being applied, it'll fall out quickly.

500
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,220
You've seen it before on TV, haven't you?

501
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:09,130
It'll be better for you to take care of it beforehand.

502
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,390
That's what's most recommended.

503
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,250
Seeing your hair fall out,

504
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,380
might be harder on you.

505
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,020
You...

506
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,970
You had a pretty head shape since you were young.

507
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:38,800
If you had your hair cut short, elders that would pass by

508
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,180
would always comment how pretty you were even with such a short hairstyle.

509
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,560
They would always compliment you.

510
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,400
You remember, don't you?

511
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,610
Yes. I remember.

512
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,600
Hair...

513
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,140
can be grown again.

514
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,740
It'll grow fast.

515
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:00,550
There are shampoos that help hair grow fast, too.

516
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,470
Yes.

517
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:05,290
Should I cut it, too?

518
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:09,100
Seon Kyeong should just shave it with you.

519
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:16,650
Don't you remember how ugly he was when he had to cut his hair before going into the military? So ugly.

520
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:19,080
His looks rely on his hair.

521
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:24,720
Let's make me the only bald one in this household, Mrs. Soo Ja.

522
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:28,160
You're so good.

523
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,350
You're such a good girl.

524
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,690
I should go

525
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:35,650
get some hats in advance.

526
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,870
I'll be right back with some pretty hats.

527
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:42,170
Don't. I have lots of them. You also got some last time.

528
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:46,250
That was too big. Your head is so small.

529
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,300
Let me see.

530
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,410
About this big?

531
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,030
I'll be right back.

532
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,890
How would you like it?

533
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,220
- Can you do celebrity hair? 
 - Sorry?

534
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,190
Celebrity hair.

535
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:57,570
With curly perm and fancy. Like that.

536
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:03,020
Miss, that's a curling iron.

537
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,880
Please do that.

538
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:12,560
There, it's all done.

539
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:18,280
To be honest, you came in in a hospital gown, so I was a little intimidated.

540
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:23,440
Sometimes people from that hospital come here to shave their heads.

541
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,700
You look so good.

542
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:31,300
Would it be okay if we took a picture of you and displayed it?

543
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:35,230
It won't show your face. Just your hair.

544
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,070
It came out so well.

545
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:48,290
- Are you done? 
 - Hold on. Just one more.

546
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:54,710
So pretty. All done.

547
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,860
Then...

548
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,980
Can you shave it now?

549
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,130
Sorry?

550
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,590
Shave it all off.

551
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:12,260
I'm sorry. You worked hard to do this.

552
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:15,560
I wanted to do it for the last time.

553
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:19,250
What do you mean last time? Please come back.

554
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:23,050
I'll do it again. I'll make you look even prettier next time.

555
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:28,400
No, I think you'll look good in short hair, too.

556
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,500
Now that I see, it wasn't your hair but your face that's pretty.

557
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,030
Will you be okay?

558
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:42,560
Yes.

559
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:55,200
Then I'll start cutting.

560
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,570
Okay.

561
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,390
Nosebleed...

562
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:05,230
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes. I'm sorry.

563
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:06,310
Hold on.

564
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,730
Bring some tissues.

565
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,540
Don't cry.

566
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,730
Don't cry.

567
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,550
Don't cry.

568
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:31,880
Don't cry.

569
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,610
I'm sorry.

570
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,220
I'm sorry.

571
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,800
What is this?

572
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,300
Where a-am I?

573
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,420
My house.

574
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:08,190
Why am I at your house?

575
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,360
Did I get abducted?

576
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,970
Kind of.

577
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:16,690
I brought you into this dream without your permission.

578
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:18,470
A dream?

579
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,380
 This is a dream?

580
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,700
What?

581
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,870
This feels so real.

582
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,450
Yeah.

583
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,440
You're making me dizzy.

584
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:14,460
Is this a prison?

585
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:17,230
Did you lock me up?

586
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:21,380
- Is that all you got to say to a person that saved you? 
 - What?

587
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,300
Is that so?

588
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,950
Wasn't that a dream?

589
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:28,490
No, it wasn't.

590
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:32,770
Then that dream— No.

591
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:35,150
That was a dream. Definitely a dream.

592
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:38,290
That was a dream for sure. Then why...?

593
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:39,530
That dream?

594
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:43,850
Earlier in the dream, you were crying.

595
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:48,350
That was a dream. I don't eat, sleep, nor cry.

596
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:50,240
I was dead.

597
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:54,530
And at my funeral, you were looking at my photo

598
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:57,260
then the tears were just flowing.

599
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:12,430
I'm not sad.

600
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,700
No matter how much I look at you, I'm not sad.

601
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:23,660
You scared me.

602
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:25,830
- Smile. 
 - What?

603
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:28,430
- Look at me and smile. 
 - Why would I?

604
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:31,530
So I can figure out who you are and what you are.

605
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:34,120
If I smile, can you figure it out?

606
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:45,680
One more time.

607
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:58,260
I can't figure it out.

608
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:02,300
Where are you going?

609
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,380
Where are you going?

610
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:08,750
Outside. I need to go out to somewhere open. It's too dangerous here.

611
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:12,830
Why? Are you scared I might do something to you?

612
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:16,930
No, I'm scared I might do something to you.

613
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:18,910
Do what?

614
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:22,980
I don't know, since I don't know who you are.

615
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:26,870
If I do, run as fast as you can.

616
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,620
Are you sure outside is safer?

617
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,610
There's nothing dangerous.

618
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:39,850
Since there's nothing alive.

619
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,440
What is this place?

620
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,360
My  subconscious.

621
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,020
Subconscious?

622
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:01,150
Like your beach.

623
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,250
That's why.

624
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:27,230
- What? 
 - You said this place was like my beach.

625
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:33,300
You live with the mindset like this that makes you so sharp.

626
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,650
Stop saying nonsense and try to remember.

627
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:38,840
Do you really not know me?

628
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,140
I don't.

629
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,970
Think before you speak.

630
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:47,050
Why would I have to think? I know when I see.

631
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:54,780
 Why should I think? I know when I see pretty things.

632
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:03,990
Have you... ever been here before?

633
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:07,720
Would I have? Think before you speak.

634
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:11,070
What? Do you think you've seen me here before?

635
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:20,530
You really must've seen me here before.

636
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:23,010
No.

637
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,980
- But why– 
 - I don't know.

638
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:30,720
Regardless, you need to get re-educated for language.

639
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:35,810
Can you speak so I understand? In longer sentences.

640
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:37,830
You are always staring at books, but what are you even doing?

641
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:41,830
Hey, tell me honestly. You don't read the books, right?

642
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:44,130
You're just holding it, right?

643
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:48,890
There's a saying written by that author.

644
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:55,090
“To die is nothing, but it is terrible not to live.”

645
00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:57,050
Are you saying that to me?

646
00:54:57,050 --> 00:55:00,020
No. I'm saying it to myself.

647
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:03,010
Since I am nothing.

648
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:05,460
Since I am not alive.

649
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:13,300
Out of that writer's famous quotes, there's this saying as well.

650
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:16,400
"The reduction of the universe to the compass of a single being,

651
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,530
and the extension of a single being until it reaches God - that is love".

652
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:28,270
Try to remember what is beautiful from now on.

653
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:34,490
Then, this place will become better.

654
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:44,300
♫  It’s about to fall off, it's dangerous  ♫

655
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:49,020
♫  I’m sorry I'm tearing up yeah  ♫

656
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:57,730
♫  The darkness falls down and disappears  ♫

657
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:03,280
♫  In the frozen time  ♫

658
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:08,380
♫  They’ll disappear without a trace  ♫

659
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:13,680
♫  Why can't it stop?  ♫

660
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:20,150
♫  My last favor  ♫

661
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:22,190
Why...

662
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:26,160
What is this...?

663
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:33,420
♫  Shining in the darkness  ♫

664
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:35,780
 Do you want that?

665
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,790
 I don't have much time.

666
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:42,560
 You have to decide.

667
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:46,120
♫  Inside my memory  ♫

668
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:08,770
♫  It’s our fate, destiny  ♫

669
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:11,090
 I will do that.

670
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,540
 I will do that.

671
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:24,510
♫  Darkness is turning red and getting deeper  ♫

672
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:31,420
♫  My last favor  ♫

673
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:39,920
♫  I'm breaking down, falling apart  ♫

674
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:45,320

675
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:54,140

676
00:57:54,140 --> 00:58:01,710
♫  Inside my memory  ♫

677
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:31,460
♫  I’m breaking down  ♫

678
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:41,860
♫  This endless night is breaking and falling down  ♫

679
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:50,450
♫  I’m breaking down, living in the consciousness  ♫

680
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:53,430
♫  Inside my memory  ♫

681
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:59,130
♫  Memory  ♫

682
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:31,450
What should I do?

683
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:36,920
I must be crazy, seriously.

684
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:40,090
I must be sick.

685
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:59,240

686
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:01,390
Yea, Aunt.

687
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:02,510
 Where are you?

688
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:04,970
I left something behind at home.

689
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:06,850
I'll be there soon.

690
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:08,660
Okay.

691
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:24,520

692
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:41,080
Hello?

693
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:06,440
♫  Here with me  ♫

694
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:10,090
♫  When your eyes brush past me  ♫

695
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:18,150
♫  I stand alone again at that same spot  ♫

696
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,730
You...

697
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:24,530
You... how?

698
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:29,770
You, how did you forget me?

699
01:02:29,770 --> 01:02:31,450
That's something I should be saying.

700
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:33,920
Even if I made that kind of decision,

701
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,090
you should've realized as soon as you saw me.

702
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:39,620
You should've remembered!

703
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:41,400
Is that my fault?

704
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,450
Did I tell you to make that kind of choice?

705
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:47,550
You just act according to your own will, without saying a word to me.

706
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:52,340
You... even if you remember, how are you always so mean?

707
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:55,980
Even if you lost your memories, did I still look handsome to you?

708
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:04,690
♫  I wanna be with you  ♫

709
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:09,280
♫  At the end of a tiring day  ♫

710
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,210
♫  Without a sound, come to me  ♫

711
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:16,250
♫  And hug me  ♫

712
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:23,730
♫  Wait for me at the end of this road  ♫

713
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:29,350
♫  My feelings for you are unstoppable  ♫

714
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:33,010
♫  I wanna be with you  ♫

715
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:42,110

716
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:48,540
♫  I wanna be with you  ♫

717
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:51,550
♫  At the end of a tiring day  ♫

718
01:03:51,550 --> 01:03:55,460
♫  Without a sound, come to me  ♫

719
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:58,740
♫  and hug me  ♫

720
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:06,230
♫  Wait for me at the end of this road  ♫

721
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:10,300
♫  My feelings for you can't be hidden  ♫

722
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:14,630

723
01:04:14,630 --> 01:04:19,180
 We can't get out of this destiny. Right?

724
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:21,700
♫  Now at least you know a little bit  ♫

725
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:24,830
 So now, let's accept it.

726
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:27,420
 Will I be in a lot of pain when I die?

727
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:29,340
 You knew, right?

728
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:32,170
 That I will make this kind of decision.

729
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:37,100
 What kind of choice I will make, I don't really know.

730
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:38,960
 We should go now.

731
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,080
 Goodbye.

732
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,340
 I didn't give up.

733
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:46,870
 - Please help me... 
- Accept it.

734
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:48,270
 I love you.

735
01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:51,580
 Thank you. For loving me.

736
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:55,630
♫  Beyond this deepening sadness  ♫

737
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:58,270
♫  Again today, I only picture you  ♫
