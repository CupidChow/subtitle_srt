1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,630

2
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,500

3
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,080

4
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,820

5
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,980

6
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:52,930

7
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,280

8
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,930

9
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,780

10
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,160
Love me.

11
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,020
If you can, do so.

12
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,690
I thought that might be a good method. So...

13
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,190
become the first human to ever love me.

14
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,640
So what does...

15
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,440
- that mean? 
 - Saving me,

16
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,250
you said you just did it.

17
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,070
So you told me to just thank you.

18
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,120
This is how I'm just saying thank you.

19
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,660
You just want to die.

20
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,990
I want to save you.

21
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,290
You're just putting it in a nicer way.

22
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,330
Is my proposal anyway bad to you?

23
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,250
Yes.

24
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,770
My feelings. I feel bad.

25
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,900
Are your feelings more important than staying alive?

26
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:18,620
You have no idea what you look like when you see things disappearing.

27
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,350
I know because I see it every day.

28
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:26,490
When I see you looking at me, I can really tell.

29
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,320
- Tell what? 
 - That you're a good guy.

30
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,310
It's not that I don't want to live, I want to live happily.

31
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,760
I just realized that now.

32
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,190
Which comes to the conclusion,

33
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,200
that I...

34
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,190
can't live happily after killing you.

35
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,230
So stop playing around.

36
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,040
 I'm sorry for causing trouble. I will cooperate with the investigation.

37
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,100
I can love. I can love.

38
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,140
- What are you doing? 
 - Mind your own business.

39
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,530
I can love. I can love.

40
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,290
You're making me mind your business.

41
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,420
I can... No, I can't.

42
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,590
Gosh.

43
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,890
You're really trying.

44
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,890

45
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,810
This isn't working.

46
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,220
I'm going to sleep alone in my room from now on.

47
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,460
Why?

48
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,770
To detach from you.

49
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,200
Let's sleep together.

50
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,270
Sleep with me, hmm?

51
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,030
Hey, stop acting!

52
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,030
You got me.

53
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,100
When you go in, I should do something with this house.

54
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,960
Hey!

55
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:48,310
I'm only sleeping here so you don't do anything to my house.

56
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah.

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,170
For real.

58
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay.

59
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,700
Do you even know what love is? Why are you telling me to love?

60
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,360
I don't, so you should love since you know.

61
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,970
Why bother?

62
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,140
"I love you."

63
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,700
"I'll die for you."

64
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,530
"Good night."

65
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:51,460
 Mister

66
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,410
How can she name me Sa Ram when I'm not even a human?

67
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,210
She's so weird.

68
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,930
Suits you well.

69
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,910
- The name? 
 - Her.

70
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,770
A weirdo is with a weirdo.

71
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,300
You're the one who made me, yet you call me weird.

72
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,530
Names are only for things that are called.

73
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,340
Now you have someone to call you.

74
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,840
- Who asked to be called? 
 - You did.

75
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,670
You whined like a kid.

76
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,080
So? Are you going to disappear?

77
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,500
- What are you saying? 
 - Wasn't that the plan?

78
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,870
Get loved by her then disappear.

79
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,200
"God doesn't not know,

80
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,340
but pretends to not know."

81
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,170
Would that go as you planned?

82
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,060
What does that mean?

83
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,100
Human love is more dangerous than you think.

84
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,060
They can abandon the world to get one person.

85
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,510
You don't know what result will come out.

86
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,970
That's always fun for me.

87
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,000
Did you see the new part-timer at the cafe?

88
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,540
Because he's a new part-timer, he's newly handsome.

89
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,000
Hey, set me up a date.

90
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,400
Hey, I only saw that part-timer once on my way to work.

91
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,280
Not that part-timer.

92
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,660
Someone around you that deserves to die.

93
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,450
Is there anyone like that?

94
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,990
You sound scary.

95
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,520
Why would I introduce that kind of a guy to you?

96
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,080
Because he's that kind of a guy. I'll handle him.

97
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,670
How would you handle him?

98
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,910
Very well, very cleanly.

99
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,110
Very neatly he'll say goodbye to this world.

100
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,870
Are you a janitor? What? Should I set you up with President Park?

101
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,020
Right! We have the CEO!

102
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,590
Look at you. Are you that stressed out?

103
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,640
Do you really need to kill someone?

104
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,190
Let's look at beautiful things and calm down.

105
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,300
Let's go. Let's go.

106
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,040
Welcom—

107
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,170
Noona.

108
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:07,010
Noona?

109
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,970
Oh...

110
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,010
First, quit work.

111
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,850
Why?

112
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,010
I'll take care of everything.

113
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,810
Take care of what?

114
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,770
Making money.

115
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,400
Seon Kyeong.

116
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,180
What?

117
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:44,890
It's really strange. It was really boring.

118
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,370
Sometimes I really didn't want to do it.

119
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,630
But now that I think that I'm not quitting but something else isn't letting me work,

120
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:55,570
weirdly I want to work.

121
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,430
Come to think of it,

122
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:02,000
this is the longest job I've ever had in my life.

123
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,340
So don't take away my six years.

124
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,940
My times are precious.

125
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,740
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,630
For saying mean things, deceiving you,

127
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,640
and stealing your time. Everything.

128
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,970
I'm sorry.

129
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,630
Hey, act yourself.

130
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,870
You act yourself.

131
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,390
Don't act like you've been given a death day.

132
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,780
Don't give up.

133
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,160
So annoying.

134
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,720
Leave. I have to work now.

135
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,930
You're not the only one working.

136
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,120
Work hard.

137
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,420
You too.

138
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,170
Okay.

139
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:04,590
I will try hard on everything.

140
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,810
 I said that?

141
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,490
I can't contact Kwi Gong Ja.

142
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:14,600
 I take that back. It was all bullshit.

143
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,480
His mom is also suddenly all ignorant.

144
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,290
She doesn't know where her son is. Does that make sense?

145
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,450
Did he say anything last time you met him?

146
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,380
Nothing.

147
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,930
The fact his new series will be in the event, is already on the main ad.

148
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,720
I'm aware.

149
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,400
- Of course. 
 - Get him. No matter what.

150
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,280
That's the only way.

151
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,080
So annoying.

152
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,600
You're not talking about me, right?

153
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,020
All so annoying.

154
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,130
You're not, right?

155
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,540
Those petty things!

156
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,040
They are all so spoiled.

157
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,910
We need to make them just dig the ground meaninglessly.

158
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,780
They just twiddle their fingers sitting in front of a desk and because we treat them like this,

159
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,520
they think they're kings.

160
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,720
Kids or adults, all of them!

161
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,020
They all treat me like nothing!

162
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,630
Seriously!

163
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,070
The writer here feels a little guilty.

164
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,080
How can he...

165
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,490
just go MIA one week before the main event?

166
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,580
What? Crazy jerk. Then give me that spot.

167
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,870
Do you write better when you're crazy?

168
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,360
Am I too normal?

169
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,070
You are...

170
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:43,820
a very rare normal writer.

171
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,130
That's why I love you.

172
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Should I just love that little pumpkin? No...

173
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,770
To do that, our age gap is too big.

174
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:57,050
Can you put some subjects and objects in your sentences?

175
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,210
It's getting hard to follow.

176
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:03,540
Unni, do you have any guys around you that are so bad you want to kill?

177
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,220
If there is?

178
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,250
- Introduce me. 
 - Should I connect you with Lee Hyeon Kyu?

179
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,360
Should I kill him for you?

180
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,430
Hey!

181
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:17,600
I'm just joking. You said you're going to the reunion.

182
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,810
Weren't you going to kill him yourself?

183
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,170
I was going to but...

184
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,180
But?

185
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:33,520
Someone said that what I'm doing isn't revenge but regret.

186
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,190
Who says so? Team Leader Cha?

187
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,560
How did you know?

188
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:45,060
Unni, Team Leader Cha said...

189
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,760
he felt pity for you. That's why he kissed you.

190
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,650
What?!

191
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,340
- How's work? 
 - Doing well.

192
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,650
Look at you talking back.

193
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,710
I heard that the cafe on the first floor is doing well.

194
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,220
I knew it when I saw Hyeon Kyu.

195
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,980
He's quite a business guy.

196
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,860
No matter how much I look at it,

197
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,620
your company is the most troublesome from that building.

198
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,870
That CEO is such a slacker. Would he be able to pay rent?

199
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,450
He is always on time because I'm taking such good care of your building.

200
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,270
Your company won't last long.

201
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,060
It's been dozens of years since I managed buildings with tenants.

202
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,210
Just by the fact you're not working overtime and cutting a steak with me—

203
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,910
Don't you think I'm trying to spend some time with my father?

204
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,980
I can never see your brother because he's too busy taking care of my buildings.

205
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,250
To me, that's being good.

206
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:47,830
Then maybe you should let me take care of a few more buildings so they keep me busy.

207
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,510
You think I'll fall for that?

208
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,860
Don't you try to suck up to me to not work.

209
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,980
I gave up that thought when I was in kindergarten.

210
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,840
This punk takes after me and won't stop talking back.

211
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,900
Father, speak honestly. I take after Mom's looks.

212
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,130
Aren't you seeing any girls?

213
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,150
You take after your mom's good looks.

214
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,270
I have lots.

215
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:15,050
You have lots? How many?

216
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,930
Well... about thirty?

217
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,350
You little punk.

218
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,640
"You little punk" means it's time to leave.

219
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,250
Since I'm done with reporting and eating, I'll get going.

220
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,250
This was well over time.

221
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:30,080
A man should take responsibility for what he started.

222
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,820
Same with girls, you punk.

223
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,380
I am taking responsibility.

224
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,220
 Na Ji Na

225
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,840
- Yes. 
 -  Do you pity me?

226
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,750
I asked you if you pity me.

227
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,970
Yes, back then I did. Not now.

228
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,270
Have you eaten dinner?

229
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,200
Is dinner important right now?

230
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,940
Then let's say you did.

231
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,400
Why did you want to see me? Probably not to nitpick on those things.

232
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,620
- I did. 
 - Then I'll get going.

233
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,630
Did you propose a contract because you pitied me?

234
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,970
Do I look like that kind of a person?

235
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,840
That's not what I meant—

236
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,010
If that's not what you meant, are you doubting my judgment that you have a possibility?

237
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,750
Or are you doubting your own writing skills?

238
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,330

239
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,700

240
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,430
It's okay. You can answer.

241
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,480
- Yes. 
 - Why are you ignoring my calls? What are you doing?

242
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,950
When are you coming home? I'm hungry.

243
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,720
It's really your turn today.

244
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,920
I'm working. I'll be late.

245
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:51,240
Who's making you work this late? What a bad guy.

246
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,610
You're the bad one.

247
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,390
What? Me? Why?

248
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,740
- I'm hanging up. 
  - Hyung!

249
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:05,190
This is the really pitiful guy.

250
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:08,790
So what about the contract? Is it a go or no go?

251
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,000
I signed it.

252
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,600
You won't regret it.

253
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,180
That really makes you sound like a scammer.

254
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,360
I feel like I'm going to regret it.

255
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,570
Well, that'll be okay, too. I've seen you regret it before.

256
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:27,400
You wouldn't know, but your regretting face is pretty okay.

257
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,520
See you at your office next time. I'll call you.

258
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,840
I'll have to look at my schedule for that—

259
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,090
Complete agreement. Complete obedience. No questions.

260
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,030
Jeez.

261
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,810
You idiot.

262
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:49,220
I got played!

263
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,030
You scared me.

264
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,450
What is this suddenly?

265
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:07,220
So did you look for a bad guy who'd die in place of you?

266
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,260
I'm searching so don't worry.

267
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,190
I still get worried even if you tell me not to worry.

268
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,160
You're special to me.

269
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:26,290
Wow.

270
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,950
Look at you playing tricks.

271
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,010
What do you mean tricks? I'm sincere.

272
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,790
Hey, if you're going to do stuff like that, at least bring some flowers or something.

273
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,190
Oh, is that what I need?

274
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,230
Gosh, seriously. Do you really want try?

275
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,790
Why are you mad? I'm helping out.

276
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:46,240
You're not helping out but getting in the way.

277
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,450
Give it back. I'm going to carry th—

278
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,740
Hey, I'm warning you.

279
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,630
Don't be nice to me from now on.

280
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,150
Give it back.

281
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,570
Hey! Give!

282
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,000
Gosh really.

283
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,420
What a pretty sight! You look like newlyweds!

284
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,690
Hi, Brother-in-Law.

285
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,060
- Hi, Brother-in-Law. 
 - Hi, my butt.

286
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,260
Why are you here without notice?

287
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,740
Me?

288
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,030
To give you this. Here, some fish bread.

289
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,110
Eat it while it's still hot.

290
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:21,930
I saw it on my way and I thought of you.

291
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:25,030
You don't know, right? My sister loves things with red bean paste.

292
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:29,320
She goes crazy when you give her things like omegi rice cake and fish bread.

293
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,270
Oh, is that so? I thought she liked flowers.

294
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,150
Flowers?

295
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,300
Well, flowers are good, too.

296
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,000
She likes to have her hands full.

297
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,300
So let's make her carry whatever.

298
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,430
Oh right!  What are you doing tomorrow?

299
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,850
Me? I'm working tomorrow in the afternoon.

300
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,890
That's good. Then go somewhere with me.

301
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,630
Where are you going?

302
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,350
I wasn't talking to you.

303
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,030
Where are we going?

304
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,610
- It won't take long. 
 - Where are you going?

305
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,360
Where are we going?

306
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,120
Somewhere.

307
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,360
Why aren't you telling? Where are you going?

308
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,820
Could  I have a word?

309
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,490
Okay.

310
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,230
It could be genetic.

311
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,160
That's the first thing that came to my mind.

312
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,130
I have him but he...

313
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:43,400
Just in case he gets sick when I'm not around.

314
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:49,600
It's a relief to confirm you have something to hold on to.

315
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,690
Hold on?

316
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,280
- Hold on to what? 
 - Your life.

317
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:59,680
Your brother called me and begged.

318
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,400
To persuade you.

319
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,480
To save your life.

320
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,970
He said he can't live without you.

321
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,990
And it seems like...

322
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,450
I'm seeing things.

323
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,920
A person dropped in front of my eyes.

324
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,670
Then disappeared.

325
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:25,000
That's not important.

326
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,930
I think it was because it really bothered me

327
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,460
that I wasn't able to persuade you.

328
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,130
So, I am going to change what I said.

329
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:40,030
Let's treat it.

330
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:44,340
Even if it's one year or even just a few months, let's have you live longer.

331
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,000
This...

332
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,150
Please take it if you are in pain.

333
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:55,570
Take it, and endure it, and please think positively.

334
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,930
I really want to save you.

335
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:05,240
I don't want to leave my next work in the hands of another editor.

336
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,650
You know that you are the best at finding mistakes, right?

337
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,140
Open this for me.

338
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:48,660
 - Unni, which bus do I need to take to go to Myeongdong?  
 - Uh—

339
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,200
Hurry up and open it for me.  I am thirsty.

340
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,560
I am right, aren't I?

341
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,180
- What? 
 - Last time, at the bus stop.

342
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:14,430
It's amazing.  We meet like this again.

343
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:20,810
Are you hurting somewhere?

344
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,930
How about you? Where does it hurt, Unni?

345
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,170
Uh?  Me?

346
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:27,070
You must've come to the hospital because you are hurting, right?

347
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,310
Well...

348
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,760
It seems that neither of us wants to talk about it.

349
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,060
It means let's talk about something else.

350
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,410
What is that flower pot?

351
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,440
This?  I am waiting for it to sprout.

352
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,430
What did you plant?

353
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,510
Well, I don't know either.

354
00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:01,190
If it will sprout or not.  If it does sprout, what will it be?

355
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,690
What if something strange sprouts?

356
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:09,450
- I will have to pull it out. 
 - Pull it out?

357
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,600
It's okay.  I just have to plant it again.

358
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,630
Since this is mine.

359
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,860
That's not mine but...

360
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,300
this is mine.

361
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:30,330
Then, I hope that something nice sprouts.

362
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:35,010
I hope so, too.  I've put a lot of care into it and have waited for it.

363
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,250
Since it's my first time planting.

364
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,650
I am done drinking so I am leaving.

365
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,660
This is a gift since you opened my drink for me.

366
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,950
See you next time, Unni.

367
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,350
Yeah, are you all done?

368
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:52,730
That crazy killer, why did he have to come to the hospital and cause a ruckus?

369
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:57,190
I really think the hospital is cursed.

370
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,420
Isn't it because of that ghost?

371
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,690
A ghost?

372
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:06,850
Yeah.  There is a rumor that's been going around the hospital for a few years.

373
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:09,120
It's a ghost who is a doctor.

374
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,580
Many people have seen it, but oddly, no one has seen it twice.

375
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,840
Ah, scary.

376
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,340
- Why, why? 
 - Why?

377
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,440
I think I've seen it as well, that doctor ghost.

378
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,190
Last time, when I came to my senses,

379
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:24,480
I was crying in front of some doctor for no reason.

380
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,160
No matter how much I've thought about it, I couldn't remember why I was crying.

381
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,550
So, I looked him up later,

382
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:33,570
but I was told that there is no such doctor in this hospital.

383
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,360
Then, who could be the person I met?

384
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,420
He's about this height, right?

385
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:43,310
No.  He was tall.  It seemed like he was at least 190 centimeters.

386
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:46,330
The ahjumma in the next room saw it, too.

387
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,950
Around 20 years of age, I heard.

388
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:53,530
I don't think so.  His hair was graying, so at least in his 50s?

389
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:56,200
Miss Nurse, you said you saw it as well, right?

390
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,020
That ghost, I am talking about.  How did it look?

391
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,910
Was it this tall or tall like this?

392
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:05,430
A young man in his 20s or an older man in his 50s?

393
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,330
For me...

394
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:11,320
it was a woman though.

395
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,220
- It's not just one, I guess. 
 - What is this?

396
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:18,050
Move to a different hospital.  It's too late for us.

397
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,900
Thank you, Doctor.

398
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:30,800
I am sorry, to make you worry about me when you must be busy.

399
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:35,160
I am a doctor trying to treat his patient.  No need to be apologetic.

400
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,150
It's natural for you as an editor to rush my writing, isn't it?

401
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:41,160
It's the same for me.  It's natural.

402
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,800
Since we are talking about it...

403
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,220
You know that the deadline is early next week, right, Mr. Writer?

404
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:55,200
When we are talking about writing, I am not "Doctor," but "Mr. Writer," I see.

405
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,990
Hi.

406
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:02,340
Hey, how did you know to come here?

407
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,880
This time, I brought them, the flowers.

408
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,910
Do you have one more younger sibling?

409
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:15,480
Awww, the youngest?

410
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,010
Him?  No, he's not.

411
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:23,570
Then, perhaps, a boyfriend?  He looks much younger than your younger brother though—

412
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:26,490
Excuse me?  A b... boyfriend?

413
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:30,250
He looks much younger... Wait a moment.

414
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:33,190
Pardon me.

415
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,850
I shouldn't have asked something personal.

416
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:39,830
Love even crosses borders.  Mere age is...

417
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:43,120
- Excuse me? 
 - The age gap is not as big as you think.

418
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,630
What?

419
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:50,010
But... have we met somewhere before?

420
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:52,730
No.  We are meeting for the first time.

421
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,370
 Noona!

422
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,060
Yeah.

423
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:01,060
- Hyungnim?
 - Hyungnim?!

424
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,670
Ah, that's right, right.

425
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,890
Age doesn't matter when it comes to a family tree.

426
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:12,320
It's the same for me, too.  I have an uncle who is younger than me.

427
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,990
The kid is about this big.

428
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,590
Hyungnim, did you dye your hair?

429
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:21,330
It looks good on you.  It suits your skin tone.

430
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:24,520
Hey, did you dye your hair?

431
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,060
It must look that way to him, I guess.

432
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,100
Then, please get home safely and call me right away if anything happens.

433
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,280
Yes, thank you, Doctor.

434
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,520
Thank you, Doctor.

435
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,020
Let's take a picture.

436
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,050
A picture?  All of a sudden?

437
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:51,230
Might as well, while you have the flowers you got from Hyungnim.

438
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,840
The flowers.  Hey, hey, they're just—

439
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,220
Didn't you receive them?  Did you pick them up off the ground?

440
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,500
She received them.  I gave them to her.

441
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,260
See!

442
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,530
Okay, come here.

443
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:06,110
One, two, three!

444
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,950
See, it came out well, didn't it?

445
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,350
Hey, what's wrong with this?  Why does he look like this?

446
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:17,050
What do you mean?  It came out well.

447
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,420
To you, does he look much better in person?

448
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,690
Ah, cringey.

449
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:24,110
It came out well.

450
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,390
Hey, this...

451
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:37,660
You know, I've thought about everything that was said earlier.

452
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,570
Do you, perhaps, look different to different people?

453
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:46,280
Seon Kyeong said some nonsense about you dyeing your hair.

454
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,740
And Mr. Writer asked me if you are the youngest.

455
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,370
When I definitely look younger than you.

456
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:54,820
That last part bothers me a bit.

457
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,750
I am asking you if I am right.

458
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,090
Didn't I tell you?

459
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:01,130
I am right?  Really?  Wow!

460
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:05,390
- Hey, then, the you that I see is not the real you— 
 - It is the real me.

461
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:11,620
You're the only person who can see the real me. That seems to be the case.

462
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:15,260
- Why? 
 - That's why I'm saying you're weird.

463
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:19,470
You recognize me, you call me, and you give me a name.

464
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,030
Oh, so that's why you asked me to love you, right?

465
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:29,630
You know, when somebody knows your true self,

466
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:32,960
your heart skips a beat. Right?

467
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,360
If you don't have any response to something like this,

468
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,580
you know it's really embarrassing for the person who spoke. Right?

469
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,270
Did I hit the nail on the head?

470
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:49,540
Is this, "You're the first woman who has treated me like this"?

471
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:53,990
Yes, you're the first person who treated me like this.

472
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,550
Everything is my first time.

473
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:09,990
Really? I see. Oh, right.

474
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,690
Huh?

475
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:35,890
Kim Sa Ram, stop!

476
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,380

477
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:52,620
Wow, hey! Excuse me!

478
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,880
Writer, Writer, Writer!

479
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,930
Writer! Park Yeong! Park Yeong!

480
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:02,010
Park Yeong! Hey, Kwi Gong Ja!

481
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:11,050
Hey, what is this? What is this?

482
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:14,410
He avoided me, he avoided me! Our eyes even met!

483
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,820
I saw you! Hey!

484
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,320
Hey...

485
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:26,980
Why? Do you want me to put you back in there again?

486
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,900

487
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,490

488
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,650
 Don't come looking for me. I'll be living in the dorm from today.

489
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:57,270
 I'm not allowed to bring things inside the dorm, so you won't be able to contact me.

490
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:02,560
 Oh, and I'll be grateful if you advertise this to your friends.

491
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,850
Wow...

492
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,730
Can you make him fail out of the competition?

493
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,680
Is that your wish?

494
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,700

495
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,710
It's... not to the point of a wish, but...

496
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:26,440
can you infiltrate inside as a judge?

497
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,060
I'm asking if that's your wish.

498
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,790
No, why are you so calculative?

499
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:34,560
Since we live together, we could help each other out.

500
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,880
Seriously. Seriously...

501
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,510
Can you not transform into Park Chan Ho, Bong Joon Ho?

502
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:20,440
What kind of writer enters an audition program?

503
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,160
Seriously, it's unbelievable.

504
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,150
What if he actually becomes the male lead?

505
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,820
It seems like he'll be in first place. He's in the lead for the number of votes right now.

506
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,600
It did seem like he's the only one with a handsome face.

507
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,160
I thought for a second that you were a judge.

508
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,520
If only I was younger, I would've entered the audition.

509
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,720
My wish... is to make a debut!

510
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,380
Wasn't that pretty good just now?

511
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,180
You know... since the topic of a wish came up...

512
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:49,870
If somebody says that they'll grant you a wish before you die, what would you wish for?

513
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:54,630
You can't ask to live. You can't ask for multiple wishes either. Then what?

514
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:57,360
- Money. 
 - Money.

515
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,890
- Honor. 
 - Honor?

516
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,170
- But what if you can only live for hundred days— 
 -Yes, Writer.

517
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:08,450
Yes, hello? Hello?

518
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,400
Hey–

519
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,580
Yeah. Really?

520
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,830
Of course. I got it.

521
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,730
Thank you!

522
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,690
- What did you say? 
 - It's nothing.

523
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:25,330
This girl is seriously affected by the season.

524
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:29,620
Hey, don't worry. This Unni will grant you a wish.

525
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,140
My wish?

526
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:34,540
I just had a call about a blind date.

527
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,440
I prepared what you asked me before.

528
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,010
- We can go after work. I set everything up. 
 - What?

529
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,740
What do you mean "what"?

530
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,650
You'll put me in a difficult situation if you pull out now.

531
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,410
Manager Jo, that—

532
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:50,410
I'll be put in a seriously difficult situation.

533
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,060
Blind date...

534
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,470
He's my boyfriend's friend of ten years. He's a really good person.

535
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:03,600
I told you to set me up with someone I would want to kill.

536
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,530
If this goes well, you will want to kill him someday.

537
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,910
Oh, Dear!

538
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:19,340
- It's unfolding like this again? 
 - Oh, Dear!

539
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,970
Wow, this is new.

540
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,710
Hello.

541
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:30,520
Dear, open your mouth!

542
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:35,280
Dear, you always do this when there's lot of people around.

543
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,560
Dong Kyeong, what do you typically do after work?

544
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,010
I usually read at home.

545
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,310
Geon Hui, what do you usually do?

546
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:53,900
I don't really do much, since I don't live with much excitement.

547
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,690
- I just exercise a bit. 
 - I see.

548
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,820
- What kind of exercise? 
 - Do you like exercise?

549
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,480
Yes, I do.

550
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,120
What... I've never seen you exercise before.

551
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:09,120
- What? 
 - No, I'm just saying it's getting cold, so hold off on the exercise.

552
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,560
You're going to get hurt at that rate!

553
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,930
Since it's getting cold, should we go indoors?

554
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:29,190
Do you want to go watch a movie next time? Do you like movies?

555
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,420
Yes! I like movies.

556
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,570
You seriously have a death wish.

557
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,450
What?

558
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,860
Do you really have a death wish, Dear?

559
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:44,750
If you keep drinking like that, you'll get drunk.

560
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,790
What is this? What's wrong with her?

561
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:50,520
Ye Ji! Ye Ji!

562
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,790
She's drunk.

563
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:56,140
Is she okay? I think you need to get home first.

564
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,430
She's very drunk.

565
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,520
Do you not think you're drunk?

566
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,060
What is this again?

567
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,960
Let's go.

568
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:13,260
Wait!  How can we just leave when they are this drunk?

569
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,250
They will wake up in five minutes.

570
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,030
Hey, but, wait a moment!

571
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,190
They won't remember anyway.

572
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:23,290
I got it, I got it! My jacket.

573
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:25,500
Ye Ji!

574
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:33,120
Hey. Just because you have skills, if you keep treating people so carelessly–

575
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,420
Then what?

576
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,290
Is that too mean?

577
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:38,870
What?

578
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:42,920
That's good. If you're looking for a bad guy who will die in your place,

579
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,130
there's no better choice in this world than me.

580
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,220
You came crawling there to tell me that?

581
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,970
I have a good idea. Your wish.

582
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:05,690
How about you wish to love me?

583
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,530
I can do that?

584
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:11,720
There's no reason it can't.

585
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,300
It can, right?

586
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,900
What kind of men do you like?

587
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,930
So suddenly?

588
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:10,370
I should know, to figure out the male lead.

589
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:14,550
I have an idea but I'd like to confirm it.

590
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,060
Handsome men.

591
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,820
That's given.

592
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:23,020
Who would like an ugly male lead for a romance?

593
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,400
Umm... then...

594
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,310
What I'm saying is that good looks are a default and he needs a heart-fluttering ability.

595
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:31,600
The reason people get tired of your male lead is that he's only handsome.

596
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,070
Being handsome is so hard!

597
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:38,260
That's why it's so hard for us who hire illustrators.

598
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,650
Was that handsomeness made by you?

599
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:45,150
You're something else.

600
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,180
A man who is successful is good.

601
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:51,090
The problem is, what is that handsome, successful man going to be successful for?

602
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:53,400
Is he going to be successful with his money or work?

603
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,690
And most importantly, what is that successful man going to lack?

604
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:58,620
Since the female lead has to compensate for what he lacks?

605
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,940
Now we're speaking.

606
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:13,810
But aren't we moving too fast?

607
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:15,330
Moving too fast?

608
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:17,460
At night, just us two, in my house.

609
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,940
It's too fast.

610
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:23,020
That can't be helped. I'm at work during the day.

611
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:26,470
And you work at night.

612
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:29,220
Right.

613
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,400
That's been bothering me.

614
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:06,660
Why? Does your heart flutter from things like this?

615
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,230
No.

616
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:15,990
Let's call it a day.

617
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:24,440
 Hyung, I'm taking off. Thanks for lending me the car.

618
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,560
Okay. Let's call it a day. I guess you have somewhere to be.

619
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,170
Then, when's the next meeting?

620
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:35,090
I'll call you.

621
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:58,360
You must use things for a long time.

622
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,840
Sorry?

623
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,910
I'll take this.

624
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:08,700
Is it raining?

625
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:15,970
It's not raining but this is mine.

626
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:26,460
I'm screwed! Why did I leave that there?

627
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,200
Why am I the only girl?

628
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,100
I did call everybody. They all said they'd come then suddenly they said they're not coming.

629
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,770
How would I have known?

630
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:04,930
They all have boyfriends.

631
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:08,680
What boyfriend would let their girlfriend go to a reunion full of men?

632
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,710
Men? Are you guys men?

633
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:11,790
Of course, we are.

634
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:16,120
By the way, how is Na Ji Na still so pretty?

635
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,600
Do you have a boyfriend?

636
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,740
How are you all still so ugly?

637
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,410
If I have a boyfriend or not, why do you care?

638
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:25,110
Still got the temper, too.

639
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:28,380
What are you going to do now that Hyeon Kyu isn't here? You must've come here to see him.

640
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:32,990
I didn't come to see him. I came to eat some chicken.

641
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:36,380
Isn't he coming?

642
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,410
- He told me he was coming. 
 - Really?

643
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:40,530
He didn't contact me.

644
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:44,030
He'll come when he comes.

645
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:53,650
Hyeon Kyu, you're here.

646
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:56,760
Wow, our prince!

647
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,990
- Our prince. 
 - You haven't changed a bit.

648
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:07,430
There were no parking spots, I had to go around a few times.

649
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:10,190
For you to have gone around a few times, you parked so close to the front of the store.

650
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:13,510
Nice car. You must be doing really well.

651
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:19,910
 Really?

652
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:25,110
- How have you been? 
 - You look great.

653
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:27,890
Me? I always looked great.

654
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:30,700
How is he not aging at all?

655
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:33,000
How could you say that suddenly?

656
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,600
- Honestly, it was your fault. 
 - That's right.

657
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,330
Does Hyeon Kyu still not eat rice cakes?

658
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:42,080
Rice cakes? What are you talking about?

659
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,070
Why wouldn't I eat rice cakes?

660
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:46,230
Oh right, then was it Na Ji Na?

661
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:49,240
Yeah. I don't eat rice cakes.

662
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,780
I really hate rice cakes.

663
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:59,850
So, Lee Hyeon Kyu who failed the SAT after eating rice cake still eats rice cakes.

664
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:05,390
Because of this rice cake, the person who had to send Hyeon Kyu abroad, Na Ji Na, isn't eating.

665
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:06,810
No way.

666
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:10,260
Do you still like Lee Hyeon Kyu?

667
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:20,000
 Let's drink! Cheers!

668
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,890
 Have a drink!

669
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,110
Are you okay?

670
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,370
You drank too much.

671
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:52,240
Are you drunk?

672
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,310
No. I don't get drunk by that. I can drink well.

673
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:57,770
Yeah?

674
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:00,590
That's a relief.

675
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:04,140
Why did you come?

676
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,110
Because I was worried about you.

677
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:10,530
I mean why did you come?

678
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:14,410
Why did you come to Korea and why did you come to the reunion?

679
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:19,910
Never mind. Go.

680
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,920
Should I take you home?

681
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:32,090
It's fine. Go.

682
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:36,610
There's a taxi.

683
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,790
Bye.

684
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:38,910
You're here.

685
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:40,920
You were home?

686
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:03,010
Oh right.

687
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:06,030
Thanks for letting me use the car.

688
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,350
Sure.

689
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:11,630
How about your first love?

690
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:17,260
How was it?

691
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:21,310
Well...

692
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:04,360
 We're late. Let's hurry.

693
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:15,500
That can be a wish? Even something like that?

694
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:20,020
 How about you wish to love me?

695
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:23,240
But still, he wants me to wish for that?

696
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,510
What does he seriously see me as?

697
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:28,220
You should talk to yourself when you're alone.

698
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:30,620
Team Leader.

699
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:34,540
I shouldn't have even started the conversation. What?

700
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:38,600
If somebody says they will grant you a wish, what would you wish for?

701
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,150
Lottery.

702
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:42,010
It must be a wish you always had in mind.

703
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:43,600
You didn't even have one second of hesitation.

704
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,190
It's a wish that anybody has in mind.

705
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:49,060
But how about if you can only live for a hundred days? Will you still choose the lottery?

706
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:53,400
What are you even debating? Of course, you should wish to live longer.

707
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,400
Anything but that wish.

708
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,700
Is the man who said he'll grant you a wish good-looking?

709
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,070
Yes. He is pretty - What?

710
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:03,310
How did you know it was a man?

711
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:06,940
No, no, no, no, that he's good-looking? No, no, no.

712
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:11,490
It's obvious. Out of all the romantic male leads, are there any who are not good-looking?

713
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:13,540
- Whose new novel is this? 
 - Oh!

714
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:17,430
Um, it's like a newbie writer.

715
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:18,820
Even if I tell you, you wouldn't know.

716
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:22,540
Then you should say you want to experience deep love with him.

717
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:26,310
- What? 
 - Isn't that how all romance begins?

718
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,200
Sincerely...

719
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:34,430
Sincerely, make me love you. Is that what I'm supposed to wish for?

720
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:37,550
That's really the only thing I can wish for!

721
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:39,780
What are you saying?

722
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,670
There's the opposite.

723
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:47,660
Instead of me loving you, make you love me. If possible, crazily.

724
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:00,040
Crazily... Love.

725
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:43,390
What are you doing over here?

726
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:46,450
It's raining, so I'm avoiding it.

727
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:49,560
What was I even expecting?

728
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,690
Were you expecting something?

729
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:55,050
Do you not have an umbrella?

730
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:59,390
If I did, I wouldn't be standing here like this.

731
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:00,860
I don't have one either.

732
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:02,620
I know.

733
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:14,630
What kind of life is this for there to always rain...

734
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:17,630
and never having an umbrella when it's raining?

735
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:26,070
Do you want to run?

736
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:27,750
What?

737
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,730
Hey, hey, hey!

738
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:46,560
- Hey! Can you not stop rain? 
 - I can.

739
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,560
Then why are you running?

740
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,420
- It's fun. 
 - What?

741
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:53,260
Hey!  Wait a moment!  Wait a moment! Let go, let go!

742
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:57,460
Seriously, what is this! I'm all drenched!

743
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,300
If this was going to happen anyway, I should've walked instead.

744
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,730
Then I would've had less of a hard time.

745
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,450
Are you still having a hard time?

746
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,890
I'm okay now.

747
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:13,880
I feel like I can finally live now.

748
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,600
See.

749
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:18,920
Rain is not a big deal, right?

750
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:22,760
It's not a big deal even if you're the only person who doesn't have an umbrella.

751
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:26,290
You can just get drenched. If you get drenched and run,

752
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,250
you'll reach home soon.

753
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:47,100
I have a wish.

754
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:56,040
I want you to love me.

755
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:03,650
Can I make that my wish?

756
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:08,920
No.

757
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:21,290

 Stop!

 Let me take you home. It's because I'm worried.

 Did you know that Dong Kyeong is sick?

790
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:26,950
 So you're saying you want to receive love from that girl?

791
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:29,160
 I came to the wrong conclusion.

792

 What... do you mean by that?

793
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:35,120
 Because of my existence, you're miserable.

794
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:38,850
