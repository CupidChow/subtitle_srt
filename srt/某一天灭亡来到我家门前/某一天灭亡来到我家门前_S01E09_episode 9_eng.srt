1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,680

2
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,580

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,200

4
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,890

5
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,950

6
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:47,920

7
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,240

8
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:05,000
 This drama is fiction.  All characters, places, institutions, religions, and events that appear are not real.

9
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,110

10
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,690
 There was a time when I wanted to belong to their crowd.

11
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,600
 Eat like them,

12
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,480
 fall asleep like them...

13
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,340
 Hello.

14
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,950
 Daddy!

15
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,670
 ...have feelings like them, and love like them.  That was what I wanted to do.

16
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,760
 Still can I belong to their crowd?

17
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,780
 They always leave.

18
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:50,890
 They always have places to go.  Unlike me.

19
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,080

20
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,830

21
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,170
 That is when I realized

22
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,990
 I, without places to go to, I, without the end to this life,

23
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,090
 can never be them.

24
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:45,410
 My job is to observe them to the end.

25
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,690
So choose.  The world or you.

26
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,130
 Just observing them...

27
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,510
You, darned girl, aren't you going to stop right there!

28
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,380
I know that expression of yours, Aunt.  And how can I stop?  I can't!

29
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,600
You, darned girl!

30
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,170
Well,

31
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,640
I am sorry to drop by so suddenly but...

32
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,530
 Who is it?

33
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,720
Wait on the first floor.  I'll come down.

34
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,520
 Answer me if you heard.

35
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,760
I have to step outside for a bit.  I'll be back.

36
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,010
This...

37
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,840
- If it is because of me, I'll leave.
- I am sorry, it's not you but—

38
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,810
Is something the matter?

39
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,270
He came.  Lee Hyeon Kyu.

40
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:18,260
Um, I am sorry but can you leave a little bit after I leave?

41
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,050
- For nothing... 
 - I understand.

42
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,320
I am sorry.

43
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,370
Nothing to be sorry about, but I do feel... a bit weird.

44
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,820
Who gave you my address?

45
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,840
Here and there, I inquired.

46
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,490
Because they told you, because you found out, did you judge that you could come?

47
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,720
No.  I thought I should never do that.

48
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,600
- And? 
 - I couldn't help it.

49
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,920
Because I missed you.

50
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,480
I came to Korea because I missed you.

51
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,190
I went to the class reunion because I missed you.

52
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,940
And now I came to tell you this.

53
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,720
You always do what you want.

54
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,140
  - Hello, Senior.
 - Oh, okay.

55
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,720
 Don't you always do what you want?

56
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,900
 How can you make me hear the news about your going abroad from others?

57
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,390
 How can you make me chase you down like this!

58
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,630
 - Sorry. 
 - Why don't you reply to my texts?

59
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,150
 Are you really asking for a breakup?

60
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,930
 Because I felt so sorry...

61
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,160
 If you were sorry, you should've replied.

62
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,010
 If you were sorry, you should've come to see me.

63
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,260
 Really sorry.

64
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,030
 You're always like this.

65
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,270
 Because I liked you first, because I like you more...

66
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,190
 You know that.  Knowing all of that...

67
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,330
 Forget it.

68
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,460
 It's not like that.  I'll explain everything.

69
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:31,020
 I said I'd go abroad to study,  I didn't say I'd break up with you.

70
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,060
 See?  Again, you're doing what you want.

71
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,190
 You thought I wouldn't be able to break up with you at that time.

72
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,190
Dragging things out like that, we'd have broken up in the end in a wishy-washy way.

73
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,860
I've regretted it all this time.  Then, I was too young and...

74
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,990
Going to someone's house willy-nilly and waiting for that person willy-nilly.  I know it because I've done it, too.

75
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,530
No matter how much I agonize over what I'm going to say when coming face to face with that person, there is no answer.

76
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,690
But still just...

77
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,720
I just ended up waiting.  Just.

78
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,340
- Na Ji Na. 
 - But you're different from me.

79
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:17,420
After all...  I didn't get to see you.

80
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,690
But you got to see me.

81
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,630
You should've come then, like right now.

82
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,130
Nine years is too late.

83
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,590
I know, I don't expect anything to happen.

84
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,360
I-I... just wanted to answer your question.

85
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,360
If that complicates things for you, then just forget about it.

86
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,770
I am sorry.  Now don't think about me.

87
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:43,600
But I end up doing it.  After seeing you like this, for a while your thoughts occur to me.

88
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,350
See, even now, I ended up sitting before you.

89
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:55,780
When I am before you, it feels like I've returned to that place, that time.

90
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,550
Every day, it felt damp.

91
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,370
That swimming pool floor and in the rain, too.

92
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,090
Every day, for me

93
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,740
liking you felt damp.

94
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,330
Even though it might've felt fluffy to you.

95
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,980
If I am asked to return to that place,

96
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,720
well...

97
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,530
Still, I liked it all.

98
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,340
Still, everything...

99
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,850
felt good to me.

100
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,750
Aunt, calm down! Calm down!

101
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,540
How can I calm down right now?

102
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,980
- Damned Tak Seon Kyeong! 
 - How dare you blame others?

103
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,560
Aunt! Aunt...

104
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,750
Aunt, time out, out, out, out.

105
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,830
Aren't you going to come here?  Come here, you!

106
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,840
I really didn't do it on purpose.

107
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,240
You just come here while I'm speaking to you nicely.  Come here, you!

108
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,470
But you're not speaking nicely right now, Aunt.

109
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,600
Aunt.

110
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,470
Aunt!

111
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,220
Aunt, are you okay?  Aunt?!

112
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,380
Got you, you little...

113
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,660
But how can you do this?  This is foul play, foul!

114
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,940
Hey, the one who played foul first was you.

115
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,680
Ah, Ms. Soo Ja!  Let go first, please.

116
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,110
- Let this go please! 
 - So hard.

117
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,110
Aunt, Aunt, Aunt!

118
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,460
 (What?)

119
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,330
I want you to sit

120
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,810
I don't want to sit on the floor—

121
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,760
Once in a while, he acts American.  Once in a very long while, but he acted that way just now.

122
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,950
I'm sorry for the late greetings, Mr. Boyfriend.

123
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:18,720
I am Kang Soo Ja, Dong Kyeong's aunt.

124
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,650
Yes, my aunt, Kang Soo Ja.

125
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,720
Boyfriend?

126
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,900
- I've heard a lot about you. 
 - Heard a lot from whom?

127
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,220
Tak Seon Kyeong, this little...

128
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,570
I was very rude at the first meeting.

129
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,190
You must've been shocked.

130
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,550
I am okay.  Do not worry about it.

131
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,320
But where do you live?

132
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,900
It's very... late.

133
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,220
Ah, this is where I—

134
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,220
So late, too late.  Time is getting really late.

135
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,790
- Let's go home, home, okay? 
 - You said sit.

136
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,680
But now, stand up.  Hurry.

137
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:06,970
What did you say?  I'll say, it's such a relief.  The last bus hasn't run yet, right?

138
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,240
Hey!  Let's quickly go.

139
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,630
I'd love to have a drink with you,

140
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,210
but as you see, an important family matter has come up so...

141
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,090
What?  You're okay with this?

142
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,690
Right?  Aunt, he says he's okay.

143
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,170
Hold on a second.  This.

144
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,670
Hey, go quickly.

145
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,450
I'll call you.

146
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,960
Goodbye!  Yes.

147
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,520
She is so unpredictable, every time.

148
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,360
Aunt...

149
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,930
I can see through you, I can.

150
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,340
So I am not angry with you.

151
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:29,380
"It will be burdensome.  It will be a nuisance."

152
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:34,250
It's obvious that with those thoughts, you did not contact me.

153
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,510
The color is perfect.

154
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,750
I bought it during a sale last year.  It's pretty.

155
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,670
It was a good buy.

156
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,970
You've been like this since 10 years of age.

157
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,920
Always studying my mood, acting like a polite guest.

158
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,190
But why study my mood?

159
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:58,890
You're going to do everything as you please, but you study my mood too.

160
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,060
You stress yourself out.

161
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,770
So how can you not be sick?

162
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,110
Aunt...

163
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,880
Until when are you going to act polite?

164
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,150
Are you a guest who walked into my life?

165
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,040
But why is this hat so big?

166
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,180
Or is it your noggin that's small?

167
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,100
I bought it thinking this size would fit you.

168
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,780
I'll have to give this to Seon Kyeong.

169
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,620
There are a few summer dresses I bought, too.

170
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,910
Do you want to try them on now?

171
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:43,770
I bought one or two every time I thought of you in Canada and they piled up like this.

172
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,140
You have to wear them all according to the season.

173
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,980
We have to get the money's worth out of them.

174
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,920
I boarded that plane with that resolve.

175
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,980
So brace yourself, okay?

176
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,820
Don't give this to Seon Kyeong.  It's mine.

177
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,040
Aigo, you're just like your mom with your love for clothes.

178
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,750
Do you know how many dresses my sister stole from me?

179
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,740
That's why I was not going to steal your life...

180
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,130
You never stole it.

181
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,500
I just gave it to you.

182
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,280
Because I wanted to give it to you.

183
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,130

184
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,180
 Did you get home safely?

185
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,840
 Earlier, I was so discombobulated.

186
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,400
- You are here? 
 - Yes.

187
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,830
- You got cleaned up? 
 - Yes.

188
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,460
You wash up, too.

189
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,160
Yes, rest up.

190
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,910
Rest up.

191
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,250
Hello?

192
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,640
 Yes.

193
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,790
You know how to answer the phone?

194
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,580
- I know how to hang up, too. 
 - Hey!

195
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:43,080
I am calling you secretly without my aunt knowing about it.  Don't make me yell.

196
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:50,360
Um... what are you doing?  Are you home?

197
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,580
Why?

198
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,820
I'm just curious, after sleeping together every day.

199
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,210
You only pay attention to certain words.

200
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,280
Ordinarily, you speak with such little reservation.

201
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,480
Do I?

202
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,770
Hey, you know...

203
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,580
Yes.

204
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,710
Is "yes" all you know how to say?

205
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,290
Yes.

206
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,240
They resemble...

207
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,560
each other, your aunt and your mom.

208
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,240
Not just resembling, but they are the same since they're twins.

209
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,410
When I see aunt, it just feels like seeing Mom.

210
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,490
Always looking at Aunt

211
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:39,850
and only thinking my mom would've looked like this, like this...

212
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,830
But when I actually saw her, she was different.

213
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,630
Thank you.

214
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,540
I didn't get to say that.

215
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:57,090
Thank you for showing me my mom and dad.

216
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,560
Yes.

217
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:06,680
And I will also think carefully about the wish, too.  For myself.

218
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,560
All right.

219
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,910
Do you not know how to say anything besides "all right?"

220
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,220
I know how to say "Good night."

221
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,030
Good night.

222
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:28,730
Wow, this is so new and awkward. Talking on the phone like this.

223
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,160
- All right, hang up. 
 - Ah, wait.

224
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,660
  What?

225
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,880
You said earlier that you would listen to pretty much any favor I ask, right?

226
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:43,980
So, I was wondering, can I ask just one favor?

227
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:55,450
Recently, new medicine from clinical research passed the safety check,

228
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,050
so they're recruiting additional patients right now.

229
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:02,620
Tak Dong Kyeong is on the waitlist right now, too.

230
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,150
Then, when can she start treatment, Doctor?

231
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:10,630
We have to wait for blood results first, so that'll take two weeks.

232
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,410
If she's a candidate, she can just periodically come into the hospital for treatment.

233
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:17,600
See, Aunt? Let's just wait a bit.

234
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,280
Yeah? Just be at peace.

235
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:25,850
Are you sure she doesn't have to be immediately hospitalized right now?

236
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,190
Yes, she's fine.

237
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:34,540
There's a chance though, right? Can she live?

238
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:38,180
Yes, we're in the process of saving her right now.

239
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:51,960
Didn't you tell me your boyfriend's a doctor yesterday? Where's his hospital?

240
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,830
Oh, him? He...

241
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:58,570
He's a doctor in... America. An American doctor.

242
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,120
Ah, America.

243
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,440
So, that's why you said he was American a few times.

244
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,750
Yeah. Right.

245
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:10,050
Compared to your doctor from earlier, your boyfriend

246
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:13,850
is slightly lacking in his looks, but.

247
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,950
L-Lacking?

248
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,740
Hey, but there's no way for a person to be that picky about appearances, right?

249
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,730
As long as he's a good man, that's all that matters.

250
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:24,210
Seon Kyeong was saying he's a really good person.

251
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:29,720
Well, the way he looks isn't unattractive or anything.

252
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,090
Oh, I see you've fallen completely for him.

253
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,500
Then, while I go pick up my Canadian husband from the hotel,

254
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,860
you can go meet your American boyfriend.

255
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,280
You know, you didn't have to come all the way to Korea.

256
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,590
Kevin loves you so much.

257
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:52,160
Don't say things like that. He'll be upset, you know?

258
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,530
Kevin wanted to find a house in Korea for us all to live in. It took so much effort to stop him.

259
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:07,260
I'll be going. I'll be back soon.

260
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,090
Yeah.

261
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,260
I'm asking for my phone.

262
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,100
Ah.

263
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,300
- All done? 
 - Yeah.

264
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,820
- I'm off. 
 - To where?

265
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,900
You said you were all done.

266
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,740
I'm all done with the phone. Not with you.

267
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,780
Here.

268
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,580
- What's this? 
 - A phone.

269
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,310
- Is it your first time seeing one? 
 - No, I saw one yesterday.

270
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:02,220
Geez, just take it.

271
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,410
No, but why?

272
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:08,980
Something like yesterday might happen again, you know?

273
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,120
I've thought it all out.

274
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,510
Are you sure you weren't just excited from calling each other before bed yesterday?

275
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:19,190
Well, that's a bit right.

276
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,420
- Who's paying the bills? 
 - So I was wondering...

277
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:24,560
what's your bank account number? Your card number works, too.

278
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:28,730
- Does it even work? 
 - You really...

279
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,700
Here.

280
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,060

281
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,030

282
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:46,150
It'd seem less personal if I put my last name in, so I didn't.

283
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:52,020
All right, we got each other's numbers. What's next?

284
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,090

285
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,000
- What are you doing? 
 - Take it.

286
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,420
Are you free?

287
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,260
Isn't this what's next after exchanging numbers?

288
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,850
What if I'm free?

289
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,970
Let's play.

290
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,650
What's this? Why are we here?

291
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,820
What's this? A gift for me?

292
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,390
- No, your job. 
 - Job?

293
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:42,890
You've become more materialistic lately. Do you want me to buy you something?

294
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:02,540
Grandma, is the teacher not coming?

295
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:06,720
The ship coming to the island apparently got canceled.

296
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,100
I don't think your teacher can come.

297
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,650
So, I can't graduate?

298
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:15,290
Graduation? You can just do it with your grandma!

299
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,620
Your diploma is right here, too.

300
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:22,280
I want the teacher to give it to me.

301
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,550
Teacher!

302
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:33,740
Oh, Teacher! I thought you wouldn't make it.

303
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:38,270
Of course, I had to. It's this school's last graduation.

304
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,220
Who are you?

305
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,810
Oh? Oh, I'm...

306
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,250
She came here to take pictures. From Seoul.

307
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,280
From Seoul? Did you take the plane?

308
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:59,180
Yes, to take pictures of you.

309
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:04,740
All right, I'm taking the shot.

310
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,050
One, two.

311
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:10,560

312
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:20,040
So, this school is disappearing now?

313
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:25,110
There aren't any new students or teachers to come.

314
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,970
Where'd the actual teacher go?

315
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,700
He must be going somewhere.

316
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,600
What? To his dreams?

317
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,900
No. In the opposite direction of life.

318
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:42,960
By now, he should've arrived at the garden.

319
00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:00,380
That kid. The one in the garden.

320
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:04,400
I've seen her in the hospital.

321
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,410
She was wearing a patient gown at that time.

322
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,620
She's sick.

323
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,870
Sick?

324
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,620
She's always sick.

325
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:19,510
She's sick from birth and for the rest of her life, then she dies.

326
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:24,560
Then, she's reborn, is sick for all her life, then she dies again.

327
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,600
That's how she keeps the world the way it is.

328
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,300
She suffers and dies for the sake of all of the world's sins.

329
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,910
That's the work of god.

330
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:44,940
I've seen her like that for a long time.

331
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,030
I thought I was the most pitiful.

332
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,670
But I was nothing after all.

333
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,870
If nothing existed from the beginning,

334
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,770
would the world be peaceful?

335
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:06,810
If nothing happened.

336
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,050
Stay where you are.

337
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,940
What? Why?

338
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:37,890
During that one second that you froze, there was no doom at all.

339
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:41,430
It was the perfect world you were hoping for.

340
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,960
  Strange, right?

341
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:52,540
  That one second to me, felt like eternity.

342
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,660

343
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,910
You're still so pretty.

344
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,690
I'm the only one getting older.

345
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:15,250
Now, Unni, you need to call me unni.

346
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,890
Sis,

347
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:29,230
even though you miss her,

348
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,800
just give her a little more time.

349
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,680
A little later...

350
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:41,360
Please take her a little later...

351
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,410
Our Dong Kyeong...

352
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,510
 One thing I realized while living, is that "forever"

353
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:02,980
 cannot be attached to something that is ongoing.

354
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:07,120
 While loving "forever" is almost impossible,

355
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,760
 losing "forever" is always possible.

356
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:19,240
 But we always live because of the things that don't last forever.

357
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,630
 For example, dream.

358
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,600
The two lattes you ordered are ready!

359
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,520
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

360
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,960
- It's delicious! 
 - Really?

361
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,890
 Memory, regret,

362
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,050
 those things.

363
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,310

364
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,240
 Or love, a person.

365
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,740
 Those things.

366
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:57,030
 A person and love are similar.

367
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:01,160
 I shouldn't have given you that kind of name.

368
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,520
Hey, come out. I have something I want to do with you.

369
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,480
Why am I here right now?

370
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,960
I have a purpose today.

371
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,200
- What? 
- I'm going to spend money purposefully.

372
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,690
This is my first time doing this in my life, so I need you.

373
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,860
Why do you need me?

374
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:26,010
You can be entertained while I spend money. So you can have fun.

375
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,660
Give me everything from here,

376
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:38,050
to all the way here.

377
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,230
All this?

378
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:42,670
Yes. In size 270.

379
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,700
Till here.

380
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:13,240
You have two feet. Do you need to buy this many?

381
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,430
If you want to wear them according to season, you need that many.

382
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:19,360
Do you know how roughly Tak Seon Kyeong wears his shoes?

383
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,500
Next, over there!

384
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:34,660
Then, do you know what the writers get gifted the most, even if they don't like it?

385
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,080
- What is it? 
 - A pen.

386
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,660
You would think writers would need it,

387
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,320
but they don't really have a reason to use them anymore.

388
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,350
But they can't just throw away something that pretty and expensive.

389
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,550
You just have to keep them.

390
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,410
But why are you buying it then?

391
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:54,090
That Unni thinks more about things she doesn't like, than things she likes.

392
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:56,110
She can never forget.

393
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,050
Can you show me this?

394
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:15,590
I'm sorry, but there's only one left in stock.

395
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:21,420
Can you concede this to me? I waited three months for it.

396
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,940
I have...

397
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,740
three months left.

398
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,910
I...

399
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,530
am terminally ill.

400
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:37,930
So before I die,

401
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:42,680
I wanted to give my aunt her last gift.

402
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:56,660
Please be strong.

403
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,780
Thank you.

404
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,160
Oh yeah!

405
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:30,360
This is the first time in my life that I shopped like this.

406
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,400
This is why you earn money, huh?

407
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,790
Who's the next gift for?

408
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:38,360
Next is myself.

409
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,740
Hey, I'm going to take the picture after pressing this.

410
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,760
Can you smile, even if you don't want to take it?

411
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,000
It's not that I don't want to take it.

412
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,030
Why are you taking it?

413
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,660
- Huh? 
 - So you can look at it later?

414
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,410
Then shouldn't you only take pictures of me?

415
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:07,180
 Humans are so strange.

416
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:10,950
 Why do they want to leave those things behind? They can't even see it anyway.

417
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:13,650
 It's not for me, it's for others to see.

418
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,680
 I do that sometimes.

419
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:21,620
You never know who will see it.

420
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:30,540
Look at the front! I'm taking it. Smile!

421
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,810
I'm taking it!

422
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,140
When are you going to give me this?

423
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:03,040
I don't know... later.

424
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,220
When I feel like it.

425
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,330
Hey, give me your phone.

426
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:09,630
Can't you see I have no hands?

427
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,060
- What are you doing? 
 - Wait a moment.

428
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,820
Ta-da!

429
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,490
- Hey! 
 - Hey, you don't have any hands right now. Hold still.

430
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,740
Goodbye!

431
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,520
Tak Dong Kyeong!

432
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,940
Just let it slide! Do we have to fight over something like this?

433
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,760
I'm confident in my fighting abilities, as you know!

434
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,880
I'll see you later.

435
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,280
Oh... later.

436
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,440
Huh? Later? When?

437

Yeah.

Wow...

444
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,620
Well, you would never take me to somewhere like this in real life.

445
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:30,470
- You worded it weirdly. 
 - You said you don't eat or sleep.

446
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:34,350
But because of you, I am eating and sleeping right now.

00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:02,740
If I eat in my dream, I won't gain weight. Right?

454
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,850
- Are you happy? 
 - No.

Are you up? Let's eat.

I called them so I can feed them.

Why didn't you tell me that your aunt was here?

Okay.

00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,220
How long has it been?

487
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,590
When did you prepare all this?

488
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,210
You like this.

489
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,550
Thank you for the meal!

490
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:34,810
Eat up!

491
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:46,520
 I'm changing.

492
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,660
 Talk like this.

493
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:55,160
I'm sorry for not listening to you.

494
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,600
I won't do that anymore.

495
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:02,970
This isn't a compromise, but it's me giving in.

496
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:08,360
 Why? So you can be a nice guy?

497
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,890
I'll try.

498
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:13,750
So that you won't have to worry.

499
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:17,870
 What am I worried about?

500
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:20,040
She will never abandon the world.

501
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,080
I'll make sure it doesn't happen because that's what I want.

502
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:32,880
And I've been meaning to tell you.

503
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:37,200
I've always taken pity on you.

504
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,230
I've pitied you longer than I felt resentment towards you.

505
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,520
Thank you for letting me be born.

506
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:52,400
Lately, that's what I've been feeling.

507
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,120
What are you talking about? Not renewing the contract?

508
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:29,140
What are you saying?

509
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,100
It's just as it sounds.

510
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,590
The person in charge said if it's not with Tak Dong Kyeong, they won't sign with this company.

511
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:36,040
What a load of nonsense.

512
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,510
Tell them we don't want it either.

513
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:42,390
She's not even famous as a writer.  Fire that Writer Lee Hyeon.

514
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:45,090
Hey! Go and tell them straight.

515
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:48,600
It's not you, but I'm the one that's not going to do this.

516
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,850
So rude.

517
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:51,780
Novelist Dalgona doesn't want to either.

518
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:52,680
What? Why not?

519
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,080
Novelists Siberia and Jeong Dang Myeon too.

520
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,240
What's with them?

521
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,550
Same with Writer Kwi Gong Ja whom Manager Tak was barely able to convince to come back recently.

522
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:05,940
Not him! He's one of our company's top 10 novelists!

523
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,890
You heard them, right?

524
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:11,130
Team Leader Cha, do something.

525
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:13,500
You'll do something about this, right?

526
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,970
Do what?

527
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:19,720
Bring back the novelists, or bring back Tak Dong Kyeong!

528
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,160
- Why should I? 
 - What—

529
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,620
Important matters like this, the CEO should take care of.

530
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,000
What?

531
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,270
Are you trying to tell me that I need to take care of it because I'm the one that caused this?

532
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:34,040
No, I'm saying that such an important matter should be taken care of by the CEO.

533
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,640
But you do know that this all happened because of you?

534
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,940
I thought you didn't know.

535
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:43,490
Contact Tak Dong Kyeong immediately.

536
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:47,700
Why aren't you guys responding?

537
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,670
Why don't you try, CEO?

538
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:51,940
She's ignoring my phone calls!

539
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,140
Hey. What did you just say?

540
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:05,670
Is there anyone here who can be addressed as "hey, you"?

541
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,700
If the meeting is over, I'll get going.

542
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:13,170
"That one," "this one," "hey, you," all are behind in our work, so...

543
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,930
I'm the CEO.

544
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:37,080

545
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,960

546
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,950

547
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,370
Honestly, I didn't think the writers would act like this.

548
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:49,840
That's what I say.  I expected one would react that way.

549
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,050
You mean Writer Lee Hyeon?

550
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:58,590
 Did you get back home safely?  Earlier, I was so distracted...

551
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,300
But how do you, Team Leader, know Writer Lee Hyeon?

552
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,470
What?

553
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:18,550
Why are you acting like this today? Right now and earlier in the meeting room, too.

554
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:21,540
- What do you mean? 
 - Your mind's been elsewhere since earlier.

555
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:24,460
Where did it go? Some place nice?

556
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:27,330
I don't think it's a nice place.

557
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:30,890
I am asking you how do you know Writer Lee Hyeon?

558
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,760
Well... I once met her in place of Manager Tak.

559
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,380
- Where are you going? 
 - Playing hooky.

560
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:56,330
Enjoy!

561
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:57,980
Thank you.

562
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:01,340
Are you sober now?

563
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,440
I've never been drunk in my life.

564
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,660
I've been fine since yesterday.

565
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,670
Is that why you were talking casually to me?

566
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:09,030
Sorry. I think I may have been drunk.

567
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:12,010
My alcohol tolerance is only 3 shots of soju.

568
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,280
Thanks.

569
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,900
For what?

570
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,710
That my tolerance is just 3 shots?

571
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,070
Just.

572
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,360
- Hyungnim! 
 - Let's talk.

573
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,590
What would you like to order?

574
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:32,580
Let's talk.

575
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,880
Your CEO is sitting at a table behind you.

576
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,090
Lee Hyeon Kyu.

577
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:39,700
  .

578
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,180
Look at this guy.

579
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:47,780
Do you think I placed you here so that you could just waste your time like that?

580
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,760
Hyung, hang up for a second. The building owner.

581
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,170
I'll call back later.

582
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:56,310
What are you doing here? Do your father's words mean nothing to you?

583
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,430
Team Leader Cha.

584
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:01,120
Father?

585
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:08,140
Father!

586
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,610
Father!

587
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:11,580
Why are you here without any notice?

588
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:14,330
Who are you here with? Did you come by yourself?

589
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:16,520
Where–

590
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:26,160
Where are you going?

591
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,470
Father, why are you being like this?

592
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:50,450
Why are these punks causing such a ruckus?

593
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:58,600
I'm telling you, he came to my house all of a sudden!

594
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,360
 Wow, Lee Hyeon Kyu.

595
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,400
 Was he such a straightforward kind of guy?

596
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,980
 Time changes people.

597
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:06,680
That's not what's important. Who's the one that told him my address?

598
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,940
 It wasn't me.

599
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:10,760
Who else came to my house with you?

600
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:50,540
 Going up.

601
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:52,740
You said you had something to say.

602
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,270
Yes.

603
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:57,000
Go ahead.

604
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,670
Let's talk upstairs.

605
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:06,200
Hyung, do you know Na Ji Na?

606
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,940
Yeah.

607
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:17,680
That's it?

608
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,170
Let's talk upstairs.

609
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:37,080
I have somewhere to go.

610
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:51,980

611
00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:01,520

612
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,230

613
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,330
Hello?

614
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:06,110
 Where are you?

615
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:07,290
Who–

616
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:09,010
 It's me, Hyeon Kyu.

617
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:11,740
What? How did you know my number?

618
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:13,930
 I'll explain in person. Let's meet right now.

619
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:16,860
Right now? I'm not at home right now.

620
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:18,910
 Where are you?

621
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:21,630
I'm at the laundromat in front of my house.

622
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:31,160
- What are you doing– 
 - Are you seeing anyone right now?

623
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,070
- What? 
 - Are you seeing anyone right now?

624
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:36,530
- No, but– 
 - How about someone you like?

625
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:39,560
Even if you do, date me.

626
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:46,030
No matter who that person is, I met you first and I liked you first.

627
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:51,770
And because I still like you.

628
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,290
It's uncomfortable in many ways since we're not living together.

629
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:35,160
That's right.

630
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,920
Since it's done, I'm leaving.

631
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:54,290
Why? Do you not want to let go?

632
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:01,040
What if...

633
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:05,260
♫  You who doesn't wither  ♫

634
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:07,320
What if...

635
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:13,910
if I say I want to live longer, can you grant me that?

636
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:18,020
♫  In my cold heart  ♫

637
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,440
No.

638
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,120
I can't do that. Since I'm Doom.

639
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,600
Okay.

640
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,230
I knew you would say that.

641
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:35,000
I just asked you once.

642
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,360
♫  Don't be anxious  ♫

643
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,550
♫  Even if it's a road with a definite end  ♫

644
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:42,810
You heard, right?

645
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:47,170
What everybody is thinking on the inside.

646
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:50,280
While looking at me,

647
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,370
people are all smiling like that, but

648
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:57,510
on the inside,

649
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:00,190
they are all in pain. Right?

650
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,120
As much as me.

651
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,200
Even more than me.

652
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,440
♫  It's so precious  ♫

653
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,710
♫  Please remember them  ♫

654
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:12,510
Yeah.

655
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:15,620
♫  Even if they all disappear  ♫

656
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:19,250
How about you?

657
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:27,570
What do you think about when you look at me?

658
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,060
Do you think I don't know?

659
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:36,380
You keep... You keep telling me to live,

660
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:39,050
calling me out to live.

661
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:44,530
With your eyes that looks as if they are dead,

662
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:52,490
how do you think I feel when I see you with them?

663
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:57,930
Like you thought earlier, you just have to do that.

664
00:54:57,930 --> 00:54:59,800
It's simple.

665
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:05,720
Leave.

666
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:38,680
In the past, the flowers were a sight to see.

667
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,640
Now, the flowers don't bloom anymore.

668
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:44,240
It's dying.

669
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,100
Just like us.

670
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:54,980
You and I, we are both dying.

671
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,690
We're all like that. Living creatures.

672
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:05,710
I thought I could always see them,

673
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:09,310
but now that I can't, I'm disappointed.

674
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:11,960
The flowers were so pretty.

675
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:23,770
 What do you think about when you look at me?

676
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:31,270
 I thought that I could always look over those who disappear.

677
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:45,000
 Eat like them, sleep like them,

678
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:51,300
 feel sympathy for them, and love them.

679
00:56:53,850 --> 00:56:58,350
 Is this what it means to be headed somewhere, like them?

680
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:22,860
 I'm not afraid of disappearing,

681
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:38,420
♫  Here with me, when your eyes brush past me  ♫

682
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:42,440
  I am afraid that I can no longer see you.

683
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:47,000
♫  I stand alone at that same spot   ♫

684
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:54,340
♫   Here with me, even today   ♫

685
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:59,070
♫  I still believe  ♫

686
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:06,420
 Like a fool, I just realized.

687
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:11,020
 To me, not much time is left.

688
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:16,630
Why are you like this? Did something happen?

689
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:21,850
♫  I hear a low sound, it's you  ♫

690
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:25,780
♫  It's you who held onto me  ♫

691
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:27,720
I love you.

692
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:36,380
I... am in love with you.

693
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:41,420
♫  I wanna be with you  ♫

694
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:44,500
♫  At the end of a tiring day  ♫

695
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:48,200
♫  Without a sound, come to me  ♫

696
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,510
♫  And hug me  ♫

697
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:59,200
♫  Wait for me at the end of this road  ♫

698
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:04,640
♫  My feelings for you can't be hidden  ♫

699
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:10,620
♫   I wanna be with you   ♫

700
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:14,030
♫  Now at least you know a little bit  ♫

701
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:15,370
♫  What I feel for you  ♫

702
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:19,610

703
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:22,810
 I decided to date him.

704
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:26,500
 Are you still feeling lonely and desolate?

705
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,530
 Not anymore. You came back.

706
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:32,570
 Hey, I forbid you from looking at me with those eyes.

707
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:35,370
 It seems like he's been glaring in this direction since earlier.

708
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:38,510
 You open your eyes as if you're a dog protecting its owner.

709
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:41,100
 I told Ji Na.

710
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:43,090
 Don't answer it.

711
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:45,110
 I have something to say.

712
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:49,800
 Love her as much as you want... and live.

713
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:54,070
 I want to make a wish. My birthday wish. Do you want to get married?

714
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:58,440
♫  I wanna be with you  ♫

715
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:02,120
