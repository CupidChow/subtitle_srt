00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,820
(Spring 2024, Beijing)

4
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,700
What do you wanna eat?

5
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,460
Anything spicy is okay.

6
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,230
Zihao.

7
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,180
A word?

8
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,180
Hold this for me. Thanks.

9
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:05,990
Sure.

10
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,260
What's the matter, Yatian?

11
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,510
Is this you?

12
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,100
(Tong Leyi's weibo)

13
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,630
Yes.

14
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,660
Don't get me wrong...

15
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,600
I was helping my friend...

16
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,790
This is not my business.

17
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,750
But we've been friends for many years.

18
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,260
I feel the need to remind you.

19
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,260
She's getting dragged online.

20
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,470
The fashion industry is messy.

21
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,350
I think it's better if you...

22
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,070
Su Zihao.

23
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,470
Who is she?

24
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,510
Leyi.

25
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,510
I'm Zihao's friend, Chen Yatian.

26
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,790
Chen Yatian, I see.

27
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,470
I'm your fan.

28
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,420
I follow you on Red Note.

29
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,030
Your daily outfits are stunning.

30
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,140
Thank you.

31
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,750
Finally, I got to see you in person.

32
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,260
Can I take a photo with you?

33
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,260
Sure, no problem.

34
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,540
Zihao, can you help us out?

35
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,380
Sure.

36
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,910
We can take a selfie.

37
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,790
Don't need my boyfriend.

38
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,420
Boyfriend?

39
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,350
We're going for a date. Bye.

40
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,790
Is she your crush?

41
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,660
From today on,

42
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,230
she should notice you.

43
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,580
Hold on. Make it clear.

44
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,310
When did I become your boyfriend?

45
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,140
Now.

46
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,750
I'm shooting a 24-hour dating special.

47
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,140
I need a boyfriend.

48
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,950
Why me again?

49
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,750
What?

50
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,140
You don't want to?

51
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,260
Yatian, want some fruit?

52
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,510
What's wrong? What are you looking at?

53
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,380
I'd love to.

54
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:38,950
Let's go.

55
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,580
(Spring 2009)
We're already here.

56
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,190
- Be good.
- No.

57
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,420
(Beijing)
I'm not going.

58
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,030
Why not?

59
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,380
I don't need to see a doctor.

60
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,420
- I know what my illness is.
- Be good, please.

61
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,100
Reverb finally managed to get

62
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,980
you this expert.

63
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,070
The doctor's really famous.

64
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,660
Just check it out. It won't hurt.

65
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,070
It won't cause you any pain.

66
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,820
It's fine, ma'am.

67
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,630
Just tell me directly.

68
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,660
I know what kind of illness I have.

69
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,950
We've been through despair.

70
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,950
We're mentally prepared.

71
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,420
What's there to despair
about gallstones?

72
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,820
- Gallstones?
- Gallstones?

73
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,550
Right.

74
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,310
Well,

75
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,880
I'll prescribe you some medication.

76
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,110
Take it for now.

77
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,580
I'll prescribe

78
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,070
about 50 yuan of medication.

79
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,190
Then, I'll schedule a minor surgery.

80
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,260
And that's it.

81
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,380
Daji,

82
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,140
other than cancer, you have gallstones.

83
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,870
I don't want to treat it.

84
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,780
It's pointless.

85
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,070
You only have gallstones. No cancer.

86
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,070
Well, ma'am.

87
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,990
You may not know.

88
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,380
I have bile duct cancer.

89
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,580
It's gallbladder cancer.

90
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,990
Gallbladder cancer.

91
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,070
Show me

92
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,380
your medical records.

93
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,700
Quick.

94
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:50,990
Show it to the doctor.

95
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,750
It's written there.

96
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,380
Gallbladder cancer.

97
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,630
My goodness.

98
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,700
You're not local, are you?

99
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,510
This isn't a proper hospital.

100
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,990
This is a complete misdiagnosis.

101
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,020
All right.

102
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,700
Take my report for medication

103
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,260
and get admitted for treatment.

104
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,260
It's only gallstones!

105
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,020
You're fine!

106
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,070
I can live!

107
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,070
Daji can live!

108
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,380
I'm fine!

109
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,140
Zhou Shui.

110
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,020
I've made up my mind.

111
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,510
I want to frame this gall...

112
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,070
No.

113
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,550
I want to frame this film

114
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,900
and hang it up at home.

115
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,310
Why?

116
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,380
From now on,

117
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,230
it will be my determination
to stay in Beijing.

118
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,870
We have to live well

119
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,380
and love well.

120
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,140
What's wrong?

121
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,670
You're not leaving, right?

122
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,070
No, I'm not leaving.

123
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,020
I have something important to do.

124
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,380
What is it?

125
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,750
("Such a Good Love" First Draft)

126
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,750
I'm submitting this script
for competition.

127
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,550
What's with that look?

128
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,140
Did you forget?

129
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,460
You actually forgot?

130
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,950
Don't turn away.

131
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:28,580
Good.

132
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,900
Almost done. Final touch.

133
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,550
Okay.

134
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,220
Fix your hair a bit.

135
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,110
Perfect.

138
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,870
Hi, I'm Tong Leyi.

139
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,020
This is my 24-hour Love Diary.

140
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,310
First mission.

141
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,310
Take a selfie together.

142
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,110
- Wait.
- It looks good.

143
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:52,630
Next.

144
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,380
Wait.

145
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,770
Here you go.

146
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,380
- Thank you.
- Second love mission.

147
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,900
Share a roasted sweet potato.

148
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,070
Third love mission.

149
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,700
Hold hands and run across

150
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,820
the street together.

151
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,510
Remember what I just said.

152
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,310
Okay.

153
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,070
Ready?

154
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,670
Okay.

155
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,310
Three, two, one.

156
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:15,950
Run.

157
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,190
Faster.

158
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,630
Isn't this the place

159
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,670
where Zhou Shui and Daji separated?

160
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,900
It's like a Chiung Yao drama.

161
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,310
What's a Chiung Yao drama?

162
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,580
You don't know?

163
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,260
Are we from different generations?

164
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,220
Then how many years apart
are we from them?

165
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,070
That's why sometimes

166
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,380
when I watch them,

167
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,700
I can't understand

168
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,630
what they're thinking.

169
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,460
Of course, you can't.

170
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,070
Come here. Let's take a photo.

171
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,220
Again?

172
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,950
Don't go too far away.

173
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,700
No.

174
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,580
Relax. I'm not afraid.

175
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,310
Don't be afraid.

176
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,020
Don't go.

177
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:19,340
(Operation Area 1)

178
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,460
Waiting gave me time to think.

179
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,030
Two years ago, I was so naive

180
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,860
that I believed I could conquer Beijing.

181
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,030
Looking back now, it was foolish.

182
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,430
Once she comes out
of the operating theater,

183
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,310
everything will start over.

184
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,620
I'll work hard

185
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,950
to make money.

186
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,500
The least I can do
is make her feel secure in Beijing.

187
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,580
Daji.

188
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,910
Daji.

189
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,460
How was the surgery?

190
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,750
She just woke up from anesthesia.

191
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,430
She might have a problem breathing.

192
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,700
Keep an eye on her.

193
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,100
Make sure she doesn't fall asleep

194
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,190
for at least an hour.

195
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,980
Understood?

196
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,150
Okay, thank you.

197
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,070
How do you feel?

198
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,500
Does it hurt? No, right?

199
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,430
Dai Daji.

200
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,190
Look at me.

201
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,270
What?

202
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,790
Nothing.

203
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,740
Just make sure you don't sleep.

204
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,220
Daji.

205
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,190
Dai Daji.

206
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,460
Daji.

207
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,310
Hmm.

208
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,190
Daji.

209
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,430
Daji.

210
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,390
The bullet comments are saying
that we're a sweet couple.

211
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,550
Sweet enough to make me
want to fall in love.

212
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,070
Really?

213
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,100
I mean, the bullet comments.

214
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,550
You scared me.

215
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,980
But when it comes to love,

216
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,700
if it is only sweet moments,

217
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,670
I don't mind dating a guy.

218
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,550
Don't we hate love?

219
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,910
I think people don't hate love itself.

220
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,670
They just hate

221
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,030
all the unpleasant things in love.

222
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,310
If

223
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,820
I get sick like Daji did one day,

224
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,550
I still hope

225
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,700
someone like Zhou Shui
will be by my side.

226
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,860
So

227
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,790
you want to start dating someone

228
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,460
or not?

229
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:50,950
How about this?

230
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,460
Instead of dating someone,

231
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,030
let's ship "Scandalous Couple".

232
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,310
Do you agree?

233
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,740
Sure.

234
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,390
Let's go.

235
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,820
Friends.

236
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,430
(Summer 2009, Beijing)
Here it comes.

237
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,660
What is this?

238
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,660
What is this?

239
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,180
Daji.

240
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,070
Good stuff.

241
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,820
What is this, Zhou Shui?

242
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,980
Put it down.

243
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,790
- Put it down.
- Careful.

244
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,550
It's an air conditioner!

245
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,980
A gift for you
on your second anniversary in Beijing.

246
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,700
It's for me?

247
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,500
How do we install it?

248
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,550
Let's see.

249
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,550
Let's see.

250
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,910
Come. Last step.

251
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,150
A little higher.

252
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,378
- Higher. Just a bit.
- A bit.

253
00:11:27,378 --> 00:11:28,767
- Higher.
- Up.

254
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:29,620
- Just a bit.
- Up.

255
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,310
No.

256
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,910
Dumbbell's side needs to go up.

257
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,620
How?

258
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,190
Slowly.

259
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:36,460
Is it okay?

260
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,258
- It's okay.
- Lift it a bit.

261
00:11:38,258 --> 00:11:39,200
Three, two, one. Let go.

262
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,220
- Careful with the AC.
- It's better.

263
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:43,460
Final step.

264
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,430
Plug it in.

265
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,310
Careful. Don't get shocked.

266
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:49,860
Jingshu.

267
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,214
It's working.

268
00:11:52,687 --> 00:11:53,910
Cold air.

269
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,190
So refreshing.

270
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,910
Jingshu,

271
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,950
let's run in for five minutes.

272
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,580
Then, turn it off.

273
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,500
To save electricity.

274
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,100
Don't listen to her, Jingshu.

275
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,580
We'll keep it on all night.

276
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,790
You're burning money.

277
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,310
It's all right, Daji.

278
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,670
Just let it run.

279
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,430
We'll pay this month's electricity bill.

280
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,620
Right.

281
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,950
Zhou Shui bought
the air conditioner anyway.

282
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,700
Enjoy it.

283
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,420
I want to enjoyit a little longer.

284
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,100
What?

285
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,980
Running it doesn't mean
we should live badly.

286
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,100
Did you forget how miserable

287
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,100
you were last summer?

288
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:39,980
I bought this

289
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,150
so you can sleep comfortably

290
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:41,980
this summer.

291
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,390
I know.

292
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,460
I'm mad at myself.

293
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,100
Think about it.

294
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,980
If I had gotten my promotion earlier,

295
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,190
my health insurance would
cover 80% of the medical bill.

296
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,550
That way, I can save 8,000

297
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,580
from my 10,000-yuan surgery fee.

298
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,740
That amount

299
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,700
could've paid almost a year's rent.

300
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,100
If we had enough money

301
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,070
to pay

302
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,460
a whole year's rent,

303
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,740
that would feel secure.

304
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,580
HR said they can only promote one person
between Long and me.

305
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,550
What if I don't make it?

306
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,390
Don't talk nonsense.

307
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,190
It must be you,

308
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,790
my shining Daji.

309
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,580
- Got it?
- Really?

310
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,820
Forget the promotion. Come.

311
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,790
Something came to my mind.

312
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,980
- What's it?
- Something fun.

313
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,220
What's it?

314
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,500
Background info.

315
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,470
I went for a wedding video shoot
the other day.

316
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,500
And there was

317
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,740
a relative of the bride.

318
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,390
What happened?

319
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,670
Tell me.

320
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,670
I thought it was a sister

321
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,740
with her younger brother.

322
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,820
Turns out, they were a couple.

323
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,820
- What?
- My goodness!

324
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,700
They were

325
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,910
- hugging and kissing there.
- No way.

326
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,950
It's exciting. Show me.

327
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:47,670
Let me show you.

328
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:49,950
Where are they?

329
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:50,700
Right here.

330
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,430
Ah!

331
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:55,820
Wait.

332
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,190
This is Long and Director Wen.

333
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,150
That guy.

334
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,820
You know him?

335
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,220
It's Long.

336
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:06,860
Long who?

337
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,950
Long.

338
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,070
Who?

339
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:09,740
Long

340
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,030
is the guy I'm interned with.

341
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:13,910
How could it be?

342
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,790
Director Wen always

343
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,980
rolls up the scripts like this

344
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,150
and whacks him.

345
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,820
So something's going on between them.

346
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,670
So spicy.

347
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,340
Wait.

348
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,390
Do you think I still have a chance
to get promoted?

349
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:30,950
Jingshu.

350
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,430
Jingshu, stop it.

351
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,580
Turn it off right now.

352
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,620
We should save electricity.

353
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,740
Jingshu, what are you guys doing?

354
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,590
- Jingshu.
- Zhou Shui gave you the money back?

355
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:40,820
He paid me back

356
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,220
as soon as he had money.

357
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,670
So now you have money
for tuition, right?

358
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,430
I still need to wait
for the student loan.

359
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,100
I borrowed this from someone.

360
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,390
I need to pay it back.

361
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,310
You borrowed?

362
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,860
From who?

363
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,670
A friend.

364
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,740
Which friend?

365
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,670
Just a friend.

366
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,740
Why are you asking?

367
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,430
You're distracting me?

368
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,150
Forget it. Zhou Shui won't stiff me.

369
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,580
Um, Jingshu.

370
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,980
I know I shouldn't ask.

371
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,430
But there's one thing I must tell you.

372
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,190
What's it?

373
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,580
My second uncle

374
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,310
borrowed money

375
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,860
from the wrong person,

376
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,700
and

377
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,030
it ended up in a huge mess.

378
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,030
I just wanna tell you

379
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,740
to be careful.

380
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,980
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

381
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,300

382
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,900
(Account balance: 50,012 yuan)

383
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,670
50,000?

384
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,150
In just half a year.

385
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:44,980
I've made 50,000.

386
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,950
My goodness! This is huge.

387
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,100
After a couple more months,

388
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,070
- it'll be 100,000.
- 100,000!

389
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,620
I've never seen 100,000 in my life.

390
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,670
How tall it would be

391
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,790
to stack the money up?

392
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,670
Maybe this high.

393
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,390
How should we spend it?

394
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,460
Spend it however you want.

395
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,910
Do you want to make a movie?

396
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,340
To be honest,

397
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,980
I didn't think about movies at all.

398
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,030
I was thinking about the rent,

399
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,100
electricity bills,

400
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,950
and taking Daji for some good food.

401
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,340
How could I not think of

402
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,550
movies?

403
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,500
I think

404
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,950
I should've asked that question.

405
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,100
I really want him to make movies,

406
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,580
but ever since I got sick,

407
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,310
I'm just too scared

408
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,820
to support his dream unconditionally.

409
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,220
Why have I become so cautious?

410
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:55,980
Let's save up a bit more.

411
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:56,820
Yeah, right.

412
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,580
Save up a bit more.

413
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,980
When our lives become more stable,

414
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,150
then think about movies.

415
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,790
That's right.

416
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,390
Let's go

417
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,950
have a nice meal.

418
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,430
No. We don't have much time.

419
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,220
What do you mean?

420
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,190
Where are you going?

421
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,020
Didn't I tell you that this morning?

422
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,540
My senior moved into a new house.

423
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,150
He invites us over.

424
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,060
Which senior?

425
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,630
Who else could it be?

426
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,590
Just one. Yang Yiming.

427
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,630
You've met him before.

428
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,590
That one who said
I did wedding video shoots?

429
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,460
Did he? How come I...

430
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,630
Don't act dumb.

431
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:28,220
I'm not. I think he misspoke.

432
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,540
He probably didn't mean it.

433
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,190
Let's go

434
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,830
meet him.

435
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,300
Yiming, your house is spacious.

436
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,350
It must be over
100 square meters, right?

437
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:43,740
No.

438
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,150
The registered area is 92,

439
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,020
but in reality,
it's only a little over 80.

440
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,910
That's still pretty big.

441
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,670
Besides, the flooring

442
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,220
looks fancy.

443
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:53,980
Of course.

444
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,830
It's imported pure natural wood.

445
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,390
Each plank is over 50 years old.

446
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:04,630
I love the sense of history.

447
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,830
Come and take a look over here.

448
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,110
Zhou Shui.

449
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,430
The bathroom

450
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,780
is bigger than where we're living.

451
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,110
Yiming, you like writing calligraphy?

452
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,540
How much's the rent here?

453
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,950
He bought this place.

454
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,670
He's now a local.

455
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,300
I took a loan. It's not expensive.

456
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,020
Really?

457
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,740
May I ask how much per square meter?

458
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,590
Take a guess.

459
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,150
I guess?

460
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,590
It must be high.

461
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,060
3,000?

462
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,670
- That's exaggerated.
- 3,000?

463
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,110
I'll give you one word.

464
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,300
Look.

465
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:58,670
Naive.

466
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,500
Anyway, you write well.

467
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,300
Take it.

468
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,670
This is the Third Ring Road in Beijing.

469
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,910
It's at least 10,000 per square meter.

470
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:07,670
How much?

471
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,150
- 10,000?
- 10,000?

472
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,590
Blimey!

473
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,190
Hold it well. Don't let it smudge.

474
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,110
A tiny space as big as this paper

475
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,260
costs 10,000?

476
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,910
And that doesn't include
the renovation.

477
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,770
You see, then it'd be

478
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,700
at least 2,000
to 3,000 per square meter.

479
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,500
Oh, right.

480
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,190
The guy who did my renovation
is reliable.

481
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,110
I'll introduce you to him.

482
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:28,980
Come and sit.

483
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,390
When you're ready for renovation,

484
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,060
he can give you a discount.

485
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,910
We're renting right now.

486
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,460
Yes.

487
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,630
We don't need a renovation.

488
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,260
Right.

489
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:45,110
Director Zhou, take my advice.

490
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,630
I've been drinking with my friends.

491
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,910
They told me

492
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,500
the real estate prices in Beijing

493
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,300
are only going up.

494
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,150
Is it?

495
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,950
But I can't afford it now.

496
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,500
We're still working on it.

497
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,670
Effort is one thing.

498
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,110
You can learn from me.

499
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,110
Take a loan.

500
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,460
Look at my place.

501
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,190
The down payment is only 400,000.

502
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:14,670
I suppose you can afford that,
Director Zhou.

503
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,700
If it's not enough,

504
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,350
I can lend you some.

505
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,700
Do you have work insurance and benefits?

506
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,020
That can cover most of the loan.

507
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,300
Right?

508
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,110
Look,

509
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,980
paying rent to the landlord every month

510
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,350
is just a waste,

511
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,430
isn't it?

512
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,220
That's true.

513
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:39,950
Yes.

514
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,500
Don't tell me you don't even have
the insurance thing?

515
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,110
Is that even a legitimate company?

516
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,260
Uh. Oh, right.

517
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,220
Zhou Shui, hurry up.

518
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,110
Take out the gift.

519
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:52,430
Yes.

520
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,260
It's a housewarming gift.

521
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,780
Why did you buy this?

522
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,540
What a waste of money.

523
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,460
Not at all.

524
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,350
It's not much money.

525
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,540
Let me show you this.

526
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,190
Okay.

527
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,500
Come.

528
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,430
Take this.

529
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,260
- No.
- Take it.

530
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,740
This isn't appropriate, Yiming.

531
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,300
Don't be shy.

532
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,870
They're from my friends.

533
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,300
I don't eat this stuff.

534
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,390
- Two more here.
- Uh...

535
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,780
It's too much, Yiming.

536
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,300
Take your chocolate back too.

537
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,670
I should thank you instead.

538
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:28,520
I can't eat all of it.

539
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,500
Help me out.

540
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,670
Let me know

541
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,110
if you need anything.

542
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,300
Don't be shy.

543
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,260
Thank you, Yiming.

544
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,460
Thank you, Yiming.

545
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:44,980
Quick.

546
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,020
Quick.

547
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,700
Come on in. Put them on the table.

548
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:54,950
I've never seen

549
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,220
so much chocolate in my life.

550
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,950
Maybe we can give this small box
to Dong,

551
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,780
the heart-shaped one
to Dumbbell and Jingshu,

552
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,390
and the squared one to Glasses and Vest.
What do you think?

553
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:06,740
Okay.

554
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,390
What's wrong?

555
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,060
Nothing.

556
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,540
Are you okay?

557
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,260
Are you okay?

558
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:17,980
Nothing. I'm good.

559
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,390
You don't look happy.

560
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,500
I'm happy.

561
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,590
Are you?

562
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,740
Smile.

563
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,500
You don't like you're happy.

564
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,430
What's going on?

565
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,700
You were complimenting everything

566
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,980
when we were in Yiming's place.

567
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,350
Do you really think his house is nice?

568
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,980
Oh, please. We're guests.

569
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,780
Of course, I have to say nice things.

570
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,590
I was just being polite.

571
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,220
I don't think so.

572
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,300
It felt like you really thought

573
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,150
his house was better than ours.

574
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:56,700
Yeah.

575
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,700
That's the truth. His house

576
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,020
is better than ours.

577
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,830
The house is big.

578
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,700
Of course, it's better than ours.

579
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,350
Yes, our house is smaller,

580
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,350
but apart from that,
what else is better?

581
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,430
What's that?

582
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:13,460
The wall peels off.

583
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,910
What a good timing.

584
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,950
Yes, the ceiling is a bit off.

585
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,740
But other than that, it's not too bad.

586
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,780
I know what you're saying.

587
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,150
But no matter how big it is, that's his.

588
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,300
Our house may be small,

589
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,780
but it's ours, right?

590
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,060
Daji,

591
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,980
a year ago, I told you

592
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,190
we'd move into a place
with a private bathroom,

593
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,700
fridge, and air conditioning.

594
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,630
But now, we're still living here.

595
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,430
What's the big deal?

596
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,980
I'm happy here.

597
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,390
Because we're here.

598
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,540
This is our home,

599
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,110
so I'm contented.

600
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,190
Besides,

601
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,910
we're not the same as before.

602
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,220
We have 50,000 in our account.

603
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,150
It's 50,000!

604
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,190
We're rich.

605
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:26,430
Super rich.

606
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,630
50,000 doesn't make us rich.

607
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,740
Just enough to buy two floorboards.

608
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,350
It's five.

609
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,350
Five floorboards.

610
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,190
Why do we have to buy floorboards?

611
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,260
(Our country's GDP)

612
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,640
(is 13986.2 billion)

613
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,980
(a year-in-one increase of 7.1%.)

614
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,020
Brat,

615
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,590
why are you still here?

616
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,230
I filmed two short videos
the other day.

617
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,740
I need to edit and submit them.

618
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,060
You've been working hard lately.

619
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,780
You work late every day. Good job.

620
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:01,980
Not at all.

621
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,830
It just feels kind of meaningless.

622
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,300
What job has a meaning?

623
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,780
What I do now

624
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,830
has nothing to do with movies.

625
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,630
I work finger-to-bone
just to make peanuts.

626
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,700
What can I do with it in Beijing?

627
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,430
Brat,

628
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,980
you want to make money, right?

629
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,870
Join me.

630
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:30,830
Let's go.

631
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,950
Let's eat something good.
No instant noodles.

632
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,190
I have some ideas for you.

633
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,950
What happened? Care to share?

634
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,350
Let me ask you a question.

635
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,060
How to

636
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:52,060
buy an apartment in Beijing?

637
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,950
Your girlfriend asks you for a house?

638
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:56,870
Not her.

639
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,870
It's me.

640
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,910
I've been here for so long,

641
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,150
and I still can't afford a decent place
for her.

642
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,670
People mock me for that.

643
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,300
Who mocked you?

644
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,260
That's not important.

645
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,540
It's very important.

646
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,300
Tell me. Let me analyze it for you.

647
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,190
I went to her senior's place
a few days ago.

648
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:26,910
His house...

649
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,430
Better than mine?

650
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,950
No.

651
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,220
If it's like yours,

652
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,390
I wouldn't even care.

653
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,830
His place makes me think

654
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,020
that if I work harder

655
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,630
or get lucky,

656
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,460
Daji and I can live
in a place like that.

657
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,670
And you know what?

658
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:49,150
The thing that gets me
is why someone like him

659
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,350
lives there,

660
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,460
but I can't.

661
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,020
- He looks...
- Jealous.

662
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,430
I'm jealous?

663
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,350
I'm not.

664
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,260
A man like him? No way.

665
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,500
Just wondering

666
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,190
why it is possible for him

667
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,870
to live in a house like that,

668
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,460
but Daji and I can't.

669
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,350
You know why?

670
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,590
Because you don't understand Beijing.

671
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,390
What do you think of this place?

672
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,950
In Beijing,

673
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,950
hard work, suffering, and talent

674
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,700
are important.

675
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,350
But to succeed,

676
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,540
you need luck.

677
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,150
It's impossible to be like them

678
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:48,870
just with what you're doing now.

679
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,020
Then what should I do?

680
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:57,870
Keep this to yourself.

681
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,020
Join me in private equity.

682
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,500
You keep talking

683
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,980
about private equity every day.

684
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,220
What is that, really?

685
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,870
You don't need to know.

686
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:12,980
Just know

687
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,150
that a few hours of that

688
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,150
can make way more than a lifetime

689
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,190
in wedding video shoots.

690
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,460
That good?

691
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,260
Have you made money from it?

692
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,590
I bought this house.

693
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,780
When the opportunity comes,

694
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:34,190
money follows.

695
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,260
You're lucky.

696
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,430
The next good opportunity
is coming in a few days.

697
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:40,980
Are you down

698
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,500
on this?

699
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:47,780
I think I'll pass.

700
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,020
I know nothing about this.

701
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,700
You don't need to.

702
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,190
Just give me your money.

703
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,500
I'll take you through
the financial market.

704
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,710
If we put in one million,

705
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,430
one, ten, hundred,
thousand, ten thousand,

706
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,980
hundred thousand, million, ten million,

707
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,630
we'll get ten million.

708
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,430
Wait.

709
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,390
Stop kidding, please.

710
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,830
One million?

711
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,950
I can't even put together

712
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:11,910
100,000 for you.

713
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,060
It's fine. you can invest
whatever you have.

714
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,020
If you don't have it,

715
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,430
you have at least 50,000, right?

716
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,190
Wait. If this is such a great deal,

717
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,630
why do you need my money?

718
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,390
Listen.

719
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,190
I've put in everything I have,

720
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,540
but to unlock the biggest interest,

721
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,150
I'm short a little.

722
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:30,830
Give me a little push.

723
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,460
Just a little.

724
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,220
The money will be ours.

725
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,020
I can't.

726
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,630
I'm just going to stick
with the wedding video shoot.

727
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,700
- That makes money.
- Brat.

728
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,830
Do you actually like

729
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,020
doing wedding video shoots?

730
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,350
What kind of question is that?

731
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,980
Of course not. I want to make movies.

732
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,190
Then that's it.

733
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,830
Do you want to buy a house in Beijing

734
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,390
like your senior did?

735
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,260
You'd have to stick
with it for ten years,

736
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,220
twenty years, or even a lifetime.

737
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,020
Think with your brain,

738
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,390
Director Zhou.

739
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,060
Do you still want to make movies?

740
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,870
Do you want to be successful?

741
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,540
Is this really the life you want?

742
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,630
If this deal goes through,

743
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:32,460
I'll shut down the wedding
planning company

744
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,150
and turn it into a film company.

745
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,830
The first I'll invest in will be yours.

746
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,190
You said you want to buy a house.

747
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:39,430
Get one near the Third Ring Road.

748
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,110
No one will look down

749
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,430
or mock you by then.

750
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,670
You're very confident, huh?

751
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:54,220
Don't ask me. Ask yourself.

752
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,150
Do you want to be a director?

753
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:56,910
Yes.

754
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,150
Do you want Daji
to live in a nice house?

755
00:30:59,150 --> 00:30:59,590
Yes.

756
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,980
Do you want to be successful?

757
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,500
Yes.

758
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,700
Then just do it.

759
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,430
Just do it!

760
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:03,980
Do it!

761
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,260
Just do it, right?

762
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,260
Yeah.

763
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,870
I want to be a director.

764
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:08,730
I want to make movies.

765
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,540
I want Daji to have a nice house.

766
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,150
Right.

767
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,390
I have 50,000 in my account.

768
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,740
I'll give it to you.

769
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:17,870
Brat,

770
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,390
cheers.

771
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,350
Can I trust you, Reverb?

772
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,870
You know me well.

773
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,950
It's all in this drink.

774
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,020
Let's just do it!

775
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:39,500
I'm about done.

776
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:41,430
I need to go.

777
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,390
Daji is waiting for me at home.

778
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,190
Brat.

779
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,780
Can you hug me?

780
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,590
It's been so long
since anyone hugged me.

781
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,390
Sober up.

782
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:04,980
I'm off.

783
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,300
Wait for my news.

784
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,540
This piece is big.

785
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,260
Take it.

786
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,630
It's for you.

787
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:21,950
Sweet.

788
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,500
Yummy.

789
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,150
How is it?

790
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:23,980
Delicious.

791
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,630
It must be expensive.

792
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,430
Five cents for half a kilo.

793
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:29,220
Perfect.

794
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,590
Everyone's here.

795
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,630
Daji, I have something
to discuss with you.

796
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:33,950
Go ahead.

797
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,300
I need some money.

798
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,060
Take it.

799
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,500
We have 50,000 in our account.

800
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,830
Use whatever you want.

801
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,630
That much? 50,000?

802
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,700
How much do you need?

803
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,390
Really?

804
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,300
50,000.

805
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,980
That's all we have. You want it all?

806
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,460
What is it for?

807
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,430
Don't worry, Daji.

808
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,500
It's definitely something worth it.

809
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,020
I thought it was something serious.

810
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,220
No problem.

811
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,780
If you need it, I'll support you fully.

812
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:05,830
You support me fully?

813
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,020
- Of course.
- That's easy?

814
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:08,350
Thank you, Daji.

815
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,910
I know it's for making a movie.

816
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,980
Why are you hesitating?

817
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,110
Director,

818
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,540
why did you hesitate?

819
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,540
50,000.

820
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,290
A small production.

821
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,060
If it's for a movie,
we'll all support you.

822
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,350
Right, guys?

823
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,110
Of course!

824
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,260
Of course. Is 50,000 enough?

825
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,700
If not, they can pitch in a little.

826
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,910
- There are mosquitoes.
- Didn't you say you'd support him?

827
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:27,950
What did you say again?

828
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,740
- Mosquitoes.
- It's not for making a movie.

829
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,060
Not that?

830
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,590
Stop eating already.

831
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,230
Did you forget
to turn off your computer?

832
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,670
You're not eating?

833
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:43,260
Let's go.

834
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:43,670
No.

835
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,780
Chives, have some more.

836
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,430
So what is this about?

837
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,060
I... I want to invest.

838
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,950
Invest? What do you mean?

839
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,140
Two days ago,

840
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,540
I talked to Reverb.

841
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,870
She's got this private equity project,

842
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,580
and she asked me
if I wanted to put some money in.

843
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,950
Private? Wait. I don't get it.

844
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:21,950
What is that?

845
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,390
Don't worry.

846
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,390
Anyway, it's something

847
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,430
that makes money.

848
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,350
All we have to do
is to put in 50,000,

849
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,180
and we'll make five
or ten times the return.

850
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,660
You're an artist.

851
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,500
When did you start caring about
making money?

852
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,580
What do you even know
about private equity?

853
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,230
I don't,

854
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,660
but I can learn, Daji.

855
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:40,580
Look.

856
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,580
Don't worry, anyway.

857
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,140
Just give 50,000 to Reverb,

858
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,140
and she'll handle it.

859
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,330
We don't have to do anything.

860
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,230
We just wait for the money to roll in.

861
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:48,830
No.

862
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:50,790
This isn't investing.

863
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:51,980
This is committing suicide.

864
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:52,870
What you're doing now

865
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,350
is basically killing yourself.

866
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,560
- Understand?
- No, it's not.

867
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,580
This equity will make money.

868
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,430
You have to believe me.

869
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,660
I can't.

870
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,580
How can I believe you?

871
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,840
50,000 is all we have.

872
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,790
If we invest everything

873
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,640
and lose it,

874
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,460
- how could we
- No.

875
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,460
- survive?
- Daji, look.

876
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,750
Let me analyze it for you.

877
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,870
I don't want to listen.

878
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,490
Anyway, I disagree with this.

879
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,230
If it's for a movie, yes.
Anything else? No.

880
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,140
Daji, I...

881
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,390
I just want to give you

882
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,750
the life you want.

883
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,950
I want you to have a real home
in Beijing.

884
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,390
I want this city to welcome us.

885
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,870
We have a home here.

886
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:25,790
I'm doing just fine.

887
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,350
You're actually destroying the home.

888
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:29,950
Why can't you understand?

889
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,350
How do I not understand?

890
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,020
Well, let me tell you this, Daji.

891
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,830
The real rich people in Beijing

892
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:37,350
don't make their money by working hard.

893
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,270
They invest,

894
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,390
and money just comes in like magic.

895
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:43,270
I just think

896
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,980
that if we have a better life

897
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,350
and want to make money
and live in a nice house,

898
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,540
we have to venture into things

899
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,870
beyond our imagination.

900
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,540
Like private equity and investment.

901
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,350
These are things
we don't even know about.

902
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,830
Actually,

903
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,390
we had many arguments before.

904
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,350
But this was the first time

905
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,350
it scared me.

906
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,950
Not because he was loud,

907
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,160
but because, at that moment,

908
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,870
he suddenly felt like a stranger.

909
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,230
He was saying things
that didn't sound like him.

910
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,620
It was like he had become
a different person.

911
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,140
The Zhou Shui I knew

912
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,620
was getting further
and further away from me.

913
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,830
It was really hot that day.

914
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,980
The lowest temperature was 32 degrees.

915
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,270
But I

916
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:30,980
felt cold.

917
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,350
I think I even heard the sound

918
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,870
of ice cracking.

919
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,830
(When I was at it,)

920
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,500
(we had no idea what was coming next.)

921
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,580
(We didn't know
that once the ice cracks,)

922
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,060
(it never blends back together.)

923
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,790
(It drifts apart and separates.)

924
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:02,420
(Please select a transaction type)

925
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,020
(Reverb)

926
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,660
(Confirm)

927
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,780
(Transfer successful.
Amount 50,000 yuan)

928
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:25,710
Are you busy?

929
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,870
I took many samples back

930
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:31,060
from the ad shooting last time.

931
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,710
There are Estée Lauder

932
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,790
and Lancôme.

933
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,060
You can have them.

934
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,430
You're asking about
your promotion again?

935
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,620
You ask me every day.
Aren't you tired of it?

936
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,270
I haven't heard anything yet.

937
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,540
Then when will it be decided?

938
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,020
I've been an intern for over a year.

939
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,950
Between you and Long,
who's getting promoted,

940
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,460
you should ask Director Wen.

941
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,100
It's her decision.

942
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,100
Reverb!

943
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,230
We are leaving work.

944
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,660
Reverb!

945
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,140
- Mr. Han. That's it.
- Here?

946
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,100
Pack it all up.

947
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,310
- Move.
- Wait.

948
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,830
- Move everything.
- Who are you?

949
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,310
- Move.
- What are you doing?

950
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:09,580
Move!

951
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,010
- What are you doing?
- Who are you?

952
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,180
Where's Reverb?

953
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,830
She hasn't been at the office lately.

954
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:14,620
What do you want?

955
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,590
Lad, Reverb owes us money.

956
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,270
Do you know that?

957
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:17,910
Impossible.

958
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,310
Don't slander her.

959
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,060
We've never owed anyone money.

960
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,230
- Don't touch that.
- Listen.

961
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,830
She lost a ton of money

962
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:25,870
in her private equity.

963
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,140
She owes us three million

964
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,140
and ran off. Take everything. Quick.

965
00:38:29,421 --> 00:38:30,410
Hurry. Move everything.

966
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:31,540
- Don't...
- And this bag.

967
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,580
- Take it.
- No.

968
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,830
- What?
- This is mine.

969
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,270
Give me.

970
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,660
- Stop!
- So what if it's yours?

971
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,580
Listen up.

972
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,710
Everything here is mine.

973
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,230
This is mine.

974
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,660
My girlfriend bought me this camera.

975
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,710
Girlfriend? Take everything.

976
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,350
Everything!

977
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,310
Stop!

978
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,270
(Reverb)
Call her!

979
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:48,270
She owes us money and ran off.
Take everything.

980
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,060
The number you dialed is powered off.

981
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,020
She's not answering either?

982
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,580
I'm telling you.

983
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,060
If we can't find her,
we'll clear out her house.

984
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,100
Hurry up.

985
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,830
What took you so long
to move a chair? Jeez.

986
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,180
So much stuff to move here.

987
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:04,830
Reverb!

988
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,460
Who are you? Why are you barging in?

989
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,500
Who are you?

990
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,580
Who are you looking for?

991
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,870
I'm looking for Reverb.

992
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:13,310
She ran off with debts. Stop looking.

993
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,060
She left her house?

994
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,980
You're funny.

995
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,020
This is not her house.

996
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,020
It's mine, got it?

997
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,390
She's a tenant.

998
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,500
She still owes me months of rent.

999
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,950
Why? Are you paying for her?

1000
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,390
Quick. This is expensive.

1001
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,100
Careful.

1002
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,620
(Beautiful)

1003
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,140
Hello?

1004
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:55,790
Still at work?

1005
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:58,620
Yiming.

1006
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,500
Yes, I'm working overtime.

1007
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,230
Let's go grab something.

1008
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,390
Not today.

1009
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:06,790
Next time, okay?

1010
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,270
I'll buy you supper next time.

1011
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,100
I'm already here.

1012
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,390
Yiming, why are you here?

1013
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,100
Your mom said

1014
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,060
you always work late and skip dinner.

1015
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,660
She asked me to take care of you.

1016
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,910
I'm so annoyed with her now.

1017
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,020
She always bothers you

1018
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,540
to buy me food.

1019
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,100
I don't know how to repay you.

1020
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:24,910
It's nothing.

1021
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:26,660
You're working so hard.

1022
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,180
When will you get promoted?

1023
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,950
Don't bring this up.
It gives me a headache.

1024
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,980
Well, stop working.

1025
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:35,660
Eat first.

1026
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,430
Wait, I...

1027
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,310
Eat first. You can continue that later.

1028
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,100
Come on.

1029
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,310
Okay.

1030
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:43,310
I'll eat first. I'm hungry.

1031
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,950
Here you go.

1032
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,270
Skewer. Thanks, Yiming.

1033
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,060
Have you thought about
getting another job?

1034
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,500
No.

1035
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,180
I've been close with a producer.

1036
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,310
If you want a new job,

1037
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,270
I can put in a word for you

1038
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,350
and get you in.

1039
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,390
For real?

1040
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,910
You don't believe me?

1041
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:08,540
I do.

1042
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,540
I've been in Beijing long enough.

1043
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,710
Getting you a job

1044
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,350
is a piece of cake.

1045
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,870
But I've been working here for so long.

1046
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,620
If I go to a new place now,

1047
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,500
I'd have to start all over again.

1048
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,350
Just straight to a full-time.

1049
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:22,710
Does it come with benefits?

1050
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:23,540
Of course.

1051
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,060
If you work hard for two years,

1052
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,070
you could even get
a Beijing resident permit.

1053
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:27,950
That's wonderful.

1054
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,390
On the last day of July 2009,

1055
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,100
I lost my job.

1056
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,310
The only 50,000 Daji and I had is gone.

1057
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:57,660
She warned me,

1058
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,310
but I didn't listen.

1059
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,620
She was right.

1060
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,310
But how am I supposed to tell her?

1061
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,620
How do I say it?

1062
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,430
Look at this place.

1063
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,020
It's a tiny little pond.

1064
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:30,750
Right?

1065
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,980
I'll take you to the ocean.

1066
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:35,620
Ocean?

1067
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,750
But I'm just a little shrimp.

1068
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,390
The ocean is

1069
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,100
too salty for me.

1070
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,830
I think I'm fine in the pond.

1071
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,910
At least I can struggle a little here.

1072
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,460
Thank you, Yiming. But I'm fine.

1073
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,620
It's all right. Take your time

1074
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,950
and think about it.

1075
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:55,950
Thank you, Yiming.

1076
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:58,460
Hello?

1077
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:01,390
