6
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,409
So you have to be enthusiastic

7
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,459
and passionate.

8
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,520
Got it?

9
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,760
Give us a second.

10
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,769
Wait.

11
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,040
My friend didn't tell me
we'd be selling this stuff.

12
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,360
I don't think we can do this.

13
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,880
This... This doesn't seem very proper.

14
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,849
Forget it.

15
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,760
Well.

16
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,970
How much does it pay?

17
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,779
No base salary.

18
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,250
Twenty yuan commission
for every bottle sold.

19
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,730
Twenty?

20
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,219
Twenty?

21
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,250
Are you down or not?

22
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,345

Tell me about it.

I... I'm not sure.

33

You don't know what you're selling?

34
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,819
I just want to know
if this really helps.

37
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,409
Let me explain. I know all about it.

38
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,529
Have you ever seen

39
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,410
Beijing at 3 AM?

40
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,569
I'm asleep by then.

41
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,969
Exactly.

42
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,099
Take two bottles home,

43
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,880
and I guarantee

44
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,779
you'll see Beijing at 3 AM, mister.

45
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,409
- For real?
- Well, then. I'll take one.

46
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,249
That's not enough.

47
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,379
One will only get you to 1:30 AM.

48
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,320
You need two to see 3 AM.

49
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,730
Give me two.

50
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,379
No rush.

51
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,289
- Daji.
- 100 yuan.

52
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,849
You're surprisingly bold.

53
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:32,339
No choice.

58
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,920
Jingshu,

59
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:07,939
both of us made 200 yuan

60
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,939
in just one day.

61
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,600
A few days more of this, we'll have
enough money to pay the rent.

62
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,200
You've introduced a great gig for me.

63
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,689
There's a little downside.

64
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,890
Those fellows were
saying disgusting things.

65
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,530
You know what?

66
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,539
This kind of money is easy to make

67
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,440
if you don't mind
setting your pride aside.

68
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,890
But I think pride is important.

69
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,290
It means nothing if it's for love.

70
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,170
Zhou Shui is here for you.

71
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,850

72
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,890
Not bad.

73

Zhou Shui!

74

77
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,210
Zhou Shui.

78
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,249
You're off work.

79
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,089
How was your day?

80
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,059
Um... Zhou Shui came to
pick up Daji from work,

81
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,680
and I was worried he'd be walking alone,
so I tagged along.

82
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,240
He's a grown man.
What's there to worry about?

83
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,120
He's worried about your safety.

84
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:23,889
Just tell her.

85
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,129
Don't be shy.

86
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,290
What about you?

87
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,000
Why are you here?

88
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,530
I missed you.

00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,170
- Let's go home.
- Let's go.

91
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,400
There's somewhere I need to be.

92
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,059
It's true. Zhou Shui,
is it something urgent?

93
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,329
- No, you have nothing to do now.
- I really do, Dumbbell.

94
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,440
It's true.

95
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,089
Send Jingshu home.

96
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,209
Please take care of Dumbbell.

97
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,179
Get home safely.

98
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:09,859
Is this okay?

99
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,739
Yes.

100
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,089
Of course.

101
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,330
Take care.

102
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,440
We're in a hurry.

103
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,210
He doesn't have plans, though.

104

Let's go.

105
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,129
You're always busy with school,

106
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,970
why take on so many jobs?

107
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,210
Do you really need money?

108
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,530
Everyone living
in Chunzhili Residence does.

109
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,040
True.

110
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,249
But I think

111
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,730
you're pushing yourself too hard.

112
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,129
I come from a village.

113
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,600
I have a younger brother.

114
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,440
My parents didn't want me
to go to Beijing to study.

115
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,440
They never give me a dime.

116
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,419
My tuition is covered by student loans.

117
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,800
And I have to earn money to pay
my living expenses.

118
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,170
Plus, I have to send money back
every month.

119
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,600
That's tough for you.

120
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,770
No.

121
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,560
Studying in Beijing is my dream.

122
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,680
I'm happy now.

123
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,120
Actually, I'm also happy.

124
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,120
Sorry?

125
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,170
I mean,

126
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,689
everyone came here to chase their dream.

127
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,730
And the entire process

128
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,209
means happiness,

129
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,360
doesn't it?

130
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,240
Then why do you want to become
someone like Schwarzenegger?

131
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,890
My parents passed away when I was a kid.

132
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,560
I'm an orphan.

133
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,560
My uncle raised me.

134
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:42,939
One time,

135
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,330
he took me to a record store
in the county town.

136
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,059
That's where

137
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,730
I met Schwarzenegger.

138
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,440
From then on, I had a dream.

139
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,650
I wanted to be

140
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,090
a strong man like him.

141
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,419
That's great.

142
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,480
Let's strive for our dreams.

143
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,290
Are you heading home now?

144
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,560
Aren't you?

145
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,090
You go back first.

146
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,600
Where are you going?

147
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,040
I...

148
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm going for a run.

149
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,779
Why do you always go running

150
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,410
when I'm home?

151
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,680
Are you afraid of me?

152
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,890
No, it's not that.

153
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,080
I...

154
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,170
I'm afraid I won't be able
to control myself.

155
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,899
See this, Director Zhou?

156
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,130
Two red bills.

157

something great today.

160
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,960
- I'll show you later.
- Sure.

161
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,369

China Film Archive.

164
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,729
This is a holy place
for all Chinese moviemakers.

165
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:14,179
They screen a lot of classic films here.

166
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,449
There's a long line.
There must be a movie playing right now.

Let's go.

169
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,410
What's that?

170
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,019
It's awesome!

- "Pulp Fiction"!
- "Pulp Fiction"!

172
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,899
My favorite!

173
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,720
I haven't watched it yet.

174
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,170
Zhou Shui, look at my outfit.

175
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,200
Mia.

176
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,539

What's more important, money or movies?

186
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:52,969
Wait.

187
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,130
Get in line.

00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,840
(are like a magnet
that keeps pulling me in.)

190
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,290
(It took me many years to realize)

191
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,800
(that I wasn't just romantic hopeless.)

192
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,840
(It was a banner.)

193
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,369
- What does that mean?
- It means

194
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,019
that even though he has his own style,

195
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,960
it's also something everyone can accept.

196
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,360
Especially that dance scene.

197
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,669
- The dance scene.
- What do you think?

198
00:10:46,669 --> 00:10:48,779
- Awesome, right?
- Incredible. This is my first time

199
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,729
watching the two leads dancing
in the original film. It's cool.

200
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,259
We can dance just as well.

201
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,890
Can we?

202
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,200
(Our joy)

203
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,320
(can be found in every street and alley
in Beijing.)

204
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,370
(Back then, we had nothing,)

205
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,329
(but we never bowed our heads.)

(Cordyceps Men's Vitality Tonic)

208
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,899
Daji,

209
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,650
we made 800 yuan in just three days.

210
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:17,449
That's incredible.

211
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,840
You're amazing.

212
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,299
Do you think

213
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,779
I should open my own store?

214
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,089
Maybe I could be rich

215
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,920
and keep a director.

216
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,209
That could work.

217
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,969
Remember to look out for me
when you get rich.

218
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,019
Of course.

219
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,609
I got your back.

220
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,040
All of you.

221
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,569
Hello? What's wrong, Dongting?

222
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,200
You can't reach her?

223
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,130
Jingjing and I are in our dorm.

224
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,920
She's taking a shower.

225
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,200
Okay. Coming.

226
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,489
I need your help now, Daji.

227
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,299
So suddenly?

228
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,410
Let's go.

229
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,720
What's going on? Why are you in a hurry?

230
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,320
Here's what happened.

231
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,329
The girl who rents my bed

232
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,969
is meeting a boy right now, but her boyfriend
is on his way to see her.

233
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:10,779
Wait.

234
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,920
How many people are there?

235
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,490
Three.

236
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,819
No way. No.

237
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,329
You can't help her.

238
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,609
This is a trouble.

239
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,130
If her boyfriend finds out,
he'll kill you.

240
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,530
I don't have a choice.
I did this for her before.

241
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,440
Daji, I need you to pull this off.

242
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,250
Me?

243
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,650
Dongting.

244
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:31,280
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Jingshu. What took you so long?

245
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,939
- Where's Jingjing?
- She's on her period.

246
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,059
She's feeling unwell.

247
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,969
I made her brown sugar tea just now.

248
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,659
Why isn't she picking up my calls?

249
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,849
She's been sleeping.

250
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,610
Her phone is on silent mode.

251
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,680
Jingjing, wave to Dongting.

252
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,899
She asks me to apologize.

253
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,539
She really can't come down today.

254
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,259
I'm so sorry.

255
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:51,729
This...

256
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:52,729
I'll pass it on to her.

257
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:53,819
Okay.

258
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,720
Oh, right.

259
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,179
You missed the Number Theory lecture
last time.

260
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,419
I wrote down the key points
the professor went over.

261
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,610
Remember to read it.
It's going to be in the final.

262
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,290
Thank you.

263
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,179
Jingshu, what's your connection
to Jingjing?

264
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,019
- Why do you have to help her with this?
- Well. She rents my bed in our dorm.

265
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,059
Does that include
her love relationships?

266
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,609
Well, I charge her a high rent.
What if she doesn't rent from me?

267
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,299
You're smart.

268
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,610
Fair enough.

269
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,419
Ma'am.

270
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,179
Where were you?

271
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:24,969
We're sorry.

272
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,299
I had something at school...

273
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,139
Enough. I don't want to hear it.
No commission for you today.

274
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,560
Why?

275
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,449
You two were gone the whole day,

276
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,729
and you still want to get paid?

277
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,059
It wasn't the entire day.

278
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,179
We left at noon.

279
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,939
Besides, we sold a box each
this morning.

280
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,179
You skipped work today,

281
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,419
so you won't get paid.

282
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,720
That's not fair.

283
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,539
We must get what we deserve.

284
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,290
Not a single dime less.

285
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,139
What had I hired, huh?

286
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,089
I hired

287
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,770
two staff.

288
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,689
If you want money, fine.

289
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,689
I'll give you the money.

290
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,449
You don't need to come tomorrow.

291
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,059
- Take it.
- Wait.

292
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,969
Take the money.

293
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,650
No. We...

294
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,250
We're coming back tomorrow.

295
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,569
Hurry up and clean everything up.

296
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,440
I'm so tired.

297
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:10,840
Get moving.

298
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,560
We'll earn it back tomorrow.

299
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:17,779
Hi,

300
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,569
I'm Tong Leyi.

301
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,819
Over 30 premium ingredients
were picked.

302
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,400
A secret recipe from an ancient physician.

303
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,720
(Spring 2024, Beijing)
It helps build health.

304
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,019
Turtle Sage Cordyceps
Men's Vitality Tonic.

305
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,770
It's still selling after so many years?

306
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,610
She...

307
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,080
Hello?

308
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,779
Leyi,

309
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,019
I heard the esports hotel
is upgrading their computers.

310
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,509
They're throwing out
all the hard drives.

311
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:49,720
If we want to keep watching
the video of Zhou Shui and Daji,

312
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,419
we need to swap out the hard drive.

313
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,560
Are you coming?

314
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,200
Give me 30 minutes.

315
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,680
Where are you going?
We're in the middle of a shooting.

316
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,250
Boss.

317
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,080
Is it done?

318
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,899
The hard drive is out.

319
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,089
Let's move.

320
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:05,969
No rush.

321
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,489
I need to put in

322
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,369
a new drive first.

323
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,139
Easy.

324
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,250
Everything is in control.

325
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,059
Who's it?

326
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,059
I'm the manager.

327
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,089
The system shows

328
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,449
that your computer is disconnected.

329
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,329
Stall him.

330
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,720
How?

331
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,849
Can you open the door and let me check?

332
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,440
It's not convenient now.

333
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,530
What's that noise?

334
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,419
- Are you doing something with the computer?
- No.

335
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,890
We're on the bed.

336
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,539
- Hurry up.
- Get dressed. I'm coming in after ten counts.

337
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,139
Hard drive.

338
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,130
Ten, nine,

339
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:46,770
eight,

340
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:47,960
seven,

341
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:48,899
six,

342
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,960
five,

343
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,170
four,

344
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,290
three,

345
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,610
Quick. Leave.

346
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,840
Jerk!

347
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,130
You're texting another woman
lying next to me.

348
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,419
- No, baby.
- Please listen to me. It's not what you think.

349
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,819
No need to explain. Get lost.

350
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,929
I'm so sorry, manager.

351
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,000
Where's the thing?

352
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,410
Right here.

353
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,090
Hurry.

354
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,569
Let's keep watching tomorrow.

355
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,440
Let's go.

356
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,240
That's interesting.

357
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,609
Coming. This is nice.

358
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,050
Beautiful.

359
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,170
Was it a camera movement?

360
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,610
Impressive.

361
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,440
I love that.

362
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,850
- It's good, right?
- Yes.

363
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,200
You're fine taste.

364
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,259
What are you doing?

365
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,459
The heroine is here. Quick.

366
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,739
She's back.

367
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,330
What are you guys watching?

368
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,200
Zhou Shui,

369
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,480
I slaved away to support this family,

370
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:46,240
and you're here watching porn?

371
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,929
- No.
- It's not that.

372
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:48,649
No?

373
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,369
- No.
- Are you guys watching porn?

374
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,059
No, we're not.

375
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,059
Wait, Daji.

376
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,649
Uh...

377
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,200
I'm counting to three.

378
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,920
One.

379
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,089
- No.
- Old man.

380
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,130
Two.

381
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,650
No, we're not watching that.

382
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,890
Dumbbell.

383
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,499
Um...

384
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,890
I think I should go.

385
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,480
Zhou Shui,

386
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,169
you've grown a pair, huh?

387
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,259
Did you convert to
an "action movie" director?

388
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,849
Daji, you got me wrong.

389
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,200
What were you watching?

390
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,960
Show me.

391
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,089
It's not mature yet.

392
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,849
How much more mature
do you want it to be?

393
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:24,609
Show me.

394
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,219
No.

395
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,440
On the count of three.

396
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:29,720
Three.

397
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,330
Now, Daji.

398
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,370
My name is Dai Daji.

399
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,130
My name is Zhou Shui.

400
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,129
On July 5, 2007,

401
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,569
I came to Beijing.

402
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,929
On December 22, 2007,

403
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,499
I came to Beijing.

404
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,459
And then,

405
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,019
- on January 1, 2008,
- This...

406
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,409
at 12 AM,

407
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,650
we fell in love in Beijing!

408
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,810
Are you okay,

409
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,170
pretty?

410
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,370
Your voice is sexy, handsome.

411
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,259
This is me?

412
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,200
This feels like a romance drama.

413
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,480
I like it.

414
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,200
Once I save enough money

415
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,480
and get the certification,

416
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,890
I'll be a real fitness coach.

417
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,680
Don't forget to show Jingshu.

418
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:35,019
I want to be with you,
Daji, Dumbbell together

419
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,499
forever.

420
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,819
That's not realistic.

421
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,929
But I hope

422
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,960
we can live together forever.

423
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,280
Daji,

424
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,649
there's a surprise inside.

425
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,680
Is it?

426
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,410
It's ring candy.

427
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,410
You like it that much?

428
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,170
Then, I'll propose to you with this.

429
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,520
No way.

430
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,370
No?

431
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,200
Actually, it sounds nice.

432
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,170
Even if you propose to me with this,
I'll say yes.

433
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,219
Really?

434
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,219
Are you sure?

435
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,280
You promised.

436
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,680
I was sorting through the footage

437
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,520
to sell to a stock site.

438
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,960
But then I found these.

439
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,059
Now, I don't think

440
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,240
I could ever sell them.

441
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,170
Don't sell them.

442
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,329
These are our memories.

443
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,810
Let's save them

444
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,200
for ten years.

445
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,280
For twenty years.

446
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,170
Forever.

447
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,850
Zhou Shui, your phone.

448
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,410
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

449
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,539
Maybe you should pick up.

450
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,410
Ignore it.

451
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,760
Just pick up.
What if it's something important?

452
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,330
Put it on speaker.

453
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,499
Brat,

454
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,370
why didn't you tell me
that you were in Beijing?

455
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,330
Who are you?

456
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:07,929
Brat,

457
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,089
drop your act.

458
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,050
I'm Reverb.

459
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,090
Come to my house now.

460
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,760
Da... Daji.

461
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:20,520
Brat,

462
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,280
you have a girlfriend now?

463
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,680
Yes.

464
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,369
Hello, I'm Dai Daji.

465
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,129
What's the matter?

466
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,089
It's fine, little sister.

467
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,609
I just want to invite you to my place.

468
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:34,889
I'll send you the address.

469
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,280
Come over right away.

470
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,329
Zhou Shui.

471
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,889
Daji. She's just a big sister
from my hometown,

472
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,539
and that's all.

473
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,680
Trust me.

474
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,570
Is she the one who wants to keep you?

475
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,219
I thought
you were already supporting me.

476
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,800
What if you think I'm not good enough
and want a new sugar mommy?

477
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,760
Do I have that big of an ambition?

478
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,810
I'm not.

479
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,059
Reverb.

480
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,409
(The stock market is gloomy.)

481
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,649
(The real estate market
falls from grace.)

482
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,360
(In 2008, the Chinese stock market
experiences a complete nosedive.)

483
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,280
Reverb.

484
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,680
Brat, why didn't you contact me
when you came to Beijing?

485
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,089
Welcome.

486
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,369
- Is this your house?
- Yes. Let me introduce you.

487
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,259
This is the big sister
from my hometown, Reverb.

488
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,050
We were walking to her on the phone.

489
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,440
This is my girlfriend, Dai Daji.

490
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,739
Hello, I'm Dai Daji.

491
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,459
It was a misunderstanding.

492
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,200
I didn't know you were his friend.

493
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,569
Brat, lucky you.

494
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,499
All your girlfriends are so pretty.

495
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,259
Please come in.

496
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,240
You...

497
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,089
- Do we need to change our shoes?
- No.

498
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,920
We don't do that in the U.S.

499
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,520
This house has just been renovated.

500
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,979
Do you listen to vinyl?

501
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,329
No.

502
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,649
It's very popular now.

503
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:50,089
There are musical instruments here.
You can play if you know.

504
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:51,499
How many floors are there here?

505
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,760
Two.

506
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,650
You really landed on your feet here
in Beijing.

507
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,129
I asked you to come.

508
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,299
You would've succeeded
if you'd come earlier.

509
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,699
I came here to make movies,

510
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,200
not to make money.

511
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,680
Oh, you're still so idealistic.

512
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,280
It kind of takes me back.

513
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,779
Stop it, please.

514
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,200
Where's your boyfriend?

515
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,810
Baby.

516
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,779
Hi, baby.

517
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,299
- Hi, guys.
- Come meet my friends.

518
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,810
- Hi.
- Hi.

519
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,240
It's a foreigner.

520
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,370
His Chinese is great.

521
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,979
- David.
- Baby.

522
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,000
How are you?

523
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:26,779
Hello, guys.

524
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,369
Hi.

525
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,369
Let me introduce.

526
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,819
This is David.

527
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,459
Happy couple.

528
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,929
- Yes. Happiness.
- Happiness.

529
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:35,570
We just met. We are soulmates.

530
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,089
Soulmates.

531
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:39,170
Does it mean an ideally suited partner?
But they don't look like one.

532
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,000
Brat, come and pick a wine for me.

533
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,610
What do you want to drink?

534
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,720
They look all the same to me.
Anything is fine.

535
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,680
All the same?

536
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,410
What do you do for a living?

537
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,480
Me?

538
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,539
Foreign trades, gigs.

539
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,000
I do anything that brings me money.

540
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,219
Didn't you say

541
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,409
you want to conquer Beijing

542
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,459
with your punk spirit?

543
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,280
Why are you after money now?

544
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,329
Only youngsters believe in

545
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,370
unrealistic ideals.

546
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,850
Beijing has taught me a good lesson.

547
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,050
I'm living a practical life now.

548
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,650
Well, whatever works.

549
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,960
Brat,

550
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,699
look at your outfit.

551
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,459
No one will think you're a director.

552
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,499
What's wrong with my outfit?

553
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,849
It's good.

554
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,520
Moviemaking doesn't make money, right?

555
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,160
- Do you need help getting sponsors?
- Mind your own business.

556
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,539
I'll manage.

557
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,680
Fine.

558
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,200
Beijing will teach you a lesson
sooner or later.

559
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,920
Take the glasses.

560
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,849
Let's see if it's Beijing educating me

561
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,259
or me educating Beijing.

562
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,200
Fine.

563
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,480
Daji.

564
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,050
What are you doing here?

565
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,370
Leave me alone.

566
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,040
(Welcome to Beijing)
Are you not happy?

567
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,170
Keep silent. Thank you.

568
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,520
I feel like I need to explain.

569
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,610
Reverb

570
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,440
is really a friend from my hometown.

571
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,130
She brought me to a band before.

572
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,720
But aside from that...

573
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,650
You think I'm that petty?

574
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,059
Can you stop talking?

575
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,169
You're interrupting my thoughts.

576
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,129
You're thinking?

577
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:28,609
Yes.

578
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,000
What are you thinking about?

579
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,499
I shouldn't have brought you
to her place.

580
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,200
No.

581
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,000
You should.

582
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,569
By visiting her house,

583
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,779
I can now know

584
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,810
what kind of house we want
in the future.

585
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,200
No.

586
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:49,130
We want something better.

587
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:51,720
How so?

588
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,480
First of all,

589
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,059
the location has to be good,

590
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:55,779
right?

591
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,889
We can't settle for any place.

592
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,019
I think

593
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,520
we should buy

594
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,499
next to this building.

595
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,779
And the floor

596
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,089
needs to be good as well.

597
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:06,539
Okay.

598
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,299
88th floors.

599
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,369
88th. Straight up to the sky.

600
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,259
One floor isn't enough.

601
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:10,739
No problem.

602
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,499
- Let's get two floors.
- Two floors.

603
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,720
Two floors are ours.

604
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,849
Good.

605
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,169
Next is the bedroom.

606
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,520
The bedroom

607
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,810
will be right here.

608
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,889
Okay. This is our bedroom.

609
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,840
- Our bed needs to be special.
- How special is it?

610
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,699
It's not like two single beds put together.

611
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,569
It's a real double bed.

612
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,170
Let me measure it.

613
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:32,019
One, two, three, four, five,

614
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,090
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

615
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,760
- Ten meters of bed.
- Ten meters of bed.

616
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,129
Let's roll on it.

617
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,850
We'll roll around.

618
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:42,699
Over there.

619
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,810
Right here.

620
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,610
There's a huge floor-to-ceiling window,

621
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:50,200
- and outside, we can see that!
- and outside, we can see that!

622
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,929
- The bathroom will be over there.
- Bathroom. Right here.

623
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,059
There's a huge tub.

624
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,459
Good.

625
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,369
We don't have to wait in line.

626
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,920
Hot water is always available.

627
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:01,779
No need to wait.

628
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,219
Free and unlimited hot water.

629
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,610
That's right.

630
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,649
Here,

631
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,539
the biggest space is our living room.

632
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,649
Living room.

633
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:10,699
How big is it?

634
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,920
Let me feel it.

635
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,050
Measure it.

636
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,499
Three, four.

637
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,920
- How big?
- How big?

638
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:31,000
- 240 square meters.
- 240 square meters.

639
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,499
I want to cover all the walls and floor

640
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,979
in the living room

641
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,929
with your movie posters.

642
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,299
Can I place a display case here?

643
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:38,819
Yes.

644
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,649
Look.

645
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,059
Golden Bear, Golden Lion, Palme d'Or,

646
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,499
Cannes, Berlin, and Busan awards!

647
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,330
- The case isn't enough.
- I'll win them all.

648
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:53,019
- Careful. The elevator isn't fully fixed yet.
- This is our home elevator.

705
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,170
This is the God of Matchmaking Temple.
It's for praying for love.

706
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,299
Sorry to disturb.

707
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:20,889
I'm so sorry.

00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,739
- Sorry.
- Hurry up and go.

709
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,499

to the God of Matchmaking.

711
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,699

712
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,979

713
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,849
Maybe you'll marry a guy
a few days later.

714
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:31,739
Don't curse me.

715
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,130
My career is taking off right now.

716
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,200
I don't want any distractions.

717
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,569
I read a post on a forum this morning.

718
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,369
Someone asked

719
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,610
why people stop dating anymore.

720
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,259
It costs money.

721
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,680
You have to pay for meals, shopping,

722
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,569
and gifts for Valentine's Day.

723
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:56,129
Even if you're stingy, you still have to
get something for your girlfriend's birthday.

724
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,409
Not only does it cost money,

725
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:00,169
but it also takes time,
effort, and patience.

726
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,929
Dating is like

727
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,570
getting bled dry.

728
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,330
Love is a luxury.

729
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:09,499
Dating without money
is as unrealistic as buying Hermes

730
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,650
when you only make 3,000 a month.

731
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,720
Isn't that just like Scandalous Couple?

732
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,170
Say,

733
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,849
I set up the drive.

734
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:19,480
Let's continue watching tonight.

735
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:20,889
Not tonight.

736
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:22,480
I'm flying to Hong Kong for work.

737
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,050
Why are you so obsessed
with making money?

738
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,960
Is your family poor?

739
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,810
Yes.

740
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,960
My parents died when I was little.

741
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,440
I was left alone and helpless.

742
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,850

743
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,680

00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,819
is the fan working or not?

746
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,699
I can't feel the wind.

747
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,520
I don't get it.

748
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:56,330
If all the wind levels are the same,
why is it set into different levels?

749
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,539
Oh no.

750
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,440
I can't sleep like this.

751
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:03,849
How about

752
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,050
moving your legs close to the wall?

753
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:09,329
I already stuck every part of my legs
against the wall.

754
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:11,929
But the wall is hot too.

755
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,650
It's useless.

756
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,929
Gosh.

757
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,739
I have to sell liquor tomorrow.

758
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,280
The place is so far away.

759
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:23,129
I need to take the bus, subway,

760
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,000
and a rickshaw.

761
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,409
And I need to set off before six.

762
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:30,410
I can't fall asleep right now. Oh no!

763
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:34,369
If only we had air conditioning.

764
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,760
Let's buy one.

765
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,609
No way.

766
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,779
- Why not?
- It's expensive.

767
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,000
Don't buy it.

768
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,920
How about a second-hand one?
We can afford that, right?

769
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,810
It's also expensive.

770
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:47,059
Plus, the electricity bill.

771
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,649
We need to save money.

772
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,219
We haven't had enough money

773
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,240
for next month's rent.

774
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:56,650
And I don't want to throw this fan away.

775
00:33:58,570 --> 00:33:59,720
(Daji,)

776
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,200
(are you broke?)

777
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,200
We still have a little left.

778
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,280
What's more important, movies or money?

779
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,659
(But I can't buy you fried chicken)

780
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,489
(when you're with me.)

781
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:14,699
(That's not okay.)

782
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,130
(I can provide for you.)

783
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,050
Sorry, Daji.

784
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,840
We had it tough.

785
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:25,170
You're suffering.

786
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:28,970
Stop talking.

787
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:32,930
I need to fall asleep in five minutes.

788
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,200
One last thing.

789
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:46,760
I heard people in the photographic
equipment city are buying footage.

790
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,930
I'll try selling some.

791
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:50,760
What?

792
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:51,970
Wait.

793
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,849
We agreed to keep those.

794
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:57,240
Someone between us has to make money.

795
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,739
I'm saying

796
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,489
I need to earn money.

797
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:01,619
I can't leave that to you.

798
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,960
What do you mean by
"someone between us has to make money"?

799
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,099
Am I not making money?

800
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,329
I told you

801
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,650
to leave the money matter to me.

802
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,969
Selling liquor is a lucrative job.

803
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:13,090
We'll be fine once I get my commission.

804
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,050
You don't have to worry about anything.

805
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,369
Just focus on your movie.

806
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:17,299
If you don't,

807
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,849
that means you look down on me.

808
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,130
Got it?

809
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,489
Enough. Stop talking to me.

810
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,200
I need to fall asleep

811
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,570
in five minutes.

812
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,659
Sorry.

813
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,489
I told you to stop.

814
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:50,099
Sorry.

815
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,489
I thought you were asleep.

816
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:53,720
How could I fall asleep that fast?

817
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,329
I heard you snoring.

818
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:57,680
Impossible. I don't snore.

819
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:04,219
There are times when people hit rock bottom
and rise again to their prime.

820
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,450
Don't look down on youth
who is in hard times.

821
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:09,610
Smart youth makes the nation smart.

822
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,299
Strong youth makes the nation strong.

823
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,259
Lend them a light and they'll return
a bright future to the world.

824
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,139
Mister,

825
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,880
please buy my footage.

826
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,970
No.

827
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:20,969
I told you

828
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,930
I really need money.

829
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:25,889
Dude,

830
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,049
do me this favor,

831
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,179
and I'll put your name

832
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,369
in all my movies in the future.

833
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,299
Your name will leave a remarkable trace

834
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,409
in Chinese film history.

835
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:36,050
Your footage is too artsy.
No one will watch it.

836
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,200
Mister, I'll do anything.

837
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:43,240
What I mean

838
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,139
is I can work for you.

839
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,090
I'll do anything about film shooting.

840
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,219
Oh, perfect.

841
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,049
My friend needs someone
to shoot a documentary.

842
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,360
Try that.

843
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,489
You don't have to be so courteous.

844
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,579
As a man,

845
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,889
you need strong shoulders.

846
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,050
I understood.

847
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,299
Can you help me up first?

848
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:05,849
Okay. Come.

849
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,010
Thank you.

850
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:09,929
Come.

851
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:12,259
- All right. I need time to get used to it.
- Okay.

852
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,320
Thank you, boss.

853
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:17,170
What doesn't break you
will make you stronger.

854
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,650
Are you a robot?

855
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,049
Yes.

856
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,720
Can you transform?

857
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,659
I can't.

858
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,819
I need the moon to transform.

859
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,969
Liar.

860
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,929
Transformers can transform.

861
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,889
Only werewolves need the moon.

862
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,699
Obviously, you don't watch movies.

863
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,779
I'm not talking to you.
You're so insensible.

864
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,739
He's disabled.

865
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,929
We should help him.

866
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:50,090
Sorry about that.

867
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,579
Is your spine injured?

868
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,259
You're lying. He's a robot.

869
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:55,779
Look.

870
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,139
This is a posture corrector.

871
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,530
He can't stand without it.

872
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,800
Am I right?

873
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,099
Young man,

874
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,779
sit here.

875
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,450
Quick.

876
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,179
Ma'am,

877
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:04,779
no.

878
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,969
I'm not sitting.

879
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:06,409
Please sit.

880
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,329
Please sit.

881
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:08,090
You...

882
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,200
I'm a young man.

883
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,490
You're a young disabled man.

884
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:15,720
Sit.

885
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,699
Keep an eye on your boy.

886
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,299
Boss, I've done my job.

887
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,849
You should at least pay me for one day.

888
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:21,819
You filmed rubbish.

889
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,739
The crew said

890
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,099
none of your footage is useful.

891
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:24,739
Get lost now.

892
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,889
- Go.
- Wait. What do you mean?

893
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:28,280
- Why isn't my footage useful?
- Did you really do your job?

894
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,099
I did exactly
what the crew wanted me to do.

895
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,659
Did you pay me?

896
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,760
Brat,

897
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,449
why are you here?

898
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,880
Why are you here?

899
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,819
I'm asking for my pay.

900
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,779
Did you get it?

901
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,009
His work sucks.

902
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:43,049
You just don't want to pay me.

903
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:43,800
Bugger off.

904
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,179
You guys move them to the truck.

905
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,530
Wait for me.

906
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,699
Is this all your equipment?

907
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,739
It's for my job.

908
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,880
Your job?

909
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,329
You make movies too?

910
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,179
I'm not that amazing.

911
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,449
I shoot wedding mini-movies.

912
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:02,090
I came up with this concept.

913
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:04,680
Isn't that just wedding videos?

914
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,130
It's fully customized.

915
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,449
Starting at 30,000 yuan.

916
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,889
30,000 for one wedding?

917
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,400
Want to join me?

918
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,329
You want me to do wedding videos?

919
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:14,779
It's mini-movies!

920
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,619
What mini-movies?

921
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,409
Don't try to fool me
with the word "movie".

922
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:18,259
I know what that is.

923
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,009
It's not a movie.

924
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,170
Not even close, okay?

925
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:23,650
Fine.

926
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,739
Brat, swallow your pride
and join me for a couple of gigs.

927
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,130
The money's easy. Not interested?

928
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,819
I need to focus on my own movies.

929
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,099
Just two gigs.

930
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,009
- We can continue with...
- Stay out of my business.

931
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:45,130
I'll figure out my own way.

932
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,970
An angry idiot.

933
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,580
Call me when you change your mind.

934
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,360
You can make lots of money.

935
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,139
Pay me 100 yuan, okay?

936
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,050
Get lost.

937
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,099
Hello, boss?

938
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,259
You again?

939
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,619
Why are you calling again?

940
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,889
Can I try out for the crew
again tomorrow?

941
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:29,929
Can you give me a refund?

942
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,049
This liquor is fake.

943
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,699
No, mister. We...

944
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,819
You can't get a refund
after drinking it.

945
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,739
I drank a bottle

946
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,720
and slept till morning.

947
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,619
That's because you drank
the whole bottle in one go.

948
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,819
You're supposed to sip it.

949
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,409
Yes.

950
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,259
How about you buy another box
and try again?

951
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,409
See how well it works.

952
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,619
I can call the police

953
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,889
and have you arrested for soliciting.

954
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,369
We're not escorts.

955
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:52,200
We're selling liquor.

956
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,819
Look what you're wearing.

957
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,530
It's too revealing.

958
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,480
You even lied about
staying up till 3 AM.

959
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,659
I know you're selling fake booze
by the day,

960
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,009
- and sell yourself by night.
- Watch your mouth.

961
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,779
How could you talk like that?

962
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,299
You're insulting us.

963
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,969
We're not escorts.

964
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:07,049
Calm down, mister.

965
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,400
How could you bully women?

966
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:11,489
- What's going on here?
- How could you talk like that?

967
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:14,329
- If this isn't an insult, then what is?
- Jingshu, what's going on here?

968
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:16,360
- You bully women.
- What do you think you're doing?

969
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,654
Listen, don't hurt him.

970
00:41:17,655 --> 00:41:18,179
Don't fight.

971
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,320
Let's talk it out.

972
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:20,489
Back off.

973
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:21,880
So what I pushed you?

974
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,619
- Calm down.
- Don't point fingers.

975
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,219
- Don't fight.
- Hit him if you dare.

976
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,600
- Don't fight, did you hear me?
- Jingshu, put your coat on.

977
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,680
- Don't touch him.
- Let's speak nicely.

978
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,050
- Don't fight.
- Jingshu, don't rush in.

979
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,219
Don't rush in.

980
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:33,929
Don't fight.

981
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,489
This is dangerous. Quit the job.

982
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:37,409
- But it pays well.
- I'll earn money.

983
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:39,840
- This is really lucrative.
- We made 800 in a day.

984
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,369
I can support you in making movies.

985
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,139
Don't do this kind of job anymore.

986
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,299
Focus on school.

987
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,010
I'll pay for your rent.

988
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,659
What? Who?

989
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,840
I said I'd pay Jingshu's rent.

990
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:12,450
Hello?

991
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,200
Who's speaking?

992
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,170
For real?

993
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:20,880
Thank you.

994
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:22,680
Zhou Shui,

995
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,849
I got a job.

996
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,299
Speak nicely.

997
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,320
Let's talk this through.

998
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,840
I got a job!

999
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,880
A real job.

1000
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,450
(Life is full of wonders.)

1001
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:46,090
(It gives you the "Beautiful" job offer)

1002
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,680
(when you're at your lowest.)

1003
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,680
What does that have to do with us?

1004
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,010
What?

1005
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:59,240
(But it also takes something away)

1006
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:01,760
