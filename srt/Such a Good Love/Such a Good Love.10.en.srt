3
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,100
(Summer 2024, Beijing)

4
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,620
M.I.G contacted me.

5
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,840
He's willing to reconcile.

6
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,020
As for compensation,

7
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,660
I'm confident to get you six figures.

8
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,540
What do you think?

9
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,180
I won't delete the post.

10
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,070
You sure? That's six figures!

11
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,950
Whether it's six figures or even more,

12
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,020
I won't delete the post.

13
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,860
What's wrong with you? Don't you get it?

14
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,100
He didn't manage
to take advantage of you.

15
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,420
You didn't lose anything.

16
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,140
You'll even get so much money.

17
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,350
This is the best result.

18
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,310
I said

19
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,470
I won't delete the post.

20
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,750
Your account belongs to the company.

21
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,380
You have no say on it.

22
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,750
Sure, I quit.

23
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,030
What did you say?

24
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,350
I said I quit.

25
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,100
I'm done!

26
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,950
The choice is mine, right?

27
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,100
You...

28
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,230
How can they terminate
the contract with you?

29
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,820
You're the victim.

30
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,380
I beat him so hard
that he had to get five stitches.

31
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,510
He's the victim.

32
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,580
Besides,

33
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,860
It's me.
I asked for a contract termination.

34
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:48,980
Why?

35
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,420
I was sick of being a model.

36
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,260
I'm fed up with those annoying people.

37
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,950
Forget it.

38
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,700
That day, you came across
half of Beijing to save me.

39
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,820
Do you like me?

40
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,100
Don't misunderstand.

41
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,820
As a model youth of the new era,

42
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,310
I have to stand up for what's right.

43
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,750
Besides,

44
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,190
I would do the same

45
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,310
even if I don't know you.

46
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,790
I don't like you.

47
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,540
Is that so? Brat.

48
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,980
Why did you return to Beijing?

49
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,420
Didn't you come here just to see me?

50
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,980
I really didn't.

51
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,030
I came back to Beijing mainly because

52
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,350
we haven't finished
watching Scandalous Couple.

53
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,190
We have to finish it together,

54
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,980
whatever it takes.

55
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,630
What year did we stop at?

56
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,660
End of 2009.

57
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,790
AI calculated

58
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,860
and said
they would break up before 2010.

59
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,470
Could AI have made a mistake?

60
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,350
No way, AI can't be wrong.

61
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,630
Dare you make a bet with me?

62
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,950
Sure.

63
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,420
What are we betting on?

64
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,750
If they didn't end up breaking up,

65
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,470
you stay in Beijing and don't go back.

66
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,660
What if they broke up?

67
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,230
If they broke up,

68
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,780
I'll stay with you on your last day

69
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,420
in Beijing

70
00:04:15,247 --> 00:04:17,860
(Winter 2009, Beijing)

71
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,110
Mr. Huang.

72
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,190
Daji.

73
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:21,900
Mr. Huang.

74
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,700
Hands full?

75
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,460
No, what do you want me to do?

76
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,340
A fresh graduate for the company.

77
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,220
Take her around.

78
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,260
Is that okay?

79
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,950
No problem, leave it to me.

80
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,380
Learn from Daji.

81
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,260
Got any questions,

82
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:35,950
just ask her.

83
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,430
Sure.

84
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,260
Hello, Daji.

85
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:39,780
Hello.

86
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,340
If you need anything, just let me know.

87
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:41,670
Okay.

88
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,430
Mr. Huang.

89
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,990
Help me make copies of this then.

90
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,630
Okay.

91
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,750
What's your name?

92
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,870
You can call me Jieyu.

93
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,670
Jieyu? Okay.

94
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,310
Is this a printer?

95
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,310
Yes.

96
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,700
Jieyu, the two shots
you connected are wrong.

97
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,460
Look.

98
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,260
When they
talk about the product's efficacy,

99
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,460
you should just give a close-up

100
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,110
before zooming back to the full view.

101
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,260
Yes, that's it. I'll help you fix it.

102
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,110
Look. Does it look

103
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,430
much smoother overall?

104
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,260
Cool.

105
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,990
I get it now.

106
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,110
Sure.

107
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,190
The most important thing

108
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,190
is that if the duration

109
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,490
of the product isn't long enough,

110
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,070
the client won't pay.

111
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,780
This is crucial.

112
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,750
Keep it in mind.

113
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,580
I'll remember it.

114
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,990
Thank you, Daji.

115
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,460
You don't know what I was like
when I just came here.

116
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,310
Back then,

117
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,430
I was always holding
huge stack of textbooks,

118
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,310
studying diligently.

119
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,630
I edited videos everyday.

120
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,780
Even so,

121
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,900
it took me a year
to become a full-time employee.

122
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,950
If you keep slacking off,

123
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,310
you'll have no chance

124
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,580
to become a full-time employee.

125
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,110
But I'm already a full-time employee.

126
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,190
I just completed
the procedures this morning.

127
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:05,870
Today,

128
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,380
I just want a definite answer.

129
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,820
When will my procedures be completed?

130
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,750
Didn't anyone tell you?

131
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,380
Wait for the next batch. Next year.

132
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,110
No, the next batch?

133
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,340
The kid who just came

134
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,630
has already completed hers.

135
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,430
When I submitted the documents,
you told me

136
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,510
it can be done in two weeks.

137
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,110
Now you tell me to wait until next year?

138
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,430
Next year?

139
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,110
The spot for this batch was reserved.

140
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,310
It's the new girl, Jieyu.

141
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,750
Who?

142
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:30,900
Her?

143
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,990
You think I'm a pushover?

144
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,550
I'm that easy to mess with?

145
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,190
Why?

146
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,630
Why did she get it before me?

147
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,460
Why?

148
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,460
Her family member
is a leader in the TV station.

149
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,110
You've been working here for so long.

150
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,900
Don't you get that?

151
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,580
Okay, Mr. Geng.

152
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,360
How are you doing recently?

153
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,550
Are you doing well?

154
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,580
Where's the money?

155
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,260
Why did I forget
to bring my wallet out again?

156
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,140
Can you lend me 500 yuan first?

157
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,310
Are you kidding me?

158
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,550
You scammed 50,000 yuan from me.

159
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,950
And now you want another 500 yuan?

160
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:21,580
Where's my money?

161
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,310
Can you return my money to me first?

162
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,220
I've recently met a wealthy investor.

163
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,190
He already promised me.

164
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,460
Once he brings in the funds,

165
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,690
we'll be free.

166
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,630
The money will be back.

167
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,670
Get lost!

168
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,270
Are you in a pyramid scheme? Reverb.

169
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,500
How dare you fool me again?

170
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,580
How can I believe you?

171
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,070
You haven't looked at the market.

172
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,340
We've passed the bull market

173
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,230
and have a rebound.

174
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,310
Stop talking nonsense!

175
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:44,620
Have you lied so much

176
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,910
that you deceived yourself?

177
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,950
Why are you so fierce?

178
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,980
Did I force you to do it?

179
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,620
Did I scam you?

180
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,150
You gave me the money yourself.

181
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,700
If you had given me an extra 10,000,

182
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,980
we wouldn't have been like this.

183
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,590
You have no right
to ask me for money!

184
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,820
You lost your mind.

185
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,740
Look at yourself.

186
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,030
You don't even have 500.

187
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,460
How do you want to get out of this?

188
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,100
Who lost their mind?

189
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,190
I don't know what to do.

190
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,390
Gosh, I don't want to live anymore.

191
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,950
I don't want to live anymore.

192
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,740
What dumb luck is this?

193
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,030
The train is about to arrive
at Xitucheng station.

194
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,790
Do you really not have 500 yuan?

195
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,190
No.

196
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,270
It will definitely rebound.

197
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,270
This is all I have.

198
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,550
Thank you.

199
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,580
Do you remember

200
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,150
that we had a customer surnamed Geng?

201
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,700
Here's his address and phone number.

202
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,700
He hasn't paid the balance.

203
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,270
Go and ask him for it.

204
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,740
The money is yours if he pays you.

205
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,860
You're the one who owes me money.

206
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,550
Why should I ask him for money?

207
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,340
I really don't have a single cent left.

208
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,580
Take it.

209
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,950
Did you not pay the internet fee?

210
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,150
No internet again.

211
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,500
I forgot.

212
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,150
Are you out of money?

213
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,820
Forget it.

214
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,670
I'll go and pay it.

215
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,190
Where are you going?

216
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,190
I'll go to Glasses' room
to send an email.

217
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,670
We hardly talked in those few months.

218
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,740
We're all afraid of talking too much

219
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,340
that we'll think of that night again

220
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,100
and talk about the unfinished Erguotou.

221
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,580
I never asked him

222
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,910
why he turned off his phone that night.

223
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,340
He also never asked me

224
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,070
what happened that night.

225
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,150
None of us mentioned it.

226
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,820
It's as if

227
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,390
we can pretend that it never happened.

228
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,820
Jieyu, busy?

229
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,340
Mr. Huang.

230
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,220
I'm learning editing from Daji.

231
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,310
Really? How did it go?

232
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,070
Can you adapt
to this working environment?

233
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,820
It's alright.

234
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,580
It's just that I'm a bit slow
getting used to this editing software.

235
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,580
I'm afraid
it will delay our work progress.

236
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,580
There's no hurry.

237
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,030
Take your time.

238
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,310
I heard from your dad

239
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,270
that he planned to send you abroad.

240
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,390
He couldn't bear to let me go.

241
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,430
That's why people say
girls are close to their fathers.

242
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,740
How is he doing recently?

243
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,550
Is he busy?

244
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,580
He's alright.

245
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:17,700
By the way,

246
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,910
my dad also asked me

247
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,220
to invite you over

248
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,580
for dinner this weekend.

249
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,980
He just brought back
some good wine from abroad.

250
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,550
He said he wanted to thank you.

251
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,910
(When I submitted the documents,
you told me)

252
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,030
(it'd be done in two weeks.)

253
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,670
(Now you tell to wait until next year?)

254
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,980
(Next year?)

255
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,700
(Her family member
is a leader in the TV station.)

256
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,230
(You've been working here for so long.)

257
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,790
(Don't you get that?)

258
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,700
Why are you acting so jumpy?

259
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,390
What's wrong?

260
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,220
Yes.

261
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,980
I'm formally informing you

262
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,190
that I'm resigning.

263
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,390
I'm quitting!

264
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,150
You can resign then. Why...

265
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,860
Shut up!

266
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:13,860
Wait.

267
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,740
Listen.

268
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:15,980
Let me show you.

269
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,150
This is my girlfriend!

270
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:18,910
Let me see.

271
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:19,910
She's so beautiful.

272
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,390
Really?

273
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,150
Let me see.

274
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,670
- A stewardess.
- A stewardess?

275
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,670
Really?

276
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,030
Look at my girlfriend

277
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,220
Did you see this?

278
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,340
- Such a beauty.
- No way.

279
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,380
She can't be with you.

280
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,980
We're all trying to make it in Beijing.

281
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,430
Yes.

282
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,820
We're very compatible and reliable.

283
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,270
Wait.

284
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,310
How did the two of them
fall for you two?

285
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,700
What do you mean by that?

286
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,570
What's wrong with us?

287
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,550
- Right.
- What's wrong?

288
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,100
We're

289
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,220
tech talents contributing

290
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,500
to Chinese gaming.

291
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,820
- Tech talents.
- Listen.

292
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,430
This is love.

293
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,150
Don't stop believing in love.

294
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,700
Yes, let me tell you.

295
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,700
My darling said

296
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,910
she likes people
who are honest and simple like me.

297
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,580
Anyway, we're going to detach ourselves

298
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,580
from people with low-level interests
like you.

299
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,310
We're going to find love!

300
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,700
- Sit down.
- Here.

301
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,100
Cheers to your love.

302
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,390
Cheers to your love.

303
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,220
I'm telling you.

304
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:06,980
I'm impressed.

305
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,910
All of this

306
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,030
is destined.

307
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,910
(Whether it's true or not,)

308
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,390
(even they found love.)

309
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,070
(But we lost our love.)

310
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,740
(Recently, newly debuted singer, Long,
released his latest single.)

311
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,270
(The song quickly gained popularity
among the young.)

312
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,820
(It was full of hope and dreams)

313
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,070
(and conveyed a vision for the future.)

314
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,620
(Long is from Chengdu, Sichuan.)

315
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,860
(He was discovered by a scout)

316
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,910
(during his internship
on a domestic variety show)

317
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,030
(and became a singer.)

318
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,390
I met a Feng Shui master online
two days ago.

319
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,950
Next year
is a particularly critical year.

320
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,550
Many people's fate
will usher in a big change.

321
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:47,640
Yes.

322
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,190
I doubt that.

323
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:48,620
Really?

324
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,150
He said that.

325
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,780
Here, think about it.

326
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,220
What changes do you want next year?

327
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:52,910
Okay? Tell us.

328
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,550
Yes.

329
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,860
Old Chives, set an example.

330
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,310
My grandson will start school next year.

331
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,030
I don't want anything else.

332
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,100
I just hope he can get into
a good elementary school in Beijing.

333
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:06,460
This will be the biggest change
for our family.

334
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,390
Good!

335
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,910
Dumbbell, it's your turn!

336
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,030
Okay, let me tell you.

337
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,670
I want to make more money next year

338
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,430
and take a training course

339
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,270
to get my fitness trainer certificate.

340
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,550
I can then be a personal trainer.

341
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,950
I can make a lot more money.

342
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,460
Congratulations.

343
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,949
What do you want to do with money?

344
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:29,620
Don't bother.

345
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,740
Why bother?

346
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:31,820
What about you?

347
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,150
What do you want to do next year?

348
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,740
I don't want to change anything.

349
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,700
I just want to graduate
safely and smoothly.

350
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,070
I have no other ideas.

351
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,150
You're steady.

352
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,910
You have nothing else in mind? Dumbbell.

353
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,030
- Nonsense.
- Really?

354
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,030
Daji.

355
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,740
- You?
- Daji.

356
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,820
Daji, tell us.

357
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,950
Shui, tell us.

358
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,550
Zhou Shui.

359
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,030
Your movie will be released next year.

360
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,190
You'll be a great director.

361
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,980
Yes, you're going to be popular.

362
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,150
Tell us.

363
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,550
I don't want to change anything.

364
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,700
I just want...

365
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,790
to go back to the past.

366
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,220
The past? What do you mean?

367
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,390
What was it like before?

368
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,150
What do you mean by that?

369
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,350
Do you think we'll get back
to what we had?

370
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,260
We can go back.

371
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,500
Of course we can.

372
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,390
We...

373
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:25,950
I will try my best.

374
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,110
You don't have to.

375
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,060
It's useless.

376
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,870
My change has already happened today.

377
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,350
I told the team that I want to quit.

378
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,350
You quit?

379
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,460
Yes, I'm the same as you now.

380
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,500
We're all jobless.

381
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,500
It's okay.

382
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,700
We'll find another one.

383
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,910
We can just find another one.

384
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,830
Yes, find a job.

385
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,670
What matters is that we can
afford the rent

386
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,780
- to stay here.
- Yes.

387
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,110
Do you think
it's alright to just afford the rent?

388
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,110
What about us?

389
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,150
Are we going to waste time like this?

390
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,740
You think it interesting?

391
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,670
Then where do you want to go?

392
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,700
What do you mean?

393
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,950
What do you think I mean?

394
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,110
You don't want to stay in Beijing?

395
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,350
Why do I have to stay in Beijing?

396
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:39,670
Daji.

397
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:40,630
- Daji.
- Daji.

398
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,390
Girl.

399
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,430
Don't make things tense.

400
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,910
Jingshu, go and check on her.

401
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,980
What's wrong with you two?

402
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,060
It's okay. Here.

403
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,150
Yes, here.

404
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:01,980
Shui, slow down.

405
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,670
Zhou Shui.

406
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,020
Zhou Shui.

407
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,390
What are you doing?

408
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,260
Have you ran ten kilometers today?

409
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,740
I ran in the morning. What?

410
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,830
Run with me for a while.

411
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,870
Daji is waiting for you.

412
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,390
Let's go back.

413
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,060
Who is it?

414
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,390
Daji, it's me.

415
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,190
Jingshu, come in.

416
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,830
Are you really leaving?

417
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,910
I've been here for two years.

418
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,390
I've ran out of money

419
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,020
and lost my job.

420
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,590
Everything is back to square one.

421
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,590
Beijing is telling me

422
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,950
that it doesn't welcome me at all.

423
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,300
Why should I stay here?

424
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,390
But if you leave,

425
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,110
what about you and Zhou Shui?

426
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,340
What about your relationship?

427
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:05,830
He...

428
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,390
The same as Beijing.

429
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,500
They have nothing to do with me anymore.

430
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,060
Zhou Shui.

431
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,500
Stop running. Let's go back.

432
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:40,870
I don't want to go back.

433
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,110
Why?

434
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,780
I'm scared.

435
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,780
You two have been together for so long.

436
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,950
Think about it again.

437
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,870
Is this what you want?

438
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,780
I thought I would be unwilling too,

439
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,780
but I feel okay.

440
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,460
It doesn't seem
as difficult as I imagined.

441
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:12,060
I think I'm ready.

442
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,150
I'm afraid

443
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,460
that she'll really talk to me

444
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,390
about leaving Beijing

445
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,110
and really breaking up with me.

446
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,830
Keep her here then.

447
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,060
How can I keep her here?

448
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,020
I don't have money.

449
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,020
I don't have a job.

450
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,430
I don't have anything.

451
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,780
Why should I keep her here?

452
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,980
I've never been in a relationship.

453
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,020
I don't really understand either.

454
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,910
Do you think

455
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,870
dating is just like running?

456
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,150
What do you mean?

457
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,430
For example,

458
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,390
At first you thought
you could run ten kilometers,

459
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,670
but you got tired

460
00:21:58,810 --> 00:21:59,980
before you even ran halfway.

461
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,060
You were out of breath
and wanted to stop,

462
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,460
but it's at this moment

463
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,540
that you kept going

464
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,300
and broke through this limit.

465
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,260
You'll realize

466
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,780
maybe you can really...

467
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,460
You can really run ten kilometers

468
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,630
and even run a marathon.

469
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,460
Run for a lifetime.

470
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,670
So I just have to work hard

471
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,390
and I can keep her?

472
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,190
Yes.

473
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:27,500
Maybe now is the time

474
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,780
when you're breathless.

475
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,390
Don't give up. Hold on.

476
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,980
You'll realize

477
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,830
you might be able

478
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,190
to be together forever.

479
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:45,980
Okay.

480
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,500
I'll work hard.

481
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,260
I want to keep her here!

482
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,910
Ready for what?

483
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,390
I'm ready to break up with him

484
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,590
and say goodbye to Beijing.

485
00:23:05,826 --> 00:23:07,378
(Wontons, Dumplings, Noodles)
Have a try.

486
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,980
Fresh herbal eggs.

487
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,700
Jingshu.

488
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,260
Don't leave.

489
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:16,840
Listen.

490
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,630
Until I'm back, OK?

491
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,390
I'm in a hurry.

492
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,220
No, can you quit this job?

493
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,830
Don't worry about the tuition.

494
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,950
Look, I've saved up so much money.

495
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,500
I can help you with that.

496
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,430
This is your money.

497
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,740
Take it back. I can't take it.

498
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:28,870
We're close.

499
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:29,590
You can take it.

500
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,670
It's due to our relationship

501
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,500
that I can't take it.

502
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,350
What is our relationship?

503
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:36,830
Jingshu.

504
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,630
Let me support you!

505
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,110
Shen, if you marry me,

506
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,540
you'll become a Beijinger.

507
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:48,630
Right?

508
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,260
I will sponsor your college education.

509
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,350
After you graduate from college,

510
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,060
give me a healthy son.

511
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,260
Our family is rich.

512
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,020
You don't need to work outside.

513
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,780
You just take care of our kid at home.

514
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,020
It's better
than staying in the countryside, right?

515
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,540
You make a lot of sense.

516
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,260
I just wonder

517
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,150
if we can meet more often

518
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,220
and get to know each other better.

519
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,060
Yes, you're right.

520
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,740
We should get to know each other better.

521
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,540
Look.

522
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,830
How about you not go back tonight?

523
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,780
Get the marriage certificate
tomorrow morning.

524
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,060
- Let's go.
- Listen, sir.

525
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,020
- Let's go.
- I...

526
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,830
I'm not going. I want to go home!

527
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,870
What do you mean by that?

528
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,390
I'm dating you.

529
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,020
What's wrong?

530
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,110
I'm not dating you.

531
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,020
Please.

532
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,460
No, absolutely not.

533
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,980
Sir, let me go.

534
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,830
Let go! I'm talking to you.

535
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:44,780
Don't move!

536
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,220
Sir.

537
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,830
- You heard me?
- I've spent the money.

538
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,700
- No.
- Let go!

539
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:48,740
Let go!

540
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,190
What are you doing? Who are you?

541
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,390
I'm her boyfriend.

542
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,390
Boyfriend?

543
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,630
Give me.

544
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,390
You just leaving now?

545
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,540
How could you work as a romance decoy?

546
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,980
It's illegal, don't you know?

547
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,020
You have to go to school.

548
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,030
If your school finds out,

549
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:02,740
what will you do?

550
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,260
Dumbbell, my hand...

551
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:08,910
I'm sorry.

552
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,300
I was too anxious just now.

553
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,540
It's okay.

554
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:13,830
Thank you, Dumbbell.

555
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,950
Can you promise me to stop?

556
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,700
It's too dangerous.

557
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,350
I have no choice.

558
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,350
If I can't raise enough money,

559
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,460
I will be expelled.

560
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,190
I can only go back to my hometown.

561
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,500
I know you don't want to leave.

562
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,700
I won't let you leave.

563
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,020
I have nothing.

564
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,500
How can I stay in Beijing?

565
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,150
You have me.

566
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,260
Jingshu.

567
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,700
I...

568
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,830
What do you want to say?

569
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:00,240
What I said earlier
about being your boyfriend,

570
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,110
I just made that up.

571
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,830
I just wanted to scare that old man.

572
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,910
I know.

573
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,220
Let's go home.

574
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,060
Sure.

575
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,830
(Andy Lau, admits to having a wife.)

576
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,010
(He admits to being married.)

577
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,060
Are you still going to work today?

578
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,110
To do the resignation procedures.

579
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,700
I've already paid the electricity bill.

580
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,630
Do you have any dirty laundry?

581
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,700
Put it on the sofa.

582
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,980
I'll wash it later.

583
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,590
Are you coming back for dinner?

584
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,150
I'll be done around 6 PM.

585
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,390
Okay.

586
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,460
I'll wait for you to come back.

587
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,980
We'll eat at Old Chives' stall.

588
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,630
I want to eat out.

589
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,300
I've been in Beijing for so long

590
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,830
but I haven't been to Sanlitun yet.

591
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,910
Let's eat there.

592
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,430
How about 7 PM?

593
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:21,950
Sure.

594
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:31,780
(I know well)

595
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,460
(why Daji asked me to go to Sanlitun.)

596
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,150
(She wants to break up.)

597
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,350
(I want to get back the 20,000 yuan)

598
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:39,870
(to keep her)

599
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,670
(and the last hope)

600
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:42,980
(in our love.)

601
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:59,260
(Beautiful)

602
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,020
Zhou Shui, what a coincidence?

603
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,760
What are the odds
of bumping into you here?

604
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:15,630
What a coincidence.

605
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,260
How you doing?

606
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,350
Pretty good.

607
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,150
Well, I'm going...

608
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,590
I heard that the script competition's

609
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,020
organizing committee contacted you,

610
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,670
but you didn't reply.

611
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,460
How did you know?

612
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,430
Who told you that?

613
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,110
Someone from the organizing committee.

614
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,910
He told me
when we were making preparations.

615
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:32,950
Preparations?

616
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,500
Are you making a movie?

617
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,060
But I'm actually quite embarrassed.

618
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,800
You're the one
who should be making a movie.

619
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,220
What do you mean?

620
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,700
You got first place
in this script competition.

621
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,430
I was after you.

622
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,260
Only the first place is qualified

623
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,060
to make a movie,

624
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,870
but you gave up.

625
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,540
So they gave me the chance.

626
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,500
Sorry, my subway is here.

627
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,150
I'll treat you to a nice meal some day.

628
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,350
- Bye.
- Bye.

629
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,620
I'm off to scout for locations.

630
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,220
Hello.

631
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,110
Hello, are you Mr. Geng?

632
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,590
Are you Mr. Geng?

633
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,390
Mr. Geng.

634
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,390
Hello.

635
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,830
Mr. Geng.

636
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,950
Hello.

637
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:36,700
It's me.

638
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,630
Who are you?

639
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,630
You don't remember me?

640
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,740
I'm Zhou,

641
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,350
who filmed your wedding.

642
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,350
What do you need?

643
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,220
Mr. Geng.

644
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,300
Can you pay me
the balance of 20,000 yuan

645
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,220
you owe me?

646
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,350
Who owes you money?

647
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,260
I don't know you.

648
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,190
I filmed you for the whole afternoon.

649
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,830
I spent two months
editing your video,

650
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,230
yet you're saying you don't know me?

651
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,630
Who told you my home address?

652
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,500
Leave it for now.

653
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,910
Can you pay me first?

654
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,430
I have no money.

655
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,220
You're driving

656
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,060
such a nice car!

657
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,220
Get out first!

658
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,700
Let go.

659
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,540
- No...
- Let go.

660
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,390
Pay me.

661
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,430
My clothes are expensive.

662
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,430
- Pay me.
- Let go!

663
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,220
- OK?
- Let go.

664
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,110
- Are you refusing to pay?
- Let go.

665
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,220
You're playing dirty, huh?

666
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:15,670
So what?

667
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,260
You sure?

668
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:16,830
So what?

669
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,830
Okay. You want to play dirty, right?

670
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,460
Let me tell you.

671
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,870
I'm playing dirty too.

672
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,460
If you don't pay me,

673
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,300
you're not leaving.

674
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,700
You just don't give up, huh?

675
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,390
Pay up.

676
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,220
I have no money.
What can you do about it?

677
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:32,780
Hey, you!

678
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,430
I have no money.

679
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,350
You want to hit me?

680
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,350
What's the matter?

681
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,220
Pay me.

682
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,630
- I don't have any money.
- Pay me!

683
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:38,350
I have no money.

684
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:40,700
I...

685
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,540
I have no money.

686
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,150
Pay me!

687
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:14,670
Miss.

688
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,690
Do you want to order now?

689
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,700
Well, my date isn't here yet.

690
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,770
Can you give me some time?

691
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:19,220
Sure.

692
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:30,350
Over here.

693
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,350
Over here, hurry up.

694
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:31,830
Hurry.

695
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:32,780
Sorry, I'm late.

696
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:34,630
Sorry.

697
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,020
Turns out you went to buy flowers.

698
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,740
Pay me.

699
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:44,590
Pay me!

700
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,460
Pay me, you hear me?

701
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,260
You want more punches?

702
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,540
- Let go.
- Pay me.

703
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,300
Let go.

704
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,630
Take this to see a doctor.

705
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,220
What an unlucky day.

706
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,020
Pay me.

707
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,670
Pay me, you hear me?

708
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,590
Pay me!

709
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,390
Miss.

710
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,980
Our restaurant is getting full.

711
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,430
If you don't order,

712
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,780
we can't keep the table for you.

713
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,590
I'm sorry, I'll leave.

714
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:50,430
Okay.

715
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:54,500
Daji.

716
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,300
I'm late.

717
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,390
- What happened?
- Sorry.

718
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,910
Hello, we're here.

719
00:32:58,910 --> 00:32:59,460
Wait.

720
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:00,700
Let's order.

721
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,910
Give us the menu. Thank you.

722
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,020
What happened to your face?

723
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,460
What happened to you?

724
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,260
I fell.

725
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,220
You fell?

726
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:07,950
Let me order.

727
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,430
Let's see what's good to eat.

728
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:15,140
(Main Course, Steak: 798, 298, 1099)

729
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,020
(Seafood Stew: 179, Seafood Pot: 258)

730
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,460
A quick question. How big is this cake?

731
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,830
It's as big as the flower.

732
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,500
I want one then.

733
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,590
Daji, take a look.
What would you like to eat?

734
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,350
It's okay, I'm not hungry.

735
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,780
Well,
can you get us two glasses of water?

736
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,630
We charge for water here.

737
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,060
Perrier water, 68 yuan per bottle.

738
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:54,980
68 yuan?

739
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,300
Give us two bottles.

740
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,150
Two glasses of water and one cake,
right?

741
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:58,700
Yes.

742
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,110
All right.

743
00:33:59,110 --> 00:33:59,870
Thank you.

744
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,830
Here you are.

745
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:11,870
Please enjoy.

746
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:12,910
Thank you.

747
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:14,910
Daji.

748
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,100
Today is our 520th day

749
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,100
together.

750
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,750
For the next 520 days,

751
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,540
the 520 days after that,

752
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,180
- and every days in my life,
- Proposal?

753
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,540
I want to be with you.

754
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:25,830
Marry me.

755
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:31,580
- Marry him!
- Marry him!

756
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:32,660
- Marry me.
- Marry him.

757
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,790
Kiss each other.

758
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,100
Stop filming.

759
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,850
- I've decided.
- I have something to say.

760
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,140
I...

761
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,310
Can I speak first?

762
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,350
Go ahead.

763
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,140
Daji.

764
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,660
Dumbbell told me before

765
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,660
that a relationship is like a marathon.

766
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,430
The first five kilometers are difficult.

767
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,230
Many people give up.

768
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:07,710
But if

769
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,460
two people

770
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,100
try together,

771
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,870
maybe they can run
to the finish line together.

772
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:34,020
This isn't my original plan.

773
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,620
I had a little accident.

774
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,790
I can only afford this.

775
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,490
When I'm rich,
I'll give you the real one.

776
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,180
It's a bit awkward,

777
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,460
but what I want to say is the same.

778
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,460
Daji.

779
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,180
No matter what happened before,

780
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,100
I just want to ask you one question.

781
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,460
Will you marry me?

782
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,180
Wait.

783
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,310
You said no matter what happened before.

784
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,430
What does it mean?

785
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:25,950
Let's not talk about it,.

786
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,140
Why not?

787
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,100
But I think that's my fault.

788
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,950
Do you think I slept with him?

789
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:35,750
Just leave it, okay?

790
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:36,980
You think I cheated on you?

791
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,910
I didn't think that.

792
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,260
I don't care what happened.

793
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,500
- What do you mean
- Stop it.

794
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,310
- by that?
- Don't

795
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,390
- You think...
- tell me...

796
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,310
No matter what...

797
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,240
I don't want to know

798
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,140
what happened that day.

799
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,010
I don't care.

800
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,540
I just want to ask if you'll marry me.

801
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,750
No!

802
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,870
I'll tell you what happened that night.

803
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,430
That day, I went to

804
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,460
deliver the money.

805
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,830
I went to find you a job.

806
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,540
He was drinking when I entered.

807
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,140
He must have gotten drunk.

808
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:17,830
And he...

809
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,910
He wanted to rape me.

810
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,660
I ran to the bathroom to call you.

811
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,710
I couldn't get through.

812
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,100
I don't know why.

813
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,460
Zhou Shui, did you do it on purpose?

814
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,390
Of course I didn't mean it, Daji.

815
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,540
Then why can't I get through?

816
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,910
I charged my phone,

817
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:42,750
but Vest and Glasses

818
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,430
were mining Bitcoin

819
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,500
in their room that day.

820
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,830
I tried charging,

821
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:47,830
- Zhou Shui.
- but I...

822
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:48,910
I think you can really

823
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,460
make up any nonsense.

824
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,310
I'm not, Daji.

825
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:51,830
Then why did

826
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:52,830
my first call go through?

827
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:53,460
I swear.

828
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,060
- but the second call didn't?
- I swear.

829
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,870
- Why did you turn it off?
- I didn't receive.

830
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,310
- Do you know
- I swear, Daji.

831
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,430
how scared I was?

832
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,660
- Why?
- I swear.

833
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,430
Why are you not around

834
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,390
every time I need you?

835
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,870
Do you know how scared I was?

836
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,870
Zhou Shui, you're really a jerk.

837
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,100
I don't care if you care.

838
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,580
But let me tell you that I care.

839
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,060
When we first came to Beijing,

840
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:34,870
we lived
in a five-square-meter rental room.

841
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:37,060
We shared a bowl of instant noodles

842
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,790
and the only down jacket.

843
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,310
We've gone through so many difficulties.

844
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,310
I promise you

845
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,750
that no matter what is ahead of us,

846
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,270
it won't separate us.

847
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,430
We will always be together.

848
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:49,950
I promise you.

849
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:55,620
- A kiss.
- A kiss.

850
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,460
Waiter, get us the bill. Thank you.

851
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,620
Hello, 216 yuan.

852
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,660
I'll pay.

853
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,580
I'll cover the rest.

854
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,580
I don't care what happened.

855
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,350
Daji.

856
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,910
You don't care? You...

857
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,660
Do you think I slept with him?

858
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,310
No, Daji.

859
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,580
What do you mean you don't care?

860
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,750
I don't want
to know what happened, Daji.

861
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,460
It's not that I...

862
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,910
I'm afraid if I bing it up...

863
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,020
- What?
- If I...

864
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,140
You just think that way.

865
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,430
I don't care what happened.

866
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,790
I just want to ask if you want...

867
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,100
No.

868
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,870
Got anything you want to roast about?

869
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,980
I think they're quite pitiful.

870
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,180
I can't bear to roast them anymore.

871
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:42,790
Let's keep watching.

872
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,790
This is the last one.

873
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,430
No more after this?

874
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,660
No more.

875
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,140
Do you think

876
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,790
they broke up?

877
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,340
If it were you, wouldn't you break up?

878
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,950
They already came to this.

879
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:17,980
You're right.

880
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,660
Big data is really powerful.

881
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,660
I don't think they're that special.

882
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,020
They're just like everyone else.

883
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:31,660
But somehow

884
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,870
I suddenly envy them a little.

885
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,270
What's there to envy?

886
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:38,830
Their love is exciting.

887
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:40,620
But what about me?

888
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,060
My life over the past 20+ years

889
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:47,180
has been as dull as plain water.

890
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,390
Plain water is good.

891
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:52,750
It's good for health.

892
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,790
It's important to lead a healthy life,

893
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,500
but passionate love is exciting.

894
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,230
When are you leaving?

895
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,580
The day after tomorrow.

896
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:07,540
How about this?

897
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,100
Come to my house tomorrow.

898
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:13,140
I'll stay with you
on your last day here.

899
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,020
Have you forgotten?

900
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,100
I'm willing to accept defeat.

901
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:31,140
(Erguotou)

902
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,020
Hello? Hi.

903
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,870
You're Zhou Shui's girlfriend, right?

904
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:00,870
He got into a fight

905
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:01,790
and is detained here.

906
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,100
Wait.

907
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:02,750
Hurry over.

908
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:03,660
Well...

909
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,980
Which police station?

910
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,390
Okay.

911
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,980
I'll be there soon.
