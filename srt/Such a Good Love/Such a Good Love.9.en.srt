00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,220
=Episode 9=

3
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,260
(Summer 2024, Beijing)

4
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,310
Triple kill! Quadra kill!

5
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,310
Penta kill!

6
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,070
Go! Get them!

7
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,260
Charge! Critical Armor!

8
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,660
Amazing!

9
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,230
Good job!

10
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:22,540
Well.

11
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,510
He's really good.

12
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,260
What? Leyi.

13
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,910
He made a few mistakes.

14
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,420
I think he might be

15
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,310
a little too nervous.

16
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,380
Zihao, stop talking nonsense.

17
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,860
Go ahead and play if you're capable.

18
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,630
No, I'm not talking nonsense.

19
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,860
No, I'm not talking nonsense.

20
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,310
They invited me before,

21
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,630
but I refused.

22
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,660
Because I think
their peak period is short.

23
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,540
And I'm still studying.

24
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,860
Stop bragging.

25
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,820
Play one-on-one against others
if you're capable.

26
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,700
Sure.

27
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,260
If you don't believe me, I'll play.

28
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,580
A one-on-one duel.

29
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,790
We'll use Aatrox.

30
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,190
I won't say I'll definitly win.

31
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,660
but there's at least a 50% chance.

32
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,380
Have you drunk too much?

33
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,350
Where are we going next?

34
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,750
I brought a hard drive.

35
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,820
How about we find a quiet place

36
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,950
- Sure.
- to watch?

37
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,230
I'd like to pay the bill.

38
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,380
No, I already settled it.

39
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,100
Really?

40
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,350
You're so generous today.

41
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,260
You won the lottery?

42
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,700
I just passed

43
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,820
the civil service exam.

44
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,100
All that's left is the interview.

45
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,510
I'm close to landing a job.

46
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,310
Are you going back
to your hometown then?

47
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,860
Beijing is so competitive.

48
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,190
Who wants to stay here?

49
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,790
Sure. Congratulations.

50
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,950
Box 13 has been opened.

51
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,350
Have you booked your ticket to go back?

52
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,540
Early next month.

53
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,190
Why wait until next month?

54
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,630
You want me to leave now?

55
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,790
It doesn't bother me.

56
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,580
When you leave
has nothing to do with me.

57
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,750
Why are you being so sarcastic?

58
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,230
Where are we going next?

59
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,980
I booked a ride home.

60
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,510
Well... Let's meet after you finish

61
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,950
shooting tomorrow.

62
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,980
Let's talk about it next time.

63
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,260
Aren't you having the interview?

64
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,470
I dare not hold you up.

65
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,260
You don't want me to go back?

66
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,470
You? Little brat.

67
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,780
Wait.

68
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,340
You came.

69
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,820
What outfit are you in?

70
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,750
Have you never seen cosplay?

71
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,950
What?

72
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,340
Did you bring your equipment?

73
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,990
Yes, it's in my bag.

74
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,310
Why did you call me here so urgently?

75
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,140
You'll find out in a moment.

76
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,990
M.I.G, this is my brother.

77
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:39,510
Hi.

78
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,700
You came.
I'll come over after I finish this set.

79
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,870
Isn't he the pro?

80
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,870
What do you think of him?

81
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,140
What do you mean?

82
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,630
Isn't he quite charming?

83
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,380
Is he your type?

84
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,510
He has over ten million followers
on Weibo.

85
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,950
It doesn't matter what type he is.

86
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,750
What matters the most
is to drive some traffic to my Weibo.

87
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,340
You can do it yourself.

88
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,950
Why did you call me over?

89
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,070
Have you forgotten?

90
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,820
Hello.

91
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,750
Hi.

92
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,460
Hi.

93
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,670
I heard your winning rate is 50/50
if you use Aatrox

94
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,950
to play against me one-on-one.

95
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:22,950
Why don't we try it?

96
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,430
First blood.

97
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,580
Wipe out.

98
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:36,900
What do you think?

99
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,750
Aatrox, you're incapable.

100
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,140
I'm a rookie. I'm sorry.

101
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,670
Good.

102
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:51,990
Very good.

103
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,700
Leyi is your girlfriend, right?

104
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,950
No, we're just partners.

105
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,510
Partners?

106
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,900
You've slept with her, right?

107
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,700
What did you say?

108
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:12,110
I said, you've slept with her, right?

109
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,510
Are you kidding me?

110
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,220
We're friends.

111
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,340
You're indeed a rookie.

112
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,700
That's it for today.

113
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,140
You've all worked hard, okay?

114
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,260
Thank you guys.

115
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,670
Thank you guys.

116
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,990
By the way, what about you?

117
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,990
How about I drive you?

118
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,070
Sure, I happen to have
a collaboration idea.

119
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,630
It'll be good for our following.

120
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,580
Sure, no problem.

121
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,340
I'll go get changed first then.

122
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,430
Sure, I'll wait for you at the door.

123
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,260
Okay.

124
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,190
What?

125
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,340
Bring me along later.

126
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,580
Why? We adults have business
to talk about.

127
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,750
Bring me along.

128
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,700
Book a ride home yourself.

129
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,510
No.

130
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,750

00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,260
Glasses, Vest.

134
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,430
Lend me your computer to send an email.

135
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,550
No.

136
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,870
Shui, we're mining.

137
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:17,990
We can't do anything else.

138
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,900
Shui, just find an internet cafe outside.

139
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,630
Don't get in our way.

140
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,140
You're still mining?

141
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,190
Fine, you guys carry on.

142
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:26,750
Okay.

143
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,900
(The exchange rate of Bitcoin
to US dollars was approximately.)

144
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,550

(The production rate
is set to be fast and then slow.)

150
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,700
Hello? Yiming.

151
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,110
Hello?

152
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,820
Now?

153
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,340
Okay.

154
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,670
Okay, give me a moment.

155
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,750
Yiming.

156
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,260
You found me so urgently.

157
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,780
Is there some issue

158
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,070
with the job search?

159
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,070
My boss responded to me.

160
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,270
He basically agreed.

161
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,190
He agreed?

162
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,580
Really?

163
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,310
Yiming, you're awesome.

164
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,430
How come you're so awesome?

165
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,270
- Enough.
- You're so reliable.

166
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,430
Are you that happy?

167
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,550
Of course, Yiming.

168
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,490
It's the happiest thing

169
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,340
that has happened to me
in the past two years.

170
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,270
I promised you,

171
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,620
so I'll definitely make it.

172
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,030
Yes, are we transferring

173
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,190
the employment records next?

174
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,500
There's no hurry.

175
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,030
We asked someone for a favor,

176
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,500
shouldn't we show our gratitude?

177
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,390
Yes.

178
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,430
You might need to prepare some money.

179
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,390
Not much.

180
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,030
My boss still owes me a favor.

181
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,860
Just 20,000 yuan.

182
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,150
20,000 yuan?

183
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,390
Is that difficult?

184
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,670
20,000 yuan?

185
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,860
It's fine.

186
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,150
My mother just wired me
some money two days ago.

187
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,700
She made some money
from stock trading.

188
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,980
I was just about to return it.

189
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,190
I'll use it first.

190
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,580
How do I give this money to your boss?

191
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,620
Why don't you invite him out for a meal?

192
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,430
I'll give him them.

193
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,550
How could you two meet for such a thing?

194
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,150
How about this?

195
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,270
If you believe me,

196
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,620
just give me the money.

197
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,340
I'll give it to him privately.

198
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,220
What do you think?

199
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,070
Yes, I believe you.

200
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,620
I give it to you tomorrow?

201
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,790
It's Monday tomorrow.

202
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,340
I have to go on a business trip.

203
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,460
I'll be gone for two weeks.

204
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,500
How about this?

205
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,980
Around 9 PM tonight.

206
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,100
I'll be done with work.

207
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,270
Come to my home.

208
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,580
Today?

209
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,100
Sure, let's do it today then.

210
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,670
This is 10,000 yuan.

211
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,790
Take it first.

212
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,150
What do you mean?

213
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,100
Don't get me wrong.

214
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,500
I've heard about what happened to you.

215
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,950
What?

216
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,150
Your financial aid stopped paying.
I can help you.

217
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,700
You mean my tuition?

218
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,790
Thank you.

219
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,150
But it's okay.
I'll figure it out myself.

220
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,430
But I want to help you.

221
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,910
I can't bear to see you leave school

222
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,150
and me.

223
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,430
Whether you're choosing
to further study or working,

224
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,500
it will be a help.

225
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,980
Put the money away first.

226
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,670
I can't take your money anymore.

227
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,070
I'll figure it out myself.

228
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,670
Can't I just lend it to you?

229
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,860
You can pay me back when you have money.

230
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,860
Thank you, Dongting.

231
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,740
But I can make money by working.

232
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,860
Just take care of Jingjing.

233
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,910
I don't want your credit cards.

234
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,980
I don't want your down jackets either.

235
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:01,030
You have to keep these in Beijing
for your own use.

236
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,270
I won't find another girlfriend.

237
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,460
Never.

238
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,670
You're all I want.

239
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,700
Are you watching?

240
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,390
Yes.

241
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,460
Just let it play.

242
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,950
I can just listen to the sound.

243
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,950
We'll take it until the distance

244
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,500
is enough to circle the earth once.

245
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,190
What are you chatting about with him?

246
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,500
I want him to interact with me

247
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,790
on Weibo,

248
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,580
so I can gain more followers.

249
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,500
I have a chance.

250
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,820
(I dreamed of you yesterday.)

251
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,340
That's our ending.

252
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,430
You better be careful.

253
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,270
He's creepy

254
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,500
and not a good guy.

255
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,150
What do you mean?

256
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,310
Do you know

257
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,430
what he told me
the last time he called me out?

258
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,700
What did he say?

259
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,910
He asked me
if I had ever slept with you.

260
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,220
Is that all?

261
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,950
What do you mean by that?

262
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,910
You don't think it disgusting?

263
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,500
He's just bragging.

264
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,500
It's fine.

265
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,950
I've met many people
with Schizoid Personality Disorder

266
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:02,860
and filthy thoughts.

267
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,310
I can handle him.

268
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,910
Look. Don't worry.

269
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,620
Daji.

270
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,030
I'm back.

271
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,100
Why are you only back now?

272
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,950
I have good news.

273
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,070
I might have secured a job.

274
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,190
- You don't have to.
- I've...

275
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,100
You don't have to find.

276
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,500
The TV station has agreed.

277
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,740
Come with me.

278
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,310
Let's go.

279
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:25,790
To where?

280
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,950
We're going to find Yiming.

281
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,150
The head has agreed.

282
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,580
Giving 20,000 to Yiming,

283
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,560
and this will be settled.

284
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,550
20,000 yuan?

285
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,220
Yes.

286
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,500
Do we have 20,000 yuan?

287
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,030
My mom gave it to me two days ago.

288
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:40,580
No.

289
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,070
I can't use your mom's money.

290
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:43,790
Pay her back.

291
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,310
How can you find a job without money?

292
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,900
You can't join the TV station without it.

293
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,580
Then forget it.

294
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,950
I went looking for a job today.

295
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,240
I interviewed with a film company

296
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,190
and an advertising one.

297
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,400
- We had a good chat.
- No.

298
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,550
Zhou Shui, there's no way

299
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,460
you can compare those jobs
with TV stations.

300
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,270
Many people

301
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,390
tried very hard to join TV stations
but failed.

302
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,820
Once you join the TV station,

303
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,040
you'll have social insurances

304
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,230
and a household registration.

305
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,550
You might even get a house.

306
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,820
Housing fund, household registration,
a formal position,

307
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,690
and social insurances.

308
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:08,910
No.

309
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,820
Why are we talking

310
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,190
about these every day now?

311
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,860
Daji.

312
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,070
Wwhy we came to Beijing

313
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,340
in the first place?

314
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,220
Didn't we want to make a name

315
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,070
in the film industry

316
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:18,970
when we came here?

317
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,390
- Aren't we here for movies?
- Yes.

318
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,500
I can't become someone

319
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,620
- like Yang Yiming.
- No.

320
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,100
I can't.

321
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,860
I didn't ask you to be like Yang Yiming.

322
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,270
Zhou Shui, you're being naive.

323
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,860
You're telling me this now.

324
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,590
Do you think I'm harming you

325
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,790
by begging others and drinking

326
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,150
-  with them?
- I...

327
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,340
I don't think so.

328
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,790
I just want you to stop drinking

329
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,100
and begging others,

330
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,310
so I went looking for a job.

331
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:37,980
But those jobs

332
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,620
are no match
for a job at the TV station.

333
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,240
How?

334
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,670
- Dai Daji.
- Why can't you listen?

335
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:41,910
Well.

336
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,820
Why didn't you tell me
before borrowing

337
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,220
20,000 yuan from your mom?

338
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,580
You invested 50,000 yuan

339
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,100
without consulting me either.

340
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:53,910
No.

341
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,460
I'm really going to be late.

342
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:55,860
Zhou Shui.

343
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,980
Are you going with me?

344
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,690
I'm not going.

345
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,550
You shouldn't either.

346
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,550
Pay back to your mom.

347
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,620
Don't give Yang Yiming.

348
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,070
My mom gave me that money.

349
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,150
It's none of your business.

350
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:03,670
Dai Daji.

351
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,980
Buying a formal position

352
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,030
at a TV station for 20,000?

353
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,150
How naive are you?

354
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,190
You're too naive, Daji.

355
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,490
You thought you can get rich

356
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,620
and buy a house with 50,000.

357
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,620
You're the naive one.

358
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,310
Whatever.

359
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,550
Dai Daji.

360
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,270
You're not allowed to go.

361
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,070
You hear me?

362
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,500
If you walk out of this door today,

363
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,430
I'll break up with you.

364
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,030
Whatever.

365
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,150
Let's break up then.

366
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,460
What do you mean? Dai Daji.

367
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,390
Dai Daji!

368
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:04,860
You came.

369
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:05,980
Yiming.

370
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,500
The 20,000 yuan is all here.

371
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,220
Calculate it.

372
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:08,820
Thoughtless.

373
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,100
How could you give me money here?

374
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,910
Come in and chat.

375
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,740
It's inappropriate. It's late.

376
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:13,740
Come in.

377
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,600
I have other work-related matters
to tell you.

378
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,220
Come on.

379
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,310
Sure.

380
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,270
Why are you outside?

381
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,390
Come in and play.

382
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,340
I'll skip it today.

383
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:41,790
Why?

384
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,220
I have to go back tomorrow.

385
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,460
The civil service exam.

386
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,620
I'm here to give you this.

387
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:47,790
What?

388
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,740
Scandalous Couple?

389
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,790
Why did you give it to me?

390
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,910
Aren't I going back for a few days?

391
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,860
I'm afraid I'll lose it
if I keep it in the dormitory,

392
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,430
so I'll leave it with you first.

393
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,980
We can watch it together
when I'm back.

394
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,790
Just upload it to the cloud storage.

395
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:04,030
This way,
we can watch it anytime we want.

396
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,670
We don't even need to meet up.

397
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,740
Without you,

398
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,430
watching alone isn't as fun.

399
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,190
Is that so?

400
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,150
Let's go, Leyi.

401
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,110
- Next stop.
- Okay.

402
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,270
Where are you going?

403
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:20,980
I'm telling you.

404
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,220
He promised me tonight

405
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,320
that he'll take a photo with me
and post it on Weibo.

406
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,220
It would get on the trending list.

407
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,580
Do you know

408
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,340
how many fans a photo can bring me?

409
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,340
Are you coming?

410
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,340
Coming.

411
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,100
Take this.

412
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,340
Let's watch it when you get back.

413
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,820
Be safe.

414
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,190
I even mentioned breaking up

415
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,620
to prevent her from leaving.

416
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,460
It's 20,000 yuan.

417
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,030
If I really use the money
her mom gave me

418
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:02,910
to secure a job,

419
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,740
how can I face her mom in the future?

420
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,700
Besides, that Yang Yiming?

421
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,950
Why should I give him money?

422
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,260
It's hard
to get into the production team.

423
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,020
Isn't Daji doing this for your own good?

424
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,780
Yes, I know she's doing it
for my own good.

425
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:20,980
But you know what? Dumbbell.

426
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,540
I don't want to join
the production team at all.

427
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,950
We came to Beijing to make movies.

428
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,500
We're not here to join a production team

429
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,300
to switch camera angles.

430
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,020
We're not here to do those things.

431
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:38,430
Isn't filming a movie
the same as switching camera angles?

432
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,390
What's the difference?

433
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,950
Yes.

434
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,060
There's no difference.

435
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,670
Jingshu came to Beijing to study,

436
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,390
not work.

437
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,670
Sometimes,
I really want to persuade her,

438
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,740
but I have no courage.

439
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,350
Hey.

440
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,460
What's there to be shy about?

441
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,020
Just tell her.

442
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,430
I'm shy.

443
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:15,700
I'll help you.

444
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,780
Don't tell her.

445
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:17,950
Let me call Jingshu.

446
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:18,950
Don't call her.

447
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,220
Why call her?

448
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:20,950
Don't call her.

449
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:21,780
Don't persuade me.

450
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,350
My darn phone died again.

451
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,110
Jeez.

452
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,110
Let me tell you. I actually...

453
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,260
I get it.

454
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,590
I've been in Beijing for over a year.

455
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,740
I've never given her
a sense of security.

456
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,870
I also know

457
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,220
Jingshu doesn't want to work.

458
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,150
But she has to make money.

459
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,350
For her tuition.

460
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,540
With no money in Beijing,

461
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,460
how can you get a sense of security?

462
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,110
If I give her all my money,

463
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,430
will she feel safe?

464
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,700
I really don't have any money.

465
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,870
What can I do?

466
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,220
What do you think
of these calligraphies?

467
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,500
I received them yesterday.

468
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,980
Many people competed with me for them.

469
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:27,950
I'm telling you.

470
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,390
Everyone in Beijing's art circle

471
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,780
is friends with me.

472
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:31,980
Everything I collect

473
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,980
is definitely good stuff.

474
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,190
This was written
by the same calligrapher who wrote

475
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,670
the one that used to hang on my wall.

476
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,950
Guess how much it is?

477
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,870
Yiming.

478
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:43,220
It's getting late.

479
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,260
How about I go back first?

480
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,430
Why are you in such a hurry?

481
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,870
I'm afraid of disturbing your rest.

482
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,260
- You have work tomorrow.
- No.

483
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,350
Just keep me company.

484
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,020
Okay?

485
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,260
Don't be fooled
by how glorious I look outside.

486
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,980
Socializing with superiors all day long.

487
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,190
I don't even have someone

488
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,460
I can confide in.

489
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,870
Here. Drink some.

490
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,300
Speaking of,

491
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,540
my friend happened to

492
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,350
give me a nice bottle of whiskey.

493
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,260
How about we drink some?

494
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,060
No, Yiming.

495
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,590
- You're drunk.
- I'll get glasses.

496
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,500
It's okay.

497
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,350
Well, I'll get them for you.

498
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,260
Stay seated.

499
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:23,700
Sure.

500
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,260
- Okay.
- OK.

501
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,150
They're on that table.

502
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:25,630
Okay.

503
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,220
Is this okay? Yiming.

504
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,500
I'll wash them for a bit.

505
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,540
Yiming,
you haven't even washed the bowl.

506
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,190
How about I wash them for you?

507
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,540
Don't bother. Just leave it there.

508
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,300
No, it's okay.

509
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,260
It won't take much time.

510
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,300
I'll wash it for you.

511
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,590
Work seems to stress you out a bit.

512
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:03,630
♪How many people admire
your youthful appearance?♪

513
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,950

Well...

517
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,780
Do you remember

518
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,460
that I sang this song

519
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,940
at our high school's new year party?

520
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,300
Today, I dedicate this to poor Ms. Daji
who came to my house

521
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,020
and do the dishes.

522
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,060
Thank you.

523
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:41,700
Well...

524
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:46,830
Well...

525
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,500
I'll put the glasses over there.

526
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:51,300
Sure.

527
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,150
Go!

528
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,220
Pay attention to your mana.

529
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:55,670
Here.

530
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,830
- Okay, bro.
- Here.

531
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,350
Give me a moment.

532
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,500
Here. Look into the camera.

533
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,220
Amazing.

534
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,830
Come on, let's take a photo first.

535
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,670
Wait.

536
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,540
Let me teach you how to play.

537
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,020
Here.

538
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,460
I...

539
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,060
I'll carry you.

540
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,700
No thanks. I don't know how to play.

541
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,460
It's okay. I'll teach you.

542
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,830
- Put it on.
- No.

543
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,780
I really don't know how to play.

544
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,700
It's okay. Here.

545
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,980
Here, this is R. It's for sprinting.

546
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:28,110
This is attack. Q, W, E, R.

547
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,110
Attack button.

548
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,460
(Su Zihao)

549
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,430
Wait, I have a call.

550
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,500
Ignore it.

551
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,390
Let me take it first.

552
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,220
I really have a call.

553
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,590
You play first, okay?

554
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:37,870
Hello?

555
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,540
What's the matter?

556
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,220
Are you not done yet?

557
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,630
I guess it'll last until morning.

558
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:46,980
Where are you now?

559
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,150
Do you need me to pick you up?

560
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:49,980
No thanks.

561
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,780
I'm afraid you're not safe.

562
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,740
Is that really necessary?
There are a lot of people upstairs.

563
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,670
Send me your location then.

564
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:00,190
Brat, why aren't you asleep yet?

565
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,260
I'm staying up today. I'm studying.

566
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,060
Do as I say.

567
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,350
Send me your location.

568
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,350
Stop dawdling.

569
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,780
Focus on your studies.

570
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,260
I'll hang up now.

571
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,830
Where are the others?

572
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,740
They all left and went home.

573
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,980
How about having a drink?

574
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:39,830
No.

575
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,460
I'll go home first then.

576
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,740
Don't you want to take a photo?

577
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:46,540
Fine.

578
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,190
Let's take it here.

579
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,460
Okay, come on.

580
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,700
What are you doing?

581
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,300
What are you doing?

582
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,220
Get a grip on the situation.

583
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,700
I don't plan to sleep with you.

584
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,670
Why are you pretending?

585
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,870
If you don't want, why flirt with me?

586
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,590
I'm flirting with your ten million fans,

587
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,780
not a trash like you.

588
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,500
Trash?

589
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,300
Who do you think you are?

590
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,220
Aren't you just a little model?

591
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,460
Aren't you models
meant to be slept with?

592
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,430
What's wrong with you?

593
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,830
- Go away.
- Don't want a photo?

594
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,540
Come on.

595
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,700
- Go away!
- Sit on my lap.

596
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,900
(Tong Leyi, Location)

597
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,430
Yiming.

598
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,350
It's getting really late.

599
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,540
I really can't stay.

600
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,430
I'm going home.

601
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,670
Don't go.

602
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,540
No.

603
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,430
I really have to.

604
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,110
Zhou Shui
is still waiting for me at home.

605
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,980
I really like you.

606
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:16,700
No.

607
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,190
Yiming, you're drunk.

608
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:18,950
Well... I...

609
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,980
I'm not drunk.

610
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,110
Why don't you move in with me?

611
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,390
I'll take care of you.

612
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,630
What do you mean?

613
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,350
I already have a boyfriend.

614
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,390
How is he a boyfriend?

615
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,150
Does he have money?
Can he take care of you?

616
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:31,310
Hey.

617
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,930
So what if he doesn't have money?

618
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,390
He's my boyfriend.

619
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,460
Besides...

620
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,350
Besides, we

621
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,390
are doing well.

622
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,500
Doing well?

623
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,930
You live in such a shabby place.

624
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,220
Look at my house.

625
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,300
This is what's good.

626
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,150
People are hustling in Beijing.

627
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,020
They all work hard.

628
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,020
You think you can

629
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,220
live well by working hard?

630
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,190
Don't be stupid.

631
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,740
Even if you waste all your youth,

632
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,150
you won't be able to live this life.

633
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,350
- I can give it to you.
- I...

634
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,020
Do you know that?

635
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,220
I'm willing to waste my youth

636
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,350
because I love him.

637
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,830
What's the use of having a big house?

638
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,020
I still despise you.

639
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,460
You despise me?

640
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,780
Yes, I despise you.

641
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,910
What gave you two the right

642
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:09,980
to despise me?

643
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,190
Who do you think you are then?

644
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,060
How different do you think you are?

645
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:18,830
You came to me

646
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,220
to get him a formal position!

647
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,190
Let me tell you.

648
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,540
You really think that 20,000

649
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,630
can get you a position?

650
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,870
I have the formal position,
but he has no chance!

651
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,590
What do you mean?

652
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:32,910
You lied to me?

653
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,350
I didn't promise you anything.

654
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,870
How is it lying?

655
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:39,950
You scumbag.

656
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,700
What are you doing?

657
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:45,700
Let go!

658
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,150
If you sleep here tonight,

659
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,390
I can promise to let you

660
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,300
join the TV station.

661
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,300
What's wrong with you?

662
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,590
You darn pervert!

663
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,540
Let go!

664
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,350
Hurry.

665
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,430
Keep mining. Mine faster.

666
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,110
Smoke.

667
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,390
Smoke!

668
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:15,590
My Bitcoin!

669
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:15,980
Oh no!

670
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:17,390
Money.

671
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,390
Our money!

672
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,630
Money!

673
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,460
You two only care about money.

674
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,780
What stupid Bitcoin?

675
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,780
Can you guys show some ambition?

676
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,590
What's going on?

677
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:29,870
Ignore them.

678
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,300
Stop using the electric stove.

679
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:31,910
Power is out.

680
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,110
You're still drinking?

681
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,460
Where's Daji?

682
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,110
Where's Daji?

683
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,020
She went out.

684
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,390
It's late.

685
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,630
It's already 11.30 PM.

686
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,870
No, the subway and bus services
have stopped.

687
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,190
How is she getting home from work?

688
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:50,980
Open the door!

689
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,220
Open the door!

690
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,830
Open the door! Open it!

691
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,950
(Zhou Shui)
Open it!

692
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,390
Open the door!

693
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,950
You're already here.

694
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:03,950
Open it!

695
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,460
Is that you guys?

696
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,460
Hello.

697
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,590
The number you dialed is powered off.

698
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:20,540
Hello.

699
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,300
The number you dialed is powered off.

700
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,880
(Zhou Shui)

701
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,670
Are you coming out?

702
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:29,910
Come out yourself. I warn you.

703
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,500
Don't make me go in.

704
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:32,590
Open the door!

705
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,220
Hello.

706
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,020
The number you dialed is powered off.

707
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,670
Hello.

708
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,630
The number you dialed is powered off.

709
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,860
(Calling 110)

710
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:27,950
Leyi!

711
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,630
Tong Leyi!

712
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,460
Leyi!

713
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,110
Are you okay?

714
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,120
What did he do to you?

715
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,260
What happened?

716
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,670
You pervert, you trash.

717
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,830
How dare you molest me?

718
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,350
Do you know that I know martial arts?

719
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,670
You jerk!

720
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,350
Su Zihao, you still
have to take the civil service exam.

721
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,740
Just wait and see.
I'll expose you when I get back.

722
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:03,830
I'm sorry.

723
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,020
Zihao.

724
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,190
Don't stop me!

725
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:06,980
Let's go!

726
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,260
Daji.

727
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,780
Dai Daji.

728
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:22,980
Yang Yiming.

729
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,590
Yang Yiming!

730
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,980
Open the door, Yang Yiming!

731
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,060
Yang Yiming.

732
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,780
Yang Yiming!

733
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,110
Open the door, Yang Yiming!

734
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,220
Open the door, Yang Yiming!

735
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,020
Daji.

736
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,630
Yang Yiming, open the door!

737
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,150
Dai Daji.

738
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,190
Daji!

739
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,390
Bro, why are you here?

740
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,830
Where's Daji?

741
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,500
Did I let you in?

742
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,980
You're breaking the law.

743
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,780
Dai Daji.

744
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,150
Daji!

745
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,740
She left this here.

746
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:27,980
Give it back to her.

747
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,830
Where is she?

748
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,670
What did you do?

749
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,150
I asked you what you did. Where is she?

750
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:36,060
Ask her.
It wasn't me who took the initiative.

751
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,300
Beating people is against the law.

752
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,390
In Beijing,

753
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,630
you won't be able

754
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,300
to keep a girl if you're incapable.

755
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,540
Alright, go.

756
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,220
Things will get worse
if the police comes.

757
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,390
Leyi.

758
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:09,740
Leyi.

759
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,540
What happened?

760
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,910
It's okay. It's all over.

761
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,190
It's okay now. It's all over.

762
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,590
You're okay now.

763
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,500
It's alright now.

764
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,460
It's alright now.

765
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:27,540
(July 23, 2009.)

766
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:28,980
(Great heat.)

767
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,180
(That night, the penniless me)

768
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:35,310
(Puhuangyu Road)
(walked aimlessly on Beijing's streets.)

769
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,660
(Jianguomen Inner Street)
(I don't remember how many streets)

770
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,750
(West Chang'an Street)
(and alleys I walked through.)

771
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:45,540
(Fuxingmen Street)
(I only vaguely remember)

772
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:48,060
(the hot and humid night wind
blowing toward me.)

773
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:52,350
(I found it freezing cold.)

774
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,460
(In that era without WeChat Pay)

775
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,100
(and Baidu Maps,)

776
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,870
(Beijing is so big)

777
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,870
(that I got lost
in the streets of Beijing.)

778
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,020
(I can't find my way home,)

779
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,180
(nor can we find each other.)

780
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,580
(East Chang'an Street)

781
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,540
(When I needed to be saved the most,)

782
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,710
(Zhou Shui hung up on me.)

783
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,870
(The person
who shines brightly in my world)

784
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:00,350
(gradually becomes blurry and dim.)

785
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,390
(Because of those bitcoins,)

786
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,020
(the phone that never charged)

787
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,540
(made me miss Daji's calls.)

788
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,500
(Fate seemed to play a joke on us.)

789
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,180
(And our love suffered.)

790
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,800
(Pulp Fiction)

791
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:13,710
Zhou Shui.

792
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,980
I want to break up with you.

793
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,790
After I finish this bottle of liquor,

794
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,230
we're done.

795
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,980
I won't owe you anything.

796
00:37:54,740 --> 00:38:05,300
(Dramatic Effect, Please Do Not Imitate)

797
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,710
Stop drinking, Dai Daji.

798
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,430
Stop drinking.

799
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,830
It'll kill you if you continue.

800
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:25,910
Stop drinking.

801
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,430
Let go!

802
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,180
Give me!

803
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,230
What are you trying to do?

804
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,230
What are you doing?

805
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,430
Have I finished drinking?

806
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,270
No.

807
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:22,950
Zhou Shui.

808
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,910
Shall we make a rule?

809
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,180
Whoever dares to mention break up

810
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:38,540
will have to finish
a whole bottle of Erguotou.

811
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:27,540
(Erguotou)

812
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:31,240
(Congratulations on winning
the script competition.)

813
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:35,300
(Please contact us as soon as possible.
Late replies will not be dealt with.)

814
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,310
(Our weaknesses)

815
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,540
(are exposed in front of love.)

816
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,310
(The sun)

817
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,830
(was blazing outside the window,)

818
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,830

in the coldest days of winter.)
