3
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,300
(Su Zihao)

4
00:01:53,540 --> 00:02:00,460
(Summer 2024, Beijing)

5
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,380
Hello, Su Zihao.

6
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,150
Tong Leyi.

7
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,950
What's up?

8
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,420
Anything wrong?

9
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,700
Nothing.

10
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,820
I just called to chat.

11
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,260
What are you doing?

12
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,860
I'm looking for a job.

13
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,790
You landed a stable job now.
Are you happy?

14
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,420
I'm not.

15
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,190
It's kind of boring.

16
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,630
I don't know what I'm doing every day.

17
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,580
I feel the same.

18
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,100
I just used AI to write a report,

19
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:32,910
but

20
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,140
it mistakenly wrote

21
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,540
my superior's name as Zhou Shui.

22
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,660
It still remembers
the Scandalous Couple.

23
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,420
The data must be in the system.

24
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,580
It probably won't
forget them anytime soon.

25
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,350
What do you think

26
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,310
Zhou Shui and Daji are like now?

27
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,950
Should we run a prediction?

28
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,420
Good idea. Do it now.

29
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,820
Zhou Shui and Daji

30
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,860
should be around 40 now.

31
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,820
I remember Daji is 39.

32
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,420
Zhou Shui is a year younger, so 38.

33
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,380
It's out.

34
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,190
Read them.

35
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,100
Daji is now

36
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,860
a frontline civil servant
in Ezhou, Hubei,

37
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,820
and her husband is also a civil servant.

38
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,310
They have two kids.

39
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,910
That sounds a lot like my future.

40
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,260
What about Zhou Shui?

41
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,070
Zhou Shui is a successful director.

42
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,630
He's made a bunch of popular movies.

43
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,950
He lives in a villa in Shunyi, Beijing.

44
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,860
He has no kids and never married,

45
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,950
but his weight has changed a lot.

46
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,070
He's become a greasy middle-aged man,

47
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,820
right?

48
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,380
Carrying a bead bracelet

49
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,950
and flirting with girls.

50
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,910
It's like my dad.

51
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,510
I bet Daji is like my mom.

52
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,510
Always getting facials.

53
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,540
Besides,

54
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,700
she might even have gotten
her eyebrows tattooed.

55
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,820
I bet Zhou Shui is balding now.

56
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,700
He must be a bald fellow.

57
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,420
With a little mustache.

58
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,050
Probably trying to imitate Wong Kar-wai,

59
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,790
wearing sunglasses everywhere.

60
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,860
My goodness.

61
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,030
I'm going to sleep. Bye.

62
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,300
(Spring 2010, Ezhou)
(Chinese skaters Shen Xue)

63
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,110
(and Zhao Hongbo,
break records with 216.57)

64
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,140
(and win the Olympic
pair figure skating.)

65
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,780
There's nothing for me to do.

66
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,020
They don't trust me

67
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,550
or my abilities.

68
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,630
What are you looking at?

69
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,430
Someone's coming. Don't say anything.

70
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:40,990
Who?

71
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,750
He's here.

72
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,990
Who's coming?

73
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,460
Coming.

74
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,260
Mrs. Dai.

75
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,460
Hello.

76
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,580
Come on in.

77
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,780
You're too kind to buy so many things.

78
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,310
Just a little something.

79
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,140
You're too kind.

80
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:55,870
That's too much.

81
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:56,990
It's nothing.

82
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,630
Dai Daji, my daughter.

83
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,820
Hello.

84
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,800
- Yi Shu.
- He's Yi Shu.

85
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,110
What?

86
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,070
Oh, Yi Shu?

87
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,140
Come and sit.

88
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,950
Please sit, Mrs. Dai.

89
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:11,990
Daji,

90
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,190
do something.

91
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,510
What?

92
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,580
Weren't you talking about

93
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,190
your work issue?

94
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,550
He might help.

95
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,020
Isn't your uncle her supervisor?

96
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,070
Tell him and your problem
will be solved.

97
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,780
No need.

98
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,820
No need for the trouble.

99
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,820
It's fine.

100
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,580
As long as I can help,

101
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,580
I'll do it.

102
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,020
It's fine.

103
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,310
It's not a big deal.

104
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,670
I can quit the job.

105
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,340
She's a girl. She cares
about her pride, you know?

106
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:37,700
Sure.

107
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,900
I hope you don't mind.

108
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,780
I'm like this.

109
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,870
I don't care about my pride.

110
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,380
What nonsense are you talking about?

111
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,750
Mrs. Dai,

112
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,900
I don't know if you drink or not.

113
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:52,870
Well.

114
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,750
I don't drink.

115
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,550
This is from my friend's distillery.

116
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,110
Fine liquor.

117
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:56,950
It's not for sale.

118
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,550
Take a look.

119
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,630
If you like it,

120
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,120
I'll bring you a whole box next time.

121
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,780
Keep it here.

122
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,380
Very well. I love drinking.

123
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,340
Perfect. I really like this gift.

124
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,220
- Liqupr?
- Dai Daji,

125
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,070
what are you doing?

126
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,380
This is good.

127
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,510
Premium liquor for guests.

128
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,550
You really got me.

129
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,780
I love drinking.

130
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,380
I can't go a day without it.

131
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,820
You could even say I'm an alcoholic.

132
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,510
Oh, that's impressive.

133
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,510
Mrs. Dai, you must also
be a good drinker.

134
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,730
She holds her liquor pretty well.

135
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:26,990
Impressive.

136
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,310
You... Maybe

137
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,070
I should join you.

138
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,670
Sure.

139
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,430
Come on.

140
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,820
Take that glass. Come on.

141
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,870
- Drink some.
- I'll pass.

142
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,870
You guys go ahead.

143
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,510
I suddenly can't handle it anymore.

144
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,990
She drank too fast, right?

145
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,380
Next time.

146
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,700
I'll put this away.

147
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,460
My daughter does whatever she wants.

148
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,820
I spoiled her when she was little.

149
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,820
She's good, Mrs. Dai.

150
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,580
It's good.

151
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:52,990
I actually

152
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,670
like that about her.

153
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,630
Really?

154
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,950
She's always been this way.

155
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,630
She's just carefree.

156
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,630
A lot of girls these days

157
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,340
are a bit boring.

158
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,310
I don't even know
what to talk to them about.

159
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,550
Right? I think she's good.

160
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,340
She's pretty good.

161
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,380
That's great, Daji.

162
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,340
I didn't know

163
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,900
you liked this kind of personality.

164
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,510
Careful.

165
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,510
I'm good.

166
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:18,990
You sure?

167
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:19,750
Yes, I'm fine.

168
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,460
No need to see me off. Head back.

169
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,510
Are you sure you're okay?

170
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,700
Of course.

171
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,580
I'm just a little tipsy.

172
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:26,340
Well.

173
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,190
Thank you.

174
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,070
Be careful then.

175
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,020
All right.

176
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,220
I wasn't sure

177
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,750
what kind of coffee you liked,

178
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,220
so I bought two.

179
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,070
One latte and one Americano.

180
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,430
Which one do you prefer?

181
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,820
I'll have the latte.

182
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,190
Sure.

183
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,550
I leave this one here.

184
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,750
You can drink it later.

185
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,340
All right.

186
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,110
Your mom said

187
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,070
you worked

188
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,500
at a broadcast station
in Beijing before.

189
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,500
Yes.

190
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,270
We are quite fated.

191
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,190
You worked at a broadcast station,

192
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,230
and I've always loved watching TV
since I was a kid.

193
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,430
Do you listen to music?

194
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,580
Yes.

195
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,580
You like music?

196
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,820
I like it too.

197
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,220
- Really?
- Let me play something.

198
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,860
This one is nice.

199
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,580
I've been listening to this
while driving.

200
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,340
Oh, this type?

201
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,150
I really this type.

202
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,430
Strong rhythm.

203
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,580
Yes, pretty strong.

204
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,190
It feels great while driving.

205
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,460
You have fine taste.

206
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,670
We're on the same wavelength.

207
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,670
Yes, right.

208
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,910
Yeah.

209
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,500
Over the past few days,

210
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,340
we've gone out for meals four times

211
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,310
and have had Starbucks twice.

212
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,860
There's no Starbucks here,

213
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,430
so he drove more than 200 kilometers

214
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,740
to take me to the capital for it.

215
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,950
(Actually, he's quite interesting.)

216
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,740
(But I always feel like)

217
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,980
(we don't belong in the same world.)

218
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,190
(This isn't Beijing.)

219
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,190
(The worst-case scenario
would be mistreatment)

220
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,910
(and no future.)

221
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,950
(I thought coming back home)

222
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,740
(would feel like
returning to my own turf.)

223
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,740
(Little did I know,)

224
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,820
(even a light bulb
goes against me here.)

225
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,340
I heard that you met my nephew

226
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,310
a few days ago.

227
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,790
What was it going?

228
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,820
Pretty good.

229
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:19,460
Well,

230
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,270
I just want to know

231
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,150
how things are progressing
between you two.

232
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,220
Well.

233
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,790
Sir, is my proposal okay?

234
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,270
If it's not, I'll revise it.

235
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,190
Work is work,

236
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,460
but still,

237
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,430
don't let it affect important matters.

238
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,580
How about this?
I'll come through it at home.

239
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,330
If there's anything wrong,
I'll revise it.

240
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,150
Just don't let it affect
the real business.

241
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,620
(Since I'm back,)

242
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,980
(should I accept the reality)

243
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,860
(and start over?)

244
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,910
Okay.

245
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,820
Well, it's here.

246
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,270
I'm going back, then.

247
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,150
Take care.

248
00:10:59,150 --> 00:10:59,790
Sure.

249
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,500
Drive safely.

250
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:07,950
Yes?

251
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,790
Are you going straight back?

252
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,500
Yes.

253
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,700
Do you have plans tonight?

254
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,600
No, everything is done.

255
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,190
How about coming up to my place?

256
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,200
You always see me home,
yet I haven't invited you in.

257
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,740
It's fine. If you don't have time...

258
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,340
No, I don't have anything to do.

259
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,100
No?

260
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,150
Well, let's go.

261
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,070
Well,

262
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,340
sometimes it works,
sometimes it doesn't.

263
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,790
Didn't you get someone to fix it?

264
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:34,820
I did,

265
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,550
but the connection is still bad.

266
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,950
Here we are.

267
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,390
Daji.

268
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,220
Who is this?

269
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,100
He... He's...

270
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,030
I'm her cousin.

271
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,740
Your cousin?

272
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,100
Hi.

273
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,620
I'm Yi Shu.

274
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,670
Zhou Shui.

275
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,070
Hi.

276
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,340
Oh, Zhou Shui.

277
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,030
Hi.

278
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,860
I'm her...

279
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,500
Uh...

280
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,340
He's my boyfriend.

281
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,430
Nice to meet you.

282
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,950
- Hello.
- Hello.

283
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,070
- It's been a long journey, huh?
- Yeah.

284
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:19,670
Yi Shu,

285
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,790
these noodles are delicious.

286
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,910
Sorry, Zhou Shui.

287
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,070
I should've taken you to a better place.

288
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:25,620
It's fine.

289
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,500
We're all family. Don't be sorry.

290
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,460
When did you arrive?

291
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,740
I got here this morning.

292
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,220
Morning?

293
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,910
But I had to go through a lot
to find you.

294
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,390
I went to the Cultural Archive Center,

295
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,620
then to the Cultural Bureau,

296
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,790
then the Cultural Center,

297
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,190
and finally to the residential area

298
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,310
before I found you.

299
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,270
His accent.

300
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,820
You're not a local, right?

301
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,860
No, he's not.

302
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,030
Right.

303
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,310
But my ancestral home is here.

304
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,910
When my mom was young,

305
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,550
she went to Sichuan,

306
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,030
and we settled down there.

307
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,910
This is actually my first time back

308
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,700
in my beautiful hometown, Ezhou.

309
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,270
It's good that you came back here.

310
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:05,550
Right.

311
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,500
Why did you come here?

312
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,700
Who told you to come?

313
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,950
Shut up.

314
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,430
Get out of here after finishing this.

315
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,220
Did you hear me?

316
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,070
Don't talk to him like that.

317
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,340
Exactly.

318
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,580
What's wrong with me?

319
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,270
Yi Shu.

320
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,100
I'm new here.

321
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,530
This is my first time visiting here.

322
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,070
Without you two taking care of me,

323
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,150
I might

324
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,190
- be abducted.
- Shut your trap.

325
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,030
We're family.
Why are you shouting at him?

326
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,860
We're eating now.

327
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,100
What family? He...

328
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,340
He's lying.

329
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,390
Don't mind her.

330
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
Since you're here,

331
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,100
I'll arrange the best hotel for you.

332
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,150
No need.

333
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,150
Don't worry about him.

334
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,030
Just let him sleep

335
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,470
on the street and get hit by a car.

336
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,740
You must be kidding.

337
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,700
He's a liar.

338
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,930
Don't waste your breath on him.

339
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:52,130
Fine.

340
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,070
Let him get out of here.

341
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,500
If your cousin says that,

342
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,980
I can follow what she wishes.

343
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,030
Don't worry about me.

344
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,670
Well,

345
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,920
let me arrange your schedule

346
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,820
for the next few days.

347
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,310
No. No need.

348
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,320
That's the least I can do.

349
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,910
Thank you.

350
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,500
- Let him go back tomorrow.
- Thank you.

351
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,030
Yi Shu, you know so many people.

352
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,270
Thank you so much.

353
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,620
If you want anything to eat,

354
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,390
just order it.

355
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:08,860
Sure.

356
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,270
Yi Shu, just ignore him.

357
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,670
The rice noodles here

358
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,620
are really hot.

359
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,740
Hot, huh?

360
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,790
Perfect for you, hmph.

361
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,390
It's so hot. Just like you.

362
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,740
Hot.

363
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,910
Are you insane?

364
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,670
I got lovesick from missing you.

365
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,670
Zhou Shui, listen.

366
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,580
Stop your nonsense,

367
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,070
pack your things, and get lost.

368
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,100
Why did you come here?

369
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,190
You have no idea.

370
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,830
The weather in Beijing
has been terrible.

371
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,340
The air quality is so bad.

372
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,190
When I wake up,

373
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,580
I sneeze 40 or 50 times.

374
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,950
Then I remember you said

375
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,670
that your hometown have fresh air,

376
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,550
so I bought a ticket and came here.

377
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,790
I'm here on a vacation.

378
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,900
I even made a travel plan.

379
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,150
Go back tomorrow, you hear me?

380
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,030
Look at this.

381
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:03,580
Zhou Shui.

382
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,340
Lotus Mountain.

383
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,750
Guanyuan Pavilion, right?

384
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,030
I told to leave. Did you hear me?

385
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,340
Wuchang bream and Shawo.

386
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,740
What's Shawo Dousi?

387
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,310
What do you think of my boyfriend?

388
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:14,790
Pretty good.

389
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,700
Passionate, reliable,
and knows a lot of people.

390
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,790
He's more reliable

391
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,070
and more outstanding than you.

392
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,580
Besides, he has a job.

393
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,500
Do you have a job now?

394
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,100
I was recently hired by Shendu Pictures.

395
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,390
The best film company in Beijing.

396
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,390
I start next week.

397
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,910
Really? Congrats.

398
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,390
You're finally not jobless.

399
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,910
My company is desperate for talent.

400
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,070
They need someone as excellent as you.

401
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,700
Are you interested
in going back with me

402
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,860
and making movies together?

403
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,700
I'm not.

404
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,150
I'm doing great here.

405
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,550
No, you're not.

406
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,310
Who says? I'm doing great here.

407
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,270
You said it.

408
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,670
I never said that.

409
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,650
You said it on the phone.

410
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,740
When did I call you?

411
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,550
One day, when you were drunk.

412
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,210
One doesn't lie
when they are drunk, right?

413
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:58,060
(24 hours earlier)

414
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,340
Daji.

415
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,460
Daji.

416
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:07,740
Daji.

417
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,670
I know it's you.

418
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,220
Say something, Daji.

419
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,860
What's wrong?

420
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,310
What are you doing, Daji?

421
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,030
Are you okay?

422
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,790
Yeah.

423
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,390
I'm fine.

424
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,070
I...

425
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,030
I'm just good for nothing.

426
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,550
Here,

427
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,820
I'm even worse than that.

428
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,820
Who says that?

429
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,550
Who said you're good-for-nothing?

430
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,860
I did.

431
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,860
It was me.

432
00:16:59,190 --> 00:16:59,700
Daji.

433
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,910
Don't hang up.

434
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,150
Daji, I...

435
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,740
I didn't.

436
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,460
Come back to Beijing with me.

437
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,060
I won't.

438
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,700
I'm not going anywhere.

439
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,630
My home is here.

440
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,430
My mom is here.

441
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,060
My boyfriend is here. My job is here.

442
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,630
I'll spend my whole life here.

443
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,980
I'll never go back to Beijing.

444
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,870
Excuse me.

445
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,740
I'd like a room.

446
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,430
Give me a second.

447
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:03,740
OK.

448
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,910
I'll check you in shortly.

449
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:05,630
Just a second.

450
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,500
Do you serve hotpot here?

451
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,350
No, I made it myself.

452
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,350
Can you taste it for me?

453
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,590
Tell me if it tastes good.

454
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,190
I had my dinner. Thanks.

455
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,150
Just a taste.

456
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:17,870
I made it myself.

457
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:18,910
Please.

458
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:38,700
How is it?

459
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,060
Not quite there.

460
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,740
You're missing the soul of hotpot.

461
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,260
The soul of hotpot?

462
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,390
Hotpot has three key elements.

463
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,390
First, heat.

464
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,060
The hotter, the fresher.

465
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,060
Second, salt.

466
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,870
Too much of it

467
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:57,930
will turn the broth dull.

468
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,540
Too little of it,

469
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,500
and the taste is bland.

470
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,350
The most important

471
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,190
is chili pepper.

472
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,150
A good hotpot uses
at least three kinds of chili pepper.

473
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,700
Traditional hotpot

474
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,190
uses Erjingtiao, Bird's Eye Chili,
and bell pepper.

475
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,910
Popular and modern ones

476
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:13,830
use Shizhuhong.

477
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:17,110
The chili peppers you're using
aren't quite right.

478
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,460
Many good hotpots

479
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,390
use eight to nine
kinds of chili peppers.

480
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,590
Hold on.

481
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,870
Are you a professional hotpot chef?

482
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,260
I'm not,

483
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,950
but my dad is.

484
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,670
My family runs a hotpot restaurant.

485
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,390
Are you from Sichuan?

486
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:32,540
Yes, I am.

487
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,630
I'm from Chongqing.

488
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,590
The same hometown.

489
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,980
Yeah, from the same hometown.

490
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,740
In that case,

491
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,220
can you be my teacher?

492
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,150
You can stay here. I'll waive your rent.

493
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,390
Stay longer and teach me.

494
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,060
No,

495
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:43,980
thanks.

496
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,980
Actually, I'm here for some business.

497
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,740
What is it?

498
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,110
I need to find something I lost.

499
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,670
You lost

500
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,500
a girlfriend, right?

501
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,460
Let me guess.

502
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,950
She's a local here.

503
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,110
You two broke up in a big city,

504
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,980
and now you've come here

505
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,020
to win her back.

506
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,740
You guessed it exactly right.

507
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,910
I've been through the same thing.

508
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,260
That's why I'm running an inn here.

509
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,590
We all have things we can't let go.

510
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,540
We all refuse to give up.

511
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,220
Coming here was the right choice.

512
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,220
Look at me.

513
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,670
I won him back

514
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,020
and even opened this inn.

515
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,020
What exactly did you do?

516
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,540
Nothing special.

517
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,740
I made up my mind

518
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,060
to stay with him here.

519
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,500
Stay here?

520
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,740
Can you do that?

521
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,500
Yi...

522
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,300
Hi, Mrs. Dai.

523
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,670
Nice to meet you. The pleasure is mine.

524
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,460
Who are you?

525
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,460
I'm Zhou Shui.

526
00:20:59,460 --> 00:20:59,980
Zhou...

527
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,670
Are you out of your mind?

528
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,700
Didn't you two break up?

529
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:08,670
Mrs. Dai,

530
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:09,810
no rule says

531
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,500
you can't win her back
after breaking up.

532
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,220
Can a man marries
into a woman's family here?

533
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,700
Are you insane?

534
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,020
What is he on about?

535
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,830
If Daji wants to stay here,

536
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,260
I think I can

537
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,460
stay here too.

538
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,460
Aren't you in Beijing now?

539
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,590
Why would you suddenly want

540
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,300
to live in a small county town here?

541
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,680
Mrs. Dai, Daji said

542
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,670
if she stayed in Beijing,

543
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,750
you'd break her legs.

544
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,500
I thought about it.

545
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,830
Why not I stay here

546
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,430
and let my parents break mine?

547
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,950
Are you nuts?

548
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,220
Anything wrong with his brain?

549
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,980
Come inside.

550
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,260
Stop making a scene at the door.

551
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,120
Thank you, Mrs. Dai.

552
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,020
Nice yard, Mrs. Dai.

553
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,190
This must be your younger brother,

554
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,110
Dai Dali.

555
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,060
He's plumper than you described.

556
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,430
He understands what you're saying.

557
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,390
Go in.

558
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,540
Daji,

559
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,230
grab him a pair of chopsticks
and a bowl.

560
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,500
Sorry, Mrs. Dai.

561
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,950
I showed up at mealtime.

562
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,300
Have a seat.

563
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,190
Thank you, Mrs. Dai.

564
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,430
I don't care where you stay.

565
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,300
But

566
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,220
you're not getting into this house,

567
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,780
no matter what.

568
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,460
Why not, Mrs. Dai?

569
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,590
You asked why?

570
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,190
Do you have a house,

571
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:35,460
a car, or money?

572
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,300
I have ambition.

573
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,220
Mrs. Dai,

574
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,500
please give me some time.

575
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:40,740
I'll have them all.

576
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,150
Didn't I give you enough time?

577
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,830
Two years.

578
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,980
What do you have now?

579
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,340
Please give me two more years.

580
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,330
I'll definitely make it.

581
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:47,950
Sorry,

582
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,540
but Daiji can't wait.

583
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,740
And neither do I.

584
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,700
On top of that,

585
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,190
we have a suitable choice
available right now.

586
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,220
Mrs. Dai, I met him.

587
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,910
I may not have everything ready,

588
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,300
but my love for Daji is genuine.

589
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,150
Well...

590
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,700
I will earn money.

591
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,220
I only have one thing to ask of you.

592
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,780
If I meet your standards

593
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,150
before Daji has to get married,

594
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,980
please let her choose for herself.

595
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,060
Is that all right?

596
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:23,020
Well, sit down.

597
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,350
Calm down. Sit.

598
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,190
You must be tired from traveling.

599
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,700
Eat up.

600
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,220
Dig in.

601
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,190
Thank you, Mrs. Dai.

602
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,780
Nice cooking, Mrs. Dai.

603
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,020
Why did you describe your mom

604
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,950
as if she were a horrible monster?

605
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,460
She's pretty good and supportive of me.

606
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:54,910
I'll have my dad

607
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,190
send over some hotpot seasoning.

608
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,350
She'll support me even more.

609
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:57,830
Zhou Shui.

610
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,980
Why did you come here?

611
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:06,670
Daji,

612
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,060
I can now drink an Erguotou

613
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,390
in one go.

614
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,300
I thought I could forget everything,

615
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,830
but instead, I remember even more.

616
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,220
In 2007, when we were at Haikou Airport,

617
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,980
you asked me a question.
Do you remember?

618
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,020
What question?

619
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,150
You told me

620
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,630
you were from 2025,

621
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,190
and we had already broken up.

622
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,150
You asked me if everything we had
at that moment was worth it.

623
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,870
When did I ever ask something that dumb?

624
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,110
You did.

625
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,220
I recorded it.

626
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:37,950
Want to see?

627
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:38,700
No.

628
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,590
That means I really was from the future.

629
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,740
I was right at that time.

630
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,500
We did break up.

631
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,220
What if I say

632
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,300
I'm also from 2025?

633
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,190
Would you believe me?

634
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:52,630
Zhou Shui,

635
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,950
did something happen to you?

636
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,220
I mean it.

637
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,950
Humans invented time travel in 2025.

638
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,150
Tickets were 200 yuan.

639
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,150
Very cheap.

640
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,460
I bought ten at once.

641
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,540
I've traveled back many times.

642
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,300
I found myself in the past

643
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,110
and told him:

644
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,390
Don't trust improper hospitals.

645
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,830
I must take you to the best hospital.

646
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,110
Don't put money into private equity

647
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,220
or stocks.

648
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,190
Don't argue with you.

649
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,700
And never let you drink
that bottle of Erguotou.

650
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,870
And now, I'm here.

651
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,300
I just want to tell you

652
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,430
that we didn't break up.

653
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,700
Because I've changed

654
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,630
everything.

655
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,150
And in 2025,

656
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,430
we're still together.

657
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,350
We always are.

658
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,980
That's enough.

659
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,060
Stop it.

660
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:18,910
Mrs. Dai, I'm leaving.

661
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,190
Don't forget to get a haircut.

662
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,500
It's messy.

663
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,150
Dai Daji!

664
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,500
Who are you?

665
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,390
A dedicated teacher.

666
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,630
Am I sexy?

667
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,390
What do you mean?
You want to be a teacher?

668
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,910
I interviewed at No.3 Primary School.

669
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,360
They told me to wait for the results.

670
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,950
I've decided to stay in Ezhou.

671
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,590
You want to stay here? Who allows that?

672
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:06,700
Friends on the other side of the river,
what are you up to?

673
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,870
Can you hear me?

674
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,780
We can hear you!

675
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,500
Hello, students.

676
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,980
I'm your teacher, Mr. Zhou.

677
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,020
Zhou Shui, are you serious about this?

678
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,460
Weren't you going back to Beijing

679
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,740
to work at a film company?

680
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,350
I'm not going back.

681
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,110
I want to stay here.

682
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,540
What do you think about me
becoming a teacher?

683
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,110
Good!

684
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:34,110
It's a decent job
and has a proper workplace.

685
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,220
Can I buy a house

686
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,460
if I work as a teacher here?

687
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:38,910
Yes!

688
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,830
They pay teachers quite well.

689
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,980
Can I find a wife?

690
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:45,350
Yes!

691
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:48,020
Girls nowadays like finding a teacher
as a husband.

692
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,390
Zhou Shui, stop being childish.

693
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,950
You're a grown man. Don't shout.

694
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,220
You used to shout with me.

695
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,110
Embarrassed now?

696
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,390
So you're not making movies

697
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,830
and don't want to be a director now?

698
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,740
No.

699
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,700
But I can train

700
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:05,910
China's next-generation moviemakers.

701
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,220
I'll help them win Oscars.

702
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:13,350
Can a teacher like me

703
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,590
marry Dai Daji?

704
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,910
Who's getting married?

705
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,830
I'm getting married.

706
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,020
Who are you marrying?

707
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,950
I want to marry

708
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,350
Yi Shu!

709
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,220
We wish you

710
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,350
a happy

711
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,260
and long marriage!

712
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,220
What about us?

713
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,780
What us?

714
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,390
There's no more "us".

715
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,500
I get married,

716
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,250
and you make movies.

717
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,190
What's the point of it

718
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,630
if we're not together anymore?

719
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,430
Even life is meaningless.

720
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,460
What do you mean?

721
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,220
You don't want to live anymore?

722
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,220
Is this river deep?

723
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,740
Yes, very deep.

724
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,390
A lot of people die here every year.

725
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,430
What would happen if I jumped in?

726
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,630
You'd die.

727
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,670
Okay. Let's make a bet.

728
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,590
If I don't die when I jump in,

729
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,500
we'll get back together.

730
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,500
Zhou Shui, stop being childish.

731
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,190
It costs much
to save people out of here.

732
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,110
If you jump, I have to pay them
to pull you out.

733
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,150
There's money in my bag.

734
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,460
Use my money.

735
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,430
Zhou Shui.

736
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,700
Stop messing around.

737
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,460
I booked you a ticket.

738
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:07,980
Tomorrow's flight.

739
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,500
Go back to Beijing
and focus on your movies.

740
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,870
What's that saying again?

741
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,040
"Traveling across the vast desert
for a goal.

742
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,980
You'll go places
if you return to Beijing."

743
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,630
You've put on some weight.

744
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,830
Feeling good at home, right?

745
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,060
You eat well here.

746
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:41,220
I won't fit into this
if I get any fatter.

747
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,460
It looks fine on you.

748
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,430
Good.

749
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,740
Ms. Dai, your cousin is here.

750
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,150
He's here.

751
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,430
You don't have a cousin, though.

752
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,870
You haven't left yet?

753
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,590
Mrs. Dai.

754
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,260
We have to say goodbye.

755
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,540
I wish you a safe journey.

756
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,460
I wish you a happy life.

757
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,020
Thank you.

758
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:19,700
Don't dawdle.

759
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,350
He'll miss

760
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,460
his flight.

761
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,590
Yeah. If you take a cab,

762
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,110
go to the other side of the street.

763
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,150
Easier to get one there.

764
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,460
Or, you'll have to turn around.

765
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,150
- Okay.
- Okay.

766
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,060
Bye, Mrs. Dai.

767
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:30,910
Bye.

768
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,700
Zhou Shui!

769
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,190
Yes?

770
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,540
I'll visit you in Beijing
in a couple of years.

771
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:19,700
Sure.

772
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,430
What will you be like by then?

773
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,870
Same as now.

774
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,670
People in small towns
don't change much.

775
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:30,020
You can picture what it'll be like
in twenty years.

776
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,770
Will you gain weight
in a couple of years?

777
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,110
I try not to.

778
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,350
What about you?

779
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,150
I definitely won't.

780
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,700
Will you keep your hair long?

781
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:48,950
No.

782
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,590
It's comfortable now.

783
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,500
You won't perm your hair

784
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,760
like those women here, will you?

785
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,870
I think I will.

786
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,740
We all get perms once we're over thirty.

787
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,350
How about an eyebrow tattoo?

788
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,740
That'll be after fifty.

789
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,150
Will you have kids?

790
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:21,910
Probably.

791
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:22,980
Maybe two.

792
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,950
Will you continue making movies?

793
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,190
Of course.

794
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,910
Will you come to my premiere?

795
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:33,830
Yes.

796
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,150
I'll bring my two kids to see it.

797
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,190
Okay.

798
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,500
I'll teach them how to make movies.

799
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,390
No way!

800
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,390
If they dare to learn,

801
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,220
I'll break their legs.

802
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,910
Will you still remember me
many years later?

803
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,790
I... I'm not sure.

804
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,460
I always think...

805
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,390
What is it?

806
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,230
When you wear a wedding dress,

807
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,270
I should be the first one
to hold your hand.

Ma'am.

827
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:54,980
Take a look at this.

828
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,500
This is too expensive.

829
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,180
Too expensive.

830
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,350
It's a total rip-off.

831
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,020
We have cheaper ones.

832
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,230
But they don't look as good.

833
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,180
Okay. I'll talk to you later.

834
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,790
This set looks nice.

835
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,540
So gorgeous.

836
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,580
Not bad, right?

837
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,620
It's really gorgeous.

838
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,140
Very good.

839
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,390
He's gone?

840
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,910
Yes.

841
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,950
What do you think about this one?

842
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,950
Yeah. Let's go with this one.

843
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,140
Look at a few more.

844
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,350
There are so many options here.

845
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,950
I don't feel like choosing anymore.

846
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,310
Anyway, it's just for one day.

847
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,350
Silly,

848
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,390
all the more reason

849
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,100
you should pick carefully.

850
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:43,870
You have no idea

851
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,710
how much I envy you
for wearing a wedding gown.

852
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,060
You know what?

853
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,750
I've never got to wear one in my life.

854
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,750
Before your dad and I married,

855
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:53,980
we only met a couple of times.

856
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,540
Then we bought some wedding candy

857
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,620
and had a meal with family.

858
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,870
That was our wedding.

859
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,310
After that, we had you.

860
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,140
You don't know

861
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,310
how mischievous you were

862
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,500
when you were a kid.

863
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,430
Since you were born,

864
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,910
the whole house was a mess.

865
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,620
We even burned a few pots.

866
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,140
Look

867
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,980
how time flies.

868
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,620
My girl is getting married now.

869
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,750
Mom, I'm sorry.

870
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,460
Why are you saying that?

871
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:20,540
We are

872
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,270
mother and daughter.

873
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,950
There's no need for this.

874
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,310
I used to...

875
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,540
I used to be so selfish.

876
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:30,710
I always thought about

877
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,140
what kind of life I wanted.

878
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,140
I never considered you.

879
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,620
From now on,

880
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,390
I'll stay with you.

881
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,830
I'm not going anywhere.

882
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,540
What nonsense are you talking about?

883
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,310
Young people should be selfish.

884
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,180
Love who you want to love.

885
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,750
Do what you want to do.

886
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,790
By the time you are my age,

887
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,460
you won't have the energy

888
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:55,140
to love someone or do anything.

889
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:55,930
Do you understand?

890
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,790
You will regret it.

891
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,230
Mom,

892
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,310
can I be honest with you?

893
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,230
I already regret it.

894
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,430
I want to give it another try.

895
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,270
Go ahead and try.

896
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,950
Go now.

897
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,430
I support you, all right?

898
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,350
I'll go change.

899
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,500
No time for that.

900
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,870
Run. The plane is about to take off.

901
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,750
Run already!

902
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,710
Thank you, Mom.

903
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,270
Hurry!

904
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,430
Zhou Shui!

905
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,950
Zhou Shui!

906
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:41,790
Zhou Shui!

907
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,430
Zhou Shui!

908
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,140
I'll go to Beijing with you.

909
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:57,660
Sure!

910
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,060
Now, we're at

911
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,230
the third stop on Route A,

912
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,460
Yuzhou Academy.

913
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,100
It was built

914
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,660
during the Kangxi's reign
of the Qing Dynasty.

915
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:11,060
According to records,
there were over 3,000 books here.

916
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:11,580
It's also

917
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,750
a 4A-level scenic spot in our country.

918
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:14,750
Take a look at it.

919
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:15,710
Over here

920
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,100
is a small theater

921
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,350
where they used to perform operas.

922
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,020
Right.

923
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:22,430
You can take some pictures here.

924
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:30,950
Hello?

925
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,910
Su Zihao.

926
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,230
The AI was wrong.

927
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,390
What was wrong?

928
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,060
AI.

929
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,310
I've been looking for a job these days,

930
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,390
and I sent out many resumes online.

931
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:42,660
I finally got an interview
with a company today.

932
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,020
I'm at work right now.

933
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,020
Can I call you back later?

934
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,430
Listen to me first.

935
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,500
I logged into their company website

936
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,350
to check it out.

937
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,350
Guess what I saw?

938
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,310
What?

939
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:54,830
Check it on WeChat.
