00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,840
=Such A Good Love=

2
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,220
=Episode 5=

3
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,959
My friends,

4
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,599
we're going to rehearse
the exiting ceremony.

5
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,269
A sense of ceremony is compulsory.

6
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,069
Bride and groom, walk forward.

7
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,239
(Summer 2008, Beijing)

8
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,879
(After my camera was broken,)

9
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,429
(my dreams and my job)

10
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,140
(were crushed as well.)

11
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,039
(Reverb's job)

12
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,620
(was the closest straw I could grab.)

13
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,639
(I had no choice)

14
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,220
(but to hold on to it.)

15
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,359
Walk slowly. You can greet the guests.

16
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,380
You, come here.

17
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,590
- Hurry and come here.
- I'm calling for you.

18
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,119
Me?

19
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,750
Hello. Congratulations.

20
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,359
You'll make a short film
for our wedding, right?

21
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,839
That's right. You can call me Zhou.

22
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,869
We don't have high expectations.

23
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,399
We just want

24
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,430
sweet scenes you see in Korean dramas.

25
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,959
I hope I can make it
with a cinematic vibe.

26
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,679
Hey, I said I wanted
a Korean drama vibe.

27
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,920
What do you mean by that?
Do you not know how to do it?

28
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,280
I do have no idea how to create
a Korean drama vibe for you.

29
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,029
What are you doing here, then?

30
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,269
Dear, look at him.

31
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,309
We want a Korean drama vibe!

32
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,519
Follow my wife's instructions!

33
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,269
He can. Let me introduce him.

34
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,149
This is the movie director

35
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,799
that we've hired with plenty of money.

36
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,749
He has won awards before.

37
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,429
Is that so?

38
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,309
You guys want
a Korean drama vibe, right?

39
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,310
That's his expertise. Am I right?

40
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,029
Do it.

41
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,359
Yeah.

42
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,309
Hurry and do it!

43
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,899
- Here. Calm down.
- Can you do it or not?

44
00:03:03,899 --> 00:03:04,639
Yes, I can.

45
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,239
- Come on.
- Okay. Let me tell you this.

46
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,589
I want a Korean drama vibe.

47
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,839
The kind with pink bubbles.

48
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,149
Pink bubbles. Do you understand?

49
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,429
You mean Teletubbies?

50
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,239
- Hey! What was that?
- I'll handle this.

51
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,239
- What kind of attitude was that?
- What do you mean?

52
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,309
We paid you! We hired you
with a lot of money!

53
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,429
Scram if you can't do it!

54
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,269
Please wait.

55
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,590
Where did you guys hire them?

56
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,239
Brat,

57
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,190
I didn't call you here to make a movie.

58
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,429
Just satisfy their requests
and be done with it.

59
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,199
But how should I create
a Korean drama vibe?

60
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,989
What does that mean?

61
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,359
- If she wants...
- Are you done?

62
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,160
Do you expect me
to photoshop the bubbles?

63
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,840
Yeah. Do it.

64
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,929
Yeah, we're done discussing.

65
00:03:34,929 --> 00:03:36,520
- No problem.
- His Mandarin is terrible.

66
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,780
- He's a director from the U.S. Come.
- Let's do it, then.

67
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,149
Remember this.

68
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,869
Make me look like Song Hyekyo later.

69
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,119
Make my husband
look like Hyun Bin, got it?

70
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,380
Alright, Mr. Hyun.

71
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,060
My surname is Xie!

72
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,469
Are you an idiot?

73
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,399
What's going on up there?

74
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,749
Are you an idiot?

75
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,100
Dai Daji, stop hiding. Show yourself.

76
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,500
Director Wen.

77
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,820
Please go ahead.

78
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,780
Don't you guys know
what we're doing today?

79
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,919
Today we're shooting beauty models.

80
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,060
What's the product ad for today?

81
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,869
Hailan Beauty

82
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,839
Royal Seaweed Golden Hydrating Mask.

83
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,079
Don't you guys think something's off?

84
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,990
Yeah. Something's off.

85
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,709
Who will put on facial masks

86
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,709
with a revealing outfit
with thick makeup on?

87
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:20,990
What else are we supposed to do?

88
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,839
They want models with no makeup on.

89
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,469
No makeup!

90
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,870
Tell them to remove their makeup.
If not, you guys are fired!

91
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,230
We won't remove our makeup.

92
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,959
- Miss.
- Please have some water.

93
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,029
Please.

94
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,009
You guys didn't say
that we had to remove our makeup.

95
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:39,829
Put some sketchy,
unverified product on my face?

96
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:42,290
Can you afford to compensate us
if anything happens to our faces?

97
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,320
I spent 50 yuan
to get my makeup done in a hair salon.

98
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,439
Now, you want me to remove it?

99
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,149
- Sisters, can you just do us a favor?
- Who are you calling sisters?

100
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,029
Girls, there's another job coming in.

101
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:50,909
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

102
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,469
Wait. You can't just leave like this.

103
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,269
I'll give you guys an extra 50 yuan.

104
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,550
- Forget about it.
- 100 yuan? 150 yuan?

105
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,020
500 yuan, and it's a deal.

106
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,430
We don't have that much.

107
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,399
Is this okay?

108
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,149
Higher.

109
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,319
Higher?

110
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,109
Higher.

111
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,999
Higher?

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,399
- That's right.
- What about this?

113
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,789
- That looks nice.
- Okay?

114
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,670
- Can you go any higher?
- I'm at my limits.

115
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,319
Remember this.

116
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,229
This is my most beautiful angle.

117
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:17,959
Alright.

118
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,269
You need to highlight

119
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,519
my husband's long legs.

120
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,669
Make him look like
a Korean oppa who's 185 cm tall.

121
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,790
So, you need to lower the angle.

122
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,519
- Come. Give it a try.
- Let's try it.

123
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,880
- An elevated shot.
- Give it a try.

124
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,319
Come on. Highlight my long legs.

125
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,870
Long legs, huh?

126
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,839
Is this okay?

127
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,469
- You two are a perfect match.
- Lower.

128
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,999
Lower!

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,319
Crawl on the floor!

130
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,620
- Crawl down!
- Be careful.

131
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,349
Highlight my long legs!

132
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,670
Alright.

133
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,079
You look so cool.

134
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,750
Alright.

135
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,319
I have a question.

136
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,399
What should I do when you two
are in the same frame?

137
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,519
When we're in the same frame,

138
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,669
just film me from a high angle

139
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,319
and film him from a low angle.

140
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,959
If so, you two won't match on screen.

141
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,230
What should I do, then?

142
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,589
Just photoshop it.
Do you know how to use MeituPic?

143
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,959
- Yeah. Aren't you a director?
- OK. He can do that.

144
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,380
- How can I photoshop this?
- Leave if you can't do it!

145
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,229
They haven't paid us yet.

146
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,199
You better do it
if you want to make money.

147
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,319
I quit! I want to go home!

148
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,709
Yeah, I can do it.

149
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,079
- Stop being angry.
- Congratulations on your wedding.

150
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,029
What do you mean by they're gone?
The brand dealers will arrive soon.

151
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,349
What do you expect them to do?

152
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,199
Do you want them
to stare at each other on stage?

153
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,269
Now, we can't do anything.

154
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,080
Do you want the production team
to pay the price for your stupidity?

155
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,269
Director Wen, give me a second.

156
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,060
I have a backup plan.

157
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,550
Jingshu.

158
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,700
Jingshu?

159
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,430
Don't be nervous.

160
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,060
Director Wen, take a look.

161
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,940
What do you think about her?

162
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,559
Hello. My name is Shen Jingshu.

163
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,029
Come again?

164
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,430
Shen Jingshu.

165
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,550
My name comes from a line
in the Book of Songs.

166
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,999
"The reticent girl is truly lovely.

167
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,620
She waits for me at a city corner.

168
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,670
She hides so that I can't see her,
and I get puzzled and antsy."

169
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,149
Alright. We'll use her.

170
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,380
Get ready.

171
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,999
Jingshu, it's fine.
There's nothing you need to worry about.

172
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,430
Just remember to hold this logo
in the correct position.

173
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,199
- Like this?
- Good. Don't be nervous.

174
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,589
Now, Beautiful.

175
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,029
Next,

176
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:07,879
let us welcome

177
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,260
our special guest for the night.

178
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,439
A new revolution in skin whitening,

179
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,460
a new approach to hydration.

180
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,910
In seven days,
it'll turn you into Snow White.

181
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,909
Dry and dull skin?

182
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,029
There's no need to fear.

183
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,839
Oily skin during hot weathers?

184
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,990
There's no need to fear.

185
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,439
Hailan Beauty Royal Seaweed
Golden Hydrating Mask

186
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,060
knows you the best.

187
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,700
Thank you for introducing
such a great product.

188
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,319
Not bad at all.

189
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,620
She did great.

190
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,020
Daji!

191
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,669
- Hold this for me.
- One, two, three.

192
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,659
- What's wrong?
- Can't you even do some basic Math?

193
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:53,269
Hurry. We're in trouble.

194
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,160
- What happened?
- What if we can't resolve the issue?

195
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,670
- What's going on?
- You!

196
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,350
You're in charge of
the product placement, right?

197
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,430
I...

198
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,199
What's wrong?

199
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,709
We brought four
new necklaces here today.

200
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,519
Why are there only three left?

201
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,870
There's also a platinum one.

202
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,230
That can't be.
We placed everything on the table.

203
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,910
Why would one be missing?

204
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,359
I think... I'm sure it's still here.

205
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:16,900
We placed everything on the dressing table.
Didn't you search it thoroughly?

206
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,789
I did. It's not here.

207
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,589
It's not here?

208
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,060
You have to take responsibility.

209
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:23,639
How?

210
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,820
You have to compensate us.

211
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,519
Me?

212
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,079
This necklace costs over 10,000 yuan.

213
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,380
I can't afford to compensate you.

214
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,190
I don't care.

215
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,039
Miss, I'm just an intern.

216
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,510
I only make 200 yuan per episode we do.

217
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,340
I can't afford
to compensate you for this.

218
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,839
- And, it's not my fault...
- Fine.

219
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,910
Forget it.

220
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,060
I'll talk to Director Wen.

221
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,629
- Director Wen!
- Wait!

222
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,199
Please don't!
Please don't look for Director Wen.

223
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,109
What about this?
I'll think of something.

224
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,820
You better come up with a solution.

225
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,060
Don't fall behind.

226
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,030
Please don't tell Director Wen.
Thank you.

227
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,630
What's going on?

228
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,940
Daji,

229
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,079
calm down.

230
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,709
You can have my pay this time.

231
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,439
No way.

232
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,959
I'll get angry if you keep doing this.

233
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,310
Hurry and keep it away.

234
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,060
What's yours is yours.

235
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,340
I'll come up with a solution.

236
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,989
Like what? Let's head back
and discuss this with Zhou Shui.

237
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,989
No.

238
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,510
You mustn't tell him.

239
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,060
He's busy with a movie shooting lately.

240
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,159
Ladies and gentlemen, the bride
and her father will enter the hall now.

241
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,390
Please give them a big hand.

242
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,199
She looks so beautiful today.

243
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,559
Yeah!

244
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,469
Groom,

245
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,460
go and receive your wife.

246
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,559
My friends,

247
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,439
let's give him a big hand.

248
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,550
Excellent!

249
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,220
Give each other a deep embrace.

250
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,550
Groom, face your wife.

251
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,060
Look into her eyes.

252
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,150
Here you go.

253
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,919
Mister, how much do they cost?

254
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,199
It contains two meat and one vegetable.
15 yuan each.

255
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,340
It's that expensive?

256
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,910
How much do the buns cost?

257
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,469
The buns?
I'll charge you one yuan per bun.

258
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,959
Alright. I'll take two.

259
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,319
Okay.

260
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,550
Two buns, coming up.

261
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,559
The soup is free, right?

262
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,589
That's right.

263
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,860
You can serve yourself over there.

264
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,559
Dai Daji? I thought it was you
when I saw you from afar.

265
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,989
I never expected it to be you.

266
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,550
Aren't you Yiming?

267
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,039
Long time no see.

268
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,389
- We last met when...
- When I was trying to get into Beijing.

269
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,199
That's right.

270
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,120
My mom organized a meal with her colleagues.
Your mom brought you there.

271
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,980
- Let me serve you.
- What a coincidence.

272
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,919
Back then,
Mom told me to learn from you.

273
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,159
The wall of photos
right after our university's entrance

274
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,920
still has a photo of you
holding a guitar.

275
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,550
Don't bring that up.
It's so embarrassing.

276
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,989
What are you doing here?

277
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,229
I'm working here.

278
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,749
What's with your meal?

279
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,190
How could that fill your tummy?

280
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,679
I'm on a diet lately.

281
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,109
You know?

282
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,079
Alright. Thank you.

283
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,910
I should eat lighter food.

284
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,670
Yiming, what are you doing here, then?

285
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,559
The viewer rating of your show
has plummeted.

286
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,469
Your superior called me here
to discuss how

287
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,270
we should report it to our superiors.

288
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,790
Are you from the HQ?

289
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,940
I'm affiliated.

290
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,030
It's all for the sake
of my Beijing hukou.

291
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,839
So, you have a Beijing hukou now?

292
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,319
My goodness, Yiming.

293
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,190
I suppose you're a Beijinger now.

294
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,349
I guess so.

295
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,079
After all, I just bought a house here.

296
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,470
You already bought a house here?

297
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,480
I bought it by installments.
It isn't that expensive.

298
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,679
I'll invite you
once I'm done with the renovation.

299
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,910
Sure. You're so successful.

300
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,389
What about you? How are you doing?

301
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,279
What kind of position do you have?

302
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,559
I follow the director.

303
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,469
Basically, I'm her right-hand man.

304
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,670
Are you the assistant director?

305
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,199
You can put it that way.

306
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,580
- Anyway, I'm in the program department.
- Dai Daji!

307
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,100
You see? They need me all the time.

308
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,469
Director Wen.

309
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,679
The rubbish bin is full.

310
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,630
Don't you know
how to dispose of the trash?

311
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,839
Are you too free?

312
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,509
Where's my coffee?

313
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,960
But this is Long's job.

314
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,520
So, you intend to stay out of it
just because it isn't your job?

315
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,079
- I...
- You don't want to be an intern?

316
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,040
That's not it. I want to.

317
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,560
- I'll get you a cup of coffee.
- Hurry and clean the place up.

318
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,040
You don't have any drive and still
want to become a full-time employee?

319
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,960
- So, you're an intern.
- My internship will end soon.

320
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,560
I'll become an official employee after that.

321
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,060
By then, my lowest position
will be an assistant director.

322
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,670
Yiming, it's fine.
You should sit down. I'll do it.

323
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,349
I'm done.

324
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,679
I'll place your equipment here.

325
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,709
Don't call me again.

326
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,980
Brat.

327
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,039
This is your pay.

328
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,060
2,000 yuan.

329
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,220
I can't just let you work for nothing.

330
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,039
I guess you don't like money.

331
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,150
You're a noble and high-minded artist.

332
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,190
Reverb.

333
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,220
What's wrong?

334
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,190
I guess I can take the money.

335
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,820
What did you say?

336
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,630
I already did the work.
Why should I refuse the money?

337
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,159
There's one more job in three days.

338
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,980
If you come, I'll pay you.

339
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,340
Thanks.

340
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,910
Hurry up.

341
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,580
Do you guys want to get off work or not?

342
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,389
(Necklace)

343
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,150
My goodness.

344
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,550
Daji!

345
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,439
I'm back.

346
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,700
You're back.

347
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,839
What a tiring day.

348
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,390
You should take a break.

349
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,790
What are you doing?

350
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,340
I'm looking at things
that are related to work.

351
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,550
Daji.

352
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,190
Your birthday is in a few more days.

353
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,869
Tell me what you want.

354
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,589
I don't want anything.

355
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,279
You see,

356
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,629
we have to be frugal.

357
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,589
Don't talk about the cost.

358
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,919
Just tell me what you want.

359
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,940
I don't want anything.

360
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,190
Let's drop the topic.

361
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,869
You filmed a movie today, right?

362
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,349
What did you film?

363
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,159
Do you have

364
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,580
any materials that I can see?

365
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,940
Where's your DV?

366
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,199
I did film a movie.

367
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,109
But I want to organize
the materials first.

368
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:00,799
It's fine.

369
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,469
I just want to see
what you've done today.

370
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,860
I'll just check out the footage.

371
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,150
- My DV is out of battery.
- Really?

372
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,150
It's...

373
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,959
I'll show you
the finished product later.

374
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,310
Don't be so impatient.

375
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,079
Alright.

376
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,310
Director Zhou, you have to work hard.
I'm waiting for your movie.

377
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,589
- Let's talk about your birthday.
- No. Let's talk about your movie.

378
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:24,279
Daji, you see, this is the first birthday
we're celebrating together.

379
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,109
I have to buy you a birthday present.

380
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,559
It's fine. You don't need to.

381
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,919
I don't need anything.

382
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,799
You need them, Daji.

383
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,589
I don't.

384
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,589
You need them.

385
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,030
I'll use the restroom.

386
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,109
Hurry and wash up.

387
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,109
Daji, think about it.

388
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,799
I'm serious.
Tell me when you've decided.

389
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,740
Alright. I'll tell you
when I've decided.

390
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,669
(The 2008 Beijing Olympics
officially ended.)

391
00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:35,199
(The Chinese delegation ranked first
in the gold medal standings)

392
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,039
(with a total of 48 gold medals,
22 silver medals,)

393
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,749
(and 30 bronze medals,)

394
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,079
(achieving China's best performance)

395
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,820
(in Olympic history.)

396
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,580
Hello? Who is this?

397
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,980
My surname is Dai.

398
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,039
I don't know anyone like that.

399
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,039
Mom, it's me.

400
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,799
I'm your dear daughter.

401
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,870
Mom.

402
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,519
Oh, I have a daughter, huh?

403
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,500
I almost forgot about it.

404
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,189
What? You're still alive, huh?

405
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,190
Mom.

406
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,070
Can you lend me

407
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,390
10,000 yuan?

408
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,629
How is that enough?

409
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,200
Why don't I transfer you
100 million yuan?

410
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,780
That's not it.

411
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:21,759
I...

412
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,999
You see, I...

413
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,589
I'm sorry, okay?

414
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,389
I'm sorry.

415
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,949
I know that I'm lending money from you,

416
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,999
and that I'm a total embarrassment.

417
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,149
But I'm truly in trouble.

418
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,799
Dai Daji, be honest with me.

419
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,589
What were you doing in Beijing?

420
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,629
I'm working there.

421
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,070
I'm working for the show
called "Beautiful."

422
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,869
So, you're working.

423
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,279
Even so, you're asking me for money?

424
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,239
Where's your own money?
How did you spend them?

425
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,949
I'm an intern, you know?

426
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:46,949
I'm just an intern.

427
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,719
My wage is very low.
I'm not even an official employee.

428
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,020
Have you got into a relationship?

429
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,500
How did you know?

430
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,839
You're asking me for money
when you're working.

431
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,039
It's not like you have no wage.

432
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,589
Your life is a total mess.

433
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,189
Of course you're doing this

434
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,590
for the sake of a stupid man.

435
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,429
No.

436
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,780
That's definitely not it.

437
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,279
I'll explain it to you later.

438
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,239
Anyway, right now,

439
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,109
I'm truly in a lot of trouble
and at my wit's end. That's why I'm begging you.

440
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,220
Would it kill you
to help me out just this time?

441
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,039
If you're in trouble,

442
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,560
why don't you find your boyfriend?

443
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,120
Why are you trying
to borrow money from me?

444
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,820
I don't have any money.
I'm not lending you any.

445
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,940
Mom!

446
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,350
Mom!

447
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,260
Deng Xiaoya!

448
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,980
I'll jump off the building!

449
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:50,780
Miss.

450
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,140
You see, I think you gave me less wage
than I was supposed to receive.

451
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,629
I make 300 yuan for each episode we record.
We've done 8 episodes.

452
00:18:57,629 --> 00:18:58,839
You should pay me 2,400 yuan.

453
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,630
Why did you only pay me 2,000 yuan?

454
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,039
I got it. I'll have my lunch first.
We can talk about it later.

455
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,719
Hey, you... You're having lunch first?

456
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,540
What's wrong with you?

457
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,940
Why are you standing there?

458
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,189
Yiming? What are you doing here?

459
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,150
I'm here to attend a meeting
with your HOD.

460
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,740
You haven't eaten yet, right?

461
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,630
I have.

462
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,279
I'm sure you haven't.

463
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,589
Don't be so courteous with me.

464
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,999
Come on. Let's go.

465
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,239
- I...
- It's my treat.

466
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:24,839
Let's go.

467
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,079
It doesn't change the fact
that I've eaten.

468
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,460
It's my first time
coming to Blue Harbor.

469
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,999
You're so courteous.

470
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,740
You're even buying me desserts.

471
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,109
Don't stand on ceremony.

472
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,999
Eat up.

473
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,869
Aren't desserts the craze nowadays?

474
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:38,870
Yeah.

475
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,540
Thank you, Yiming.

476
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,479
Look at you.

477
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,589
You devote yourself to work
the entire day.

478
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,909
You didn't eat well.

479
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,189
Why are you trying to tire yourself out?

480
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,589
I can't remain in Beijing
unless I strive hard.

481
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,300
There are plenty of ways
for you to remain in Beijing.

482
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,389
For example,

483
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,560
you can get married to a man
with a Beijing hukou.

484
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,149
After that, you can raise his children.

485
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,079
You can remain in Beijing
using that method as well.

486
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,110
No way. My boyfriend is from Sichuan.

487
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,540
So, you have a boyfriend, huh?

488
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,349
He's my university coursemate.

489
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,559
We came to Beijing together.

490
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,500
Is he working on the show
together with you?

491
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,110
No.

492
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,940
He has a different job.

493
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,070
He's a movie director.

494
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,740
A movie director?

495
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,780
That's pretty outstanding.

496
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,519
Has he directed any famous movies?

497
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,910
Any movies that I've seen before?

498
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,390
He's directing a movie now.

499
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,839
I'll invite you to its premiere

500
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,799
once it's ready.

501
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,870
Okay.

502
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,669
You're pretty confident in him, huh?

503
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,589
That's not it.

504
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,519
You see, you just haven't met him before.

505
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,869
If you do see him,

506
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,279
you can tell that he's talented
at first glance.

507
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,319
Look at you.

508
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,940
Your eyes are glowing
when you talk about him.

509
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,870
Do you idolize him?

510
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,390
It's not that serious.
I don't think I idolize him.

511
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,039
But,

512
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,390
he's quite different from us.

513
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,070
In what way?

514
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,669
Usually,

515
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,799
we only mind our own businesses.

516
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,910
We lead realistic lives.

517
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,350
We don't have any lofty aspirations.

518
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,020
But he's different.

519
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,390
His eyes radiate brilliance.

520
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,540
He has a story to tell.

521
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,719
He's a true idealist.

522
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,260
He's very charming.

523
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,839
I think he'll definitely be

524
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,670
an amazing movie director in the future.

525
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,319
- Mr. Zhou, come here.
- Coming.

526
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,669
Take photos of the couple
seeing their guests off.

527
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,300
- Alright. Give me a moment.
- That's right. That's the scene. Quickly.

528
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,519
Make it look nicer.

529
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,780
There are plenty of directors now, huh?

530
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,740
They even have a director
for a wedding ceremony.

531
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,780
Zhou Shui.

532
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,909
The wedding is over.

533
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,589
But you need to shoot
some footage of the guests eating.

534
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,630
Okay.

535
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,429
Come, Zhou Shui. Shoot some footage
of them clinking their glass. Come.

536
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,389
- Zhou Shui, over here.
- Alright. Don't worry.

537
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,909
- Shoot from this angle.
- Alright.

538
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,999
Give this dish a special feature.

539
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,910
Here.

540
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,070
Daji?

541
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,300
What are you doing here?

542
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,150
What are you doing here?

543
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,149
Mr. Zhou.

544
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,239
Are you filming a wedding?

545
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,189
Have you been filming weddings
for the past few days?

546
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,460
- That's not it.
- Zhou Shui.

547
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,589
- Sorry about this. I know.
- I won't let you do it!

548
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,630
Come here for a second.

549
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,559
Can you stop messing around?

550
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,830
- I'm still working.
- I'm not.

551
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,109
Why did you lie to me?

552
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,139
If I don't work now,
both of us won't make any money.

553
00:22:15,139 --> 00:22:17,239
We're barely surviving, you know?
What choice do I have?

554
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,960
I don't know
the kind of life you desire.

555
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,560
I want to be rich enough
to sleep in a room with air-conditioner,

556
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,020
to provide you with a good life,
and to buy you presents during your birthday.

557
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,190
I never wanted you
to buy any gifts for me.

558
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,000
What about the platinum necklace
on your laptop screen?

559
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,220
Isn't that what you desire?

560
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,620
I was checking that website

561
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,319
because our client's necklace
used as a product placement went missing.

562
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,220
They insisted on making me
compensate them for it.

563
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,980
If not, I'll lose my job.

564
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,540
That's a huge deal.
Why didn't you tell me about it?

565
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,519
Why should I tell you?

566
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,220
You have a movie to film.

567
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,109
I can't film movies now.

568
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,680
My DV is broken. I don't even
have enough money to repair it, Daji.

569
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,999
- Hurry up.
- When did that happen?

570
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,319
You didn't tell me about it either.

571
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,300
- That day, I...
- Brat, what are you doing?

572
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:56,999
Reverb.

573
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,189
I'll handle this, okay?

574
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,869
Girl, don't bother him.

575
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,110
- Your man is trying to make money now.
- What's going on?

576
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,419
Who are you?

577
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:05,799
- Who are you? Don't touch me.
- Wait!

578
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,839
Who are you? Don't touch me.

579
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,189
I know both of you.

580
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,719
This is my senior, Yang Yiming.

581
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,260
This is my boyfriend, Zhou Shui.

582
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,149
I've long heard of your name.
She mentioned you just now.

583
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,669
She said you were a movie director.

584
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:19,319
Why are you
a wedding video director now?

585
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,590
What are you doing?

586
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,500
Are you still doing it or not?

587
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,700
Can you be professional for once?

588
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,670
Where's the photographer?

589
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,589
Hurry up.
We have another job after this.

590
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,279
Hey, Mr. Zhou.

591
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,670
That's right! So what if
I'm a wedding video director?

592
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,869
Zhou Shui, what's wrong of you?

593
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,300
You were too mean.

594
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,900
(We got married)

595
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,500
Enough. Don't be angry.

596
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,500
Why don't we head back
and continue our meal?

597
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,190
She asked me why I didn't film movies.

598
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,350
She asked me why I went to make money.

599
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,500
Why can't she understand?

600
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,460
I understand

601
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,300
why he took on other jobs.

602
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,870
Actually, I wasn't angry at him.

603
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:34,020
I was angry at myself.

604
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,590
I said I would make money to support him

605
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,500
so that he could film movies.

606
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,190
But I'm not capable enough to do so.

607
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,460
I know she's under huge pressure.

608
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,390
She has to pay our rent,

609
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,190
provide for both of us,

610
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,390
and compensate her client
with an expensive necklace.

611
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,830
This should be
my responsibility as a man.

612
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,500
I just can't get used to the fact
that he's taking jobs.

613
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,630
He's a proud artist.

614
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,020
But in order to make money,

615
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,870
he has to bow down.

616
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,220
He's letting people ordering him around.

617
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,260
I don't want him
to become someone like that.

618
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,830
Happy birthday, Daji.

619
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,700
Thank you.

620
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,980
Today's your birthday.
Can you get off work early?

621
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,150
I don't know.

622
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,190
What about you?

623
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,540
Do you have wedding jobs today?

624
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:12,020
I'll try my best
to end it as soon as possible.

625
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,460
Alright, then.

626
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:30,580
(Spring 2024, Beijing)

627
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,909
The client is rushing us.

628
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,870
Therefore, we must be quick today.

629
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,279
Hello.

630
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,319
Tong Leyi asked me to come here.

631
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,239
Over here.

632
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,980
- Come here.
- Thank you.

633
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,590
You're actually having
a flash marriage, huh?

634
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,279
It's all because you didn't stop me
from praying to Yue Lao.

635
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,780
I had no choice but to take on
this wedding promotion.

636
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,260
Is it that effective?

637
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,350
Go inside and get changed.

638
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,479
What outfit am I changing into?

639
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,589
The groom's suit.

640
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,999
My male partner stood me up suddenly.

641
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,389
I couldn't find anyone else.

642
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,839
You have to be the one.

643
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,940
Go inside.

644
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,079
You must be kidding me.

645
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,460
I'm not.

646
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,830
Your hands should be closer.

647
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,559
I don't understand.

648
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,799
Being a wedding video director
is pretty lucrative.

649
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,350
Why did Zhou Shui and Daji argue, then?

650
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,870
Change your pose.

651
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,980
To Daji,

652
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,910
Zhou Shui is an artist.

653
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,540
His only job is to make movies.

654
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,430
She's just like my mother.

655
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,540
When I was young,
I wanted to learn skateboard.

656
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,759
She insisted on making me learn piano.

657
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,830
Closer.

658
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,629
Is Zhou Shui her son or her boyfriend?

659
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:47,319
Isn't this just like the lyrics
in "Mother Is The Best?"

660
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,430
Be serious. We're working.

661
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,460
Stand closer to me.

662
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,110
Okay.

663
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,239
Sorry about that.

664
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,190
I forgot that your mother
isn't around anymore.

665
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,700
It's fine.

666
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,719
Change your pose.

667
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,559
Face each other.

668
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,519
Okay.

669
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,150
Hold his hands.

670
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,940
Make it like a wedding. Say "Yes, I do."

671
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:15,870
I...

672
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,070
I...

673
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,460
Yes, I do.

674
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,479
What's wrong?

675
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,740
Zhang Shiyu!

676
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,109
What are you doing here?

677
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,719
Didn't you say you were
on a business trip?

678
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,759
Who's that?

679
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,629
So,

680
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,630
she's my daughter.

681
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,980
Who is he?

682
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,079
He's my colleague.

683
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,430
Hurry and greet Mr. Wang.

684
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,780
You two disgust me.

685
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,980
Let's go out another day.

686
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,279
Who's that?

687
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,239
My mother.

688
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,559
Wasn't she dead?

689
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,500
Where were we? Let's continue.

690
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:51,079
Do it. Say "Yes, I do."

691
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:51,980
I...

692
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,260
Out with it.

693
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,039
Yes, I do.

694
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,109
That's so fake.

695
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,740
"Yes, I do" is the fakest term
in the world.

696
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,910
Brat.

697
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,239
You did a good job today.

698
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,500
The client gave you
an extra 1,000 yuan bonus.

699
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,780
I knew you were talented.

700
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,830
Keep it up.

701
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,150
I can't do this job forever.

702
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,350
I'll say this first.

703
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,540
I'll quit after making enough

704
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,110
to buy Daji's necklace.

705
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,500
It's easy for you to say.

706
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:27,500
Why would you want to quit
when you're making money here?

707
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,980
There's another job tonight.
Remember to come.

708
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,980
Did you hear me?

709
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,540
What a stubborn boy.

710
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,020
So,

711
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,150
the brand dealer called us.

712
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,460
What did they say?

713
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,870
They said they would retrieve
the necklace this afternoon.

714
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,740
I'm done for.

715
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,350
I haven't saved up enough money yet.

716
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,949
I have an idea.

717
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,220
What is it?

718
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,589
They signed a contract
with our company, not us.

719
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,669
We're just interns.

720
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,079
We didn't sign
any labor contracts either.

721
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,910
They won't be able
to press charges against us.

722
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,020
I suggest you resign immediately.

723
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,830
You want me to leave?

724
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,460
Yeah.

725
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,070
But today's my birthday.

726
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,430
I don't want to lose
my job on my birthday.

727
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,780
Why must it be today?

728
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:41,860
(Transaction Notice:
You have received 10,000 yuan.)

729
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,452
(Mom: I'm doing this
for the sake of Beautiful.)

730
00:30:48,453 --> 00:30:51,620
(I'm donating the money to you as a fan
of the show. Do your best on the show.)

731
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,999
I'll buy you a meal next time.

732
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,949
Good job, Wen.

733
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,880
Look after your father.
He's a little drunk.

734
00:31:07,239 --> 00:31:09,039
Take note of this
when you clean up the venue.

735
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,519
Take care.

736
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,799
Put these wine bottles together.

737
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,190
- The groom wants to take them back.
- Okay.

738
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,589
Young man.

739
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,949
You're the best photographer here.

740
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,479
Can you help us
take another group photo?

741
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,349
- No problem.
- Okay.

742
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,109
Thank you so much.

743
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,319
Don't mention it.

744
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,239
In-law, come. We didn't take
any nice photos or eat well just now.

745
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,189
Come. Hurry.

746
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,319
Hurry. Come here.

747
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:28,759
Here.

748
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,940
Over here.

749
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,540
Okay.

750
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,949
Three, two, one.

751
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:35,559
Alright.

752
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,429
- Thank you, hunk.
- Good job. See if it's okay.

753
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,429
Yeah. This looks great. Thank you.

754
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,039
- I'll send it to you later. Congratulations.
- Thank you, young man.

755
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,949
Thank you.

756
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:43,629
Good job.

757
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,400
The next group
will enter the venue soon.

758
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,940
Everyone should hurry up.

759
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:47,940
I...

760
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,239
Where's my food?

761
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,110
Sorry. I've disposed of it.

762
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,239
It's fine.

763
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,390
Alright.

764
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,559
Can you clean up that table later?

765
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,429
Sure.

766
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,630
Thank you.

767
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:38,820
(Dramatic Effect, Please Do Not Imitate)

768
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,559
- What?
- Why are you here?

769
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,589
What are you doing here?

770
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,350
Aren't you going
to wish me Happy Birthday?

771
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,540
Happy birthday, Daji.

772
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,070
Let's go. I'll treat you to a feast.

773
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,559
Give me a second.

774
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,830
Let me keep my things.

775
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,670
Let's go.

776
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,430
What do you want to eat today?

777
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,719
What are you eating?

778
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,870
Mango.

779
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:08,949
Don't eat people's leftovers.

780
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,319
Come. Let's go and eat.

781
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,279
It's fine. There are plenty of food left.

782
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,429
We have a free feast here.
Why are we eating outside?

783
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:16,239
Stop eating them. They're cold.

784
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,559
It's free. I don't care if it's cold.

785
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,479
My goodness.

786
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,910
Hurry and sit down.

787
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,830
It's delicious.

788
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,110
There's chicken as well.

789
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,279
Eat up.

790
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,350
Why don't you dare
to go crazy with me anymore?

791
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,260
There's lobster as well.

792
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,079
Who said there's nothing left?

793
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,150
Fine.

794
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:43,980
I'll join you.

795
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:47,150
Let's drink, then.

796
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,350
Alright.

797
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,980
Cheers.

798
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,980
Happy birthday.

799
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,220
Let's do this.

800
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,420
I'm sorry.

801
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,590
For what?

802
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,469
You have to eat leftovers
on your birthday.

803
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,599
How are these leftovers?

804
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,070
We were just late.

805
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,639
I have to apologize to you instead.

806
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,199
All this while, you have
to film wedding videos

807
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,029
even though you're a movie director.

808
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,420
Even so, I blamed you.

809
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,990
I know you want me to film movies.

810
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,469
But I don't want my dreams

811
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,909
to become your burden.

812
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,679
Why would your dreams become my burden?

813
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,639
I'm glad to do so.

814
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,799
And, I'll tell you this.

815
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,839
From today onward,

816
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,469
you have to start making movies.

817
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:55,820
You can't use a broken camera
as your excuse anymore.

818
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,900
I bought you a new lens.

819
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:01,509
I...

820
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:04,520
Happy? Just tell me if you're experiencing
any difficulties in the future.

821
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,030
I said that I would support you.

822
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,990
But my camera is already gone.

823
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,030
Why is it gone?

824
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,630
Because I bought this for you.

825
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,860
You sold your DV?

826
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,909
You sold your DV just
to buy this stupid stuff for me?

827
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:29,639
What do you mean?

828
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,789
- Zhou Shui, are you an idiot?
- You're going overboard here.

829
00:35:32,789 --> 00:35:33,740
Who told you to buy it?

830
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,549
I thought you had
to compensate your client.

831
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,319
Why should I?

832
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,679
I'm just an intern.
I don't even have a contract.

833
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,199
I can just resign.

834
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,199
Why did you buy such
an expensive necklace for me?

835
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,869
How much do you earn
from shooting a wedding?

836
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,719
I make over 2,000 yuan per gig.

837
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,599
Over 2,000 yuan?

838
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,599
How much do you earn

839
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,719
from filming an episode?

840
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,239
300 yuan.

841
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,759
- Where did you get the money to buy this?
- My basic pay is 1,500 yuan.

842
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,839
1,500 yuan? Is that a lot?

843
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,159
You make 1,800 yuan per gig.

844
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,799
I make 2,000 yuan per gig.

845
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,429
That's not it.

846
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,799
I make eight episodes per month.

847
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,869
I make 2,400 yuan.

848
00:35:59,869 --> 00:36:01,869
- How much does this lens cost?
- Over 10,000 yuan.

849
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,830
How many episodes do you have
to make to afford this?

850
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,860
Get a refund.

851
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,260
I'm not doing it.

852
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,860
I won't bother with your request.

853
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:19,470
Thank you.

854
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,860
You're happy, right?

855
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,380
Happy birthday, Daji.

856
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,900
There's no one else here.

857
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,900
It's our train!

858
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:21,860
Work is over! Time to go home!

859
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:22,989
Zhou Shui,

860
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,719
you've filmed many weddings.

861
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,550
Have you ever imagined what kind
of wedding we would have?

862
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,070
Our wedding?

863
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,070
Our wedding is different from
all these conventional wedding.

864
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,349
I think our wedding

865
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:36,740
will be the most cinematic wedding
in history.

866
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,159
All the set designs should
look just like in the movies.

867
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,030
It's a dream and life at the same time.

868
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,510
Over here,

869
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,389
it's a sea.

870
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,279
A sea?

871
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,340
It's the sea we saw at Haikou.

872
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,909
Magic hour.

873
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,070
So beautiful.

874
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,820
Let's jump into the sea.

875
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,549
- I'm doing freestyle swimming.
- Really? I'll do breaststroke.

876
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,759
- I'll do butterfly stroke as well.
- Butterfly stroke?

877
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,900
I'll do backstroke.

878
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,780
This place

879
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:07,820
will be the little hotel
we stayed in together.

880
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:08,799
If so,

881
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,989
I should sit here and wait for you.

882
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,759
I remember
that I was sitting beside you.

883
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,900
After that, we...

884
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,159
I went to buy some stuff.

885
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,150
Wait. What did you buy?

886
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,719
Newspapers.

887
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,190
Newspapers, huh?

888
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:28,260
- After that...
- We covered the glass.

889
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,670
Okay.

890
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,510
- Okay.
- Cover all of it.

891
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:35,190
After that, we returned to the bed

892
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,380
and watched the first film I'd directed.

893
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,110
After that, I fell asleep.

894
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,900
Did you?

895
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,900
Got you. I didn't fall asleep.

896
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,190
After that, we'll proceed
to the next scene.

897
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,279
Over here.

898
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:58,719
Over here.

899
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,159
- Our unit at Chunzhili. What do you think?
- Okay.

900
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,420
By then, we need to invite
Dumbbell, Jingshu,

901
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,239
Glasses, Vest,

902
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,900
Old Chives, and the rest of them.

903
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,389
Do you still remember the fireworks
we set off together?

904
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,550
I do.

905
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,510
We enjoyed the fireworks together.

906
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,110
During that moment, we said,

907
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,740
"It's so beautiful.

908
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:19,070
If only we could remain here forever."

909
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,040
- Over here.
- Over here?

910
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,240
This is Tiananmen Square,

911
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,080
the first place we arrived at
when we came to Beijing.

912
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,909
- We met Scum there.
- That's right.

913
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:34,839
Over here

914
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,639
is Beijing's Shichahai.

915
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,069
It's our Shichahai.

916
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:38,759
That's right.

917
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,780
But we're on the edge of the sea!

918
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,599
Over here

919
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,590
is the balcony of the unit we rented.

920
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:47,949
We dry our clothes

921
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,429
on it!

922
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,349
All of them are our pants.

923
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,119
If so, the CCTV Tower
should be over there.

924
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,190
That's right. It's over there.

925
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,030
What a huge building.

926
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,950
The sunset is gorgeous.

927
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,030
Next,

928
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,990
I'll change into my suit.

929
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,070
So handsome.

930
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,670
If so, I'll change into
my wedding gown as well.

931
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:32,839
Next,

932
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,630
under the witness
of our family and friends,

933
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,820
we'll relive the wonderful experiences

934
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,860
we've been through together.

935
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:12,839
I'll help you put on

936
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,190
the ring I've prepared for you.

937
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,190
I'll also help you put on

938
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,380
the ring I've prepared for you.

939
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,340
(After that,)

940
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,420
(I attended many weddings.)

941
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,420
(Each time,)

942
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:50,719
(it reminded me)

943
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,380
(of this very moment.)

944
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,950
Everyone is in silence.

945
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,070
They're looking forward to us

946
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,780
uttering that term.

947
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,670
Yes, I do.

948
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,990
Yes, I do.

949
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,670
(After that day,)

950
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:37,860
(I never had a chance to say)

951
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,220
