00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,340
(Alarm)

4
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,030
Get up.

5
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,020
(Winter 2010, Yanjiao)

6
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,100
Come on, faster.

7
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,260
(Yanjiao is a really strange place.)

8
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,030
(It looks so close to Beijing.)

9
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,660
(If there's no traffic,)

10
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,560
(it only takes half an hour
from the China World to Yanjiao.)

11
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,470
(But out of the 365 days a year,)

12
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,630
(there are 360 days of traffic jams.)

13
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,470
(When it jams,)

14
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,310
(you never know how long it'll take.)

15
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,030
(The daily commute
from Yanjiao to Beijing)

16
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,230
(is just like our lives.)

17
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,120
(Traffic jams are the norm.)

18
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,640
(When there's no traffic, that's luck.)

19
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,420
I can't run anymore.

20
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,580
Keep going.
They'll deduct 50 yuan if you're late.

21
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,100
Can I treat it like I have spent it?

22
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,950
But they've already deducted
300 yuan this month.

23
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:26,700
What? 300?

24
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,660
Make a run for it!

25
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,750
You guys are here.

26
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,080
You too?

27
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,360
- We're all here. Hurry!
- Hurry!

28
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,230
This way!

29
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,260
The final five seconds!

30
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:34,910
Run for it!

31
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,070
It's five seconds after eight.

32
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,070
We're still late.

33
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,540
Zhaoyang, I really don't get it.

34
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,560
We give it our all every day.

35
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,560
It's not for making movies.
But clocking in for work.

36
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,720
Don't you think that's absurd?

37
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,080
Zhaoyang,

38
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,960
we've already made videos
that hit 100,000 views.

39
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,720
Why won't they confirm us
as regular employees?

40
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,680
Zhaoyang, is there
any shortcut to getting regular?

41
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,310
Right, is there?

42
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,560
What are you guys talking about?
Let's talk in the office.

43
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:01,910
Zhaoyang.

44
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,820
Close the door.

45
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,950
Why are you guys making noise outside?

46
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,700
I, Lai Zhaoyang,

47
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,100
joined the company at 28

48
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,790
and became a regular employee at 32.

49
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,750
I finally became
the editor-in-chief at 42.

50
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,380
You guys are my first team
of subordinates.

51
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,110
Do you think this office is spacious?

52
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,670
How dare you ask about shortcuts?

53
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,340
It wasn't easy for me either. Shortcuts?

54
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,510
We mainly don't want
to suffer like you did.

55
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,950
Shendu Pictures will never bury
anyone with talent.

56
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:27,700
Zhou Shui,

57
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,260
I've already signed you guys up
for this.

58
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,310
Shendu Pictures Creative Ideas.

59
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,550
What's this?

60
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,940
(Shendu Pictures Creative Ideas)

61
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,070
The company holds

62
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,670
a pitching competition every year
for all employees.

63
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,340
Ms. Zhou, from the highest management,

64
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,950
will personally review your work.

65
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,580
Do you know the film from last year

66
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,480
that sold for 300 million yuan
at the box office?

67
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,950
Ms. Zhou selected
the director and main team

68
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,750
from the initial Creative Ideas.

69
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,630
Got it?

70
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,430
Time to write scripts!

71
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,020
What's the point of writing this?

72
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,220
What do you mean by that?

73
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,070
What's wrong? What's your problem now,

74
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,720
Mr. Screenwriter?

75
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,280
Can we make
something more sophisticated?

76
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:10,660
Let's eat.

77
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,240
- Ze.
- I can't think of anything to write.

78
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,380
Ze.

79
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,990
It's not whether you can write it
or not.

80
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,700
Thanks.

81
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,190
Here's your coca cola, Xiaomao.

82
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,310
Xue Cheng, your spicy strips.

83
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,520
Thank you, Ms. Producer.

(Web Drama Department)
There's no problem with you.

85
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,870
(Before Creative Ideas,
everyone is equal.)

86
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,670
(Seize the opportunity,
and we could change our lives.)

87
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,580
(We rise with the wind,)

88
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,700
(inspirations soaring like angels,)

89
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,700
(and eventually,
they land in the mortal world.)

90
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,670
(Coincidentally,
they landed in Yanjiao.)

91
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,190
(And that's how
our first work came to be,)

("Yanjiao's Fallen Angel.")

93
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,020
- Boss, please.
- I told you it's not possible.

94
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,580
We're shooting at night.

95
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,120
So we won't interfere
with your business.

96
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,200
I can't allow you
to use my business premises like this.

97
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,340
Wait. Mister, think about it.

98
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,310
If you let us shoot here,

99
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,630
your name will forever be

100
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,280
in the history of Chinese cinema.

101
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,140
- No means no.
- You'll make a fortune, mister.

102
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,550
I said no.

103
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,190
We really need a location
with that Hong Kong, China vibe.

104
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,900
Give us a chance.

105
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,220
Coming!

106
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,780
The costumes are here.

107
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,870
- Huang, you're here.
- Hey, Huang.

108
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,380
- You're so righteous!
- Thank you so much, Huang.

109
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,260
It's no big deal.
Ze's problems are my problems.

110
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,040
These look pretty.

111
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,020
But this is too much.
Won't your employer scold you

112
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,190
for taking so much out?

113
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,260
If I get caught,

114
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,870
they'll just deduct my salary.

115
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,240
- It's okay. Just use them.
- Huang,

116
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,700
there's something unfortunate.

117
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,380
The owner of the tea house
with Hong Kong, China vibe rejected

118
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,260
our request.

119
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,700
We might have to change
the location to Wudaokou.

120
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,020
What?

121
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,320
Wait.

122
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,700
Without the Hong Kong, China vibe,

123
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,560
I can't pretend as Director Wang Jiawei.

124
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,670
Come on.

125
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,800
My camera only rolls
with the Hong Kong, China vibe.

126
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,220
Are you guys not able to shoot now?

127
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,070
It's okay.

128
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,760
- We have no funds.
- No money to roll?

129
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,580
We have some funds, right?

130
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,380
Take this.

131
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,020
That's a lot!

132
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,190
What are you doing?

133
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,070
Not enough?

134
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,340
Are you mad?

135
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,630
It's not that much.

136
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,110
Not that much?

137
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,140
That's your entire week's
living expenses.

138
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,670
That's a week's living expenses?

139
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,220
I'll just tell my mom

140
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,110
that I took the subway,

141
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,160
and I accidentally lost
my change purse.

142
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,080
What do you guys think?

143
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,110
A change purse?

144
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,780
Who keeps 2,000 yuan
in their change purse?

145
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,990
I need to take this call.

146
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,340
Hello?

147
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,950
Yes, it's me.

148
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,070
Yes, please go ahead.

149
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,020
Really?

150
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,990
Thank you! Thank you so much!

151
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,160
The tea house owner called me

152
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,820
and said he's agreed
for us to shoot there.

153
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,550
We can shoot
the Hong Kong, China vibe now!

154
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,990
Hong Kong, China!

155
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,510
Hong Kong, China!

00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,360
(Yanjiao's Fallen Angel)
Scene One, Take One.

157
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,310
Three, two, one. Action!

158
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,510
Track, go.

159
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,260
Push.

160
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,260
Ze,

161
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,580
I drank too much.

162
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,310
Come upstairs with me.

163
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,780
Cut.

164
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,580
What's wrong?

165
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,510
What's wrong?

166
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,020
Something is not right.

167
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,510
- What's not right?
- What is it?

168
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:50,960
What is it?

169
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,190
Shouldn't we...

170
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,580
I think we need
a production launch ceremony.

171
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,630
You want
a production launch ceremony now?

172
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,080
A short film doesn't need a ceremony.

173
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,900
Guys, wait a minute!

174
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,240
I think

175
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,460
a short film should have
a production launch ceremony too.

176
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,190
We need a sense of ceremony, right?

177
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,380
Then let's do it.

178
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,140
What do we need?

179
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,700
First, we need a red cloth

180
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,780
to cover the camera.

181
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,700
Red cloth?

182
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,260
I think there's a red skirt

183
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,070
in that bag of clothes. Can we use that?

184
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:15,990
- Sure.
- Yes, we can.

185
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,670
We'll use that.

186
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,900
Next, we need a banner

187
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,340
with the film's title.

188
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:19,640
Banner?

189
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,760
Oh, this tablecloth.
We can borrow this from the owner.

190
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,040
We can use it as a banner, right?

191
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,400
- That will work.
- This won't work.

192
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,190
It may be checkered.

193
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,400
But it's still a banner, right?

194
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,670
How do we write on it?

195
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,280
That's easy.

196
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,900
Just use some sticky tape,
and it's done.

197
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,140
You're so smart.

198
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,030
Baby, you're so smart.

199
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,700

200
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,550
you look so strong.

201
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,950
I'll give each of you

202
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,270

No, to the left.

Who let you in here?
Why did you touch the computer?

239
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,030
I didn't touch it.

What are you doing?

250
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,030
- Let him go.
- See what he did to your screen.

251
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,480
Let me make the introduction.

252

Mr. Zhang?

Boss, I'm so sorry.

257
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,390
is very vigilant. Very good.

She is, isn't she?

259
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,840
She has trained before, right?

260
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,820
She has the right moves.

261
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,790
It's to keep you in check.

262
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,190
She did, didn't she? How did it feel?

263
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,980
You're so childish.

264
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,500
You deserved to be restrained earlier.

265

Aren't you bored of this yet?

266
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,100
This one's really pretty average.

267
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,030
It's not as good as the previous one.

268
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,000

269
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,310
- Okay.
- I want the previous one.

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,840
- I'm changing it.
- You can't even spare

284
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,220
one day for me?

285
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,740
You're being slick right now.

286
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,500
I don't even know
how to respond to that.

287
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,340
Ms. Dai, this is the one you want,
right?

288
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,440
No, not this one. I'll change it myself.

289
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:32,560
Dai,

290
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,360

you looked this innocent before.

Which film is this?

293
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,390
It was in 2010.

294
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,270
We filmed a short film.

295
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,950
It was my
very first production launch ceremony.

296
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,820
I think I've seen these people before.

297
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,950
Of course.

298
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,820
Who is this guy?

299
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,340
Who's this?

300
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,550
He's so close to you.

301
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,700
My co-worker.

302
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,270
Your co-worker stood so close to you.

303
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,620
I said he's just a co-worker.

304
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,270
I want both of you to leave now.

305
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,240
Which co-worker is this?

306
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,150
I said, leave.

307
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,340
Move it, everyone.

308
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,430
- Do you want me to see you off?
- Okay, I'm leaving.

309
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,760
You watched the video, right?

312
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,820
She must be dating Mr. Zhang now.

313
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,500
I don't think so.

314
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,220
Mr. Zhang's totally one-sided.

315
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,070
I've got experience with this.

316
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,700
All right!

317
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,550
This way, everyone. Move quickly!

318
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,910
But I've got a bolder theory.

319
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,430
You said that photo

320
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,700
was from the 2010 shoot.

321
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,220
So at the end of 2009,

322
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,340
they hadn't broken up yet.

323
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,620
So you're saying...

324
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,910
There are still feelings
between her and Zhou Shui.

325
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,270
I'd rather believe she chose money.

326
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,580
How about this?

327
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,030
Send me all her social media handles.

328
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,460

My Goddess,

332
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,620
what are you doing?

333
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,550
Why are you calling me at this hour?

334
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,740
Are you out of money, out of work,

335
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,670
or got dumped?

336
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,100
No, no, none of that.

337
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,910
I only wanted to share some good news.

338
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,550
Today, our Director Zhou Shui

339
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,030
will start filming his first film
in Beijing.

340
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,360
Then that calls for a congratulations.

341
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,390
Then what do you do there?

342
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,700
I'm the producer.

343
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,860
Producer? What does a producer do?

344
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,960
A producer helps him make
the film happen.

345
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
After all that hard work,

346
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,740
you went to Beijing
to help him make a movie.

347
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,070
Why aren't you making your own?

348
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,190
What are you talking about?

349
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,740
How could I possibly make a movie?

350
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,430
Can I even do that?

351
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,270
Why not? When you were three,
I took you to get your fortune read.

353
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,460
you're not ordinary

354
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,980
and destined for something great.

355
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,150
From then on,

356
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,270
I've been worrying
about you every single day.

357
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,740
You're being silly.
What are you worried about?

358
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,310
Worried you'd fly away from me one day.

359
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,390
But now,

360
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,700
I've come to terms with it.

361
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,430
If you're going to fly, then fly.

362
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,340
As long as you're safe,

363
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,270
I'll support you wherever you go.

364
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,220
Enough talking.
You should get back to work.

365
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,460
I'm hanging up now.

366
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,150
Mom,

367
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,820
I think

368
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,500
I started going against you all the time

369
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,310
since I was at the university.

370
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,580
I don't want to do that anymore.

371
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,910
Can we make up?

372
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,980
You silly girl.

373
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,740
What are you saying?

374
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:53,550
When...

375
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,340
When have you ever needed
to say something like that to me?

376
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,950
We're mother and daughter.

377
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,580
We're tied together for life,
don't you know that?

378
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,100
Don't worry about me.

379
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,340
I'm doing great.

380
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,700
I'm feeding the fish right now.

381
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,760
Just to tell you.

382
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,430
These fish are much more obedient than you.

383
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,100
They eat whatever I feed them.

384
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,270
Just take care of yourself out there.
Do you hear me?

385
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,400
All right, I'm hanging up now.

386
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,550
Three, two, one. Action!

387
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,550
Go!

388
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,960
That concludes the showcase

389
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,160
(Shendu Pictures Creative Ideas)
of all today's projects.

390
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,240
Big thanks to all departments

391
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,800
- for the amazing teamwork.
- Come here.

392
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,340
Quick meeting.

393
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,430
I believe at this moment...

394
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,030
Do you think

395
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,860
Ms. Zhou liked our short film?

396
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,590
Of course.

397
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,350
I saw her laugh just now.

398
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,350
Did she?

399
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,220
And now,

400
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,830
the winner
of the Shendu Pictures Creative Ideas.

401
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,080
Let's look at the screen!

402
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,600
(Shendu Pictures Creative Ideas.
Winner)

403
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,400
("Yanjiao's Fallen Angel"
Web Drama Department)

404
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,200
It's "Yanjiao's Fallen Angel"
from the Web Drama Department!

405
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,950
Let's give a big round of applause

406
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,430
and welcome the creative leader
of this project,

407
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,260
Zhou Shui from Web Drama, to the stage!

408
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,700
- Go now.
- They're calling you.

409
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,540
Get up there!

410
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,350
Looking good!

411
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,260
Let's hear a few words from Zhou Shui.

412
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,500
This short film winning first place

413
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,740
is definitely not only my own effort.

414
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,910
I want to thank

415
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,110
everyone in the Web Drama Department.

416
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,430
Come up here
and share this moment with me!

417
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:02,870
Xue Cheng and Xiaomao!

418
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:07,390
They've been working with me in Beijing.

419
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,190
We share the same dream of making films.

420
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,500
This is our editor, Xiaomao.

421
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,540
And our cinematographer, Xue Cheng.

422
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,190
And of course, I want to thank Ze.

423
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,590
We met by chance
in the sea of people in Beijing.

424
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,590
And somehow,
fate brought us back together here

425
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,430
at Shendu.

426
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,190
Your script really was great.

427
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,020
It's all thanks to you
that you guys won.

428
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:35,740
Ze.

429
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,220
I'm coming!

430
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:38,980
Lastly,

431
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,220
I want to thank

432
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,980
the most important person.

433
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,400
We're out of time.

434
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,800
I'll say it for you.
The most important person is, of course,

435
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,020
Ms. Zhou, who supported
and encouraged all of you.

436
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,680
- We still have one more person to...
- Let's hear it for Ms. Zhou!

437
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,430
And welcome her to present the award
to the Web Drama Department!

438
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,190
Welcome!

439
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,870
Ms. Zhou, please stay

440
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,430
for a group photo
with the whole Web Drama team.

441
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,680
Come on in.

442
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:21,980
Okay, thank you.

443
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,500
Thank you, Ms. Zhou.

444
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,540
And congratulations to everyone
in the Web Drama Department.

445
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,390
Thank you, everyone.

446
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,260
What do you think?

447
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,630
Is this thing...

448
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,740
Hurry, pass it to me.

449
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,540
Let me see!

450
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,220
See this.

451
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,780
- Come on, I haven't seen it.
- Winner.

452
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,220
I wanted this so badly.

453
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,870
I didn't even catch it earlier.

454
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,060
It's so...

455
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:55,950
The feeling of winning is amazing!

456
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,060
Cheers!

457
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:58,430
Cheers!

458
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,430
We finally get to make the movies
we want to make!

459
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,150
Cheers!

460
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,390
The five of us

461
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,350
must be the youngsters
who give everything we've got,

462
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:09,980
okay?

463
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,590
Here!

464
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,700
To give our all.

465
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,150
To stay young at heart.

466
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,670
Forever young!

467
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,980
But I have to say,

468
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,540
after finishing this project,

469
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,150
even if things don't work out,

470
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,840
I could leave Beijing with no regrets!

471
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,670
What are you saying?

472
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:25,880
Wait.

473
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,780
- What are you talking about?
- How is it related to leaving Beijing?

474
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,020
You're not going anywhere.
We're all staying in Beijing.

475
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,460
That's right.

476
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,220
We're going to make the best films.

477
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,020
But if we do leave

478
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,830
Beijing one day,

479
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,980
what do you think the reason would be?

480
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,390
Do we have to leave?

481
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,670
Anyway, my dream

482
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,590
is to make the funniest comedies
in China.

483
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,300
If one day I stop being funny,

484
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,740
I'll quit and stop writing.

485
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,350
As for me,

486
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,910
I want to be

487
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:07,350
the best photographer in China.

488
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,300
Unless I lose an arm

489
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,670
one day.

490
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,670
- Lose an arm?
- Would that even happen?

491
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,430
And I'm gonna be the greatest editor.

492
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,910
Every top film in China

493
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,430
will be edited by me.

494
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,670
And

495
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,500
if I ever stop editing,

496
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,300
it would mean I'm dead.

497
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,120
Hey, take that back.

498
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,830
Take that back now.

499
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,720
Okay, I'll take that back.

500
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,110
Let's just forget I said that, yeah?

501
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,740
As for me,

502
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,700
you all know

503
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:44,350
I want to be the best film director
in China.

504
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,190
I want to make movies.

505
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,740
Unless one day

506
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,220
I become disabled

507
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:52,670
or go blind.

508
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,870
You'll stop filming if you go blind?

509
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,720
Even if I go blind, I'll keep filming.
Either way, I'm staying in Beijing.

510
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,870
I want to make movies.

511
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,390
That's right!

512
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:01,830
Well said!

513
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:02,400
Nice!

514
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,360
We'll shoot it together.

515
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,630
We'll make movies together.

516
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,630
We'll make movies.

517
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:08,150
- Then if I...
- You?

518
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,540
Wherever Shui is,
that's where you'll be,

519
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,780
following in his footsteps.

520
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,870
No, I'm not.

521
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,260
I have my own dream too, okay?

522
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:21,190
Yeah, your dream is to marry Shui,

523
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:21,480
right?

524
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,670
- No, it's not.
- I want to be honest about something.

525
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,150
What is it?

526
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,190
At first, I didn't think

527
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,630
you two were a good match.

528
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,540
But now,

529
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,630
you're made for each other!

530
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:31,740
Wait, I have a dream too!

531
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,630
As long as we don't give up
on our dreams,

532
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,020
we'll always be together!

533
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,800
We'll always be together.

534
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,870
We'll always be together!

535
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:39,960
We want to be together too.

536
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,590
- The five of us together.
- A toast!

537
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,630
Cheers!

538
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,590
Make great films

539
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,390
together.

540
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,110
Cheers!

541
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:47,830
Listen.

542
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,110
I want to shoot great dark humor.

543
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:50,590
Okay.

544
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,500
Oh, Quentin Tarantino style?

545
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,110
Exactly! Like him!

546
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,060
Okay, guys.

547
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,220
Let's listen to our director.

548
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,190
We'll film whatever the director says.

549
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,870
Why does everyone think

550
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,910
my dream is to marry him?

551
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,220
I have a dream too!

552
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,110
My dream is...

553
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:10,910
Oh...

554
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,870
What is my dream again?

555
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,350
I...

556
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,150
I came back to Beijing.

557
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,910
What is it that I actually want

558
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,260
aside from helping him make movies?

559
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,430
We'll just do
what the director says, okay?

560
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,220
Okay.

561
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,500
Did you laugh?

562
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,320
Raise your hand
if you thought it was funny.

563
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,700
I think it could be risky

564
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,020
to film such a concept.

565
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,500
What do you guys think?

566
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,720
I think the flaws don't outweigh
the charm.

567
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:40,110
This kind of absurd style
has that Stephen Chow flavor.

568
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,150
I agree.

569
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,870
So, are you saying you're Stephen Chow?

570
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,060
We don't want to be Stephen Chow.

571
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,390
We want our own style

572
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,500
that surpasses him.

573
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:51,780
Yes, surpass him.

574
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,590
Surpass him!

575
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:57,300
Sounds more like plagiarism
than surpassing to me.

576
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,670
We didn't copy anything.

577
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,590
Every single shot
was our own original work.

578
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,020
Just a quick reminder.

579
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,260
This short film

580
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,350
did win first prize in Creative Ideas.

581
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,390
It was voted on

582
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,150
by the whole company's young staff.

583
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,910
If that doesn't say something,

584
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,350
what does?

585
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,460
Ms. Zhou,

586
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,540
I work with young people all the time.

587
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,700
So I understand how they think.

588
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,700
Mind if I share a fair opinion?

589
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:21,670
Go ahead.

590
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,190
Young people today

591
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,060
often have this mindset.

592
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,460
They want quick success,

593
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,540
desperate to stand out,

594
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,150
and want to be seen.

595
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,020
And to do that,
they'll go out of their way

596
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,190
to be weird and over the top.

597
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,260
That's the mentality
this short film caters to.

598
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,110
So of course, the young folks love it.

599
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,020
But just because it's popular,
it doesn't mean it's good.

600
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,200
As a major player in the industry,

601
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,260
Shendu Pictures

602
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,460
should guide

603
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,190
young people

604
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,700
toward the right values,

605
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:57,020
but not encourage them to chase clout.

606
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,740
Wow. That's your fair opinion, huh?

607
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,720
Sure sounds like you're making
a big deal out of nothing.

608
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,280
I merely share my thoughts,

609
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,400
and you're saying
I'm making a big deal out of nothing?

610
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,220
Who's really turning this
into a big deal here?

611
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,260
I get it now.

612
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,740
You are just going back
on your word, right?

613
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,350
Xue Cheng, sit down.

614
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,460
Xue Cheng.

615
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,740
You promised to hire us full-time
after three months.

616
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,260
But you didn't.

617
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,500
Now, you're not making this into a film
like you promised.

618
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,360
Since you can't keep any of your words,

619
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,700
I quit!

620
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:36,700
Xue Cheng!

621
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,460
- Xue Cheng.
- Xue Cheng. Xue Cheng.

622
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,670
These young people nowadays

623
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,060
have the worst attitude.

624
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,740
All right, that's it for today.

625
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,670
Meeting adjourned.

626
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,240
Losing his temper
because someone said a few words.

627
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,590
Zhaoyang, is this
how you train your subordinates?

628
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,830
Give the ID badge back to Xue Cheng.

629
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,780
Is it over for us?

630
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:17,190
Was my script really not funny?

631
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,630
It's okay.

632
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,780
They just haven't come around to it yet.

633
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,950
Yesterday, someone from HR said

634
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,800
the management is shutting down
the Web Drama Department.

635
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,560
They're not planning
to invest in it anymore.

636
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,190
Are you serious?

637
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,160
Then where are we even supposed to go?

638
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,880
I think they are transferring us
to other departments

639
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,500
and starting our internship
all over again.

640
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,870
We have to start over.

641
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:52,630
What?

642
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,980
Continue with the internship?

643
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,630
It's no big deal.

644
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,950
I've already quit anyway.

645
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,780
Tell me the truth. Is the script

646
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,110
I wrote not funny?

647
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,350
Come on, I told you

648
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,460
they just don't get it.

649
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,540
Forget about all that annoying stuff.

650
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,670
Let's drink.

651
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,020
Today's agenda

652
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,260
is Xue Cheng's farewell party.

653
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,910
Sounds good? Everyone, cheer up!

654
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,390
- Cheer up a bit!
- Let's drink up.

655
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,040
- Enjoy yourself.
- Come on, smile.

656
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:25,500
Xue Cheng.

657
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,830
What's your plan

658
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,220
once you're back home?

659
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:33,670
Anything's fine, really.

660
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,700
I mainly just want

661
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,300
to spend time with my parents.

662
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,430
I've been in Beijing for so many years

663
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,150
and barely taken care of them.

664
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:44,020
When I look back,

665
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,870
they've really suffered a lot
because of me,

666
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,150
especially my dad.

667
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,740
But it's all good now.

668
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,260
Once I'm back home,

669
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,350
that's my turf.

670
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,350
Nobody can mess with him anymore.

671
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,870
- That's right!
- Your turf!

672
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:01,670
That is for sure.

673
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,910
Then remember to visit us

674
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,590
when you have the time.

675
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,870
I don't want to come back
to Beijing anymore.

676
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,150
You have to.

677
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,870
I've said this so many times.

678
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,700
When I shoot my first feature film,

679
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,020
you'll be my director of photography.

680
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:22,590
I...

681
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,430
I'm just a hobbyist,

682
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,430
not even a real cinematographer.

683
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,670
Come on.
Who here is actually a professional?

684
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,910
Aren't we all amateurs?

685
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:30,780
He's right.

686
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,910
You'll be our cinematographer. No buts.

687
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,220
Our first feature,

688
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:35,950
Ze,

689
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,700
you'll write it, okay?

690
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,280
Xiaomao will be the editor.

691
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,500
My producer will be Daji.

692
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,150
We're all here.

693
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,670
Come on, guys.

694
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,500
We've all won first place before.

695
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,350
Can you pull it together?
Get it together, guys!

696
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:50,780
He's right.

697
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,060
We're here to make movies, aren't we?

698
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,670
That's right!

699
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:54,560
Let's keep going!

700
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,160
- We'll definitely make a movie.
- Come on.

701
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,120
Come on, we've got this!

702
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,720
Xiaomao, drink.

703
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,250
Let's do this!

704
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,440
- Keep it going!
- Hang in there!

705
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,020
Okay, Xiaomao?

706
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,700
Um... I want to say something.

707
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,260
I'm pulling out too.

708
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,350
What?

709
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:07,740
You...

710
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,060
Where are you going?

711
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,740
What are you saying?

712
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,150
Come on, you guys all know

713
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,740
that my family is rich.

714
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,020
If this career doesn't work out,

715
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,460
I can always go back
and inherit our family's dental clinic.

716
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,150
I've got tons of money waiting for me.

717
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,670
But mainly, I'm heading back
to marry Yan Yan.

718
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,190
But didn't she say...

719
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,390
She'd wait a few more years?

720
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,460
Why are you suddenly...

721
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,830
Wait a few years?

722
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,060
How many more years?

723
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,830
Look at the mess I'm in right now.

724
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,480
Even if she waited a lifetime,
it wouldn't be enough.

725
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:57,830
Forget it.

726
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,630
The point is, you all know

727
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,020
Yan Yan has been so good to me.

728
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,060
I can't let her down.

729
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,390
So I guess I'll have to let you down.

730
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,830
You didn't let us down.

731
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,740
You're doing what's right.

732
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,260
When in love,

733
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,220
loyalty matters most.

734
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,400
She stuck with you.
So you have to stick with her.

735
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:18,500
Exactly.

736
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:20,110
So

737
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,150
I won't be making films
with you guys anymore.

738
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,780
It's okay, Xiaomao.

739
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,780
We still have him, right?

740
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,950
Our screenwriter, Ze.

741
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,870
Our producer, Daji.

742
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,160
The director is also still here.

743
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,400
- The three of us
- That's right.

744
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:38,110
can still film a movie, right?

745
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,430
So what if the department is shut down?

746
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,430
We're still working at the same company.

747
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,220
Right, Ze?

748
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,980
So what if they don't confirm us
as regular?

749
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,000
As long as we can make movies,

750
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,560
who cares about being
a regular employee?

751
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,300
Exactly, who cares?

752
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,920
Ze, let's have a drink, the three of us.

753
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,460
Come on.

754
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,080
I've been confirmed as a regular.

755
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,280
You're a regular employee now?

756
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:00,590
You...

757
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,920
You're a regular employee now?

758
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,300
How did you manage?

759
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,110
Congratulations, Ze.

760
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:08,670
Wait, you're a regular employee.
Why are we not confirmed?

761
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,300
That's right.

762
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,950
Say something.

763
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:17,390
Huang, did you know about this?

764
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,390
How did he pull it off?

765
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,670
We already broke up.

766
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:24,950
What?

767
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,040
When did that happen?

768
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,430
Yes, when?

769
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,920
You two looked fine last time on set.

770
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,120
Why did you suddenly break up?

771
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,060
Just happened
in the last couple of days.

772
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,830
I didn't want to come today.

773
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,300
But Ze said

774
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,190
it's better

775
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,350
if we told you guys.

776
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,220
Why?

777
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,590
Why did you break up?

778
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,190
It's me. It's my fault.

779
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,640
He has been staying
in Beijing all this time

780
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,830
and still not accomplished.

781
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,260
I only want a better life.

782
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,020
No, it's not her. It's me.

783
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:56,630
I got with Su Dan.

784
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:03,220
She said she could get me confirmed.

785
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,670
So I chose to get confirmed.

786
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:05,780
Daji.

787
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,780
Lin Ze!

788
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,590
Do you have a conscience?

789
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,540
Do you? Answer me!

790
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,360
That's enough, Daji.

791
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,830
What gives you the right?

792
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:25,540
That's enough!

793
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,780
Don't stop me!

794
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:32,540
Let him go.

795
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,430
Don't stop me! Beat him to his senses!

796
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,300
Ze is supposed to be our friend!

797
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,110
I'm not your friend!

798
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:41,190
You're the guy
who carries 2,000 yuan in his wallet!

799
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:41,980
What's your problem?

800
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,110
I was trying to defend you!

801
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:43,950
Shut up!

802
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:47,150
Your girlfriend says
she'll wait a few more years for you.

803
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,740
Living expenses of you two
for two weeks

804
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,320
already reached
tens of thousands of yuan.

805
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,220
If things don't work out,

806
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,780
you can go home
and inherit your family business.

807
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:57,780
What about me?

808
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:01,830
If things fall apart,
all I can do is drag her down with me!

809
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:06,350
I'm 33 years old this year.

810
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:13,140
But I still can't give her anything.

811
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,310
I had no other choice!

812
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:18,950
Yeah, I have no conscience.
Maybe I am a piece of garbage.

813
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,350
But what else was I supposed to do?

814
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,400
I really couldn't wait anymore.

815
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,310
Do you understand that?

816
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:25,880
Xue Cheng.

817
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,960
What are you doing, Xue Cheng?
What are you doing?

818
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,240
- Say that again.
- Xue Cheng.

819
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,540
- Xue Cheng!
- Stop it, Xue Cheng!

820
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,390
- Daji!
- What are you doing, Xue Cheng?

821
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,580
You want to fight?

822
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:34,660
Daji!

823
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,660
We haven't finished filming yet.

824
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,910
The Shendu Five,

825
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,460
not one less!

826
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,480
Let the five of us

827
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,320
always be the youngsters

828
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,760
who give it everything we've got, okay?

829
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,080
Come on!

830
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,710
To give our all.

831
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,060
To stay young at heart.

832
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,980
Forever young!

833
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,980
Are you guys done messing around?

834
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,140
What's wrong with you guys?

835
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,500
Why are we here today?

836
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,910
Are we here to fight?

837
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,540
Weren't we here to have some drinks?

838
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,350
Weren't we here to send off Xue Cheng?

839
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,350
You're all acting like lunatics!

840
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:10,910
Here!

841
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:12,580
Take one each!

842
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:14,430
Here!

843
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:21,270
Come on!

844
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,710
Let's just enjoy tonight!

845
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,620
No one leaves!

846
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:34,980
Drink!

847
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,270
Come on.

848
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,460
Drink!

849
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,230
I just remembered

850
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,980
I have work tomorrow.

851
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:01,660
I have to leave now.

852
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,620
You guys have fun.

853
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,180
Huang...

854
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:04,620
Bye!

855
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,750
I'll get going now.

856
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:06,460
Huang.

857
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,660
What's with the attitude, Lin Ze?

858
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,100
I'm warning you!

859
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:29,230
If you get in her car tonight,

860
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,710
we're done.

861
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,430
You will no longer be our friend!

862
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,350
Ze, let's go.

863
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,180
Xiaomao.

864
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,390
Xue Cheng. Daji.

865
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:22,980
Let's drink.

866
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:24,870
Let's drink.

867
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:29,430
Xiaomao.

868
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,430
I have to go.

869
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,460
I have a flight
to catch tomorrow morning.

870
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:36,620
Xiaomao...

871
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,620
Take care.

872
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:40,460
Take care.

873
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,180
Xiaomao...

874
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,980
Have another drink, Xiaomao!

875
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:11,680
Are you done fighting?

876
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,390
Who's paying?

877
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,390
I'll pay.

878
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,310
I only have 100 yuan.

879
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,460
Sorry about that.

880
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,870
Send my regards to your father.

881
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:56,950
Xue Cheng.

882
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,710
If you ever have time,

883
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:12,230
come visit us.

884
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:38,710
In the brightest days
of summer this year,

885
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,500
the five of us made a promise

886
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,750
to always give our all

887
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,660
and stay young at heart for each other.

888
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,580
But after that night,

889
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,660
everyone went their separate ways.

890
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,830
We never gathered again.

891
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,160
(Grand Opening of Yayi Dental Hospital)
Congratulations, Mr. Li!

892
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,350
Wish you a prosperous opening!

893
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:07,300
(Bengbu, Anhui, 2025)
(Xiaomao took over the family business,)

894
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:08,840
(married a rich and beautiful woman,)

895
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,230
(and officially peaked in life.)

896
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,140
Don't break it!

897
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:13,140
(Beijing, 2025)
Where did you get all these?

898
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,910
How could you drag your brother along?

899
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,180
Clean the house.

900
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,950
(Ze and Su Dan got married
and had children.)

901
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,760
(Su Dan felt one of them had)

902
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,460
(to give up their career
to raise the kid.)

903
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:27,180
(Obviously, Ze's career was easier
to give up.)

904
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,910
(Huang became a famous livestreamer.)

905
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,430
(The two of them
never crossed paths again.)

906
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:43,340
(Africa, 2025)

907
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,870
(Xue Cheng kept chasing his dream)

908
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,580
(and became
a National Geographic photographer.)

909
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,910
(With both fame and fortune,)

910
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:04,830
(he finally kept his promise
to his dad)

911
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,950
(and let him live out his days
in comfort and happiness.)

912
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,270
And just like that,

913
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:17,750
we drifted apart from our crew.

914
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:24,350
There are just the two of us
