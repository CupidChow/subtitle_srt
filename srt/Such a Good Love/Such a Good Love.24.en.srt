Then, we went our separate ways.

4
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,230
(Autumn 2024, Chongqing)
We'd been together for ten years.

5
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,350
I haven't seen her since.

6
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,350
I came today

7
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,380
to give this back to you.

8
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,070
It's all your story.

9
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,190
I guess I'm returning it
to its rightful owner.

10
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,380
Shui.

11
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,230
Everyone in the videos calling you that.

12
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,030
Goodbye.

13
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,510
Daji.

14
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,260
I'm done with all your story.

15
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,790
Please accept my resignation.

- Let's go!

36
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:44,870
Daji.

37
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,140
It's been a while, Mr. Lin.

38
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,020
It has.

39
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,550
I want to make Such A Good Love

40
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,340
into a film.

41
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,820
Directed by me.

42
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,110
I heard you and Zhou Shui

43
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,950
were shooting a film for Ruidi.

44
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,460
Why are you back on your own?

45
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,870
I told you before...

46
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,750
It's fine.

47
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,670
We broke up.

48
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,460
I'm not working on that film anymore.

49
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,900
That's a shame.

50
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,220
Let's get back to Such A Good Love then.

51
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,140
I'll be upfront.

52
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,820
I've pitched it to a bunch

53
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,460
of companies the past two months.

54
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,380
No luck.

55
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,380
Shendu is my last shot.

56
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,460
So just give it to me straight.

57
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,190
Yes or no.

58
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,820
Don't worry. We'll give this film

59
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,460
our full support.

60
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,020
Su.

61
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,550
I read the script

62
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,870
a long time ago.

63
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,780
And honestly,

64
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,380
it's one of the best I've ever seen.

65
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,700
Daji.

66
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,630
Your script is more
on the artistic side.

67
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,260
There's no big hook.

68
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,870
Did you even read the script carefully?

69
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,430
It's realistic.

70
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,920
But it won't be popular.
No way to bring in A-list talent.

71
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:55,700
And

72
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,510
the story's set ten years ago, right?

73
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,990
That's dated.

74
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,260
Nostalgia is trendy right now though.

75
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,110
Look at Eternal Moment, Fleet of Time,

76
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,870
I Belonged to You.

77
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,110
All...

78
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,310
What I want for Shendu isn't nostalgia.

79
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,020
I want now, urban, fresh.

80
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,070
Anyway,

81
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,260
go revise the script.

82
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,380
She's the director.

83
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,020
Daji, it's okay.

84
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,220
I'll help you rewrite it.

85
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,020
- You...
- Right now...

86
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,630
Sorry.

87
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,460
I'm not changing
a single word of this script.

88
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,220
And I want full control over the edit.

89
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,430
With all these demands,
it's not going to work.

90
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,780
If you want to direct,
you need to learn to compromise.

91
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,700
I'm not doing this just to direct.

92
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,030
I want this movie to be made.

93
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,790
And I want to make it
without compromise.

94
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,550
If you won't compromise,
you won't get investment.

95
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,820
And without money,
how are you going to shoot it?

96
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,820
Then I'll fund it myself.

97
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,390
Surely you know

98
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,030
how expensive making a movie is.

99
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,030
It's not pocket change.

100
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,310
I know.

101
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,910
If I can't afford a feature,

102
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,190
I'll make a short.

103
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,620
But Such A Good Love
has to be done my way.

104
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,580
Well, best of luck then.

105
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,550
Daji! Wait!

106
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,460
Anything else, Mr. Lin?

107
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,820
What happened between you and Zhou Shui?

108
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,700
What do you mean?

109
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,150
We broke up.

110
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,460
Haven't you ever broken up before?

111
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,220
He's been

112
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,070
going crazy looking for you.

113
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,790
He's not doing well at all.

114
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,190
Once,

115
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,150
he called me at 5 AM

116
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,580
asking where you were.

117
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,620
He's asked me,
asked Xue Cheng, asked Xiaomao.

118
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,950
He's looking for you every day.

119
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,670
Did you tell him
I was coming here today?

120
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,430
Didn't you ask me not to?

121
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,670
But I really think

122
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,700
you should tell him about the movie.

123
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,580
He could help you.

124
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:54,910
I don't want his help.

125
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,150
I can

126
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,190
make a movie on my own.

127
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,310
(Forbes China releases)

128
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,190

129
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,340
(of Most Influential Women in Business.)

130
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,070
(Dong Mingzhu takes the top spot.)

131
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:11,820
Sir.

132
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,460
So we're all set then.

133
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,620
Once we're inside,

134
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,310
please act like we're not even here.

135
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,460
No problem.

136
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,700
But be safe, alright?

137
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,620
We will.

138
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,270
This is for you. Please take it.

139
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,500
All right. Thanks.

140
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,740
Be careful with the equipment.

141
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,580
Take it easy.

142
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,190
Thank you.

143
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,430
Thanks.

144
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,220
Director Dai!

145
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,860
Heard you're making a film.

146
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,590
(Such A Good Love!)
Any part for me?

147
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,430
Ze?

148
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,460
Any parts for us?

149
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,340
Hope you didn't forget us.

150
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,700
Xiaomao.

151
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:01,740
Xue Cheng.

152
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,220
You guys...

153
00:11:03,327 --> 00:11:12,060

(Demolish)

156
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,860
They're tearing this place down.

157
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,190
Can we still film here?

158
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,620
We can. I checked.

159
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,100
The demolition will start in a week.

160
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,620
As long as we move fast,

161
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,500
we can finish in time.

162
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,740
Where is this place?

163
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,860
Why do we have to shoot here?

164
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,430
This place is called

165
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,580
Chunzhili Residence.

166
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,950
Chunzhili Residence.

167
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,860
Are we good to go?

168
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,620
Yes. Let's roll.

169
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,270
Okay.

170
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,500
Scene 28, shot 7, take 1.
Three, two, one.

171
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,460
Action!

172
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,100
Xue Cheng, tilt a little to the left.

173
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,190
Hey! Who are you people?

174
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,550
What are you doing?

175
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,430
- We're shooting a film.
- Sir...

176
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,030
Sorry, sir.

177
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,430
We're filming here.

178
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,390
Filming what?

179
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:58,980
Sir.

180
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,310
We're just making a film.

181
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,670
What film?

182
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,670
Don't you know
this place is getting demolished?

183
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,430
We do.

184
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,550
Pack up and get out.

185
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,150
Sir, you're in charge here, right?

186
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:13,790
Cigarette.

187
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:14,950
I'm sorry.

Very sorry for the delay.

189
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,620
We won't take long.

190
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,430
We'll wrap up quickly.
Won't hold you up.

191
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,190
Or maybe

192
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,950
I could pay a small location fee?

193
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,310
Have a cigarette.

194
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,950
Forget it!

195
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,430
Miss.

196
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,430
I'm in charge of the entire site.

197
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,430
You think I need your pocket change?

198
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,030
Clear them out.

199
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,190
Tear down all this junk.

200
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:43,950
On it, Mr. Zhang.

201
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,550
You guys, clean this place up.

202
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,860
Sir, we can wrap this up in no time!

203
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,950
Don't touch that!

204
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:49,430
Move it!

205
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,550
No, wait! Actors!

206
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,820
Get out of there! Move!

207
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,500
Xiaomao! Move!

208
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,700
Come here! Don't fight them!

209
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,580
Darn it.

210
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,670
I'll go talk to him.

211
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,430
What's there to talk about?

212
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,620
They're just a bunch of thugs.

213
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,500
Yes. Let's go

214
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,230
to somewhere else.

215
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,190
Agreed.

216
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,150
I'll help you find one.

217
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,550
No.

218
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,620
This film has to be shot here.

219
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,620
This way. Over here.

220
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,580
Mr. Zhang!

221
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,670
You're Mr. Zhang, right?

222
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,270
Can we talk for a minute?

223
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,910
Just give us time

224
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,270
to finish

225
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,950
the scene over there.

226
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,070
Just one day.

227
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,910
I promise we'll finish in a day.

228
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,270
Then you can tear it all down.

229
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,740
Not a chance.

230
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,620
Didn't you see we've already started?

231
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,980
The excavators are already here.

232
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,030
Then tear this side first.

233
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,100
Just give me that side.

234
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,390
I'll finish in one day,

235
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,340
then we'll leave.

236
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,620
We won't delay anything, okay?

237
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,620
Besides, your notice says demolition

238
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,950
starts next week.

239
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,550
It also said, "may start early."

240
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,670
Wait, Mr. Zhang...

241
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,580
I'm begging you.

242
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,550
This is really important.

243
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,070
I have to finish this shoot today.

244
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:49,770
One day. I swear.

245
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,150
Listen. Just leave now.

246
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,190
If you don't leave now,

247
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,500
I'll tear down this whole street
with you in it.

248
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,190
If you don't let me shoot today,

249
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,100
you are tearing nothing down!

250
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,550
Just ignore her.

251
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,950
All right. Rotate this way. Come on.

252
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,580
Don't tear it down! Stop!

253
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,550
Out of my way!

254
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,340
Come on! Dig into me then!

255
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,340
Go on, tear me down with it!

256
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,500
Then maybe...

257
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,460
Tear that side first.

258
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,430
Over there.

259
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,620
- Right here.
- Come on.

260
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,030
No! Not here either!

261
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,980
No one's tearing anything down!

262
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:43,580
Are you leaving or not?

263
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,340
Just give me one day!

264
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,150
You want me to smash your face?

265
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,820
Just one day!

266
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,860
Please...

267
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,270
Are you insane or something?

268
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,860
Just treat me like I'm crazy then.

269
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,220
Just let me film for one day.

270
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,620
- Take her away.
- Come on.

271
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,700
You...

272
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,460
Let me go!

273
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,100
I'll be standing right here!

274
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,610
Tear it down with me if you dare!

275
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,390
Fine.

276
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:31,740
Looks like

277
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,270
dust is everywhere at this site.

278
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,860
Bring the water truck over.
Spray it down.

279
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,740
You leaving now?

280
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:53,740
No!

281
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:57,980
Spray her.

282
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:06,740
Nice and cold!

283
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,020
You leaving now?

284
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,220
Still not leaving!

285
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:28,980
Ready to go now?

286
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,950
Not a chance!

287
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,980
Never!

288
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,020
She's as stubborn as a mule.

289
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,540
How about now?

290
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,350
I said I'm not leaving!

291
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,180
Crank up the water pressure.
Soak her hard.

292
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,780
(Back in 2007, in Haikou,)

293
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,540
(Zhou Shui told me
about the magic hour.)

294
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,910
(And today,)

295
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,220
(I witnessed my own magic hour.)

296
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,060
Scoot over. Make some room for me.

297
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,390
All this just for a film?

298
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,780
Is it really worth it to put yourself

299
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:12,740
through this?

300
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,670
I'm talking to you.

301
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,390
You think just by

302
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,870
throwing yourself into this,

303
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,460
you'll stop us?

304
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,590
Keep dreaming.

305
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,870
Then tell me,

306
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,870
what is worth fighting for?

307
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,190
If you ask me,

308
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,500
nothing is.

309
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,460
I used to brawl
just to win construction contracts.

310
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,350
Tore my tendons.

311
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,600
Ripped the ones in my leg too.

312
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,980
Broke two ribs.

313
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,390
Had three concussions.

314
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,500
Now I've lost 30%

315
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,350
of the hearing in this ear.

316
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,060
Every single time I thought,

317
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,670
if I could just get this job,

318
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,740
this money,

319
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,110
I'd finally make it.

320
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,590
I'd change my life.

321
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,670
And in the end?

322
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,950
Here I am.

323
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,430
Still just...

324
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,260
a thug.

325
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,390
But if the guy

326
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,980
sitting here today were the younger you,

327
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,980
bloody and desperate,

328
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,460
with nothing left to lose,

329
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,830
would you tell him to give up?

330
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,110
This street is coming down today

331
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,670
or tomorrow, and you can't stop it!

332
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,460
I said I only need one day!

333
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,870
And I keep my word!

334
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,870
I'll make it the day after tomorrow!

335
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,780
You didn't have to yell.

336
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,460
Pan over for a wide shot.

337
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,540
Just to capture the vibe.
We're short on time.

338
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,460
Sorry, everyone.

339
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,590
Can we all please move a little faster?

340
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,670
We only have this location for today.

341
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,220
Please. Let's pick up the pace.

342
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,870
Director gave the word. Didn't you hear?

343
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,430
- Okay.
- Hurry it up.

344
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,740
Move.

345
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,590
Thanks.

346
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:14,830
Right.

347
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,590
You're playing a character
named Old Chives.

348
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,350
You know that?

349
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,390
I know.

350
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:19,540
No, no.

351
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,700
Someone doing manual labor

352
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,980
wouldn't wear clothes

353
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,460
that neat.

354
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,430
This looks much better.

355
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,220
Okay. That's good.

356
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,540
Come with me.

357
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,220
You sit here.

358
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,390
You were supposed to have a grandson,

359
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,390
but we couldn't find one,

360
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,590
so now you've got a box here.

361
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,060
Okay.

362
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,700
All right.

363
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,190
Hurry.

364
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:39,950
Are we rolling yet?

365
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,630
Not yet.

366
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,060
We're ready, Director Dai.

367
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:42,980
Okay.

368
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,460
Xue Cheng, get started.

369
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,110
Let's do it.

370
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:45,670
Action!

371
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,700
Cheers!

372
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,430
Everyone's here today.

373
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,980
What's your dream?

374
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,220
What's your dream?

375
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,910
Serious answers only.

376
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:58,700
One by one.

377
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,780
Xue Cheng, go!

378
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,460
Come on!

379
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,300
Glasses!

380
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,590
My dream?

381
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:07,190
Why should we only get
to play pirated games?

382
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,700
Warcraft, Red Alert, CS...

383
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,910
Why are there no Chinese games?

384
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,700
Right!

385
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,190
We came to Beijing...

386
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,260
Good.

387
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,110
Xue Cheng, push in.

388
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,110
We came here

389
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,460
to make

390
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,670
a Chinese-made game!

391
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:22,590
Nice!

392
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,740
Old man, your turn.

393
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,190
My dream

394
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:27,830
- is...
- Cut!

395
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,630
Okay. Good.

396
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,260
Very good! Xue Cheng,

397
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,910
now cut to a close-up.

398
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,870
Follow that light.

399
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:33,880
Get that side first.

400
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,150
Great.

401
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,630
- I didn't finish my line.
- Let's do

402
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,630
a looser version later.

403
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:36,910
Hey.

404
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:37,870
A looser take.

405
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:38,410
A full shot

406
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,830
- of this area.
- Come here.

407
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,980
Come here!

408
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,780
What's wrong, Mr. Zhang?

409
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,020
Why did you "cut"

410
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,500
right when I start my line?

411
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,300
What's the deal?

412
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,910
You didn't finish your line, right?

413
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:51,460
Exactly.

414
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,540
Everyone else got to talk,

415
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,090
but when it was my turn, you cut me off!

416
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,590
You know how embarrassing that is?

417
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,190
I'm really sorry.

418
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,430
That was just a wide establishing shot.

419
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,500
The atmosphere matters.

420
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,830
We'll shoot your close-up.

421
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,020
It won't affect the scene.

422
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:03,830
No way.

423
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,950
It took me a long time
to come up with my lines.

424
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,910
I have to say it.

425
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:07,590
No, no.

426
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,500
You don't need to

427
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,110
be like that.

428
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,910
You just need to say, loud and clear,

429
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,700
"I'll be content to open
a shop in Beijing!"

430
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,190
Who wrote that line?

431
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,740
I've got my own dream.

432
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,630
Right. Then...

433
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,980
What is your dream?

434
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,150
My dream is

435
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,150
to meet

436
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,350
someone worth loving.

437
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,950
That's a great line.

438
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,700
I'll add that for you.

439
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,110
You can say it

440
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,780
right after

441
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,220
Vest finishes his part.

442
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,540
And we'll still need

443
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,260
to include the "shop in Beijing" line...

444
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,150
Dai Daji.

445
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,700
Do you know why I wanted to help you?

446
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,110
Why?

447
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,540
Not because I'm into your looks.

448
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,060
Right.

449
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,630
I just think you're respectful,

450
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,060
you know?

451
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,590
Oh no... Don't compliment me like that.

452
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,260
Don't flatter me.

453
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,060
I'm not an expert.

454
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,830
But I can tell

455
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,350
that you're not just shooting a film.

456
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,260
You're chasing a dream.

457
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:00,910
That's fair...

458
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,630
So I guess that's why I fell for you.

459
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:03,780
Hold up!

460
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,500
You can't say stuff like that.

461
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,740
We're just shooting a film here.

462
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,530
Don't be like that.

463
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,460
I'm not a cultured guy.

464
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,950
I say what I mean.

465
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,700
I'm Zhang Daqiang.

466
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,020
I own four companies,

467
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,740
ten properties, and five cars.

468
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,300
No wife, no kids.

469
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,540
Be my girlfriend?

470
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,870
No.

471
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,430
Why not?

472
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,910
I'm not handsome enough?

473
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,540
I...

474
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,300
I dressed like this just for you.

475
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,190
You know how stylish

476
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:33,980
I usually am.

477
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,670
I know. You're a fashion icon.

478
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,430
Here's the thing.

479
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,300
When two people walk the same path,

480
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,350
they have to compromise.

481
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,020
I've had enough of that life.

482
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,700
I want to try something new.

483
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,350
From now on,

484
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,830
I'm walking alone.

485
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,150
I want a path that's all mine.

486
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,390
Sorry.

487
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,020
Xue Cheng, ready.

488
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,830
Let's get another shot from this axis.

489
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:00,670
That was great.

490
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:01,670
You guys were amazing.

491
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:02,260
And...

492
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,980
That just made me fall harder for you.

493
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,830
Three, two, one!

494
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,150
Beijing welcomes us!

495
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:30,630
Beijing welcomes us!

496
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,110
I want to be China's bodybuilding champ!

497
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,630
I want to change my fate
through knowledge!

498
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,500
My dream is to become
China's greatest director!

499
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,110
Nice!

500
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,150
I want to be a rich woman!

501
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,060
I want to sponsor
China's greatest director!

502
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,950
All right. Cut!

503
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,910
Fantastic. That's a wrap!

504
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,260
Great job, everyone.

505
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:09,780
Good work.

506
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,780
Thanks everyone. Awesome!

507
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,830
Let's do it tomorrow.

508
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:12,780
Have a rest.

509
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,830
Let's head back.

510
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,020
Thanks, everyone.

511
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,260
Take a look.

512
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,110
Looks good.

513
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,350
Boys.

514
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:23,060
What...

515
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,300
- What...
- Spill it.

516
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,700
What's the director's zodiac sign,

517
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,700
blood type,

518
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,670
and what kind of guys does she like?

519
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,540
She's a Gemini.

520
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,830
She likes Aquarius guys.

521
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,670
Are you an Aquarius?

522
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,590
What sign are you?

523
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,670
Aquarius?

524
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,740
I'm a Scorpio.

525
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,020
That's kind of far from Aquarius.

526
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,110
Yes.

527
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,870
I'm not an Aquarius.

528
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:42,870
Forget it, man.

529
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,700
Let it go, man.

530
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,700
- You're not her type.
- You're not her type.

531
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,830
Mr. Zhang!

532
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,220
Thank you.

533
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,390
Thank you so much.

534
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,830
We've finished filming here.

535
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,830
You can do your work tomorrow.

536
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:58,830
Thank you

537
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,870
for all your help.

538
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,220
Until we meet again.

539
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,110
See you around.

540
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:02,950
Pack up!

541
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,430
Plenty more flowers
out there in the world.

542
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,910
Why chase just one?

543
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,540
Dai Daji.

544
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,150
Zhang?

545
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,500
We might not make a good couple.

546
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,590
How about business partners?

547
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,670
I believe in you.

548
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,950
Let's start a film company together.

549
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,390
What do you say?

550
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,190
Sure.

551
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,740
I'm in!

552
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,020
"Divorce Agreement" grossed two billion
at the box office!

553
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,390
(Spring 2025, Beijing)

554
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,780
- Daji, always lucky and blessed!
- Great!

555
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,218
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

556
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:07,581
Cheers!

557
00:28:07,581 --> 00:28:08,630
Yuan, great work.

558
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,150
Your performance was amazing.

559
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,590
From Such A Good Love with Daji to now,

560
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,260
our company's really come

561
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,260
a long way.

562
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,300
Come a long way?

563
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:19,910
Wait.

564
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,060
What's Such A Good Love?

565
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,220
That was the first film
Daji and I did together.

566
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,740
She put in 500,000 of her own money.

567
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,430
Her entire life savings.
Impressive, huh?

568
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,740
Who'd dare to start a shoot

569
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:31,260
before the investors pay up?

570
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,390
- Seriously.
- Right?

571
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,950
Actors won't even sign.

572
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,150
Isn't that right, Yuan?

573
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,630
You call, I'll be there.

574
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,060
For real?

575
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:37,700
For real.

576
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,460
So generous with me. Thank you.

577
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:41,260
Ms. Dai.

578
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,910
Thanks for crediting

579
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:45,150
an ex-employee

580
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,350
like me.

581
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,740
Everyone who contributed
deserves a name in the credits.

582
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,190
Thank you.

583
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,350
I've been reading

584
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,670
this popular web novel lately.

585
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,060
What's it name?

586
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,150
2025...

587
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,260
"We Actually Broke Up In 2025."

588
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,830
I read that.

589
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,700
You all read it too?

590
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,630
It's blowing up.

591
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,300
Had me crying my heart out.

592
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,150
Really?

593
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:06,780
It's that good?

594
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,020
Of course! Everyone's read it.

595
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:08,740
Here it is.

596
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,260
Read it.

597
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,860
(We Actually Broke Up In 2025)
Let's make this our next project.

598
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,980
Can I catch my breath first?

599
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,980
I just wrapped this one.

600
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,740
You're still young!

601
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,700
Make that money!

602
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,670
Can't I have a personal life?

603
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,670
Oh? What personal life?

604
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,060
Hey, now. Can't we have some privacy?

605
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,910
Stop making fun of me.

606
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,830
- All right?
- Let me read it first.

607
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:26,830
- Okay?
- OK.

608
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,230
- She'll read it first.
- Alright.

609
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,500
(We Actually Broke Up In 2025)

610
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,780
(Tong Leyi)

611
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,630
Hey, Tong Leyi.

612
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,740
Old story's over.

613
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,870
Want to hear a new one?

614
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:45,540
I'll send it to you.

615
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,350
Hotpot coming through!

616
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,190
Thanks.

617
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,010
Sorry for the wait.

618
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,670
Take your time. Enjoy.

619
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,950
Start with some ice jelly first.

620
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,020
Have you guys read that novel

621
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,210
that's all over the internet?

622
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,500
Oh, I know! Don't say it!

623
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,260
It's called

624
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,500
"We Actually Broke Up In 2025"!

625
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:10,870
That's the one.

626
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,220
You've all read it?

627
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,350
I stayed up all night finishing it.

628
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,780
Me too! Couldn't stop.

629
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,190
It's a really good story.

630
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,020
I read it too.

631
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,220
The author's name is Shibei.

632
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,870
Never heard of Shibei before.

633
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:22,950
Enjoy it. Take your time.

634
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:23,780
Okay.

635
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:24,150
Okay.

636
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,110
All right.

637
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,630
The story's good stuff.

638
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:27,980
- Shui.
- You're here.

639
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,780
- You came.
- Boss!

640
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,670
The bill is paid.

641
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,460
All right!

642
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,870
- Take care.
- Bye.

643
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,500
What can I get you?

644
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,540
I'm good.

645
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,910
I know you know

646
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,350
that novel they're talking about.

647
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:38,700
What novel?

648
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,700
We Actually Broke Up In 2025.

649
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,300
Don't bother pretending. I've read it.

650
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:44,060
It's clearly about you and Dai Daji.

651
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,220
You already know how it ends.

652
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,190
Why bother reading it?

653
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,500
Thing is,

654
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:49,950
I've got a friend

655
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,300
running a film company in Beijing.

656
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,430
She's interested
in turning this story into a movie.

657
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,110
Zihao.

658
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,500
I don't make much,

659
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,020
but I'm not short on money.

660
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,630
I don't need it.

661
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,460
It's not about the money.

662
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,870
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

663
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,540
You could use this

664
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,150
to make a comeback as a director.

665
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,190
Direct something that's really you.

666
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,110
I'm done making films.

667
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:14,500
Are you sure?

668
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,460
I am.

669
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,830
I just run a hotpot restaurant now.

670
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:19,670
I'm good with that.

671
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,390
Why stop making movies

672
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,150
and switch to hotpot?

673
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,780
The day the girl left

674
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,870
was the day the boy's youth ended.

675
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:36,980
(Winter 2017, Beijing)

676
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,300
From that day on,

677
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,830
the boy didn't know where he was headed.

678
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,300
And behind him,

679
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,300
there was no one left waiting.

680
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:47,670
So

681
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,300
that's why the movie is called

682
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,740
"The Day Youth Ends"?

683
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,110
Yes.

684
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,540
Was the story

685
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,150
based on

686
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,150
your own relationship?

687
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,060
Supposedly, your girlfriend

688
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,700
was listed as co-director.

689
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,060
But she was not.

690
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,060
How's your relationship now?

691
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,740
Did you break up?

692
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,320
What does that have to do with the film?

693
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,830
Well, you need a publicity hook.

694
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,230
Otherwise, who's going to watch it?

695
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,670
Sorry.

696
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,020
Director Zhou!

697
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:21,740
Director Zhou!

698
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:22,870
Director Zhou,

699
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:23,870
calm down.

700
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:24,910
They're press.

701
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,430
What do you expect?

702
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,020
You told them to ask that, didn't you?

703
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,260
I... You got it wrong.

704
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,540
Curious audiences

705
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,190
buy tickets.

706
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,670
And you're the director.

707
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:34,700
You need to learn to...

708
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,910
I've got a question for you.

709
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,980
Daji and I both worked on this film.

710
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,110
Why isn't her name on the poster?

711
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,950
She asked not to be credited.

712
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,350
I don't hold anything against her.

713
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:48,780
Fine.

714
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,950
Then add her name back.

715
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,350
Sure.

716
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,430
But during next week's
red carpet premiere,

717
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,590
you better show up together.

718
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,020
Walk that red carpet hand-in-hand.

719
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,830
Then we can justify
putting her name back on.

720
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:59,780
Right, director?

721
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,100
(To Daji. Call canceled.)
(Daji, are you there?)

722
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,780
(Call me back. Where are you?)

723
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,980
(Daji)

724
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:12,740
Sorry.

725
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,870
The subscriber you are trying
to reach is unavailable.

726
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,590
Please try again later.

727
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:24,620
(I have something to tell you.
Call me back when you see this.)

728
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:28,860
(Xiaoya)

729
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,350
Mrs. Dai?

730
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,110
I just want to ask
if Daji is with you...

731
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,670
She's not here.

732
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,670
I don't know where she is either.

733
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,923
(Can you come
to the movie premiere tomorrow?)

734
00:33:51,923 --> 00:33:53,860
(Wait you at the Film Archive
at 2 PM tomorrow.)

735
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,950
(The Day Youth Ends.)

736
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,300
All right. This way, please.

737
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,460
Mr. Zhang!

738
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,460
(The Day Youth Ends)

739
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,460
Welcome.

740
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,140
Welcome.

741
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:15,140
(Dai Daji)

742
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,541
(Dai Daji)

743
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,350
Stop looking. She's not coming.

744
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:38,980
Sorry.

745
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:44,694
Sorry. The subscriber you dialed
is power off.

746
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,740
(Leaves drift without a home,
yet fierce winds find their way back.)

747
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,480
(May life be filled with joy and peace.)

748
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:05,820
(A wonderful year,
and an even better one to come.)

749
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,910
(In Xiaoya's Moments post)

750
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,230
(on the last day of 2017,)

751
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,660
(I finally found her.)

752
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,540
(On that New Year's Eve ten years ago,)

753
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,310
(just before midnight,)

754
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,270
(I lit a sparkler for her)

755
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,180
(and sparked our love.)

756
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,790
(Today, before the clock
strikes midnight again,)

757
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:35,870
(I must find her)

758
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,790
(and light another for her,)

759
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,180
(for our love.)

760
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,180
(That night,)

761
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,460
(all plane and train tickets
were sold out.)

762
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,180
(I couldn't wait for morning.)

763
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,020
(I had to rush to her, no matter what.)

764
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,790
Let's review what you achieved

765
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:57,950
in 2024.

766
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,910
I shot

767
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,500
27 celebrities this year,

768
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,980
had 12 magazine covers,

769
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,980
and did campaigns for 10 brands.

770
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,950
Got it.

771
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,060
Congratulations!

772
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,540
You made a lot.

773
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,230
Your turn.

774
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,270
Leyi.

775
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,350
I don't bother with this.

776
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,910
You're all slaves to big data.

777
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,230
Your year-end review.

778
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,910
What did you get in 2024?

779
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,830
I landed a job

780
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:21,140
I'm happy with,

781
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:24,020
and I even got "Employee of the Year."

782
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,310
Also!

783
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,660
I got

784
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,950
my first Chanel bag!

785
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,710
I'm so happy!

786
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:35,660
Come on!

787
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:39,500
Happy New Year!

788
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,180
Who's it?

789
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,350
Tong Leyi.

790
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,950
Su Zihao.

791
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,230
Let me ask you something.

792
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:51,180
What did you gain in 2024?

793
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:53,750
Why are you always asking
these lame questions?

794
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,460
Just answer me.

795
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,390
Tell me.

796
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,790
What did you get in 2024?

797
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,500
Made a lot of money!

798
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,230
Bought a lot of clothes!

799
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,620
Took tons of photos!

800
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,460
I won

801
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,060
a bunch of medals,

802
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,750
won a bunch of games,

803
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,310
unlocked a ton of skins,

804
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,710
traveled to so many places.

805
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,230
But none of that matters, does it?

806
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,980
So what does matter?

807
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,270
What's worth remembering?

808
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,620
If we died tomorrow,

809
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,980
what would we think about

810
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,500
in our final moment?

811
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,580
I remember

812
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,100
I fell in love this year.

813
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,390
I fell in love

814
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,270
this year too.

815
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,540
Su Zihao,

816
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:41,540
Happy New Year.

817
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,620
Happy New Year,

818
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,620
Tong Leyi.

819
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,390
(The New Year's bell is about to ring.)

820
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,660
(Let's do a count down together.)

821
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,020
(Ten.)

822
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,140
(Nine.)

823
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:55,980
(Eight.)

824
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:56,830
(Seven.)

825
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:57,750
(Six.)

826
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,870
Five, four,

827
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,100
three, two, one.

828
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,140
Happy New Year!

829
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,180
Happy New Year!

830
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,310
Happy New Year!

831
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:17,910
Dai Daji!

832
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:35,270
Happy New Year!

833
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,180
1,367 kilometers to destination

834
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:42,460
Ezhou, Hubei Province.

835
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,270
(I knew)

836
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:19,870
(this was all)

837
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,390
(just a futile, performative gesture
for myself.)

838
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,830
(But maybe this was)

839
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,710
(my last bit)

840
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,710
(of stubbornness for youth,
and for Daji.)

841
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,350
Happy New Year, Dai Daji!

842
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,140
Happy New Year!

843
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,230
Happy New Year, Zhou Shui.

844
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:06,580
Happy New Year,

845
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:08,950
Daji.

846
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,710
Happy New Year!

847
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,020
Here.

848
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,580
Happy New Year!

849
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,830
Fireworks going off at 11 PM already?

850
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:41,980
That's early.

851
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,100
Looks pretty though.

852
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:44,790
Here.

853
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,660
My New Year gift for you.

854
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,750
Thank you, Mr. Zhou!

855
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:50,910
Do you like it?

856
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:53,350
What about me?

857
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,270
Where's my gift?

858
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:54,710
Right here.

859
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,310
I saw that.

860
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,230
- Here.
- Let me take a look.

861
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:01,660
Chinese mugwort.

862
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,010
You've got rheumatism, right?

863
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,790
Time to start
taking care of yourself, Juan.

864
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:07,180
You're right.
We're at the age where health matters.

865
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,410
I got you a back support belt.

866
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,020
With this thing on,

867
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:16,950
I could cook hotpot all day!

868
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:18,790
I like this.

869
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,080
I'll start wearing it tomorrow.

870
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:20,580
Here.

871
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,430
Cheers.

872
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,060
To a happy new year

873
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:23,950
and good health!

874
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:57,830
Are you crazy?!

875
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:58,790
You're filming now?

876
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,060
This is the perfect time!

877
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,060
It's so cinematic!

878
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,140
Hold Zhou Shui down!

879
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,230
I'm going to beat him up!

880
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,390
He's going to beat you up!

881
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,580
Why only me?

882
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:08,580
Because he said you like me!

883
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,620
I do like you!

884
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,430
On three!

885
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,100
Let's all say "Beijing welcomes us!"

886
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,020
Come on!

887
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,790
Three, two, one!

888
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:18,060
Beijing welcomes us!

889
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:24,790
Zhou Shui!

890
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,020
I'm Dai Daji!

891
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,500
I came from the year 2025!

892
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:30,180
I came back just to tell you.

893
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,060
In 2025, in Beijing,

894
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,100
we broke up.

895
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:38,710
So, is everything
we're doing right now still worthy?

896
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,730
But we're not even together.

897
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,020
How can we break up?

898
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:45,540
We did break up in 2025.

899
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,660
But it's not too late now.

900
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,950
I just want to know.

901
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,270
If we're destined
to break up in Beijing,

902
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,830
is everything we're doing now

903
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:01,870
still worth it?

904
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:19,580
