00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,540
(Spring 2009, Beijing)

4
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,950
You finished it?

5
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:09,820
What do you think?

6
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,910
Of course,
it's still a preliminary draft.

7
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,820
I will continue to improve and amend it.

8
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,580
It's just...

9
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,790
Is it that bad?

10
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,030
Tell me

11
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,660
which scene I wrote was not good enough.

12
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,420
I'll amend it again.

13
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,660
I think it's pretty good.

14
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,660
Zhou Shui, I think you're just crazy.

15
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,190
You...

16
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,510
No.

17
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,230
No.

18
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,380
You...

19
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,470
Are you trying to make me cry?

20
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,470
But I have to go to work. I can't cry.

21
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,790
But I really want to cry right now.

22
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,470
So it's good, right?

23
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,420
Yes.

24
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,980
It's more than good.

25
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,070
This is a masterpiece.

26
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,030
I didn't know

27
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,380
our story is this touching.

28
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,820
If this story was made into a movie

29
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,980
and seen by everyone,

30
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,420
everyone will know about our story.

31
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,630
Our story is called...

32
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,230
I haven't named it yet.

33
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,750
It's not important.

34
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,630
It's not important, bro.

35
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,070
What's important

36
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,950
is that I didn't misjudge you.

37
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,510
You're a genius.

38
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,980
Genius.

39
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,790
All the film production companies

40
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,030
will scramble to get your script

41
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,310
after seeing it.

42
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,540
They'll let you film it.

43
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,190
When that happens,

44
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,470
you're going to be famous.

45
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,980
Let me get a piece of that.

46
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,190
I will really become famous!

47
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,310
You will become famous!

48
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,510
I will become famous!

49
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,140
This is a good script!

50
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,980
People all over the world will envy us!

51
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,630
Sliding again.

52
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,910
Wait.

53
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,310
Wait.

54
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,260
I heard you guys talking on the subway.

55
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,720
You wrote a movie script, didn't you?

56
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,030
I want to make movies too.

57
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,350
Let me show you something.

58
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,640
Do you want to participate
in this script competition?

59
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,680
They're looking for original stories.

60
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,080
If you're shortlisted for an award,

61
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,000
there's a starting capital
of three million yuan.

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,400
They'll give you three million yuan.

63
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,020
They'll let you film your script
without a single word changed.

64
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,110
Anyway, I participated.

65
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,950
I will definitely win the award.

66
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,400
Congratulations to you then.

67
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,140
(Script Competition)
Do we need to name the script first?

68
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,020
Zhou Shui.

69
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,630
Tell me

70
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,950
if we should celebrate

71
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,900
after you submit your script.

72
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,950
For example, eating roast duck.

73
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,430
I've always wanted to eat roast duck.

74
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,760
I've been in Beijing for so long

75
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,040
but have never eaten roast duck.

76
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,340
Let's go eat roast duck.

77
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,070
What do you think?

78
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,040
Should we eat roast duck?

79
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,750
Don't disturb me.

80
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,190
I almost figured it out.

81
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,220
How about we name the script

82
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,020
before sending it?

83
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,700
No.

84
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,550
Why?

85
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,220
Because I've made a wish.

86
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,340
It has to be today.

87
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,700
Today will be more effective.

88
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,020
Okay.

89
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,820
Let's call it...

90
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,430
Call it...

91
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,510
Let's call it...

92
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,430
We...

93
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,580
What's wrong?

94
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,550
What's wrong?

95
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,460
- What's wrong?
- No.

96
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,900
I suddenly felt a stomachache.

97
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,200
Did you catch a cold
because you didn't have any coat on?

98
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,070
Maybe.

99
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,020
Maybe I ate too much snacks.

100
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,700
Here?

101
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,670
Lower. Here.

102
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,340
Here?

103
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,070
Rub it.

104
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,760
Are you okay? How do you feel?

105
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,220
Okay. I'm good.

106
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,070
No.

107
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,550
What's wrong?

108
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,750
No.

109
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,550
No, it hurts more now.

110
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,070
I'm not okay at all, Zhou Shui.

111
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Let's go to the hospital.

112
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:03,820
No.

113
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,460
Let's go.

114
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,260
Is something wrong with you?

115
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,750
Get dressed. Let's go.

116
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,870
Pay the fee.

117
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,310
The abdominal ultrasonography
and blood tests

118
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,140
are necessary.

119
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:17,460
Okay.

120
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,550
The nurse will take her
to draw blood later.

121
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,680
Get an injection to stop the pain
after you pay the fee.

122
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,900
Doctor, is this expensive?

123
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,260
It's fine. Thank you, Doctor.

124
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,820
Hello.

125
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:33,950
Medical records.

126
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,220
The total cost of pain relief
is 600 yuan.

127
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,700
Three examinations cost 3,200 yuan.

128
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,820
It totals to 3,800 yuan.

129
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,240
How do you want to pay?

130
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,020
What examinations?

131
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,580
Are they more expensive than medicine?

132
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,430
You need to ask the doctor for details.

133
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,380
I'm only responsible
for pricing and charging.

134
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,460
I'll pay with card.

135
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,580
Doctor.

136
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,510
Close the door first.

137
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:16,990
Okay.

138
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,220
The blood results just came out.

139
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,990
We're not sure yet.

140
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,260
Did her company provided
health insurance coverage for her?

141
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,140
Health insurance?

142
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:28,840
She's an intern.

143
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,560
She probably
doesn't have medical insurance.

144
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,040
You're paying yourself then.

145
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,750
Yes.

146
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,510
But if you're paying yourself,
it may be more expensive.

147
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,220
You have to be prepared mentally.

148
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,780
It's okay. The cost isn't important.

149
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,580
Just cure her.

150
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,430
What is her current situation?

151
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,750
Her indicators

152
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,990
are all abnormal.

(Beijing Jinqiang Hospital)

154
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,460
Let's take a taxi.

155
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,950
Why do we suddenly need a taxi?

156
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,780
Aren't your stomach upset?

157
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,950
It's okay. I'm much better now.

158
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,110
What time is it now?

159
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,340
It's past 10 PM.

160
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:03,990
It's past 10 PM?

161
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,780
Let's hurry to catch
the last subway train.

162
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,380
Daji.

163
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,820
It's okay, I can walk.

164
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,340
I can really walk.

165
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,960
You won't walk as fast as me.

166
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,140
Why don't we try another hospital?

167
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,870
Spare the effort. It's a waste of money.

168
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,910
How do you feel? Feeling better?

169
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,390
Much better than before.

170
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,310
Sorry, Daji.

171
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,270
Why?

172
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,070
You're sick, but I still brought you
to take the subway.

173
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,120
What's wrong with that?
Let's just take the subway.

174
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,980
Maybe I'll recover after farting.

175
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,520
You're already in so much pain,
why are you still fooling around?

176
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,030
Be careful.

177
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,790
Wait a while. It's not here yet.

178
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,030
What disease did the doctor say I have?

179
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,860
What disease? You have no disease.

180
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,390
Why does it hurt so much then?

181
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,580
He said it's stomach ulcer.

182
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,150
Who told you to sleep so late?

183
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,310
You also eat irregularly.

184
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,460
He prescribed some medicine

185
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,720
and make your stomach stronger.

186
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,390
You'll be fine soon.

187
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,310
It's my fault

188
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,740
that you didn't register.

189
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,980
It's okay. I'll register in two days.

190
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,620
You said you thought of a name.

191
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,070
What's the name?

192
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,460
I forgot.

193
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,070
Forgot?

194
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,550
I highly suspect

195
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,190
that she has gallbladder cancer.

196
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,820
You should do a PET/CT first.

197
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,790
We can only decide
the subsequent treatment plan

198
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,190
after determining the diseased area.

199
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,310
If she doesn't have health insurance,

200
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,150
this PET/CT scan alone
costs 15,000 yuan.

201
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,620
No problem, right?

202
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,700
Young man.

203
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,430
Okay.

204
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,580
Cancer treatments

205
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,550
are long-term,

206
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,670
so you must be financially prepared.

207
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,390
You said before that shooting weddings

208
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,500
is a waste of time and life.

209
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,280
You even went back to writing scripts.
Why do you want to film again?

210
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,100
I'm in urgent need of money.

211
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,980
How can an artist like you
be in urgent need of money?

212
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:34,820
Back then,

213
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,950
I was too naive.

214
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,390
I apologize, alright?

215
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,220
How did you become mature in two months?

216
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,070
Don't worry about these, okay?

217
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,580
Just give me something to do.
I can do anything.

218
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,310
Film meetings, children's birthdays,

219
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:47,920
or a wedding.

220
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,840
I'm fine with anything.

221
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,480
You can even ask me to film
while kneeling.

222
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,640
Anyway, just give me any jobs.

223
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,640
I beg you, okay? Help me.

224
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,910
You have to tell me the truth then.

225
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,150
What happened to you?

226
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,700
How can I help you if you don't tell me?

227
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,950
So Daji has to get checked out
right away

228
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,070
to decide her treatment.

229
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,460
I recently returned to work
at the wedding service company,

230
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,220
but it's the off-season recently,
so there isn't much work.

231
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,580
I know it's not easy for everyone.

232
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,860
If it's not because I have no other way,
I won't ask you either.

233
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,430
I hope everyone

234
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,550
and help me a little bit.

235
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,150
Shui, business isn't good this year.

236
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,860
All my money is here.

237
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,790
We can't offer

238
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,670
any more than this.

239
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,950
Thank you. Really, thank you.

240
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,430
I don't earn much.

241
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,980
These are all I have now.

242
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,860
I'll give you more
after I get my salary.

243
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,820
There's a bit more here.

244
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,030
Thank you all.

245
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,790
Yesterday.

246
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,190
I just counted.
There's about 2,000 yuan.

247
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,310
That's all I have. Take them.

248
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,150
Thank you.

249
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,910
Thank you all. Really.

250
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:04,920
You've been a great help.

251
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,100
Anyway, I will work hard
to make money during the peak season.

252
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,720
I will pay you back as soon as possible.

253
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,360
- Isn't this still not enough?
- Thank you.

254
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,740
It's enough.

255
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,860
I'll borrow the rest from my parents.

256
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,950
How much more?

257
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,800
(I, Shen Jingshu,)

258
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,360
(owe Li Dongting 10,000 yuan.)

259
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,360
(Debtor: Shen Jingshu)

260
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,030
Dongting.

261
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,790
Jingshu.

262
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,950
What can I do for you?

263
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,910
Take this first.

264
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,620
IOU?

265
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,150
I had a problem
with my financial aid earlier.

266
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,390
You said you could lend me 10,000 yuan.

267
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,340
Does it still count?

268
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,270
Of course.

269
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,680
I'll go back and get it for you now.

270
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:48,820
There's no rush.

271
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,270
Keep the IOU.

272
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,070
Thank you.

273
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,980
Lend me this money for emergency first.

274
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,910
I'll pay you back later.

275
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,670
Sure.

276
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:01,740
Shui.

277
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,190
Jingshu, what's the matter?

278
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,070
Take this 10,000 yuan.

279
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,310
10,000 yuan?

280
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,030
Take it.

281
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,700
It's a lot of money.

282
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,430
It's fine.

283
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,550
Take Daji to get checked out right away.

284
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,700
Thank you, Jingshu.

285
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,950
I thank you on behalf of Daji.

286
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,430
I know
it's not easy for you to get this money.

287
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,200
How about this?
Wait for me to make money.

288
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,720
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

289
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,760
- Is that okay?
- It's fine.

290
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,160
There's no hurry in paying me back.

291
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,670
Daji is my only friend in Beijing.

292
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,950
She's considered
the closest family I have.

293
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,920
Just take the money

294
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,580
and get her checked out
as soon as possible.

295
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:40,620
Thank you.

296
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:42,790
Thank you.

297
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,860
Stop talking, hurry along.

298
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:45,860
Thank you, Jingshu.

299
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,390
Go.

300
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,190
Zhou Shui.

301
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,920
I'm really hungry.

302
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,150
(Beijing Jinqiang Hospital)

303
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,340
I think I'm going to die of hunger.

304
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,700
Didn't the doctor say

305
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,430
that you need to fast
for this examination.

306
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,580
You have no choice.

307
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,550
Go in for your examination.

308
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,500
I'll buy you some food at the entrance.

309
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,270
Really?

310
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,550
What do you want to eat?

311
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,700
I want baked sweet potatoes.

312
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,580
Baked sweet potatoes?

313
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,220
No more?

314
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,340
That's all?

315
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,100
What do you mean that's all?
You don't get it.

316
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,860
Winter's roasted sweet potatoes

317
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,310
are known as the best food
in the country.

318
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,580
Chubby sweet potatoes

319
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,030
are put in a stove
and rotate while roasting.

320
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,460
They're roasted till they're burnt.

321
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,150
It's very hot when you take it out.

322
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,100
Then there's yellow honey
flowing outside.

323
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,310
Open it.

324
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,580
It smells so good.

325
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,550
I'm so hungry.

326
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,910
I'm a little hungry after what you said.

327
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,800
Cao Liang, Dai Daji. Right?

328
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,270
This examination takes a long time.
Please wait a while longer.

329
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,240
Are you a family member?

330
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,080
- Hello.
- Family members need to wait outside.

331
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,150
I can't wait here, right?

332
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:54,820
Yes.

333
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,030
Don't be afraid of pain.

334
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,070
Be strong.

335
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,500
Be good.

336
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:01,950
Good luck.

337
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,500
Girl.

338
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,190
How old are you?

339
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,430
23.

340
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,190
How young. What a pity.

341
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,620
Pity?

342
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,340
Are you here for PET/CT as well?

343
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,430
Yes.

344
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,190
You don't know.

345
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,860
Ever since I got this disease,

346
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,860
PET/CT had to be done once a year.

347
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,950
Let alone chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

348
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,220
Sir.

349
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,860
I have stomach ulcer.

350
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,860
I probably don't need
radiotherapy or chemotherapy.

351
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,700
What stomach ulcer?

352
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,070
Why do you need to do PET/CT
for stomach ulcer?

353
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,310
I have liver cancer.

354
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,340
I think

355
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,030
I can't hold on for a few more years.

356
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,300
Girl.

357
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,220
What kind of cancer do you have?

358
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:42,950
Hello.

359
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,800
- Sweet potatoes...
-Do you want sweet potatoes?

360
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,390
How much is it?

361
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,430
One for three yuan. Two for five yuan.

362
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,910
Buy two. There's a good deal for two.

363
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,630
I just want one.

364
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,460
Sure.

365
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,460
Young man.

366
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,110
What's the matter?

367
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,870
Young man.

368
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,780
You have to comfort

369
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,300
your girlfriend.

370
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,300
Everyone will be afraid

371
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,910
after getting this disease.

372
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,700
It's really pitiful.

373
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,020
Daji.

374
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,840
I'm back.

375
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,220
How come you were gone for so long?

376
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,880
I've been waiting for you
for a long time.

377
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,150
Where's my roasted sweet potato?

378
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,220
I thought it's sold
at the hospital entrance,

379
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,540
but I ran two miles before finding it.

380
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,980
I'm sorry I'm back late.

381
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,080
You waited for a long time.

382
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,220
You've worked hard.

383
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,020
No.

384
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,910
It's still hot.

385
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:17,670
Try it.

386
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,540
This is
the type of baked sweet potato I want.

387
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,630
The burnt type.

388
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,020
It's so sweet.

389
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,300
Is it good?

390
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,020
It's good
that I didn't buy the wrong type.

391
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,240
You didn't buy the wrong type.

392
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,630
Eat slowly.

393
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,260
Does it hurt?

394
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,500
No.

395
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,740
The examination didn't hurt at all.

396
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,950
But I just found that machine scary

397
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,020
when I was in there.

398
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,540
I just wanted to cry.

399
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,980
But I didn't cry.

400
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,540
I held back.

401
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,740
Good job.

402
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,870
I'm super strong.

403
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,950
You've already melded so many tiles.
Hurry up with this round...

404
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,390
No.

405
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,950
I can't believe my girl.

406
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,150
She calls me every day.

407
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:26,980
Hello?

408
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,950
Why are you still awake at this hour?
What are you doing?

409
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,740
No.

410
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,500
What's up?

411
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,110
Are you asking me for money again?

412
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,980
No.

413
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,260
I just miss you a little.

414
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,950
You can miss me tomorrow.
I'm not free today.

415
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,020
I'm playing mahjong.

416
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,020
Tomorrow?

417
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,870
I'm afraid it will be too late tomorrow.

418
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,460
Why did you draw again?

419
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:53,870
What's too late?

420
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:54,670
What did you say?

421
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,160
How come it will be too late tomorrow?

422
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,560
You played another nine of circles.

423
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,260
Draw!

424
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,150
What do you want? Tell me now.

425
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:01,920
Nothing.

426
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,320
(Welcome to Beijing)
Mom, you're playing mahjong.

427
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,350
What tiles are you drawing?
Are they good tiles?

428
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,120
What tiles am I drawing?
How can I tell you that?

429
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,590
Silly child.

430
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,460
I can only tell you after I draw.

431
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,350
Right?

432
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,110
Alright.

433
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,870
Don't hang up then.

434
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,020
I just want to hear you draw tiles.

435
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:21,980
Why are you so nice

436
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,520
that you'll play mahjong with me today?

437
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,500
- Kong.
- Wait.

438
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,430
You even kong-ed? You...

439
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,060
Play slowly.

440
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,300
Don't panic.

441
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,460
There's no rush.

442
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,260
I want to draw, I'm telling you.

443
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,260
I want to draw the best tiles this time.

444
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,220
How dare you play circles?

445
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,020
Nine of circles.

446
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,020
I don't want it.

447
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,320
(On 17 March 2009,)

448
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,740
(The Central Committee of the CCP
and State Council released)

449
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,430
(Opinions on Deepening the Reform
of the Medical and Health System.)

450
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,830
(The opinions put forward)

451
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,880
(five key reform measures
to effectively alleviate)

452
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,260
(the difficulty and high cost
of seeing a doctor)

453
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,740
(and the long-term goal
of establishing and improving)

454
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,440
(a basic medical and health system
covering urban and rural residents.)

455
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,670
(My country's medical reform
officially enters the critical stage.)

456
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:14,780
Today, I booked a train ticket
back to my hometown.

457
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,830
Whether I get sick or die

458
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,350
is my own business.

459
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,190
I can face it alone.

460
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,590
I don't want Zhou Shui to suffer for me.

461
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,630
But I still have

462
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,870
many unfulfilled wishes in Beijing.

463
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,630
There are many things
I want to do with him

464
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,780
that I haven't done.

465
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,880
The train ticket
is for the day after tomorrow.

466
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,110
Our love

467
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,780
has 24 hours left.

468
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,740
Daji.

469
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,590
Hurry over.

470
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,300
Didn't I tell you to lie down in bed?

471
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,430
I bought you some cherries.

472
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,910
Don't you want to eat?
Let's go downstairs to eat some.

473
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:12,980
They're expensive.

474
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,700
Yes.

475
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,540
Let's go.

476
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,120
Zhou Shui.

477
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,020
- Stop sitting.
- Wait.

478
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,780
Can you sit down for a while
and chat with me?

479
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,020
Fine.

480
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,110
I just bought you something.

481
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:23,460
A gift?

482
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,590
You're still spending...

483
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,500
You can now use

484
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,740
the lens you had, right?

485
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,670
Have you lost your mind, Daji?

486
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,630
What are you doing?

487
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,670
No, you...

488
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,430
Why did you buy me
a digital video camera?

489
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,780
I wanted to buy it for you.

490
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,190
Where's the receipt?

491
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,080
- Calm down
- Give me the receipt.

492
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,980
I'll refund it. Hurry.

493
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,460
I want you to film something for me.

494
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,600
What do you want me to film?

495
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,630
I just want you to film something.

496
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,630
Why are you asking this?

497
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,740
Just film if I ask you to.

498
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,590
I'm not filming.

499
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,980
Return the digital video camera.

500
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,700
Tell me what you want to film.

501
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,590
Just help me film.

502
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,500
Just consider me leaving my will.

503
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:04,540
What?

504
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,190
What will?

505
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:09,780
You're not dying.

506
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,980
Why leave a will?

507
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,630
- What if I...
- You just got a stomach ulcer.

508
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,120
A stomach ulcer won't kill you.

509
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,740
No, think about it calmly.

510
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,980
Whenever I have a stomachache,

511
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,300
I couldn't eat.

512
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,540
I can't eat for a long period of time.
If people don't eat, they will die.

513
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,540
Stomach ulcers can kill.

514
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,060
What are you doing?

515
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,460
Zhou Shui.

516
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,870
Well... About my scene,

517
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,540
I want to invite Palme d'Or
to complete it with me.

518
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,020
Sure.

519
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:41,670
Okay.

520
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,670
Usually, it starts

521
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,260
by saying that...

522
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,150
That Ac...

523
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,220
Action.

524
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,300
No, wait.

525
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,390
Wait a little longer.

526
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,150
Let me fix my outfit.

527
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,020
How do I look?

528
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,670
- You're beautiful.
- I'm beautiful?

529
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,300
That's good.

530
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,430
Come on then.

531
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,060
I'm ready.

532
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,700
Okay.

533
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,390
Hello, Zhou Shui.

534
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,220
I'm Dai Daji.

535
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,740
From January 2008

536
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,780
to February 2009,

537
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,870
I've been your girlfriend.

538
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,700
I've been happy

539
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,630
every single day of this past year
with you.

540
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,060
But now...

541
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,300
Now...

542
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,190
Zhou Shui, now...

543
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,740
I have to go.

544
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,060
Where are you going?

545
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,430
I'm going

546
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,300
to a paradise

547
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,740
free from pain
and filled with happiness.

548
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,390
Cut.

549
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,670
What are you doing?

550
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,060
I just got emotional.

551
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,350
What are you saying?
You're not allowed to talk nonsense.

552
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,830
- I'm...
- Act well.

553
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:04,350
But aren't movies all nonsense?

554
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,920
Who made a movie made of nonsense?

555
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,670
Director Zhou,
can you be more professional?

556
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,670
I'm very professional.

557
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,220
Hold up the camera then.

558
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,430
The money in this ICBC account

559
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:15,910
is my salary.

560
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,630
There's about 5,000 yuan.

561
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,460
Use it to pay the rent.

562
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:28,220
And this Agricultural Bank card

563
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,390
is for the living expenses
my mom usually sends me.

564
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,700
There's not much left.

565
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:34,700
Use it for food

566
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,780
and some daily necessities.

567
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,500
Save some money.
Don't spend it recklessly.

568
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,110
And

569
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,700
these two down jackets

570
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,350
are expensive,

571
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,390
so I have always been reluctant
to wear it.

572
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,740
I'll give them to you now.

573
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,590
Be nice to them.

574
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:54,300
Okay.

575
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,670
Speaking of,

576
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,390
there's also the honey cake

577
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,300
in the refrigerator

578
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,830
that we bought during Chinese New Year.

579
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,190
It's expensive and delicious,
but don't be reluctant to eat it.

580
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,150
Finish it quickly.

581
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,590
Don't let it expire.

582
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,260
No, who would want

583
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,060
your junk?

584
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,540
No one will steal them from me.

585
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,830
Are these worth making a will?

586
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,020
Yes.

587
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,350
Why is my will

588
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,430
so short?

589
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:25,670
Zhou Shui.

590
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,830
I don't want to make a will anymore.

591
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,830
Fulfill my last wish.

592
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,780
I've been in Beijing
for more than a year,

593
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,830
but I've never eaten roast duck.

594
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,150
Zhou Shui.

595
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,220
I want to eat roast duck.

596
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,430
Take me to eat roast duck.

597
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,260
I want to eat Quanjude's.

598
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,220
I want to eat
the most expensive roast duck.

599
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,300
I want to order
a whole set of roast duck.

600
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,720
No, Zhou Shui.
What's the meaning of this?

601
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,590
Where's the roast duck?
Where's Quanjude's roast duck?

602
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,500
There's duck meat in here.

603
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,430
Look for it carefully.

604
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,700
There are only a few leaves here.

605
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,500
Roast duck is too oily.

606
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,060
The doctor said you can't eat.

607
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,800
Duck soup and roast duck
are both made of duck.

608
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,670
This can somewhat nourish your body.

609
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,740
You just don't want
to spend money on me.

610
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,540
You're stingy.

611
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,780
We have to save up
for your medical treatment.

612
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,630
Zhou Shui.

613
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,950
I'm telling you seriously.

614
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,700
Stop thinking about me.

615
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,630
You'll get emotionally entangled with me
and can't move on.

616
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,260
Do you get it?

617
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,740
Forget about me immediately.

618
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,540
You still have a long way to go.

619
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,390
You deserve someone better.

620
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,260
Find someone better than me.

621
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,110
Most importantly,

622
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,870
she must be in good health.

623
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,240
You need to buy her vitamin C
and take her for a physical examination.

624
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,430
You have to take precautions.
Don't let her be like me.

625
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,540
Promise me.

626
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,500
Promise me.

627
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,870
Hurry up and promise me.

628
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,390
Okay, I promise you.

629
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,390
You promised me?

630
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,060
I promise you.

631
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:08,540
No, you...

632
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,910
Why did you promise me?

633
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,590
You promised me so quickly.

634
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,720
You asked me to promise you.

635
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,430
No, it's too fast.

636
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,390
I'm not gone yet.

637
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,430
Do you really
want to find a new girlfriend?

638
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,920
You're accusing me wrongly.

639
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,320
Why are you like this?
I haven't left yet.

640
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,060
And you're already thinking
about what's next?

641
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,040
- You're accusing me wrongly.
- You're saving money

642
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,460
to buy roast duck for the next girl.

643
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,670
You can't say that.

644
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:35,740
Old Chives.

645
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:39,700
I never ate chives

646
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,220
before I came to Beijing.

647
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,260
I never took a single bite.

648
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,830
After eating
the chive dumplings you made,

649
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:47,060
I think chive stuffing is the best.

650
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,020
You should eat more then.

651
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,390
You will definitely
buy a shop in Beijing

652
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,870
in the future.

653
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:56,870
Of course.

654
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:02,980
Glasses, Vest.

655
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,870
You guys are really unkempt

656
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,590
and old-fashioned.

657
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,780
You don't look like you have any talent.

658
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,350
You...

659
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,780
But I believe in you two.

660
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,260
You can definitely make

661
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,910
the best game in the country.

662
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,390
You'll make our own game.

663
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:16,260
Yes.

664
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,190
- Well said.
- Well said.

665
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,590
I'll accept your well wishes.

666
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,980
Can you lend me some money?

667
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,780
I have no money,

668
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,910
but I hope you find true love.

669
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,500
I'll accept that.

670
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,670
103, 104,

671
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,060
105.

672
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,500
Dumbbell, good job.

673
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,540
Your muscles.

674
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,460
Of course.

675
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:33,460
You will

676
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,150
definitely become the best bodybuilder

677
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,630
in China.

678
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,430
Definitely.

679
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,460
Of course.

680
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,500
I'll do 100 more reps.

681
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,500
I'm exhausted, Zhou Shui.

682
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,440
- Hug.
- It's alright.

683
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,520
I've stopped recording you.

684
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,110
What's wrong?

685
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,590
You're really my best friend

686
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,700
in Beijing.

687
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,910
You're also my best friend in Beijing.

688
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,740
We'll be best friends forever.

689
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,830
Best friends forever.

690
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:53,870
Jingshu.

691
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,190
What's wrong?

692
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,110
Dumbbell, here.

693
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,430
You two
must take good care of yourselves.

694
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,350
You two must stay together forever.

695
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,870
What do you mean by together?

696
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,240
We're not together.
What do you mean by together?

697
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,160
We're not together yet.

698
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,400
We're just together as friends.

699
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,600
- Friends, good friends.
- Yes.

700
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,000
We're all together as good friends.

701
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:11,830
Forget this part.

702
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:12,520
Don't edit it in.

703
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,190
Stop recording.

704
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,440
- Stop recording.
- Edit it out.

705
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:15,980
You can keep it.

706
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,020
Keep it.

707
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,300
Chunzhili Residence

708
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,150
is

709
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,350
my favorite place in Beijing.

710
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,870
Although it's dirty and messy,

711
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,260
everything here

712
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,260
makes me feel particularly at home.

713
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:31,500
Zhou Shui.

714
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:32,980
Promise me

715
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,950
you'll come to this place

716
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:35,760
to make another movie

717
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,280
when you can make movies in the future.

718
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,910
Sure, I promise you.

719
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,260
Then...

720
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,260
Then, make a copy
after you finish making the movie.

721
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,670
Burn it for me afterward.

722
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,910
This way,
I can watch it from over there.

723
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,540
Okay.

724
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,460
You're laughing?

725
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,500
This is a tragic scene. Promise me.

726
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,830
I promise you.

727
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,700
But if you're not by my side,

728
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,150
I probably won't come back
to make a movie.

729
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:09,980
Maybe your life

730
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,910
will be much easier without me.

731
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,190
Look.

732
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,300
You wouldn't shoot weddings
you don't like.

733
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,110
You wouldn't be scammed.

734
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,220
Your digital video camera won't break.

735
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,060
You're even less likely
to spend all your money

736
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,950
because of an illness
if it weren't for me.

737
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,430
Maybe you've

738
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:29,910
become a film director by now.

739
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,300
Our love

740
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,670
isn't worth it.

741
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:41,950
Here, Daji.

742
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,780
Hold this.

743
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,590
Daji, listen carefully.

744
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,480
If it weren't for you,

745
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,560
I wouldn't have been so resolute
in coming to Beijing.

746
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,600
If it weren't for you,

747
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,260
I wouldn't have encountered
so many setbacks

748
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,830
and still insisted on making movies.

749
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:56,590
Let alone

750
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,020
write this movie script.

751
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:00,670
Without you,

752
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,590
I, Zhou Shui, is nothing. Really.

753
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,870
So I think you're wrong.

754
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,780
Coming to Beijing with you

755
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,950
is the best decision I've ever made.

756
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,740
Everything we've been through,

757
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,430
whether it's good or bad,

758
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,700
happy or sad,

759
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,390
everything we've through is worth it!

760
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,060
Including our love.

761
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,700
It's worth it!

762
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,830
It's all worth it!

763
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,390
I got it.

764
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:55,700
What did you get?

765
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,500
I got it.

766
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,300
I know what our movie

767
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,540
should be called now.

768
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,520
What should it be called?

769
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,740
Such A Good Love.

770
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:06,700
Such A Good Love.

771
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:11,980
Such A Good Love?

772
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:20,660
Okay.

773
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,920
We'll call it Such A Good Love.

774
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:45,500
(Pulp Fiction)

775
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:01,100
Zhou Shui, you darn liar.

776
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,100
Is Shichahai a sea?

777
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,430
Will the sea freeze?

778
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,870
Is Shichahai

779
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,580
as small as you?

780
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,100
You're not a sea at all!

781
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,180
In Beijing,

782
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,230
it's the sea.

783
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:50,100
But when can little shrimps like us

784
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,980
swim into the sea?

785
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:05,500
Aren't we already in the sea?

786
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,460
Where are you going?

787
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:19,020
Daji.

788
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,620
I'm going home, Zhou Shui.

789
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,620
I already know what disease I have.

790
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,950
But we haven't
finished filming the movie.

791
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,180
Okay.

792
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,270
Let's finish

793
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:45,980
the last scene of our movie here.

794
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:47,580
Come on.

795
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,830
(Dramatic Effect, Please Do Not Imitate)

796
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:57,620
Zhou Shui.

797
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,660
We're really in the sea now.

798
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,660
Daji, don't leave.

799
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:13,910
Did you hear that?

800
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,060
If the ice breaks now,

801
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:23,660
will the two of us
drift further and further apart

802
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,310
and never see each other again?

803
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,430
No way.

804
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,830
As long as we hold hands forever,

805
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,620
we can stick together again

806
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,310
even if the ice breaks.

807
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,060
We'll never separate.

808
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,500
Tell me.

809
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,660
Is our story interesting?

810
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:53,950
Of course.

811
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,230
No one
has a more interesting story than ours.

812
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,620
But our story is about to end.

813
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:20,950
No.

814
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:24,500
Who said that?

815
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,310
Me.

816
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,840
What gives you the final say?

817
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,180
I'm the director.

818
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,660
I have the final say
on whether the story ends.

819
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,580
Daji, listen carefully.

820
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,390
I don't want your credit card.

821
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,390
I don't want your down jackets either.

822
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:57,830
You have to keep these in Beijing
for your own use.

823
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:02,950
I won't find another girlfriend.

824
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,460
Never.

825
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:07,980
You're all I want.

826
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,060
We'll take the subway together.

827
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,920
We'll take it until the total distance
is enough to circle the earth once,

828
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,350
twice, and third.

829
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,980
I'll give you a unique wedding.

830
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,750
A wedding that belongs only to us.

831
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,950
That's our ending.

832
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:53,660
