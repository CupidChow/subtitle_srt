00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,150
Tong Leyi, a great discovery!

5
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,150
A great discovery!

6
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,300
I've sent it to your WeChat.

7
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,740
I found a picture
on Dai Daji's birthday post

8
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,430
on Weibo.

9
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,950
Are there two people

10
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,630
in the reflection on the wine glass

11
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,030
beside the sashimi platter?

12
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,510
The one on the left is Ms. Dai.

13
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,070
The man on the right...

14
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,630
Why are they so close together?

15
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,700
Who is this?

16
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,820
Let me zoom in.

17
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,470
It's blurry.

18
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,140
Let me enhance the picture.

19
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,140
Got it.

20
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,310
Who is this?

21
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,580
It's not Zhou Shui.

22
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,070
Who is he?

23
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,510
I think I saw someone
wearing this cap in the office.

24
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,790
Gosh! It's Lin Chenxing!

25
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,380
Lin Chenxing?

26
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,030
Who is Lin Chenxing?

27
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,580
Don't you know Lin Chenxing?

28
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,630
He has many fans on Weibo

29
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,070
and is very popular now.

30
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,750
He is the male lead of Ms. Dai's film.

31
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,920
(Lin Chenxing)
Look at his cap.

32
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,320
It's the same as the one
on the reflection of the wine glass.

33
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,660
Why is it him?

34
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,380
Look. This is Lin Chenxing, right?

35
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,980
The one beside him is Ms. Dai.

36
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,260
This is so exciting.

37
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,070
I wonder what Ms. Dai would say.

38
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,660
Leyi.

39
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,760
Come and see this.

40
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,880
- What is it?
- Look at this.

41
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,420
There's even a video.

42
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,140
It's trending immediately. Look.

43
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:13,910
What is trending?

44
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,820
Yesterday,
Lin Chenxing went home with Daji...

45
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,040
What?

46
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,600
Their pictures were taken by paparazzi.

47
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,040
Let me see.

48
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,230
I wonder if it's true.

49
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,380
Oh no. This proves it.

50
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,070
Mr. Hong is here.

51
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:24,540
Hurry.

52
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,310
He has come here?

53
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:25,980
Let's go.

54
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,580
What?

55
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,540
(Boycott Huanteng Films)

56
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,310
Hello, Mr. Hong.

57
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,310
Where is Dai Daji?

58
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,140
Who is this?

59
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,580
The terrifying Mr. Hong.

60
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,760
This is a serious matter now.

61
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,660
Get her out here.

62
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,840
(The Four, Filming Ceremony)
Geng!

63
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,660
(2011 Beginning of Autumn, Beijing)
All right. I'm going to be there soon.

64
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,260
Geng!

65
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,070
Everyone,

66
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,190
please cooperate and not stand here.

67
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,750
We are filming inside.

68
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,070
Please help us out, all right?

69
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,350
Is Geng coming today, Security?

70
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,750
I'm not a security guard.

71
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,230
Daji.

72
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:02,750
Hurry.

73
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,470
What's going on?

74
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,510
Why did they ask you
to carry the lunch boxes?

75
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,260
There's no choice. We are "orphans".

76
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,980
We have the lowest status.

77
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,350
Time to eat!

78
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:15,860
Time to eat!

79
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,070
Actor's assistant!

80
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,870
Geng's lunchbox today.

81
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,780
He's not eating today.

82
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,580
He's not eating?

83
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,580
That's wonderful.

84
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,190
Why are you so excited
about distributing lunch boxes?

85
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,020
I feel happy.

86
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:28,990
Here you go.

87
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,240
Do you think we've come
to Shendu Pictures

88
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,430
just to distribute lunchboxes?

89
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,280
I'm not going to accept this.

90
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,800
We should work together
and create a miracle

91
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,260
instead of distributing lunch boxes.

92
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,260
Me too.

93
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,460
So, I've decided

94
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,190
to give myself a drumstick today.

95
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,900
Daji, you're amazing.

96
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,380
Where's my lunchbox?

97
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,700
Preserved Vegetable Pork Belly.

98
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,870
Kung Pao Chicken.

99
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,950
Sweet and Sour Tenderloin.

100
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,140
Fried Mushrooms.
Stir-fried Shredded Potato.

101
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,310
It's a feast.

102
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,260
Aren't they going to eat
all these dishes?

103
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,140
We got lucky.

104
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,670
Let's eat.

105
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,670
Let's eat.

106
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,780
Don't eat rice first.

107
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,990
Eat the meat.

108
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:14,900
Eat the meat.

109
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,220
Gosh.

110
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,260
Look at this fatty tenderloin.

111
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,430
It's so satisfying.

112
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:25,870
Tell me.

113
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,630
Are we going
to distribute lunchboxes our whole life?

114
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,460
No way.

115
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,340
Our crew has been disbanded
and we aren't allowed to shoot films.

116
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,580
What's the meaning of staying here?

117
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,020
What do you mean?

118
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,220
Are you quitting?

119
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,340
I was wondering

120
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,430
if I should resign.

121
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,430
Resigning is easy.

122
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,630
When can we get another job?

123
00:05:48,752 --> 00:05:49,580
Let's find one.

124
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,310
We'll surely get a job.

125
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,460
However,

126
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,000
what will you do during this period
when you're looking for a job?

127
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,550
How can you pay for rent?

128
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,240
How can you pay for the utility bill?

129
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,720
How can you pay for social insurance?

130
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,220
We are still staying in Yanjiao.

131
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,510
It rhymes.

132
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,340
You are gifted.

133
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,070
So,

134
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,670
who will pay these expenses for us?

135
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,380
I don't want

136
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,820
to return to our past lives.

137
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,460
We can't resign indeed.

138
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,700
I dare not.

139
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,380
I will never dare to resign again.

140
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,990
Zhou Shui! Daji!

141
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,110
I was wondering where both of you were.
Having a feast here?

142
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,310
Come and find me later.
I have something to tell you later.

143
00:06:40,877 --> 00:06:42,670
There's no need to hide it.
I saw everything.

144
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,674
Take your time.
Come and find me after you're done!

145
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,460
What's the crime of
stealing lunchboxes?

146
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,020
I think it'll be fine.

147
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,510
I think so too.

148
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,700
I want to ask you about something.

149
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,220
Tell me about your future plans

150
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,990
and what you want to do.

151
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,220
We will obey any arrangements
and work seriously.

152
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,220
Tell me the truth.

153
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,950
I want to shoot a film.

154
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,190
I'm leaving Shendu Pictures

155
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,750
and establishing my own company.

156
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,340
The only people I want with me

157
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,110
are both of you.

158
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,140
Don't you have any questions for me?

159
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,510
Why us?

160
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,320
Both of you are young

161
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,700
and have ideas.

162
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,260
You only lack opportunities.

163
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,240
Shendu Pictures
can't give you opportunities

164
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,750
but I can.

165
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,140
Is the opportunity you speak of

166
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,510
an opportunity to shoot a film?

167
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,430
The company has just been founded.

168
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,380
We still need to make the videos

169
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,340
we used to film.

170
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,070
Don't overthink.

171
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,780
Every famous director in the world

172
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,550
begins by filming low-budget movies.

173
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,950
Nolan. Spielberg.

174
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,950
Zhang Yimou. Chen Kaige.

175
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,260
All of them are the same.

176
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,700
I trust your abilities.

177
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,800
Both of you won't be making
low-budget films forever.

178
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,510
Right?

179
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,460
Yes.

180
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,430
Yes.

181
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:03,870
However...

182
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,550
Well...

183
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,780
The weather doesn't suit
such inspirational words.

184
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,260
It doesn't feel right.

185
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,020
The harder it is in life,

186
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,670
the more you need to build hope.

187
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,780
If there's no problem,

188
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,550
go and get your resignation processed
with the HR department.

189
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,580
That's right.

190
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,110
Don't let anyone know about this.

191
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,440
Do you have any more questions?

192
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,400
If we resign now,

193
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,000
what will happen
to our salary this month

194
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,550
and social insurance?

195
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,190
Get your resignation processed first.

196
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,270
Both of your files

197
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,910
will be transferred
to my company directly.

198
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,640
Your social insurance
will not be terminated.

199
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,500
As for your salary,

200
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,740
I'll pay you 1,000 yuan more

201
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,950
from what you are earning

202
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,220
at this place.

203
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,480
Bonus and commission
are extra, what do you think?

204
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,100
Sure.

205
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,270
That's wonderful.

206
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,820
Do you feel relieved now?

207
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,860
Thanks, Zhaoyang.

208
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,700
Zhaoyang.

209
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,480
I have one last question.

210
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,460
Can we really make a film in the end?

211
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,030
Don't worry.

212
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:08,820
If you work with me,

213
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,100
I will be responsible

214
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,500
for your future.

215
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,550
Believe in me and believe in yourselves.

216
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,670
We will surely make a film.

217
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,440
Are you feeling reluctant to leave?

218
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,550
I think I should stand here for a while

219
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,980
at this time and place.

220
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,220
Just a while?

221
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,390
Just a while.

222
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,220
Tell me.

223
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,950
Will our time at Shendu Pictures
be the highlight of our lives?

224
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:10,740
No.

225
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,880
It'll be after leaving this place.

226
00:10:18,883 --> 00:10:23,460
(2011 Winter, Beijing)

227
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,820
Shui!

228
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,740
The scene is almost ready.

229
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,550
Go and take a look.

230
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,740
Wait. I'm a little nervous.

231
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,070
You put a train in your script

232
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,310
but I didn't expect Zhaoyang
to get us a real train.

233
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,310
Isn't it a good thing?
Why do you feel nervous?

234
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,310
It's because
we were poor at Shendu Pictures.

235
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,200
I don't know

236
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,120
how to film a scene
that costs more than 100 yuan.

237
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,620
You are so low-class.

238
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,550
You are a director.

239
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,400
We will be shooting a film
with a budget of 20 million yuan next.

240
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,430
Stand tall.

241
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,820
Can you do it?

242
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,390
Yes!

243
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,580
Let's go!

244
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,030
Let's go!

245
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,150
Get to work.

246
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,580
The director is here.

247
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,670
Hello, Director!

248
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,820
Hello, Director!

249
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,500
Hello!

250
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,480
Good morning, Director.

251
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:16,950
Morning.

252
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:17,700
Hello, Director.

253
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:18,580
Hello.

254
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:19,700
Hello, Director.

255
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,340
Hello.

256
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,550
Director, your coffee.

257
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:23,580
Thank you.

258
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,430
Everyone, get ready.

259
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,740
Get ready!

260
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,460
Get to work!

261
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,740
Get to work!

262
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,790
Sure!

263
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:35,740
Move faster!

264
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,430
Stop walking and start running!

265
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,030
Quick! Let's get to work!

266
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,100
"Dull Love Story".

267
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:43,950
Scene one. Take one.

268
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:44,580
Action.

269
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,860
Push in.

270
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,430
Let's change another scene.

271
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,910
Li,

272
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,150
get me a close-up.

273
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,670
I want a pan like this.

274
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,340
I want to see

275
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,310
every word clearly.

276
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,390
Yes. Give me
a tighter shot of the product.

277
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,070
Let's try it once.

278
00:11:59,070 --> 00:11:59,910
Put it here.

279
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,580
Your hand is here and your face is here.

280
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:01,950
See?

281
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,460
Then, I can capture you in the shot.

282
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,220
Three, two, one, go.

283
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,740
Suits every food

284
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,620
and tastes exciting.

285
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,670
Move.

286
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,390
Make way!

287
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,070
Run!

288
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:10,740
Both of you.

289
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,600
(Kimchi)
Carry it together, both of you.

290
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,500
Okay. It's done.

291
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,500
Sorry.

292
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,550
Rolling. Let's begin.

293
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,310
Wider.

294
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,310
Yes.

295
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,580
Focus on the brand.
Otherwise, the client will scold us.

296
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,790
The brand. Show it.

297
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,430
Show the brand.

298
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,150
Cut!

299
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,340
It's a wrap!

300
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:31,950
Thank you, everyone.

301
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,270
It's a wrap for today.

302
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,100
Okay. Thank you!

303
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,190
Thank you.

304
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,390
Let's wrap up.

305
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,030
Time to go back and eat.

306
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,070
You've worked hard.

307
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,200
Director, you've worked hard.

308
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,390
Bye, Director.

309
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,840
Director, you've worked hard.

310
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,980
Director, you've worked hard.

311
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:56,700
(Director, Zhou Shui)

312
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,340
Director, you've worked hard.

313
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:22,950
You've worked hard.

314
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,360
Director, you've worked hard.

315
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,340
You're welcome.

316
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,660
(Kimchi)

317
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,480
Sure. Give it to me.

318
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,430
I've taken my lunchbox.

319
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,980
Sure. Give it to me. All right.

320
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,100
It's all right. Go and eat.

321
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,310
You're welcome.

322
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,550
Give them to me.

323
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,820
Thanks, Daji.

324
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,550
You've worked hard.

325
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,700
You are amazing today.

326
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,910
You too.

327
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,380
(2024 Autumn, Chongqing)
Zihao, walk faster.

328
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,340
Aunt, why are you looking for me?

329
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,070
I want to introduce you to someone.

330
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,950
This person

331
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,600
is the daughter
of my colleague's sister.

332
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,920
She's just like you.
She has been in Beijing for many years.

333
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,280
Then, she's also single.

334
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,670
Just meet her for a while.
See if you have anything in common.

335
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,840
Perhaps you are interested.

336
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,400
No, Aunt.

337
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,670
I don't want to know anyone new.

338
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,120
I don't have any feeling about this.

339
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,560
I don't want to be in a relationship.

340
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,740
Come on. It's just a quick meeting.

341
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,240
- It won't hurt you.
- I don't want to.

342
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,440
Aunt.

343
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,840
Go after her if you click.
Otherwise, you can become friends.

344
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,160
Chen.

345
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,670
Chen.

346
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,390
Come on.

347
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,500
This is Chen whom I told you about.

348
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:52,910
This is Zihao.

349
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,070
It's you?

350
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,790
Yatian.

351
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,950
Do you know each other?

352
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,190
Yes.

353
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,200
We've known each other for ten years.
We were classmates.

354
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,460
See?

355
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,620
Isn't this fate?

356
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:10,860
It's fate.

357
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,190
I'll leave you two alone.

358
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:12,620
No...

359
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,880
Why are you matchmaking?

360
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,620
I didn't expect

361
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,340
the first person I met to be you.

362
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,430
I broke up with that person
early this year.

363
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,550
He thought I had too many ideas

364
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,030
and gave him too much pressure.

365
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,910
Actually, isn't it a waste of time

366
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,910
if two people who are in a relationship

367
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,680
don't talk about marriage
and their future?

368
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,390
Yes.

369
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,820
Are you sad?

370
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,640
I'm fine. It's all in the past.

371
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,600
(King Yu's Palace)
Sure.

372
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,550
It's really a coincidence today.

373
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,560
I didn't expect to meet you
on an occasion like this.

374
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,390
Yes.

375
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,670
My aunt is an enthusiastic person.

376
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,310
She always likes to matchmake people.

377
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,550
It's all right.

378
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,190
Does she not know
that you have a girlfriend?

379
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,430
I don't have a girlfriend.

380
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,950
Aren't you living with the model?

381
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,910
Her?

382
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,100
There's nothing between us.

383
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,190
It was all a joke.

384
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,550
Well,

385
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,980
I'll go back and tell my aunt

386
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,950
to stop matchmaking us.

387
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,680
Actually, there's no need.

388
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,220
I mean

389
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,070
we can give it a try.

390
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,030
Didn't you say
we weren't suitable for each other?

391
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,390
Things are different
since we are back in our hometown.

392
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,500
I'm leaving. Let's meet again next time.

393
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,700
(Zhang Shiyu)

394
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,910
I'll just tell you directly.

395
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,340
I'm going to divorce your father.

396
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,310
This again?
How many times are you going to do this?

397
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,310
I'm serious this time.

398
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,430
Your father has a child
with someone else.

399
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,880
I'm going to sue for divorce.

400
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,820
I'm telling you, Tong Leyi.

401
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,740
You must be on my side this time

402
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,100
because the child
will steal your assets in the future.

403
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,110
Do you understand?

404
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,400
Prepare some materials

405
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,260
and prove that your father
is having an affair.

406
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,040
He also didn't do his duty
as your father.

407
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,830
Do you hear me?

408
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,630
Hello?

409
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,540
(There's a term in psychology)

410
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,780
(called emotional detachment order.)

411
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,910
(The trait is not feeling like a family
with your parents.)

412
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:28,880
(After experiencing it,)

413
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,500
(you'll know that there are parents
who don't love their children.)

414
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,160
(They feel guilty
about not treating their children well)

415
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,870
(but they will never
admit their mistakes.)

416
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,060
(I can't choose my parents.)

417
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,320
(I can only think about how I can
play the bad hand that was dealt to me.)

418
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,380
("Dull Love Story", Director Zhou Shui)

419
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,500
Director Zhou.

420
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,840
This is your debut work.

421
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,200
What a pity that this is
just an advertisement and not a film.

422
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,600
What's wrong with an advertisement?

423
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,960
Many directors of great films

424
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,830
started their careers
by shooting advertisements.

425
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,430
You are right.

426
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,460
Sounds reasonable.

427
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,020
When we become successful one day,

428
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,630
this will be a part of our history.

429
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,020
But my name isn't on this.

430
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,300
("Dull Love Story", Director Zhou Shui)

431
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:29,960
What did you say?

432
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,520
I'm saying...

433
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,190
Zhou Shui! Daji!

434
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,590
Come and have a meeting!

435
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,350
Sure!

436
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,680
Let's go and have a meeting first.

437
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,150
Zheng Xu!

438
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,220
It's here.

439
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,220
Look at that gaze.

440
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,390
I...

441
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:54,740
I can't take it.

442
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,390
Highly anticipated.

443
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,190
Suits every food and tastes exciting.

444
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,390
Is the client satisfied?

445
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,190
Yes.

446
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,150
You make a kimchi advertisement

447
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,830
look like a film.

448
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,430
It's very creative.

449
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,300
It's nice working with you.

450
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,680
I hope you can bring me
more creative work next time.

451
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,700
- Definitely.
- Thank you.

452
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,590
Thank you.

453
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,350
Both of you are really creative.

454
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,190
The people on the internet like this.

455
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,020
Speaking of which,

456
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,700
it does feel like a film.

457
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,780
We are telling a story
in the advertisement.

458
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,440
I think filming an advertisement
with the filmmaking method of a movie

459
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,700
can achieve the best result.

460
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,500
Of course.

461
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,390
Many great directors started
their careers filming advertisements.

462
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,300
I trust both of your abilities.

463
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,350
If you work with me...

464
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,670
- A great director.
- Film a movie.

465
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,460
We definitely will film
a a high-grossing movie.

466
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,800
- All right! A blockbuster!
- Shoot a film! No problem!

467
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,950
Is this the fried chicken shop
Mao mentioned?

468
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:54,840
Do you want to eat it?

469
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,300
Yes.

470
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,780
Buy. We'll buy a bucket!

471
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,390
Buy it.

472
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,060
How many?

473
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:58,630
A bucket!

474
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,260
A bucket?

475
00:19:59,260 --> 00:19:59,870
Let's eat!

476
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,430
We'll eat a bucket each.

477
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,740
Not sharing a pair between both of us.

478
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:04,830
That's great!

479
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,680
We don't need to
hide in the blanket anymore.

480
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,390
We'll just eat it.

481
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,390
We don't have to share a pair anymore.

482
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,630
How wonderful.

483
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,950
When I was young,

484
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:12,700
I also had a girl

485
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,390
who travelled with me because of work.

486
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,020
Really? What happened?

487
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,500
What else?

488
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,500
What happened to the girl?

489
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,150
Love when you are young.

490
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,020
How should I put it?

491
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,000
If it's the right person,
it'll become a story.

492
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,200
If it's the wrong person,
it'll become an accident.

493
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,830
Thinking back,

494
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,430
when I pursued her in university,

495
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,260
she was the prettiest girl.

496
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,780
I actually sacrificed everything.

497
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,540
However, the story after that

498
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,540
is very cliche.

499
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,200
I bought a house and a car
in Beijing for her sake.

500
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,540
I left for work in the morning

501
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,590
and came home at night.

502
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,600
Both of us were in Beijing

503
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,000
but it felt like we were
having a long-distance relationship.

504
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,080
Why do you think I did that?

505
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:52,190
Yes.

506
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,950
I was working hard in Beijing back then.
It was decent.

507
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,520
However, being in a relationship

508
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,630
is difficult.

509
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,220
When I see you both,

510
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,350
I wondered if every young couple
who came to Beijing

511
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,500
would swear an oath

512
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,980
to have a relationship in Beijing

513
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,780
that isn't cliche.

514
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,190
Yes.

515
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,500
In the end, you still lose

516
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,300
to the cliche.

517
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,260
Cheers.

518
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,350
Come on. Quick.

519
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,150
Zhaoyang.

520
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,260
You are very successful now.

521
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,060
Why didn't you chase her back?

522
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,060
Right now,

523
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,460
her child is already this tall.

524
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,680
What are you thinking about?

525
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:29,870
Well...

526
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,430
What a pity.

527
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,390
Forget about the rest.

528
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,780
Both of you

529
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,760
came to Beijing for work
after graduation.

530
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,220
What do you think?

531
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,700
When are you two getting married?

532
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,910
The rent is 2,800 yuan.

533
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,260
A unit is 1,400 yuan.

534
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,630
Internet for a month

535
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:50,870
- is 60...
- Hold on.

536
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,390
- 1,400 yuan. 60 yuan.
- Yes.

537
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,870
Calculate the water
and electricity bill.

538
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,830
65.5 yuan.

539
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,670
65.5 yuan.

540
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,540
Daji.

541
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,430
1,500 yuan.

542
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,360
My rent with Dumbbell's.
That's probably enough.

543
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,870
1,500 yuan might be too much.

544
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,390
The extra isn't much.

545
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,670
I got paid today.

546
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,300
Sure. Dumbbell.

547
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,430
Send this to my mother tomorrow.

548
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,830
Jingshu.

549
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,830
You still need to send money back home?

550
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,300
My younger brother didn't
get into a university.

551
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,670
He wanted to start a business

552
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,060
and asked me for 50,000 yuan.

553
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,910
- How much?
- What?

554
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,200
50,000 yuan?

555
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,240
I finally persuaded him
to let me pay in installments.

556
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,080
Your younger brother
wants to start a business.

557
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,260
Why should you give him money?

558
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:28,870
That's right.

559
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:29,700
I must give him.

560
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,590
I'm the elder sister.

561
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,780
This is our family's rule.

562
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,190
The elder sister has to give?
This is so unfair to you.

563
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,220
It's all my fault.

564
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:35,950
Gosh.

565
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,720
I've not made any money
for more than a year.

566
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,980
All the pressure is on Jingshu.

567
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,060
I'm the one who is unfair to her.

568
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,390
I'm just a man who relied on a woman.

569
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,350
Dumbbell, don't say this.

570
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,500
Your priority

571
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,460
is to graduate from adult education now

572
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,840
and get your coaching certificate.

573
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,080
Once you become a private coach,

574
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,080
I'm sure you'll make more money
than me, right?

575
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,350
I'll rely on you in the future.

576
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,670
You are so nice, Jingshu.

577
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,500
I'm telling you.

578
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,830
Once I graduate,

579
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,120
I will find a job at a gym.

580
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,350
After working for two years
and gathering some customers,

581
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,110
I will establish my own gym.

582
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,830
Then, Jingshu

583
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,540
won't have to sell cars anymore.

584
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,680
Come to the gym
and become the female owner

585
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,740
while nurturing our child.

586
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,830
What?

587
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,460
Nurturing your child?

588
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:19,190
You have such a long-term plan.

589
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,080
Anyway, our goal

590
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,390
is to save enough money
to get married within a year.

591
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,540
This time next year,

592
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,120
we'll invite you to our wedding banquet.

593
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,080
Let's have a toast then.

594
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,880
- Come on.
- Come on.

595
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,150
Congratulations on your marriage.

596
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,110
Stay harmonious forever.

597
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,110
Thank you, both of you.

598
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,110
- Thank you.
- Here.

599
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,600
When are both of you getting married?

600
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,350
Us?

601
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,390
I...

602
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,110
Let's get married together.

603
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:38,920
I have the same idea.

604
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,280
- All right.
- That's the way to go.

605
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:40,720
That works.

606
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,360
Next year.

607
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:41,700
When?

608
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:42,950
February.

609
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,440
That's good.

610
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,000
I will wear the wedding dress with Daji.

611
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,590
Hold on.

612
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,500
All of you, hold on.

613
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,740
Did I agree?

614
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,950
Did I say yes?

615
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,950
Daji has something to say.

616
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,720
Didn't you say you'll only get married
after you've established your career?

617
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,780
When did I say that?

618
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,830
Just now.

619
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,500
Two hours ago when we were eating.

620
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,220
What do you think?

621
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,700
When are you two getting married?

622
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:09,870
We...

623
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,300
We plan to establish our careers first

624
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,740
before getting married.

625
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,590
Yes.

626
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,190
Zhou Shui.

627
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,190
Look.

628
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,260
Dai Daji is very pretty.

629
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,150
Not at all.

630
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,390
She's also talented.

631
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,590
She still doesn't get it
because she's still young.

632
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,780
Can you

633
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,910
get married

634
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,190
before she gets it?

635
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,390
Otherwise, when you think

636
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,630
you're a match for her,

637
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:42,980
you'll be at my age.

638
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,110
It's all nonsense.

639
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,950
It's a joyful meal today.

640
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,780
Real emotions and real stories.

641
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,020
They are all real.

642
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,830
When do you plan to get married then?

643
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,430
I haven't considered this yet.

644
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,260
We'll discuss it in the future.
There's no rush.

645
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:06,830
Tell me.

646
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,320
What else do you want? I'll work hard.

647
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,910
No. You've worked hard enough.

648
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:10,910
It's not your problem.

649
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:12,870
It's me.

650
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:13,910
I'm thinking

651
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:16,540
if there's anything
that requires me to work hard.

652
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,980
Hello, Zhaoyang.

653
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,390
Director Zhou is really talented.

654
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,870
You should know how troublesome
my boss is.

655
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,950
When Director Zhou
told my boss about the proposal,

656
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,460
we agreed to do it immediately.

657
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,630
Lai, I'm telling you.

658
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,830
You must let him stay by your side.

659
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,700
Sure. If you need anything,
just call me anytime.

660
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,220
Sure. Bye.

661
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,020
Everyone is praising you.

662
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,630
My judgment was right.

663
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,500
Thank you, Zhaoyang.

664
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,670
I will do my best.

665
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:42,980
Go back to work.

666
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,390
Daji.

667
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,460
Come here. I have something to tell you.

668
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:51,520
Sure.

669
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,110
All right.
I'll go and do the storyboard.

670
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,390
Go on.

671
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,540
Zhaoyang.

672
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,670
What are your orders?

673
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,540
It's nothing much.

674
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,540
I just want to ask

675
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,910
how you feel working at my company.

676
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:03,950
Are you happy?

677
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,910
Yes.

678
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,500
Both of us are satisfied.

679
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,830
This is the best job

680
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,300
we've worked.

681
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,280
You treat us too well.

682
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,440
Don't see me as your superior.

683
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,080
I don't see you
as my subordinate as well.

684
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,350
We are

685
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,190
all partners
who started this company together.

686
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,440
We can be frank with each other.

687
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,390
But I really don't have anything to say.

688
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:23,060
I think you are not happy
with your current situation.

689
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,910
I... I'm not.

690
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,190
I signed Zhou Shui as a director

691
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,740
but you still don't have
a clear position.

692
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:36,870
Don't you think

693
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,910
this arrangement is unfair to you?

694
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,500
I don't think it's unfair.

695
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,060
However,

696
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,950
I do feel like doing more things.

697
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,220
Zhou Shui has been telling me
that he wants to film a movie.

698
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,020
What about you?
Do you want to film a movie too?

699
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:11,950
I do.

700
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,780
Mr. Hong.

701
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,300
This is nothing serious.

702
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,740
Why do you come here on purpose?

703
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,150
We can just release a statement.

704
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,840
We've drafted the statement.

705
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,480
It'll be released
at nine tomorrow morning.

706
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,520
You just need to share it.

707
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,060
Sure. I'll do that.

708
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,390
Besides sharing the post,
you need to promise me

709
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,390
three things.

710
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,060
Go ahead.

711
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:34,700
One.

712
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,300
The statement will clearly state

713
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,830
that you and Chenxing only have
a working relationship.

714
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,700
Everything was taken out of context
by the paparazzi.

715
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,300
Find a few reputable media outlets

716
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,500
to help us share this news.

717
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,500
Sure. No problem.

718
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,220
I can still do this.

719
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,110
Two.

720
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,830
I don't care what relationship
you had with Chenxing previously

721
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,300
but from now on,

722
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,460
you will not have
any relationship with him.

723
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:02,440
He wants to break up?

724
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,040
He doesn't even have the guts
to tell me himself

725
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,500
and asked you to deliver his message?

726
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,150
Three.

727
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,780
Leave this project that he is filming.

728
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,390
You will never appear in any projects

729
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,350
related to him.

730
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,590
This request is too much.

731
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,590
Don't you understand?

732
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:30,220
Chenxing is an idol.

733
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,110
An idol cannot be in a relationship

734
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,110
let alone dating the producer of a film
that he is shooting.

735
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,460
In the future, you must

736
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,110
never be seen together.

737
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,220
Not even your names.

738
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,390
Mr. Hong.

739
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,980
I created this project alone.

740
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:56,110
From the script to investment
to getting Yuan onboard.

741
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,980
I settled everything myself.

742
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,150
This is my project.

743
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,980
I'll never give up on it.

744
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,300
I'll be blunt.

745
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,390
One of you must go

746
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,950
in this project.

747
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,260
Are you threatening me?

748
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,110
Yes.

749
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:16,950
Don't forget.

750
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,590
I'm also an investor in the film.

751
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,150
I can threaten you.

752
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,670
If he wants to leave, let him leave.

753
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,740
Mr. Hong can just pull out if he wants.

754
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,190
I don't need his money.

755
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,220
Mr. Zhang.

756
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,150
If Mr. Hong
pulls out from the investment,

757
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:38,190
it will put
other investors in doubt as well.

758
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,430
Just let all of them leave.

759
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,110
I can mortgage a few of my houses.

760
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:44,830
Dai.

761
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,110
Ignore them.

762
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,780
I have money. Don't be afraid.

763
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,260
It's not about money.

764
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,000
If Mr. Hong pulls out
from the investment,

765
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,350
Yuan will leave as well.

766
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,740
Both of them are friends.

767
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,350
Moreover, Lin Chenxing cannot leave.

768
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,700
He is a top-tier star after all.

769
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,830
This is about the company's future.

770
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,540
Then...

771
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,350
What should we do?

772
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,300
Are you leaving?

773
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,110
Why should I leave my own project?

774
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,540
I have a good idea.

775
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,260
Why don't you
just make the relationship public?

776
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,880
How can you
let that jerk take advantage?

777
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,150
Not with Lin Chenxing, of course.

778
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,630
With me. We'll be together

779
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:16,870
and kick him out.

780
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,950
He is just a buddy of yours.

781
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:20,910
What do you think?

782
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,830
You don't say.

783
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,980
It's not bad.

784
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,150
Go away.

785
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,260
Don't cause trouble, Kid.

786
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:30,980
Dai.

787
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,910
You have been too stressed recently.
Go home and rest for a few days.

788
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,950
Leave this to me.

789
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,630
Lin Chenxing,

790
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,430
right?

791
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,700
I'll find someone to deal with him.

792
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,910
Stop it.

793
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:45,020
You're always dealing with people.

794
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,670
I do have an idea.

795
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,910
Go out first.

796
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,110
Let me talk to Mr. Zhang alone.

797
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,150
Sure.

798
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:52,540
All right.

799
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,060
Let's go.

800
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,870
Mr. Hong insists on me leaving the project

801
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,500
because he is worried
about my relationship

802
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,430
with Lin Chenxing.

803
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,060
I've thought of something

804
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,460
to make him be at ease completely.

805
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,500
However,

806
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,500
I need you to help me out.

807
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,110
Have you heard?

808
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,150
Zhaoyang is participating
in the Berlin Film Festival.

809
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,220
Berlin?

810
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,300
Isn't that in Germany?

811
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,630
Yes. It's in Germany.

812
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,500
Moreover, I heard rumors

813
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,540
that Zhaoyang

814
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,110
was going
to bring someone else with him.

815
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,950
Berlin Film Festival?

816
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:32,120
Isn't this an advertising agency?

817
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,800
Why are we participating
in a film festival?

818
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,220
You know nothing.

819
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,980
Zhaoyang came from Shendu Pictures.

820
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,630
He has to return to his roots in film.

821
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,350
He is going there

822
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,590
to know more people

823
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,220
and expand our company's influence.

824
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,460
I hope Zhaoyang can bring me with him.

825
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,950
I don't care about films.

826
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,390
I just want to see a few stars.

827
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,670
You're just an accountant.

828
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,020
What are you thinking about?

829
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,780
Who is Zhaoyang bringing?

830
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,060
Do you even need to ask?
I'm sure he's bringing Zhou Shui.

831
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,040
Is that so, Zhou Shui?

832
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,680
I've been interested
in a handbag recently.

833
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,870
Can you bring it back for me?

834
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,590
Zhaoyang hasn't decided yet.

835
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,500
Take a look.

836
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,350
This watch as well.

837
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:01,830
Sure.

838
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,280
Some of them are...

839
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,640
I don't know where they sell them.

840
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,600
Zhou Shui, Daji.
Come to the meeting room with me.

841
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,590
He's calling for you.

842
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,110
Go on.

843
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,460
Remember to bring it back for us.

844
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,320
I'm going there first.

845
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,430
Don't bring handbags for them.

846
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:20,910
Do you think

847
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,500
Zhaoyang is
really bringing me to Berlin?

848
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,000
I haven't travelled abroad before.
I'm feeling a little nervous.

849
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,190
Can you be a little ambitious?

850
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:27,390
Zhou Shui.

851
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,110
Zhaoyang.

852
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,040
How's the new video?

853
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,110
It's coming along well.

854
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,910
You must submit it
before Chinese New Year.

855
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:33,910
Before Chinese New Year?

856
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,700
Isn't the Berlin Film Festival
happening during that period?

857
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,460
Yes. What about it?

858
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,110
How can I film it

859
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,220
if I'm in Europe?

860
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,500
Why are you in Europe?

861
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,760
I'm going with you
to the Berlin Film Festival.

862
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,590
You know about it?

863
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:48,950
It's like this.

864
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,220
You are the company's only director.

865
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,220
I'm sure you know
how urgent this job is.

866
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,760
There's no need for you to go there.

867
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,670
Help me out
and complete the video for me.

868
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:57,590
Daji.

869
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:58,870
Come with me this time.

870
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,830
Get prepared.

871
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,260
Give your passport to the admin

872
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,390
so your visa can be applied.

873
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,220
No. I...

874
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,350
Am I going with you?

875
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,950
What? Do you have other plans?

876
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,700
I don't.

877
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:11,870
Zhou Shui.

878
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,240
I'm leaving the video to you.

879
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:13,670
All right?

880
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:13,980
Sure.

881
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,700
Go back to work.

882
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,670
I have to talk to Daji.

883
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,880
Sure. I was halfway through the editing.

884
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,800
He seems a little stressed.

885
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,740
Have a chat with him later.

886
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,680
Don't let him overthink.

887
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,220
Daji, I'm depending on you as well.

888
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,830
You know my level of English.

889
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,980
Use your advantage, all right?

890
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,670
Are you just looking for a translator?

891
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,220
Not just a translator.

892
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,190
In every aspect,

893
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,350
including meetings...

894
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,390
Let's go and eat.

895
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:02,670
Let me finish editing this.

896
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,590
I'm not hungry. Go on without me.
I'll go and look for you later.

897
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,830
Do it later.

898
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,180
Let's go and eat first.

899
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,620
I'm not hungry.

900
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:10,950
Go ahead.

901
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,950
Go on. I'll go and find you later.

902
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:17,270
Zhaoyang told me
he asked me to go with him

903
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,980
because he thinks I'm good at English

904
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,540
so I can become his translator.

905
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:22,310
He is just trying to save money.

906
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,620
Actually, we're just going

907
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,310
to talk about business
and advertisements.

908
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:29,060
There aren't any movie projects.

909
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,920
When you make a blockbuster film
in the future

910
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,000
and we participate
in the film festival with the movie,

911
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,280
it'll make everyone proud, right?

912
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,870
Are you comforting me?

913
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,540
Yes.

914
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,460
I'm not angry.

915
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,230
I think it's a good thing
for you to go there.

916
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,960
It's the same
no matter which of us is going.

917
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,980
Why aren't you eating then?

918
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,020
I'm not hungry.

919
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,230
Moreover, I must submit this.

920
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:49,950
All right?

921
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,270
Go on. I'll look for you later.

922
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,390
Go on.

923
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,620
- All right.
- I'll be done soon.

924
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,120
I'll give you the mission
of bringing back handbags for them.

925
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,430
I won't be doing that.

926
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:10,520
Come on.

927
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,200
- It's all right.
- Let me carry it.

928
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,430
I can't let my boss do this.

929
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:14,950
It's fine.

930
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:15,750
Let me do it.

931
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,180
Daji!

932
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,310
Zhou Shui is here.

933
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,600
Let me talk to him for a while.

934
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,950
Sure. I'll get in the car first.

935
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:23,800
What are you doing?

936
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,910
Why are you here?
You didn't wear a jacket.

937
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:26,710
Here. Take this.

938
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:27,540
Do you feel cold?

939
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:27,950
No.

940
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:28,720
What is this?

941
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,360
Let's not be stingy since this is
your first time traveling abroad.

942
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,720
I took out all my salary
and changed it into Euros for you.

943
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,310
- No need.
- Go.

944
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,960
- I won't spend any money.
- It's your first time traveling.

945
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,720
We can't be stingy.

946
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,230
I'm not. I won't spend any money.

947
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:40,750
Zhaoyang, thanks.

948
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,060
Don't catch a cold. Hurry up.

949
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,800
- Buy whatever you want.
- Go back quickly.

950
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,020
All right? Treat yourself well.

951
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,460
Call me when you arrive.

952
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,020
Sure.

953
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:47,750
Safe journey.

954
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:48,880
- Bye.
- Don't worry.

955
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,500
Bye.

956
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,710
I'll call you.

957
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:00,870
Come back triumphantly!

958
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,950
It's just half a month.

959
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,830
Is he going to miss you that much?

960
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,140
That's the way he is.

961
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,230
Where is it?

962
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,310
The third car left of you.

963
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,270
Don't look. You'll be found out.

964
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,500
The SUV over there. See that?

965
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:34,180
The silver one?

966
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,460
Yes. That's the one.

967
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,350
Are there two guys inside?

968
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,310
It was them yesterday.

969
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,540
Tomorrow,

970
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,950
when Mr. Hong's statement is released,

971
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,230
we don't have to say anything.

972
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,390
This picture is the best response.

973
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,230
That day,

974
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:52,430
I did leave with Lin Chenxing

975
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,350
but I only took his car

976
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,140
to find you.

977
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,390
Don't you have a unit in that building?

978
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,830
As expected of you, Dai.

979
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:02,830
You are really smart.

980
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,270
However, I think

981
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:06,230
I still need to say something.

982
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,710
I should also release a statement.

983
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,390
No.

984
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,660
Stop it.

985
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,140
It's already a huge enough mess.

986
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:14,980
No.

987
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,430
What if those silly fans

988
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,910
call you a fickle woman?

989
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:22,180
I must speak for you.

990
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,580
I'll just say

991
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,430
that we are engaged.

992
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,790
No.

993
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,100
You are such a drama king.

994
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,620
I'll wait for the director's signal.

995
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:31,620
Sure.

996
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:33,980
Action.

997
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:40,790
Let's go.

998
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,140
Sorry, Mr. Zhang.

999
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,980
I got you involved

1000
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,620
because of my mistake.

1001
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,390
No.

1002
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,790
You didn't do anything wrong.

1003
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,180
I did.

1004
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,830
I should never have agreed to
Lin Chenxing in this movie.

1005
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,500
I will never realise

1006
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,230
that I can only choose one
between love and work.

1007
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,710
Tell me. Is this

1008
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:36,950
love or work?

1009
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,950
This is fake. We are acting.

1010
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,060
I think

1011
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,390
we can also be a real thing.

1012
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:48,950
Dai.

1013
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:49,980
Well...

1014
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,830
You've been with me for so many years.

1015
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,620
Actually,

1016
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,950
I've wanted to
be in a relationship with you.

1017
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:01,620
No.

1018
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,180
The paparazzi are taking pictures.

1019
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,580
We should give them a scoop.

1020
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:11,660
Are you crazy?

1021
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,230
We can just cheat for the camera.

1022
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,540
No one does cheating like this.

1023
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,540
You'll be exposed if you stand there.

1024
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,790
What should I do? Tell me.

1025
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,540
Do this.

1026
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,870
Sure. What next?

1027
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,660
Tilt your head to the side.

1028
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,100
Move your head sometimes.

1029
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,140
Just like this?

1030
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,240
Your hand doesn't work like this.

1031
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,020
Zhang, your hands
are in the wrong position.

1032
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,750
Haven't you
been in a relationship before?

1033
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,120
Can't you be a little more natural?

1034
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,350
Move a little.

1035
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:59,540
Cut.

1036
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:01,620
Lin Chenxing!

1037
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,020
Ms. Dai.

1038
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:04,750
Mr. Hong.

1039
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:05,920
I must have kept you waiting.

1040
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,790
It's fine.

1041
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,960
I'm so sorry.
Chenxing caught a cold suddenly.

1042
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,440
I'm sure he has caused you trouble.

1043
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,180
It's all right. I can understand.
Chenxing's health is more important.

1044
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,660
Tell him to take good care of himself.

1045
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,100
Look how tired you are.
You've lost so much weight recently.

1046
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,160
You've lost weight as well.

1047
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:19,980
I'll treat you later.

1048
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,750
No problem.

1049
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,430
Let's go. Bye.

1050
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,160
Come and visit us.

1051
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:23,500
Let's go.

1052
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,270
Seriously?

1053
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:25,980
Ms. Dai.

1054
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,950
It's over just like that?

1055
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:28,500
Yes.

1056
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,830
But he cheated.

1057
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,460
It's just a small incident.

1058
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,180
It's all over now.

1059
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,620
It was a small incident indeed.

1060
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,350
However, you dealt with it in 24 hours.

1061
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:39,950
You are indeed Ms. Daji.

1062
00:40:41,629 --> 00:40:42,629
If this project

1063
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,020
can resume,

1064
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:44,980
nothing else matters.

1065
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:47,140
Are you just going to forgive him?

1066
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,270
That won't do.

1067
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:50,830
I'm still feeling angry about it.

1068
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,980
Why should we clean up

1069
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,500
the mess he caused?

1070
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,950
This won't do.

1071
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,230
I'm angry.

1072
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,390
You're angry, right?

1073
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,660
What do you think?

1074
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,500
Do you feel better now?

1075
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,720
I'll only feel better
if I wreck them all.

1076
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:16,180
Here you go.

1077
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,620
Pervert! Rubbish!

1078
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,710
How dare you molest me?

1079
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,100
Do you know I can fight?

1080
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,230
Fine. I quit.

1081
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:45,620
What did you say?

1082
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,640
I said I'm quitting.
I'm terminating my contract.

1083
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,430
I have the right to choose, right?

1084
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,880
I'm going to divorce your father.

1085
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,910
You must be on my side this time.

1086
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,750
Both of you disgust me.

1087
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:18,910
I'm officially informing you

1088
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,270
that I am resigning! I quit!

1089
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:24,760
You're rich, so what?

1090
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,360
What's the use
of having such a big house?

1091
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,540
I'm still looking down on you.

1092
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,980
Shichahai!

1093
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,460
You're really so small!

1094
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,910
You are not an ocean at all!

1095
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,750
I want to become someone
who shines brightly!

1096
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,920
How do you feel? Are you still angry?

1097
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,060
It feels great!
