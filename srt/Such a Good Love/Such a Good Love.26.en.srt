=Episode 26=

3
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:56,580
(Spring 2025, Beijing)

4
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:05,990
So, did they ever meet again?

5
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,540
No, they didn't.

6
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,030
The girl is doing well.

7
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,350
The guy felt
there was no need to meet again.

8
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,260
Is your story real?

9
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,750
What do you think?

10
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,230
I think it's real.

11
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,100
Especially the details.

12
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,910
This story

13
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,910
is similar

14
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,420
as what we filmed

15
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,790
in Such A Good Love.

16
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,030
Am I right, Dai?

17
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,100
I didn't notice.

18
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,950
What's wrong with you, Dai?

19
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,860
Why are you so quiet today?

20
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,350
Say something.

21
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,700
We're discussing the script.

22
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,980
Ms. Dai, after listening
to the storyline,

23
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,380
is there anything
that you found regrettable?

24
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,790
You can voice out
and discuss with Mr. Zhou.

25
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,310
Mr. Zhou.

26
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,230
Ms. Dai.

27
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,030
About this story,

28
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,700
there are many things
I don't quite understand.

29
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,540
Go ahead.

30
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,700
The guy gave up ten years of love

31
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,910
just because of a movie?

32
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,660
Why?

33
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,790
Didn't they already make
a promise to each other?

34
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,140
The most important thing
in a relationship is loyalty.

35
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,750
You don't betray me,
and I don't betray you.

36
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,470
And at the end of the story,

37
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,350
the guy writes a book himself.

38
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,350
Why did he write it?

39
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,910
Was it to defend himself?

40
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,030
To repent?

41
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,700
Or, did he think that by doing this,

42
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,260
the girl would forgive him?

43
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,580
Ms. Dai, do you think

44
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,190
the girl might forgive him?

45
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,310
Impossible.

46
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,980
She wouldn't forgive him.

47
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,340
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhou.

48
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,190
We will not buy
the copyrights to this story.

49
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,070
Wait, Dai...

50
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,430
I think this story is quite good.

51
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,380
It's a love story with a bad ending.

52
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,820
No one likes a love story

53
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,220
with a bad ending.

54
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,900
Then, Ms. Zhou,

55
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,700
is it possible for you

56
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,700
to change

57
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,430
the ending of the story?

58
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,460
Let me make some assumptions.

59
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,460
For example,

60
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,730
the night the girl went to her senior

61
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,580
to help the guy get a job,

62
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,870
if the guy had been more rational

63
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,630
and didn't argue with her,

64
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,140
but went with her instead,

65
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,750
would it be a different ending?

66
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,750
Write that down.

67
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,380
Or,

68
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,630
when the girl was about to leave Beijing

69
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,150
after drinking that bottle of baijiu,

70
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,380
if the boy had been
a bit braver and stopped her,

71
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,510
would it make a different ending?

72
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,670
When they were working together,

73
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,460
if the boy had supported her

74
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,700
when she needed it,

75
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,310
would she have felt more secure?

76
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,380
When she put on her wedding dress,

77
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,700
if the boy had reached out

78
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,460
and held her hand,

79
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,310
and told her

80
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,310
"I love you" right away,

81
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,110
is it possible they'd be married by now?

82
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,110
And, during their last time in Haikou,

83
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,750
if the guy hadn't selfishly

84
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,340
chosen to shoot that movie,

85
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,310
could they still be together?

86
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,750
But, I don't think I'll change it.

87
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,750
Why not?

88
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,310
It's not that I don't want to.

89
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,510
It's just...

90
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,020
I don't feel I have
the right to change it.

91
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,900
I don't know if you two can understand.

92
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,020
I don't understand.

93
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,820
Why should the guy get forgiveness

94
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,260
just because he acts pitiful

95
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,570
and says he has no regrets?

96
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,090
Isn't that just another shameless man?

97
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,750
How is he a shameless man?

98
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,700
He didn't have an affair
and he didn't lie.

99
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,750
How is that shameless?

100
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,700
The girl gave him
ten years of her youth.

101
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,140
What did she get in the end?

102
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:53,950
It's betrayal!

103
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,950
Is this betrayal?

104
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,990
He just chose a different path.

105
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,900
He chose his dream. Is that wrong?

106
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,900
So, he abandoned his girlfriend
for his dream.

107
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,340
It's such a shameless move!

108
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,990
But, he's been repenting
for eight years.

109
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,990
Isn't that enough to be forgiven?

110
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:07,750
Fine, fine.

111
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,340
Everyone,

112
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,020
raise your left hand
if you think he's a jerk.

113
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,580
Tong Leyi, that's enough.

114
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,220
I didn't even say he was a jerk.

115
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,260
What are you yelling for?

116
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,460
I just think

117
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,870
this kind of character
will be roasted by the audience.

118
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,140
Only idol dramas have characters.

119
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,580
Novels portray people.

120
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,140
People have flaws.

121
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,510
Only characters are static

122
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,550
and perfect.

123
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,550
As long as he's human,

124
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,460
he'll make mistakes,

125
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,550
get scolded and be disliked.

126
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,580
But, he'll also grow and change.

127
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,220
That's what makes

128
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,820
a character so compelling in a film.

129
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,260
If this script is made
into a movie, it won't work.

130
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,630
The audience will think
it is not worthy of the female lead.

131
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,110
The audience will think
it is not worthy of the male lead.

132
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,460
As for whether it was worth it,

133
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,990
I can't answer that.

134
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,020
But I'd like to ask
on behalf of the couple

135
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,070
in this story,

136
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,460
do you dare?

137
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,750
Dare what?

138
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,780
Do you dare

139
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,630
to abandon everything you've planned,

140
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,190
and for the sake of love,

141
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,510
charge into an unknown world all alone?

142
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,700
Do you dare

143
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,550
to say "Yes, I do"

144
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,390
when you have nothing left?

145
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,030
Do you dare to lie
hand-in-hand on the ice

146
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,700
on a ten-below-zero night,

147
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,270
and never let go

148
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,980
even if the ice cracks?

149
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,620
Do you dare to start

150
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,580
all over again

151
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,340
after you've been separated?

152
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,070
And finally,

153
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,820
if you

154
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:23,150
ever have to choose
between love and reality,

155
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,190
do you dare

156
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,790
to risk everything

157
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,820
for love like them?

158
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,860
Honestly,

159
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,030
if you think about it,

160
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,500
all these things don't seem worth it.

161
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,220
But, does "worth it" really matter?

162
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,790
In life,

163
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:53,030
if you calculate too much,
always seeking gain and avoiding loss,

164
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,910
how much gain do you really end up with?

165
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,190
And, how much do you lose?

166
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,820
Do you think

167
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,670
you might suddenly regret it?

168
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,820
Regret not doing the things
you wanted to do,

169
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,230
not daring to love the people
you wanted to love?

170
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,950
The male and female leads in the novel

171
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,550
wasted ten years of their lives

172
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,150
on a love relationship.

173
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,390
Let's set whether it was
worth it or not aside.

174
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,910
At least they dared.

175
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,340
And, what about you?

176
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,700
Do you dare?

177
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,910
You're the Aquarius, right?

178
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,670
Alright.

179
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,070
You think I'm that easy to fool?

180
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,460
Dismiss.

181
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,340
Tong Leyi,

182
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,670
I'm telling you, don't do that again.

183
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,430
If you do it again, I'll blacklist you.

184
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,080
I'm not even in this industry anymore.

185
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,220
How are you going to do that?

186
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,790
I still have ways to deal with you.

187
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,820
You knew all along, huh?

188
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,280
You were playing tricks on me, huh?

189
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,790
I'm in Beijing now as you asked.

190
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,310
I didn't, Shui.

191
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,190
Let's go.

192
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,190
You both go ahead.

193
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:00,190
When's your book...

194
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,030
Sansan!

195
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,220
Was the aquarium fun today?

196
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,220
Why are you guys done so late?

197
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,310
I'm hungry.

198
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,790
Yeah, he's been hungry.

199
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,460
Did everything go well?

200
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,310
It went great.

201
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,860
Tidy up your clothes.

202
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,070
Is she the company leader?

203
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,980
How was the discussion?

204
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,100
Pretty well.

205
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,150
You are...

206
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,430
Your kid is already this big?

207
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,340
So cute.

208
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,430
He'll be in school soon?

209
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,270
One more year.

210
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,150
This young man...

211
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,190
I really admire.

212
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,820
Congratulations!

213
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,700
Zhang and I are getting married.

214
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:46,980
Really?

215
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,100
That's great. Congratulations!

216
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,790
Mr. Zhou,

217
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,310
I hope you don't mind.

218
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,820
I don't care whether
the novel is a bad ending or not,

219
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,790
Dai and I are definitely
having a happy ending.

220
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,620
Happy ending, right?

221
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,460
Yeah.

222
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,500
If there's nothing else, we'll head off.

223
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,620
Alright, see you soon.

224
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,390
Bye.

225
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,980
Bye!

226
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,700
Bye.

227
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,980
Tong Leyi!

228
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,500
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

229
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,620
I'm going to confess to you.

230
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,670
Confess what?

231
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,390
The exhibition starts in ten minutes!

232
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,430
Where are my photos?

233
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,430
They're all here, nothing missing.

234
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,500
Let me finish my confession first.

235
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,620
Confess what? I'm getting married!

236
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,500
You don't even like him.

237
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,100
Can't I marry someone I don't like?

238
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,580
Two people who don't like each other

239
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,910
won't have a good outcome.

240
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,340
I've been through it, I know.

241
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,670
You've been through what?

242
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,030
You're just a kid.

243
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,430
I've understood a lot during this time.

244
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,700
What did you understand?

245
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,070
Just because I don't like him,

246
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,390
so I can marry him,

247
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,500
then I can spend his money
with an easy conscience.

248
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,460
I'm good-looking,
you can spend my money too!

249
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,070
In the future, I can let you

250
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,800
spend my money with
an easy conscience too!

251
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,100
I like you, so I can't spend your money.

252
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,500
You can just spend it as you want.

253
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,790
What did you say?

254
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,950
I said help me hang this painting.

255
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:13,840
The line before that.

256
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,340
Hello.

257
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,100
To Tiananmen Square, right?

258
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:32,550
Yeah.

259
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,980
- Phone number?
- Yeah, Tiananmen.

260
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,190
3217.

261
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:35,980
321...

262
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,500
Director Zhou? Is that you?

263
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,340
Zhou Shui!

264
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,270
Scum!

265
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,310
Oh my god!

266
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,700
See that little building over there?

267
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,270
Right there.

268
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,220
That's our old place.

269
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,740
The six-floor building.

270
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:57,860
Scum,

271
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,620
so many years have passed.

272
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,860
Beijing has really changed a lot.

273
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,340
Beijing is still the same Beijing.

274
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,070
But we're no longer the same us.

275
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,580
Don't you think so?

276
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:16,980
Who's that?

277
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:19,820
No name.

278
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,490
Can you answer for me?
Put it on speaker.

279
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,340
Hello?

280
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,670
Ms. Dai, I'm Scum.

281
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,860
Yes, Scum.

282
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,550
What's up?

283
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,700
Tomorrow night,

284
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,950
I've set up a gathering

285
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,860
with a few friends
from our old rental house.

286
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,700
Who's going?

287
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,460
Who else?

288
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,950
Everyone's coming. Zhou Shui too.

289
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,670
Do you miss him?

290
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,270
I've got a meeting tomorrow.

291
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,680
I won't be going. You all have fun.

292
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,430
Zhang, what are you doing tomorrow?

293
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,460
Nothing. Why?

294
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,580
Then, help me move.

295
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,030
Where to?

296
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,860
Haven't you always wanted me
to move in with you?

297
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,700
Tomorrow. How about it?

298
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,260
Actually...

299
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,830
You don't necessarily
have to move in with me.

300
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:16,780
What do you mean?

301
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,910
You change your mind?

302
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,260
Do you still want
to eat hotpot in Beijing?

303
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,060
Didn't you get sick of it in Chongqing?

304
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,060
I'm scouting

305
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,430
the Beijing hotpot market.

306
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,260
If I get the chance,

307
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,910
I'm opening one in Beijing too.

308
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,160
I'm going to open it nationwide.

309
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,300
Make it big and strong.

310
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,020
Try it.

311
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,740
Come on!

312
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:34,910
Let's do it!

313
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,260
Let the pro review the pro.

314
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,150
Hold on.

315
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,910
Let me go first.

316
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,390
Go ahead.

317
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,910
Good technique, very professional.

318
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,460
The oil isn't hot enough.

319
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,350
And, too much broth is added.

320
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,730
It makes the flavour light and thin.

321
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,700
Also, the chilli is not right.

322
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,390
They have only Shizu Red Pepper
and Chaotian Pepper.

323
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,500
Good colour, but no aroma.

324
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,590
You're ready to be a master now.

325
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,980
If I'm ready, then you can leave now.

326
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,780
Leave?

327
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,020
Leave to where?

328
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,870
Stay here. Go find her.

329
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,350
Don't come back to Chongqing with me.

330
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,110
We've been getting along
all these years,

331
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:23,700
you think I don't know how you feel?

332
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,870
We're close, aren't we?

333
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,220
Elaborate it.

334
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,260
We've been through the

335
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,590
thick and thin together, right?

336
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,190
We're comrades.

337
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,300
Comrades?

338
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,500
That's a good one.

339
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,110
Back when we first met,

340
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,350
we had a fight.

341
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,830
If we have no fight,
we won't get to know each other.

342
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:42,830
After the fight,

343
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,190
I confessed to you on the rooftop.

344
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,060
Do you still remember that?

345
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,700
Want me to say it again today?

346
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,830
No need. Your cheesy lines

347
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,350
left an impression. No need to repeat.

348
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,190
No, I must say it again.

349
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,390
I mean it this time.

350
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,460
Director Dai,

351
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,020
this version has been revised.

352
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,950
Oh, you got some new creative twists.

353
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,300
Alright, then.

354
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,870
I should lend you a chance now.

355
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:05,590
Get ready.

356
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,910
Dai, you call action.

357
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,430
Action!

358
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,430
I'm not highly educated.

359
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,020
So, I say it directly.

360
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,190
I, Zhang Daqiang,
own five companies now.

361
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,740
Added a few more properties.

362
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,740
Changed five cars.

363
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,020
No wife. No kids.

364
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,590
You...

365
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,220
If you don't want to...

366
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,350
We don't have

367
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,830
to get married.

368
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:06,870
Zhou.

369
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,060
The day

370
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,500
we opened our hotpot restaurant,

371
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,350
I knew

372
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,780
you were going to leave.

373
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,460
I've made up my mind back then.

374
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,190
If you ever brought it up,

375
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:22,910
I'd let you go.

376
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,430
I just didn't expect

377
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,950
that after all these years,

378
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,350
you never said a word.

379
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,630
You, I,

380
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,190
and Sansan,

381
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,060
we are a family.

382
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,190
For you,

383
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,840
Sansan and I are your responsibility,

384
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:44,950
not love.

385
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,190
And, you said it yourself,

386
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,780
the most

387
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,950
important thing in life is loyalty.

388
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:57,260
You've shown me plenty of loyalty.

389
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,540
Now it's my turn to show you my loyalty.

390
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,700
Hotpot and ice jelly

391
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:10,980
are

392
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,460
a perfect match.

393
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,110
But even if they're apart,

394
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,830
they each shine in their way.

395
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,190
Hotpot and ice jelly

396
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,260
will always be good friends.

397
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,740
Still the same as before.

398
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,870
What do you mean?

399
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,780
The angle where we see that building.

400
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,740
Back when we lived here,

401
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,150
it wasn't even built yet.

402
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:19,910
Unexpectedly,

403
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,630
it was only done when we moved away.

404
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,500
Back then, we wished it would light up.

405
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,780
Now it finally lights up.

406
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,020
Hmm...

407
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,880
This place is great.

408
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:53,630
Director Zhou!

409
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,190
Scum.

410
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,090
Ms. Dai.

411
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:55,890
What are you doing?

412
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:56,630
It's been a while.

413
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,830
Why are you here so early?

414
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,540
- Daji.
- Daji.

415
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,020
Jingshu.

416
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,150
Zhou Shui.

417
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,830
- Oh my god!
- Dumbbell, long time no see!

418
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,600
It's been so long.

419
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,500
Over ten years.

420
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,590
Long time no see.

421
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,460
Vest!

422
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,190
Director Shui!

423
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,220
This is Director Zhou!

424
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,300
It's a waistcoat now.

425
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,150
Director Shui!

426
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,300
Glasses!

427
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,430
You're wearing glasses too.

428
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,190
Yeah, right.

429
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,220
Is this that shabby building
we used to live?

430
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,540
Remember back when
Director Zhou filmed a documentary

431
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,830
that made us talk about dreams?

432
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,190
Yeah.

433
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,640
We were eating watermelon.

434
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,670
Did any of them come true?

435
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,020
What's with your accent?

436
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,060
Still the same.

437
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,300
Why change it?

438
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,220
Made some progress.

439
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,460
You two are doing well,
running a game company now.

440
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,950
Not as awesome as Ms. Shen.

441
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,110
Let's gather here more often.

442
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,950
This place is too expensive.
I can't afford it.

443
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,630
It's fine. I bought it.

444
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,260
What?

445
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,020
- You?
- Let's go.

446
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,980
You bought it?

447
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,390
How impressive you are!

448
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,590
You're really something now.

449
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,700
- Let's go.
- Sit down.

450
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,260
Come on, try the food.

451
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,800
- Come on.
- I specially prepared this.

452
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,830
Why aren't you drinking?

453
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:50,950
I'm driving.

454
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,350
She doesn't like driver service.

455
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,870
I have to be on standby 24/7 now.

456
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,670
Look at Dumbbell,
such a handsome man now.

457
00:23:58,910 --> 00:23:59,700
Look.

458
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:01,700
She's about to comment
on my clothes again.

459
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,390
Look at his clothes.

460
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,870
I had them custom-made in Italy.

461
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,490
The shipping fee
cost over ten thousand.

462
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,980
He likes working out, right?

463
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,830
So, she built a gym at home.

464
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,630
So, I built

465
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,020
a gym at home

466
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,300
for him.

467
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,460
Now, he works at my company.

468
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,740
I pay him the highest salary
in the whole company.

469
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,220
Sometimes, I even make more than her.

470
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,350
Sometimes, I give him

471
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,630
more than I give myself.

472
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,590
Now, my job is just
to accompany her every day.

473
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,800
He doesn't have to do anything.

474
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,870
Just be with me every day.

475
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,220
So I have to treat him even better now.

476
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,150
Everything I have, he must have too.

477
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,740
Let's toast.

478
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,110
Come.

479
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,980
Lately, I keep

480
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,700
thinking about

481
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,110
our time in Chunzhili Residence.

482
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,060
I always feel like

483
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,670
a part of me, Shen Jingshu,

484
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,630
was left there forever.

485
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,220
Even though we can't go back,

486
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,110
I bought this building

487
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,780
as a gift to myself,

488
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,430
making it a keepsake.

489
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,190
Or rather,

490
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,110
a medal for myself.

491
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,150
Ms. Shen, you are so powerful.

492
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,190
- Great!
- Come on.

493
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,020
Cheers. Come on!

494
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,220
Let's drink, drink!

495
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,150
Come on, cheers!

496
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,700
I'm also one of her medals.

497
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,980
She keeps me close by,

498
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,190
wears me on her chest,

499
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:24,150
shows me off to everyone,

500
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,700
bragging about how perfect her life is.

501
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,350
She never really saw me as a person.

502
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,350
Jingshu,

503
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,670
you can buy a whole street,

504
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,390
buy a whole building,

505
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,110
but you can't buy a person.

506
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,430
Why not?

507
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,870
He belongs to me completely.

508
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,110
She doesn't love me.

509
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,980
She is keeping me prisoner.

510
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,780
She is taking revenge on me.

511
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,190
I am taking revenge on him.

512
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,220
Now,

513
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,060
he'll never leave me.

514
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:32,810
Jingshu.

515
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,390
Even if I have to fight the whole world,

516
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,910
I'll make sure you live a better life.

517
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:37,980
Believe me.

518
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,020
(Our bold dreams...)

519
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,870
(Some have come true.)

520
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,430
Beijing welcomes us.

521
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,500
I want to change my fate with knowledge.

522
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,780
(Some have)

523
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,590
(floated off into the city sky,)

524
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,150
(fading further and further away.)

525
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,150
(The gifts of fate)

526
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,540
(have long had a secret price tag.)

527
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,150
(The moment they priced)

528
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,910
(their own lives,)

529
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,740
(their fate)

530
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,060
(was already destined.)

531
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,390
- Daji.
- Alright.

532
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:30,740
I get to go.

533
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,390
Take care.

534
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,110
Take care.

535
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,670
Do you think the four of us
could ever go back?

536
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,740
I was so happy back then.

537
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,390
If only you and Shui

538
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,540
could be like me and Dumbbell.

539
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,780
Come drink at my hotpot place.

540
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,670
Of course.

541
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,670
Come to Chongqing when you're free.

542
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,190
Goodbye, Zhou Shui.

543
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,190
Take care.

544
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,460
Dumbbell.

545
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,500
I get to go, Daji.

546
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,020
(As far as I remember,
this was the last time)

547
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,460
(we saw Dumbbell and Jingshu.)

548
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,060
(It wasn't until years
later we found out)

549
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,190
(their story)

550
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:37,500
(concluded that night.)

551
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,630
It tastes terrible.

552
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,910
Beijing really is a food desert.

553
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,740
Yeah.

554
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,190
We were too busy drinking earlier.

555
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,780
And this meal wasn't cheap either.

556
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,630
Are you full?

557
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,500
I think...

558
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,500
I'm not. You?

559
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,390
Not really.

560
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,910
Zhang told me about
the copyright issue.

561
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,430
I know. I already signed.

562
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,020
You've been in this industry.

563
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,980
One yuan? Who are you trying to disgust?

564
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,780
No need to say it like that.

565
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,980
Just see it as compensation.

566
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:32,980
Compensation?

567
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,220
Do you think your poor novel
can compensate me?

568
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,150
You're a

569
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,670
professional film producer now.

570
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:40,980
Be professional.

571
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,390
Don't mix personal grudges in.

572
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,110
Between us, it is a personal grudge.

573
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,670
You know?

574
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,110
I just want to know

575
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,350
what exactly did I do

576
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,540
to make you hate me so much?

577
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,350
You really don't know?

578
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,110
Need me to list them one by one?

579
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,350
Then, I'm all ears.

580
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:00,910
What did I do?

581
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,150
You hogged the blanket
at night, you know?

582
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,260
And you grind your teeth in your sleep!

583
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,780
I thought there were rats on the bed.

584
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:18,860
You snored so loud,

585
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,400
how could you hear me grinding my teeth?

586
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,870
I thought I was sleeping with a pig.

587
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:22,590
You occupied

588
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,780
the bathroom every morning.

589
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,780
You're so selfish.

590
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,350
You always used my toothbrush.

591
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,220
You're selfish too!

592
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:27,980
And, you used

593
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,350
my face towel to wipe your feet!

594
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:29,910
Disgusting!

595
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:30,680
You think I couldn't

596
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,670
differentiate them?

597
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,980
One red and one blue.

598
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,430
I think you

599
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,020
used my foot towel on your face.

600
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,190
That's gross too.

601
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,540
I tell you that

602
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,910
you're such a petty person.

603
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,590
You lie nonstop!

604
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:41,870
You're panicking.

605
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:42,590
I'm not.

606
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,740
I suggest you get checked.

607
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,870
You might be menopause.

608
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,060
Oh I... Fine.

609
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,350
Eat some meat.

610
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,740
Stuff your mouth with meat.

611
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,190
Sorry, I don't eat fatty meat.

612
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,470
You always took the lean meat

613
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,780
and left the fatty parts for me.

614
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,110
You think I like it?

615
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,590
Fine, have some veggies. Grilled corn.

616
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,670
I don't like grilled corn.

617
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:57,460
I like potatoes.

618
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,590
You never cared about me.

619
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,980
You don't like grilled corn again?

620
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,500
You change your mind
every day, okay?

621
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,830
When I made that stir-fried pork,

622
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,430
you ate a lot.

623
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,780
That's because you made it.

624
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,780
Fine.

625
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,980
You're always right, okay?

626
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,830
Look at the way you eat.

627
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,020
Your hair...

628
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,220
What are you doing?

629
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,700
You hair...

630
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,110
Hands off! What are you doing?

631
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,830
Please behave.

632
00:31:33,843 --> 00:31:35,080
Don't pretend you can handle it.

633
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,927
Who says I can't handle it?

634
00:31:39,305 --> 00:31:40,970
Alright then, let me have a drink, okay?

635
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:41,930
Just let him drink.

636
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:42,950
Still want to eat here?

637
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,192
Why are you yelling?

638
00:31:44,229 --> 00:31:45,690
- So what?
- Let's go somewhere else.

639
00:31:46,374 --> 00:31:47,800
Oh, you're loud, right?

640
00:31:48,098 --> 00:31:49,290
What?

641
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,020

You're so immature.

(Will we always be together?)

665
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:17,769
(Yes.)

666
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:18,869
(I'll always be with you.)

667
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:19,850

00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:25,712
I'll go to Beijing after I graduate.

669
00:34:25,712 --> 00:34:26,963
Will you go with me?

670
00:34:36,629 --> 00:34:37,850
My name is Zhou Shui.

671
00:34:38,112 --> 00:34:39,058
I'm Dai Daji.

672
00:34:39,058 --> 00:34:42,694
On January 1st, 2008,

673
00:34:42,694 --> 00:34:45,509
we fell in love in Beijing.

674
00:35:04,934 --> 00:35:07,152
(From the moment I saw you, I knew)

675
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:08,723
(that we were destined)

676
00:35:08,723 --> 00:35:09,829
(to be together.)

677
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,709
(I just love to see)

678
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,378
(how you shine)

679
00:35:15,378 --> 00:35:17,683
(when you talk about your dreams.)

680
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,060
You idiot.

681
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,750
Beijing welcomes us!

682
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,540
(We're going to take over
Beijing and become)

683
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,890
(Director: Zhou Shui)
(the strongest Scandalous couple in this industry.)

684
00:35:35,894 --> 00:35:37,760
("Yanjiao's Fallen Angel")
(Coming to Beijing)

685
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,887
(is the best decision
I've ever made in my life.)

686
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,330
(I'll give you that kind of life.)

687
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:43,967
(If you don't let me down,)

688
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,316
(I won't let you down either.)

689
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,247
(But,)

690
00:35:47,247 --> 00:35:48,738
(if we really lived that kind of life,)

691
00:35:48,738 --> 00:35:50,061
(would we still be the same "us"?)

692
00:35:50,643 --> 00:35:51,552
Of course.

693
00:35:51,552 --> 00:35:54,505
- We'll always be us.
- Always us.

694
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,578
(I think she probably)

695
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:22,200
(couldn't hold on in love anymore.)

696
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,901
(That's why she chose to leave Beijing.)

697
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,512
(Will we get married?)

698
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,032
I just want to ask you,

699
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,510
- will you marry me?
- No, I won't.

700
00:36:30,876 --> 00:36:33,109
(I feel like we've forgotten
about our dreams)

701
00:36:34,505 --> 00:36:36,752
(and even love is mostly forgotten.)

702
00:36:37,792 --> 00:36:39,785
(What's the point of
a marriage without love?)

703
00:36:40,141 --> 00:36:40,609
The reality

704
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:43,145
is that no relationship stays
the same forever, right?

705
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,618
(I think if I can find my dreams again,)

706
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:47,618
(then I can find my love again too.)

707
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,425
(The day the girl left)

708
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:52,643
(was the day the boy's youth truly ended.)

709
00:36:53,065 --> 00:36:54,643
(From that day on,)

710
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,680
(he didn't know where he was going.)

711
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,580
I'll call you a cab.

712
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,620
No need, I've already called one.

713
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:43,980
Alright then.

714
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,870
Goodbye, Dai Daji.

715
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,430
Goodbye, Zhou Shui.

716
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,060
Zhou Shui!

717
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,270
Do you remember

718
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,710
back in 2007 in Hainan

719
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,370
when you were sending me off to Beijing,

720
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,100
I asked you a question?

721
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:55,710
Yeah, I remember.

722
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,270
I asked you,

723
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,790
if we already knew

724
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,710
we'd break up in Beijing,

725
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,910
and our love would not have an outcome,

726
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,500
would it still be worth it?

727
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,310
You didn't answer me.

728
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,230
I already answered you.

729
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,790
But, I didn't hear it.

730
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:24,910
Zhou Shui!

731
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,500
Zhou Shui!

732
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,390
Don't be scared. I...

733
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,020
I actually traveled through time.

734
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,140
I'm Dai Daji,

735
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,540
from the year 2025.

736
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,430
I came back to tell you

737
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,750
in 2025, in Beijing, we...

738
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,310
We broke up.

739
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,180
I want to ask you,

740
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,620
everything we're doing right now...

741
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,790
Is it still worth it?

742
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,620
But, we're not even together now,

743
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,060
how come we break up?

744
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,350
You're really good at acting, Daji.

745
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:53,230
I'm serious.

746
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,830
I'm Dai Daji

747
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,390
from 2025.

748
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,060
We did break up in 2025.

749
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,180
But right now, we still have time.

750
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:11,660
I just want to ask you.

751
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,830
If we're doomed
to break up in Beijing,

752
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:19,500
and if our love is destined
to have a bad end,

753
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,790
is everything we're doing now
still worth it?

754
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:33,710
See?

755
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,460
You believe me now, right?

756
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,950
My acting was pretty good, right?

757
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:38,540
Just kidding.

758
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:40,460
See you in Beijing.

759
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,660
I'll be waiting. Bye-bye.

760
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:05,660
It's worth!

761
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:18,540
(Worth)

762
