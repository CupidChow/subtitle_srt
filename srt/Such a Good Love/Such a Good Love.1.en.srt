00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,220
=Episode 1=

3
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,240
Let's leave it at here.

4
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,160
Goodbye, Dai Daji.

5
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,560
Goodbye, Zhou Shui.

6
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,720
Zhou Shui.

7
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,910
(My youth turned around
and looked at me,)

8
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,440
(as if it's bidding farewell to me.)

9
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,870
(Once again, we stand on)

10
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,840
(the crossroad of life.)

11
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,720
Do you remember

12
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,839
the question I asked you
when you were seeing me off to Beijing

13
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,470
while we were in Hainan in 2007?

14
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:36,840
I do.

15
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,030
Back then, I asked you this.

16
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,649
I said, if I knew

17
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,960
that we would break up
after I went to Beijing,

18
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,350
and that our relationship
wouldn't end well,

19
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,870
would you still think
that it's worth it?

20
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,999
(Such crossroads)

21
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,440
(often appear in our own stories.)

22
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,400
(The direction we choose)

23
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,680
(will decide the ending of our stories.)

24
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,479
(Year 2025)

25
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,359
(Year 2017)

26
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,999
(Year 2016)

27
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,119
(Year 2015)

28
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,759
(Year 2011)

29
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,559
(Year 2010)

30
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,599
(Year 2009)

31
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,719
(Year 2008)

32
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:40,079
(Year 2007)

33
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,849
(We cannot possess youth)

34
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,310
(and experience youth at the same time.)

35
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,079
(That magical hour
that still comes to mind)

36
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,840
(many years later tells our youth)

37
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,590
(that the summer is gone.)

38
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,590
(If I can travel back in time,)

39
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,590
(back to 2007,)

40
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,470
(back to the day we first met,)

41
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,470
(this time, would we
still be ourselves?)

42
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,639
(Summer 2007, Haikou University)

43
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,639
(Summer 2007, Haikou University)
Help! I'm going to die!

44
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,879
How did she get up here?

45
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,529
- Didn't the warden stop her?
- Buddy, who is she trying to kill?

46
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,879
The leader of the Student Council.

47
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,119
Did her boyfriend cheat on her?

48
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,450
Go! I support you!

49
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,679
Go!

50
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,960
All of you, shut up.

51
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,520
Who are you?

52
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,199
I'm Ren Zhuangzhuang's girlfriend.

53
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,080
- Ren Zhuangzhuang's girlfriend?
- Where is he?

54
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,169
If you're his girlfriend,

55
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,320
shouldn't you two
be on a date right now?

56
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,030
Sorry. Not me.

57
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,030
Which bed is his?

58
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:30,790
Thanks.

59
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,409
It's fine. You can proceed.

60
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:36,590
I won't bother you.

61
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,080
Today's 20th May 2007.

62
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,640
It's the 111th year and 143rd day
since the birth of cinema.

63
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,400
My name is Zhou Shui.

64
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,790
My dream is to be a director.

65
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,350
Before that,

66
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,470
my favorite thing was the cinema.

67
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,640
Until the day I met

68
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,790
Dai Daji.

69
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,320
What are you filming?

70
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,520
You.

71
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,200
Why are you filming me?

72
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,430
You look like a character from a movie.

73
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,489
That day was 20th May 2007.

74
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,079
It's the 111th year and 143rd day

75
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,430
since the birth of cinema.

76
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,430
Why am I saying that?

77
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,729
I'm Dai Daji.

78
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,759
I'm uninterested in cinema.

79
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,999
The one thing I wanted to do

80
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,590
after attending university

81
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,990
was to fall deeply in love with someone.

82
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,439
But it's been four years.

83
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,670
I didn't achieve anything at all.

84
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,430
Until the day

85
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,470
I encountered Zhou Shui
for the first time.

86
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,520
Switch it off.

87
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,240
Stop filming me.

88
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,289
You don't want to switch it off? If not, I...

89
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,670
Do you want a mask?

90
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,520
It looks great on you.

91
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,280
Take off your clothes.

92
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,839
Miss!

93
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,249
Don't you think we're too bold
for doing this in the men's dormitory?

94
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,670
And, this is a chance encounter.

95
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:34,959
This is a chance encounter!

96
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,030
Don't you think it's inappropriate?

97
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,400
They...

98
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,120
I don't see anything.

99
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,529
What's going on? Whose girlfriend she is?

100
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,310
- I wonder that too.
- Yeah.

101
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:53,050
What's going on?

102
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,520
Fine.

103
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,600
You adulterous couple!

104
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,550
You guys will pay for this!

105
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:04,839
Let's go.

106
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,070
Let's go somewhere else.

107
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,670
Miss, I think...

108
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,710
That was quite rough.

109
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,790
You see,

110
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,479
I'm a conservative person.

111
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,360
It might be hard for me
to accept this...

112
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,950
There's nothing to be upset about.

113
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,480
It's normal for such things to occur.

114
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,240
I'm not upset at all...

115
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,409
What are you doing?

116
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,199
You keep filming me with
that camera of yours.

117
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,199
I think you're like a star in a movie.
Are you free tomorrow afternoon?

118
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,409
- Can you be an actress for my short movie?
- No.

119
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,430
But why?

120
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,200
- Because you're a pervert.
- I'm not.

121
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,249
How are you not?

122
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,529
How am I a pervert?

123
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,809
You keep filming me in secret
with that camera of yours.

124
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,079
- Doesn't that make you a pervert?
- I didn't film you in secret. I'm filming movie.

125
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,329
So do people who shoot movies
have to keep their hair long

126
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:13,340
and put on facial masks every day,
like what you did?

127
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,620
I was just immersing myself
in the character with the mask.

128
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,670
You misunderstood me.

129
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,359
Miss,

130
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,520
I think we should introduce ourselves.

131
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm Zhou Shui, a junior
at the School of Film.

132
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,929
I'm Dai Daji, a senior
at the School of Economics and Trade.

133
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,240
- You're my senior? Sorry for being impolite.
- Call me Daji.

134
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,680
- Daji.
- You better be respectful.

135
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,559
Daji, what kind of music
do you listen to usually?

136
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,790
Music?

137
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,030
I have no interest in that.

138
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,769
What about novels?

139
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,790
Nope.

140
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,440
I'm sure you have
a favorite movie, right?

141
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,640
Stop asking me questions.
What kind of movie do you like?

142
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,640
Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction.

143
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,000
What is that?

144
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,529
What do you think?

145
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,670
That's quite vulgar.

146
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,790
The movie's name is Pulp Fiction.
It's not pulp at all.

147
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,880
Sorry. I haven't watched it before.

148
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,289
It's fine.

149
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:16,600
We may have different hobbies,
personalities, and characters,

150
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,409
but we can communicate through cinema

151
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,520
because cinema
is the universal emotion of humanity.

152
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,640
Emotion?

153
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,950
Do you have any?

154
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,439
You're cold-blooded.

155
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,600
What makes you say so?

156
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,640
Look at me.

157
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,529
I'm a beautiful and gentle girl.

158
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,439
I've fallen out of love.
I'm heartbroken.

159
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,409
But you?

160
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,169
You just keep showing off.

161
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,600
And, you belittle me as well.
How are you not cold-blooded?

162
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,529
Follow me.

163
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,790
Let's head to the printing shop.

164
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,049
♪Arriving at the center
of the dance floor♪

165
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,049
♪Just let it all out♪

166
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,129
♪Hey, you♪

167
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,079
♪Forget about your sorrows♪

168
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,190
Come with me.

169
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,640
Look.

170
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,129
Are you sick in the head?

171
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,129
Did you bring me here

172
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,959
so that they could
infuriate me even further?

173
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,160
Wait here.

174
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,430
What?

175
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,830
Rong,

176
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,880
put me through the PA system.

177
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,030
Sorry about this.
Guys, sorry for the interruption.

178
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,790
Today,

179
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,190
we've suddenly decided
to hold a memorial service here.

180
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,679
(Scum)

181
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,030
Who is that?

182
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,280
Our protagonist is

183
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,400
Ren Zhuangzhuang,
the leader of the Student Council.

184
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:46,360
I hereby announce that Ren Zhuangzhuang
is dead to Dai Daji.

185
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,880
Burn the offerings!

186
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:58,310
(Drama effect. Do not imitate)

187
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,479
Rest in peace.

188
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,409
Let me explain!

189
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,030
I'm serious! Don't be angry!
Let me explain!

190
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,670
(The young Zhou Shui
was like a burst of flame,)

191
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,430
(shining on me during
my last semester.)

192
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,030
(In order to repay his favor,)

193
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,550
(I agreed to one of his requests.)

194
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,000
(That is to watch his masterpiece.)

195
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,910
(Director Zhou Shui's Movie Compilation)
Daji, thank you for attending my movie screening.

196
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,030
I'll begin, then.

197
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:36,809
Listen.

198
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:40,129
If you dare to
play anything vulgar or indecent,

199
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,360
I won't let you off.

200
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,600
Who do you take me for?

201
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,550
Cinema is art.

202
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,640
There's no vulgarity in art.

203
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,830
Understood.

204
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,199
Sorry about this.

205
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,359
We're watching a movie here.

206
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,929
Please lower your volume.

207
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:55,880
Thank you.

208
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,249
Where's Zhou Shui? Show yourself!

209
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,809
- Who's looking for me?
- Where is he?

210
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,400
- I'm here.
- He's there!

211
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,640
So, you two

212
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,480
are truly having an affair.

213
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,599
Dai Daji.

214
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,679
What do you need?

215
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,649
I know you.

216
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,169
You're just trying to make me angry.

217
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:17,319
But did you know that he's sick in the head
when you chose him?

218
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,959
He always harps about directing

219
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,249
and cinema.

220
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,679
He even films people in secret.

221
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,670
No one in our university likes him.

222
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,009
He's just a freak.

223
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:25,719
He's weird.

224
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,529
Wrong.

225
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,319
You guys may think that he's weird.

226
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,000
But to me, he's cute.

227
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,430
Have you lost your mind?

228
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,009
I haven't. I suppose you've lost your mind.

229
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,809
We already broke up.
Why are you looking for me?

230
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,249
Who said we broke up?

231
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,409
- When did we break up?
- When you cheated on me.

232
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,889
I've already severed my ties with her.

233
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:43,719
That's right.

234
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,670
Dai Daji,

235
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,310
can we just be nice to each other?

236
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,790
Ren Zhuangzhuang,
do you know that you're a nuisance?

237
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,289
Can't you tell
that I'm watching a movie now?

238
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,289
Listen up!
It's not too late for you to leave!

239
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,310
Take care!

240
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,090
Dai Daji, let me ask you this.

241
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,960
Do you wish to head to Beijing
after graduating?

242
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,929
Why should I?

243
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,169
I'll return to my hometown.

244
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,599
What can you do in a fourth-tier city?

245
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,559
Beijing will hold
the Olympics next year.

246
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,459
In the next ten years,

247
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:11,720
people from all over the country
will be flocking to Beijing.

248
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,640
What can you achieve in your hometown?

249
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,310
Dai Daji,

250
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,249
you better reconcile with me
if you want to head to Beijing.

251
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,400
I can take you there.

252
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,600
I can take her there as well.

253
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,319
Who do you think you are?

254
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,679
If you take her to Beijing,
she'll be a Beijing drifter.

255
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,430
But if I take her to Beijing,
I'm just returning to my hometown.

256
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:34,910
Dai Daji,

257
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,880
this is your last chance.

258
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,310
Do you wish to head to Beijing?

259
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,360
Do you wish to catch the Olympics?

260
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,400
They're no fun.

261
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,710
Is there anything else we can do?

262
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,910
This is fun.

263
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,830
Big Brother.

264
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,160
What does that mean?

265
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,320
Dai Daji?

266
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,879
Did you hear what I said?

267
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,510
Do you want to head to Beijing?

268
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,470
I do.

269
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,879
But I won't rely on men.

270
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,160
I can head there myself.

271
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,400
By the way,

272
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,079
I have one more.

273
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,080
Ren Zhuangzhuang, do you want one?

274
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,689
You guys are too much!

275
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,249
You two...

276
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,990
- Adulterous couple.
- Adulterous couple.

277
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,689
You guys...

278
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,190
- Will pay for this.
- Will pay for this.

279
00:17:35,812 --> 00:17:39,399
♪A million miles of golden sunshine♪

280
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,349
Have you lost your mind?
You're still filming at this moment?

281
00:17:43,349 --> 00:17:45,860
This is the moment I should start filming.
It feels like a movie.

282
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,969
Dai Daji. Stop running!

283
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,119
Woman! I won't bully you!

284
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,529
Just hold Zhou Shui down!

285
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,510
Just let me kill him!

286
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,009
Why are you only trying to kill me?

287
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,879
He insists on saying that you fancy me!

288
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,600
I do fancy you.

289
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,560
Kill him!

290
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,600
They can't catch up to us.

291
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,159
Dai Daji, can you be an actress
for my short movie?

292
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,320
No.

293
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,270
But why?

294
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,639
I'm graduating soon.

295
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,639
Why should I spend time
with a young brat like you?

296
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,800
No way.

297
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,600
Fine.

298
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,360
You can help me out
after you go to Beijing, then.

299
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,559
- I'm not going to Beijing.
- Who said I was going to Beijing?

300
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,400
You said you wanted to head to Beijing.

301
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:13,809
Are you dumb?

302
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,399
I said that to infuriate
Ren Zhuangzhuang.

303
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,360
Who would go to Beijing for real?

304
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:18,910
Is that so?

305
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,230
Fine, then. I thought you were
heading there as well.

306
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,510
What do you mean?

307
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,320
Are you heading to Beijing?

308
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,289
Why do you want to go to Beijing?

309
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,800
Because I want to make movies.

310
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,809
My dream is to become
the best movie director in China.

311
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,190
But I have to go to Beijing
if I want to pursue my dream.

312
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,600
Why?

313
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,489
Because many directors and actors

314
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,729
are all based in Beijing.

315
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:40,520
The movie companies,

316
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,250
production companies, and
and post-editing companies are all in Beijing.

317
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,879
Does your family
make movies for a living?

318
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,209
My family operates a hotpot shop.

319
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,009
- If so, I'm sure your family is rich.
- No.

320
00:19:48,009 --> 00:19:50,459
A hotpot shop in a third-tier city
barely makes any profits.

321
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:52,239
If so, I'm sure you have
connections in Beijing.

322
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:54,080
I have never been to Beijing before.

323
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,820
So, you have nothing, huh.

324
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,909
We're talking about Beijing,
the capital of our country.

325
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:01,240
It has the highest population
and the highest number of talents.

326
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,140
It's also the most expensive place
in terms of living costs. It's very competitive.

327
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,360
- How are you prepared for Beijing?
- With my dream.

328
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,319
Dream?

329
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,809
Does that pay you?

330
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,249
Does it get you a job?

331
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,049
You have nothing.

332
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,359
You won't be able to survive in Beijing.

333
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,230
Daji, do you have dreams?

334
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,040
Me?

335
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,670
I don't.

336
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,400
I think you have dreams.

337
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,079
Just now, when you told Ren Zhuangzhuang

338
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,840
that you would head to Beijing without
depending on men, I thought it was cool.

339
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,600
I think that's considered a dream.

340
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,430
Is that so?

341
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,080
I...

342
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,400
I...

343
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,510
Where do you want to go
after graduating?

344
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,119
(Tomorrow at midnight,)

345
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:00,739
(the sixth major speed increase of
the railway will be officially implemented.)

346
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:04,400
(Shanghai Station and Shanghai South Station
will implement the new train schedule.)

347
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,599
(The railway department revealed
that starting from midnight tomorrow,)

348
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,319
(the railway in the Shanghai area
will operate 156 pairs of passenger trains.)

349
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,230
Hello?

350
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,160
Mom.

351
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,919
I have good news for you.

352
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,049
Beijing will hold
the Olympics next year.

353
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,919
Do you know what's that?

354
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,399
Everyone wants to head to Beijing
and make a name for themselves.

355
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,049
It makes me

356
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,209
want to go to Beijing as well.

357
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,489
In your dreams.

358
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,319
Just come back.

359
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,190
I even got you a job.

360
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,599
It's near to our house.

361
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,560
It's the best job for your course too.
You better forget about Beijing.

362
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,049
Don't even think about it.

363
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:38,230
I regretted that I agreed that
you attend university in another province.

364
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,250
You better come back
as soon as possible.

365
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,079
Listen up.

366
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,919
If you head to Beijing,
I'll break your legs.

367
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,879
Listen.

368
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,470
I won't give you a single cent!

369
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,049
Mom.

370
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:48,079
How could you do that to me?

371
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,809
How could you be so cruel?

372
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:53,560
Not only will I not give you a single cent,
but I'll also sever my ties with you!

373
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,840
Mom!

374
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,639
I don't understand the lesson
we had in the morning.

375
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,599
Daji, welcome back!

376
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,449
The world is vast,

377
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,640
and so, I've come!

378
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,209
Sorry for the offense!

379
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:07,879
You!

380
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,510
Do you believe that I'll beat you up?

381
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,770
It's fine. You can beat me up.
Just don't touch my camera.

382
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,840
Be honest with me!
Are you trying to court me?

383
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,360
No. I truly wanted
to feature you in my movie.

384
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,880
I thought that you were
the perfect female lead

385
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,880
for my film ever since
our first encounter.

386
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:29,969
Stop it.

387
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,120
Wait.

388
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,080
This is great.

389
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,560
Your back is against the light.
It feels great.

390
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,990
Stop! I'll beat you up!

391
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,190
- That's not the angle.
- Stop filming me!

392
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,270
Stop it!

393
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,239
(Haikou University)
Daji, that's enough.

394
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,840
I have enough of your running footage.

395
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,880
Daji, stop running.

396
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,800
My goodness.

397
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,080
Is this my last time enjoying the sea?

398
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:52,919
Cheers!

399
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,270
Cheers!

400
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,360
To the last sea view of my life!

401
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,840
This is great!

402
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,320
Magic hour.

403
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,710
What?

404
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,230
Magic hour.

405
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,119
What does that mean?

406
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,910
That's a movie jargon.

407
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,120
It refers

408
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,560
to the last hour before the sun sets.

409
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,820
This is the most beautiful time
of the day, when the light is at its best.

410
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,119
There will be no light

411
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,560
after this hour.

412
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,800
What's wrong?

413
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,750
I understand now.

414
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,990
The days before my graduation

415
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,800
are the magic hour of my life.

416
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,190
What does that mean?

417
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,510
After graduating,

418
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,470
I'll surely return to my hometown.

419
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,729
I might join a random unit

420
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,950
and work there for the rest of my life.

421
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,840
There will never be any more waves.

422
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:21,710
I can see through my life
with a single glance.

423
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:24,230
That's why I'm quite jealous of you.

424
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,710
Although you're weird,

425
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,879
you have an interesting life.

426
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,230
You'll head to Beijing after graduation.

427
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:33,950
Unlike me.

428
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,670
For my university days,

429
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,270
regret is the only thing I left behind.

430
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:15,670
What regret do you have, then?

431
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,040
Tell me about it.

432
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:18,880
I...

433
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:22,160
The goal I set for myself

434
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,319
was to fall deeply in love
during university.

435
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,080
It's best if my partner is a hunk.

436
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,190
I want to freely squander
my youth with style.

437
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,800
After that...

438
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:34,990
Forget it. I'll stop here.

439
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,639
What does that mean?

440
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
It's already on the tip of your tongue.
Just tell me.

441
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:41,160
I told you already.
There's nothing for me to say.

442
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,230
Come on.

443
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,809
I told you I have nothing to say.

444
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:48,839
Why not?

445
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,670
There's nothing for me to say.

446
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,639
Come on. We're good friends, aren't we?

447
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,230
I don't feel like telling you.

448
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,400
I'm begging you. Please tell me.

449
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,009
Stop that.

450
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:58,599
Tell me.

451
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,599
Don't worry.
I promise I won't tell anyone else.

452
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,840
Tell me about it.

453
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:07,430
After that, it's...

454
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,470
Is that the restroom?

455
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,910
It's very exposed.

456
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,209
- It's clear and open, right?
- Yeah.

457
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,800
That's pretty good.

458
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:14,119
If so, let me begin.

459
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:14,950
Okay.

460
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,049
Okay.

461
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,160
Bring it on.

462
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:36,489
Hello.

463
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,319
May I know

464
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,430
what are you doing?

465
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,529
I'm covering the restroom.

466
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,319
This way,

467
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,510
you can use the restroom
with peace of mind.

468
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,950
Yeah.

469
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:54,559
Say, should I thank him?

470
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,400
Or should I slap him?

471
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,710
Don't you think he's a dummy?

472
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:02,729
I'm sure you guys think

473
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:05,600
that I'm silly.

474
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,560
But I truly don't know what to do

475
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,840
under such circumstances.

476
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,289
Hello.

477
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:19,190
May I know if you intend
to cover the entire restroom?

478
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:19,919
That's right.

479
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,160
I'm trying to protect your privacy
as best as I can.

480
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,400
You're so wishy-washy.

481
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,359
You're wasting my time!

482
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,120
Why are you covering it
one piece at a time?

483
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,319
Open it!

484
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,480
You're so slow!

485
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,489
- Is this okay now?
- Yeah!

486
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:41,779
- Are there any issues now?
- No!

487
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:44,950
- Are there any other preparations? Start!
- I need to put my hand on your waist!

488
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,969
I do work out quite often.

489
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,190
I mean,

490
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,529
it feels artificial.

491
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,670
Where did you get them done?

492
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,759
(Director Zhou Shui's Movie Compilation)

493
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:07,160
Director Zhou, you were
touching your movie compilation.

494
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,159
It must be stuck.

495
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,209
It's not moving.

496
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,270
It's not stuck.

497
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:23,879
It's not?

498
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,910
Yeah.

499
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,360
Why isn't it moving, then?

500
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,589
- It's not stuck.
- I'm sure the CD player is faulty.

501
00:30:28,589 --> 00:30:30,510
That's not it.
That's how it's supposed to be.

502
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:31,919
Take a close look.

503
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,159
The turbine is still spinning.

504
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,430
Where?

505
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:39,510
Can you make something like this
with a dog?

506
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:43,600
My POV is different from a dog's.

507
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,489
If you film this with a dog's POV,

508
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:47,320
it'll be a shot from below.

509
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,840
Dogs are shorter.

510
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,400
You have a point.

511
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,289
When we gaze steadily

512
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,600
at a flag hanging down for a long time,

513
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:03,040
it will slowly begin to flutter.

514
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,360
Look.

515
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,840
Did you see that?

516
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,040
Yeah.

517
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,470
I understand now.

518
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,689
You weren't filming the clouds,

519
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,319
the sheets, the water,

520
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,840
or the trees.

521
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,600
You were filming
the passing of time, right?

522
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,720
You're the first and the only person
who understands the meaning of my movie.

523
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:53,950
Is that so?

524
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,430
(That night,)

525
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:07,400
(I actually finished his boring movies.)

526
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,400
(I didn't fall asleep.)

527
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:13,270
(And, I thought it was interesting.)

528
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,190
If we stare at a tree for a long time,

529
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,040
a pair of eyes will grow
between the leaves

530
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,910
and gaze back at us.

531
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,990
If we stare at a tall building
for a long time,

532
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,710
it'll collapse against us.

533
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,560
Why are you filming me?

534
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,840
Zhou Shui, do you know something?

535
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,560
You're glowing.

536
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,950
So,

537
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,800
guys,

538
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,040
listen up.

539
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:11,919
You guys must come back
and visit us often

540
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,710
after graduating, okay?

541
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,449
Wait!

542
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,879
Let me ask you guys something.

543
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,319
When you guys first joined
our university in 2003,

544
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,489
you guys wrote a message

545
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:27,319
for yourselves prior to graduating.

546
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,919
Do you guys still remember that?

547
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,159
Yeah.

548
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,809
They're in this box.

549
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,510
Read it out for us.

550
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,489
Yu.

551
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,079
Yes, sir.

552
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,990
Yu.

553
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,990
Yu is here.

554
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,729
Cheese!

555
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,270
I want to court the school belle!

556
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,729
Did you manage to court her, then?

557
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,400
No. He's still single.

558
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,119
Okay. Next.

559
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,360
Jie!

560
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,510
I'm going to dye my hair blonde!

561
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,400
Did you?

562
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:55,969
No.

563
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,940
The discipline teacher
caught me and shaved my head.

564
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,160
Zhuangzhuang.

565
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,839
I want to be the leader
of the Student Council

566
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,729
and be an outstanding man.

567
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:08,769
Did you?

568
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,649
Yes.

569
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:11,569
That's good.

570
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,169
I'll take my house keys with me

571
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:16,120
and enjoy my life in Beijing.

572
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,289
Dai Daji!

573
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,190
Yes, sir.

574
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,350
Go.

575
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:27,129
Why are you being shy?

576
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,399
Wait. I need to take a look.
I forgot what I wrote.

577
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,830
(I want to fall deeply in love.
It's best if it's a hunk.)

578
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,000
I...

579
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:37,920
I...

580
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:40,790
I want to be a person
who shines brightly.

581
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,879
What did you say? We can't hear you.

582
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,000
We can't hear you!

583
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,399
I want to be a person
who shines brightly!

584
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,519
Shine brightly?

585
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,609
What? Are you a light bulb?

586
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:50,649
That's so old-fashioned.

587
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,480
You must've read too many
motivating books.

588
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,649
Can you guys believe
how old-fashioned she is?

589
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:58,440
So old-fashioned!

590
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,190
How could you guys insult a woman?

591
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,270
You're the light bulb!

592
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,870
You're the old-fashioned one here!

593
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,270
Zhou Shui!

594
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,000
What are you doing here?

595
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,040
I'm here to make up for your regrets.

596
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,310
What regrets do I have?

597
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,870
Did you forget
what you told me by the sea?

598
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,520
Come on!

599
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,129
Is it wet enough?

600
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,350
Not yet!

601
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,160
Here you go!

602
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:10,480
(Now that I think about it, back then,
that reckless and young ambitious)

603
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,480
(Zhou Shui and Dai Daji)

604
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,230
(are probably the "love-struck" people
everyone mocks now.)

605
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,640
(The term wasn't invented yet in 2007.)

606
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:23,160
(In 2007,)

607
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,390
(I'd made a life-changing decision)

608
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,870
(due to how love-struck I was.)

609
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,830
It's fine. You can stop here.

610
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,920
It's okay. I'll send you to the customs.

611
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,640
Enough.

612
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,350
You should stop here.

613
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:45,190
Stop following me.

614
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,440
Stop here.

615
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,249
Leave the airport
and return to the university.

616
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,480
I'll take the flight and leave.

617
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,160
Let's turn around at the same time.

618
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,790
And, we shouldn't turn back.

619
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:10,870
Turn around.

620
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:15,879
- You mean turn around?
- Yeah.

621
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,440
- Okay.
- Let's do it together.

622
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:18,920
- Okay.
- Turn around.

623
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,190
None of us should turn back.

624
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,480
I'll be leaving now.

625
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,120
- You turned around!
- I didn't!

626
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,999
Don't do that here.

627
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,870
Zhou Shui, it's very embarrassing.

628
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,439
Zhou Shui.

629
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,120
This is the airport, you know?

630
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,750
Stop it.

631
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,609
Everyone is staring at us.

632
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:04,710
What are you afraid of?

633
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,809
- I... Who said so?
- Are you too timid to do this?

634
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:09,710
Bring it on, then!

635
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,160
- Do you want me to do it too?
- Yeah.

636
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:14,790
Bring it on, then!

637
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,310
How do I do it?

638
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,270
You...

639
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:44,830
You were pretty silly just now.

640
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,710
I should leave now.

641
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,040
You...

642
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:18,310
Don't you have anything to tell me?

643
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,270
I do.

644
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,790
If you miss anything about Haikou

645
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,649
after returning to your hometown,

646
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:30,350
you can call me.

647
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,230
I can mail the coconut candy

648
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,519
and the dried mangoes to you.

649
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,769
I miss Haikou's sea.

650
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,160
Will you mail it to me?

651
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,440
That's difficult.

652
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:42,569
If only you would come to Beijing.

653
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,870
Beijing also has its own sea.

654
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,750
You just be kidding.

655
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:47,129
Beijing is an inland city.

656
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,570
- There's no sea there.
- I'm serious.

657
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:50,600
The sea in Beijing is called Shichahai.

658
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,600
Shichahai?

659
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:55,039
Is that really a sea?

660
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,120
Of course. You can head there
if you don't believe me.

661
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,620
I'm not heading there.
How could Beijing possibly have...

662
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,689
Daji, I'll head to Beijing after graduating.

663
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,270
Are you willing to join me?

664
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,920
If we head there together,

665
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,729
we can surely dominate Beijing

666
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:26,200
and become the strongest
"adulterous couple" in the film industry.

667
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,080
Are you willing to join me?

668
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,319
Are you dumb?

669
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,769
How could we...

670
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:34,920
Are you willing to join me?

671
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,350
Let's go!

672
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:04,109
Excuse me. I want to change my ticket.
Change it to a ticket to Beijing.

673
00:41:04,109 --> 00:41:06,340
Get me the fastest one.
I want to fly right now. Thank you.

674
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,569
- Daji. Have you decided?
- I've decided to head to Beijing.

675
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:09,519
You're so cool!

676
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,319
Listen, Zhou Shui.

677
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,289
If there's no sea in Beijing,
you'll be done for.

678
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:14,750
- I'll hunt you down for the rest of my life.
- Bring it on.

679
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,089
Beijing, here I come!

680
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:20,960
Alright!

681
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,670
See you in Beijing.

682
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:23,879
I'll be leaving now.

683
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,960
Goodbye.

684
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:36,870
Zhou Shui.

685
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,479
Listen to me.

686
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,319
Don't be scared.

687
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,129
Actually,

688
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,989
I came from the year 2025.

689
00:41:42,989 --> 00:41:45,769
- So, you traveled back in time?
- That's right. I want to tell you this.

690
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:47,769
We broke up in 2025.

691
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:48,919
So,

692
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,479
was everything we did together

693
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,729
still worth it?

694
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:52,959
Daji,

695
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,439
so, we can break up even before

696
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,640
we get into a relationship, huh?

697
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,809
What are you doing? Hurry and tell me.

698
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:03,399
Daji, did you graduate from
the Central Drama Academy or something?

699
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,640
I knew you were the right person
for my movie.

700
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:10,790
I'm serious.

701
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:15,089
I did come from 2025.

702
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,960
I traveled back in time.

703
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:21,640
We did break up in 2025.

704
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,710
Now, it's not too late.

705
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,230
I want to ask you this.

706
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:33,390
If we're destined to break up
after we arrive in Beijing,

707
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:37,120
if our relationship
was never destined to be fruitful,

708
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:42,350
was everything we did still worth it?

709
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,649
Dai Daji, who's heading to Beijing,

710
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:53,040
please board the plane
at Gate 13 immediately.

711
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:00,289
Dai Daji, who's heading to Beijing,

712
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:04,160
please board the plane
at Gate 13 immediately.

713
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:20,230
(I remember Zhou Shui
has a special habit.)

714
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,670
(He'll store all of his footage)

715
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:25,920
(into the hard disc of his laptop.)

716
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:30,270
Daji, where do you plan
to go after graduating?

717
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,480
I'm heading to Beijing!

718
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,649
Really?

719
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:35,519
Yeah!

720
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,319
I'm heading to Beijing!

721
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,600
(He'll make backups of his footage)

722
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:41,710
(no matter if they're useful or not.)

723
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,040
(After that,
I developed a habit myself.)

724
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,670
(I would watch his footage every day.)

725
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:01,790
(No matter how boring
