=Episode 3=

3
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,089
Where are you?

4
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,879
Didn't you say
you would come over to help today?

5
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,590
I'm waiting for you downstairs.

6
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,470
I'm coming downstairs.

7
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,440
(eSports Hotel)
I see you. Walk forward.

8
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,560
Tong Leyi!

9
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,649
(2023, Winter)
Let me.

10
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,849
(2023, Winter, Beijing)

11
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,289
Why are there so many things?

12
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,630
I'm moving.
The exhaustion is killing me.

13
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:09,929
It's the New Year soon.

14
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,560
Why are you moving at this time?

15
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,679
It's my roommate's fault.

16
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,169
She called her boyfriend back.

17
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,809
They show their affection
in front of me every day. It's annoying.

18
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,479
Right? Only dogs will get
into relationships.

19
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,900
Those who are in relationship
should die with their whole family.

20
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,910
Tong.

21
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,870
Is this your friend?

22
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,329
My younger brother, Zihao.

23
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,889
This is my boyfriend, Yaoming.

24
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,070
Hello.

25
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,680
Hello.

26
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,560
Your brother is quite free today.

27
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,560
He said he would help us move.

28
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,350
Give him everything.

29
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,649
Leyi, you have a boyfriend?

30
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,470
- Here, Sir.
- It's long-distance.

31
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,520
It's not considered a relationship.

32
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,400
Do you really like him?

33
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,590
It doesn't matter whether I like him.

34
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,929
He isn't your average photographer.

35
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,889
He's based in Tokyo.

36
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,169
He shot five issues for Vogue this year.

37
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,209
If he can help me

38
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,239
secure an international edition cover,

39
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,190
my reputation will be boosted.

40
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,280
If you think it's worth it, then it is.

41
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,160
Why are there more stuffs?

42
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,360
- I'll leave your delivery at the door.
- Thank you.

43
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,960
What's this?

44
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,190
Why are you still here?

45
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,049
No.

46
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,560
Why do you look like you're moving
when you're back for the New Year?

47
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,470
I came back to give you a surprise.

48
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,400
I don't plan to go back to Tokyo.

49
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,239
What about your job?

50
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,609
I can work here.

51
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,750
I can see you every day.

52
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,640
We don't need to do
long-distance anymore.

53
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,400
Leyi.

54
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,790
Your boyfriend is like Zhou Shui.

55
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,310
How affectionate.

56
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,089
Who's Zhou Shui?

57
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,440
Let's break up.

58
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,679
(2007 Winter)
Today at 18:05,

59
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,209
(2007 Winter, Beijing)
our country successfully launched

60
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,439
the Chang'e-1 satellite into space

61
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,609
using Long March 3A
at the Xichang Satellite Launch Center.

62
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,960
This...

63
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,310
A handsome guy.

64
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,190
Likewise.

65
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,240
Handsome guy.

66
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:55,790
Do you live here?

67
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,200
Neighbors.

68
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,209
Didn't we agree that I'll go back
during the New Year?

69
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,999
What if I hold on a little longer?

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,070
Didn't we agree that I'll go back
during the New Year?

71
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,680
It's only a few days
until the New Year.

72
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,489
I just want to hold on a little longer.

73
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,870
So what if I can't afford to eat?

74
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,000
I just want to try again.

75
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,849
I'm already at the beach.

76
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,280
I can swim into the sea soon.

77
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,280
Why don't you get it?

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,199
Never mind. I'll stop talking.

79
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,430
Anyway, I won't go back
until the New Year.

80
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,480
(Air Transport Itinerary)
Is this the ticket your mom bought?

81
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,880
She wants me to leave tomorrow.

82
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,230
But I've thought about it.

83
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,840
I'm not leaving.

84
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,590
I want to spend
the New Year in Beijing.

85
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,230
Are you reflecting on your mistakes?

86
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,230
Dumbbell, I'm not leaving.

87
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:28,679
Why?

88
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,990
I found her.

89
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,480
I want to spend the New Year
with her in Beijing.

90
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,169
So you really became a hero?

91
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,280
Yes!

92
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,369
Didn't you say
you couldn't help her at all?

93
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,560
How are you going to
spend the New Year with her?

94
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,990
I can come for an interview anytime.

95
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,809
I'm okay with any position.

96
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:51,609
I just need...

97
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,430
Hello?

98
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,880
You...

99
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,720
Hi.

100
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,160
What are you doing?

101
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,350
No, you...

102
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,840
What are you doing?

103
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,200
You...

104
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,990
Is it for me?

105
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:46,990
Thank you.

106
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,760
It's so cute.

107
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,720
What?

108
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,230
Yes.

109
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,080
I had an interview in this building.

110
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,080
How did it go?

111
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,400
It's not bad.

112
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,470
I'm pretty good.

113
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,720
I'm great?

114
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,590
Yes.

115
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,550
Yes, I'm great.

116
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,350
No, no need to be so excited.

117
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,879
I'm not that great.

118
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,720
I...

119
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,790
I tricked you.

120
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,119
I didn't secure a job at all.

121
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,110
I failed again.

122
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,670
Why am I the only one
who can't find a job?

123
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,430
I've been in Beijing for a long time.

124
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,049
I've ran out of money now.

125
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,289
I have no savings left.

126
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,230
But I haven't found a job yet.

127
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,520
What's the matter?

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,720
Thank you.

129
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,670
Actually,

130
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,550
let me tell you the truth.

131
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,520
I...

132
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,030
I don't care that much
whether I can do it.

133
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,720
It's because I have an appointment
with someone very important

134
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,230
to meet in Beijing
during the New Year.

135
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,880
I really want to see him,

136
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,550
but I can't stay in Beijing any longer.

137
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:32,550
I might not able to see him anymore.

138
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,280
Thank you.

139
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,169
I'll go home now.

140
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,600
I'm going home.

141
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,030
I'll take good care of it.

142
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,280
Come on, I can do it.

143
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,520
Bye.

144
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,030
Zhou Shui is a filmmaker.

145
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,310
He often mentioned

146
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,000
Golden Bear,
Golden Lion, and Palme d'Or.

147
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,480
But you're a little bear.

148
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,240
I've decided.

149
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,000
From now on,
you will be called Palme d'Or.

150
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,710
Who is it?

151
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,310
It's me.

152
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,520
No, what happened to you?

153
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,120
I can't be her hero.

154
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,550
At least I can be her bear.

155
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,600
I need to learn from you.

156
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,649
It's you.

157
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,400
Why are you here?

158
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:41,679
For me?

159
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,479
(Do your best today too!)

160
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,120
You're quite good at dancing.

161
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,280
Do your best!

162
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,880
You have to do your best too.

163
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,360
It's you again.

164
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,270
(Don't be afraid!
Dawn will come after the darkness.)

165
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,070
Thank you.

166
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,030
No, why are you following me again?

167
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,520
No.

168
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,910
Don't you have your own life?

169
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,439
Where are you going?

170
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,360
Your money isn't with me. I won't...

171
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,120
You...

172
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,439
Don't hit him. You...

173
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,830
How can you hit people?

174
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,160
Director Zhou.

175
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,769
Director Zhou.

176
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,559
- Where's my money?
- Let's talk it out.

177
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,809
Give me back my money.

178
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:44,830
Where's my money?

179
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,280
Help!

180
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,160
Zhou Shui!

181
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,120
Don't move!

182
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,240
Don't run!

183
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,120
Zhou Shui!

184
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,430
Zhou Shui.

185
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,520
Zhou Shui!

186
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,360
Zhou Shui!

187
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,889
Is Zhou Shui a narcissist?

188
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,830
Emotional vampire.

189
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,889
Daji is his blood bag.

190
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,520
Obsessive–compulsive
personality disorder.

191
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,160
What does that mean?

192
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,359
Didn't Zhou Shui come to Beijing

193
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,839
to emotional blackmail Daji.

194
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,929
He's manipulating Daji,

195
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,790
sucking her energy and blood.

196
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:53,439
Are you talking about Zhou Shui

197
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,430
or Yaoming?

198
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,559
I'm different.

199
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,830
I have borderline personality disorder.
I specialize in killing narcissists.

200
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,550
Pursuing love from afar
doesn't work on me.

201
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,959
But didn't you say

202
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,400
that guy's resources
are important to you?

203
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,790
But he touched my bottom line.

204
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,559
You narcissists

205
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,559
can give up your future and work,

206
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,430
but don't say it's for me.

207
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,520
I don't even
want to be responsible for myself.

208
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,240
It's 6 PM.

209
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,160
Today is the New Year.

210
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,679
Are you looking forward
to spending the New Year's Eve with me?

211
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,719
You want to pursue me?

212
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,409
No, don't talk nonsense.

213
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,929
I don't want to pursue you.

214
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,439
I don't like a little brat like you.

215
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,480
I don't like an old lady like you.

216
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,929
There's a karaoke session
after the countdown. Are you going?

217
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,049
- Yes.
- Yes, we're definitely going.

218
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:41,959
Let's go together.

219
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,359
Here, a toast.

220
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,120
Bottoms up.

221
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,550
Hurry.

222
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,809
Here. Assist.

223
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,479
Critical hit.

224
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,640
Critical hit.

225
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,600
Here.

226
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,760
Go. Hurry.

227
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,249
- Old Chives.
- You came, Sweetie.

228
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,710
You haven't closed your stall yet?

229
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,950
What would you like to eat?

230
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,049
Why don't you make me some dumplings?

231
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,520
- One plate is about 50 grams. Eight yuan.
- Sure.

232
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,310
Old Chives.

233
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,319
Don't make the dumplings yet.

234
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,409
I ate too much at noon.

235
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,199
Can you give me a bowl of dumpling soup?

236
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,070
I just need to soothe it.

237
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:40,710
(Calling Zhou Shui)
Sorry, the number is out of service.

238
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,550
Eat it, it's free.

239
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,000
Thank you.

240
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,790
I'll see what else is left.

241
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,319
If your parents saw this,

242
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,360
they would be worry.

243
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,520
I wonder how my daughter

244
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,280
is doing outside.

245
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,400
Dear friends,

246
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,479
While Ode to the Motherland is played,

247
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,839
the New Year's bell
is about to ring.

248
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,129
Say goodbye to the past year.

249
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,809
Let us welcome

250
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,929
the ringing of the New Year's bell
with hope.

251
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,409
Ladies and gentlemen.

252
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,529
There are only ten seconds left
until the New Year.

253
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,169
Let's countdown together.

254
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,240
Ten.

255
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,640
Nine.

256
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,670
Eight.

257
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,790
Seven.

258
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,310
Six.

259
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,520
Five.

260
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,529
Four.

261
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,649
Three.

262
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,809
Two.

263
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:47,809
One!

264
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:50,600
Happy Chinese New Year!

265
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,310
Happy Chinese New Year, Dai Daji!

266
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,520
Zhou Shui!

267
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,600
I like you.

268
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,830
Let's stay in Beijing together!

269
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,280
Beijing bans the setting off of fireworks.

270
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,310
It's okay. No one will know.

271
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,040
Yes, behind you.

272
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,809
They're catching up. Run!

273
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:07,449
Go. Run!

274
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,120
- I'm talking to you. Don't run!
- Go.

275
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,079
- Don't run!
- Hurry.

276
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,880
Don't run!

277
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,360
Hurry!

278
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,600
Zhou Shui!

279
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,320
Is something wrong with you?

280
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,079
Are you out of your mind?

281
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,209
Why did you come to Beijing?

282
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,950
Are you not going to study anymore?

283
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,840
Go!

284
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,529
Be careful.

285
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,510
Daji.

286
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
Here.

287
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,080
My name is Dai Daji.

288
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,840
My name is Zhou Shui.

289
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,839
On 5 July 2007,

290
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,249
I arrived in Beijing.

291
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,689
On 22 December 2007,

292
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,209
I also arrived in Beijing.

293
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,119
Then...

294
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,729
On 1 January 2008,

295
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,079
midnight,

296
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,360
we started a relationship in Beijing!

297
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,320
- Why are you still here?
- Sorry. We didn't see anything.

298
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,079
No, Jingshu.

299
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,599
It's inappropriate

300
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,009
for you to live with Dumbbell.

301
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,840
It's okay. It's for your happiness.

302
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,270
Helping a couple be together
is better than doing good deeds.

303
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,919
No. It's really inappropriate
for you to live with Dumbbell.

304
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,840
I'll tell you the truth. The bunk beds
in their room only cost 700 yuan.

305
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,990
I can save 50 yuan. I have to thank you.

306
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,800
I see.

307
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,689
Is there really no other way?

308
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:56,559
Zhou Shui.

309
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,640
Do I really have to live with her?

310
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,969
It's indeed inappropriate

311
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,809
for you to live together.

312
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,880
- How about we forget about it?
- You don't get it.

313
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,529
I actually want to live with you.

314
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,230
Why are you so enthusiastic
in packing then?

315
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,689
Here. Be careful.

316
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:15,470
Here.

317
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,880
- Be careful.
- Perfect timing.

318
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,879
- Thank you, Jingshu.
- Zhou Shui. It's alright.

319
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,729
Dumbbell, thank you.

320
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,160
It's fine.

321
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,119
Let me take that, Jingshu.

322
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,400
(With our friends'
understanding and support,)

323
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,510
(we lived together...)

324
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,600
Zhou Shui.

325
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:30,990
Daji.

326
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,640
(Starting that night.)

327
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,910
We moved in together!

328
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,750
Well...

329
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,990
What?

330
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,729
Could you help me pull that?

331
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:01,670
Sure.

332
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,640
Thank you.

333
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,560
I think...

334
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,670
I think
we should get to know each other.

335
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,990
Hello, my name is Shen Jingshu.

336
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,750
I know.

337
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,160
My name is Liang Yalin.

338
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,800
Just call me Dumbbell.

339
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,880
I know that too.

340
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,249
(Six Months Ago)

341
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:46,870
(Six Months Ago)
Yujing Luxury Residence's deluxe room.

342
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,910
Yujing Luxury Residence?

343
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,600
Seems more like a prison to me.

344
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,640
Boss, give me a stuffed flatbread.

345
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:31,079
Hurry.

346
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:31,919
You came just in time.

347
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,969
It's the last one.

348
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:33,990
Three yuan.

349
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,599
Uncle, I want a stuffed flatbread.

350
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,119
Sorry, Sweetie.

351
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,230
It's all sold out.

352
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,049
He took the last one.

353
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,270
How about you eat it?

354
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,639
It's fine.

355
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,320
I'll buy something else. Bye.

356
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,340
(Closed Door Means It's Occupied,
Opened Door Means It's Unoccupied)

357
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,030
(Thank you)

358
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,080
Aren't you a fitness trainer?

359
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,990
Why is your hand so weak?

360
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,800
It's what I usually do.

361
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,360
Are you going out?

362
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,910
I'm going out for a while.

363
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,209
Where are you going?

364
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,990
I'm going for a morning run.

365
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,510
At 3 AM?

366
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,769
Today Old Chives didn't open his stall today.

367
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:21,159
Zhou Shui!

368
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,809
What?

369
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,009
Carry me!

370
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,120
I can't.

371
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,430
I'll choke you.

372
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,119
Okay, my turn to carry you.

373
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,919
- You want to carry me?
- What are you doing?

374
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,729
What are you doing?

375
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,430
You're exercising again, Dumbbell.

376
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:33,750
What's going on?

377
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,209
You... No.

378
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,879
- Has Jingshu gone to work?
- We...

379
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,200
Jingshu's going to work.
Are you not going back if she's not?

380
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,640
- Are you that scared of her?
- What?

381
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,169
You trained your muscles for nothing.
Don't you have any courage?

382
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:45,119
- You don't understand anything.
- We... Sure.

383
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,640
We don't understand anything.

384
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,120
Zhou Shui.

385
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,809
How cool!

386
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,430
Suddenly? Today?

387
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:54,710
Move aside.

388
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,009
Move aside.

389
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,430
It's so cool.

390
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,529
I've always wanted a dresser like this.

391
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,009
My dream has come true.

392
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,449
Let's move it back.

393
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,430
But this is something
that others don't want.

394
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,230
Others don't want it
because they don't have good taste.

395
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:10,950
I want you.

396
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:11,879
Someone, come.

397
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,969
Hurry.

398
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,049
- What is it?
- Hurry.

399
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,230
Glasses!

400
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,400
- Vest!
- It's stuck.

401
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:18,600
Hurry.

402
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,689
Hurry.

403
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,119
Where did you get it?

404
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,209
Here. Is here okay?

405
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:24,049
Sure.

406
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:24,809
It's okay here.

407
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:25,919
Thank you, Vest and Glasses.

408
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,399
- Not bad, it's good stuff.
- Thank you.

409
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:27,809
Thank you.

410
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:28,809
Okay, no problem.

411
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:29,919
- Daji, here.
- Not bad.

412
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,670
The last step.

413
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,560
Okay.

414
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,080
Daji, record it.

415
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,510
Daji's first dressing table.

416
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,159
This is the first dresser I ever owned.

417
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,689
It's still new.

418
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,800
Okay. Is it okay to put it there?

419
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,009
Leaving it here might not work.

420
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,769
I think it's in the way.

421
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:53,769
Let's move it.

422
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,800
Sure, give me a moment.

423
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,049
Hurry.

424
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:57,800
Here.

425
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:12,160
Are you okay, pretty girl?

426
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,910
Your voice is so sexy, handsome.

427
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,809
It's like we're in an idol drama.

428
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,910
- You think so?
- I like it.

429
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,750
No.

430
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,840
Woman.

431
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,400
You're playing with fire.

432
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:54,640
Man, you caught my attention.

433
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,879
(The 100 days we were together)

434
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,120
)were like in an idol drama.)

435
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,319
(In these 100 days,)

436
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,880
(time seemed to have stopped.)

437
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:06,400
(We were the only two left
in the world.)

438
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,800
(In our first month together,)

439
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,950
(we rarely left our room.)

440
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:21,809
What are you doing?

441
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,359
Are you stealing my wontons again?

442
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,600
Mr. Chives, put it on the tab.

443
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,950
Thank you, Mr. Chives.

444
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,159
You're eating my food again?

445
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,600
Shut up.

446
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,750
It smells good.

447
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,750
(In this cozy rental house,)

448
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,560
(we officially
started our life in Beijing.)

449
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,750
(Every 100 days from now on,)

450
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,400
(we will be together.)

451
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:05,910
(We will be together forever
from now on.)

452
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,009
They're so disgusting.

453
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:17,190
Aren't they
afraid of contracting Norovirus?

454
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:19,119
January to March 2008

455
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,360
(Argue, Play, Kiss, Hold Hands, Hug)
They hugged a total of 54 times,

456
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,599
held hands 87 times, and kissed 120 times.

457
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,270
Why are you recording these?

458
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,049
A new AI model
has been released recently.

459
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,289
It is said to be able to predict

460
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,599
more than 95%
of the love outcomes in the world.

461
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,670
Why don't we test Scandalous Couple?

462
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:35,640
Sure.

463
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,319
Zhou Shui and Dai Daji's relationship

464
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,689
(Break Up Before 2010)
will break up in two years.

465
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,710
How come it's only two years?

466
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,600
Didn't they say
they would be together forever?

467
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,800
Why don't we continue watching

468
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,640
and verify it?

469
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,360
Sure.

470
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,729
(2008 Spring, Beijing)
Hard work pays off.

471
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,870
(2008 Spring, Beijing)
After submitting 100 resumes,

472
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,950
In the spring of 2008,

473
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:01,839
I finally received

474
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,209
an interview notice from Beautiful's

475
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:04,319
production team.

476
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,079
Well...Hello. I'm here to apply for a job.
Where's the filming crew?

477
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,720
The filming crew is over there. Hurry up.

478
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,289
Thank you.

479
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:12,079
Hurry up and get everything ready, okay?
Director Wen is urging us.

480
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,319
Hurry up, okay?

481
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,600
The same goes for that side.

482
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,599
- Director Wen!
- Where is she?

483
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,510
The model has gastroenteritis
and can't come.

484
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:30,559
I prepared such a big place.
Yet you told me the model couldn't come.

485
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,729
The model couldn't come?

486
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,529
Where's the model?
Are you all just freeloading?

487
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:36,359
Why don't you hurry and find someone?
Find someone.

488
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,119
You hear me?

489
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,839
Okay.

490
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,320
Find someone.

491
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,910
Who are you?

492
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,159
Hello, Director Wen.
My name is Dai Daji.

493
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,289
Do you have nothing to do?
Hurry and find a model.

494
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,639
No, you may have misunderstood.
This is my first day here.

495
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,169
I'm not very familiar with this place.
I'm here for an interview.

496
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:52,529
I might be a little nervous.

497
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,769
I'm 22 years old.

498
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,559
I graduated from Haikou University.

499
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,969
How about you go to the dressing room
to catch your breath first?

500
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:58,769
Can I?

501
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:01,230
Sure. I'll find someone
to pour you a cup of tea.

502
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:02,760
That's great.

503
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,800
I'm indeed a little nervous. Drinking
a cup of tea might make me feel better.

504
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,769
Drink my foot.

505
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:08,119
Why don't you find someone for me?

506
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,360
Find someone.

507
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,600
We're about to start filming,
but we have no one to film.

508
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,800
How can I film?

509
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,120
What's the matter?

510
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,230
I think she's suitable.

511
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,470
Dai Daji, right?

512
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,529
Getting on TV. Here.
My outfit today doesn't look good.

513
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,319
- Sit down.
- Daji.

514
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,289
Are you popular?

515
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,769
No one knows you.

516
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:28,209
Go.

517
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:29,159
My mom knows me.

518
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,559
Sit down.

519
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,359
My mom watches TV every night.

520
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,359
I implore you all

521
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,079
to make me look prettier.

522
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,159
My mom will really watch it.

523
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,599
- Got it.
- My mom is a loyal viewer of Beautiful.

524
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,729
Okay, here. Go away.

525
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,950
Go away. Everyone, quiet.

526
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,430
Departments, prepare

527
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:48,729
(Beautiful)
Five, four, three, two, one!

528
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:49,800
Start!

529
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,990
Good afternoon, everyone!

530
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,009
Thank you, everyone. We all saw

531
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,319
the girl next to me

532
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,840
is

533
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,289
in a very bad state!

534
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,040
Very bad.

535
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,599
Her face is dull.

536
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,209
Her skin condition is very bad.

537
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,209
There are also acne marks.

538
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:12,289
It would be strange if her boyfriend
didn't freak out when he saw this!

539
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,289
What should we do?

540
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:16,529
Her boyfriend
is already waiting for her downstairs!

541
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,559
What?

542
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,399
This...

543
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,640
Oh my god!

544
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:20,689
Don't worry.

545
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:22,319
The same magical whitening cream

546
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,249
that Hilton uses

547
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,769
doesn't cost 998 yuan.

548
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,449
It only cost 188 yuan!

549
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:30,009
188 yuan!

550
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:32,969
She'll become fair
and beautiful in one second.

551
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:36,950
Mom, please don't watch this episode.

552
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:44,449
Director Wen.

553
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:46,159
What do you think
of my performance today?

554
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,159
Who cares?

555
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,960
Didn't you say that you would
accept me right away if I performed well?

556
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,489
When did I ever say I would accept you?
You're here to be a model.

557
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,049
We already have an intern.

558
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:54,529
No

559
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:55,249
Where's my car?

560
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,159
Why are you dawdling?

561
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,969
Right away.

562
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,119
No, today I...

563
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,510
Reach your hand out. Take it.

564
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,319
Daji, I'm back.

565
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,950
Zhou Shui, you're back.

566
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,049
What are you doing?

567
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:24,839
Incubating eggs?

568
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,270
I'm not incubating eggs.

569
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,360
Put your things down.

570
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,079
I want to show you something.

571
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,209
Come on, what is it?

572
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,289
Are you ready?

573
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,009
Yes, I am.

574
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:33,809
It's very exciting.

575
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:34,910
Come on.

576
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,049
- This is your...
- No.

577
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,800
It's this one. This one.

578
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:40,990
KFC?

579
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,840
You...

580
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,489
Why did you put something
so oily under the quilt?

581
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,950
I was afraid it would get cold,
so I kept it warm for you.

582
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,040
Why did you suddenly buy KFC?

583
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,950
I made money today.

584
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,710
What about you? How are you today?

585
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,880
Those people are weird.

586
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,319
A bunch of clueless fools.

587
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,470
They will regret it later.

588
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,119
Eat this drumstick.

589
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,560
You're more tired.

590
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,639
Have you eaten?

591
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,729
It's okay. I'm not hungry.

592
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,910
Eat it.

593
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:18,160
Daji.

594
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,640
Have we ran out of money?

595
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,600
We still have a little bit left.

596
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,839
I'm thinking whether I should

597
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,559
put the movie aside first.

598
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,449
I'll find a job
and earn some money first.

599
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:33,600
What do you think?

600
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:35,809
No, you...

601
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:36,990
What are you doing?

602
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:38,160
Let's break up.

603
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,289
Break up?

604
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:39,729
Yes.

605
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,689
Why are we breaking up out of a sudden?

606
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,729
Why do you think

607
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:45,289
I love you

608
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,430
so much?

609
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:49,559
Why you like me?

610
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:49,919
Yes.

611
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,080
Why?

612
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,360
Of course it's because

613
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,510
of my profound intellect

614
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,969
and overflowing talent.

615
00:33:58,970 --> 00:33:59,969
I will become a director

616
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,119
who makes unique films.

617
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,769
I'm going to become a director
who wins Golden Rooster, Golden Bear,

618
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:07,159
Golden Lion, and Palme d'Or.

619
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,790
Give me Palme d'Or.

620
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,870
Here.

621
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,729
I showed you my work

622
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:12,839
in the inn,

623
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,999
and you understood it.

624
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,359
At that time, I felt

625
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,520
that we were born to be together.

626
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,769
Yes!

627
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,520
I'm telling you, Zhou Shui.

628
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,600
I like you like this.

629
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,249
How?

630
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,519
I just like

631
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,919
how you glow

632
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,649
when you talk about your dreams.

633
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,390
But when you talk about money,

634
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,080
you lose your glow.

635
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,640
But I can't even buy you fried chicken

636
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,919
when you're with me.

637
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,190
How is that appropriate?

638
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:43,710
I'm telling you.

639
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,790
Money is not a problem.

640
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,839
Because we have love.

641
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,519
When there's love,

642
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,649
Sharing a piece of fried chicken

643
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:54,209
is called life and death.

644
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,479
Starving together

645
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,640
is called mutual support.

646
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,750
There's a saying called

647
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,359
love is enough to satisfy one's hunger.

648
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,670
Have you ever heard of this?

649
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,999
You're so pretentious.

650
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,480
It's indeed a little pretentious.

651
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,649
But what I want to tell you
is that money is not a problem.

652
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:12,790
Don't worry.

653
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,710
Leave it to me.

654
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,999
You have to support me.

655
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,440
I will support you.

656
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,809
No.

657
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,190
Why not?

658
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:25,350
Men who are supported by women
are losers.

659
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,569
What I'm going to say next

660
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:36,120
is very important,

661
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:38,120
so I want to put this on record.

662
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,809
I really don't know much about movies,

663
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,809
but I also know a director,

664
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:45,959
who was supported by his wife
for ten years.

665
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,919
Later, he won an Oscar.

666
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,350
What is the name of this director?

667
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:51,689
Ang Lee.

668
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:53,270
Yes, Ang Lee.

669
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,479
Dare you say that Ang Lee is a loser?

670
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,790
Dare you laugh at him
for being supported by his wife?

671
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,000
Film me.

672
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,249
I always think
that the most important thing

673
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,129
about being a girlfriend is loyalty,

674
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,439
so I won't let you down.
You mustn't let me down either.

675
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,600
Get it?

676
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,319
So Zhou Shui, you have to promise me

677
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,729
that you will only do one thing

678
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,519
from now on,

679
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,640
and that's to make movies.

680
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,830
Give it to me.

681
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,310
Do you agree or not, Zhou Shui?

682
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:37,879
You can only make movies.

683
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,230
Make movies!

684
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,670
Okay, no problem.

685
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,479
Come on, eat the fried chicken.

686
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,520
Come on.

687
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,520
I'm actually starving.

688
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:56,439
I'm going to eat it.

689
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,600
Eat it. I'm not hungry at all.

690
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,310
Yummy.

691
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,480
How is it?

692
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,350
Delicious.

693
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,520
It's good.

694
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,040
Expensive things are different.

695
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,519
(I don't want Daji to live a life)

696
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,750
(where we can't even
afford fried chicken.)

697
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:35,080
(I'll make movies,)

698
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,920
(but what matters the most now
is to make money.)

699
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,569
(After that day,)

700
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,790
(I contacted a material website.)

701
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,809
(They can pay for the videos I shot.)

702
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,670
(The price is a bit low.)

703
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,270
(I can only make
a few dozen yuan a day,)

704
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,160
(but it doesn't matter.)

705
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,670
(Every little bit counts.)

706
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:01,750
(And I can choose
what I want to shoot.)

707
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,710
What's your dream?

708
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,569
My dream

709
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:08,519
is to raise my kids

710
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,249
and send them to college.

711
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,319
My dream

712
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,080
is repair computers.

713
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,289
(The more I film, the more I realize)

714
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,089
(everyone in Beijing)

715
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:19,080
(is a good movie.)

716
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:24,440
(It tells the story of the distance
between dreams and reality.)

717
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,750
Let me film you from all angles.

718
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,879
Don't forget to show it to Jingshu.

719
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,040
Sure.

720
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,750
I told you that the lens is expensive.

721
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,649
I want...

722
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:02,609
I want to buy a pair of contact lenses,

723
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,920
but I heard people say
that they're expensive.

724
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,390
Up. Go.

725
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,319
Let's have a toast.

726
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,439
Here. Let's have a toast.

727
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,319
Here. Shui is recording.

728
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,319
Let's have a toast.

729
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,830
- Three, two, one, cheers.
- Got it.

730
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,440
I'm recording, friends.

731
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:24,790
Come on.

732
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,960
What's your dream?

733
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,959
How difficult.

734
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,919
Same question, who wants to go first?

735
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,919
Who wants to go first?

736
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,919
I know your dream is to do trade.

737
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,640
Foreign trade is just big talk.

738
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:36,359
I have...

739
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,879
I have something to say.

740
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,809
I don't get
why we can only play pirated versions

741
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,870
after playing so many games.

742
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,359
Look at Red Alert, CS, and Warcraft.

743
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,649
There are no Chinese games.

744
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,569
I asked... Am I right?

745
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:51,640
I have two things to say about this.

746
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,960
We didn't come to Beijing

747
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,769
for piracy.

748
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,249
We came to make

749
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,920
Chinese people's own games!

750
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:02,519
How determined.

751
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,039
- How ambitious.
- Good.

752
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,359
Okay, it's my turn.

753
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,289
Let me speak.

754
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:07,670
Old Chives.

755
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,080
I'll be content

756
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,289
if I can open a shop

757
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:16,999
in Beijing.

758
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,689
Become a boss.

759
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:19,879
- Open a shop and become a boss.
- Become a boss.

760
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,609
- Dong.
- Dong, what about you?

761
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:22,769
What's your dream?

762
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:25,600
My dream is to become Ultraman.

763
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,439
Dong, I'm Ultraman.

764
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,089
- Transform.
- I'm Ultraman.

765
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,089
It's my turn.

766
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:31,919
Are you ready?

767
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,249
Come on, my dream
is to become China's bodybuilder

768
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,359
and China's Schwarzenegger.

769
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,319
Take one off.

770
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,310
Show it off.

771
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,190
Flex.

772
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:41,520
Look.

773
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,129
Okay.

774
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,270
Okay, Jingshu.

775
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:48,129
I want to change my fate with knowledge.

776
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:49,399
I want to finish college

777
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,839
and study for a master's degree,

778
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,640
a doctorate, and a postdoctorate!

779
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:55,479
She reached the top.

780
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,750
Are you going to study that much?

781
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:57,670
Zhou Shui.

782
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:59,399
Zhou Shui, come here. I'll film you.

783
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,039
Okay.

784
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,769
I want to use this as the background.

785
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:02,710
Okay.

786
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,480
My dream...

787
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,729
Tell us.

788
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:08,879
Let's try again. Here.

789
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,809
There's no cut, hurry up.

790
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,519
Okay. It's okay, I can edit it.

791
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,729
My dream...

792
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:14,270
Don't bother me.

793
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,249
My dream is to become China's

794
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,000
greatest director!

795
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,830
I have one more dream.

796
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,190
Be with Daji forever.

797
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,609
Director Shui.

798
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,560
China's Top, Director Shui.

799
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:29,399
Daji.

800
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,249
Go ahead.

801
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,790
My dream

802
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,000
is to become a rich woman!

803
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,519
What are you laughing at?

804
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,569
I'm serious. I'm telling you.

805
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:39,999
I want to become
the richest woman in Beijing

806
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,959
and support

807
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,270
China's greatest director.

808
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,039
It's me.

809
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,289
Okay.

810
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:52,129
Here. Let's shoot a small compilation.
Let's film one together.

811
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:54,800
Let's count three, two, one
and say "Beijing welcomes us", okay?

812
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,519
- Okay!
- Here.

813
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,399
Three, two, one.

814
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,160
Beijing welcomes us!

815
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:04,670
Did you get it?

816
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,670
Did you get it yet?

817
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,870
(Our bold words)

818
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,040
(drifted above Beijing's skies,)

819
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:17,120
(so distant and unreachable.)

820
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,000
(18 years later,)

821
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,640
(when we reunite here,)

822
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,190
(Old Chives is already gone.)

823
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,089
(Glasses and Vest)

824
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:30,520
(started their own game company.)

825
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:33,640
(This rooftop...)

826
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,230
(No.)

827
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,080
(This whole building)

828
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,960
(has been bought by Jingshu.)

829
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,560
(Dumbbell really married Shen Jingshu.)

830
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:48,640
(When the gears of fate began to turn,)

831
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,230
(everything becomes inevitable.)

832
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,670
