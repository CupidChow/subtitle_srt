=Such A Good Love=

00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,220
=Episode 21=

3
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,380
(Summer 2012, Beijing)

4
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,510
- Dumbbell is worthless.
- Jingshu is worthless.

5
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,460
Why is Dumbbell worthless?

6
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,260
How is Jingshu worthless?

7
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,260
Jingshu ran away with a rich guy.

8
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,540
Isn't she just a gold-digger?

9
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,230
Dumbbell collected a million

10
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,750
and sold his girlfriend for it.

11
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,140
Is he a good man?

12
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,420
OK, they are both trash.

13
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,470
Why did things turn out this way?

14
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,230
We won't become like them, right?

15
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,260
From now on,

16
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,350
I want to make money.

17
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,790
I want to keep making money.

18
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,580
How much do you want to earn?

19
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,860
I want to have enough
that we can live with dignity.

20
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,540
I want us to have enough to be confident

21
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,030
so that we won't become like them.

22
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,260
Get rich, make a fortune.

23
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,100
Let's get rich.

24
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,380
Let's make a million.

25
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,660
How do we make it?

26
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,660
Whatever Zhaoyang is doing,

27
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,310
we will do it.

28
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,910
Make your move.

29
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,470
The marketing manager
of Fireworks Media,

30
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,950
100 thousand per ad.

31
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,030
The director of Triumph Tourism.

32
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,660
Each travel advertisement costs
10 thousand.

33
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,070
Watch out.

34
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,070
The advertising director of Aohua

35
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,630
and his five minions.

36
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,100
Good cards, but I have

37
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,470
the director of Huge Rock Culture.

38
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,040
They need to make music videos for the
dozens of young idols under their name.

39
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,350
Mr. Zhou, you're experienced.

40
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:06,980
Not at all.

41
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,100
Since that's the case,

42
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,510
Huayi Sisters.

43
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,510
The trump card.

44
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,190
It's my loss.

45
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:35,310
(Dai Daji)

46
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,460
Hello.

47
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,020
I'm the CEO of
Extraordinary Culture Media,

48
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,430
Dai Daji.

49
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,900
How should I refer you?

50
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,820
I'm a contracted director under
Extraordinary Culture,

51
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,820
Zhou Shui.

52
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,950
Director Zhou.

53
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,020
- Director Zhou.
- Ms. Dai.

54
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,780
I didn't expect

55
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,820
myself to be the only employee
in such a big company.

56
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,310
Do you have a problem with that?

57
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,950
No problem, boss!

58
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,750
Work hard, my staff!

59
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,190
(In 2012,)

60
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,580
(Zhou Shui and I)

61
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,870
(moved back to place
beside the CCTV building.)

62
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,840
(Extraordinary Culture)

63
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,380
(Under my glorious leadership,)

64
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,430
(Extraordinary Culture Media)

65
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,190
(has been in the scene for three years.)

66
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,140
(Commercial Advertisement Contract)

67
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,110
This is our first contract.

68
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:14,700
That's right.

69
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,920
If there is a first,
there will be a second.

70
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,140
We're going to get a house and a car.

71
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,820
A house and a car!

72
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,220
We're going to be rich!

73
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,060
(Summer 2016, Beijing)

74
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,510
I know.

75
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,670
Our filming is completed for sure.

76
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,580
Shouldn't you settle

77
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,950
the final payment?

78
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,990
You've been on the phone all the way.

79
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,580
Okay, I got it.

80
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,340
Understood.

81
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll get back to you later.
I have to go.

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,760
Your mother is here

83
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,550
and you can't even accompany her
for a moment?

84
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,760
You didn't say a single word to me.
Always on your phone.

85
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,630
How did I not accompany you?
Am I not here?

86
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,190
Walk quickly.

87
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,950
I'm talking about Zhou Shui.
His mother-in-law is here in Beijing.

88
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,140
Did he care about me?

89
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,190
Three strikes and he's out.
He has missed his appearance twice.

90
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,310
Figure it out yourself.

91
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,260
Okay.

92
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,780
You're both busy all the time.

93
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,870
Your eyes are full of money

94
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,340
but I don't see you making a penny.

95
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,460
Where's the money?
Have you got me money yet?

96
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:13,750
What's this?

97
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,990
What's this? My car.

98
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,380
Mercedes?

99
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,340
Mercedes.

100
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,700
You bought it?

101
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,520
Of course.

102
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,580
You rented it, didn't you?

103
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,340
I bought it in full.

104
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,510
Oh my God.

105
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,750
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Did you really buy it?

106
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,870
I bought it.

107
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,700
You're good.

108
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,000
Mrs. Dai. Hi, Mrs. Dai.

109
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,580
Hi, Mrs. Dai.

110
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,600
Zhou Shui.

111
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,670
Mrs. Dai, please come in.

112
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,550
Long time no see.

113
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,430
Long time no see.

114
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,820
Come on, let me handle the luggage.

115
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,510
Should I change my shoes?

116
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,360
No, it's fine.

117
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,220
Someone will come to clean up
in the afternoon.

118
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,200
Yes, we hired a cleaner.

119
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,140
Welcome, Mrs. Dai. Come in, please.

120
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,670
It looks really nice.

121
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,000
Right?

122
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,670
After not seeing you for some time,
you've become better at talking.

123
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,870
All these skills were
honed from buttering up clients.

124
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,190
Large floor-to-ceiling windows.
Great view.

125
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,950
Right in the city ​​center.

126
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,870
High floor, how does it look?

127
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,580
Very good. It must be expensive, right?

128
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,630
Is it expensive?

129
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,020
To our Director Zhou, it's just...

130
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,820
It's nothing.

131
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,020
Nothing much.

132
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,430
Buy whatever you want.

133
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,920
Okay?

134
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,440
Yes, just shop as you please, Mrs. Dai.

135
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,920
You've really made a fortune, huh?

136
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,070
No, not really.
Anyway, we can afford these things.

137
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,140
Shui will pay the bill.

138
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,190
I'll pay the bill.

139
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,430
Isn't it expensive in the mall?

140
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,000
- It's okay.
- Shall we have a look there?

141
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,190
Look.

142
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,630
No, it's too expensive.

143
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,820
It's okay, just take a look.

144
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:35,880
This one.

145
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,670
Isn't it beautiful?

146
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,820
It's gorgeous.

147
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,880
Let's take a look inside, Mrs. Dai.
It's okay, there are handbags in there.

148
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,820
Hold on, Zhou Shui.

149
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,990
I forgot that we have a conference call
this afternoon.

150
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,080
Did you forget too?

151
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,950
Yes. We need to have
a phone call with Mr. Li.

152
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:48,510
Yes.

153
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,760
Let's leave then.

154
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,430
- You just go shopping.
- Just wait for us.

155
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,260
- Wait for us.
- Yeah.

156
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,600
We'll be back right after the call.

157
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,800
- Just a minute, Mrs. Dai.
- Yes.

158
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,760
Okay, you guys get busy.

159
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,020
Go on.

160
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,780
Mr. Li.

161
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,340
I'm sorry.

162
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,900
Excuse me. This is our exhibit.
Please do not touch it with your hands.

163
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,700
I just want to see what material it is.

164
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,630
This is a lambskin handbag.

165
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,780
It's 30 thousand.

166
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:17,700
How much?

167
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,430
30 thousand.

168
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,580
30...

169
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,670
This bag looks pretty nice.

170
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,670
Of course, it's so expensive.

171
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,700
Bag it up.

172
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,070
Miss, you have a really good taste.
I'll pack it up right away.

173
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,990
I don't want it.

174
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,070
I've just touched it once.

175
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,560
You can't just force a deal like this!

176
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,270
Mrs. Dai, consider it a gift.

177
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,550
I've tasted so many meals you made.

178
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,270
This is my thank-you gift to you.

179
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,620
Oh, you are...

180
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,620
Jingshu.

181
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,030
It really is you.

182
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,270
I've got 58 likes on this post.

183
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,220
That's great.

184
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:02,440
Nice.

185
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,160
Zhou Shui.
Take a few more photos for me here.

186
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,910
- Jingshu.
- Okay.

187
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,670
Let's add each other on WeChat.

188
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,310
Yes.

189
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,390
I have stopped using my QQ
for a long time now.

190
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,150
I'll scan yours.

191
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,620
Okay.

192
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,440
Jiji.

193
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,560
- Alright, here we go.
- Okay.

194
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,880
We're in touch now.

195
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,390
(Movie poet, Tarkovsky.)
So beautiful.

196
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,580
Wow, Daji.

197
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,270
You're a total career woman now.

198
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,980
Not really. I'm just
promoting my company.

199
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,700
Maintaining our image.

200
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,640
What are you doing?
I won't take your money.

201
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,430
No, you have to take the money
for the handbag.

202
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,840
No way.

203
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,400
- Jingshu.
- Seriously. This...

204
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:34,670
Just accept it.

205
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,220
I can still afford a handbag.

206
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,100
It's not about the money, come on.

207
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,820
This is my gift to Mrs. Dai.

208
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,150
I should be the one gifting her.

209
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,740
Why are you two so distant from me?

210
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,340
Do you guys dislike my money?

211
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,340
Jingshu.

212
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,190
I've finished taking pictures

213
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,620
and flaunting it.

214
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,550
This handbag...

215
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,670
Mrs. Dai, this is a gift to you.

216
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,340
I've eaten so many meals that you cooked.

217
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,160
Are you kidding me?

218
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,950
How can those meals
be worth 30 thousand yuan?

219
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,760
How can I make such expensive meals?

220
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,360
30 thousand yuan is just a small amount.

221
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,550
Jingshu, please accept it.

222
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,190
All right.

223
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,100
Jingshu, how did you come today?
We drove here, we can give you a ride.

224
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,430
No, my ride is here.

225
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,190
I'll take my leave then.

226
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,340
Bye-Bye.

227
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,460
Bye-Bye.

228
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,910
Daji, let's meet up soon.

229
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,310
Bye, Mrs. Dai.

230
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:27,910
Bye, Shui.

231
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,620
Bye-Bye.

232
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,700
What's wrong?

233
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,460
Is her car very expensive?

234
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,980
It's only ten times more expensive
than our car.

235
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,820
About that.

236
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,680
- What?
- Let's go.

237
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,200
- Let's go home.
- Don't think about it.

238
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,580
Let's go.

239
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,790
Thank you for your hard work.

240
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,460
What do you mean?

241
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,070
These few days,

242
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,030
you've been trying to make my mom happy
in different ways.

243
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,860
This is just the beginning.

244
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,580
I promised your mother that
I would make you happy.

245
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,700
We're going to be happier and happier.

246
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,200
That way, your mother will also
become happier.

247
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,860
What about you? Are you happy?

248
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,980
I'm happy.

249
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,790
I will be happy if you are happy.

250
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,620
I'm very happy.

251
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,910
Working overtime.

252
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:32,980
Overtime!

253
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,100
Hey, goddess.
What are you looking at there?

254
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,910
What's so good about this flower?

255
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,270
- Sleep now. What time is it?
- I'm happy.

256
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,580
Are you happy?

257
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,670
How are you doing today?
You look very happy.

258
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,310
Didn't I tell you?

259
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,220
Poor couples are sad.

260
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,550
He's making money now.

261
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,120
You two don't even argue anymore,
do you?

262
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,500
Yes.

263
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,070
Then can you stop worrying now?

264
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,030
He fulfilled all his promises.

265
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:20,980
Not yet.

266
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,270
Why do you say so?

267
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,190
Mom,

268
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,190
You went shopping from Wangfujing
to Tongzhou.

269
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,580
I can't believe I fell for your trick.

270
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,190
It's on the way.

271
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,550
There are drinks and
air conditioning in here.

272
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,600
It's better than getting scorched
by the sun outside.

273
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,790
Yes, let's take a look here.

274
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,030
This is our sky garden.

275
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,670
Look.

276
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,460
At the top.

277
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,430
Overlooking the entire Tonghui River.

278
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,390
Open the door and you will see
the river view.

279
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,240
It's nice to live by the river,
the air is good.

280
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,680
Am I right?

281
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,820
Yes, Mrs. Dai, look.

282
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,000
Houses like this are really rare
in Beijing nowadays.

283
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,080
There are high schools
and elementary schools nearby.

284
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,520
The subway is about to go through here,
it's absolutely worth it.

285
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,640
You have to think long-term.

286
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,310
You will live in a house
for 30 or 40 years.

287
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,620
Yes.

288
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,980
How much is the house?

289
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,740
Mrs. Dai is interested in
the two-bedroom.

290
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,340
Four and a half million, special price.

291
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,460
Is this your first apartment?

292
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,310
You can get a lower down payment.

293
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,980
About 1.5 million.

294
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,390
Just 1.5 million.

295
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,070
Okay, we understand.

296
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:19,920
Thank you. Let's go.

297
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,240
You have to seize the opportunity.

298
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,840
Tongzhou has
no purchase restrictions yet.

299
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,000
Many people from other districts
are buying houses here.

300
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,220
Okay.

301
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,240
- Hey... Call me.
- Let's go back and consider. Thanks.

302
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,220
Okay, thanks.

303
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,500
Did you hear that?

304
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,340
Zhou Shui, listen up.

305
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,400
Others are rushing to buy.

306
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,440
If you don't buy it now,
there will be no chance soon.

307
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,270
Do you get a commission
when I buy the house?

308
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:38,950
No.

309
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,030
Mrs. Dai, she's joking.

310
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,500
1.5 million down payment.

311
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,950
We can't even afford a fraction of it.

312
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,270
Zhou Shui is making money now.

313
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,070
Shouldn't you two settle down?

314
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:46,790
Yes.

315
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,600
He is making money.

316
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,070
It's not like we won the lottery.
How rich do you think we are?

317
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:50,960
It's just 1.5 million.

318
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,340
You are driving such an expensive car
every day,

319
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,550
renting that house for tens of thousands
every month.

320
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,950
You buy a handbag without blinking

321
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,270
and wear such expensive clothes.

322
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,220
We are just starting our business.
We have to at least build up an image.

323
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,070
If we don't even have a car
who would trust us?

324
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,910
The reality is we can't afford it.

325
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:05,500
Okay.

326
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,950
You are right anyway.

327
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,150
Okay, let me tell you.

328
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,670
I want this house anyway.
I will buy it no matter what.

329
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,310
Zhou Shui, notify your parents to
come to Beijing this week.

330
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,500
Let's discuss

331
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,670
how to buy this house.

332
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:20,150
(Transaction volume of newly built
commercial housing in Beijing)

333
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,390
(increased by 24.56% in 2016.)

334
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,440
She wants to skip us
and discuss parent-to-parent.

335
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,460
So...

336
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,310
Should I call my parents?

337
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:31,910
I don't know.

338
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,620
(The average transaction price
is 32,592 yuan per square meter.)

339
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,390
(An increase of 20.33%.)

340
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,060
(Autumn 2024, Beijing)
In this year of 2024,

341
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,065
the average listing price

342
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:47,550
of second-hand houses in Beijing
has fallen by more than 17%,

343
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,160
but the transaction volume by
the end of the year has gone up.

344
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,320
Prices have also stabilized.

345
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,460
It's really wise for both of you
to buy a house now.

346
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,310
I entered the industry in 2016.

347
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,500
The first house I sold

348
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,790
is in this community.

349
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,460
Look.

350
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,500
These were all construction sites.

351
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,550
Now we have a complete community.

352
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,580
How much per square meter
did you sell that house back in 2016?

353
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,440
At that time, the market just opened
and it was only 30 thousand yuan.

354
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,150
30 thousand to 80 thousand.

355
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,150
Those who bought houses at that time
must have made a lot of money.

356
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,620
Of course, that's normal.

357
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,740
Those who purchased houses then
are worth tens of millions now.

358
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,620
Tax, 3.6 million.

359
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,740
Down payment, taxes, agency fees.

360
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,670
A total of 3.96 million.

361
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,670
396.

362
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,910
396.

363
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,500
Tong Leyi. It's really you.

364
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,270
Ms. Dai.

365
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,740
Why are you here?

366
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,670
I'm meeting up with a friend here.

367
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,220
I'm early.

368
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,500
Take a seat.

369
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,160
You can sit here.

370
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,670
Waiter, a glass of warm water, please.

371
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,640
This is my boss, Ms. Dai.

372
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,790
What are you talking about?

373
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,580
Yun City Hua Mansion?

374
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,220
Do you know this community?

375
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,220
I know.

376
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,700
It's an old community.

377
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,700
It's okay, keep going.

378
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,560
Don't worry about me.

379
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,950
Then we will ignore you.

380
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,100
Don't worry about me.

381
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,670
3.69 million.

382
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,150
Then, we split it in half each.

383
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,030
Okay, we each pay half of it.

384
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,820
You will pay for the renovation.

385
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,500
You will also pay for the parking space
because the car is yours.

386
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,800
Should I pay for the parking fee?

387
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,500
But you drive that car, too.

388
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,270
The car is yours.

389
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,310
True, but don't you drive it to work
as well?

390
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,550
Okay, sure, fine.

391
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,150
I'll bear it.

392
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,620
You have the ownership over it.

393
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,980
True.

394
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,800
Since we are done with the down payment,
let's talk about the loan.

395
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,700
Let's split it in half.

396
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,030
That won't work.

397
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,270
We should split it according to
our income ratio.

398
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,950
20-80. I pay 20%, you pay 80%.

399
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,430
But your income is pretty high too.

400
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,270
Not as high as yours.

401
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,270
How about this,

402
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,320
let's not do 20-80.
It doesn't sound good.

403
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,740
Why don't we do 30-70?
You pay 30%, I pay 70%.

404
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,910
Sure.

405
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,310
Okay.

406
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,670
The next item is the wedding.

407
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,500
Wedding.

408
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,070
Next item.

409
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:46,700
Hold on.

410
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,310
Let me answer a call.

411
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,100
Okay.

412
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,550
We're so busy.

413
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,190
Are you guys

414
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,070
going to get married?

415
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,270
Who is this?

416
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,910
I've never heard you talk about him.

417
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,700
His name is Yaoming.

418
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,150
Back in Tokyo,

419
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,920
he was a photographer for
many magazines.

420
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,300
Previously, he wanted us to
move in together, so I dumped him.

421
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,430
I didn't expect him to become so mature

422
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,980
after a year.

423
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,670
We don't care about
the lovey-dovey things anymore.

424
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,430
You guys sounded like

425
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,460
you were talking business.

426
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,950
Where there is emotion,
there is business.

427
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,260
If you can treat a relationship
like a business,

428
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,590
it means

429
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,300
you don't love this person at all.

430
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,840
I haven't thought about it this way.

431
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,500
Sure.

432
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,670
I'm going to my meeting.

433
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,390
Since you are getting married,

434
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:55,110
I think there are some things
you should think about first, okay?

435
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,190
Give it some thought,
it's not that urgent.

436
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,390
Okay, I got to go.

437
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,870
See you.

438
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,300
Give it some thought.

439
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,150
(Down payment, decoration, parking fee,
mortgage, marriage budget, wedding)

440
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,680
Don't make it sound like a negotiation.

441
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,500
Let's

442
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,300
finish this meal with a pleasant look.

443
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,350
Why can't we negotiate?

444
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,670
As a girl,
can't you have some more confidence?

445
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,630
How can you negotiate
the first time you meet?

446
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,840
Let's first finish this meal...

447
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,060
Mrs. Dao, Daji.

448
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,460
- Zhou Shui.
- My Dad is here.

449
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,260
Mr. Zhou.

450
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:23,830
Hello, Daji.

451
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,350
You look so young.

452
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,910
Nice to meet you.

453
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,700
- We've finally met.
- Finally.

454
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,300
Mrs. Dai.

455
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,460
This is my mother.

456
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,220
Mrs. Dai.

457
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:31,910
Take a seat.

458
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,910
Why? Did you bring gifts?

459
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,460
Yes, I brought some local specialties.

460
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,540
Nice to meet you.

461
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,110
Yes, this is his mother's work.

462
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,060
Homemade.

463
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,910
Fermented black bean hotpot. Delicious.

464
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,080
Please, have a seat, Mrs. Dai.

465
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,430
After lunch,

466
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,950
we can go row a boat.

467
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:45,430
Okay.

468
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,830
The weather is pretty good today.

469
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,830
Okay, let's try the dishes first.

470
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:49,870
Let's dig in.

471
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,590
This is the roast duck
I told you before.

472
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,200
It's very good.

473
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,060
Let me make you a wrap.

474
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,980
Well, let me first do a toast.

475
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,430
Welcome to Beijing, Mr. Zhou.

476
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,350
Mrs. Dai.

477
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,300
Well,

478
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,020
Mr. Zhou.

479
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,630
Did you come alone?

480
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,460
I'm so sorry.

481
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,910
It's been so busy in the store recently.

482
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,300
His mother has to take care
of the business in the store.

483
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,110
That's why I'm here alone.

484
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,220
So, your business

485
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,780
is more important than the marriage
of our children.

486
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:27,300
No.

487
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,110
It's the peak tourist season, Mrs. Dai.

488
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,910
Then, can you make the decisions
by yourself?

489
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,870
Of course, I can.

490
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,870
Here, that's why I'm here
to discuss it with you.

491
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,060
Come on, Mrs. Dai.

492
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,020
- Mom.
- Mrs. Dai.

493
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,780
I understood a little

494
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,060
about this situation.

495
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,430
Daji, Zhou Shui,

496
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:51,980
this is a house that you two picked, right?

497
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,060
Of course, they both picked it.

498
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,460
Did you think it was my idea?
I'm not the one staying there.

499
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,700
I understand. What I mean is

500
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,670
if the kids like it,

501
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,300
we as parents

502
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,740
will try our best to do everything

503
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,190
to fully support them.

504
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,460
I agree with your stance.

505
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,980
Well, let's get straight to the point.

506
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,390
Let me be clear,

507
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,300
as traditions stand,

508
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,190
the man buys the house in a marriage

509
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,500
while the woman buys a car.

510
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,740
Given that this situation
is quite special,

511
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:22,670
Daji.

512
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,670
I hope that our two families

513
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,540
can pile in on the
house down payment together.

514
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,780
1.5 million.

515
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,780
So, I took care of all the properties
back in my hometown.

516
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,640
Altogether, I managed to scrape
together about 600,000.

517
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,780
As for the rest,

518
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:40,830
I was hoping...

519
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,020
I was really hoping your family
could find a way to cover it.

520
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,830
Right.

521
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,630
That's great.

522
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,300
But

523
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,740
here's the situation on my end,

524
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,460
I should be upfront with you.

525
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,350
Last year,

526
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,460
I bought an apartment in Chongqing,

527
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:09,390
so I don't really have much left right now.

528
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,590
What I mean is

529
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:14,300
when we have the money, we can...

530
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,060
Hold on, hold on.

531
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:17,740
Daji,

532
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,220
they bought an apartment
in Chongqing last year.

533
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,670
Do you know about that?

534
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,830
Mrs. Dai, here's the thing.

535
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:31,300
My parents did buy
an apartment in Chongqing last year.

536
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,540
But it wasn't meant

537
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,800
to be a place for Daji and me
to live after we get married.

538
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,060
It's actually a home they
bought for themselves to retire in,

539
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,220
after working hard their whole lives.

540
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,910
Hang on, I'm confused.

541
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,780
Are you saying the same apartment
is supposed to be

542
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,150
both a retirement home for your
parents and your marital home?

543
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,360
- Is that what you mean?
- No, no.

544
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:50,740
Mrs. Dai.

545
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,220
Zhou Shui,

546
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,780
are you going to take our Daji back

547
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,390
to Chongqing

548
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,870
and live with your parents?

549
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:55,430
Mrs. Dai,

550
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,670
please listen to me.

551
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,150
What I mean is,

552
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,720
wherever the kids want to live,
that's up to them.

553
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,540
For now, we thought

554
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,120
that apartment could temporarily
serve as their marital house.

555
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,950
Why don't you just
sell the place in Chongqing?

556
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,110
Wouldn't that cover the cost?

557
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,780
Mrs. Dai,

558
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,910
I just don't think it's right

559
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,020
to ask my parents to sell
the home they bought

560
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,220
for retirement just because
Daji and I need a place to live.

561
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,280
Let me tell you something,

562
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,910
marriage isn't just
between the two of you.

563
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,910
It's between two families.

564
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,110
And right now, I've sold

565
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,870
all the property I had
for my own retirement

566
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,190
just to support Daji.

567
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,190
Mom...

568
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,220
- Mrs. Dai, let me do the maths for you.
- Just sell the place in Chongqing.

569
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,300
Look, our company
is doing well overall right now.

570
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,980
If we can land a big project,

571
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,190
for a 1.5 million yuan apartment plus...

572
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,540
Zhou Shui!

573
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,560
Since when do you think you can
come here and crunch numbers with me?

574
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,780
Mrs. Dai, I wasn't trying to...

575
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,670
Alright, that's enough.

576
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,720
I raised my daughter
through thick and thin,

577
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,000
and now you think it's your
place to talk to me about numbers?

578
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,040
He didn't mean it like that.

579
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:49,910
Then what did he mean?

580
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,020
Go on, explain it to me.

581
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,440
Zhou Shui,

582
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,300
what did you say when you came
to our house a few years ago?

583
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,110
You asked for two years

584
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,780
to give Daji a home,

585
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,780
to buy her an apartment.

586
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,060
Now all these years have passed,

587
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,630
have you kept your promise?

588
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,500
Let me tell you,

589
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,500
a real man takes responsibility.

590
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,390
If you make a promise,
you follow through.

591
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:09,910
Zhou Shui

592
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,950
isn't just making empty promises.

593
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,910
He means what he says,
he is responsible.

594
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,590
And how exactly is he
taking responsibility?

595
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,830
Is this all just talk?

596
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,060
Mrs. Dai...

597
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,640
Let's just sit down

598
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,830
and talk this through calmly.

599
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,280
So what you're really saying is,

600
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,400
you're not going to sell
your apartment in Chongqing

601
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,600
to buy a place here in Beijing,

602
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,430
is that it?

603
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:27,910
Mrs. Dai,

604
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,630
we will buy a place in Beijing,
I promise.

605
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,060
Enough! Don't say another word.

606
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:31,920
That's not what he...

607
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,430
Dad!

608
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,780
You can't expect us
to buy a place in Beijing

609
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,640
just because you sold your home,

610
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,400
and then turn around

611
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,220
and expect my parents to sell the
home they bought for retirement too.

612
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,080
That's not fair, is it?

613
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,150
Shut up!

614
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,150
Zhou Shui.

615
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,190
Zhou Shui, don't say that.

616
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,590
Are you listening to yourself?

617
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,700
I can live in a retirement home.

618
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:58,300
I can sell my house
because I want to support my daughter.

619
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,360
And your parents can't?

620
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,480
Wow. You've really got it
all worked out, haven't you?

621
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,840
What a clever little plan,
slapped me right in the face with it.

622
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,480
Forget it. We're not
getting married anymore.

623
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,560
Let's just forget about it.

624
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,590
Forget about it, huh?

625
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,540
Zhou Shui,

626
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,060
is that what you wanted to hear?

627
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,220
Is that how you really feel?

628
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,320
Mrs. Dai, I never said that.

629
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,000
I've always wanted to marry Daji.
When it comes to buying a place...

630
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,160
Then it must be your father
who doesn't want this marriage.

631
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,680
That's not true. I do want them
to get married. As soon as possible.

632
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,080
Then why won't you contribute
some money to buy a house for them?

633
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,880
Mom, stop. Just stop.

634
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,240
Let's go.

635
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:37,760
Why won't you?

636
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,240
Please stop.

637
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,630
You keep saying you want to get married,
but when it comes time

638
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,780
to actually step up, there's nothing.

639
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,060
My daughter gave you
eight years of her life.

640
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,500
And in the end, she got nothing.

641
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,020
Not even a real promise.

642
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,870
This marriage isn't happening.

643
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,060
It's over.

644
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:51,780
Let's go.

645
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,430
We're just going to step outside
and cool off for a bit. Sorry.

646
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:58,390
Don't get worked up so easily.

647
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,590
That mother-in-law of yours

648
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,980
has got one fiery temper.

649
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,390
Kid,

650
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,700
you're really in for it down the line.

651
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,830
There you go again.

652
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,540
Seriously.

653
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,190
You're not pretty when you're mad,

654
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,260
you know that?

655
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,590
Come on, don't be angry anymore.

656
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,840
Forget about that nonsense.
You think I'm joking with you?

657
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,430
Owning a home is one of the most
important things in a woman's life.

658
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,480
It's your sense of security.
Do you understand that?

659
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,260
I know.

660
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,260
You're right.

661
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,350
I get it.

662
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,590
But think about it,

663
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,190
his dad,

664
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:50,950
he just got here,

665
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,950
and right away you're already fighting

666
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:54,630
with him.

667
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,020
That's not easy for them either.

668
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,640
His parents are doing the best they can,
with what little they have.

669
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,950
They run this tiny hotpot place,

670
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,540
and they've worked their whole lives

671
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,540
just to afford a small apartment
in the city.

672
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,110
That's their retirement home.

673
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,020
If they sell it,
how are they supposed to live?

674
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,870
Why are you feeling sorry for them?

675
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,630
Tell me,

676
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,430
do you love Daji?

677
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:16,670
Of course I do.

678
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,950
Do you really want to marry her?

679
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,110
Good.

680
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,590
Then we have to contribute
the money. It's worth it.

681
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,950
Mom, I'm your daughter.

682
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,160
Of course I care about you too.

683
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,520
You just said it out of the blue
that you're selling your house.

684
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,540
Where would you even live?

685
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,830
I'll move into a nursing home.

686
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,220
Oh my God.

687
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,160
Is this necessary?

688
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,430
You have a perfectly good house,

689
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,040
but you'd rather live in a nursing home.

690
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,000
Think about it,
if we spend all the money

691
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,060
just to cover a down payment,
is it really worth it?

692
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,780
Right?

693
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,460
Right now we're finally living
a little more comfortably,

694
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,600
and then on top of that

695
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,500
we'll have to start paying
a mortgage every month.

696
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,120
Just stop and think
about it for a second.

697
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,560
He's a man.

698
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,870
He says he loves you,
but when it comes time to buy a home,

699
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:00,540
he shrinks away like a coward.

700
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,220
You tell me, is that really love?

701
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:06,830
But Dad, if you sell the apartment,

702
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,300
where are you and Mom going to live?

703
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,880
The old house back home isn't livable.

704
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:17,430
When I get back, I'll put
the apartment up for sale.

705
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:22,300
And I'll transfer the hotpot shop
to someone else too.

706
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,120
Your mom and I will move back
to our hometown.

707
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,150
We're getting up there in age.

708
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,630
We can live anywhere.

709
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,950
And that house back home,

710
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,870
once we fix it up a bit,

711
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,220
it'll be just fine.

712
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,220
Daji's been with you for so many years.

713
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,540
You owe her a proper future.

714
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,430
Shichahai...

715
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:02,670
Shichahai...

716
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,630
Shichahai...

717
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,910
You're so small.

718
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,390
Can you even really be called a "sea"?

719
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,390
In Beijing,

720
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,220
this is the sea.

721
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,260
But when will little shrimp like us

722
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,020
ever get to swim in the sea?

723
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,830
Aren't we already swimming in it?

724
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:41,980
Is she asleep?

725
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,870
Did you talk to your dad?

726
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,110
What did he say?

727
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,190
He'll sell the apartment.

728
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,260
Wait,

729
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:02,670
your parents are selling their home,
and my mom wants to sell hers too,

730
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,630
all just to scrape together
a down payment?

731
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,260
It's so ridiculous.

732
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:11,300
Why are we suddenly getting married?

733
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,300
And suddenly needing to buy
a multi-million yuan apartment?

734
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,260
It's insane.

735
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,630
Do you not want to get married?

736
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,980
Is that a gray hair?

737
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:20,780
Look here.

738
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,500
This one, is it?

739
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,540
It really is.

740
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:24,760
Don't pull it.

741
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,740
They say if you pull one,
more will grow.

742
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,920
If we add up everything we have now,
including what the company's worth,

743
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,500
how much do we have?

744
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,060
About 570 or 580 thousand.

745
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,020
So basically,

746
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:42,740
if we don't sell our parents' homes
and rely just on what we've got,

747
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,680
we're still short almost
a million for the down payment.

748
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:46,910
A million...

749
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,350
Hi, Mao!

750
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,590
Hi, Shui!

751
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,390
So, what's up?

752
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:00,950
Oh, nothing really.

753
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,390
What are you up to?

754
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,910
Same old, same old.

755
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,700
Why? Got some orders for me?

756
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,190
No orders.

757
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,060
I just...

758
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,590
You're free to talk, right?

759
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,020
I need to ask you something.

760
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,830
Yeah, I can talk.

761
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,350
Shui,

762
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,390
are you and Daji making a movie?

763
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,350
I knew it!

764
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:23,950
You brat!

765
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,430
You used to say

766
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,780
that if you ever got the chance
to make a movie,

767
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,260
you'd get us Five Useless Misfits

768
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,460
back together.

769
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,830
I've been waiting for this day,

770
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,540
you know?

771
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,260
Mao,

772
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,460
I'm not calling about a movie.

773
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,110
Not a movie?

774
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,110
Then what's up?

775
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,400
"Wishing a successful start
to Fallen Angels: Yanjiao Edition!"

776
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,540
I've asked you out so many times
and you've ignored me.

777
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,060
So what brings you here today?

778
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,720
Don't tell me you're here
to borrow money?

779
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,480
You're really here to borrow money?

780
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,300
Yes.

781
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,430
Zhou Shui and I are
planning to get married.

782
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,540
Congratulations.

783
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,350
I always knew you two were meant

784
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,780
to have the perfect ending.

785
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,950
I'm not sure about
the "perfect ending" part,

786
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,350
but right now, we need to buy a place.

787
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,500
We're still short about
a million for the down payment.

788
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,390
Can you help us?

789
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,220
You mean cash?

790
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,950
I don't have any cash.

791
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,390
Liao only

792
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,300
gave me cards I can use to buy things.

793
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:42,350
They're with the driver.
I can't even withdraw money from them.

794
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,390
To be honest,

795
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,950
I don't think I even

796
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,260
have enough to buy a plane ticket.

797
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,430
Why?

798
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,430
Is he afraid you'll run away?

799
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,430
From here,

800
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,670
it doesn't look that tall.

801
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,670
Liao had someone check
it out when he bought it.

802
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,150
They said it faced a mountain
from the front door. Good feng shui.

803
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,980
What about you? Do you think it's good?

804
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,540
The good feng shui, the fancy furniture,

805
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,540
none of it really belongs to me.

806
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,590
Liao never gives me actual money.

807
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,590
He just gives me

808
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,350
the illusion that I'm wealthy.

809
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,700
Jingshu, I'm sorry

810
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,430
for asking for money
as soon as I saw you.

811
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,430
I shouldn't have done that.

812
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,800
Let's go get some
beauty treatments later.

813
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,020
There's a new medical
aesthetics clinic in CWTC.

814
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,780
We can use my card.

815
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,430
Jingshu, I can't today.

816
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,960
I've got to head back for
a meeting this afternoon.

817
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,080
The client's been rushing us.

818
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,220
Go without me.

819
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,260
Let's do this another time.

820
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,440
Another time is just a nice way
of saying it's never going to happen.

821
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,060
Your apartment is

822
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,540
worth quite a lot, isn't it?

823
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,190
Why don't you just sell it?

824
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,260
Or maybe mortgage it,

825
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,260
pull out some cash,

826
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,630
and then just run.

827
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,460
You know what?
I've actually thought about that.

828
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,430
You're laughing?

829
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,540
Really?

830
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,670
I'm trying to tell you,

831
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,500
youth doesn't last.

832
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,540
Beauty doesn't last.

833
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,350
You need to hold on to something that
gives you real power, real security.

834
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,190
Got it?

835
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,670
Got it, Daji.

836
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,020
You really care about me.

837
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,230
Hey, Liao.

838
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,430
I wanted to ask for a favor.

839
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:30,500
About the ad campaign for our
new property development,

840
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,460
could you let a friend
of mine handle it?

841
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,100
What friend?

842
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,980
She's like a big sister to me.

843
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,160
She's going through
a tough time with her business.

844
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,350
I really want to help her out.

845
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,660
Haven't I told you

846
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,910
not to get involved in
my business affairs?

847
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,460
I'm only asking this one time.

848
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,390
Just do it for me,

849
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,100
okay?

850
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,460
And what about that
thing I asked you for?

851
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,180
Have you made up your mind?

852
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,980
You asked me for something,

853
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,580
and now I'm asking you for something.

854
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,020
I just want a son.

855
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:29,950
What?

856
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,870
What's going on?

857
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,060
What happened?

858
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,980
Our lives are about to change,
big times!

859
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,680
What do you mean?

860
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,390
A real estate tycoon just reached
out to us to do an ad campaign.

861
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,460
The budget is two million.

862
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,790
That's a lot!

863
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,500
Hang on, hang on.

864
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,060
No middlemen taking a cut?

865
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:46,910
No.

866
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,270
Hold on,

867
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,100
how did you even land a gig like this?

868
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,660
He just showed up,

869
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,580
came straight to us himself.

870
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:54,660
No way!

871
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,270
If we're smart with the budget,
we could pocket a million easy.

872
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,020
We're good.

873
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,120
You're getting a raise, Yu!

874
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,950
Thanks, Shui!

875
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,120
Let's get to work!

876
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,180
Daji,

877
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,580
if we really make that million,

878
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,100
can I borrow a little?

879
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,180
You know how it is with artists,
we're always broke,

880
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,060
and we owe our girlfriends
a ton of money.

881
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,140
Shameless!

882
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,460
But I like it.

883
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,870
Because I love investing in artists,

884
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,230
especially the handsome ones like you.

885
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,270
I really don't want my parents
to sell their apartment,

886
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,830
but I promised your mom
we'd buy a place in Beijing.

887
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,020
If we don't,

888
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,540
she'll come charging back
from Ezhou and chop me in half.

889
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,230
Alright.

890
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:31,580
No problem.

891
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,620
I'll lend it to you.

892
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,830
How much do you need?

893
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:34,710
One million.

894
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,790
Come on, that's all I have!

895
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:37,000
I...

896
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,230
Keep your eyes on the road!

897
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:38,680
My phone.

898
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,360
- You...
- Come on.

899
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:39,870
It's ringing.

900
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:40,760
Someone's calling me.

901
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,200
Fine, fine.

902
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:41,980
Hello.

903
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:44,870
This is Zhou Shui.

904
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,460
You want me to make a movie?

905
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,960
Dude, let me give you some advice.

906
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,160
Turn yourself in. It's not
too late to do the right thing.

907
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,280
Taking advantage of someone's dream
to scam their money

908
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,500
is the lowest, most shameless
thing you can do. Got it?

909
00:36:59,430 --> 00:36:59,960
Who was that?

910
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,800
Remember when I first came to Beijing

911
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,880
and someone said they wanted
to make a movie with me?

912
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,720
In the end, they scammed me
out of all my money.

913
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,760
It's another one of those.

914
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,390
Another scammer?

915
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:12,200
After all these years,
they're still using the same script.

916
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,950
"I'd like to offer you a chance."

917
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,910
I'm not falling into
the same trap twice.

918
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,180
Did he say his name?

919
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,270
Which company?

920
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:23,270
Something like Ruidi Pictures.

921
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,830
His name is Man something.

922
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:25,430
Can't remember.

923
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,350
Man Jiaxin!

924
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,980
Yeah! How'd you know?

925
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,230
It was Man Jiaxin?

926
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,180
Who doesn't know that name?

927
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,430
The one and only producer, Man Jiaxin!

928
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:35,910
He's real?

929
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,710
Of course he's real!

930
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,640
Have you been living under a rock?
Look him up.

931
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:39,580
(Beacon Camp)

932
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,580
Take a look.

933
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,620
These are my works.

934
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:43,980
Do you believe me now?

935
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,270
I really like this one.

936
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,750
That's Mr. Bai's work.

937
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,180
I was being overly cautious before.
Sorry about that.

938
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,040
No worries. Let's get to business.

939
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,840
You wrote the script for
Such A Good Love, right?

940
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,140
Come on.

941
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:58,950
I wrote it.

942
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:01,270
But that was from a long time ago.

943
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,830
They sent the script to me.

944
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,870
As soon as I read it,
I knew it'd be a hit.

945
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,750
So we'd like to work with you.

946
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,100
How?

947
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,950
We want you to direct the film.

948
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:15,270
We're looking at

949
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,310
a preliminary investment of 20 million.

950
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:18,950
20 million...

951
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:24,710
If we turned that 20 million into cash

952
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,720
and tossed it off here,

953
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,310
do you think it'd crush the cars below?

954
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:27,980
Definitely.

955
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,270
Daji,

956
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:33,350
are we really really making a
film with a 20 million investment?

957
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:35,870
We're making a film with
a 20 million investment!

958
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,430
Period. Exclamation point.

959
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,710
How long have we been in Beijing?

960
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,500
Nine years.

961
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,310
And now we're finally making a movie.

962
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,140
Who was it, way back then,

963
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,100
who said you'd shine one day?

964
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,350
Was I wrong?

965
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,230
You were right, Daji.

966
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,620
The Scandalous Couple is making a movie!

967
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,500
We're making a movie!

968
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,580
Look, it's October now.

969
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,430
The latest we can

970
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,390
deliver the ad is the end of November.

971
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,200
So during that time,

972
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,840
you can work on
revising the movie script.

973
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:09,430
Shooting the ad
and rewriting the script?

974
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,710
My brain is gonna explode!

975
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,540
How about this,
I'll handle the script revisions.

976
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,310
You just focus on
finishing the ad shoot.

977
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,600
When that's done,
you're going straight into the film crew.

978
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,660
Let Yu take over post-production.

979
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,840
- You got it?
- Yes.

980
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,120
No room for mistakes, alright?

981
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,320
Okay.

982
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,920
But when it's time
to meet with the client,

983
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,400
you two definitely need to be there.

984
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,140
They're hiring you.

985
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,750
We'll figure that out
when the time comes.

986
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,580
How long do you think
post-production will take?

987
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,180
Post?

988
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,200
About a month and a half.

989
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,750
About a month and a half.

990
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,870
November... January.

991
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:38,980
Mid-January.

992
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,460
That'll work!

993
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:41,960
Yeah!

994
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,750
We start filming the movie
on February 15th.

995
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,270
We've got more than enough time!

996
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,790
Okay.

997
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:47,660
- We can do this.
- Okay.

998
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:48,580
Is that my phone?

999
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,180
Yes.

1000
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,750
I have to answer it. Excuse me.

1001
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,310
Hello.

1002
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,500
This is she.

1003
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,950
Let's drop the medium shot.

1004
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,950
The wide shot's just too
time-consuming this way.

1005
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,790
Are you certain?

1006
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,140
Hang on, I'm sure we
can work something out.

1007
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:06,830
Okay?

1008
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:09,910
Alright. Thank you.

1009
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,180
What's going on?

1010
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,430
I just got a call from
Fortune Real Estate.

1011
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,180
The development we're
supposed to shoot for,

1012
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,360
the completion's been delayed.

1013
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:23,180
They want to push the ad shoot

1014
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,910
to February 16th.

1015
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,950
February 16th?

1016
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:27,580
Yes.

1017
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,840
But aren't you guys starting
the film shoot on the 15th?

1018
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,540
Yes.

1019
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,310
Then who's going to shoot the ad?

1020
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,430
Push back the start date?

1021
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,910
Are you kidding me?

1022
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,580
Absolutely not.

1023
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,460
The actors' contracts are signed.

1024
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,660
We have to start shooting
on February 15th.

1025
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:52,060
Mr. Man,

1026
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,100
just give us one week.

1027
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,500
Not even a day.

1028
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,360
These are big-name actors.

1029
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,400
It was hard enough getting them
to clear their schedules

1030
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,710
for a brand-new director like you.

1031
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,460
How am I supposed to explain this?

1032
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,240
"Sorry, our director needs to
go shoot a commercial first"?

1033
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,140
What's more important,

1034
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,580
the ad or the film?

1035
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,350
The director's fee might not be much,

1036
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,100
but this is a huge opportunity for you.

1037
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,790
If you insist on doing the ad,

1038
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,710
you can forget about the film then.

1039
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:20,390
Mr. Man...

1040
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:23,710
He hanged up.

1041
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,500
Alright then.

1042
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,020
There's no other way.

1043
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,620
We have to decide,

1044
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:31,140
the movie or the ad?

1045
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,310
Do we choose our dream or a home?

1046
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,750
What's your decision?

1047
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,000
Let me think about it.

1048
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,100
You said it yourself,

1049
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,790
in moments like this,
you've got to follow your gut.

1050
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,830
Before this red light turns green,

1051
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:02,390
I want your answer.

1052
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:16,980
How about you take the ad,

1053
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:18,500
and I shoot the film?

1054
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:21,230
Shameless. You've got ten seconds left.

1055
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:33,580
Then I'll shoot the ad,
and you do the movie.

1056
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,180
Eight seconds.

1057
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,600
No way. Such A Good Love is our story.

1058
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,620
If we shoot it, we shoot it together.
Six seconds.

1059
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,620
But if we really go all-in
on this movie,

1060
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,870
we won't have money for a place.

1061
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,870
And without a home,
how do we get married? Four.

1062
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:49,100
You're overthinking it.

1063
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:49,910
Last two seconds.

1064
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,390
Just follow your heart.

1065
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:52,790
Whatever you choose, go with that.
