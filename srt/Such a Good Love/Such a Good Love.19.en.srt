=Episode 19=

3
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,660
(Summer 2012, Beijing)

4
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,100
Hello?

5
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,100
Hello, is this Deng Xiaoya's family?

6
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,790
Yes, I am.

7
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,510
Who's this?

8
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,660
This is Beitan Hospital.

9
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,070
Hospital?

10
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,260
You've been in pain for six months,
and you're only coming in now.

11
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,240
Your daughter doesn't seem
to be taking this seriously.

12
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,070
For the past six months,
you've had severe upper abdominal pain,

13
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,660
edema, and loss in weight.

14
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,840
Are there any other symptoms?

15
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,860
Not really.

16
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,630
Just that

17
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,820
I wake up a lot at night

18
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,510
to use the bathroom,

19
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,860
don't sleep well,

20
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,980
and have stomach pain.

21
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,420
I see.

22
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,030
Doctor,

23
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,540
what's wrong

24
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,380
with my mom?

25
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,630
I can't be sure yet.

26
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,860
She needs

27
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,190
to do a bladder biopsy

28
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,910
to rule out cancer.

29
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,100
- Cancer?
- Cancer?

30
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,510
It's a possibility.

31
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,100
Here's the consent form for anesthesia.

32
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,580
Sign it.

33
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,980
After the examination,
come back for the results in a week.

34
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:15,980
This way.

35
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:19,700
Don't worry.

36
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,580
Why are you holding me so tight?

37
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,750
It's just a small examination.
I'll be out in ten minutes.

38
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,910
I know.

39
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,660
Don't worry.

40
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,860
I'm not. You shouldn't be either.

41
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,630
I... I'm not.

42
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,310
It's me.

43
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,070
I'm Xiaoya.

44
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,510
Right, you're the bravest.

45
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,540
I'm afraid of nothing.

46
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,420
Excuse me.

47
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,420
She's Deng Xiaoya.

48
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,860
Are we in the right place?

49
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,320
Yes, come in.

50
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,140
- All right.
- Okay.

51
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:43,840
Give me your bag.

52
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,310
Don't worry.

53
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,680
Your bag. Don't be afraid.
I'll be right here. I won't go far.

54
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,260
I won't go far.

55
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:13,860
Listen.

56
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,470
Don't tell Zhou Shui

57
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,020
that I'm sick.

58
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,190
Why?

59
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,630
Do not tell him.

60
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,340
If you two get married

61
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,820
and his parents find out I'm sick,

62
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,670
they won't agree to it.

63
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,630
No family wants

64
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,990
their son to marry a woman
with a burden.

65
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,510
Listen carefully.

66
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,140
I can't have you judged

67
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,820
before you're married.

68
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,600
I won't allow that.

69
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,340
Hello?

70
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,110
Um.

71
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,440
Can you call in for me?

72
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,460
I'm not going back to the office
this afternoon.

73
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,800
Is everything all right?

74
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,820
Yes. I just...

75
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,430
I'm with my mom.
We're going shopping this afternoon.

76
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,340
All right, got it.

77
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,780
How was it? Does it hurt?

78
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,310
I'm fine.

79
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,140
You look weak.

80
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,580
They gave you anesthesia, right?
Sit down.

81
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,110
How much did it cost?

82
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,870
Don't worry about money.

83
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,820
It wasn't much.

84
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,820
You want to sit down for a bit
or head back?

85
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,190
Go home.

86
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,310
Ms. Fang, do you have a minute?

87
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,580
Daji, I thought you were
taking the day off.

88
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,870
Why are you here after work?

89
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,340
Well, I just want to ask

90
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,260
if I can withdraw my money
from the health insurance account.

91
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,260
Also, can the housing provident fund

92
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,460
be taken out?

93
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,190
Why do you want that?

94
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,140
Are you buying a house?

95
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,140
No.

96
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:18,900
I...

97
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,070
My mom is sick.

98
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,820
She had some tests today.

99
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,070
The results aren't out yet,

100
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,630
but if it turns out bad,

101
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,990
she might need surgery.

102
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,070
But I don't have enough money right now.

103
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,460
But that's not allowed under the rules.

104
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,550
I can only ask for you.

105
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,580
Thank you, Ms. Fang. It's urgent.

106
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,950
All right. Don't worry.
It'll be all right.

107
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,480
Why did it suddenly
start raining so heavily?

108
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,430
The rain is too strong.

109
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,140
Let's wait for it to stop.

110
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:00,580
All right.

111
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,340
Are you cold?

112
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,110
A little.

113
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,700
Let me hug you.

114
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:24,990
My motorbike.

115
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,110
- My motorbike.
- Dumbbell!

116
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,110
My motorbike fell.

117
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,020
Don't go.

118
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,430
We'll go when the rain stops.

119
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,220
Don't worry.

120
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,950
Dumbbell, it's too dangerous.

121
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,630
Forget about your motorbike.

122
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:55,820
Go home!

123
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,580
It's too dangerous.

124
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,220
Go!

125
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
What's gotten into you?

126
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,670
Go!

127
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,750
I don't have an umbrella.

128
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,000
Get on.

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,920
It's raining too hard.
Let's wait until it stops.

130
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,340
Get on!

131
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,950
Get on!

132
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,080
Dude, you don't have to do this.

133
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,680
What's so interesting about
crashing a car in Beijing?

134
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,460
Crash it in Wall Street.

135
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,220
A chase scene at Arc de Triomphe

136
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,680
looks way more interesting than this.

137
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,980
Are you bad at writing big scenes?

138
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,580
How did you know that?

139
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,790
The highest-budget movie I've written

140
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,790
is 50,000 yuan.

141
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,390
She's joking, right?

142
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,390
Mister,

143
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,190
I don't think the big scenes
you mentioned

144
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,580
fit well in our movie.

145
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,430
Is she the scriptwriter or me?

146
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,480
Aren't I the one who decides
the tone of the movie?

147
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,270
Aren't I the scriptwriter?

148
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,220
I brought Mr. Yu in

149
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,670
to lead the script.

150
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,270
You should learn from him.

151
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,340
Just do as I say and change the script.

152
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,700
Me?

153
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,980
Aren't you a scriptwriter?

154
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,580
Do you know the rules?

155
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,580
Yu, calm down.

156
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,100
Does she know who I am?

157
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,150
Don't mind her.

158
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:51,910
Calm down.

159
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,640
You call her a planning director?

160
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,880
I brought her over from Shendu.

161
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,440
Every scriptwriter has been through this.

162
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,150
She's still young.
Our company needs people.

163
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,120
It's just a title.

164
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,760
She thinks it's a bad deal
to write the script under my name, huh?

165
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,040
Right.

166
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,860
Please sit.

167
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,430
Sit down first.

168
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,500
I'll be back soon.

169
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,790
Zhaoyang,

170
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,220
I've revised this script

171
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,460
many times,

172
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,980
but the payment for the first version
hasn't come through yet.

173
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,070
When will I receive it?

174
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,270
Daji,

175
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,070
the company is taking on

176
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,460
all the initial costs and risks.

177
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,120
I'm under a lot of pressure.

178
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,190
You're a senior in this company.
You need to think about the company.

179
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,860
Is money tight for you right now?

180
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,270
If you have any problem,

181
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,910
I can lend you some first.

182
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,100
It's all right, Zhaoyang.

183
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,220
I... I'll change the script.

184
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,500
All right.

185
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:55,910
Hello?

186
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:07,760
Jingshu.

187
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,040
- Dumbbell, Jingshu.
- Dumbbell.

188
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,190
What happened?

189
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:11,950
It looks serious.

190
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,500
Why are you injured?

191
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,790
We rear-ended someone's car.

192
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,430
Rear-ended? How?

193
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,620
Ask him.

194
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,340
Hand. Your hand.

195
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:19,980
Just a bruise.

196
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,550
Does it hurt?

197
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,670
Fractures.

198
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,270
Concussion.

199
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,360
Are you hurt anywhere else?

200
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,640
Why were you riding in the rain?

201
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,480
- Are you crazy?
- It needs at least two months.

202
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,000
What else was I supposed to do then?
I don't have a car.

203
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,700
Why are you so fierce?

204
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,700
There's 4,000 yuan on my card.

205
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,860
Pay the bill and fix that person's car.

206
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,500
Do you have any?

207
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,030
I...

208
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,860
It's not enough.

209
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,320
How much more do you need?

210
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,580
The car was a Rolls-Royce.

211
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,070
I have about 10,000 on my card.

212
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,190
Let's pool our money together.
You should have something left, right?

213
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:15,980
No.

214
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,430
Didn't you get paid this month?

215
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,860
I resigned.

216
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,550
You are doing fine at the gym.

217
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,790
Why did you quit?

218
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,680
How else was I supposed to
pick you up after work?

219
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,670
It's all because of you.

220
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:39,790
Mrs. Dai.

221
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,600
You're finally back.

222
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:40,950
Mom.

223
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,640
You're soaking wet. What happened?

224
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,920
Nothing. Got caught in the rain.

225
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,500
Are you cold?

226
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,310
No.

227
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,040
Jingshu. What happened to you?

228
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,080
It was a little accident.

229
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,460
Mrs. Dai.

230
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,430
Dumbbell.

231
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,550
You...

232
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,460
A little accident.

233
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,100
Are you okay?

234
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,580
She got a little bruise on her hand.

235
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,220
We're going inside.

236
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,150
Good night, Mrs. Dai.

237
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,580
Remember to rinse
your wound with salt water.

238
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:03,740
Rest up early.

239
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,820
Are they okay?

240
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,310
They're fine.
It was a motorbike accident.

241
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,070
Mrs. Dai,

242
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,340
I'm going to dry my clothes.

243
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,580
I'm heading out to work later.

244
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:15,980
Zhou Shui, wait for me.

245
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,310
I'm going too. Let's go together.

246
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,500
It's late. You're still working.

247
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,550
Don't you need sleep?

248
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,550
I have a lot to do.

249
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,860
I need to finish it.

250
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,430
Don't go.

251
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,080
Look at you. You're drenched.

252
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,620
It's fine. I just got a little wet.

253
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,340
- I'll dry off.
- Your hands are cold.

254
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:29,860
It's fine.

255
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,620
Well,

256
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,670
everyone in Beijing works overtime.

257
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,070
You know what time it is now?
Everyone is still working now.

258
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,920
If you don't believe me,
go look for yourself.

259
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,960
All lights are still on.

260
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,980
It's true. I mean it.

261
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,790
What's wrong?

262
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,070
What's wrong? Not feeling well?

263
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,070
I suddenly feel sleepy.

264
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,820
Then go back to sleep.

265
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,030
No.

266
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:03,860
I must

267
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,950
finish the script tonight.

268
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,430
I'm so close.

269
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,030
Don't worry. I'll rest for five minutes.

270
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,310
I just...

271
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,550
I just suddenly thought of
my primary school days.

272
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,950
After school,

273
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,980
my mom would lock me inside the house

274
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,910
and then go to work.

275
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,030
I'd stare at the clock.

276
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,700
As soon as it hit seven, I'd press
my ear against the door, listening.

277
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,430
Every time I heard
the sound of high heels,

278
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,670
I hoped it was her.

279
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,070
But it never was.

280
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,700
I really resented her back then.

281
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:17,740
Her office

282
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,430
was so close to home,

283
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,950
how could she not
at least take two hours a day

284
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,980
to make me a meal

285
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,620
or just talk with me?

286
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,550
But she never did.

287
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,790
Back then, her workplace
wasn't doing well.

288
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,740
She had to juggle a part-time job

289
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,100
while taking night classes.

290
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,910
On top of that, my grandma was sick.

291
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,190
She bore everything

292
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,150
on her own.

293
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,030
It was only later that I understood

294
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,790
that because we were
a single-parent family,

295
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,070
she was afraid I'd be bullied,

296
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,670
so she made her seem aggressive.

297
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,150
So,

298
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,950
Daji, if you're feeling pressured,

299
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,950
you have to tell me.

300
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,100
I can help too.

301
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,820
So...

302
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,860
So, what am I even stressed about?

303
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,310
Changing the script is nothing.

304
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,390
Daji,

305
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,950
you should go home.

306
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,270
Don't go to work.

307
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,790
You're exhausted.

308
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,920
You can barely keep your eyes open.
Let's go home.

309
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,220
I'm good.
I'll feel better once I start working.

310
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,400
You go back first. Go home now.

311
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:42,920
I'm not tired.

312
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,460
- I have to work on the script.
- Be good.

313
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,840
You can't even keep your eyes open.

314
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,520
Look at yourself.

315
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:46,940
I can. I...

316
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,880
Enough, give me your bag.

317
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,160
I'll feel better once I'm working.

318
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,000
Don't worry about me.

319
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,550
Be good, okay?

320
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,910
I have to work tonight.

321
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,580
I really need to finish it by tonight.

322
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:54,790
Zhou Shui.

323
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,910
Can you listen to me?

324
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,070
What are you doing?

325
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:57,950
Go home and sleep.

326
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,820
No, I need to finish the script.

327
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,110
Mom, you turned off my alarm again.

328
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,020
I told you I'd be late.

329
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,950
It wasn't me this time.

330
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,000
It was Zhou Shui.

331
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,430
Zhou Shui, you turned off my alarm...

332
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,880
("The Crazy Fare Meter"
It's revised.)

333
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,780
(Script edits)

334
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,500
(Script edits)

335
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,540
("The Crazy Fare Meter"
It's revised.)

336
00:18:02,618 --> 00:18:03,898
(Thank you)

337
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,190
What's going on here?

338
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,190
Mrs. Dai.

339
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,260
Don't touch it.

340
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,430
It's on fire.

341
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,200
Turn it off. Quick.

342
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:25,950
Like this?

343
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,780
Gosh.

344
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,830
What are you doing?

345
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,630
I finished my work,

346
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,700
so I thought

347
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,430
I'd cook something for Daji.

348
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,910
Look, everything is burned.

349
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,780
What even is this?

350
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,110
My goodness.

351
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:44,870
What's this?

352
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:45,780
Daji doesn't eat

353
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,540
chives.

354
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,300
Don't you know Daji doesn't eat that?

355
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,150
I know.

356
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,350
But isn't this scallion?

357
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,830
You can't even differentiate
scallions and chives.

358
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,980
And all this fatty meat.

359
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,060
What are you up to?

360
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,740
Enough. Stop messing around.

361
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,670
My goodness.

362
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,870
Everything is a mess.

363
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,060
Go out.

364
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,910
I'll handle this.

365
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:04,540
Go.

366
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,020
Mrs. Dai, I want to learn how to cook.

367
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,190
Can you teach me?

368
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,780
I just want Daji to have a warm meal

369
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,060
when she gets home.

370
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,630
All right, then.

371
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,740
Wash the chives.

372
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,020
Got it, Mrs. Dai.

373
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,350
Just rinse them

374
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,700
like this?

375
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,980
You have to wash them one by one,

376
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,870
like how movies are shot

377
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,870
one frame by one frame.

378
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,870
Life, too,

379
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,910
is lived one day at a time.

380
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,780
What are you waiting for?
Hurry up and wash them.

381
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,430
Okay.

382
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,870
But do I have to wash the chives?

383
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,190
Daji doesn't eat them.

384
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,910
That depends on who's cooking.

385
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,780
If it's you,

386
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,060
do you think

387
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,260
she'll eat them?

388
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,910
I know my daughter best.

389
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,830
The pan is heated up.

390
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,430
Put the pork belly in.

391
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,220
Put them in.

392
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,670
Heat the pan,

393
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,430
and stir-fry the meat
until the fat oozes out.

394
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,910
We call this "frying the pan".

395
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:05,670
Frying the pan.

396
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,430
- Yes.
- Got it.

397
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,460
Coming.

398
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,590
Good.

399
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,630
Turn the heat up.

400
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:11,150
Look.

401
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,460
A little salt.

402
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,630
You need to learn how to flip the pan.

403
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,460
Yes, right.

404
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,020
I think

405
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,260
you have more talent for cooking

406
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,260
than for making movies.

407
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:19,950
Really?

408
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,830
Mom.

409
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,460
Jeez, the busier I am,
the more you look for me.

410
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,430
Fried egg with scallion.

411
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:37,780
Breakfast is ready.

412
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,240
- Is it the Chongqing noodles?
- Jun.

413
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,320
Stop cleaning up. Come eat.

414
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:40,780
Coming.

415
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,350
Is it Chongqing noodles,

416
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:43,740
Sansan?

417
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,390
Chonging noodles!

418
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,260
What's Chongqing noodles?

419
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,700
Mr. Zhou made

420
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,540
the best noodles ever

421
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,460
in the universe.

422
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,700
Righty-ho.

423
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,700
Come. Eat it by yourself.

424
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,630
Zhou, I've told you so many times,

425
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,600
don't bring the clothes
from the restaurant back.

426
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,080
They're covered in grease and smoke.

427
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,980
I'll wash them for you.

428
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,110
Give them to me.

429
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,830
Come on.

430
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,390
Sit.

431
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,350
I didn't invite you here

432
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,300
to work.

433
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,760
I invited you over for breakfast.

434
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,600
If you keep doing this,
I won't let you in again.

435
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,280
Listen. You can either
hang them at the door

436
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,800
or take them downstairs. I'll wash them.

437
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,320
All right.

438
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:16,870
Okay. I'll stop.

439
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,630
Let's dig in.

440
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,430
Dig in. Here.

441
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,460
How does it taste?

442
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,220
Delicious.

443
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,980
(Autumn 2024, Chongqing)
I've taught you how to use chopsticks.

444
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,420
Give it a try.

445
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:35,830
What's going on?

446
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,400
What's going on here?

447
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,480
Sorry about this.
Please wait for a couple of minutes.

448
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,670
We're filming a movie upfront.

449
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,780
Filming a movie?

450
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,150
Go have a look.

451
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,540
Maybe you'll meet your friend.

452
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,590
I didn't work for long.

453
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,150
There won't be anyone I know.

454
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,150
Ms. Dai, what are we having for dinner?

455
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,060
Dinner?

456
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,220
I think I'll skip that.

457
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,740
I need to talk to Mr. Bai

458
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,950
about something later.

459
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,950
We'll eat at the airport.

460
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,350
Our flight's at 10 PM.

461
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,300
How about we go have that hotpot?

462
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,190
You haven't tried it yet.

463
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,590
Cut. Let them pass.

464
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,560
The line's too long
at that hotpot place.

465
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,430
I don't want to wait.

466
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:33,920
I'll wait in line for you.

467
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,590
Tong Leyi.

468
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,300
You came again.

469
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,700
You serve good hotpots here.

470
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,740
Where do I get a number?

471
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,280
Just wait a little while, all right?

472
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,540
But your friend has arrived.

473
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,780
Who?

474
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,630
Su Zihao.

475
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,300
Why are you here?

476
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,390
Leyi? I...

477
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,460
Are you here for the gossip?

478
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,350
Lucky you.

479
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,460
Ms. Dai will be here soon.

480
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,780
Really?

481
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,980
Let me check when she'll arrive.

482
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,020
Okay.

483
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,700
Uh... I'm sorry about last night.

484
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,390
I hope you're not mad.

485
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,870
No.

486
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
It's nothing. You're a teenager to me.

487
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,020
Are you really not mad?

488
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,590
Of course not.

489
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,870
- Tong Leyi?
- I'm really...

490
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,060
Leyi, what brings you here?

491
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,780
Um.

492
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,390
Let me introduce you.

493
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,430
You don't have to do that.

494
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,910
We've met before.

495
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,870
Right. We've met before. Did you forget?

496
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,300
Did you?

497
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,390
Sit.

498
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,300
Okay. Let's sit.

499
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,590
Why didn't you tell me she was coming?

500
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,350
I only ordered two cups of bubble tea.

501
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,280
I'll give her mine.

502
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,280
- Here. You can have it.
- Isn't that your favorite?

503
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:10,950
Drink it yourself, Zihao.

504
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:11,670
No thanks.

505
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,780
I don't need it.

506
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,220
What's going on between you two?

507
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,120
- The pot's here.
- We?

508
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:16,960
It was a coincidence.

509
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,720
Our mutual friend set us up
for a blind date.

510
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,950
Turned out we were classmates.

511
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,500
- Careful.
- Blind date, I see.

512
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,700
You went on a blind date?

513
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,220
Yeah.

514
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,150
Don't get the wrong idea.

515
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,670
There's nothing between us.

516
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,540
I'm here with my superior.

517
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,220
I know.

518
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,430
Zihao told me

519
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,110
that you weren't dating.

520
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,260
Of course not.

521
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,430
We never were.

522
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,390
Who would date a teenage boy?

523
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,110
Right?

524
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,110
Leyi,

525
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,910
do you have a boyfriend now?

526
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,260
No.

527
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,260
I don't date.

528
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,830
You've been single?

529
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,300
But I think

530
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,540
it's better to be with someone
than to be alone.

531
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:53,460
Should I tell her

532
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,060
what you said to me last night?

533
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,980
Well...

534
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,220
I was talking nonsense.
Yes. It was nonsense.

535
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,520
You were talking nonsense, right?

536
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,240
What was it about?

537
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,740
I thought you were serious about it.

538
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,460
What did he say?

539
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,500
Well...

540
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,390
Tell her.

541
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,300
- Well...
- What did you say? Tell me.

542
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:09,640
No, uh...

543
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,320
- Well, just...
- There's no need to hide it.

544
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:11,630
Tell me.

545
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,590
Right.

546
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,120
He said

547
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,840
he's liked you for seven years.

548
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,020
Three years in high school
and four years in college.

549
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,460
He's been secretly in love with you.

550
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,110
No way.

551
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,300
I didn't know that.

552
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,670
I wish you guys the best.

553
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,350
Thank you, Leyi.

554
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,870
This is on me.

555
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,430
They serve delicious hotpots.

556
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,350
It's famous here, Leyi.

557
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,110
No need.

558
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,060
I suddenly feel a little nauseous.

559
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:43,780
I'm leaving.

560
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:44,980
Take this back.

561
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:46,910
Leyi.

562
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:51,300
Tong Leyi. Why? You don't want to eat it?

563
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,080
No.

564
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,960
What's wrong with you?

565
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,700
I just got here,
and you said you're leaving.

566
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,950
Perhaps she's not feeling well.

567
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,500
I told you

568
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,590
don't need to come

569
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,740
to places like this.

570
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,910
Let's go back to Beijing.
I'll buy you a great meal.

571
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,540
My superior

572
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,260
is the top producer nationwide.

573
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,870
I heard that your superior's

574
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:33,190
ex-boyfriend is a director.

575
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,830
He's not anymore.

576
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,670
He's running a hotpot restaurant now.

577
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,630
Ms. Fang, talk about perfect timing.

578
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:50,870
Is there a mistake

579
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,190
in my salary?

580
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,670
It's a lot less.

581
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,190
Mr. Lai said

582
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,220
there's a problem
with your work attitude.

583
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,240
You've messed up several projects
and even had arguments with a client.

584
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:01,950
There's a problem

585
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,240
- with my work attitude?
- That's why it affects your pay.

586
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,700
Why don't you see how
Zhaoyang treated me?

587
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,110
That's not my problem.

588
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,500
Go talk to him if you want.

589
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,540
By the way, where's Daji?

590
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,830
She took a day off. Why?

591
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,110
She wants to withdraw
her provident fund,

592
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,400
but she doesn't meet the requirements,
so she can't get it.

593
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,060
Here's the rules. Show it to her.

594
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,350
Why does she want to
withdraw her provident fund?

595
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,830
You didn't know?

596
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,260
She said her mom was sick
and she needed the money urgently.

597
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,350
Tell her to figure something out.

598
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,320
You're here.

599
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,780
Come here. I have something
to talk to you.

600
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:45,670
What's it?

601
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:52,980
Shoot.

602
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,740
Why didn't you tell me your mom is sick?

603
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,220
Hold on.

604
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,400
How do you know?

605
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,000
I didn't know what happened to your mom,

606
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,080
but when I had a shooting
at the hospital last time,

607
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,640
I met an old Chinese medicine physician.

608
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,020
He said he could treat any illness.

609
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:06,870
Anything.

610
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,680
I've made an appointment with him.

611
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,540
Let's take your mom there
tomorrow afternoon.

612
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,060
Don't worry about the money.

613
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,670
I took all of my money out.

614
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:15,670
No. Don't worry. I don't need that.

615
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,520
I've taken her to the hospital
for examinations.

616
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,590
All the tests are done,

617
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,870
we just need to wait for the results.

618
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,110
You should pretend you don't know.

619
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,430
Stay out of this.

620
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,160
What do you mean by that, Dai Daji?

621
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,870
Your mom is sick.
We live under the same roof.

622
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,870
You want me to pretend I don't know?
I already knew.

623
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,300
Besides, I found out today.

624
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,220
The HR lady knew before me.

625
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,200
Daji, am I your boyfriend?

626
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,190
Yes, you are.
But it has nothing to do with this.

627
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,840
This is my own business.
I can handle it.

628
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,740
I don't need your help.

629
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,280
Daji, you said

630
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,110
loyalty is the most important thing
in a relationship, didn't you?

631
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,950
Now, you're in trouble,
and you didn't tell me.

632
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,260
How can I be loyal?

633
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,020
What am I to you?

634
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,630
What do you take me for?

635
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,740
I... I don't know.

636
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,590
I feel like an idiot

637
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,460
living here.

638
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,460
I want to share your burden.
I want to face this with you.

639
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,910
Can you tell me why
you didn't share this with me?

640
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,460
Answer me, Dai Daji.

641
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,150
My mom doesn't want me to tell you this.

642
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,300
Why not? I don't understand.

643
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,540
Why can't you tell me?

644
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,110
Because she thinks,

645
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,910
if we'll get married in the future,

646
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,430
she's afraid...

647
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,190
She's afraid that if we tell you this,

648
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:29,590
you'll think she's a burden.

649
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,190
But I won't.

650
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,500
I know you won't.

651
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,780
Still, I don't want to tell you.

652
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:43,020
Zhou Shui, I'm really afraid.

653
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,260
I'm afraid

654
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,150
that once

655
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,740
I say it out,

656
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,430
it'll become real.

657
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,350
I'm afraid
that if my mom really has cancer,

658
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,950
I'll lose her forever,

659
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:54,870
you know?

660
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,390
I'm under so much stress.

661
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,460
I'm so scared.

662
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,780
No, Daji.

663
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,740
It won't happen.

664
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,300
No, it won't.

665
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,350
What are you two doing so late in there?

666
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,260
Mrs. Dai.

667
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,190
Are you fighting again?

668
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,020
No.

669
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,590
Mom, we're brushing our teeth.

670
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,780
We're washing up, Mrs. Dai.

671
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,500
Are you fighting again?

672
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:17,300
No.

673
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,670
Come out.

674
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,700
I need the bathroom.

675
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,430
Sure. Right away.

676
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,150
You can use it now.

677
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,060
We're done, Mrs. Dai.

678
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,390
You're going to get the results, right?

679
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,640
Whether it's serious or not,
we'll have to listen to the doctor.

680
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,670
I can go with you.

681
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,430
No. You better pretend you don't know.

682
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,360
- It's fine.
- Mom.

683
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,640
- Come have breakfast.
- Mrs. Dai.

684
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:57,880
Breakfast is ready.

685
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,740
Come here, two of you.

686
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,780
I need to talk to you.

687
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,540
How about some buns?

688
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,460
Buns.

689
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,060
Daji.

690
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:10,980
Sit.

691
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,020
What's wrong?

692
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,350
Come and sit.

693
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,220
Zhou Shui, sit.

694
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,670
Are we having a meeting?

695
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,830
Why so serious?

696
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,190
This is

697
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,460
the money you paid

698
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,830
for my medical bills.

699
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,020
Take it.

700
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,110
What medical bills, Mrs. Dai?

701
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,700
Stop pretending. I heard everything.

702
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:42,540
I told you to keep it from him,
but you just can't keep it quiet.

703
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,220
Mrs. Dai, actually, you don't have
to ask Daji to hide it from me.

704
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,500
The thing you're worried about
won't happen.

705
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,110
Take it.

706
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,260
What are you doing?

707
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,150
We can afford the money.

708
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,190
Enough.

709
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,590
No need to hesitate.

710
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,390
Take the money.

711
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,150
I have money.

712
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:04,670
These are

713
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,500
my bankbooks.

714
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:13,350
My savings from the past few decades.
It's quite a big sum.

715
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,460
What are you doing?

716
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,000
The results aren't out yet.

717
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,350
You're acting like

718
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,400
you're leaving a will.

719
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:19,980
Put them away.

720
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,910
Let me finish.

721
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,150
This isn't confirmed yet.

722
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,150
You're being ridiculous.

723
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,020
Dai Daji!

724
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,220
Sit down.

725
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,630
You never listened to me
since you were a kid.

726
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,300
I must tell you this today.

727
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,910
This account is under your name.

728
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,670
Dai Daji. Three-year fixed deposit.

729
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,020
The password is your birthday.

730
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,150
Mrs. Dai, maybe I should...

731
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:52,870
Sit down.

732
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:55,800
These are

733
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,087
(Property Deed)
the deeds to my three houses

734
00:32:58,088 --> 00:32:58,910
in my hometown.

735
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,950
I checked with the Bureau of Real Estate.

736
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,500
You just need to pay 90 yuan

737
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,190
to transfer each deed to your name.

738
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,350
Zhou Shui,

739
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,590
I have something for you too.

740
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,430
Promise me

741
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,870
you'll keep it safe

742
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,540
and pass it down.

743
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,350
A heirloom?

744
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:21,590
No, Mrs. Dai.

745
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,670
I don't want your money.

746
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,190
I'm not giving you money.

747
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,460
This...

748
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:44,350
(Delicious and slimming bean sprouts)

749
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,880
(Eat less iodine-rich food)
Look at this.

750
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,260
This notebook

751
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,660
(Try making grape wine at home)

752
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,980
records all of Daji's favorites
since she was a kid.

753
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,700
Braised bamboo shoots, xiaolongbao,
and marinated eggs.

754
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,220
Look at this.

755
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,020
On May 19, 1998,

756
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,670
Dai Daji got first place in her grade,

757
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,780
and I made her braised pork.

758
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:05,590
All these years,
her favorite foods are written in here.

759
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,100
I wrote down every ingredient

760
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:08,980
and step clearly.

761
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,350
Don't ask me again.

762
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,140
The way to make carp dish soup
turn white,

763
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,660
I marked it in red for you.

764
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,830
Why are you teaching him that?

765
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,460
It's not that you can't cook anymore.

766
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,350
I can't cook for you forever.

767
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,310
Why not?

768
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,620
I just want you to know

769
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,910
that you don't have to be afraid.

770
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:32,660
You have everything you need.

771
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,980
If you want to stay in Beijing,

772
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:38,950
these three houses are more than
enough for you

773
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,180
to trade for a place of your own.

774
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,580
If you don't want to stay,

775
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:45,620
these deeds and bankbooks

776
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:49,430
are my protection for you.

777
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,830
They'll back you up.

778
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:52,950
All right?

779
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:56,870
Mom, can we not talk about this?

780
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,950
Why are you crying, silly girl?

781
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,180
I'm scared, Mom.

782
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,870
Stop talking about this. Please.

783
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,100
Silly girl, no need to cry.
You look so pretty even when you cry.

784
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,540
Am I right, my girl?

785
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,390
Can we not talk about this anymore?
Please.

786
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,140
I... I thought about it
all night yesterday.

787
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,580
I even write it all down.

788
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,830
Zhou Shui, listen.

789
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,310
Don't fight,

790
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,270
don't stay up late.

791
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,790
You'll regret it when you get older.

792
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,620
Remember to get regular check-ups.

793
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,430
You need to

794
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,580
look after her as a girl, all right?

795
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,710
Keep an eye on her

796
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,710
and make sure she doesn't eat
random things outside.

797
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,620
Follow the recipes here

798
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,270
when you cook her favorite food.

799
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:43,500
Also,

800
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,270
Daji,

801
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,100
it's normal for married couples

802
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:50,360
to have arguments.

803
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,180
Don't always be bigoted
on who's right or wrong.

804
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:53,920
Life goes on,

805
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,230
and being right or wrong
doesn't matter much in the long run.

806
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,910
We're not even married yet.

807
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,750
I know you too well.

808
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,950
You're my girl.
I can see it in the way you look at him.

809
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,430
Stop crying.

810
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:07,980
Go

811
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,980
and get your fancy makeup

812
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,660
for me.

813
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,430
I need it.

814
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,000
That lipstick of yours costs hundreds,
I've never used anything like that.

815
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,620
Hurry up.

816
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:25,580
Zhou Shui,

817
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,180
these are

818
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,180
all of my savings.

819
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,230
Everything is here.

820
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,460
They're also Daji's dowry.

821
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:39,620
I just hope

822
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,980
you can treat her well.

823
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,710
I really worry about her.

824
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,430
Don't worry, Mrs. Dai.

825
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,100
I promise you.

826
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,350
The next time you visit,

827
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,230
we'll be back in Beijing.

828
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,100
I'll work hard

829
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,710
and buy her a big house

830
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:04,870
and a nice car.

831
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:08,180
I mean it.

832
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,310
I believe you.

833
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,790
You two being together happily

834
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,140
is my greatest wish.

835
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:15,830
Really.

836
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,350
I don't have the right

837
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,750
to accept these for Daji.

838
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,230
But I'll keep this well.

839
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:37,980
Thank you, Mrs. Dai.

840
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:52,620
Doctor,

841
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,430
how's the result?

842
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,790
It's neither bad nor good.

843
00:37:59,390 --> 00:37:59,980
Wait.

844
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,540
What does that mean?

845
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,580
Not bad means

846
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,790
it's not a malignant tumor.

847
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,390
But

848
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,580
it's a rare condition.

849
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,540
It's cystitis glandularis.

850
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,910
It can only be controlled, not cured.

851
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,870
Besides, it might turn into cancer.

852
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,270
In the future,

853
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,950
come back for check-ups
every six months.

854
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,460
Take good care of your mom.

855
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,350
Get yourself together.

856
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:35,830
Mrs. Dai.

857
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,580
How is it?

858
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,430
Xiaoya,

859
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,580
I'm officially informing you

860
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,750
to take back

861
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,180
all those little bankbooks and deeds.

862
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,460
What do you mean?

863
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,100
What do I mean?

864
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,580
Nothing to worry about.

865
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,710
Really?

866
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,680
You can't read the report.

867
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,240
The doctor said it was nothing,
Mrs. Dai.

868
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,870
Right. The doctor said it was fine.

869
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,100
Really?

870
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,310
Yes, I'm not lying.

871
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,910
I told you it was fine.

872
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,910
You shouldn't have been anxious
all these days.

873
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,040
It's my fault, all right?

874
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,040
I told you I'd be all right.
Isn't it, Zhou Shui?

875
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,270
Yes.

876
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,350
Xiaoya is always fine.

877
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,580
Right.

878
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,980
Let's go buy groceries.

879
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,910
I'm going to cook you
a good meal tonight,

880
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:14,310
all right?

881
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:14,870
- Sure.
- Sure.

882
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:15,720
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

883
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,790
I have 30,000 in my fixed deposit

884
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:28,980
and 7,000 on my card.

885
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,020
What about you?

886
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,060
Here are 200

887
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,430
and 4,700.

888
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,140
There are less than 5,000 in total.

889
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:38,180
We'll withdraw the money tomorrow.

890
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,270
We'll pay him back.

891
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,180
I don't take it out. Keep the money.

892
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,240
What can we do
if we don't withdraw the money?

893
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,750
Do you know how expensive his car is?

894
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,100
Our money

895
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:51,540
probably won't be enough
to pay for one door.

896
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:52,980
He's so rich,

897
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,540
why would he care about our money?

898
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,350
What can he do if we won't fix his car?

899
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,020
He won't let us off if we don't fix it.

900
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:03,660
Let's leave.

901
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,180
Leave? Where are we going?

902
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,360
Anywhere.
As long as it's away from Beijing,

903
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,880
we can hide out somewhere for a while.

904
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,390
I'm sure he'll forget about it
after two years.

905
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,020
Dumbbell,

906
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,020
if we leave Beijing now,

907
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,480
I wouldn't come back

908
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,100
when I left Chunzhili Residence
back then.

909
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,500
You promised me

910
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,620
that we'd stay together in Beijing.

911
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,140
Or else what have we been doing
these two years?

912
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,180
What do we do, then?

913
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,180
I'll take responsibility.
I'll pay for the car repair, Mr. Liao.

914
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,710
It's just a car.

915
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,140
I don't care about that.

916
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,180
What I care about is your health.

917
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,710
Is the wound better?

918
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,790
Sorry, Mr. Liao.

919
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,140
I'll compensate you,
no matter how much it is.

920
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,710
He's a lame guy.

921
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,270
You're out of his league.

922
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,830
Please don't disparage my boyfriend.

923
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,430
He's a good person. He treats me well.

924
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,660
What's so good about him?

925
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,720
He worked hard to earn money
and helped me

926
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,350
when I was going through
my toughest time.

927
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,710
So I'm very grateful and cherish him.

928
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,460
I'll never betray him.

929
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,710
Gratitude comes in many ways.

930
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,870
Do you think giving yourself to him
out of gratitude is love?

931
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,390
You're just repaying him.

932
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,350
You're a smart girl.
How can you not see that?

933
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:36,960
Here are my suggestions.

934
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,750
I'll give him back ten times

935
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,180
the amount he gave you.

936
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,350
Don't overthink it.

937
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,580
I'm not asking you
to give yourself to me.

938
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:45,560
I just don't want

939
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,270
a girl like you
to lower yourself like that.

940
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:52,580
Mr. Liao,

941
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,430
not everything can be bought with money.

942
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:58,830
My boyfriend will
never leave me for money.

943
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,230
Have some tea.

944
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,430
Green tea.

945
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:06,540
It's worth savoring.

946
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:14,620
Mr. Liao,

947
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:16,750
you're in big business,

948
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,060
so you must be a smart person.

949
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,180
Don't waste your time and money

950
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,270
on people like us.

951
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,620
You have so many sides to be discovered.

952
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,310
I never noticed someone as weak as you

953
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,580
have such a personality and temper.

954
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:33,100
Jingshu,

955
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,350
dare you make a bet with me?

956
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:37,830
If you win,

957
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,710
the car repair expense will be waived.

958
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,910
We'll call it even.

959
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,180
What do you want to bet?

960
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:51,310
Let's bet on whether love

961
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,100
or human nature will win.
