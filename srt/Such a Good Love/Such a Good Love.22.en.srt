00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,070
(Autumn 2016)
Fortune Real Estate proposal is done. Print it now.

4
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,940
(Beijing)
Got it.

5
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,300
Ask them to make the first payment.

6
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:55,990
I need money now.

7
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,677
They'll pay

8
00:01:56,678 --> 00:01:57,640
by Friday at the latest.

9
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,790
Hello, Ms. Zhu.

10
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,870
I'd like to ask about

11
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,300
the apartment I'm interested in.

12
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,070
I'll come by to leave a deposit
this weekend.

13
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,380
Can you reserve it for me?

14
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,100
Hello, Ms. Liu.

15
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:07,740
Hello.

16
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,470
I'm wondering if you have time tomorrow.

17
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,470
We'd like to try on
wedding dresses and suits.

18
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,260
Thank you.

19
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,820
Shui,

20
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,580
you're really done with movies?

21
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,660
Have you made up your mind?

22
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,510
All right.

23
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,470
Since you've decided,

24
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,470
we can start looking for
reference movies.

25
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,860
- I think romance movies should be...
- Daji.

26
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,790
If I choose not to make movies,

27
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,510
would you look down on me?

28
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,540
No.

29
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,750
What I want to do now

30
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,630
is to get one million,

31
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,380
buy a house, and get married with her.

32
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,630
I want to take responsibility
like a man.

33
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,030
Hurry up.

34
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,420
Miss, your husband has fine taste.

35
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,260
Everything he's picked for you
is custom-made.

36
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,860
Besides, not many successful husbands

37
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,510
would have time to accompany their wives

38
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,950
to try on wedding dresses as he did.

39
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,100
Your husband loves you very much.

40
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,310
It's ready.

41
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,380
Okay.

42
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,630
Sorry,

43
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,670
we've given you

44
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,900
the best discount.

45
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,020
Well, then. I'll pay the deposit.

46
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,340
20,000, right?

47
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,550
Let me confirm.

48
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,580
If I order the bridesmaid

49
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,630
and groomsmen outfits here,

50
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,630
could you offer a discount
on the main dress?

51
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,510
- Sorry.
- No?

52
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,430
All right.

53
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,540
Well, another thing.

54
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,380
(Bridesmaid and groomsmen)
Before December 12,

55
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,990
can the size be adjusted?

56
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:01,990
No problem.

57
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,430
Okay.

58
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,140
All right, that's it.

59
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,780
I'll pay the deposit now.

60
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,340
Credit card?

61
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:06,950
Yes.

62
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,260
Sure.

63
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:07,630
Here.

64
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:09,700
Here.

65
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,380
I always thought

66
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,780
that when you wear the wedding dress,

67
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,820
I should be the first one
to hold your hand.

68
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,820
Daji, where are you?

69
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,820
I'm ready to pay the apartment deposit.

70
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,260
I'm here. Hurry up and come.

71
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,110
Mr. Zhou, you seem to have
taken the wrong card.

72
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,550
What do you mean?

73
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,430
It didn't go through.

74
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,190
Try again.

75
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,700
Sure.

76
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,990
It's still not working.

77
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,220
That can't be.

78
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,900
I just transferred a million
this morning.

79
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,310
Try again.

80
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,550
Wait. I'll make a call.

81
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,140
Sure.

82
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:38,900
Thank you.

83
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:45,750
No need to call.

84
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,190
I've refunded the money.

85
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,140
What do you mean?

86
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,340
I turned down the ad.

87
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,780
You turned it down?

88
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,700
Wait,

89
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,700
why didn't you discuss it with me?

90
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,780
When was this?

91
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,110
Why did you do this?

92
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,260
Let's go somewhere else.

93
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,870
Not here.

94
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,070
Where are we going?

95
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,430
Home.

96
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,510
Not the one we're living in now.

97
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,460
The place we lived

98
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:36,900
when we first came to Beijing.

99
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,920
(Chunzhili Residence No. 4 Building)

100
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:02,950
They're moving.

101
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,630
The door is open.

102
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:11,950
No one here?

103
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,900
Why is everything gone?

104
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,220
It has become like this.

105
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,020
Seems it's been empty for a while.

106
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,510
Old Chives's room.

107
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,030
Let's look around.

108
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,100
That's Dong's.

109
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,430
Is it?

110
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,030
The posters are still there.

111
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,220
Do you think the people
who lived here after us

112
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,460
were also trying to make a living

113
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,620
in Beijing?

114
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,430
Their living conditions
should be much better.

115
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,620
There's an air-conditioner.

116
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,950
I didn't notice that.

117
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,220
Old Chives has one too.

118
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,910
Dumbbell's room.

119
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
The upper bunk is gone.

120
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,340
Why does the room feel smaller

121
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,700
without the furniture?

122
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,580
Was the light always this low?

123
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,500
Zhou Shui, look.

124
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,700
It's still here.

125
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,700
My vanity mirror.

126
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,700
The mirror is cracked.

127
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,030
Yeah, that's why no one wanted it.

128
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,620
So can we talk now?

129
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,980
Let's talk.

130
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,980
Why did you turn it down?

131
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,030
What were you thinking?

132
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,430
I don't want to
buy the house anymore,

133
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,430
so there's no need for the ad.

134
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,390
Not buying a house?

135
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,270
Then how are we getting married?

136
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,790
Then let's not get married.

137
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,030
I want you to make movies.

138
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,190
Why can't we do both?

139
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,070
We can buy a house and get married

140
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,910
before we make a movie.

141
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,100
But do you think we can get married now?

142
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,390
Do we still love each other
like we did before?

143
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,820
What's the point of getting married

144
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,310
if there's no more love?

145
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,670
Think about it.

146
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,790
We've only been talking about work

147
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,580
and the slides,

148
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,670
but nothing else.

149
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,920
That's because we haven't figured out
the work, slides,

150
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,390
and the house stuff.

151
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,860
Do we have time for other things?

152
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,190
Do you realize

153
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,190
that in the past months,

154
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,100
we haven't had
a single nice meal together,

155
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,190
gone to see a movie,

156
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,620
or even slept together?

157
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,030
Daji, I...

158
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,500
I promised your mom

159
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,220
that I'd buy a house

160
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:43,980
and marry you

161
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,030
by the end of the year.

162
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,270
I can't afford to break the promise now.

163
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,100
You also promised me.

164
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,390
You said

165
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,500
when I wear the wedding dress,

166
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,070
you should be the first one
to hold my hand.

167
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,670
I wore the wedding dress yesterday,

168
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,460
but what were you doing?

169
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,860
You were counting money.

170
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,310
I was paying the bill, Daji.

171
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,820
Daji, we're thirty now.

172
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,670
Let's stop being childish, okay?

173
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,190
Fine, I'm childish.

174
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,070
Then tell me what being mature means.

175
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:22,980
Being mature

176
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,860
is that we have to give up some things.

177
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,910
It means doing the right thing

178
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,790
at the right time.

179
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,340
Being mature means facing reality.

180
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,460
In reality, feelings

181
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,340
can't stay the same forever, right?

182
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,620
In that case, I'm not mature.

183
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,150
Because I can't accept this.

184
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,950
We fell in love because of movies.

185
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,030
I feel like we've almost
forgotten our dreams.

186
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,670
And our love too.

187
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,430
What's the point of a marriage

188
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,950
where love isn't there anymore?

189
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,460
But isn't that how everyone is?

190
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,270
I don't care about everyone else.

191
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,070
I just don't want this kind of life.

192
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,430
I must try one more time.

193
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,100
Once more.

194
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,820
With all my might.

195
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,100
If I can find my dreams,

196
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,220
my love will come back.

197
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,820
Have you made up your mind?

198
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,270
Tomorrow.

199
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,100
I'll return the money for the ad.

200
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,340
Daji.

201
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,740
Let me ask you one last thing.

202
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,310
Is this worth it?

203
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,790
I just don't want to forget why

204
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,270
we came to Beijing.

205
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,100
The neon sign "Welcome to Beijing"
has been removed.

206
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,790
There's been such a big change.

207
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,190
Are you breaking up with me?

208
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,390
It won't change anything.

209
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,580
Earlier, you said

210
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,670
you didn't want to get married.

211
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,190
Are you serious about that?

212
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,860
Anyway, I want to marry you.

213
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,390
When you broke into my room
with a hammer,

214
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,670
when we lay on the frozen Shichahai,

215
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,100
when we set off fireworks in 2008

216
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,820
and got chased,

217
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,500
since the day we met,

218
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,500
I've always believed

219
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,220
that we were meant to get married.

220
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,390
When we had nothing,

221
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,670
we held on to each other.

222
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,620
Now that things are looking up,

223
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,430
we have no reason to
leave each other, right?

224
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,270
It's October 18, 2016,

225
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,270
under the witness of the moon...

226
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,100
Hold on.

227
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,390
The sun is still up.

228
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,030
Under the witness of the sun.

229
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,670
Marry me, Daji.

230
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,980
I don't want to.

231
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,070
I'll wait until you do.

232
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,550
Suit yourself. I...

233
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,500
I don't want

234
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,700
to say yes so easily, do you understand?

235
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,220
This isn't how it's supposed to be.

236
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,670
I like dramatic things.

237
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,670
I imagine it happening

238
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,390
at a movie premiere,

239
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,980
with a large crowd
of media and audience.

240
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,630
On stage, you pull out

241
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,830
a massive five-carat diamond ring
and propose to me.

242
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,830
And the next day,

243
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,390
we make the front page.

244
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:16,980
So I've decided

245
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,220
we're not getting married.

246
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,430
Let's make movies.

247
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:36,590
Zhou Shui,

248
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,740
buying a house or getting married

249
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,020
was never what we wanted, was it?

250
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,260
We didn't come to Beijing

251
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,630
for that.

252
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,300
Have you forgotten your dream,
Zhou Shui?

253
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,500
Look at me. Look at us.

254
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,700
We shine.

255
00:18:00,508 --> 00:18:02,300
You know what I mean.

256
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,870
Actually, I understand

257
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,590
what she's doing now
isn't just about making movies,

258
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,590
it's about saving our love.

259
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,020
But at this moment, I flinch.

260
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,500
Because I don't know what we will face

261
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,430
if we give up everything.

262
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,060
But I have no choice.

263
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,300
Because making movies

264
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,980
is our last attempt

265
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,700
to save our love.

266
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,670
Our final fight.

267
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,110
Daji.

268
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,700
Will we get married?

269
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,300
Let's make a movie first.

270
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,590
I love you.

271
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,590
No need to thank me.

272
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,300
(2016,)

273
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,300
(China's film market is on a roll.)

274
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,590
(Once again, we stand)

275
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,840
(at a crossroads in life.)

276
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,420
(6.1 billion box office)
More good news

277
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:49,760
(within 23 days)
from film industry.

278
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,740
As of December 20,

279
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,300
(10 billion)
total box office earnings

280
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,938
(in 54 days)
have exceeded 44 billion.

281
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,060
"The Mermaid" was a huge success,

282
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,530
(Surpasses 3 billion)
with box office revenue of 3.39 billion.

283
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,430
(At that time,
I didn't know how this choice)

284
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,580
(would affect our love.)

285
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,260
(41,093 movie screens
across the country)

286
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,440
(But the tide of the times
like a pair of big hands)

287
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,500
(1.373 billion moviegoers)

288
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,600
(shoves us forward without turning back.)

289
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,680
(China's Box Office Growth)

290
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,950
(Summer 2024 total box office earnings)

291
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,340
(Autumn 2024, Beijing)
(falls by 43.6 percent from last year.)

292
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,860
- (The moviegoers are down by 100 million.)
- Are you moving? Oh my goodness.

293
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,980
I can't handle this alone.

294
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,780
Give me a hand.

295
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,630
Pack those stuff.

296
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,150
Are you moving in with Mr. Zhang?

297
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,500
Come on. I'm moving downstairs.

298
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,910
My landlord suddenly decides

299
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:38,910
to sell this place,

300
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:39,910
so I have to move.

301
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,500
Luckily, there's

302
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,780
an empty one downstairs.

303
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,060
Didn't you buy a place in Beijing?

304
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,150
I thought about it.

305
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,390
Back in 2016,

306
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,430
I was planning to buy a place
with someone

307
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,390
and settle down.

308
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,060
We had the money ready,

309
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,740
but in the end, I gave up.

310
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,590
After that, I didn't see the point
of buying one.

311
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,540
I can live where I want.

312
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,780
It's not really home, anyway.

313
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,150
Ms. Juan, Sansan, Mr. Zhou.

314
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:08,870
Su.

315
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,540
Su, what are you doing here?

316
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,060
I'm picking up my girlfriend.

317
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,430
She works here.

318
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,110
She's a teacher here. She's over there.

319
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,150
We've met before.

320
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,220
Oh, right.

321
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,110
Your girlfriend is a teacher here?

322
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,740
Right.

323
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,540
And you?

324
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,540
Does your kid study here?

325
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,220
See? Another misunderstanding.

326
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,300
Sansan is my kid.

327
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,300
Not Zhou's.

328
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,110
I'm Sansan's dad.

329
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,540
Right, Sansan?

330
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,700
Mr. Zhou.

331
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,630
Sansan is starting elementary school
next year,

332
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,780
so we're enrolling him in a prep class

333
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,760
to give him a head start.

334
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,300
Or it might be hard for him to keep up.

335
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,300
Zhou thought the enrollment
was important,

336
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,540
so he came along.

337
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,110
The line over there is long.

338
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,740
We haven't even seen the teacher yet.

339
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,700
Juan,

340
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,060
take Sansan to look around.

341
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,500
Sure.

342
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,500
I'll talk to Su.

343
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,430
Okay, go on.

344
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,220
Okay.

345
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:53,830
Let's go.

346
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:54,950
Su.

347
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:55,590
Yes?

348
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,830
I'm sorry about this.

349
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,190
Your girlfriend is a teacher
here, right?

350
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,190
Could you help me ask
if there's a spot for us?

351
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,830
Sure, no problem, Mr. Zhou.

352
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,500
I'll talk to her later.

353
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,910
Thank you so much.

354
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,300
But I have a question, Mr. Zhou.

355
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:11,980
Go on.

356
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,300
Ms. Juan isn't your wife,

357
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,060
and Sansan isn't your kid.

358
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,110
But why are you so involved?

359
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,630
Well,

360
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,020
friends should be loyal.

361
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,060
I need to take care of them.

362
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:32,830
Speaking of which,

363
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,020
Yun City Hua Mansion you mentioned

364
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,700
cost 30,000 yuan
per square meter back then.

365
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,500
We had the money ready,

366
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,910
but then I gave up.

367
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,830
Now, it costs 80,000 yuan
per square meter.

368
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,910
If you had bought
a two-bedroom apartment back then,

369
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,910
it's gone up by six million,
you know?

370
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,020
That much?

371
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,500
What were you thinking at that time?

372
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,060
What was I thinking?

373
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,300
I chose love

374
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,500
over the house.

375
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,630
What kind of love is worth six million?

376
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,020
Your love costs dearly.

377
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,060
Love is a bad investment.

378
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,260
You can't calculate it.

379
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,260
But if you don't,

380
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,630
how do you know if it was worth it?

381
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,390
I brought in Ms. Chao for you,

382
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,110
the queen who produced

383
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,460
countless hit idol dramas.

384
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,220
Skip the pleasantries.
Let's get straight to the point.

385
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,020
Have a seat.

386
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,020
Hello.

387
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,110
(Such a Good Love!)

388
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:33,390
Mr. Man said you wrote this script.

389
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,780
Yes, I wrote it.

390
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,780
To be honest, I only read it
for ten minutes.

391
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,460
I couldn't finish reading it.

392
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,220
What's wrong with it?

393
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,430
Can I ask you a question?

394
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,150
Yes, please.

395
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,190
What's your surname?

396
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,350
Zhou.

397
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,020
Your surname is Zhou, right?

398
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,020
So, you think you can make comedies

399
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,740
just like Stephen Chow?

400
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,350
Stephen Chow tells stories
about underdogs

401
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,980
from the lowest rung of society,
that's real comedy.

402
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,190
But yours

403
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,950
is just crude and lowbrow.

404
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,630
- Ms. Chao,
- Ms. Chao.

405
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:12,150
this is a true story.

406
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,950
Who are you? An assistant?

407
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,870
My girlfriend.

408
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,500
The script

409
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,110
is based on our real story.

410
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,150
- It's real.
- Hold on.

411
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,390
Ruidi brought me in as a producer

412
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,590
because I'm the queen of idol dramas.

413
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,870
Because I have fine taste, okay?

414
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,630
And now you give me

415
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,190
such a lame script.

416
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:31,060
Are you trying to ruin me?

417
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,350
Haven't you seen my work?

418
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,390
I watched "CEO, Don't Love Me."

419
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,540
Very well.

420
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,590
What did you feel

421
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,150
when the hero and heroine

422
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,950
finally got together?

423
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:45,950
Because...

424
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,910
Because I only watched
the first ten minutes,

425
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:48,830
I... I'm not sure...

426
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,500
Forget it.

427
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,150
You just don't get it.

428
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,830
If you want to make this movie,
make it into an idol romance.

429
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,110
That's final.

430
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,950
Ms. Chao, this isn't an idol romance.

431
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,020
We want to

432
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,190
make it

433
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:08,980
more realistic.

434
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,980
You can change it.

435
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,540
How?

436
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,300
You don't know how to change a script?

437
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,700
How can you be a director?

438
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,590
Can't you write a romance?

439
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,540
Cast a handsome guy and a pretty girl,

440
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,300
have them fall in love,

441
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,950
and include some catfights
between women.

442
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,430
Everyone loves that stuff.

443
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,180
Come on. You're young people.

444
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,150
But Ms. Chao,

445
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,020
the company approved this script.

446
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,770
If we start over...

447
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:38,540
Excuse me.

448
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,700
I'm the executive producer.

449
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,460
Who's got more success,

450
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,980
you or me?

451
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,780
Ms. Chao.

452
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,110
You're the producer,

453
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,430
but we're the ones making it.

454
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,190
Oh, come on.

455
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,350
This is a 20-million production.

456
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,300
Go out and ask

457
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,700
who's playing this as a game with you.

458
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:56,700
Man Jiaxin,

459
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,300
you're Ruidi's producer.
What do you say?

460
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,500
We listen to Ms. Chao.

461
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,780
How much have you written?

462
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,590
Zero.

463
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:23,980
What's going on?

464
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,260
Daji, how do we write a romance?

465
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,500
You're asking me?

466
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,780
Look at me

467
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,910
and look at you.

468
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,150
Are we even idols?

469
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,020
Do we know how to write one?

470
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,500
I really can't do this.

471
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,700
You can still try.

472
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,260
Really?

473
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,350
Maybe we can find some inspiration.

474
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,220
How?

475
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,950
It's a love story.

476
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,740
Let's try something exciting.

477
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,540
Good idea. Let's start.

478
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,950
Wait. Wait. I was joking.

479
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,150
Stop it.

480
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,780
Hold on. This line is good.

481
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,150
You like that?

482
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,020
No.

483
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,430
This line has the vibe.

484
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,260
"Stop it."

485
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,780
Stop... Stop it.

486
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,300
It feels a bit like a romance drama.

487
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:06,980
Is it?

488
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,260
Something's wrong with our accent.

489
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,060
Stand up.

490
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,430
Now,

491
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,350
try to express your feelings

492
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,700
in the accent of a romance drama.

493
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,950
I'm so mad right now!

494
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,950
I can't stand it anymore!

495
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,060
She's just yelling at us every day.

496
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,740
- My head hurts!
- My head hurts!

497
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:29,980
We're getting it.

498
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,700
That's it!

499
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,150
- That's it.
- That's the thing.

500
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,220
- Okay.
- Let's talk.

501
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:33,870
Talk.

502
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:34,630
Shui.

503
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:38,190
Look at this fruit. What a sweetie.

504
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,060
But it's nowhere near as sweet as you.

505
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,870
Oh, it's so embarrassing.

506
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,260
If you keep talking like that.

507
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,950
This pear looks pretty nice too.

508
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,590
But it's not as pretty as you.

509
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,740
I'm going to jump.

510
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,500
- Gosh.
- No!

511
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,740
Let's figure something out.

512
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:56,740
It's disgusting.

513
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,780
So disgusting.

514
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,540
I can't stand it.

515
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,950
So gross.

516
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,300
I'm disgusted with myself now.

517
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,220
I can't change my accent back.

518
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,740
Darn it.

519
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,460
Please.

520
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,630
Why did you make a love story so poor?

521
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,540
- Poor?
- Poor?

522
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:30,150
The hero just lights some fireworks
for the heroine,

523
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,300
and it's romantic and moving?

524
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,260
I think it's moving.

525
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,060
So moving.

526
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,060
If we're writing fireworks scenes,

527
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,910
they should light up the whole sky,

528
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,430
not just a sparkler.

529
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,980
Is the crew short on money?

530
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,630
Ms. Chao, we were pretty poor.

531
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,260
Yeah.

532
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,260
Fine.

533
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,590
Fireworks are fine.

534
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,260
But the security guards coming out

535
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,260
of nowhere to chase them.

536
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,060
Is that romantic? Is that moving?

537
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,500
Well, the security guards

538
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,350
actually appeared that day.

539
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,910
- They were chasing us.
- Right.

540
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:58,590
Fine.

541
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,150
How much do you earn a year now?

542
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,500
- 100,000 or so.
- Around 100,000.

543
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,190
- It should be 200,000.
- Yeah.

544
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:05,870
I think so.

545
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,870
That's why they can't write
a rich scene.

546
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,910
Too poor for that.

547
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:14,950
Well.

548
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:18,150
Let me show you
how romance scenes should be done.

549
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,260
Imagine

550
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,260
you're in a European castle.

551
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,220
The hero lights up fireworks

552
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,670
that illuminate the whole city

553
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,910
for the heroine.

554
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:31,780
Come.

555
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,630
Stand up.

556
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:34,780
You're the prince.

557
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,670
You're the princess.

558
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:37,910
Come on. Stand up.

559
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,350
These fireworks

560
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:42,220
light up your beautiful
haute couture gown.

561
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,590
It's a Dior handmade gown.

562
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,460
Then, you hold each other and kiss.

563
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,190
Hug and kiss.

564
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,390
Here?

565
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,780
Well.

566
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,460
You can hold hands and spin in circles.

567
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,260
Do as Ms. Chao says. Like this.

568
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,150
Yes, spin around.

569
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,390
Then, the camera follows you,

570
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,950
spinning 360 degrees.

571
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,590
Got it?

572
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,300
Got it?

573
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,430
Got it?

574
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,300
No.

575
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,700
- Let me try again.
- Try again.

576
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,630
I didn't get it.

577
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:15,540
- Try again.
- Again.

578
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,500
Hey, the girlfriend,

579
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,540
let me ask you. If you were the heroine,

580
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,020
what would you do

581
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,950
if it started raining?

582
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,340
Raining?

583
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,950
- It's raining.
- Let's get an umbrella.

584
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:23,690
Don't catch a cold.

585
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:23,890
Yeah.

586
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,300
No! You should be out there
and play in the rain.

587
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,740
We might catch a cold.

588
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,220
What's wrong with

589
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,220
the young people now?

590
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,540
Back then, when I saw rain,

591
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,300
I'd definitely

592
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,670
run out and spin in the rain.

593
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,980
Come. It's raining now.

594
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,910
Try it.

595
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,190
What if we catch a cold?

596
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,190
Spin in the rain.

597
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,110
Come. Follow me.

598
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,460
Like this. Play with the rain.

599
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,060
Yes. Like this.

600
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,150
Right. Come on.

601
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,300
Spin in circles. Go. Spin.

602
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,350
Like it. Enjoy it.

603
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:51,950
Yes.

604
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,110
Exactly. Come.

605
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,830
Yes! Spin.

606
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,190
Spin.

607
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:00,830
Spin in circles.

608
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,300
Come. Spin in circles.

609
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,220
Spin.

610
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,950
Come on.

611
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,630
Spin.

612
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,740
Is it starting to feel like rain now?

613
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,870
Yes.

614
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,780
- Stomp in the puddles.
- Spin.

615
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,540
Don't laugh.

616
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,830
You ruined the romantic atmosphere.

617
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,120
How are we going to write now?

618
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,740
I'm sorry, Ms. Chao.

619
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,430
I really can't imagine

620
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,780
scenes like this.

621
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,300
I really can't.

622
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,020
I get it now.

623
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,780
You can't write the hero's part

624
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,590
because you're too ugly.

625
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,390
You write the supporting roles.

626
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,700
Director's girlfriend.

627
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,700
My name is Dai Daji.

628
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,260
Whatever.

629
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:37,110
From now on, I'll write the hero's part.

630
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,500
You write the heroine's.

631
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,540
And those annoying

632
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:43,110
and ugly supporting roles,

633
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:43,870
he'll cover that.

634
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,220
Besides, when we discuss

635
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,350
the main roles,

636
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,350
you don't have to join.

637
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,220
You can stay home and figure out

638
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,430
how to make the supporting roles

639
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,980
more annoying. Okay?

640
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,060
How's it going?

641
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,910
I still have an ending to write.

642
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,500
Do you want to read it?

643
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,870
Not really.

644
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,150
Do you think what we've written now

645
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,780
is still our story?

646
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:28,910
Well.

647
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,830
Now,

648
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:33,020
I'm Dai Daji from 2025.

649
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,540
I'll tell you clearly

650
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,950
that your idol romance movie

651
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,830
will receive tons of good reviews.

652
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,740
It'll earn 500 million.

653
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,060
A super big hit.

654
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,950
And you'll become

655
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,260
the most influential

656
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,190
and promising new director.

657
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,910
What would you choose?

658
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,460
Yu,

659
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,190
your salary
for the next three months.

660
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,220
Take it now.

661
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,690
After we finish the film,

662
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:22,740
if you're still interested,

663
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,220
we can work together.

664
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:25,670
Thank you, Ji.

665
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,190
Shui, didn't your script get approved?

666
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,500
Why the long face?

667
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,740
Approved?

668
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,740
There's no time left,
and it needs to be pushed forward.

669
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,980
Ms. Chao never approved

670
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,700
the script.

671
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,190
As long as it's making progress.

672
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:40,910
It's a good thing.

673
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:43,500
Ji, Shui, you're about to
shoot the movie.

674
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,740
That's so enviable.

675
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,590
Right, Director Zhou.

676
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,910
We're about to shoot the movie.

677
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:49,910
Get excited.

678
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,150
Right.

679
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,630
We're making a movie.

680
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,910
No matter what, we're shooting a movie,

681
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:57,910
right?

682
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,700
Yes.

683
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,781
- Get excited.
- Get excited.

684
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:01,560
Get excited.

685
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:06,300
Director Zhou,
since we've built the team,

686
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,310
shouldn't the main crew
be confirmed now?

687
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,500
There's no need for that.

688
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:14,310
- You mean the Useless Five?
- The Useless Five!

689
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:17,500
Ze! The Useless Five...

690
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:18,910
You're here.

691
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:20,950
What?

692
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:21,710
What's going on?

693
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,460
Didn't you say
the main crew is all here?

694
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,940
Yeah. the cinematographer,
art director, and editor are here.

695
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:26,390
No.

696
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,020
No. We don't know them.

697
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,540
They aren't the people on the list.

698
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,020
Let me see the list.

699
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:31,910
Give it to me.

700
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,790
Nothing's wrong with it. Read it.

701
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:35,910
Are you kidding me?

702
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:36,660
No, it's not.

703
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,390
Our director of photography
is Xue Cheng,

704
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,540
not Huang Lian.

705
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,100
Yeah. Also,

706
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,230
our editor is Xiaomao. Li Xiaomao.

707
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:44,500
Our assistant director

708
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,180
should be Ze. Lin Ze.

709
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,430
Any problem, directors?

710
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:50,580
Ms. Chao, why did you change
our main crew?

711
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,350
What do you mean by that?

712
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,350
They're all my friends.

713
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,270
Come. Let me introduce you to the team.

714
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,140
The team in front of you now

715
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:01,060
is the top-tier team
in Chinese youth movies.

716
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,660
I specially brought in William Huang,

717
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,560
from Hong Kong, China.

718
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,580
He's worked on a lot of box-office hits.

719
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,140
Everyone here has worked on
at least ten movies.

720
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,020
How many movies

721
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,100
have your friends worked on?

722
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,350
I'm telling you,

723
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,910
our production team is efficient

724
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,350
and professional.

725
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,390
They're not playing games here.

726
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,430
Understand?

727
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,350
Xiaomao, I'm truly sorry.

728
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,620
So sorry, Xue Cheng.

729
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,270
Really sorry.

730
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:28,790
You see,

731
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:31,140
I never thought they'd so blatantly

732
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,020
go back on their word.

733
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,710
Director Zhou.

734
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,270
Talk to you later.

735
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,370
I'll get back to you later.

736
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,710
I'm meeting with the lead actors
this afternoon.

737
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,540
Come with me.

738
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:39,750
You need to learn how

739
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,710
to connect with them

740
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,790
and make them trust you.

741
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:43,830
That way,

742
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,370
it'll be easier to direct them on set.

743
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:46,430
And you.

744
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,060
You don't have to come.

745
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,620
Go buy some skincare products for me.

746
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,750
The air in Beijing is too dry.

747
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,640
Ms. Chao, don't I need
to meet the actors too?

748
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:55,620
No.

749
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,660
They are all big stars.

750
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,980
It's not good if we all go there.

751
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,710
I'll send you

752
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,230
a list of products I need later.

753
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,660
Get reimbursed from the crew later.
Thank you.

754
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,310
Ms. Chao.

755
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,660
Hey. No.

756
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,430
She's treating you like an assistant.

757
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,500
Just go along with it.

758
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:16,180
It's good enough
that we have a crew now.

759

How did you get all this stuff?

762
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:29,830
You know what?

763
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:31,310
I've never heard of some brands here.

764
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,790
I've been to so many malls in Beijing

765
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,710
but I didn't find them.

766
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,950
Tell me what you need,

767
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,870
I'll get it for you.

768
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,540
It's not for me.

769
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,180
It's for our executive producer.

770
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,830
Executive producer? Why are you
running errands for her?

771
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,910
I just want to make her happy

772
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:48,180
so that she will go easy on Zhou Shui.

773
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,430
How much are these?
I'll transfer it to you.

774
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,430
No need.

775
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,060
As long as your movie goes smoothly.

776
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,500
That's too much.

777
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,950
Our press conference
will be in a few days.

778
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:58,980
You should come.

779
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,430
I can't.

780
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,390
Actually, I want to say goodbye today.

781
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,750
What do you mean?

782
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,180
I'm going abroad to study.

783
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:08,950
Studying abroad?

784
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,180
That's great.

785
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,230
Congratulations.

786
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,910
Why so sudden?

787
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,060
When did you decide?

788
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,060
The day you came

789
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,950
to cancel the ad.

790
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,870
Now, I want to be like you.

791
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,870
I want to take control of my own fate

792
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,580
instead of letting fate change me.

793
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,540
Thank you, Daji.

794
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,660
You didn't just give Shui a push,

795
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,910
you pushed me too.

796
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,350
Thank you.

797
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,790
Don't mention it.

798
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,230
Now it's your turn to push yourself.

799

Daji,

800
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,980
don't forget why you came to Beijing.

801
00:37:59,230 --> 00:37:59,910
Use this.

Read this later.

803
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,140
But I've thought everything through.

804
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,750
The media is all here.

805
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,060
Follow the plan.

806
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,710
Don't go off track. Take it.

to producer Man Jiaxin
for his appreciation.

Next, I want to thank

00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,350
the woman who's behind me.

820
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,790
That is...

Fire away. How much do you want?

I'm not here for money.

826
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,790
Has Liao Jicai spoiled you?

827
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,390
It's been four years.

828

830
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,750
That's none of my business.

831
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,980
My priority right now

832
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,660
is to give birth to this baby.

833
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:02,870
Two million. Abort this child.

834
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,310
Not enough.

It's a boy.

00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:15,830
I know

839
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,350
Mr. Liao has five daughters.

840
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,620
This would be his only son.

841
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:27,270
So, what do you really want?

842
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,140
I heard

843
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,870
NYU's MBA program is pretty good.

844
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,310
I want to finish my studies.

845
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:33,460
If you leave, don't ever come back.

846
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:34,950
Fine.

847
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,710
But you need to send me money every year

848
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,180
until this child turns eighteen.

849
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,390
Are you insane?

850
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,910
This boy won't even be born.

851
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,270
I know.

852
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,430
So this money

853
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,310
is for buying peace of mind

854
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:55,620
for you and your daughter
when it comes time to inherit.

with Ms. Chao.

00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,540
I've neglected your feelings.

882
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,390
Well. I'll tell the whole crew

883
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,760
- Zhou Shui.
- not to call you...

884
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:33,980

885
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,750
