00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,840
=Such A Good Love=

2
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,220
=Episode 2=

3
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,509
(Spring 2017, Haikou Airport)
Your flight will depart soon.

4
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,229
Passengers who haven't
boarded the plane,

5
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,139
please board the plane
at Gate B13 immediately.

6
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,779
Thank you.

7
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,530
(I thought our love)

8
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,300
(would end together with the laptop.)

9
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,300
(I never expected)

10
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,770
(the laptop, which I had abandoned,)

11
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,770
(was picked up by someone else.)

12
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,349
(The hard disc within it,
which contained all of our memories,)

13
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,740
(was disassembled)

14
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,700
(and put in a new PC.)

15
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,740
(After many twists and turns,)

16
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,260
(it was purchased by an e-sports hotel.)

17
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,229
(Winter 2023, Beijing)
(In the last few days of 2023,)

18
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,680
(Winter 2023, Beijing)
(it was opened by a post-2000s couple.)

19
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,330
Hello.

20
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,490
Come inside.

21
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,180
Why are you standing there? Come inside.

22
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,579
I want to ask

23
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,050
if we should introduce ourselves first.

24
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,420
Is this your first time?

25
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,579
Indeed.

26
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,700
Sorry about this.

27
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,859
How old are you?

28
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,140
I was born in 2002.

29
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,020
What a brat.

30
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,330
How old are you, then?

31
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,579
I was born in 2000.

32
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,650
You're just two years older than me.

33
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,579
Enough. Cut it short.

34
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,860
Let's begin.

35
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,330
So, you want to cut to the chase, huh?

36
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,109
I don't know what you like.

37
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,139
I brought

38
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,109
my favorite one

39
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,259
here.

40
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,300
I don't know if you'll like it or not.

41
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,260
Here. I've already sanitized it.

42
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,109
You don't need to be this formal.

43
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,579
We're just playing video games.

44
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,280
It's fine as long as
you bring me to victory.

45
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,829
Don't worry.

46
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,859
You won't lose as long as

47
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,459
I'm in the room with you.

48
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,580
Let's give it a try, then.

49
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,930
I should still introduce myself.

50
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,419
Suit yourself.

51
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,739
My name is Su Zihao.

52
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,460
I'm from Chongqing.

53
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,129
I'm a senior at Capital University
of Science and Technology,

54
00:03:57,129 --> 00:03:58,540
majoring in Information Engineering.

55
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,810
What about you?

56
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,229
It's not important.

57
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,069
Of course it's important.

58
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,610
- If not, I don't know how to address you.
- Just call me Miss.

59
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,610
Miss,

60
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,509
why do you want to play video games
with someone at this late hour?

61
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,490
Are you upset?

62
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,250
Are you playing or not?

63
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,780
I am.

64
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,949
Don't worry.

65
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,180
I can win even with my eyes closed.

66
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,860
What's going on?

67
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,010
I think your PC hung.

68
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,610
Wait.

69
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,980
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

70
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,459
The computers in old internet cafes
are all refurbished machines.

71
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,019
Many of their hard discs were recycled.

72
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,139
This is too dated.

73
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,659
Such shady merchants should go bankrupt.

74
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,869
(Local C)

75
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,339
The system drive is full.

76
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,459
Look. All of these are hidden files.

77
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,610
What videos are those?

78
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,980
I don't know.

79
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,250
Do you want to take a look?

80
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,300
Let's take a look.

81
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,610
Okay.

82
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,010
It was filmed in 2007.
That's super dated.

83
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,180
I suppose that's a madam from the 80's.

84
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,869
What are you filming?

85
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,010
You.

86
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,069
Why are you filming me?

87
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,300
You look like a character from a movie.

88
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,899
Is this a documentary?

89
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,370
It's like an early version of vlog.

90
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,540
Are you sick in the head?
You're still filming me at this moment?

91
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,000
This is precisely when I should film you.
It looks a movie.

92
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,549
My goodness. They're kind of crazy.

93
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,509
Woman! I won't hold it against you!

94
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,779
Pin Zhou Shui down!

95
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,370
What are they doing?

96
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,740
Daji,

97
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,050
where do you want to go
after graduating?

98
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,370
Beijing!

99
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,540
I'm going to Beijing!

100
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,549
Really?

101
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,189
Do you

102
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,219
want to watch the rest?

103
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,019
I'm heading to Beijing!

104
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,100
Sure.

105
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,250
Okay.

106
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,930
I want to ask you this.

107
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,900
If we're destined to break up
after we arrive in Beijing,

108
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,610
if our relationship
was never destined to be fruitful,

109
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,810
was everything we did

110
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,980
still worth it?

111
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,459
I was just joking with you.

112
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,189
You fell for it, huh?

113
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,690
I'm pretty good at acting, right?

114
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,220
That was a joke.

115
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,180
See you in Beijing.

116
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,450
I'll wait for you. Goodbye.

117
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,899
Dear passengers, we've arrived
at Beijing Capital International Airport.

118
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,069
Thank you for choosing us.

119
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,780
Welcome to Beijing.

120
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:45,749
(Summer 2007, Beijing)

121
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,900
This is Beijing!

122
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,130
Beauty, get in.

123
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,540
Buddy, who are you?

124
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,540
This is a cab.

125
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,900
Really?

126
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,180
Wait.

127
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,610
I don't think you're an official cab.

128
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,290
(Free)

129
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,420
You see, that's more like it.

130
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,339
You're quite particular, huh?

131
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,699
Of course. Open the trunk.

132
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,490
Okay.

133
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,309
Beijing!

134
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,570
Welcome to Beijing!

135
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,860
What was that?

136
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,899
That's the Beijing experience.

137
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,690
Beauty, where are you heading?

138
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,010
Tiananmen Square.

139
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,370
Alright. That'll be 500 yuan.

140
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,459
Is this an extortion?

141
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,189
It costs less than 500 yuan
to tour my entire hometown, you know?

142
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,509
Do you know how huge Beijing is?

143
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,389
How huge is it?

144
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,579
Beijing has five ring roads,
just like the Olympics.

145
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,720
One ring road is 200 km long.

146
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,680
A ring road can end up causing
a long-distance relationship.

147
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,779
I'm charging you 100 yuan per ring road.
It only costs 50 cents per km.

148
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,989
Calculate it yourself.
How am I extorting you?

149
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,899
Are you sick in the head?
Who told you to cross all five ring roads?

150
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,139
Can't you take a straight path?

151
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,509
You liar.

152
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,989
You're beautiful and intelligent.

153
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,479
How can I bear to deceive you?

154
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:03,629
All right. 300 yuan.
Take it as a gift from a new friend.

155
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:04,860
No thanks. 200 yuan.

156
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,540
Do you have a boyfriend? 280 yuan.

157
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,160
That's none of your business. 220 yuan.

158
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,099
220 yuan if you don't have a boyfriend.
If you have one, then 270 yuan.

159
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,250
250 yuan.

160
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,860
Fine. 250 yuan it is, then.

161
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,370
Beauty, let me ask you something.

162
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,139
Why are you heading to Tiananmen Square?

163
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,860
I'm going to live there.

164
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,610
You want to live in Tiananmen Square?

165
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,749
Are you dumb?

166
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,139
Can people even reside there?

167
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:26,659
I plan

168
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,989
to rent a unit near Tiananmen Square.

169
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,219
It's the center of Beijing.

170
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,949
If I live there,

171
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,429
I'll be surrounded by

172
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,789
the five ring roads.

173
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,730
This way, it's convenient
no matter where I go.

174
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:43,979
Beauty. Tiananmen Square
is the center of Beijing, not you.

175
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,069
Do you know what's beside it?

176
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,000
It's the Forbidden City,
the Great Hall of the People, and Zhongnanhai.

177
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,739
Think about it.

178
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,300
Where can you reside?

179
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,970
So, I can't live there, huh?

180
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,900
What should I do, then?

181
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,859
You're lucky to encounter me.

182
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,829
You see,

183
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,459
I'm actually a property agent myself.

184
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,909
If you want to rent a unit,

185
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,260
I know a good place for you.

186
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,930
(Chunzhili)

187
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:13,330
(Chunzhili, No. 4 Courtyard)

188
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,739
Is this your so-called strategic

189
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,379
invincible luxury noble single room?

190
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,069
That's right.

191
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,970
Just look at it.

192
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,279
Is there any issue with it?

193
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,979
It's obvious that someone is living here.
Is this a single room?

194
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,819
As for her, I can tell her to leave
at any time if you want a single room.

195
00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:39,030
- How is this room related to the term "noble?"
- That'll depend on your elegance.

196
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,500
Is this 110? I need to make a report.
This is Chunzhili...

197
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,379
Heroine, don't be impulsive.

198
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,309
Return my money to me.
I'm not renting here.

199
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,619
I'll find a new place myself.

200
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,520
(22 hours ago)
A high-end apartment with an elevator,

201
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,224
a view, and located by the Third Ring Road,
costing 600 yuan per month.

202
00:09:55,224 --> 00:09:57,090
Take a look at your new home.

203
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,900
I forgot to bring the keys.

204
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,149
How could you...

205
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,749
- Let me grab the keys. Wait for me.
- Okay. I'll wait for you. Hurry.

206
00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:06,820
- It's fine. Just wait for me.
- I'll wait for you.

207
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,900
Come here.

208
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:14,499
What's wrong?

209
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,500
Come here.

210
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,300
You see,

211
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,450
shouldn't we sign the contract first?

212
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,140
This is the last available unit.

213
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,829
What if my colleagues found a new tenant

214
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,730
while I was away?

215
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,930
Do you want that to happen?

216
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,210
Do you think I'm dumb?

217
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,309
How can we allow other people
to rent this place?

218
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,379
That's right. How could we?

219
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,619
We mustn't let this happen.

220
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,029
Yeah. This is a huge bargain.

221
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,330
Yeah.

222
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,339
Sign the contract first.
Pay me the deposit as well.

223
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,300
I'll charge you 2,400 yuan
for the rent and deposit.

224
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,979
Wait. Something's off.

225
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,549
What's wrong?

226
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,459
This is wrong. I've come to my senses.

227
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,429
If I pay you right now,

228
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,309
and you run away with it,

229
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,970
what should I do, then?

230
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:01,979
You're stringent.

231
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,339
We have to be as stringent as you.

232
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,780
Of course.

233
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,219
- Your ID card, huh?
- If so, I guess it's fine.

234
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,189
Are you relieved now?

235
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,269
- Of course.
- Yeah.

236
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,069
You already showed me your ID card.

237
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,450
Alright. Go now.

238
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,260
Do you think you can rent a unit
near Third Ring Road with just 600 yuan?

239
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,829
Are you dumb?

240
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,909
How much does a unit cost
near Three Ring Road, then?

241
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,450
At least 5,000 yuan.

242
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,459
Listen. You were deceived.

243
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,930
Look at this ID card.

244
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,549
Chi Yiqian, Male.

245
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,620
Wait.

246
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,420
Sadder,

247
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,850
but wiser?

248
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,210
You!

249
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,330
Darned scum!

250
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,730
Beauty! Calm down!

251
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,189
Calm down!

252
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,099
Don't be impulsive!

253
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,429
You mustn't do this!

254
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,499
You have to calm down!

255
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
Listen. I'm very calm right now.

256
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,909
Don't!

257
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,570
I'm still injured! Look!

258
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,180
Run...

259
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,810
You're running away, huh?

260
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,660
What are you doing?

261
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,780
You're running away, huh?

262
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,500
What are you doing?

263
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,570
I know my fault now.

264
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,789
I'll count to three.

265
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,619
I know my fault now!
Miss, I'm serious.

266
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,540
Three!

267
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,789
I know my fault now!

268
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,549
You wanted to rent a unit, right?

269
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,549
I'll find you one

270
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,979
a strategic single room fit for a noble!

271
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,810
I'll be honest with you.

272
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,309
This place costs 800 yuan per month.

273
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,789
It's already the cheapest place

274
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,020
you can rent in Beijing.

275
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,420
Are there any cheaper ones available?

276
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,580
Turn it into a double room,
and your rent will be reduced by half.

277
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,149
Hello?

278
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,970
Hello?

279
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,979
Hello? Zhou Shui. Can you hear me?

280
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,930
- Hello?
- Hello, Daji?

281
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,459
What's going on over there?

282
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,180
What's with the weak signal?

283
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,219
I'm living in

284
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,099
a five-star luxury condo.

285
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,189
The wall is too thick.

286
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,260
That's why the signal is weak.

287
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,780
Daji,

288
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,699
are you used to life in Beijing, then?

289
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,900
I...

290
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,140
Yeah.

291
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,069
Listen.

292
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,429
My property agent

293
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,050
was so passionate.

294
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,850
Oh yeah, Dai Daji.
You're a future resident of Beijing.

295
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,269
Beijing welcomes you!

296
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,330
You can do it!

297
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,339
Thanks.

298
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,180
You can do it!

299
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,140
Are you here?

300
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,330
My roommate?

301
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:27,970
Goodbye.

302
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,029
The person living right next to me
is the manager of a shopping mall.

303
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,810
Shen Jingshu?

304
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,020
So, your name is Shen Jingshu.

305
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,380
That's a great name.

306
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,739
They sell top-tier

307
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,540
international luxury brands in the mall.

308
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,859
In the future,

309
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,850
the mall might become my private closet.

310
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,309
My neighbors to the left are IT experts.

311
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:55,180
They do international trading.

312
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,140
Morning, beauty.

313
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,829
What are you saying?

314
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,069
Haven't you guys asked
that scum what happened yesterday?

315
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,859
Do you think you can mess with me?

316
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,519
Of course not.

317
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,040
Why are you trying
to mess with me, then?

318
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,570
I'm not.

319
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,069
Let me introduce myself.

320
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,499
I'm Glasses.

321
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:10,949
Glasses?

322
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:11,829
Yeah.

323
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,459
I'm Vest.

324
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,450
Vest?

325
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,219
Listen closely. My name is Dai Daji.

326
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,069
I've already exchanged

327
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,979
my name card with them.

328
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,789
In the future, we might discuss
trades worth tens of millions.

329
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,450
Tens of millions?

330
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,309
The neighbor to my right

331
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,540
is a famous bodybuilder.

332
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,850
He's built like Schwarzenegger.

333
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,180
Hello.

334
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,459
My name is Liang Yalin.

335
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,189
Hello.

336
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:36,859
I'm a bodybuilder.

337
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,979
I can tell. My name is Dai Daji.
Nice to meet you.

338
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,339
Although he looks muscular,

339
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,260
he's very kind.

340
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,210
Where did you get this flatbread?

341
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,789
It was quite a coincidence.

342
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,699
Someone hung them on my door.

343
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,930
They're free.

344
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,219
- Do you want some?
- You can enjoy them yourself.

345
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,810
You don't want it, huh?
Why don't you let go of me first?

346
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,020
Sorry about that.

347
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,140
He has such a strong grip.

348
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,579
Under my unit

349
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,930
is a five-star restaurant.

350
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,189
The owner

351
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,789
is a dignified old mister.

352
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,180
He has a grandson as well.

353
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,780
He's very polite.

354
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:09,949
Who are you?

355
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,029
Sorry about that.

356
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,309
Hello. I'm Dai Daji.

357
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,189
I just moved here.

358
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,730
How should I address you?

359
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,269
You can call me Old Chives.

360
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,300
The wonton stall downstairs is mine.

361
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,620
You...

362
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:23,780
You...

363
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,859
There are chives stuck in your teeth.

364
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,309
I'm good friends

365
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,810
with the restaurant owner now.

366
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,499
I suppose I'll have lunch
there in the future.

367
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,780
It's my private kitchen now.

368
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,499
Who stole my sausages again?

369
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,789
I only took half of it.

370
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,269
You stole my socks.

371
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,789
You stole my sausages as well!

372
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,069
- Write your name on it.
- I should write my name on it?

373
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,449
If not, they'll steal it.

374
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,959
The socks are mine. And the underpants.

375
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,260
- Everything is mine!
- Stop arguing.

376
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,909
Listen. It's fine.

377
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,029
Stop it.

378
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,449
The people here
are very harmonious and well-mannered.

379
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:02,560
That sounds like an excellent place.
Which part of Beijing are you residing at?

380
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,420
My villa is right next to
the Third Ring Road.

381
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,029
The Third Ring Road never sleeps.

382
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,699
There are plenty of cars here.

383
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,829
But that's how Beijing is.

384
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,949
It's filled with cars, people,
and buildings.

385
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,570
It's filled with opportunities as well.

386
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,900
Really?

387
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,579
Why does it sound unrealistic to me?

388
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,540
That's how it's supposed to be.

389
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,140
Dreams aren't realistic
in the first place.

390
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,290
If not, why do you think people
flock to Beijing to chase their dreams?

391
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,570
You do have a point.

392
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,690
Daji.

393
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,210
Let me ask you this.

394
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,660
Go ahead.

395
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:41,300
Do you think your trip
to Beijing is worth it?

396
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,140
Beijing,

397
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,660
here I come!

398
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,380
(Since then, I started my life as
a Beijing drifter.)

399
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,490
(That day)

400
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,730
(was 380 days away from the opening
of the Beijing Olympics.)

401
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,450
(The Bird's Nest was still
under construction.)

402
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,340
(It received plenty of attention
due to its unique design.)

403
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,659
(The other landmark building)

404
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,250
(was the CCTV headquarters,
which was also under construction.)

405
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,980
(I was filled with determination.)

406
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,760
(Congratulations to Beijing)

407
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,040
(for hosting the next Olympics)
(I thought Beijing was filled with opportunities.)

408
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,200
(Winter 2007)
(I never expected)

409
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,320
(Winter 2007, Beijing)
(that not a single one of them belonged to me.)

410
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,180
Okay.

411
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,380
Old Chives.

412
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,269
Give me a set of flatbread.

413
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,099
Okay.

414
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,210
Separate it into three bags.

415
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,509
- Do you want three of them?
- No. I want one.

416
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,620
Split it into three for me.

417
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,979
(Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)

418
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,250
(Glasses, Daji)

419
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,930
Beauty, what do you want?

420
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,709
I'm checking out some foundations.

421
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,060
Which shade do you need?

422
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,970
Maybe

423
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,450
No. 2.

424
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,180
No. 2 for this customer.

425
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:13,859
Wait.

426
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,659
Don't do it first.

427
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,620
What's wrong?

428
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,210
You see,

429
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,309
I might have to try it first.

430
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,970
Alright. You can go ahead.

431
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,820
Miss.

432
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,250
Were you calling me?

433
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,930
You don't know
which shade to choose, right?

434
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:36,449
Yeah.

435
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,029
Have a seat. I'll give you some samples.

436
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,579
Don't. It's too troublesome.

437
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,100
It's fine. You have to try them
before buying them.

438
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,060
I'll let you try out No. 1 and No. 2.

439
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,210
Are you going for a job interview?

440
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,340
That's right.

441
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,620
How did you know?

442
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,770
Here you go.

443
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,970
This is No. 1.

444
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,179
May you pass your job interview.

445
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,419
- Thank you.
- Don't mention.

446
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,620
You are?

447
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,820
Shen Jingshu?

448
00:19:02,952 --> 00:19:04,610
(Intern, Shen Jingshu)

449
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,530
Are you Shen Jingshu?

450
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,659
Do you live in Chunzhili?

451
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,859
How did you know?

452
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,339
What a coincidence.

453
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,309
Yeah.

454
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,619
This must be destiny.

455
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,000
We're destined to meet.

456
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,549
- You attended university, right?
- Which university are you from?

457
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,549
It was an ordinary one.

458
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,380
I don't think you know.

459
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,229
Aren't there any dormitories
in your university?

460
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:23,749
There are.

461
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,060
But I get off work late
due to my part-time job.

462
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,140
Therefore, I rented my bed
to a postgraduate student.

463
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,599
I rent it to them
for 800 yuan per month.

464
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:31,480
I rent the room in Chunzhili
for 400 yuan per month.

465
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,420
- I earn a net profit of 400 yuan per month.
- You're amazing.

466
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,580
Let me see.

467
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,139
What happened to your hands?

468
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:38,789
I'm fine.

469
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,309
What kind of part-time jobs do you do?

470
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,340
I work at hotpot shops, cafes,

471
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,540
and many other places.
I do some freelance work as well.

472
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,450
That sounds like a lot.

473
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,250
I haven't even found a job yet.

474
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,379
You'll be fine. I'll help you put on makeup
before your job interview.

475
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,509
You'll definitely look dazzling.

476
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,240
You'll be fine.

477
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,929
But the dress code of the interview
is supposed to be formal clothing.

478
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:00,339
Do you know where I can get them
for a cheap price?

479
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,320
- I don't mind buying used items as well.
- Come. Let me take you there.

480
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,970
You don't need to buy them.
I'll show you a trick.

481
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,229
Not bad.

482
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,450
You should prepare yourself
and report for duty soon.

483
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:11,789
Alright.

484
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,419
What about me?

485
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,309
As for you,

486
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,619
wait for our notice.

487
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,099
Next.

488
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,180
If so, I...

489
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,100
Wait.

490
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:18,829
Miss,

491
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,029
can you help me take a look?

492
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,469
What exactly is wrong with my profile?

493
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,280
Am I not qualified
in terms of education level?

494
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,509
Or do I lack work experience?

495
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,900
Why do I fail all of my job interviews?

496
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,250
This coat of yours...

497
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,180
You could tell, huh? It's new.

498
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,690
Thanks for nothing.

499
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,530
Two.

500
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:52,860
Three.

501
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,229
(Chengpin.com)

502
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,860
Beauty, it's been almost an hour.

503
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,549
An hour of Internet service
costs five yuan.

504
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,640
Five yuan per hour?
You guys might as well rob me.

505
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,859
Our Internet speed is fast.
And, you're our VIP.

506
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,419
- Our PCs are great as well.
- As if.

507
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,229
I can't even send an email.

508
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,160
It took me 20 minutes.

509
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,620
(Chatting with Zhou Shui. Video Call)
Why did it take 20 minutes?

510
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,620
- That won't do.
- That won't do. 20 minutes?

511
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,659
Don't talk.

512
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,180
If not, I won't pay you guys.

513
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,820
That's serious.

514
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,930
Daji.

515
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,100
Zhou Shui.

516
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,100
Why is it so dark over there?

517
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,339
I...

518
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,989
My camera isn't working.

519
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,620
Can you see me, then?

520
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,970
Yeah.

521
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,100
Alright, then.

522
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:33,379
So,

523
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,620
why didn't you answer my calls
for the past few days?

524
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,899
Don't call me for fun when you're free.

525
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,420
- It's quite expensive.
- It's fine. I just want to ask you

526
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,600
how you intend to celebrate
the New Year.

527
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,640
We're going to set off fireworks in Haikou.
Do you guys have that in Beijing?

528
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,099
No.

529
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,490
Fireworks and firecrackers
are forbidden in Beijing.

530
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,690
That's fine.

531
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,989
I think you can see them
as long as you want to.

532
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,619
We can't set them off in Beijing.

533
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,420
How can I see them?

534
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:01,899
For example,

535
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,450
I can set them off in Beijing for you.

536
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,140
Thanks.

537
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,820
But I might not be here
by the time you're here.

538
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,340
What do you mean? You might not be there?

539
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,060
You see,

540
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,690
Beijing is different
from what you imagined.

541
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,620
I don't think I can
stay here any longer.

542
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,860
Daji, what do you mean by that?

543
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,040
Didn't you get yourself a job?

544
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,829
You said you were living in a nice condo.
And, we made a promise, right?

545
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,240
We're supposed to meet in Beijing

546
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,539
and become the best "adulterous couple" in
the film industry. Aren't you wait for me?

547
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:37,100
Since when did I say I want to
be an "adulterous couple" with you?

548
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,820
That's not the kind
of relationship we have.

549
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,380
What kind of relationship
do we have, then?

550
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,730
Daji?

551
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,170
(Chatting with Zhou Shui. Video Call)

552
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,309
Daji, you...

553
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,100
It's a hunk.

554
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,029
Hello, hunk.

555
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:00,989
Hello.

556
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,029
Who are you guys?

557
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,989
Why are you guys living in Daji's house?

558
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,069
Daji?

559
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,419
Daji's house?

560
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,029
We're sharing a unit.

561
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,620
Buddy, this is a shared unit.

562
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,469
Wait. She told me that
she was living in a huge unit.

563
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,579
I'm afraid you don't know

564
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,709
the kind of life
she's leading in Beijing.

565
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:18,939
I'll tell you this. She split a flatbread
into three for her three meals, you know?

566
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,419
She didn't get a job as well.

567
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,469
Are you her boyfriend?

568
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,580
Are you heartless?

569
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,770
He hung up.

570
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,419
Why didn't he ask us
where she was living?

571
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,580
Yeah.

572
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,580
Hunk, get in.

573
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,490
Buddy, who are you?

574
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,930
I'm a cab driver.

575
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,420
Really?

576
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,250
I don't think this is an official cab.

577
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,290
(Free)

578
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,140
It's much better now.

579
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,139
Open the trunk. Thanks.

580
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,140
Hunk, you're pretty stringent as well.

581
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,450
As well?

582
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,309
Beijing!

583
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,859
Hunk, where are you heading?

584
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,250
Tiananmen Square.

585
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,549
Tiananmen Square again?

586
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,789
Are you going to live there?

587
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,829
Are you dumb? Can I even reside there?

588
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,380
I'm going to rent a unit near that area.

589
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,789
It's the center of Beijing.

590
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,029
If I live there...

591
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:48,989
You'll be surrounded by

592
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,859
the five ring roads.

593
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,100
This way, it's convenient
no matter where you go.

594
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,770
Buddy, how did you know
what I was going to say?

595
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,339
Buddy,

596
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,900
you resemble someone I know.

597
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,250
Takeshi Kaneshiro, right?

598
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,180
Many people say that.

599
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:09,450
You're pretty confident in yourself.
I'm Takeshi Kaneshiro.

600
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,419
Actually, I'm a part-time
property agent as well.

601
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,709
If you want to rent a place,
I have a good place for you.

602
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,469
You're a part-time
property agent as well?

603
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,549
Great.

604
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,579
Do you have a luxury condo

605
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,029
beside the Third Ring Road

606
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,760
with an elevator and a great view
that only costs 600 yuan per month?

607
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,379
Have I entered the Otherworld?

608
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,060
Is this an endless loop?

609
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,290
Buddy, what does that mean?

610
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,290
No.

611
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,859
I must break the cycle!

612
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,859
I have to!

613
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,180
You like movies, huh?

614
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,029
Sci-fi movies, right?
I'll recommend some...

615
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,379
You want to rent a unit, right?

616
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,619
I'll show you a great place.

617
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,659
Let's go.

618
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,380
Let's go!

619
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,100
Beijing!

620
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,520
Here's your invincible
luxury noble single room.

621
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,469
It's pretty good, right?

622
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,469
It's entirely different
from what you had described.

623
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,770
How is this a single room?

624
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,179
You're penniless. To you,
this is a single room.

625
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,210
Come on.

626
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,619
Let's go inside.

627
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,659
Come.

628
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,989
Take a look.

629
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,450
Isn't this great?

630
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,379
Jingshu, I'll be fine
with the job interview, right?

631
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,469
Definitely. I've already helped you
to put on makeup.

632
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,549
Don't you think my lipstick is too much?

633
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,139
Not at all.
This isn't even thick makeup.

634
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:26,509
Really?

635
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,709
You can definitely take the position

636
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,939
and radiate your brilliance.

637
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,749
I'll succeed.

638
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,829
- You will.
- I'll succeed.

639
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,419
- You will.
- I will!

640
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,530
You'll definitely succeed.

641
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,469
Let me introduce him.

642
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,709
This is your new roommate.

643
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,509
You two can mingle with each other.

644
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,309
Alright. Got it.

645
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,420
I'll make a move first.

646
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,709
This room is pretty good, right?

647
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,060
Even I want to live here.

648
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,229
Wait, you...

649
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,140
I'll make a move first.

650
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,060
Just ignore him.

651
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,240
Here, buddy.

652
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,859
Nice to meet you. My name is Liang Yalin.
You can call me Dumbbell.

653
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,749
I'm Zhou Shui.

654
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,789
Hello, Mr. Muscle.

655
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,380
You have a strong grip.

656
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,820
Why did you come to Beijing?

657
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,010
I came here to look for someone.

658
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,450
She's very important to me.

659
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,380
Is she your girlfriend?

660
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,939
Not yet.

661
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,140
But I like her a lot.

662
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,549
Shouldn't you go and find her, then?
What are you doing here?

663
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:22,029
I can't afford to let her know
that I've come to Beijing.

664
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,060
Why?

665
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,860
Because I'm penniless.

666
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,660
I can't help her out either.

667
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,339
I was thinking
that I should make some money

668
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,629
and become a director first.

669
00:27:29,629 --> 00:27:32,970
After that, I'll appear in front of her
like a hero and rescue the damsel in distress.

670
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,579
Guys like you who devote everything
to love are very impressive.

671
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,229
You can do it! Burn with determination!

672
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,659
Stay determined! You can do this!

673
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,060
- You can do this!
- Thank you.

674
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,629
Don't you think they're crazy?

675
00:27:45,629 --> 00:27:48,520
They only met each other a few times,
but they came to Beijing with reckless abandon.

676
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,120
Both of them are totally love-struck.

677
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,339
Don't they know
that love is the death of everything?

678
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,490
Don't tell me you fell out of love?

679
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,060
Tell me about it.

680
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,380
There's a girl.

681
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,860
I fancied her throughout
the three years of high school

682
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,450
and four years of university.

683
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,820
But one day,
when I woke up in the morning,

684
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,690
she was lying on my roommate's bed.

685
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,530
Isn't that normal?

686
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,619
Don't you have

687
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,730
any shred of sympathy?

688
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,619
Don't you guys assess
one's character and worldview

689
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,309
before falling in love with them?

690
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,490
Won't you guys do a MBTI test
to see if you're compatible?

691
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,820
This is called physical attraction.

692
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:33,010
She's charming, isn't she?

693
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,100
Aren't I charming?

694
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,290
You?

695
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,340
You just put in too much effort.

696
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:46,140
What about you?
Do you have someone you fancy?

697
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,340
I don't date.

698
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,269
There's nothing that you must
do through a romantic relationship.

699
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,320
Moreover, there are plenty
of things you cannot do

700
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,989
due to a romantic relationship.

701
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,140
The wise don't fall in love.

702
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:00,530
You're sticking
to what you know best, huh?

703
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,890
(Best Youth Producer)

704
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,770
You're Zhou Shui, right?

705
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,309
Hello.

706
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,139
I'm Derrick.

707
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,069
Derrick.

708
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,789
You're the golden producer
of Chinese films.

709
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,530
I've watched all of your movies.

710
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,010
Which one?

711
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,469
Every one.

712
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,549
Every one?

713
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,709
If so, you're the second person

714
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,139
in the world who has watched
all of my films.

715
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:22,549
Thank you.

716
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,509
It's my pleasure.

717
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,269
My pleasure.

718
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,420
Have a seat.

719
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,229
I called you before this.

720
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,099
I'm here to apply for
the director position.

721
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,530
This is the latest script I've written.

722
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,989
It's called "Harmony."

723
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,680
- You can take a look.
- No need for that.

724
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,549
I don't look at past works.

725
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,970
I only look at the future.

726
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,789
I just spoke with Mr. Peter

727
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,029
from Warner.

728
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,899
He said

729
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,989
he lacked a director for a film.

730
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,619
It's produced by Ang Lee.

731
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,339
The main lead is Tony Leung.

732
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,530
Are you interested?

733
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,490
No.

734
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,340
I want to make my own movie.

735
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:03,690
You're young, vigorous,
and you have quite the attitude.

736
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,970
I like you.

737
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,899
What about this?
Let's not waste any time here.

738
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,530
We should sign the contract.

739
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,029
Already?

740
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,309
I've already had the contract

741
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,619
reviewed by Hollywood's legal team.

742
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,490
You can even use it in the U.S.

743
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,380
The director's pay...

744
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,469
It's in the millions?

745
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,900
That's right.

746
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,660
Alright!

747
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,060
Most importantly,

748
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,730
you told me this during our call.

749
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,859
If I sign a contract with you,

750
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,859
we can

751
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,749
hold a press conference
for Beijing to see.

752
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,789
Does that still count?

753
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:39,690
Have I

754
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,180
said that before?

755
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,099
You have to do it.

756
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,619
I'm looking for someone in Beijing.

757
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,180
I need her to know
that I'm coming to her rescue.

758
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,099
Lift up your bangs.

759
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,250
Let me take a look.

760
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,420
Alright. Do a spin.

761
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,379
Okay.

762
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,469
Introduce yourselves.

763
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,660
Tell us if you have a boyfriend.

764
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,420
Tell us your height, weight,
and measurements.

765
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,709
Don't worry. You'll definitely
be able to rescue her.

766
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,210
Do it immediately.

767
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,660
Alright. I'll sign the contract, then.

768
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,580
Go ahead.

769
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,179
Okay. Thank you, Derrick.

770
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,180
So...

771
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:31,709
Here.

772
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:32,660
Wait.

773
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:36,419
You have to dress yourself formally
for the press conference.

774
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,709
Do you have an evening suit

775
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,770
or

776
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,930
a well-tailored suit?

777
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,140
No.

778
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,770
This is quite troublesome.

779
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,789
But we can contact Tom

780
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,269
and make a custom one for him.

781
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,290
However, for the fees,

782
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,860
you have to pay us first.

783
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,060
Okay.

784
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,530
How much?

785
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,139
Mr. Interviewer,

786
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,100
I haven't introduced myself yet.

787
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,140
Speak.

788
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:07,490
What's the relationship
between my availability and my job?

789
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,619
And, what do our height, weight,
and measurements

790
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,900
have to do with this job?

791
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,099
Understood. Thanks for coming.

792
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,179
Dai Daji, you may leave first.

793
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,069
We'll contact you
if there are any updates.

794
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:23,420
Remember to contact me. Thank you.

795
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:34,250
Hello. The number
you have dialed does not exist.

796
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,309
Can you help me find Derrick

797
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,069
from Room 1131?

798
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,930
Okay.

799
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,939
Our guest in Room 1131

800
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,580
has already checked out this afternoon.

801
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,970
He checked out?

802
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,339
Isn't it a company?

803
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,379
How could he check out?

804
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,789
He just took all of my money.

805
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,580
All of my money, you know?

806
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,659
Mister,

807
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,010
our guest has already checked out.

808
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,339
In the future, we must buy
a bigger dressing table.

809
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,340
It'll surely be expensive.

810
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:09,579
The large ones in the returns and
exchange section seem to cost over 300 yuan.

811
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,290
Why didn't you buy it, then?

812
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,900
Once we're rich,

813
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,380
we'll buy a 3,000 yuan dressing table.

814
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,549
I haven't even gotten a job yet.

815
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,250
How can I be rich?

816
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,900
I can't even afford to have dinner now.

817
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,420
I have to have this as supper.

818
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,620
Who's there?

819
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,099
Free flatbread?

820
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,250
Dumbbell?

821
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,290
So, it's you.

822
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,339
You were the one who hung
flatbread on my door, huh?

823
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,069
Yeah.

824
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:44,229
Why did you deliver breakfast
to me every day?

825
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:47,659
That's not it. I went for a jog.
I bought it because I was passing by.

826
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,709
You were passing by, huh?

827
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,469
Who's that?

828
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,619
Jingshu.

829
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,660
This is Dumbbell.

830
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,789
He's pretty weird.

831
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,829
He hangs flatbread on my door every day.

832
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:58,580
He delivers breakfast to me.
Dumbbell, what do you mean by this?

833
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,379
- Don't tell me you like me?
- That's not it!

834
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,120
Jingshu, don't listen to her.
That's not true.

835
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,419
- Don't misunderstand me. That's not true.
- Why would you fall for me? Listen.

836
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,829
You better don't fantasize about me.

837
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:13,789
I didn't.

838
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:14,499
I'm serious.

839
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,210
I don't like muscular men like you.
I have a boyfriend.

840
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,500
You're bothering me.

841
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,939
Daji, Dumbbell is just kind.

842
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,939
Since he already bought it,
you should have it.

843
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,589
I'll accept it this time.

844
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,939
Don't buy them for me again.

845
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,290
I have a boyfriend.

846
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,660
And, he's super handsome.

847
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,890
Goodbye.

848
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:48,890
Jingshu.

849
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,890
I'm thinking about something.

850
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:54,210
Say, could it be
that Dumbbell wasn't buying

851
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,810
these flatbread for me?

852
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,460
Could they be for you?

853
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,109
They're for you, huh?

854
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,829
My goodness.
I've taken such a huge bite.

855
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:04,709
I'll return it to you.

856
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,269
It's fine. You can go ahead.

857
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,019
I'm so sorry.

858
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,210
It's fine.

859
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,589
So, are you two a couple?

860
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,379
No.

861
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,109
No?

862
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,340
- We...
- He has a crush on you.

863
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,739
- I don't know. You see...
- There's something between you two.

864
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,250
- That's not true.
- Do you like him, then?

865
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,060
Daji,

866
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,850
you said your boyfriend
was super handsome.

867
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,669
How handsome is he?

868
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,060
How handsome is he?

869
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,410
I think

870
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,500
he resembles Takeshi Kaneshiro.

871
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,229
How was your day?

872
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,690
Did you become a hero?

873
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,850
Not only did I not find her,
but I was also scammed.

874
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,660
I realize that it's hard to be a hero

875
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,500
in Beijing.

876
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,709
But we aren't an official couple.

877
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,250
You guys aren't a couple either?

878
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,880
What kind of relationship
do you two have, then?

879
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:59,020
I think it might not work out for us.

880
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,330
But why?

881
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,339
We agreed to meet in Beijing

882
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,410
during the New Year.

883
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,709
But I'm not doing well now.

884
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,290
I'm almost at my wit's end.

885
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,060
I might not be able to persevere
until the New Year.

886
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:17,370
Anyway, that's the gist of it.

887
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:22,560
Initially, I promised her that I would come
to Beijing and set off fireworks for her

888
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,810
during the New Year.

889
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,890
Now, I think I might have
to go back on my promise.

890
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,410
You can do this.

891
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,620
Strive harder tomorrow.

892
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,460
I think you should hang in there
for a little longer.

893
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,620
What if he does come here
after the New Year?

894
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,210
Say, even if I do find her,
what's the point?

895
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,669
I can't do anything to help her out.

896
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,669
I have no reason to persuade her
to stay in Beijing.

897
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,940
So what if he's here?

898
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,690
I'll leave after the New Year.

899
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,060
And, I don't want him to know

900
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,500
that I'm doing poorly.

901
00:37:06,232 --> 00:37:08,770
(Daji)

902
00:37:15,592 --> 00:37:18,890
(Zhou Shui)

903
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,850
Hold it properly.

904
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,180
This is Derrick speaking.

905
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,250
I'm currently busy.

906
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,660
This is Derrick speaking.

907
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,410
I'm currently busy.

908
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:09,330
(Give a reply tomorrow)

909
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,229
Next station is Shichahai Station.

910
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,370
Please be ready.

911
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,379
Head to the entrance.
Walk toward the entrance.

912
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,020
- Stop squeezing.
- Yeah.

913
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,109
Excuse me.

914
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,620
Let's swap our positions.

915
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,690
Madams, let's go.

916
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,660
Beijing has its own sea too.

917
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,020
It's called Shichahai.

918
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,200
You can head there
if you don't believe me.

919
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,410
See you in Beijing.

920
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,330
See you in Beijing.

921
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,709
Daji.

922
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,660
Zhou Shui, you liar!

923
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,410
Shichahai isn't a sea.

924
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:32,419
Shichahai is
a terrible excuse for a sea.

925
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,500
It's not a sea at all!

926
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,980
Zhou Shui, you liar!

927
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,660
In Beijing, it's considered a sea.

928
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,770
If so, when will
tiny river shrimps like us

929
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,660
be able to swim into the sea?

930
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:56,749
Aren't we

931
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,890
already by the sea?

932
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,500
It's almost the New Year.

933
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:16,500
Yeah. Happy the New Year.

934
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,250
Say,

935
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,140
can I still enjoy fireworks in Beijing?

936
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,770
(An omniscient perspective
doesn't exist in life.)

937
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:11,899
(We have no way to choose
all of the correct answers)

938
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,060
(when we have to make decisions.)

939
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,850
(Just like the current us.)

940
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,370
(Although we're within arm's reach,)

941
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,580
