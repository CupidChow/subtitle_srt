00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,440
(Lunar January 2012, Beijing)

00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,240
(In the 62nd)

5
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,780

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,150

00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,570
won with "Caesar Must Die".

8
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,730
It took home
the Golden Bear for Best Film.

9
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,980
Can you come home early today?

10
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,650
I can't be sure yet.

11
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,190
I don't know if I have to work late.

12
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,110
I'll wash the dishes.

13
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,030
Tonight...

14
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,900
Tonight is...

15
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,730
What is it?

16
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,280
Just say it.

17
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,030
Daji is finally coming back.

18
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,320
She'll be in Beijing tonight.

19
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,480
She's finally coming back.

20
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,400
Daji...

21
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,780
This is awesome.

22
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,760
You two can have
Valentine's Day all to yourselves.

23
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,570
Dumbbell, I won't bug you anymore.

24
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,650
I can finally give this gift tonight.

25
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,900
It's Valentine's Day.

26
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,820
Sorry, I totally forgot.

27
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,610
I promise to come home early, okay?

28
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,320
Bye, I'm off to work.

29
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,240
I'll walk you out.

30
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,150
Almost there. Hang tight.

31
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,320
Go faster.

32
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,820
Are you a grandma or what?

33
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,860
You're terrible.

34
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,690
Here we are. This is it.

35
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,360
Right here.

36
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,320
I'm heading in.

37
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,030
Wait a second.

38
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,780
I'll pick you up after work.

39
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:01,680
That's okay.

40
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,230
- What do you mean okay?
- It's too far.

41
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,440
You still have class, remember?

42
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,230
It's fine.

43
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,760
I get off early this afternoon.

44
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,530
I won't ride in anyone else's car again.

45
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,570
Don't worry.

46
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,610
Okay.

47
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,860
Knock it off. People will see us.

48
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,730
So what?

49
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,940
A boyfriend kissing you
is totally normal.

50
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,070
Dummy. Bye.

51
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,280
Stay safe.

52
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:30,820
Bye.

53
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,650
Everyone, listen up.

54
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,820
According to headquarters,

55
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,730
lately,

56
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,860
a mysterious big client

57
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,690
will be visiting our store.

58
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,480
So, I want you to go above and beyond.

59
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,280
- What big client?
- Give them a warm welcome.

60
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,720
Understood?

61
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,530
Word is, he is a super VIP.

62
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,530
At other stores,
he spend over ten million at a time.

63
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:48,820
Ten million!

64
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,940
Whether or not you get
your year-end bonus

65
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,360
all depends on him.

66
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,400
Got it?

67
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,480
Got it!

68
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,230
Manager,

69
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,690
what does that client look like?

70
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,190
What does a rich person look like?

71
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,530
That's exactly how he looks.

72
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,360
So,

73
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,690
keep your eyes wide open.

74
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,570
Is that clear?

75
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:05,780
Yes!

76
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,360
Good. Get back to work.

77
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,530
What do the rich look like?

78
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,110
All the best!

79
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,900
Smile! Everyone, big smile!

80
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,780
He really looks loaded.

81
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,730
Back to your stations!

82
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,150
Welcome, sir!

83
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,110
Sorry.

84
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,980
I'm Mr. Zhang's driver.

85
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,860
I'm just here

86
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,530
to pick up his serviced car.

87
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,570
This way, please.

88
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,530
Alright, thanks.

89
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,730
Is that client coming or not?

90
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,530
I've been starving all day
waiting for him.

91
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,820
Forget it. Let's just call it a day.

92
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:56,940
Miss,

93
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,070
I'm heading out first.

94
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,530
I need to catch the subway.
I can't get home too late.

95
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,530
- Bye.
- Bye.

96
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,360
See you tomorrow.

97
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,320
Bye.

98
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,650
Welcome.

99
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,940
First time visiting our store?

100
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,280
What are you looking for today?

101
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,320
Just browsing.

102
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,320
Looking at cars, great.

103
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,690
I'll get a sales rep for you.

104
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,690
Miss.

105
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,320
Can you take this one?

106
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,440
Are you buying a car?

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,070
What else would I be doing?

108
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,520
Which model are you thinking?

109
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,400
I won't know

110
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,780
until you recommend them to me.

111
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,030
We've got way too many models in stock.

112
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,190
It's almost closing time.

113
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,360
No way I can go over them all.

114
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,360
Sir, this model

115
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,610
is a 2012 model,

116
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,400
newly launched for the Chinese market.

117
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,570
And this is launching

118
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,190
at the Guangzhou Auto Show this summer.

119
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,110
How about

120
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,730
I carry it for you?

121
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:52,820
Sure.

122
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,400
What about this one?

123
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,280
This one here?

124
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,030
Sir,

125
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,570
to be honest,
I'm not a professional sales rep.

126
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,360
How about you relax
in the lounge for a bit?

127
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,320
I'll get you some tea.

128
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,650
Then, I'll have someone take over.

129
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,940
Alright, no rush.

130
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:15,940
What car is this?

131
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,610
This one starts at 1.8 million yuan.

132
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,030
1.8 million yuan?
Is it gold-plated or something?

133
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,360
If you can't afford it,
you can finance it.

134
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,030
Who'd finance it?

135
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,190
You still have to pay interest.
I'm paying in full.

136
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,980
Sorry, but I need you to come with me

137
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,480
back to the office for a bit.

138
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,320
Leave the stuff here.

139
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,110
Just grab a cab and head home, alright?

140
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:52,530
Alright.

141
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,070
Hey.

142
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:53,650
Zhaoyang,

143
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,030
this bag you gave me
is way too expensive.

144
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,320
I really shouldn't accept it.

145
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,360
I already told you

146
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,280
to treat it as your travel
allowance for the trip.

147
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,230
You earned it.

148
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,110
That's too much for a travel allowance.

149
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,820
Do the math.

150
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,070
If I had to hire a translator on my own,

151
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,190
for this many days,
it would've cost tens of thousands.

152
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,400
Besides, you followed me overseas,
missed Chinese New Year,

153
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,480
and didn't get to spend

154
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,230
Valentine's with Zhou Shui.

155
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,230
Take it.

156
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,110
Thanks, boss.

157
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,280
I'm glad you like it.

158
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,820
- Valentine's Day.
- Surprise!

159
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,190
- Daji!
- Dumbbell, it's you!

160
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:30,980
You're back!

161
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,230
You sound disappointed.

162
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,190
Oh, right.

163
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,570
Where's Jingshu?

164
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,530
She's working late.

165
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,400
Working overtime, huh?

166
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,530
This is a gift for you and Jingshu.

167
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,440
You brought gifts too?

168
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:40,980
Yup!

169
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:41,940
Thank you!

170
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,070
You really didn't have to.

171
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,530
Of course I did.

172
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,570
Where's Zhou Shui?

173
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,190
Inside.

174
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:46,980
- Zhou Shui!
- Daji!

175
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,530
Zhou Shui!

176
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,570
You're finally back!

177
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,440
I missed you so much.

178
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,280
I missed you too.

179
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,480
Daji!

180
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,760
Come on, come with me.

181
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,040
- Come with me
- What's the rush?

182
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,780
Come with me.

183
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,610
Don't move.

184
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,440
Surprise!

185
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,190
I saw your old backpack

186
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,440
was getting worn out.

187
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,820
So, I got you a new one.

188
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,440
This backpack suits you way better.

189
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,820
What do you think? Nice, right?

190
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,570
Yeah.

191
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,940
I hand-picked this.

192
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:23,530
Do you like it?

193
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,980
But I gave you the money
to buy stuff for yourself.

194
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,150
You used it to get me a bag?

195
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,360
It's fine, I got one too.

196
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,440
This one's mine.

197
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,730
Now, we have matching bags!

198
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,360
That brand is expensive, right?

199
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,570
Was the money I gave you enough?

200
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,780
Of course not.

201
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,650
That bag cost almost 3,000 euros.

202
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,480
Over 20,000 yuan.

203
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,190
Exactly.

204
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,280
Where'd you get that money?
Did you sell your blood?

205
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,030
Seriously?

206
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,030
Come on, quit it.

207
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,610
It didn't cost me anything. It was free.
Chaoyang gave it to me.

208
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,530
Why would he give you a bag?

209
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,570
He said it was my travel allowance.

210
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,440
And the other one?

211
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,760
He felt bad that I didn't make it home
for Chinese New Year.

212
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,900
I guess he felt a bit guilty.
So he gave me the bag.

213
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,110
It's pretty pricey too.

214
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,320
Here, take a look.

215
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,570
You know,

216
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,230
this bag looks normal

217
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,570
given its hefty price tag.

218
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,230
Good for work, though.

219
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:17,940
Right?

220
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,440
It goes with anything, actually.

221
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,940
Oh yeah, Zhou Shui.

222
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,070
Here's the money you gave me.

223
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,650
I didn't spend a single cent.

224
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,650
Here, take it back.

225
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,690
Use it sparingly.
We'll need it for rent.

226
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,360
Daji.

227
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,530
Let me help you unpack.

228
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,030
Can you bring my suitcase in?

229
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,650
Sure.

230
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,690
Morning.

231
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,440
Morning.

232
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,720
I'll come out and help in a bit.

233
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,190
Okay.

234
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,320
Jingshu, you're here.

235
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,500
Happy Chinese New Year.
Wishing you wealth and success.

236
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,400
Mr. Liao, the Chinese New Year is already over.

237
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,520
We have a tradition back home.

238
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,240
We celebrating the Chinese New Year
thoughout the first lunar month.

239
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,530
Shouldn't you be with your family?

240
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,030
I think being with you matters more.

241
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,360
(Autumn 2024, Beijing)

242
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,880
(Autumn 2024, Beijing)
What's all this?

243
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,570
What did you buy?

244
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,690
Leyi, it's all yours.

245
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,070
Mine?

246
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:46,690
Yup.

247
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,030
I didn't buy anything, though.

248
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,230
Zhang Shiyu,
what's that supposed to mean?

249
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,280
Why'd you send the stuff to my office?

250
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,680
You wouldn't tell me where you live.

251
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,150
Where else was I supposed to send it?

252
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,940
Wait, what's going on?
Are you remodeling or something?

253
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,150
Remodel what?

254
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,440
Your dad and I filed for divorce.

255
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,650
We've divided the assets.

256
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:13,650
We even sold the house.

257
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:14,820
What do you mean?

258
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,980
Sold it? Where am I supposed to live?

259
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,900
Come on, princess.

260
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,190
You already have a place to stay.

261
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,360
I don't even have a home now.
You couldn't have just told me?

262
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,780
Alright, I'm busy. I have to go now.

263
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,360
Bye.

264
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,900
Where is Tong Leyi?

265
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,610
You're here.

266
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:37,570
Well,

267
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,900
I'm heading to Chongqing
to visit Director Bai this weekend.

268
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,570
I'll also meet a few partners.

269
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,280
Book the flight and hotel for me, okay?

270
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,230
Can I come with you?

271
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,110
What else?

272
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,360
I can't go there alone.

273
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,610
Of course you're coming.

274
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:50,610
Hurry up and book it.

275
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,400
Okay.

276
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,230
Daji,

277
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,110
this bag really is luxurious.

278
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,360
It looks amazing.

279
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,030
Totally.

280
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,570
I saw a celebrity carrying the same one

281
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,690
on TV just days ago.

282
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,320
This must have cost a fortune.

283
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:02,570
No way.

284
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,530
Overseas boutiques

285
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:04,980
are usually cheaper than here.

286
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,320
How much was it, Daji?

287
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,690
It must be crazy expensive.

288
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,030
Excuse me, Daji.

289
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,150
Can we talk?

290
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,360
What's going on?

291
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,230
Did the computer crash?

292
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,230
What else could it be?

293
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,480
This busted machine...

294
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,530
I got you a new one.

295
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,780
Valentine's Day gift.

296
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,570
That must've cost a lot.

297
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,440
Not really.

298
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,070
It definitely costs far less than your bag.

299
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:33,980
Just take a look.

300
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,650
Wait.

301
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,360
My old one still works fine.

302
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,780
I just need to clear the memory.

303
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,280
- Then, it'll be fine.
- Just open it.

304
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,480
If I wanted one,

305
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,280
I could've bought it while I was abroad.

306
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,880
- This is a local...
- It's different.

307
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,900
I saved something on it.

308
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,530
What is it?

309
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:53,360
Daji,

310
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
are you free tonight?

311
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,280
Yeah.

312
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,400
What is it, Zhaoyang?

313
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,690
Come with me to meet someone.

314
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,530
I'll give you a heads-up.

315
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,030
Daji,

316
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,440
should I wait for you?

317
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:04,900
No need.

318
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,360
I'll drive her home later.

319
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,980
I am Zhou Shui.

320
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,360
I am Dai Daji.

321
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,820
(On January 1st, 2008,)

322
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,650
we fell in love in Beijing.

323
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,230
Zhou Shui,

324
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,280
I'm back.

325
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,820
I...

326
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,820
Do you know who I saw

327
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,820
when I went out today?

328
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,650
I...

329
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:22,860
I...

330
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,070
Chaoyang took me to meet

331
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,820
the top producer

332
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,190
in our entire industry.

333
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:29,650
That...

334
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,840
Why does he keep taking you
to those schmoozy gatherings?

335
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:32,570
Well,

336
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,610
if I don't go,

337
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,940
how am I supposed to meet

338
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,400
these high-level people?

339
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,980
You know this guy.

340
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,190
San Shi from Huayi Pictures.

341
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,360
He wants to partner with us
on a huge project.

342
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,980
They're planning to produce

343
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,110
a road-trip comedy about a taxi driver.

344
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,530
It'll be our company's first

345
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,530
co-produced theatrical release.

346
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,070
A theatrical release!

347
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:57,820
Awesome.

348
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,530
Every movie San Shi has produced

349
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,860
has done great at the box office.

350
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,190
We can't afford to mess this up.

351
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:03,980
Daji,

352
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,070
you wrote the outline

353
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,690
for the taxi driver movie.

354
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:07,860
San Shi really liked it.

355
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,560
(Creative Team)
He wants Bo to star in it.

356
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,440
Bo?

357
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,570
That's all thanks to you.

358
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,480
When did you even write that outline?

359
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,980
Back in Berlin.

360
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,480
Zhaoyang helped me with it.

361
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,150
Zhaoyang?

362
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,610
Zhou Shui,

363
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,860
start brushing up.

364
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,400
Time to do your homework as a director.

365
00:15:23,821 --> 00:15:25,280
(Creative Team. Director: Zhou Shui)

366
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,070
I heard someone wanted to be
a real director.

367
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,040
It's a big job and a big responsibility.

368
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,760
Me? I'm directing it?

369
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,240
- Yeah, that's what Zhaoyang meant.
- You don't want to direct it?

370
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,650
You're the director of this project.

371
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,940
I do want to direct it.

372
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,280
You should thank Zhaoyang.

373
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,110
Don't thank me.

374
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,900
Just be ready to meet Bo anytime.

375
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,030
Okay.

376
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,650
Thanks, Daji.

377
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,570
It's Bo we're talking about.

378
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,820
This is a theatrical release.

379
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,980
(Creative Team. Director: Zhou Shui)

380
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,900
So for this car chase scene,

381
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,480
we need some really professional lenses.

382
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,860
And the kind that can capture fast,

383
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,070
high-speed movements.

384
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,110
Two cars.

385
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,570
Chasing.

386
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,570
Swerving around.

387
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,280
Right at that moment,
my camera swings in from behind them.

388
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,440
Daji,

389
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,860
I just watched
another road movie yesterday.

390
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,480
I broke it down into a storyboard.

391
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,530
This one scene was amazing.

392
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,530
Really powerful.

393
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,230
And our opening is a car scene too.
We could borrow from it.

394
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:38,940
Zhaoyang,

395
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,360
these past few days,

396
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,360
I've really been

397
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,320
getting into this movie.

398
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,480
It's already

399
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,860
coming together in my mind.

400
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,570
Hold on.

401
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,530
What about that short for the hospital?

402
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,440
How's the preparation?
When are you shooting it?

403
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,320
The hospital short?

404
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,120
- What short?
- Yeah.

405
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,900
The Huijia Children's Hospital promo.

406
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,860
I told you about it. Did you forget?

407
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,570
You told me to prepare for the movie?

408
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,900
I've been busy with director stuff.

409
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,980
Well, someone still has to
shoot the short.

410
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,530
You're the only director in the company.

411
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,070
You need to get that shot first, ASAP.

412
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,980
The client's been rushing me nonstop.

413
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,150
If I go do the ad,
who will handle the movie?

414
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,730
Let Daji take over for now.

415
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,820
She wrote the outline anyway.
She knows the project better.

416
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,530
Daji, for the time being,

417
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,940
you'll handle movie preparation.

418
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,570
Alright.

419
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:20,360
Also,

420
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,230
I think it's time to start
writing the script.

421
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,190
You'll be the screenwriter.

422
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,230
You okay?

423
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,900
Just annoyed.

424
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,230
They told me to direct a movie,
and now they want me to shoot a short.

425
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,530
You'll be the director

426
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,640
of a theatrical release.

427
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,940
What's there to be annoyed about?

428
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,650
Just go finish

429
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,940
that short real quick.

430
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,900
Once that's done,

431
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,110
you can throw yourself into the movie.

432
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:56,780
True.

433
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,030
That's why I'm packing up my gear,

434
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,200
and heading to the hospital
to ask how they want it shot.

435
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,900
Good boy.

436
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,280
For the next few days,

437
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,150
I'll help keep an eye
on the movie stuff.

438
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,230
And I'll use the time

439
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,650
to get the script written too.

440
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,650
That way,

441
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,610
we can shoot the movie together.

442
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,190
Being the screenwriter is a big chance.

443
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,570
You got this.

444
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,280
Write it well.

445
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,530
You can do it.

446
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,110
I'm off.

447
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,280
Good luck.

448
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,480
Director,

449
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,730
how was my performance just now?

450
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,320
It was good.

451
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,860
Just keep going with that energy.

452
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,360
Alright. I got that last take.

453
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,400
Now, I'll switch the angle.

454
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,440
Okay, it sounds good.

455
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,070
Alright.

456
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,110
In a bit, pan from
"the Children's Hospital" sign.

457
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,730
Okay?

458
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,690
Give the doctor
an over-the-shoulder shot.

459
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,900
What is taking so long?

460
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,860
Director?

461
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,610
The doctors still have to work.
Don't make it too complicated.

462
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:43,610
Right, I know.

463
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,530
The track's quick to set up, San.

464
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,480
But we're shooting a promo,

465
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,480
not a feature movie.

466
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,070
Time is the priority here.

467
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:52,730
I...

468
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:53,860
Alright, pull the track.

469
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,110
Do as I say.

470
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,320
I'm the one paying for this.

471
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,150
Pull it.

472
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,360
Okay, got it.

473
00:18:59,360 --> 00:18:59,900
Let's pull it.

474
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,440
Quick.

475
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,110
Come on, move.

476
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,440
Alright.

477
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,530
Camera, over here.

478
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,530
Push it forward for me.

479
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,320
Set it right there.

480
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:05,320
Okay, got it.

481
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,440
Come on, bring the cam here.

482
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,150
Alright.

483
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,280
Hello? What's up?

484
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,780
Daji,

485
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,980
can I back out of this promo shoot?

486
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,360
Nope.

487
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,190
Zhaoyang's daughter

488
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,190
wants to see a doctor at this hospital.

489
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,900
But it's hard to get an appointment.

490
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,650
Do you understand?

491
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,530
Got it. I understand.

492
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,600
Alright, lay the track back down.

493
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,780
Backlight him.

494
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,940
Make him look like Tony Leung,
you hear me?

495
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:46,900
Lay the track.

496
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,150
In the fast-paced rhythm of city life,

497
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,940
health is our most valuable treasure.

498
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,480
Our hospital serves as your trusted
guardian of health,

499
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,980
always putting patients first,

500
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,730
offering comprehensive
medical services.

501
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,320
I should call you "Big Shui" now.

502
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,530
What the heck did you just shoot?

503
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,570
Didn't the client make it crystal clear?

504
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,440
Simple. Straightforward. Easy to get.

505
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,400
Why did you give me all these storylines,

506
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,190
all these plots,

507
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:14,900
all these setups?

508
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,690
What for?

509
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:16,900
Well, if they wanted

510
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,730
something you could

511
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,150
shoot on a phone,

512
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,570
then why do they need me at all?

513
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,440
This is not a movie.

514
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:23,860
Now just be straight with me.

515
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,650
Can you do this or not?

516
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,530
- I...
- He can. He can do it.

517
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,030
He just

518
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,480
hasn't fully grasped
what the client wants yet.

519
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,900
Can you really do it?

520
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,980
Yes, I can.

521
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,400
If you really think you can,

522
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,320
then stay late tonight and rework it.

523
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,780
Come up with a new concept.

524
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,560
Keep redoing it
until the client is satisfied.

525
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,530
We'll reshoot after that.

526
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,280
Reshoot it.

527
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,860
Come on, everyone, eat up.

528
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,570
Thanks.

529
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:51,400
Help yourselves.

530
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,610
Thank you, boss.

531
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:53,820
Come on.

532
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,900
Let's raise our glasses.

533
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,820
The most important news today

534
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,230
is that Daji got promoted.

535
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,900
She's now our Planning Director.

536
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,800
She has a new role now.

537
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,320
Should we wait for Zhou Shui?
He's almost here. He's on the way.

538
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,150
He's working late.
Who knows when he'll get here?

539
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,600
Let's have a toast first.
When he gets here, we'll toast again.

540
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,320
Alright, let's go.

541
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,900
Thank you!

542
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,480
It's nothing.

543
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,080
It's not easy.

544
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,080
First proper meal together
in five years? Says who?

545
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,070
Thanks again!

546
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,030
This is good.

547
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,690
Speak of the devil.

548
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,570
We were waiting for you.
Pour him a drink!

549
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,530
Come on, fill it up.

550
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,860
We were just celebrating
Daji's promotion.

551
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,530
Zhou Shui. Come sit by us.

552
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,610
Yeah, sit here.

553
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,280
No worries.

554
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,640
I'm good right here. No trouble.

555
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,820
Zhou Shui's worked hard too.

556
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,980
You've been editing all day.

557
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,480
Come on.

558
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,610
Zhou Shui, keep it up!

559
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:40,730
Let's raise a glass to Daji's promotion.
She's the new Planning Director!

560
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,320
Cheers!

561
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,070
Congrats!

562
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,690
Cheers!

563
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,440
Eat up, Zhou Shui. Have a seat.

564
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,530
We should thank Daji for this meal.

565
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,650
Yeah!

566
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,400
Daji,

567
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,940
your script is amazing.

568
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,230
Absolutely brilliant.

569
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,780
Touching and hilarious.

570
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,530
Really?

571
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,120
Yeah.

572
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,940
It was amazing.

573
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,560
I actually cried at the end.

574
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,320
- For real?
- I cried every time I watched it.

575
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:05,780
You guys are too sweet.

576
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,280
I'm actually

577
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,780
starting to feel a little proud now.

578
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,070
It's the truth.

579
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,320
But the male lead's character

580
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:13,730
still feels a bit flat.

581
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,320
You could try taking inspiration

582
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,610
from Prince Myshkin.

583
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,190
Who?

584
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,360
Go read more books.

585
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,690
Look into Dostoevsky.

586
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:25,070
Huh...

587
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,400
Yeah, I don't know him either.

588
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,610
Dostoevsky

589
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:31,150
is a great Russian writer.

590
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,610
His characters are incredibly deep.

591
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,400
They are worth studying for a lifetime.

592
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,900
Got it.

593
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,980
I'll make a note of it.

594
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,360
Prince Myshkin.

595
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,190
Myshkin.

596
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,360
He's from "The Idiot".

597
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,480
My-shkin.

598
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,360
Myshkin.

599
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,690
Prince Myshkin.

600
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:47,530
For the movie.

601
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,360
For literature.

602
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,690
For Dostoevsky.

603
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,690
To Dostoevsky!

604
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,070
Come on.

605
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,320
Cheers!

606
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,030
Cheers!

607
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,780
To Dostoevsky!

608
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,280
It's chilly. Don't catch a cold.

609
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,070
Zhaoyang, I brought my coat.

610
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,530
I'm good.

611
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,320
Zhaoyang.

612
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,320
Zhaoyang?

613
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,030
And who's this little princess?

614
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,030
Come here!

615
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,360
I missed you so much!

616
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:21,980
So?

617
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,690
Was playing piano with Mommy fun?

618
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:24,680
Come here, give me a hug.

619
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,730
You're happy, right?

620
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:26,720
You played so well today.

621
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:28,900
This is my wife.

622
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,900
And they are the company's rising stars.

623
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,150
Daji and Zhou Shui.
We're counting on them.

624
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,070
Alright, we'll head out then.

625
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:36,900
Your coat.

626
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,860
My coat!

627
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,230
It's chilly. Don't catch a cold.

628
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:39,980
Okay.

629
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,440
- Take care.
- You two keep chatting.

630
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:41,820
Bye!

631
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:42,720
Let's go.

632
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:43,730
So?

633
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,110
Had a good time today?

634
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,280
Wait. This Dostoe...

635
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,650
Do...

636
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,530
What even is this stuff?

637
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,230
Dostoevsky.

638
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,190
I don't get any of it.

639
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,320
Then stop reading.

640
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,820
"The Idiot" has nothing to do

641
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,190
with your script anyway.

642
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,150
But Zhaoyang told me
to reference it for my rewrite.

643
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,360
How am I supposed to do that?

644
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,440
Give me some direction, please.

645
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,730
No real ideas.

646
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:19,570
I'm just going to focus

647
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,280
on doing my own job.

648
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,900
Are you upset?

649
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,190
No, I'm not.

650
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,400
Can you just stop
being so annoyed with him?

651
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,690
He's been good to us.

652
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,070
Sure, he's nice to you.

653
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,240
What's that supposed to mean?

654
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,480
What do I mean?
What does he mean?

655
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,400
What's he trying to do?

656
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,360
I was standing right there today.

657
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,190
It wasn't even cold out.

658
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,360
And he draped his coat
over you in front of me.

659
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,400
Isn't that just him hitting on you?

660
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,190
Hitting on me?

661
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:50,940
You're being ridiculous.

662
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,110
Didn't you see it today?

663
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,780
He was with his wife and kid.

664
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,110
They were so sweet and loving.

665
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,780
Why would he be hitting on me?

666
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,690
Daji.

667
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,400
Let me just say one thing.

668
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,940
Don't go thinking he's a great guy.

669
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,730
That's a bit much, don't you think?

670
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,200
We've been at this company a while now.

671
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,570
If he really had feelings for me,

672
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,070
wouldn't he have made a move by now?

673
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,530
At the very least, dropped a hint?

674
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,570
But, he's never actually
done anything inappropriate.

675
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,070
That's exactly why you don't get it.

676
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,570
Oh, I don't? But you do?

677
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,440
Well, men understand men best.

678
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:23,900
Is that so?

679
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,440
Look.

680
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:38,440
I know you've been frustrated lately.

681
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,650
Right?

682
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,920
Because of this...

683
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,360
They won't let you direct the movie.

684
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,730
They threw the ad shoots your way.

685
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,530
Of course you're upset.

686
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,360
But look on the bright side.

687
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,530
You're the only director in the company.

688
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,480
That movie is going
to be yours eventually.

689
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,900
Just hang in there.

690
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,280
Isn't that Takeshi Kaneshiro?

691
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,110
Yeah, we literally made him
look like Takeshi Kaneshiro.

692
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,070
That's why we have to reshoot.

693
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,530
No, I mean you...

694
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,730
Don't cut off the top of his head.
Tilt up.

695
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,530
Alright, this angle works.

696
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,690
Okay.

697
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,230
Director.

698
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,400
After this shoot,

699
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,730
we shouldn't need another, right?

700
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,780
This'll be the last.

701
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,570
Alright, lock this shot.

702
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,440
Alright. Get ready.

703
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:30,480
Daji.

704
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,110
Where are you?

705
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,110
Reshooting

706
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,030
at the hospital.

707
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,780
No one told you we're having a meeting?

708
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,650
What meeting?

709
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,440
The movie meeting.

710
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,940
The investors are all here.
You're the only one missing.

711
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,690
Right now?

712
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
Get over here, quick.

713
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,320
Thank you, Mr. San Shi.

714
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,150
Having you on board

715
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,480
really puts my mind at ease.

716
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,040
Without you, putting this team together
would've been a struggle.

717
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,980
Mr. San Shi was my guide
into this industry.

718
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:59,280
That scene in 1999?

719
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,480
I remember it like it was yesterday.

720
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,320
Anyway,

721
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,980
let's get down to business.

722
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,690
For this movie,

723
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,690
if we're aiming
for big box office numbers,

724
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,230
we have to go all in.

725
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,480
You're up next. Get ready.

726
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,230
Our creative team

727
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,110
has to be made up
of the best in the industry.

728
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,230
As for the director,

729
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,320
he's the brilliant and talented

730
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,650
Hong Kong, China director, Wu Yuqiang.

731
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,300
(Creative Team. Director: Wu Yuqiang)

732
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,610
Thanks to Mr. San Shi,

733
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,230
we finally got him on board

734
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,030
- How can this be?
- after much convincing.

735
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,730
If we hadn't finalized it yesterday,
I wouldn't announce it today.

736
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,820
He's internationally renowned.

737
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,110
In the past few years,
Director Wu Yuqiang

738
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,320
has topped the box office
four years in a row.

739
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,440
We hope this project

740
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,570
will help us clinch
a fifth win together.

741
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,610
Great.

742
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:49,030
Why are you here?
Aren't you supposed to be on set?

743
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,800
Do you know the client's
been waiting forever?

744
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,690
I joined this company

745
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,440
to make movies.

746
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,440
What, we didn't let you?

747
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,640
I didn't sign up to schmooze doctors
for your daughter.

748
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,840
How is this about my daughter?

749
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,440
What did you say
when you first joined us?

750
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,680
You said we'd be making a movie.

751
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,360
- And you didn't?
- What am I shooting now?

752
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:01,940
- Ads.
- Promos!

753
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,610
Ads!

754
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,280
How many times have you sold me a dream?

755
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,360
Listen up.

756
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,860
I'm done with this lousy ad.

757
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,920
If you're so capable,
go find another director.

758
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,690
You think you're the only director
I can use?

759
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,280
Fine.

760
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,070
Go look, then.

761
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,980
Go find someone.

762
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,900
Let's see if you can.

763
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,570
Daji.

764
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,230
Have you thought about
becoming a director?

765
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,520
As long as Zhou Shui is the director.

766
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,480
I could see it long ago.

767
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,820
Daji has what it takes to direct.

768
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,980
She's just as good as you.

769
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,730
When did Daji ever say
she wanted to direct?

770
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,900
She's always helping you.

771
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,570
Do you think the way you two split work

772
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,440
is really fair?

773
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,980
Have you thought
about her future at all?

774
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,840
She's put everything into your career.

775
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,880
All this time here,
what have you ever done for her?

776
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,000
Have you thought about that?

777
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,240
We joined this company together.

778
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,960
We both wanted to make movies.
We're a team.

779
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,650
So what?

780
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,070
Listen up!

781
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,730
You have no right to judge us.

782
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,820
Zhou Shui, you are so selfish.

783
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,900
Daji is more mature than you.

784
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,320
If you ask me,
she's the real director here.

785
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,900
She's the one directing
behind the scenes.

786
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,690
She's the one directing Zhou Shui.

787
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,610
Without her, could you have done it?

788
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,400
Without you,

789
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,730
couldn't she make it?

790
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,150
What are you trying to say?

791
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:12,530
Daji,

792
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,530
once you're done with this script,

793
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,320
I will back you as director

794
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,150
for our next project.

795
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,530
(Because we were a team,)

796
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,900
(so was it always supposed to be
me who steps aside?)

797
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,440
(Over time,)

798
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,980
(I almost forgot myself.)

799
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,070
(I am Dai Daji.)

800
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,070
(I am not Zhou Shui's Dai Daji.)

801
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,820
(As I looked at her standing still,)

802
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,690
(the five meters between us)

803
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,730
(felt like)

804
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,530
(the farthest distance of all.)

805
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:47,530
Daji.

806
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:50,480
Making a movie means dealing
with tens of millions in budget.

807
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,400
They won't

808
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,280
let a young person direct it.

809
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,440
And you saw it too.

810
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,280
Zhou Shui is far too immature.

811
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,030
If you stick with me,

812
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,610
I always keep my word.

813
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,480
I'll make sure you direct the next film.

814
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,530
What about Zhou Shui?

815
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,730
Running a company is not charity work.

816
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,530
Between the two of you,
I can only support one.

817
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:10,530
And I

818
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,730
choose you.

819
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:16,530
Hello?

820
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:17,820
What?

821
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,190
He still hasn't shown up?

822
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,030
Sorry.

823
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,070
I'll take care of it.

824
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,230
What were we saying?

825
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,280
What's going on?
Where on earth is Zhou Shui?

826
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,040
The folks at the hospital
are waiting for him.

827
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,530
I'm telling you, I don't have time.

828
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:32,650
Five more minutes, that's it.

829
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:33,800
I can't wait. I really can't.

830
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,040
Sorry.

831
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,570
I have to go.

832
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,280
We'll start ASAP.

833
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,070
I'm so sorry!

834
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,610
Director Zhou isn't feeling well.

835
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:38,900
I'll shoot. I'll direct.

836
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,690
Everyone, get ready to start.

837
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,200
Hurry, hurry.

838
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,070
Alright, let's shoot.

839
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,400
Sorry.

840
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
Sorry for the delay.

841
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,230
I promise it will be finished quickly.

842
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,360
Okay, get ready.

843
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:50,280
Alright.

844
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:50,780
Director.

845
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,650
I am ready.

846
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:52,480
Alright.

847
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,150
Okay, get ready.

848
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:56,940
Three, two, one, action.

849
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,980
As a senior pediatrician,

850
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,690
I have worked in pediatrics

851
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,190
for over 20 years.

852
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,980
I have a deep understanding

853
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,480
of pediatric medicine.

854
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:09,780
(Erguotou)

855
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,530
Are you drinking?

856
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,070
You're actually drinking at home?

857
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,570
I worked so hard

858
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,820
to finish that ad shoot for you,

859
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,610
and here you are drinking at home?

860
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,980
I've already packed my stuff.

861
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:49,730
I'll finish
this bottle of liquor tonight,

862
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,190
then I'll leave.

863
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,730
Whatever.

864
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,150
What do you mean "whatever"?

865
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,840
Daji. You're not even gonna talk to me now?

866
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,280
You want...

867
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,600
- What do you mean whatever?
- If you want to make a scene,

868
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,400
go outside, alright?

869
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,320
I have work to do.
I need to export the footage.

870
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:07,360
You...

871
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,730
What are you trying to do?

872
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,530
I know you think I'm useless.

873
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:13,190
Fine.

874
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:17,070
Let's go with the usual rule.
Once I finish this bottle, we break up.

875
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,780
Zhou Shui, can you just grow up?

876
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,190
I am immature.

877
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:22,780
This is who I am, so what?

878
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,570
Fine, you can throw a fit,
just keep the liquor away.

879
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,980
Don't ruin my computer.

880
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,440
Stupid computer.

881
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,360
Zhou Shui, listen.

882
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,960
That computer cost you over nine grand.

883
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,780
It is brand new.

884
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,980
I am really going to drink it.
I really will.

885
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:38,530
Fine, go ahead.

886
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:39,980
There is no turning back.

887
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,440
Dai Daji.

888
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,480
I am opening the bottle for real now.
Seriously.

889
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,690
Drink, go ahead.

890
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,360
I am really doing it. I opened it.

891
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,150
Yes, drink it.

892
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,570
Trust me, if I drink this tonight,

893
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,720
I'm leaving for good.

894
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,650
I will never come back.

895
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,570
Fine. When you leave,

896
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,730
take the trash out too.

897
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,860
Why are you not playing by the script?

898
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,000
I told you, I am really tired today.

899
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,530
I need to export the footage.
I still have to do the rough cut.

900
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,320
- I seriously don't have time for this.
- Fine.

901
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:04,940
Then, I won't drink.

902
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,400
I'll just stay here and annoy you
so you can't edit.

903
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,040
Seriously, Zhou Shui.

904
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,800
You can't edit now.

905
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,440
Can you stop
acting like a three-year-old?

906
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,110
Wait.

907
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,230
I get it now.

908
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:16,190
You're pulling this stunt on purpose.

909
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:19,190
Trying to make me think
you're too scared to break up with me.

910
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,150
Listen up!

911
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:20,610
Just now,

912
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,530
on the way home from the office,

913
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,280
I had it all figured out in my head.

914
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,730
I'm going to finish this bottle
and break up with you.

915
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,820
Don't you want to know
why I want to break up?

916
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,190
What's that look?

917
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,190
I'm asking you.

918
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:39,730
Don't you know

919
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,190
why I want to break up with you?

920
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,320
Come on, talk to me.

921
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,440
Why the silent treatment?

922
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,900
Why won't you listen to me?

923
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,980
I am listening.

924
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,480
Aren't you even curious

925
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,730
why I want to break up?

926
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,320
I guess I am.

927
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,360
Okay.

928
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:57,860
Ask me.

929
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,230
Why do I want to break up with you?

930
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,190
May I know why you're
breaking up with me?

931
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,480
It's because I think...

932
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,440
I think you don't love me anymore.

933
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,530
I can't even shoot a proper movie.

934
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,980
I'm no longer able to make movies.

935
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,530
And I screwed up that promo too.

936
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,780
Right now, there's nothing left in me

937
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,230
that you could possibly love, Daji.

938
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,230
Listen to me, Daji.

939
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,980
I don't want your credit cards.

940
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,070
I don't want your down jackets.

941
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,940
And I won't date anyone else.

942
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,150
Not in this lifetime.

943
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,900
I just want you.

944
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,530
My name is Dai Daji.

945
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,190
My name is Zhou Shui.

946
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,900
On January 1st, 2008,

947
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,110
at exactly midnight,

948
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,190
we fell in love in Beijing.

949
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,320
I know what our movie script
should be called.

950
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:53,940
What is it?

951
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,440
It's "Such a Good Love".

952
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,780
One-year anniversary.

953
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,230
A real anniversary.

954
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,190
A full year, for real.

955
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,530
Zhou Shui, I just like you.

956
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,110
When you talk about your dreams,

957
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,860
you shine like a star.

958
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,570
(Zhou Shui.)

959
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,820
I've always believed
that the most important thing

960
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,480
about being a girlfriend is loyalty.

961
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:22,820
So. I won't let you down.

962
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,730
You're not allowed
to let me down either, okay?

963
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:26,650
You won't let me down.

964
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,650
And I won't let you down!

965
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,230
Let me ask you one last time.

966
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:46,570
Do you love me or not?

967
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:47,320
I do.

968
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,110
I love you.

969
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,190
From beginning to end.

970
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,360
For real?

971
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,530
(I'll give you a one-of-a-kind wedding.)

972
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,530
(A wedding just for us.)

973
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,280
(That will be our ending.)

974
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,230
(But if we start living like that,)

975
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,440
(would we still be the same?)

976
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,730
(Of course.)

977
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,280
Of course we would.

978
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,940
We'll always be us.

979
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,730
Never change!

980
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,190
That night,

981
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,980
we didn't finish the rest of the liquor.

982
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,030
We made up.

983
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,230
Just like we used to.

984
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,230
But in my memory,

985
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,900
that was the last time
we were truly close.

986
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,480
Because from then on,

987
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,980
everything started
to fall apart beyond repair.

988
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:43,690
The truth is, I knew

989
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,110
he never actually
meant to break up that night.

990
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,070
He just used that childish way

991
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,650
to get my attention.

992
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,320
I wanted so badly to explain.

993
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,230
I wasn't trying to ignore him.

994
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,030
And I definitely wasn't

995
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:04,400
falling for Chaoyang as he thought.

996
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:06,940
It was just that

997
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,610
for the first time in my life,

998
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,860
my talent and my work
were finally recognized.

999
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:16,070
I felt like I had found my worth.

1000
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,980
I wanted to share that joy with him.

1001
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,110
But he...

1002
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,690
He thought I had stolen his dream.

1003
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,440
(Autumn 2024, Chongqing)
Director, how late are we shooting?

1004
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,150
(Autumn 2024, Chongqing)

1005
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,780
The actors are already like this...

1006
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,190
I get it.

1007
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,190
Well, they're big names, after all.

1008
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,030
Might as well just let it go.

1009
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:39,570
Over here.

1010
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,070
You didn't even give a heads-up?

1011
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,360
What? Not happy to see me?

1012
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,070
Of course I am! Always happy to see you.

1013
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,480
What brings you here this time?

1014
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:47,900
Business trip?

1015
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:49,780
Look.

1016
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:53,940
Wait, who's that?

1017
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,530
Alright, looks good.

1018
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:55,730
Cool.

1019
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,530
Let's shoot this and move on.

1020
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:58,650
Dai Daji.

1021
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,730
That is the legend herself, wow.

1022
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,440
I've heard a big piece of gossip too.

1023
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,650
- Seems like...
- What gossip?

1024
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,000
She's got things going on
with Mr. Zhang.

1025
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,230
They might be getting engaged.

1026
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,610
Looks like you were right.

1027
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,610
She chose money in the end.

1028
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,530
Drop it, let's grab some food.

1029
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:13,940
Okay.

1030
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:14,980
Tong Leyi.

1031
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:16,900
Where are you going?

1032
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,440
Ms. Dai, well...

1033
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,280
Weren't you having dinner
with the director?

1034
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,960
I thought I could eat with my friend.

1035
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,400
- Hello, Ms. Dai.
- This your friend?

1036
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,360
Nice to meet you.

1037
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,110
We were supposed
to have dinner tonight,

1038
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:28,030
but they said the schedule's too tight,

1039
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,530
so dinner's off.

1040
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:30,940
What are you two going to eat?

1041
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,280
- Hotpot.
- Hotpot.

1042
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,110
Hotpot, huh?

1043
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,070
Is it good?

1044
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:35,780
Not bad.

1045
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,320
Ms. Dai, why don't you come with us?

1046
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,080
You two are on a date.
It wouldn't be right.

1047
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:39,900
We're not a couple.

1048
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,190
Nope.

1049
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:40,940
Come on, join us.

1050
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,820
Yeah, come with us.

1051
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,720
- Let's go.
- Alright.

1052
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,530
Why is it so packed?

1053
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,030
Business is good, huh?

1054
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:48,900
Yeah, Ms. Dai.

1055
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,690
This place is really popular locally.

1056
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,820
But, it's a last-minute thing.
We didn't book.

1057
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,160
This is way too crowded.

1058
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,980
Should we try another place?

1059
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,940
No, I'm starving.

1060
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,530
It's fine.

1061
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,360
Crowd just means the food is good.

1062
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,570
We're already here, let's wait.

1063
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,400
Alright, sure.

1064
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:05,900
Sorry about this.

1065
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,900
It's fine, really.

1066
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,530
Isn't he the same guy

1067
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,440
you video-called?

1068
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:10,940
Right?

1069
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,030
He's my companion.

1070
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,530
What does that mean?

1071
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,570
You young people are so weird.

1072
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,900
Boyfriend is boyfriend.

1073
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,030
Friend is friend.

1074
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,480
What's a companion?

1075
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:22,070
It's like a stand-in
for a real relationship.

1076
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,530
Like how you watch game streams

1077
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:25,230
instead of playing the game yourself.

1078
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,530
You don't have to join in.

1079
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,860
But, I feel like you've already
jumped in yourself.

1080
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,030
When did I jump in?

1081
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:33,980
Haven't you?

1082
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,280
You were so eager
to join this trip to Chongqing.

1083
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,110
Isn't it because

1084
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,570
someone you like is here?

1085
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:39,150
Right?

1086
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,570
I'm gonna check

1087
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:42,570
how long the wait is.

1088
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:43,610
You two carry on.

1089
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:44,690
Get me a soda too.

1090
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:45,530
Sure, no problem.

1091
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:46,570
Where are you going?

1092
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,070
Bathroom.

1093
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,280
Feeling nervous?

1094
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,070
Not at all.

1095
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,320
She's so nosy, seriously.

1096
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,440
Don't get the wrong idea.
I am just here for work.

1097
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,320
Fine.

1098
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,150
Don't overthink it.

1099
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,690
Are you the owner?

1100
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,780
Where's the restroom?

1101
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,530
Over there.

1102
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:02,360
That way.

1103
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:03,360
Go ahead.

1104
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:06,230
Excuse me, how much longer is the wait?

1105
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,360
You're up next.

1106
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,150
Great, thanks.

1107
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,570
To the left.

1108
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,400
Okay.

1109
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,900
How about we start ordering now
so the food comes out sooner?

1110
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,820
Let's wait and order together.

1111
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:22,230
Hey, look.

1112
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,320
Is that who I think it is?

1113
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,440
- What do you think? Is it him?
- Who?

1114
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,230
The cook. Doesn't he look familiar?

1115
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,070
I'm not seeing things, right?

1116
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,110
I can't see the face. Who is it?

1117
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:36,690
Is that Zhou Shui?

1118
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,070
It really is him.

1119
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:42,780
It is, right?

Boss!

1126
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,110
- Coming!

1127
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,800
