3
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,260
(Summer 2009)

4
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,060
(Beijing)
I mined two of them yesterday.

5
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:55,180
Two? That's too little.

6
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,350
I already mined five.

7
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,900
Really?

8
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,230
Five.

9
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,990
What are you guys murmuring about?

10
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,510
Old Chives.

11
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,460
Do you know what a Bitcoin is?

12
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,350
What?

13
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,470
Bitcoin.

14
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,910
Bitcoin!

15
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,100
The currency
of the future digital era.

16
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,750
It's money.

17
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,980
Listen.

18
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,100
What we're doing right now
is mining Bitcoin.

19
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,750
We can mine over ten of them in one day.

20
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,580
We'll strike it rich soon.

21
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,310
Shut up. Wait a second.

22
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,230
Nobody talks.

23
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,260
My superior is calling me.

24
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,190
Dai Daji.

25
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,230
Yes, Director Wen.

26
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,700
Have you prepared the materials?

27
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,540
Yes.

28
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,660
I've sent it

29
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,510
to your email two days ago.

30
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,350
Have you seen it?

31
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:33,910
Okay.

32
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,370
Understood.

33
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,100
I'll send you now.

34
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,030
I'm in a meeting now.

35
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,030
I'll head to the company now.

36
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,910
Alright. No problem.

37
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,820
What kind of stupid job is this?

38
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,660
It's a decent job.

39
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,580
Decent job?

40
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,950
I'm not even an official employee.

41
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,190
I have to slave away every day.

42
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,060
Loads of works to do!

43
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,100
- The more capable you are, the more...
- Shut up.

44
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,190
Daji.

45
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,100
Daji,

46
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,540
I have something to tell you.

47
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,100
No.

48
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,790
Not today.

49
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,690
I have to go to work.

50
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:55,310
No time for it.

51
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,420
Talk to you after work.

52
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,190
Aren't you working today?

53
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,510
I am.

54
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,100
There's no rush.

55
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,190
Director Zhou.

56
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,030
You have to work extra hard.

57
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,660
I might quit this lousy job

58
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,580
at any time.

59
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,350
You have to hang in there,

60
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:16,980
okay?

61
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:17,950
Hang in there,

62
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,630
okay?

63
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,310
See you.

64
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,750
Take care.

65
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,310
See you.

66
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,190
- Hang in there.
- Yeah.

67
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,070
We have to upgrade our equipment.

68
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,380
The more time we spend on it,

69
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,030
the more we may get...

70
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,580
Hey. I realized something lately.

71
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,470
Why aren't you guys

72
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,910
proactive at work at all?

73
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,380
The topics we chose

74
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,630
were uninteresting.

75
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,510
The production side
kept delaying their deadline.

76
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,310
What's going on?

77
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,070
Look at my glass.

78
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,820
No one's even pouring water now.

79
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,070
What's wrong with you interns?

80
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,540
Why didn't you do that?

81
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,860
How could you be an official employee?

82
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,140
Our head was drinking tea.

83
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,910
Get him some hot water.

84
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,860
You're so dumb.

85
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,260
Stop it!

86
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,780
You.

87
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:28,820
Tell me.

88
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,110
How many people do we have here?

89
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,020
14...

90
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,550
There are 14 of us.

91
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,700
You can't even
do basic Math, huh? My boss.

92
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,900
How many hands do we have?

93
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,430
28.

94
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,780
28, right?

95
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,310
We have 28 hands here.

96
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,580
But no one here
can pour him some water?

97
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,780
Disabled?

98
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,020
Cripple?

99
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,820
Show me your handicap ID.

100
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,670
But you guys are interns.

101
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,310
Does that mean
we have to serve you like a servant?

102
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,020
Take out the contract.

103
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,700
Which of the clauses state
that interns have to serve you?

104
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,700
I'm a graduate from a related field!

105
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,220
Buddy, I came here to learn something.

106
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,670
Use your brain and think.

107
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,380
I studied for 22 years.

108
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,380
Do you think I'm here
to serve you, a man

109
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,220
from a trash school?

110
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,550
That's obviously not the case.

111
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,460
What are you thinking?

112
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,580
You think you're popular

113
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,260
just because you're wearing
a good shirt?

114
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,670
I would've ended my own life

115
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,550
if I were like you in my thirties.

116
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,430
The coffee has arrived.

117
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,700
Don't pick it up.

118
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,580
Bring it here.

119
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,900
The interns are excluded again.

120
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,460
You only order seven cups
of coffee every time.

121
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,140
You were too stingy
to order Starbucks.

122
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,700
A few cups of Nestle espresso
should be fine, right?

123
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,430
Aren't interns living humans?

124
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,780
I'll order them for you now.

125
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,070
No need for that!

126
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,020
All of you

127
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,990
are fired.

128
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,340
And you.

129
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,020
You're dumped.

130
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,550
Let's go.

131
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:16,990
Let's go.

132
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,870
Come on.

133
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,190
I...

134
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:22,670
I...

135
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,820
Spineless.

136
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,220
You won't achieve anything.

137
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,780
You didn't take your snacks.

138
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,550
Give me your hand.

139
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,310
What?

140
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,630
Just extend your hand.

141
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,950
The water dispenser is empty.
Why is no one refilling it?

142
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:13,870
I'll do it.

143
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,340
No need for that.

144
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,780
You go ahead. I'll do it myself.

145
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,220
I'll do it.

146
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,310
I can do it myself.

147
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,870
- That's right.
- Okay.

148
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,460
You go ahead.

149
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,750
Dai Daji, come here immediately!

150
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,460
Get ready to be an official employee.

151
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,040
Tell the HR Department
to do your paperwork

152
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,900
for social insurance and housing fund.

153
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,670
Thank you, Director Wen.

154
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,430
Leave the water on my desk.

155
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,630
I'll leave it here.

156
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,020
I shouldn't have hired those
who were born in the 80's.

157
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,460
I'm so unlucky.

158
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,070
(In 2009,)

159
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,550
(the employment work target task
has been overfulfilled.)

160
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,950
(The number of new
urban employment nationwide)

161
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,510
(is 1,102.)

162
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,310
Jingshu.

163
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,240
Dongting.

164
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,060
It's your first time
asking me out for a meal.

165
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,020
Do you need anything?

166
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,220
Mainly, I want to pay the money back.

167
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,460
I want to treat you to a meal as well.

168
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,190
You don't need to pay me back.

169
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,550
Pay your school fees with it.

170
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,820
Nope.

171
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,670
You're Jingjing's boyfriend.

172
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,670
I shouldn't have borrowed it from you.

173
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,700
Jingshu.

174
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,340
Don't you understand my intention?

175
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,730
I'll stop beating around the bush.

176
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,820
I like you.

177
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,500
I want to be together with you.

178
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,100
What are you talking about?

179
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,220
You have a girlfriend.

180
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,220
I'll deal with Jingjing somehow.

181
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,190
I truly fancy you.

182
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,700
And, this sum was supposed
to be your school fees anyway.

183
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,910
Our family has
an apartment near Xuezhiqiao.

184
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,390
- You don't need to...
- Li Dongting!

185
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,220
I didn't believe them
when they exposed you.

186
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,030
How could you mess around with her?

187
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,500
What are you talking about?

188
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,910
What am I talking about?

189
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,070
What are you talking about?

190
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:26,620
I...

191
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,070
I didn't say anything.

192
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,100
Just lent her some money.

193
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,270
Stop lying to me!

194
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,220
I heard everything you guys said!

195
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,620
Jingjing, you're mistaken.

196
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,150
Can you have some empathy for once?

197
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,860
Jingshu is born into a poor family.
She's having a rough time.

198
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,670
What's wrong with lending her money?

199
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,270
Are you sure you're helping her?

200
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,270
You're just trying to court her!

201
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,860
Forget it. You should stop.

202
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,190
Let go of me!

203
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,340
You ingrate!

204
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,190
I paid for your dorm!

205
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,950
I gave you everything you wore!

206
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:55,910
I was nice to you!

207
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,100
Why did you still seduce my boyfriend?

208
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,100
Enough already!

209
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,220
Li Dongting, have you lost your mind?

210
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,910
Why must it be her?

211
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,860
You're unreasonable!

212
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,100
Why?

213
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,390
Stop crying.

214
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,910
It's a misunderstanding.

215
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,150
Let me explain...

216
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,100
A misunderstanding?

217
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,430
Stop pretending.

218
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,580
I'll show everyone your true colors.

219
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:43,910
Here she is.

220
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,130
- Jingjing.
- She's here.

221
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,010
She's here.

222
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,820
Come! Everyone, let's do a kind deed!

223
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,950
Shen Jingshu, a student
majoring in Accounting,

224
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,550
is unable to pay her school fees
due to her poor background.

225
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,700
Please donate to her if you can.

226
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,310
- Hurry!
- Come!

227
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,310
Donate to her!

228
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,820
Come on, everyone!

229
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,550
Why are you going?

230
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,310
- Don't leave.
- Don't leave.

231
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,860
I think Jingshu is shy.

232
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,820
- She doesn't want girls' money.
- Don't leave.

233
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,340
Don't go.

234
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,910
- Guys, do a kind deed.
- Where are you going?

235
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,980
If so, why aren't you taking our money?

236
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,670
Do you think money
is the only thing she wants?

237
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,390
What she desires is love.

238
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,270
Do you have to do this?

239
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,270
What? You think
you still have any dignity left?

240
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,070
Don't leave.

241
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,150
Just leave. Hurry.

242
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,740
Shen Jingshu, open the door!

243
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,390
Let me see which room you're living in.

244
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,310
Hurry!

245
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,430
Let's start the party!

246
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,040
Jingshu?

247
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,390
Let's see

248
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,590
what the room of a fallen girl

249
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,930
- looks like.
- Who are you guys?

250
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:45,670
Who are you?

251
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,780
Who said you could come in?

252
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,500
Stop!

253
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,550
Look at the camera.

254
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,340
What are you doing?

255
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,340
Who said you could come in?

256
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,200
Your room is so pink!

257
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,100
What are you doing?

258
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,460
Stop filming!

259
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,580
- Let me see!
- Stop!

260
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,270
Stop!

261
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:57,910
Do you know

262
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,620
what your girlfriend has done in school?

263
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,620
What are you saying?

264
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,910
She's not my girlfriend.

265
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,270
- She's not?
- But you guys are co-cohabiting.

266
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,150
None of your concern!

267
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,150
Sleeping on the same bed!

268
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:07,950
Stop filming!

269
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,700
Three, two, one!

270
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,500
What is that?

271
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:12,790
There you go.

272
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,340
That's the scene I want.

273
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,030
See you on the forum tonight.

274
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:16,950
Get out!

275
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:17,620
Goodbye.

276
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,430
Jingjing, let me see it.

277
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,620
Show me your pictures.

278
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,310
Jingshu.

279
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,620
Jingshu?

280
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,100
Wait, Jingshu.

281
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,980
Who are they?

282
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,270
Jingshu, don't cry.

283
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,270
What are they up to?

284
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,340
(Hiring screenwriters and editors)

285
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,270
Hello, Daji.

286
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,430
Shui.

287
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,100
Are you busy?

288
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,100
I'm busy now.

289
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,310
I'm in the middle of a job.

290
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,740
When will you get off work?

291
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,090
How about we dine outside tonight?

292
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,310
I might be late today.

293
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,220
Why don't you go ahead without me?

294
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,670
So...

295
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,220
Congratulations.

296
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,100
Hey.

297
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,220
I need to answer a call.

298
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,620
I'll resume the shooting later.

299
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:38,620
If so,

300
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:39,910
don't tire yourself out.

301
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:40,980
Remember to have meal.

302
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,220
Don't worry.

303
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,030
The wedding dinner is fancy.

304
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,340
They're serving salmon,

305
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,550
abalones, all kinds of fancy food.

306
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,270
Really?

307
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,430
You should pack some for me, then.

308
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,430
Next station, Wangfujing.

309
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,950
Hello?

310
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,150
Hello?

311
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,340
Daji.

312
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,220
You see,

313
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,620
my signal was lost just now.

314
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,310
Why don't I call you back later?

315
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:10,820
Okay?

316
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,190
I'll resume my shooting first.

317
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,220
Goodbye.

318
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:52,790
Glasses.

319
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,240
What?

320
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,580
We can't pay the electricity bill.

321
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,460
We overspent.

322
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,150
We're doing this to make money.

323
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,670
Let's move it inside first.

324
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,070
Hurry up.

325
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,460
Heroine,

326
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,790
interested in Bitcoin?

327
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:10,950
Wanna know more?

328
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:11,870
No thanks.

329
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,980
It'll make you a fortune.

330
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,270
She's being so secretive.
What's she up to?

331
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,030
Just now,

332
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,390
I was very angry at him.

333
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,980
But when I saw him

334
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,790
hiding in the corner like that,

335
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,740
I suddenly felt heartbroken.

336
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,550
I'm sure he has lost all of his dignity.

337
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,090
That's why he doesn't dare to face me.

338
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,670
Now, I can't bear to be angry at him.

339
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,430
I shouldn't expose him.

340
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,150
I'll just pretend
that I didn't see him.

341
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,550
How could I forget about my documents?

342
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:22,550
I...

343
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,620
Finally, got you.

344
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,620
I should return to the office.

345
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:40,100
(Pulp Fiction)

346
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,580
I've been thinking about

347
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,620
the 50,000 yuan.

348
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,080
I wanted to find an opportunity
to tell her.

349
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,700
I've lost all of my money.

350
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,260
I've lost my job as well.

351
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,300
But I don't know how to break it to her.

352
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,630
What I'm more afraid of

353
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,430
is that if I say it,

354
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,020
our lives won't be able to go on.

355
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,260
Long left without turning back

356
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,530
after arguing with our superiors.

357
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,110
Then Director Wen told me

358
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,700
that I had become
an official employee.

359
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,190
That's it.

360
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,390
Are four of them enough?

361
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,590
It's enough, right?

362
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,490
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

363
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,110
The whole story is just like a movie.

364
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,870
You see,

365
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,020
I hated Long

366
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,150
before this.

367
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,740
But when he was lecturing our superiors,

368
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,980
I suddenly realized

369
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,390
that he was pretty cool.

370
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,300
It made me look at him
in a different light.

371
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,830
But doesn't that mean
he has lost his job?

372
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,780
So what?

373
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,460
He can find another job.

374
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,980
You can definitely find a better job

375
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,700
as long as you're capable.

376
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,560
Who knows? You might rise steadily

377
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,500
after this.

378
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,110
It's better than

379
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,300
doing the job you hate.

380
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,260
Was the view in Beijing this amazing?

381
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,390
We pass by here every day.

382
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,700
Why have I not realized
that the view here was impeccable?

383
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,190
You should've taken your DV with you.

384
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,540
If so, you can film some materials.

385
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,540
Daji.

386
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,590
I have something to tell you.

387
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,150
Go ahead.

388
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,060
Actually, I should've
told you this long ago.

389
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,740
But I didn't know
how to break it to you.

390
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,350
However, I think

391
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,430
I have to tell you this today.

392
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,350
Tell me.

393
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,500
I lost my job.

394
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,910
I knew that long ago.

395
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,060
You knew?

396
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:15,670
Yeah.

397
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,460
How did you know?

398
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,060
It doesn't matter. Anyway, I found out.

399
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,740
I told you this before, right?

400
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,750
If you lose your job,
you can find another one.

401
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,500
I have a proper job now.

402
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,240
It's fine.

403
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,220
We still got our savings.

404
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,110
Don't be stressed out.

405
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,630
I lost our savings as well.

406
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,700
How could that happen?

407
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,630
Do you remember I told you

408
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,460
that I wanted to invest our 50,000 yuan
into private equity last week?

409
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,110
Yeah.

410
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,220
What happened?

411
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,020
Although you didn't agree,

412
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,390
I still invested with the money.

413
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,220
And then?

414
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,220
Reverb lost all of it.

415
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,740
The company closed down because of her.

416
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,780
Our money is gone as well.

417
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,390
Daji.

418
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,950
Daji, I'm sorry.

419
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,430
I know that it's my fault.

420
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,110
But back then,
I was blinded by my greed.

421
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,950
I thought...

422
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:10,870
I thought I could

423
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,110
make money.

424
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,740
That's why I invested the money.

425
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:14,980
Daji, I'm sorry.

426
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,190
Don't tell me you want
to break up.

427
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,150
You're overthinking it.

428
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,150
I'm just trying to control myself

429
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,020
from throwing you off the bridge.

430
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,430
It's fine. I'll do it myself.

431
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,970
As long as you don't break up with me.

432
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:34,980
Enough.

433
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,190
We just lost our savings,

434
00:20:59,150 --> 00:20:59,950
right?

435
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,980
It's no big deal.

436
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,540
Do you think I'm that petty?

437
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,830
You think I'll get angry?

438
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:09,190
I think it's quite a huge deal.

439
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,220
And, Daji, you're quite strong.

440
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,430
I'm so sorry.

441
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,980
Forget it.

442
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,540
So what if we've lost our savings?

443
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,390
We were penniless from the start anyway.

444
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,110
Am I right?

445
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,350
Maybe we're just

446
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,460
"Scandalous Couple".

447
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,150
We have to suck it up

448
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,190
to make money.

449
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,740
Just start from scratch, right?

450
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,020
It's not a huge deal.

451
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,150
A few days ago, my senior told me

452
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,780
that he knew someone.

453
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,780
He can get you to the TV station.

454
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,540
The TV station?

455
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,230
Yeah. Why not ask him
to get you there?

456
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,060
What can I do there?

457
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:11,350
It's related to
the movie industry too, you know?

458
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,950
You can stay useful there.

459
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,130
Or, just pick up a new skill.

460
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,190
But your senior isn't that reliable.

461
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,670
Shouldn't you give it a try

462
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,740
before saying that?

463
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,780
Do you have any other choice?

464
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,020
Do you have a choice?

465
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,390
Is that right?

466
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,500
Look at you.

467
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,300
You're pulling such a long face.

468
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:42,150
Although you've lost our savings,

469
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,540
your job,

470
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,950
and you have nothing
except for your talents,

471
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,670
in my heart,

472
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,700
you're still
the brilliant Director Zhou.

473
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,060
You didn't change at all.

474
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,780
Daji.

475
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:01,910
I love you.

476
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,460
Don't mention it.

477
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,110
Alright. I've forgiven you.

478
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,830
I'm not angry at you anymore.

479
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,830
Enough already.
Stop being so wishy-washy.

480
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,910
Look at the vast sky.

481
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,300
Look at the giant city.

482
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,390
Isn't it amazing?

483
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,780
Let's work hard together.

484
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:28,980
I'm sure it's worth it

485
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,220
to remain here.

486
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:49,910
Yiming, my mother mailed these
preserved meat to you.

487
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,780
This is the fermented soybean
she made herself.

488
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,980
Our hometown specialties.

489
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,220
Daji, I told you already.

490
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,540
We're from the same hometown.

491
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,780
Don't be courteous with me.

492
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,670
But I have to this time.

493
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,350
After all, it's for him.

494
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,500
We still need to maintain courtesy.

495
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,020
Zhou, you're charming indeed.

496
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:06,390
How can you make Daji

497
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,150
help you so wholeheartedly

498
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,950
while posing her favor as yours?

499
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:11,590
That's not it.

500
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,700
Yiming, I'm just giving
talented man a chance.

501
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,780
Come. Sit with Yiming.

502
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,800
You don't know him well.

503
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,830
He's very talented.

504
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:19,500
Sit down.

505
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,110
He's much more capable than me.

506
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:21,830
Hurry.

507
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,540
Introduce yourself to Yiming.

508
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,910
This is my resume.

509
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,500
These are the scripts I wrote

510
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,670
- in school.
- Zhou Shui.

511
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,180
What does your family do for a living?

512
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,740
Does what they do for a living

513
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,460
have something to do with my job?

514
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,870
Of course.

515
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,190
Are you rich?

516
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,110
Can your family sponsor

517
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:42,980
the program team

518
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,300
or endorse the show?

519
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:45,980
I don't think so.

520
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,870
My family operates a hotpot shop.

521
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,430
Daji, I told you already.

522
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,390
The entry barrier
for this job is very high.

523
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,390
He's not eligible.

524
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:56,950
But wait...

525
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:58,260
Yiming, it's like this.

526
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:58,950
I...

527
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:00,950
I studied film.

528
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,260
I think I can basically grasp the tasks

529
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,020
of the program team

530
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,980
if you give me a month.

531
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,260
This has nothing to do
with your grasp of the task.

532
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,850
Your identity is what matters.

533
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,460
Are you looking down
on the TV industry

534
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,870
just because you studied film?

535
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,540
- That's not it.
- He...

536
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,900
From which school?

537
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,350
Is it the Central Academy of Drama?

538
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,430
I...

539
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,780
I'm from Haiko University's
School of Film and Television.

540
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,500
Is that school even real?

541
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,430
- Why have I not heard of it?
- Yiming.

542
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,540
I'm from the same university.

543
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,700
We're alumni.

544
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,150
Although our university isn't famous,

545
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:33,220
I made some works
during my university days.

546
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,630
I've burned them onto CDs.

547
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,220
I know someone like that.

548
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,870
He does the same thing

549
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,300
and keeps sending them to our group.

550
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,260
He did that for over a decade, you know?

551
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,300
Now, he's just an unemployed old man.

552
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,630
Guess what happened?

553
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,540
They filled a cardboard box
with his works

554
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,830
and sold it to a junk collector.

555
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,630
Therefore, these are

556
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,110
useless.

557
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,060
Yang,

558
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:59,910
in my opinion,

559
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:00,910
if there's a chance

560
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,300
for me to show my works

561
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,590
to your superiors,

562
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,630
I think they'll be acknowledged.

563
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,350
Do you think my superiors
have nothing to do?

564
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,060
They're very busy.

565
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,300
They got no time for your trash.

566
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,060
Understood?

567
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:13,950
What gives you the right

568
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,300
to say that it's trash?

569
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:17,830
Zhou Shui.

570
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,190
Zhou, you're inept,

571
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,980
but you have quite the temper,

572
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,740
huh?

573
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,630
You'll talk to my superiors

574
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,060
in the same way if you join us?

575
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,430
That's not it.

576
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,830
Do you think everyone

577
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,190
is as nice as me?

578
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,980
Yiming,

579
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,350
he didn't mean to do that.

580
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,060
(Resume)
Listen.

581
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,390
Right now,

582
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:42,830
he has

583
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,390
no capability,

584
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:45,500
and he didn't graduated

585
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,260
from a good school.

586
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,700
I can't help you.

587
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,780
Or, maybe I'll offend them instead.

588
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,460
Got it?

589
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,870
Daji,

590
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,430
do you think

591
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,950
it's easy to get a job in Beijing
just like our hometown?

592
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,110
Do you know how many people

593
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,350
are doing everything they can
just to remain here?

594
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,390
You're too naive.

595
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,950
That's why we came here

596
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,950
to seek your help.

597
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,980
Yiming, you know me well.

598
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,110
I never begged anyone since young.

599
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,110
But today,

600
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,830
I'm begging you.

601
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,060
Can you

602
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,700
do us this favor

603
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,460
on account of my mother?

604
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,060
Just get him a job.

605
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,910
In the future, We'll do whatever

606
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,260
you ask us to.

607
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,630
Okay?

608
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,060
All right.

609
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,740
After all, I see you as my sister.

610
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,430
Well,

611
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,430
though it's difficult,

612
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,390
it's not impossible.

613
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,670
As long as you can get him a job.

614
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,060
Alright.

615
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,700
Thank you, Yiming.

616
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,300
Thank you, Yiming...

617
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,230
I mean, thank you, Yang.

618
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:47,870
So...

619
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,870
Yiming, your cup is empty.

620
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:50,740
I'll pour you some.

621
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,350
It's okay.

622
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,430
- Just rest.
- It's fine.

623
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,230
My hometown friends.

624
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,220
It's all right.

625
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,020
My goodness.

626
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,700
Look at how good she is.

627
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,390
She has such great dedication.

628
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,220
You have to treat her with gratitude.

629
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,500
Did you hear me?

630
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,300
Yiming, I...

631
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,430
Let me keep all those things

632
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,460
in the refrigerator.

633
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,630
If not, they'll go bad.

634
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,390
Alright. Go ahead.

635
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:13,700
By the way,

636
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,700
come here.

637
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,390
Zhou, come.

638
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,110
Follow me.

639
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,190
Come here!

640
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,910
Natural sea cucumber.

641
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,910
Take it.

642
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,060
Natural bird's nest.

643
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,150
Abalone gift box.

644
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,220
I don't know what's this.

645
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:31,980
Take it.

646
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,190
Mooncakes from Quanjude.

647
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,020
This is good.

648
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,150
Wild mushrooms.

649
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,980
Take two bottles of liquor as well.

650
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:44,700
Be nice to her.

651
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,540
Don't let her suffer, you hear me?

652
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,780
Thank you, Yiming.

653
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,870
Many students have reported
your misconduct.

654
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,110
It has bad impact on school

655
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,780
The school is paying
a lot of attention to this issue.

656
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,670
Sir, I'll graduate in one year.

657
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,110
This has stirred up a commotion.

658
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,460
I can't help you out.

659
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,430
Forget about the scholarship.

660
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,780
The school will never permit it.

661
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,220
You better pay the school fees
as soon as possible.

662
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,350
If not, we'll have to expel you.

663
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,020
But if I...

664
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,020
Enough. Get out.

665
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,350
Go now.

666
00:29:38,469 --> 00:29:40,460
(Shen Jingshu, Resume)

667
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:44,980
Miss,

668
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,430
I'll be honest with you.

669
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:51,390
I have to pay my school fees
by the end of this month.

670
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,260
If not, I'll be expelled.

671
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,540
I lack another 5,000 yuan.

672
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,740
I heard from others

673
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,780
that you're generous
and I can get a job here.

674
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,700
Therefore, I came here to give it a try.

675
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,950
No problem. You have what it takes.

676
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,740
It's just a small sum.

677
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,740
Listen.

678
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,190
You'll be able to make that sum

679
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:10,700
in less than a month.

680
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,980
Eat up. Don't just sit there.

681
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,740
Really?

682
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,500
When can I start working?

683
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,150
I can start work tomorrow.

684
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:17,950
Am I the team leader? Or...

685
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,260
Let me ask you this.

686
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,740
Have you ever had a boyfriend?

687
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:25,740
I haven't.

688
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,060
Have you gone on blind dates?

689
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,020
What has this got to do with the job?

690
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,350
Listen.

691
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,830
You don't need to do anything.

692
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,910
This is an easy job for you.

693
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,460
Just have meals

694
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,460
and have tea with them.

695
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,350
You'll be able to make money by then.

696
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,390
Understood?

697
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,110
Sorry. I don't really understand.

698
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,830
To put it bluntly,
you're a shill of wedding.

699
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:15,060
Wait.

700
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,670
It's been a week. Why haven't we

701
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,830
received any news?

702
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,630
I don't think it worked out.

703
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,980
I knew your senior was unreliable.

704
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,350
Don't be so pessimistic.

705
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,670
I'm finding a job for you.

706
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:27,980
I'll ask him again in a few days.

707
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,390
You want to buy eggs?

708
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:34,830
Here's

709
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,300
your expense for the day.

710
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,190
I've asked my mother

711
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,630
to send us cured meat and duck.

712
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:41,350
Collect them

713
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,260
this afternoon.

714
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,190
I'll head to work now.

715
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,430
Take care.

716
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,150
Goodbye.

717
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,430
Jingshu, sorry about that.

718
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,540
It's fine. You can come in.

719
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,460
Come inside.

720
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,740
Did you buy a new dress?

721
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:23,110
No. This is my work uniform.

722
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,780
Help me zip my dress.

723
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,910
Just pull it up.

724
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,460
It's stuck.

725
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,700
It's fine. Just tug it

726
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,630
and pull it up again.

727
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:11,950
All done.

728
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:16,910
Thank you.

729
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,780
Jingshu.

730
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:27,910
What's wrong?

731
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,780
What kind of job are you doing now?

732
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:32,670
Just a normal job.

733
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,300
Then you have to dress up like this?

734
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,110
No choice. I have to.

735
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,630
Can you quit this job?

736
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:45,670
Why?

737
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,460
You look so good.

738
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,190
I'm afraid...

739
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,460
I'm afraid people might bully you.

740
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,670
I have to work to pay my school fees.

741
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,430
I'll only be bullied when I'm poor.

742
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:13,660
Thank you.

743
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:14,540
I'll be leaving now.

744
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,460
Mr. Wang.

745
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:29,830
This is Shen,

746
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,580
our member.

747
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,270
You see,

748
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,180
she likes older

749
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,060
and mature guys.

750
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:39,140
That reminded me of you.

751
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,430
Okay. Thank you.

752
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:42,750
What do you think

753
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,660
of each other?

754
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,620
Are you satisfied?

755
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,660
Yeah.

756
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,310
I'm very satisfied.

757
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,950
Shen, say something.

758
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,100
Are you satisfied with Mr. Wang?

759
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:01,950
Yes.

760
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,460
Alright.

761
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,980
You two can have a chat.

762
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,660
You go ahead.

763
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,500
Be proactive, okay?

764
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,390
Eat up.

765
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:16,270
Hello?

766
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,750
Yiming, it's me, Daji.

767
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,910
It's nothing in particular.

768
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,230
I just want to ask you
about my boyfriend's job.

769
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,460
My superiors have been busy lately.

770
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,460
They have no time for this.

771
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,870
When can we expect some news, then?

772
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,660
I have to make him prepare himself

773
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,660
after you make an appointment
with your superiors.

774
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,980
That's hard to say.

775
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:43,230
What about this?

776
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,430
Just wait for my news, okay?

777
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,390
Okay.

778
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,910
Yiming, you have to

779
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,060
help me out, okay?

780
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,620
Alright. Don't worry.

781
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,830
I'm already on it.

782
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,710
I'll buy you a meal next time.

783
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,270
Thank you, Yiming.

784
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,310
Goodbye.

785
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:02,980
Goodbye.

786
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,430
Are you done?

787
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,910
Alright. It's my turn.

788
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:08,270
Okay.

789
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,310
(I know well)

790
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,430
(why I didn't want Daji)

791
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,870
(to seek her senior's help.)

792
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,540
(It's because I had)

793
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,020
(a sense of uneasiness.)

794
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,580
Director Zhou.

795
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,500
Look at your girlfriend.

796
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,910
She has to work overtime every day.

797
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,430
You should show her some concern.

798
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,310
I'll be leaving.

799
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,980
(Or maybe,)

800
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,390
(my pride is acting up again.)

801
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:07,830
Alright. We've arrived.

802
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:08,540
We're here.

803
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:09,500
Hurry up!

804
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,180
Can you be faster?
My superiors are here.

805
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:13,750
Give me.

806
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:14,500
Sorry.

807
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,660
For some reason,

808
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,460
the bus

809
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,620
stopped halfway.

810
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,710
We had to change bus.

811
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,870
Can't you hire a cab?

812
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:22,910
Why did you bring your laptop?

813
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:23,720
It's his.

814
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,580
My works are on it.

815
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,660
Yeah. He wants to show them
to your superiors.

816
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,980
I think Zhou Shui
shouldn't enter the room.

817
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,790
Look how sweaty he is.

818
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,140
His hair and outfit are all messy.

819
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,790
He's not eloquent.

820
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,140
He might leave a bad impression.

821
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,870
But you're introducing the job to him.

822
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,270
How can he be absent?

823
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,060
You come with me.

824
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,350
Just speak on his behalf.

825
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:46,980
I...

826
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,230
Enough. Hurry.

827
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,230
Button your shirt.

828
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,620
Okay. Let's go.

829
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:56,230
This won't do.

830
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:57,910
I should be with you.

831
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,660
It's fine. I'll head in myself.

832
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,750
I'm indeed more eloquent than you.

833
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:03,460
And, if his superiors

834
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,390
dislike you,

835
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,580
you won't get a job,

836
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,020
you know?

837
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,580
Don't worry. I'm here.

838
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,060
Just go.

839
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,910
Wait for our news.

840
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:10,540
I'm going now.

841
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,310
Don't make them wait. Let's go.

842
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:31,430
Slowly.

843
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,020
Okay.

844
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:32,540
Over here.

845
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:33,710
Excuse me.

846
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,910
Please open your trunk.

847
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:36,980
Thank you.

848
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,230
Slowly.

849
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:42,660
Be careful.

850
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,020
Thank you, Yiming.

851
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:50,540
No problem.

852
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,390
Wait for my news.

853
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,350
Alright.

854
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:00,980
Daji!

855
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:02,660
What's wrong?

856
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,580
My god. Why did you drink so much?

857
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,270
Daji.

858
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,390
Want to throw up?

859
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,270
Here.

860
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:11,790
Director Zhou,

861
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,660
listen.

862
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:18,310
It's very easy for one
to lose control after drinking.

863
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,830
You should be careful.

864
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,540
Did they force you to drink?

865
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:27,710
No.

866
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:30,350
I drank of my own accord.

867
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,660
I had fun.

868
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,500
You have no idea. I...

869
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,180
I had a great chat with his superiors.

870
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,980
They even told me
their heartfelt thoughts.

871
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,230
I think this will definitely work out.

872
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,660
Daji,

873
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,870
don't drink for my sake again.

874
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:53,660
Zhou Shui,

875
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,020
listen.

876
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,180
From today onward,

877
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:01,270
no one can look down on you.

878
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:06,660
Don't my words count?

879
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,580
Do my words count?

880
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,180
They do.

881
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,750
You should get up first.

882
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,710
Daji, the floor is too cold.

883
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:14,870
Listen.

884
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,430
Because...

885
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,980
It's because I traveled back in time
from the future.

886
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,180
I'm serious.

887
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:23,230
I saw everything that happened.

888
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:27,100
In the future, you'll glow brightly.

889
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:28,620
Okay.

890
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:32,830
Be a good girl.

891
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:34,870
Let's head home,

892
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,270
okay?

893
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:38,020
Everything's fine.

894
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,870
Find a pot for me.

895
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:41,950
Give it to me.

896
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,270
You can throw up anywhere you like.

897
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,460
You can throw up on me.

898
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,750
Zhou Shui, don't shake me like this.

899
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,660
I'm sorry. You can throw up on me.

900
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,980
You'll feel better.

901
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,460
I'm the one doing the laundry here.
I won't do it.

902
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,460
Shicha Sea?

903
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,980
Shicha Sea!

904
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,750
Why are you so tiny?

905
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,580
You're not a sea!

906
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:11,870
In Beijing,

907
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,580
it's considered a sea.

908
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,950
If so, when can tiny shrimps like us

909
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,140
swim to the sea?

910
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,710
We're already in it.

911
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,100
Is that so?

912
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,500
Where?

913
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,910
Glasses, Vest,

914
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,060
lend me your PC.
I need to send an email.

915
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:24,540
No.

916
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,020
Shui, we're mining Bitcoin.

917
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,140
It cannot run anything.

918
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:28,710
You are still doing it?

919
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,540
Alright. You go on.

920
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:31,430
Okay.

921
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:12,270
What happened after this

922
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:13,390
was all due to

923
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:15,660
these computers.

924
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:18,540
At that moment, I had no idea

925
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,060
about the big joke

926
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,140
fate would crack with us.
