=Episode 11=

3
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,350
(Winter 2009, Beijing)

4
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,100
Hello? Anyone here?

5
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,900
How may I help?

6
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,430
Hello. Is Zhou Shui here?

7
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:00,900
Who?

8
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,460
Zhou Shui. My boyfriend.

9
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,350
I received a call

10
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,260
saying he was brought here.

11
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,790
The guy

12
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,630
who smashed someone's head
with a guitar?

13
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,310
What?

14
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,540
They have a serious grudge.

15
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,790
He beat the victim up to a pulp.

16
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,790
Who did he hit?

17
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,760
So you're not settling?

18
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,510
It's over there.

19
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,700
I'm not.

20
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,310
(At that time, I thought,)

21
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,750
(to get Zhou Shui out,)

22
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,660
(I had to plead with Yang Yiming.)

23
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,790
(But sooner or later,)

24
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,660
(I'd settle the score with him.)

25
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,260
Who started first?

26
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:44,980
Me.

27
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,030
How many times did you hit him?

28
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,350
I didn't count.

29
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,070
Why did you hit him?

30
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,310
He deserved it.

31
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,950
Answer me properly.
Why did you hit him?

32
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,840
(Interrogation Room)

33
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,580
Why did I hit him?

34
00:03:18,637 --> 00:03:20,260
What's the point of hitting him now?

35
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,910
What's the use?

36
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,070
That night, I should've...

37
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,910
What did you two do? Where is she?

38
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,100
Ask her yourself.
It wasn't me who started it.

39
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:46,910
In Beijing,

40
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,820
if you don't have money,

41
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,820
you can't keep a woman.

42
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,540
Why didn't I trust her?

43
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,480
(Interrogation Room)

44
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,430
You're Zhou Shui's girlfriend?

45
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,430
Yes. Is he done now?

46
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,340
Go home.

47
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,190
Don't wait around.

48
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,020
If it's not serious,

49
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,020
when can he leave?

50
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,190
I need to take him home.

51
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,460
Easy. He'll be out in a couple of days.

52
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,580
If that's the case,

53
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,870
why can't he come out now?

54
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,020
Is he in trouble?

55
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,630
He's here. What trouble will he be in?

56
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,070
He's not really a troublemaker.

57
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,990
We're just letting him cool off

58
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,020
and learn a lesson.

59
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,220
You need to cooperate, understood?

60
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,380
Sure, I will.

61
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,990
But I need to wait for him.

62
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,430
You live in
Chunzhili Residence, right?

63
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,380
That's pretty far.

64
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,820
I'm heading out.

65
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,780
I'll give you a ride.

66
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,140
Where are you from?

67
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,870
I'm from Ezhou, Hubei.

68
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,870
Ah, near Wuhan, right?

69
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,670
You know this city?

70
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,750
It's a pretty small place.

71
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,510
Small places are nice.

72
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,900
Less stress and fewer problems.

73
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,020
Why come all the way to Beijing?

74
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,070
What can I achieve
if I stay in my hometown?

75
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,630
What can you achieve?

76
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,460
If you stayed at home,
would you be dealing with this?

77
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,670
You're a young girl.
But you just wore slippers

78
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,820
and rushed to the police station
and slept there.

79
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,110
Your parents wouldn't let this happen,
would they?

80
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,070
No need to come here.

81
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,020
Go home, take a shower,
and get some rest.

82
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,110
Well, sorry.

83
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,430
Just one more thing.

84
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,220
When exactly can my boyfriend come home?

85
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,950
He's in detention now.

86
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,630
Detention?

87
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,700
Wait.

88
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,070
Why?

89
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,460
Didn't you say

90
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,780
it wasn't serious

91
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,630
and he would be out in a few days?

92
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,630
Where is he right now?

93
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,430
I can't tell you that.

94
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,070
Anyway, he's not
in the police station anymore.

95
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,870
Don't come back.

96
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,190
In the meantime,

97
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,260
focus on your own life.

98
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,780
Now you think of me

99
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,870
when this happened?

100
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,380
You said it yourself.

101
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,510
Last year,

102
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,340
we were late on rent for a week.

103
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,950
You stood right there and said,

104
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,110
"I'm warning you,

105
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,310
I know people everywhere.

106
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,950
I know all the big shots.

107
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,310
If you don't pay up,

108
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,140
I can put you in jail anytime."

109
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,070
So if you can put someone in,

110
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,340
you can get someone out, right?

111
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,380
Please help Zhou Shui.

112
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,460
Please get him out.

113
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,700
Right. Help him out.

114
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,510
We're all neighbors.

115
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,310
Right.

116
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,750
It's not that I don't want to help.

117
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,260
Well, how should I put it?

118
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,950
If only Zhou Shui had gotten
into trouble earlier.

119
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,870
Wait. What do you mean by "earlier"?

120
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,260
What are you talking about?

121
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,070
- No one wanted this…
- How could you…

122
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,950
I didn't mean that.

123
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,380
I didn't mean that. I just...

124
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,580
I'll be honest with you.

125
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,260
My aunt's husband got transferred
to Hebei last year.

126
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,550
My mother's brother retired last month.

127
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,900
And my brother

128
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,700
hasn't been in charge

129
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,510
after he got sick.

130
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,460
I can't do anything.

131
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,110
Scum, you're a liar.

132
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,870
You're all lies.

133
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,950
Nothing you said was true.

134
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,950
What did you say?

135
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,110
Don't try to fool us.

136
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,190
They all left in a month?

137
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,140
You're still lying?

138
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,110
I'm telling the truth.

139
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,220
You know no one.

140
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,380
And you threatened me?

141
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,380
You've been lying to us.

142
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,900
And you're still doing it now.

143
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,870
Liar.

144
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,190
What are you saying?

145
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:06,820
Keep it down.

146
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,780
Why are you barking?

147
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,950
What's your problem?

148
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,670
Shut up, Old Chives.

149
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,510
I can't do anything with it.

150
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,310
I...

151
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,340
Fine, I'll get him out.

152
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,190
That's no big deal.

153
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,820
Come with me tomorrow.
We'll take care of it.

154
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,780
Okay?

155
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,340
Okay.

156
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,100
We've got the gifts

157
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,700
and the money.

158
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,070
Let's go to the detention center.

159
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,500
Wait, still need a few more things.

160
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:36,790
Let me ask you.

161
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,460
Where is Zhou Shui's office?

162
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,500
We need to get
proof of employment.

163
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,190
He didn't go to an office.

164
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,310
He's an artist.

165
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,860
He doesn't work for a real company.

166
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,430
No real company?

167
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,190
No.

168
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,550
Do you know
what that means to the police?

169
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,460
He's jobless.

170
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,580
It'd be better
even if he were just a janitor.

171
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,910
- They won't release him.
- Wait.

172
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,740
Does that mean

173
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,700
I just need to get
the proof of employment?

174
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,950
Mr. Huang,

175
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,910
can you stamp

176
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,670
the proof of employment for me?

177
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,910
Didn't I already tell you?

178
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,910
We need to hold

179
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,500
a meeting to discuss it.

180
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:12,820
Wait.

181
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,310
It's trivial. You can approve it.

182
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,790
I really need it now.

183
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,550
You're only worried for yourself.

184
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,980
Have you considered the company?

185
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,240
And

186
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,670
we didn't know who your boyfriend is.

187
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,100
We can't issue him the proof blindly.

188
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,580
What if he commits a crime?

189
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,940
What would happen to the company?

190
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,340
That won't happen.

191
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,740
He would never do that.

192
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,190
You have my word.

193
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,190
Your word?

194
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,820
Yes.

195
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,220
You broke a mouse when you quit

196
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,390
and haven't paid for it.

197
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,340
Right?

198
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,030
I'll pay for it later.

199
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,910
Later?

200
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,910
You'd better do it now.

201
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,100
I don't trust you at all.

202
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,860
Give me a break, please.

203
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,150
Dai Daji,

204
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,700
why have you become like that?

205
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,700
You look so rough.

206
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,580
You should put on makeup.

207
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,620
I'm not working, why would I?

208
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,550
Look at you.

209
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,550
Don't tell anyone
you once worked with me.

210
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,460
Spare me the blushes.

211
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,630
I'm not telling everyone that.

212
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,270
Not a word.

213
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,100
Listen up.

214
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,070
I have nothing

215
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,190
to do with "Beautiful"

216
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,220
production team.

217
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,460
Not anymore!

218
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,310
I'll leave right now.

219
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,220
You're tough, huh?

220
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,460
Looks like you don't need this.

221
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,220
If so, I'll destroy it.

222
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,670
It has the company seal, you know?

223
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,550
No! Director Wen, it's my fault.

224
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,500
I need it!

225
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,980
Um... Thank you.

226
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:23,950
I need it.

227
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,740
I'm only doing this

228
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,670
because you always bought me coffee.

229
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,070
I'll buy you coffee

230
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,620
for next month, for a whole year.

231
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,390
No need for that.

232
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,860
I can buy my own coffee.

233
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,700
Just do better for yourself.

234
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,500
Did you hear me?

235
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,310
How was it?

236
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,460
My friend has connections.

237
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,460
Don't worry.

238
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,550
High blood pressure?
Coronary heart disease?

239
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,100
Isn't that too serious?

240
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,670
If it's not serious,
do you think they'll let him out?

241
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:02,790
True.

242
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,430
Give it to me.

243
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,790
Go to the small store in front.

244
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,100
Normally, the family waits there.

245
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,820
Okay.

246
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,460
Go on! It's cold outside.

247
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,030
I'm going.

248
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,910
Why are you yelling?

249
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,310
Hurry up.

250
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,550
(The 6th China-ASEAN
lasted for five days.)

251
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,820
Two yuan for instant noodles.

252
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,220
Free hot water.

253
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,910
(The scale of ASEAN countries
participating in)

254
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,950
(broke the record.)

255
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,620
Hey, this flavor is expired.

256
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,270
I come here every day.

257
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,070
I know exactly which ones
are good to eat

258
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,220
and which ones aren't.

259
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,580
Are you waiting for someone too?

260
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,860
My brother got into a fight

261
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,030
and was taken in.

262
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,790
Hello?

263
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:49,820
Hello?

264
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,030
Is this Daji?

265
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,150
I'm Zhou Shui's dad.

266
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,100
Mr. Zhou,

267
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,310
hi.

268
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,270
Yes?

269
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,500
I'd like to ask

270
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,670
if Zhou Shui is busy these days.

271
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,740
It's been a long time
since he called home.

272
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,100
His mom has been worried.

273
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,430
Zhou Shui...

274
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,820
His movie is about to start shooting.

275
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,190
He's really busy.

276
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,310
He'll call you back once he's done.

277
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,500
Really? That's great.

278
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,500
He dreamed of being a director
since he was a kid.

279
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,820
He always made his mom and me
act as his actors.

280
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,670
Sometimes a cop,

281
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,310
sometimes a bandit.

282
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,860
We even played foreigners before.

283
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,700
How are you? Are you doing okay?

284
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,150
I'm doing very well, Mr. Zhou.

285
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,620
Yes, of course.

286
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,220
We're doing pretty well.

287
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,150
We're just worried.

288
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,820
Zhou Shui

289
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,550
is a bit clueless.

290
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,910
He's lucky to have you in Beijing.

291
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,340
With you by his side,

292
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,670
we're more at ease.

293
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,030
Daji, if there's any trouble,

294
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,340
come back

295
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,310
to Sichuan.

296
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,100
We will look out for you.

297
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,550
Sure.

298
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,820
Daji.

299
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,150
Yes, please.

300
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:05,980
Thank you.

301
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,030
Thank you.

302
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,270
Making up lies is hard, right?

303
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,620
It sounds lame when I say it out.

304
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,100
I did the same thing at first.

305
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,860
After my brother went in,

306
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,190
I kept lying to my mom.

307
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,740
She still doesn't know to this day.

308
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:36,740
Whenever I felt upset,

309
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,550
I locked myself in my room and cried.

310
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,790
Maybe you should let it out.

311
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,980
It'll make you feel better.

312
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,550
I don't want to cry.

313
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,100
At least I won't cry for him.

314
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,340
How was it?

315
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,030
I got this.

316
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,670
He's under administrative detention now.

317
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,340
It's only a few days. Don't bother.

318
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,270
Pay this for me.

319
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:58,910
Okay.

320
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:59,460
How much?

321
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,220
Three yuan.

322
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,220
Wait.

323
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,860
You didn't help at all, did you?

324
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,270
What do you mean?

325
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,100
Your coin dropped.

326
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,860
How did I not help at all?

327
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,910
What did you help with?

328
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,310
I gathered information.

329
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,980
He'll be out soon.

330
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,890
If nothing goes wrong.

331
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,150
If nothing goes wrong? What if it does?

332
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,550
Make it clear.

333
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,430
Answer me.

334
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,270
Who did Zhou Shui hit?

335
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,220
Does it have anything to do with this?

336
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,340
Word on the street.

337
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,740
The person is having
their injuries assessed.

338
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,460
They might continue with the case.

339
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,910
If they decide to sue Zhou Shui,

340
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,310
it'll be serious trouble.

341
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,460
How serious?

342
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:45,820
He'll end up behind bars.

343
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:46,910
Behind bars?

344
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,220
Wait, he...

345
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,430
Uh...

346
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,500
Here's my suggestion.

347
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,430
You should go to

348
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,740
this person

349
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,550
and beg.

350
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,190
Apologize, and pay them some money.

351
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,070
Do whatever they want.

352
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,310
You need to settle this now.

353
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,150
Got it?

354
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,390
Gotcha.

355
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,390
Who?

356
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,220
Wait. Wait for me.

357
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,580
Let's carry on.

358
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,820
Keep going.

359
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,070
Why are you here?

360
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,790
What are you doing?

361
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,430
I need to talk to you.

362
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,860
She's my junior.
We need to discuss something.

363
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,620
You guys continue.

364
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,430
Okay.

365
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,820
Why did you come here like this?

366
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,950
Can't you talk on the phone?

367
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,430
Why do you have to come
to my house?

368
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,460
Can you leave Zhou Shui alone?

369
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,100
Don't sue him.

370
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,580
Why should I listen to you?

371
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,100
Look what he did to me.

372
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,390
I'm helping him.

373
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,220
He needs to learn his lesson.

374
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,100
Don't you just want an apology?

375
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,950
I'll apologize for him.

376
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,220
I'm sorry. Is that good enough?

377
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,270
He hit me.

378
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,620
What's this have to do with you?

379
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,340
What do you want?

380
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,220
Do you want money?

381
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,270
I'll give you everything I have.

382
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,500
Do I look like I need money?

383
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,030
I don't need your money.

384
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,740
It's not about money.

385
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,150
Then what do you want?

386
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,740
Zhou Shui wants to be a director.

387
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,460
He can't go to jail.

388
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,910
If he goes to jail,
his life will be ruined.

389
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,980
I'm begging you, please.

390
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,340
Can you not sue him?

391
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,820
Keep it down, okay?

392
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,270
That's enough.

393
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,310
Leave now. I don't have time for you.

394
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,310
Didn't you want to sleep with me?

395
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,030
Fine.

396
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,220
I'll sleep with you.

397
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,620
What are you talking about?

398
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,640
Didn't you want me

399
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,500
to be your girlfriend?

400
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,070
I'll tell them now

401
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,500
that I'm your girlfriend.

402
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,950
I'll sleep with you, is that okay?

403
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,910
Stop it.

404
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,950
I'll sleep with you right now.

405
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,390
And after that,

406
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,950
go free him, okay?

407
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,910
I'll give you back the 20,000 yuan.

408
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:12,300
Leave now.

409
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,500
It's not about the money.

410
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,300
What's it then?

411
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,830
Go with me to the police station now,

412
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,610
and tell them
you want to settle the issue.

413
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,870
Come on. Sleep with me now

414
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,780
- and go free him, okay?
- Stop.

415
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,430
Stop.

416
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,430
Sleep with me now.

417
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,150
Keep them on, okay?

418
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,590
Sleep with me right now.

419
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,670
- I'm begging you.
- Please.

420
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,840
- Please.
- I'll go now.

421
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,390
I'll go.

422
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,320
Are you settling or not?

423
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,910
Yes, I'm settling.

424
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,060
Do it now.

425
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,540
Right now, okay?

426
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,950
Here, take the money.

427
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,430
Take it back. The money.

428
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,980
Put your clothes on.

429
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,740
Let's go.

430
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,020
We're heading there now.

431
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,020
You go first.

432
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,190
You mean you want to
settle with Zhou Shui?

433
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,430
It was a misunderstanding.

434
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,020
Can he be released now?

435
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,870
Do you know the law?

436
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,870
Zhou Shui is in detention.

437
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,830
He'll only be out in ten days.

438
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,430
Go home and wait.

439
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,460
He'll be free after ten days?

440
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,630
Don't you trust the police?

441
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,910
Of course, she does.

442
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,670
So, the minor dispute is settled.

443
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,220
Thank you, sir.

444
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,060
Sorry for the trouble.

445
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,630
Goodbye.

446
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,300
Well.

447
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,830
If there's nothing else, I'll get going.

448
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,060
Get lost.

449
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,300
Is it

450
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:15,740
really worth it?

451
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,220
I have a daughter

452
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,740
about your age.

453
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,780
She got a boyfriend in college.

454
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,300
She actually gave up
her Beijing domicile

455
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,630
and job here

456
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,910
and went overseas with him
after graduation.

457
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,300
She struggled abroad for three years.

458
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,190
No permanent residence card.

459
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,590
No stable job.

460
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,590
She came back at the end of last year.

461
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,630
Her future is uncertain.

462
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,430
Does she regret it?

463
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,780
Of course, she does.

464
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,350
But what's the use now?

465
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,260
It's too late.

466
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,910
The best three years of her life
were wasted.

467
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,060
(Summer 2024, Beijing)

468
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,260
Um.

469
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,460
I hope I'm not catching you
at a bad time.

470
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,630
No. No.

471
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,150
I hope I'm not catching you
at a bad time.

472
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,630
Come in.

473
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,390
Okay.

474
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,630
Show me the mid-lane.

475
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,780
The group fight starts.

476
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,110
- Yes.
- So what you came up with is the game?

477
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,220
Yeah.

478
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:59,220
I told you I'd guide you

479
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,430
when we first met.

480
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,630
This is something we must do
before I leave.

481
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,780
But I said to stay with you today.

482
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,980
Don't you want to do anything else?

483
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,060
I haven't thought about it.

484
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,260
You're rookie here?

485
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,780
Not really.

486
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,910
Anyway, you're leaving tomorrow.

487
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,980
You have no burden to do anything.

488
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,830
So, tell me.

489
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,460
What are we

490
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,950
after that?

491
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,950
Situationship.

492
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:38,670
What's that?

493
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,740
A relationship with no relations.

494
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,350
No definition. No responsibility.
No future will be concerned.

495
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,780
But we can do everything

496
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,150
a couple does.

497
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,350
So that's what you mean?

498
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,740
Well, make up your mind.

499
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,590
Me?

500
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:04,950
Hurry up.

501
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,150
I... I decide... We...

502
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,060
Fine. Forget it.

503
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,260
Forget it?

504
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,460
Go to sleep after this round.

505
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,220
Sleep?

506
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,780
I meant you sleep on the couch
after this round.

507
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,190
Okay.

508
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,350
Walk over the fire,

509
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,500
and your life ahead will be smooth.

510
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,430
Walk on.

511
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,020
Good!

512
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,430
- Cleanse the bad luck. Start fresh.
- Cleanse the bad luck.

513
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,220
How was it, Shui?
Was it fun inside there?

514
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:47,780
Yeah.

515
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,670
Anything interesting?

516
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,150
Tell us.

517
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,260
Interesting stories?

518
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,020
Don't be silly.

519
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,980
Take off your clothes.

520
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,670
- Leave all the dirty clothes outside.
- Right.

521
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:57,110
Change into new ones.

522
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,220
Come.

523
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,460
Okay. Take them off.

524
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,020
Very well. Hand them over.

525
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,390
Go again.

526
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:05,830
From head to toe,
everything goes smoothly and safely.

527
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,300
Bad luck, go away.

528
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,390
Shave your mustache later.

529
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,500
It's getting scruffy.

530
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,190
Right.

531
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,390
I heard that Yang Yiming

532
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,630
was also taken in by the police.

533
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,430
- He deserves it.
- Your clothes.

534
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,190
- Put them on.
- Wear this.

535
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,190
It's done after this.

536
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,980
Today, I'll make dumplings
for you guys.

537
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,110
All meat.

538
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,190
Great!

539
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,460
All meat! That's good.

540
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,870
Dumplings!

541
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,150
All meat.

542
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,830
I'll give Old Chives a hand.

543
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,540
You just help by eating.

544
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,260
I'll wash my hands, Old Chives.

545
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,110
Should I use this to wrap?

546
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,150
What's wrong?

547
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,110
He's out now.

548
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,260
Why aren't you happy?

549
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,430
I'm not unhappy.

550
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,220
He didn't stay long,

551
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,500
but you've gone through a lot outside.

552
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,950
Just now,

553
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,500
I told him

554
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,350
everything you've done for him

555
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,700
before we came in.

556
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,060
You told him?

557
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,950
Why did you tell him that?

558
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,540
True love shows in hard times.

559
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,430
No matter how much of a scoundrel he is,

560
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,260
he would be moved

561
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,870
after knowing what you've done for him.

562
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,830
I'm sure he'll live a serious life
with you

563
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,630
in the future.

564
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,500
Perfect.

565
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,020
Pretty good.

566
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,070
What are you talking about?

567
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,020
Just chatting.

568
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,390
Your dumplings won't work.

569
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,500
They'll break.

570
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,870
Let me do it.

571
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,830
- Boil the water.
- No.

572
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,430
Old Chives, let me try again.

573
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,390
Let me try again.

574
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,220
Okay.

575
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,220
He got detained

576
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,590
because of me, to be honest.

577
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:07,110
He should've focused on making movies.

578
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,190
But instead,

579
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,220
he turned to shooting
wedding videos for money.

580
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,630
It's all for me.

581
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,260
As long as we're together,

582
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,800
he won't be able to focus on his dream.

583
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,630
Neither will I.

584
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,460
What do you mean?

585
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,350
He's already out now.

586
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,300
It won't leave any criminal record.

587
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,700
Everything is getting better now.

588
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,020
What are you saying?
You don't want to be with him anymore?

589
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,300
Do you know Magic Hour?

590
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,460
What's that?

591
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:55,950
Magic Hour is a film term.

592
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,390
It's the last hour

593
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,540
before sunset.

594
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,980
It's also when the light
is the most beautiful.

595
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,980
When the hour is over,

596
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,110
the light's gone,

597
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,110
and you can't film anymore.

598
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,430
Our love

599
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:36,950
is like

600
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:39,060
a long Magic Hour.

601
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:52,980
Beautiful,

602
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,110
but short.

603
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,540
Now the skylight's gone.

604
00:27:10,608 --> 00:27:11,950
We should end it

605
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,460
and wrap up.

606
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:18,870
Come back.

607
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,300
I don't care if you break up with him

608
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,220
or whatever.

609
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,870
Make sure you pay next month's rent.

610
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,110
You were having a hard time,
so I didn't bother you.

611
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,430
I'll pay three months' rent.

612
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,590
After that,

613
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,910
ask him.

614
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,540
Wait.

615
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,220
The dumplings are ready.

616
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,540
Are you hungry?

617
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,220
Well.

618
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,150
I'll leave it here.

619
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,630
Let me tell you about
what happened inside there.

620
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,950
It's quite interesting.

621
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,260
I can use them for my future movies.

622
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,430
You know, we couldn't choose

623
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,220
our own bed.

624
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,540
We couldn't sleep in any bed we wanted.

625
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,780
Because it had its own rules.

626
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,190
When I was inside,

627
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,740
many times, I thought... I thought...

628
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:02,910
Never mind.

629
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:03,780
Not important.

630
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,220
Oh, right.

631
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,540
I met a hacker.

632
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,670
He's really interesting.

633
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,780
He told me

634
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,950
that he created a hacker system

635
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,220
where he could take a little money

636
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,950
from someone else's savings account

637
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,630
to his own account without being noticed.

638
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,220
He made a lot of money this way.

639
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,670
He told me that if he got out,

640
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,540
he'd invest in my movies.

641
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,020
But I was thinking,

642
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,500
should I accept this money?

643
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,430
He's out.

644
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,110
I've done everything I could for him.

645
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,430
There's just one thing left.

646
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,150
You're up.

647
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,980
I'll go to the airport with you.

648
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,590
There's no need for that.

649
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,430
I'll go on my own.

650
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,300
All right. Make sure
you have everything.

651
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,590
Don't forget anything.

652
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,500
All right.

653
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,260
I'm off.

654
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:27,740
Why?

655
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,630
I'll leave this for you.

656
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,670
(Scandalous Couple)

657
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:47,670
What?

658
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,150
As a keepsake.

659
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,460
To remember who?

660
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,430
The Scandalous Couple?

661
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:56,700
Or you?

662
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,740
Anyone you want to remember.

663
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:03,950
No need.

664
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,950
Since we're parting ways,

665
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,140
let's do it gracefully.

666
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,750
No loose ends.

667
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:15,950
What about this?

668
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,140
Whatever.

669
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:20,750
I'll throw it away.

670
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,430
Bye-bye.

671
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,100
