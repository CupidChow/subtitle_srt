3
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,700
(Summer 2012, Beijing)

4
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,630
Hello, are you here to see Mr. Liao?

5
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,070
Yes.

6
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:55,740
This way.

7
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,100
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,950
Mr. Liao said
he's only meeting you alone.

9
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:02,660
No.

10
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,430
It's fine.

11
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,590
Wait for me outside.

12
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,020
Promise me

13
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,820
you won't lay a hand on him,
no matter what he says.

14
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,630
Don't worry.

15
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,790
I know what to do.

16
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,140
Wait for me.

17
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,420
Okay.

18
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,100
Please enter.

19
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,580
I can't give you the 100,000 yuan

20
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,820
for car repairs right now.

21
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,350
Give me a year.

22
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,700
One year later,
I'll pay you with interest.

23
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,960
Treat it as loaning me money
at a high interest rate for a year.

24
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,750
I've fixed the car.
You don't have to bother anymore.

25
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:45,700
What do you mean?

26
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,140
Sit.

27
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,030
I can afford this car.

28
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,580
Can I not afford to fix it?

29
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,080
Are you sure
I don't need to bother anymore?

30
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,750
It's over.

31
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,910
Sit.

32
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,700
Let's chat.

33
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,310
Where are you from?

34
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,420
A small place. Qinan.

35
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,910
Qinan old area?

36
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,630
That's one of the top ten
poorest counties in the country, right?

37
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,380
Yes.

38
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,950
My hometown
is also a small place and a poor county.

39
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,860
Look.
Don't you think we're destined to meet?

40
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,140
So to speak,

41
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,910
you're the same as I was
when I was young.

42
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,510
Your family is poor
and you can't stay there any longer.

43
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,700
So you took a gamble and ran to Beijing.

44
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,700
Right?

45
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,100
Who comes to Beijing
without wanting to make money?

46
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,640
How much money do you want to make?

47
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,750
I have no idea.

48
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,140
Let me put it this way.

49
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,700
You've been in Beijing for five years.

50
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,030
How much money do you want to make
in the next five years?

51
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,100
I have no idea.

52
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,820
Think about it. Think about a number.

53
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:58,860
Think big.

54
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,380
I can't.

55
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,030
Let me help you.

56
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,790
Here's 100,000 yuan.

57
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,100
If you hit someone's Maybach,

58
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,540
you'll get away with it.

59
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,510
Here's 200,000 yuan.

60
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,380
It's enough to buy my watch.

61
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,870
Don't underestimate this watch.

62
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,630
Wear it, and everyone will respect you.

63
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,950
Here's 300,000 yuan.

64
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,580
It's enough
to buy you a nice little car.

65
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,670
Don't ride
your crappy motorcycle anymore.

66
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,780
Here's 400,000 yuan.

67
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,340
If you go back to your hometown,

68
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,630
you can live a glorious life
for half your life.

69
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,630
Here's 500,000 yuan.

70
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,070
It's enough
for you to open a gym in Yanjiao.

71
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,960
What's the meaning of this?

72
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,380
Let's do business.

73
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,670
You can take

74
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,510
this 500,000 yuan.

75
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,950
Just tell Jingshu

76
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,950
you want to break up
and ask her to be with me.

77
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,070
This statement

78
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,870
will spare you

79
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,260
five years' effort.

80
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,310
Are you bullying me because I'm poor?

81
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,360
Are you bullying me
for never seeing money?

82
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,870
Let me tell you. I'm poor,

83
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,670
but I'm not desperate.

84
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,580
Who cares about your filthy money?

85
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,950
Let me tell you.

86
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,380
We're true love!

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,110
Do you understand true love?

88
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,340
I'll leave this money here.

89
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,510
If you think it through,
you can come back and get it anytime.

90
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,070
Who cares about your filthy money?

91
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,260
Let's go.

92
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,950
Did you see his expression?

93
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,950
Yes.

94
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,700
He looked stunned.

95
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,700
He thought he's all that for being rich.
How dare he tries to bribe me?

96
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,460
Yeah!

97
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,630
Get lost!

98
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,870
Watch out!

99
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,750
Jingshu.

100
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,460
I love you.

101
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:15,950
I love you too.

102
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,310
500,000 yuan.

103
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,460
You trampled it underfoot.

104
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,380
You resisted temptation

105
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,310
and withstood the test.

106
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,220
Why didn't you praise Jingshu?

107
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,020
Jingshu withstood the test.

108
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,430
That rich guy
has pursued her for a long time.

109
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,750
She didn't waver.

110
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,900
Here, a toast to you two.

111
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,800
A toast to you two.

112
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,380
- A toast to love.
- A toast to love.

113
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,220
Here.

114
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,630
If I wrote your story

115
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,460
into a movie script,

116
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,870
many people would want to watch it.

117
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,780
Two youths with nothing.

118
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,020
500,000 yuan, Dumbbell.

119
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,750
- 500,000 yuan.
- 500,000 yuan.

120
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,020
You trampled it underfoot.

121
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,900
You treat money like dirt.

122
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,460
What a great story.

123
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,340
The story is great,

124
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,870
but you can't curse them.

125
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,700
What do you mean they have nothing?

126
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,340
- Right?
- Zhou Shui is right.

127
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,460
We have nothing.

128
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,630
We have no money.

129
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,990
If I had money,

130
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,020
this won't happen.

131
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,580
Who says we have nothing?

132
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,870
I have you, and you have me.

133
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,340
And those things are over.

134
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,000
Here we go again.

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,820
We should look ahead.

136
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,600
- We want to be together forever.
- How boring.

137
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:11,840
Right?

138
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,340
Yes.

139
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,950
I envy them so much.

140
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,140
What do you mean?

141
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,550
I envy her boyfriend.

142
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,430
Look how reliable her boyfriend is.

143
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,510
I'm unreliable?

144
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,480
You're not very reliable.

145
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,040
If it were you,
you'll give a 50% discount

146
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,190
and sell me for 200,000 yuan.

147
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,870
You think so little of me.

148
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,760
How much will you sell?

149
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,960
Do you think I'm the type
to get taken advantage of?

150
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,560
- Really? What type are you then?
- How much will you sell her for?

151
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:34,820
30.

152
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,340
Do you have any self-respect?

153
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,780
Do you have any self-respect?

154
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,630
You're really...
I'll drag you to the market

155
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,320
and sell you
for four yuan per kilo.

156
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,720
Let me calculate. I weigh 70 kilograms.
280 yuan is alright.

157
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,600
You have to be deboned.

158
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,310
Here, let's toast to our worth.

159
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,110
- A toast to our worth.
- A toast to our worth.

160

(Swimming Training)
My resume and coaching certificate.

161
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,140
Can you give me a chance?

162
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,870
You worked at Tera Wellness before.

163
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,990
How many members
have you accumulated there?

164
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,140
How many can you bring over?

165
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,780
I worked there for only a few months.

166
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,750
Why?

167
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,820
Something happened at home,
so I had no choice.

168
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,430
If something happens at home again,

169
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,700
will you leave again?

170
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,510
No.

171
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,750
Nothing will happen again.

172
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,100
You have no education and no resources.

173
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,430
You can't even stick to a job.

174
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,390
Sorry, we can't hire you.

176
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,390
Mr. Li, we'll pay attention

177
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,670
to your company's commercial.

178
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,340

This project

181
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,310
is also our company's key project, okay?

182
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,270
Don't worry.

183

00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:18,980
Zhaoyang.

186
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,460
Hello, Mr. Li.

187
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,950
I'm Director Zhou Shui.

188
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,560
- Hello.
- Zhaoyang said you were coming.

189
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,860
I made a commercial proposal.

190
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,620
Take a look.

191
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,240
If you have any questions, let me know.
I can amend it at any time.

192
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,100
Not bad.

193
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,220
The proposal is pretty good.

194
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,790
You value me very much, Mr. Zhaoyang.

195
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,790
How sincere. Look.

196
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,980
We have to show some sincerity, right?

197
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,700
Mr. Li.

198
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,100
I would like to take this opportunity
to introduce you

199
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,340
to our talented Director Zhou Shui.

200
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,270
He's capable and tasteful.

201
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,860
You'll have nothing to worry
if you hand this commercial to him.

202
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,030
Okay, you're young and promising.

203
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,430
Thank you. I will try my best.

204
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,860
Okay?

205
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:00,920
Don't worry.

206
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,320
I will complete this commercial
with high quality and on time.

207
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,100
I'll make sure you're satisfied.
Rest assured.

208
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,820
I'm very satisfied with this proposal.

209
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,500
Not bad, Zhou Shui.
You leveraged your strengths this time.

210
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,100
You have to trust Mr. Li.

211
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,910
I think everyone

212
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,550
- can't be wrong about your taste.
- Here.

213
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:14,820
Okay.

214
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,840
I'm counting on you.

215
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,550
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

216
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,550
Right here. Goodbye.

217
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:17,860
Okay.

218
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,270
Bye.

219
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:18,910
Okay.

220
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,500
Not bad.

221
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,670
Zhaoyang.

222
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,640
My poor work attitude before
caused you trouble.

223
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,950
I also have to reflect on myself.

224
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,100
I admit that I've been careless
in handling some matters recently.

225
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,950
I hope you don't mind.

226
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,190
Anyway,

227
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,220
I'll rely on you to support me.

228
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,120
You respect me.
How could I let you suffer?

229
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,910
The budget for this commercial
is 100,000 yuan.

230
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,740
Make good use of it.

231
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,120
You can have what's left of the budget
as your bonus.

232
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,620
Don't tell anyone else.

233
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,150
Time to get off work!

234
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,950
The sun is great today.

235
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,860
You're acting weird.

236
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,520
- What's the matter?
- Why are you

237
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,700
so positive and motivated today?

238
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,910
You're so shameless.

239
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,500
Shameless?

240
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:29,980
How shameless.

241
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,120
How can we make money
without being shameless?

242
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:34,980
Zhaoyang said

243
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,680
the budget for this project
is 100,000 yuan.

244
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,910
Excluding all costs,
there are 8,000 or 9,000 yuan left.

245
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,430
It's all ours.

246
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,500
8,000 or 9,000 yuan?

247
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:42,860
That's a lot.

248
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,100
But when have you ever calculated money?

249
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,620
Did something trigger you?

250
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,620
No.

251
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,980
I think I figured it out.

252
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,220
I promised your mom

253
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,670
to make money, move to Beijing,

254
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,550
live in a better house,
drive a better car,

255
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,910
and give you a better life.

256
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,670
So I can't be

257
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,150
so willful anymore.

258
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,820
But I still think

259
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,460
you're cuter when you're willful.

260
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,030
Am I not cute now?

261
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,910
You're cute. Very cute.

262
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:18,340
But it's a puppy-like cuteness.

263
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,220
It doesn't sound good.

264
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,550
It's not.

265
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,310
Why is the sun so good today?

266
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,950
Why do I feel so relaxed?

267
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,460
I guess it's because I've grown up.

268
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,820
Where's my computer?

269
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,860
I didn't take the computer.

270
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,980
Your previous budget of 300,000 yuan

271
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,150
isn't feasible.

272
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,550
300,000 yuan?

273
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,950
When have I, Lai Zhaoyang,
shoot a small project worth 300,000 yuan?

274
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,150
Look, the script
was written by our creative director,

275
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,500
Director Zhou Shui.

276
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,070
We're a movie-level team.

277
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,910
It's impossible.
300,000 yuan is too little.

278
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,580
Our company has never filmed

279
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,070
videos under 500,000 yuan.

280
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:58,910
Really.

281
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,500
500,000 yuan is already the minimum.

282
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,820
We're not making any profit.

283
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,680
- We want long-term cooperation.
- 500,000 yuan?

284
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,640
He got 500,000 yuan
but only gave us 100,000 yuan.

285
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,910
Could previous films with budgets
of 20,000 or 30,000 yuan

286
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,030
were given 200,000 or 300,000 yuan
by the clients?

287
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,950
- How unscrupulous.
- Turns out we're valuable.

288
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,430
We're valuable?

289
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,270
I have an idea.

290
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,950
A bold idea.

291
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,950
How bold is it?

292
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,030
We should quit our jobs

293
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,310
and start our own business.

294
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,950
Would it be a bit too bold to quit?

295
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,820
I know

296
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,950
we said before
that we won't quit easily.

297
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,390
But if we keep work for him,

298
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,220
we'll only be able
to take his leftovers.

299
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,670
We need to become stronger

300
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,190
and start our own company.

301
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,670
Only then can we truly become stronger

302
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,030
and live a better life.

303
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,790
What do you think? Daji.

304
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,860
This is what I think.

305
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,910
The most important thing
in a relationship is loyalty.

306
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,150
If you decide to leave,

307
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,790
I will go with you.

308
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,100
We don't lack manpower here.
Check out other places.

309
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,700
How did it go?

310
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,270
No, it's already the fifth one.

311
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,220
It's okay. The sixth one will do.

312
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,980
We can only say
that they have no taste and vision.

313
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:35,950
Right?

314
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,880
What would you like to eat tonight?

315
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,950
How much money do we have left?

316
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,150
We have a bit left. What's wrong?

317
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,390
The rent is due next month.

318
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,620
Is it enough?

319
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,980
500,000 yuan.

320
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,740
I can earn 50 yuan per class at the gym.

321
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,190
Make 500,000 yuan.

322
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,430
500,000 divided by 50

323
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:04,980
is 10,000.

324
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,740
I have to teach 10,000 classes.

325
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,980
What are you counting?

326
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,740
Nothing.

327
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,440
Are you still thinking
about the 500,000 yuan?

328
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,620
No.

329
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,740
I heard everything.

330
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,220
I'll stop thinking about it.

331
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,700
It's okay.

332
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,430
Tell me.

333
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:39,980
Let's talk about it.

334
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,760
You'll stop thinking about it
after we talk it out.

335
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,430
I can earn 50 yuan

336
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,390
for each class I teach at the gym.

337
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,910
To earn 500,000 yuan,

338
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,270
I have to teach 10,000 classes.

339
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,500
At our car dealership,

340
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,310
the highest commission
we can earn is 1,000 yuan.

341
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,500
500,000 yuan

342
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,030
is 500 cars.

343
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,390
500 cars?

344
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,460
What would that be like?

345
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,030
I don't know.

346
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,070
Do you know what 500,000 yuan can do?

347
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,220
What can it do?

348
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,670
We can buy a house in Yanjiao.

349
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,070
In our hometown,

350
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,100
we can buy two houses with 500,000 yuan.

351
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,270
If only we have that 500,000 yuan...

352
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:36,950
Seriously.

353
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,500
Do you want that 500,000 yuan?

354
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:50,910
What...

355
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,760
What are you thinking?

356
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,740
Dumbbell, what are you doing?
Stop slapping yourself.

357
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,600
What are you thinking?

358
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,080
Stop. What are you doing?

359
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,070
I don't want it, Jingshu.

360
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,500
Sorry, Jingshu.

361
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,310
Sorry, Jingshu.

362
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:02,980
I'm sorry.

363
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,460
I won't abandon you, Jingshu.
I really don't want the 500,000 yuan.

364
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,300
The 500,000 yuan
is nothing compared to you.

365
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,220
I know.

366
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,870
Buddy, a 500,000 yuan house in Yanjiao.

367
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:26,630
500,000 yuan.

368
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,830
Buddy, do you want to buy a house?

369
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,220
500,000 yuan.

370
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,500
If you have 500,000 yuan,
you can buy a house.

371
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,780
If you have 500,000 yuan,
you can buy a house.

Mr. Liang.

392

You're back.

393
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,060
Here's the thing.

394
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,920
Mr. Liao

395
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,670
has been waiting for you
in there these days.

396

He asked us to invite you inside for tea

397
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,670
if we see you come back.

398
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,540
I know you'll come back sooner or later.

399
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,670
Let's discuss it again.

400
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,350
What are you doing?

401
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,740
I said I don't want it.

402
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,540
Don't worry.

403
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,190
It's not over yet.

404
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,350
This is what I promised you.

405
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,870
These.

406
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,780
These too.

407
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,670
And these

408
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,670
are all for you.

409
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,110
I'm really impressed with you.

410
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,780
When I was your age...

411
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,390
Don't even mention 500,000 yuan.

412
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,500
Give me 10,000 yuan,

413
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,910
and I'll do anything for you.

414
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,700
I can't compare to you.

415
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,350
You risk everything for love.

416
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,700
But what about a few years later?

417
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,590
If you still have nothing,

418
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,540
will she still be willing
to risk everything for you?

419
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,060
I know this is vulgar
and isn't good enough for you.

420
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,110
But I don't want you

421
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,020
to have nothing.

422
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,020
We came from poor backgrounds.

423
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,700
I know very well

424
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,830
what you're thinking.

425
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,220
Once poor people like us

426
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,460
have seen money,

427
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,670
can we go back to the way we were?

428
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,190
I'm sure you felt it deeply

429
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,630
in the past few days.

430
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,740
Since you entered the teahouse,

431
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:11,670
you and she will break up
sooner or later.

432
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,190
I can't bear to see you

433

sacrifice your future

434
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,430
for a hopeless relationship.

435
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,260
Do you want it?

00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,150

00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,430

Jingshu.

440
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,110
It's me.

that I have something to tell you too.

447
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,240
It's my treat. Let's talk while we eat.

Are you tired today?
When will you be back?

451
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,910
I need to talk to Zhaoyang
about something.

452
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:34,680
I'll be back later.

453
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,040
You're not going to talk
about resigning today, are you?

454
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,980
Why didn't you wait for me?

455
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,350
It's okay. I can handle it myself.

456
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,220
Alright.

Okay. I'm hanging up. Bye.

459
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,460
Yes.

460
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,700
You two are really close.
You can't be apart for even a moment.

461

466
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,020
You came back pretty early today.

467

469

sent these things from back home.

470

There are eggs, chicken and so on.

471

You must be hungry.

475
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,740
Put down your bag.

476
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,670
Don't keep carrying it.

477
00:23:59,260 --> 00:23:59,830
Try it.

478
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,260
See how it tastes.

479
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:01,910
I specifically

480
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,590

482
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,430
Is it tender?

483
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,300
My uncle called me today.

484
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,800
He said that our hometown
has internet access now.

485
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:29,670
And he

486
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,910
wants to set up an internet cafe in town

487
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,300
with his friends back home.

488
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,150
He asked me
if I knew anyone who knew computers.

489
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,910
I thought about
when we were in Chunzhili Residence,

490
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,220
didn't Glasses and Vest know computers?

491
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,630
They mine Bitcoins every day.

492
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,220
I called them.

493
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:47,060
They said they're doing well now.

494
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,110
These two guys.

495
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,670
Eat.

496
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,190
What did you do today?

497
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,540
Work.

498
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,540
I ran into Liao Jicai again today.

499
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,700
How did you run into Liao Jicai?

500
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,060
Didn't I go to work?

501
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,910
I passed by his teahouse.

502
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,110
He dragged me upstairs
and told me some things.

503
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,300
This guy

504
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,260
raised the money to one million yuan.

505
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:23,500
I said

506
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,150
what one million yuan?

507
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,830
I told him no way.

508
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,110
He wants to buy our love

509
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,590
with one million yuan.

510
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,020
This darn old man is funny.

511
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,830
Yeah.

512
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,190
This old man...

513
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,540
I'm sorry, Dumbbell.

514
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,060
I'm sorry.

515
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,190
It's my fault.

516
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,150
I was thinking on the way back.

517
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,020
I was thinking

518
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,020
if Liao Jicai

519
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,590
keeps pestering us two,

520
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,360
I'll work another job at night.

521
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,300
We'll definitely pay back
all the money we owe him.

522
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,670
No need, Jingshu. No need.

523
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,390
I have a solution.

524
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,220
What solution?

525
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,000
Let's just take the money.

526
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,160
If he shows no mercy,
don't blame us for being ruthless.

527
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,830
No matter what I do now,

528
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,220
the darn old man deserves it.

529
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,300
Don't you think so?

530
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,150
After we get paid,

531
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,150
go and tell him

532
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,910
that we broke up.

533
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,520
Then, we can secretly
go back to our hometown.

534
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,350
Didn't my uncle call me today

535
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,260
that there's internet now.

536
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,360
We can use this money

537
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,910
to open an internet cafe
in our hometown.

538
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,670
Let's do it with them.

539
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,460
Call Glasses and Vest over too.

540
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,020
They'll provide the skills,
and we'll provide the money.

541
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,400
What do you think?

542
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,240
If you don't want
to open an internet cafe,

543
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,190
we can go back to our hometown
and rent some land.

544
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,240
We can rent 1,000 mu of land
for 500,000 yuan.

545
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,350
Jingshu, think about it.

546
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:08,720
Are you kidding me?

547
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,440
How much land
could we get with one million yuan?

548
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,190
If you don't want
to go back to my hometown,

549
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,520
we can go back to your hometown.

550
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,430
What do you want to do in your hometown?

551
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,500
Open a clothing store?

552
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,760
Do you want to open a clothing store?

553
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,700
Let's open a huge clothing store.

554
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,300
Let's disappear.

555
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,220
We can even change our name

556
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,830
and never come to Beijing again.

557
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,300
Are you moved by what I said?

558
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,150
If you really
want that one million yuan,

559
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,430
just take it.

560
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,540
Okay.

561
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:01,190
Okay.

562
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,190
I want the one million yuan.

563
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,060
That's your money.

564
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,630
It has nothing to do with me.

565
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,190
I won't go with you.

566
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,190
What do you mean?

567
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,740
Where else can you go
if you don't go with me?

568
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,190
I'm not going anywhere.

569
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,500
I never thought about leaving here.

570
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,980
The sunset is so beautiful today.

571
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,390
Here, Daji.

572
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,260
Zhaoyang.

573
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,150
You worked hard.

574
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,460
You worked hard.

575
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,060
I have something good to show you.

576
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,700
I just confirmed

577
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,740
the new office for our company.

578
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:14,670
Take a look.

579
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,460
Look. It's the building next door.

580
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,950
Thirty-third floor.
Look at the natural lighting.

581
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,980
We've got half the floor
all to ourselves.

582
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,670
Look out, and China World Trade Center
is right across us.

583
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,630
I've reserved a room for you.

584
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,590
When the time comes,

585
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,110
we'll put a nameplate on the door.

586
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,700
Planning Director.

587
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,350
What do you think?

588
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,460
Here.

589
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,300
Thank you, Zhaoyang.

590
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,700
Don't you have something to tell me?

591
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,670
Yes.

592
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,430
Go ahead. What is it?

593
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,870
Zhou Shui and I both know

594
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:02,260
you were the one
who brought us out of Shendu

595
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,460
and started a business with us.

596
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,910
You gave us so many opportunities.

597
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,870
You've been very kind to us.

598
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,350
We're really grateful.

599
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,950
But after careful consideration,

600
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,700
we decided...

601
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,880
What's the matter?
You don't want to work for me anymore?

602
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,220
You want to quit, right?

603
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,870
I'm sorry, Zhaoyang.

604
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,700
It's Zhou Shui's idea, right?

605
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,460
No.

606
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,870
We discussed it
and made the decision together.

607
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,430
Did you and Zhou Shui
get together in college?

608
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:34,910
Yes.

609
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,460
I can imagine it.

610
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,430
When you were in college,

611
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,590
people like Zhou Shui

612
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,950
have talent, good personality

613
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,830
and free-spirited.

614
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,190
Yes.

615
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:48,190
He's also a perfectionist.

616
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,670
If he's a little romantic,
many girls will fall for him.

617
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:51,300
Yes.

618
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,980
Especially to little girls.

619
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,590
He's still quite charming.

620
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,500
But

621
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,300
you're no longer a little girl.

622
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,110
Yes, I'm almost 30.

623
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:07,740
That's why

624
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,910
you should think more about
yourself when you're young.

625
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,780
Follow the right person,

626
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,870
and you're halfway to success.

627
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,350
Follow the wrong person,

628
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,020
you'll harm yourself.

629
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,590
Daji.

630
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:22,830
I noticed a long time ago.

631
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,220
You're capable

632
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,220
but more ambitious.

633
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,300
Follow me, I won't mistreat you.

634
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,060
I know.

635
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,460
You're only Planning Director for now.

636
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,670
Maybe the company
will be yours in the future.

637
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,190
Don't quit.

638
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,460
Stay.

639
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,700
If I stay, what about Zhou Shui?

640
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,350
I think you don't
fully understand what I said.

641
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:01,670
Daji.

642
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:03,980
What I just said

643
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,350
was only meant for you.

644
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,630
I don't know why either.

645
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,220
Whenever I see you,

646
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,430
I keep thinking of the girl
who strived with me in Beijing

647
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:16,150
but eventually separated.

648
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,670
I don't want to regret it again.

649
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,390
Can you help me make up
for my past regrets

650
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,260
and create

651
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,150
a different future with me?

652
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,350
What do you think?

653
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,220
You know what?

654
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,260
You mentioned Zhou Shui

655
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,700
and said so much.

656
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,540
But when Zhou Shui described you,

657
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,500
he hit the nail on the head
in just one sentence.

658
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:03,460
What did he say?

659
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,060
He said,

660
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,540
"Don't think he's a good person."

661
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,460
I'm officially informing you

662
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:20,100
that Zhou Shui and I are resigning.
We quit.

663
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,580
Do you really like him that much?

664
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,500
I don't just like him.

665
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,230
Because the most important thing

666
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,180
about being a girlfriend is loyalty.

667
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,390
Don't you always mention

668
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,180
the girl you lost?

669
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,750
I believe that girl

670
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,310
definitely didn't treat you like this
at the beginning.

671
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:48,500
Goodbye, Zhaoyang.

672
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,750
Eggs, spinach,

673
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,620
beef, chili, tomato.

674
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:07,620
Ambush!

675
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,360
What are you doing?

676
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,000
You scared me. Daji, what are you doing?

677
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,160
What did I do? I ambushed you.

678
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,660
I thought I was being robbed.

679
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,870
What can I rob from you?

680
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,350
My eggs.

681
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,870
What's so good about your eggs?

682
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,950
I bought five eggs

683
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,660
and beef.

684
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,540
I'm going to make beef fried eggs today.

685
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,140
Is this a good combination?

686
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,500
Is it not possible?

687
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,180
I don't think so.

688
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:25,910
Fine.

689
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,910
Stir-fry them together.

690
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:28,870
I'm just kidding.

691
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,980
How did it go? Are you done?

692
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,680
You're really good at judging people.

693
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,880
I should have listened to you
from the beginning.

694
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,100
What do you mean?

695
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:41,660
Nothing.

696
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,460
I love you.

697
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,060
You're very strange today.

698
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,060
I love you too.

699
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:51,800
Is lettuce okay?

700
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,240
- Sure.
- Stir-fry lettuce with garlic.

701
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,200
Stir-fry some vegetables.

702
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,240
Why are the lights not on?

703
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:57,540
Gosh.

704
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,750
Dumbbell.

705
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,270
What happened? Are you drunk?

706
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:05,460
I bought the quilt and pillow
when I moved in.

707
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,640
I don't need it anymore.
I'll leave them to you.

708
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,060
Jingshu.

709
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,950
Jingshu, what happened to you guys?

710
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,140
This bottle of bath gel is new.

711
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,500
The replacement
is in the cabinet under the sink.

712
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,080
Remember to replace it
once you finish it.

713
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:16,750
What's going on?

714
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,320
What's going on? Jingshu, what happened?

715
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,840
Electricity and internet fees
are due on the 10th of every month.

716
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,680
I've paid this month.

717
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,760
There are some winter clothes
in the closet.

718
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,800
I don't want them anymore.

719
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:26,390
No. Jingshu.

720
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:28,000
It's up to you
to sell or throw them away.

721
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,560
No, what are you doing? Are you leaving?

722
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,240
I'm leaving.

723
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,120
- Are you going back to your hometown?
- Jingshu.

724
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,710
Do you think I'm that useless?

725
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,390
No, you... No.

726
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,430
Did you two argue?

727
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:39,580
What's going on?

728
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,350
Dumbbell, Jingshu is leaving.

729
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:42,790
Hurry up.

730
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,350
Get up.

731
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,230
Go after her!

732
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,620
Are you a man?

733
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,870
Dumbbell, get up. Hurry.

734
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,750
Get up!

735
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,620
Jingshu, you...

736
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:52,870
Jingshu!

737
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:53,870
What's going on?

738
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:54,720
Get up. Are you a man?

739
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,240
No, Dumbbell.

740
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,520
- Go after her!
- What's going on?

741
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,040
Are you a man?

742
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,060
Don't touch me!

743
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,710
I'm not a man anymore!

744
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,500
I sold her for one million yuan.

745
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,540
Are you satisfied now?

746
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:11,500
Jingshu.

747
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,180
You lost your mind!

748
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,180
Jingshu!

749
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,830
- Shen Jingshu!
- Jingshu!

750
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,960
Are you really leaving with that person?
Can you have some self-respect?

751
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,100
Shen Jingshu.

752
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,430
You let a fitness coach
sold you for a million yuan.

753
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,390
You're incapable.

754
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,430
Sell him if you're capable.

755
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,390
Why are you leaving?

756
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,710
- Shen Jingshu!
- Shen Jingshu!

757
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,270
I dare you to take another step.

758
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:10,390
If you dare to get into the car, try it.

759
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:14,830
If you dare to get into the car,
we're no longer friends!

760
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,020
Don't contact me anymore!

761
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:24,660
Shen Jingshu!

762
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,060
Daji.

763
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,500
Let me tell you a secret.

764
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,830
My name isn't Shen Jingshu.

765
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,870
My name is Luo Guixi.

766
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,910
Shen Jingshu is someone else.

767
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,840
(1995, North of Shaanxi)
Hello everyone, my name is Shen Jingshu.

768
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,820
My name is taken from Classic of Poetry.

769
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:57,500
"I waited for a girl at the city corner.

770
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,910
Loving her but not seeing her.
I scratch my head and hesitate."

771
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,540
Shen Jingshu spoke very well.

772
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,020
Come on, next student.

773
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,060
Hello, everyone. My name is Luo Guixi.

774
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,580
My name was given by a fortune teller.

775
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,980
The fortune teller
said I would be rich...

776
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,620
Luo Guixi? How are you rich?

777
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,750
You should be called Luo Qiongxi.

778
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,960
(First Lesson of the New Semester)

779
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,430
Silence.

780
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,790
Silence!

781
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,060
Silence.

782
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:30,950
Silence!

783
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,580
(Exercise Book, Luo Guixi)

784
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:48,620
(Shen Jingshu)

785
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:05,620
No.

786
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:08,060
Jingshu.

787
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,660
I don't care if your name
is Luo Guixi or Shen Jingshu.

788
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,830
You should be true to yourself.

789
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,140
You will definitely
have a better choice.

790
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,500
A better choice?

791
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,580
Daji.

792
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:29,950
I never had a choice.

793
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,710
I just want to stay in Beijing.

794
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,230
But you're going to sell yourself now.

795
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,020
What's the point
of you staying in Beijing?

796
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,230
I know you want to stay in Beijing,

797
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,310
but there are many ways

798
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,580
to stay in Beijing, right?

799
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:50,390
Maybe we haven't worked hard enough.

800
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,830
Let's work harder.

801
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,270
Even if we push just a little harder,

802
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:54,790
maybe we...

803
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:55,270
Jingshu.

804
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:57,270
We can stay here by our own means,
right?

805
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,350
Let's work together.

806
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,980
We can make it in Beijing.

807
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:00,870
Do you believe that?

808
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,270
Jingshu.

809
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,060
Jingshu.

810
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:15,750
Jingshu.

811
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,180
(Dumbbell said before he left)

812
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,390
(that he loves Jingshu very much.)

813
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,100
(But many times)

814
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,390
(he couldn't figure her out,)

815
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,580
(just like how he
couldn't understand Beijing.)

816
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,540
(Until this one million yuan
ruined their love,)

817
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,910
(he still couldn't figure out Jingshu.)

818
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:01,910
(But this time)

819
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:05,020
