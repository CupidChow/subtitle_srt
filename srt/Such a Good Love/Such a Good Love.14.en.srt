3
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,630
(Summer 2024)

4
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,350
- Wait.
- Make way, thank you.

5
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,100
(Summer 2024, Beijing)

6
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,350
I'll help you with your bag.

7
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,460
Thank you.

8
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,900
Thank you.

9
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:01,660
Be careful.

10
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,820
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

11
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,540
It's okay.

12
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,460
Be careful.

13
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:05,950
Okay.

14
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,590
Excuse me.

15
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,950
Are you giving birth soon?

16
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:10,980
Next month.

17
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,380
Mr. Chen.

18
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,350
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,510
I had poor signal on the train.

20
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,140
I went to the court to confirm today.

21
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,230
Your husband's case
has come to a conclusion.

22
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,350
My husband...

23
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,630
The opposing lawyer
has submitted evidence.

24
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,810
It's already been accepted.

25
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,070
The second trial verdict
has also come out.

26
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,230
The final decision is...

27
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,190
It's okay, you can tell me.

28
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,950
I can take it.

29
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,260
It's a death penalty.

30
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:47,790
Hello?

31
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,660
Can you hear me?

32
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,660
Hello?

33
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,510
Are you listening?

34
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,230
I can hear you, Mr. Chen.

35
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,350
Well...

36
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,700
Can I trouble you with something?

37
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:02,470
Go ahead.

38
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,540
Can you let him

39
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,950
give our child a name?

40
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,700
Okay, I'll do it.

41
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,350
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

42
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,630
Miss.

43
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,070
Thank you.

44
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,350
I heard it.

45
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,790
Is there anything I can help you with?

46
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,980
If it's not too much trouble...

47
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,630
I can tell you my story.

48
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,100
Sure.

49
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,380
Just like that,

50
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,470
we've been in love
for more than ten years.

51
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,380
I always thought
we would be together forever.

52
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,380
I really want to watch

53
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,230
our child grow up with him.

54
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,820
If it weren't for this accident,

55
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,100
we will definitely be together forever.

56
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,310
Tell me.

57
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,310
My husband will come back, right?

58
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,990
Miss, what's wrong?

59
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,220
After listening to your story,

60
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,750
I felt really bad.

61
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,020
It felt like

62
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,670
this

63
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,340
happened to me.

64
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,950
Can you put yourself in my shoes?

65
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,630
Yes.

66
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,580
I felt like

67
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,340
I'm you

68
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,870
when you tell the story.

69
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,700
Why did you reject my script then?

70
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,750
Here's the thing, Yuan.

71
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,380
We submitted

72
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,020
this script to you three times.

73
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,260
It was rejected three times

74
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,430
because you didn't want
to play a pregnant woman.

75
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,110
But I don't think you're like that.

76
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,900
You're someone

77
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,550
who has high expectations for art.

78
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,460
Otherwise, you wouldn't have experienced

79
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,950
this old train so many times.

80
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,580
No offense.

81
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,340
I think

82
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,140
you can win an award with this.

83
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,190
Because you're capable of it.

84
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,380
You...

85
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,430
Miss, what's your name?

86
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,580
I forgot to introduce myself.

87
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,340
Huanteng Films' producer, Dai Daji.

88
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,700
I look forward to working with you,
Yuan.

89
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,140
Ms. Dai, your new assistant has arrived.

90
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:38,750
Meet her.

91
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,550
Over there.

92
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,580
If there are no issues,

93
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,140
we'll proceed with her onboarding.

94
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,780
Okay, thank you.

95
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,220
Hello.

96
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,750
What's your name?

97
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,780
Tong Leyi.

98
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,700
My name is Dai Daji.

99
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,140
Welcome to the company.

100
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,500
(Summer 2010, Beijing)

101
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,430
My name is Dai Daji.

102
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,460
My name is Zhou Shui.

103
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,580
In August 2010,

104
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,670
I returned to Beijing.

105
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,020
In August 2010,

106
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,870
I found the girl I had lost.

107
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,430
I don't know how long
I'll be able to hold on this time

108
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,780
or what the final outcome will be.

109
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,140
But this time we plan to start over,

110
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,110
burn the bridges,

111
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,460
and give it another try.

112
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,610
(Since the beginning of the year,)

113
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,750
(Beijing's rent has risen sharply.)

114
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:40,820
(To save money,)

115
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,110
(we moved)

116
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,070
(to somewhere further away this time.)

117
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,560
(Yanjiao.)

118
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,320
(Yanjiao)

119
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,020
(People who work in Beijing
call this place a sleeping city.)

120
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,380
(The rent in Yanjiao
is only one-third of that in the city.)

121
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,230
(It's even cheaper
than Chunzhili Residence.)

122
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,780
(In 2010,)

123
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,260
(the average house price in Yanjiao)

124
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,220
(is 7,400 yuan per square meter.)

125
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,870
(Many people who bought houses
in Yanjiao are expecting it)

126
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,340
(to be relocated to Beijing.)

127
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,550
(Chaobai River's bridge
is always packed with people.)

128
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,190
(People in the sleeping city
are struggling to survive.)

129
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,190
(Everyone is looking toward Beijing
with longing.)

130
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,670
(CCTV Tower was going
to be completed that year.)

131
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:26,110
(Yet we're getting
further and further away from it.)

132
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,110
Zhou Shui.

133
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,430
- You're done?
- Let's eat.

134
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:31,780
Here.

135
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,870
Let's eat.

136
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,460
Want some beer?

137
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,380
Sure.

138
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,550
Okay.

139
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,380
- Come on.
- Come on.

140
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,430
- Come on.
- We're gathered here for hot pot.

141
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,510
- Hebei welcomes us.
- Hebei welcomes us.

142
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,460
I finished drinking.

143
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,900
- Here.
- It's boiling.

144
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,230
Let me.

145
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,870
Let's eat.

146
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,140
It's almost done.

147
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,190
Almost.

148
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,460
Here, Jingshu.

149
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,900
Be careful, it's hot.

150
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,580
Here.

151
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:00,990
Take your time.

152
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,780
It's not hot, is it?

153
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,580
(Dumbbell is having adult education
at Sports University.)

154
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,260
(With a degree,)

155
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,340
(he can work as a personal trainer
at a gym.)

156
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,190
(Jingshu works in a store
selling imported cars.)

157
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,580
(The two of them live a happy life.)

158
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,110
(They're now)

159
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,460
(like us in the past.)

160
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,360
There's oil on your mouth.

161
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,550
(Every couple who broke up
and got back together)

162
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,910
(lied to themselves.)

163
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,670
(But I clearly felt)

164
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,500
(we're not the same as before.)

165
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,500
(We're doing poorly in love)

166
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,100
(but excelling in the workplace.)

167
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,070
(We were both successfully
accepted into Shendu Pictures.)

168
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,620
(A new chapter in life has begun.)

169
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,030
Producer of the Year?

170
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,670
What are you doing?

171
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,220
Sorry.

172
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,070
Well...

173
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,220
Zhou Shui.

174
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,190
Lin Ze.

175
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:22,950
You know him?

176
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:23,790
Yes.

177
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,270
You know each other.

178
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,220
Well...

179
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,760
He's the champion
of the script competition.

180
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,020
I met him in the subway before.

181
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,500
Shouldn't you call Mr. Lin?

182
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,390
Mr. Lin.

183
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,030
Is your movie coming out soon?

184
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,340
Since you're here,

185
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,860
I want to ask you a question.

186
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,150
Why do you think
Shendu Pictures needs you?

187
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,460
Because I think

188
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,460
I'm the future maestro of Chinese films.

192
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,190
How shameless.

193
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,580
No, I always said this.

194
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,310
Well...

195
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,390
Dream chasers need to be bolder.

196
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,430
I like your shamelessness

197

No.

207

Why are you here?

235
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,310
Didn't I...

236
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,190
Didn't I win back then?

237
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,340
I won five million yuan,

238
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,070
- but I waited for...
- Hey.

239
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:02,820
We're in meeting.

240
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,270
I'm sorry.

241

After three months,

242
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:04,980
I didn't get a cent.

243
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,550
It hasn't been easy for you either.

244
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,150
You know what?

245
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,700
My dream is to make
the funniest comedy in China.

246
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,270
I've always thought I was funny,

247
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,310
but the people around me don't think so.

248
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,150
It's okay, buddy.

249
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,910
Now that we're in Shendu,

251
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,270
we're one step closer to making movies.

252
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,740
Aren't we making web dramas?

253
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,150
- So what?
- So what?

254
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,070
We're in such a good company.

255
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,690
As long as you have film in your mind...

256
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,670
But I have a question.

257
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,430
Why are our lanyards blue?

258
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,950
Everyone's lanyard is black.

259
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,910
Me too.

260
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:34,700
You too?

261
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,670
Is it because
we're in the creative field?

262
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,070
We're better?

263
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,070
You're so optimistic.

264
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,430
Blue lanyards are for interns.

265
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,740
Black are for full-time ones.

266
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,980
This must be our company's cafeteria.

267

No way.

268
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,820
This is obviously
our company's garbage corner.

269
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,620
Sorry.

270
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,070

Give me the book. Hurry.

278

Yeah.

379
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,500
you guys

380
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,980
still remember to eat breakfast.

381
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,270
Submit the video in three days.

382
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,820
Good luck.

383
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,790
Remember to eat breakfast.

384
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,790
Good luck.

385
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,270
The one with frizzy hair.

386
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,460
I heard
he's our company's editing expert.

387
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,820
Let's recruit him.

388
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,620
Okay.

389
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,860
How are we recruiting him?

390
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,860
I heard that you're the best

391
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,150
video editor in our company.

392
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,670
You're exaggerating.

393
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,430
Buddy.

394
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,270
We've been observing you for a few days.

395
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,740
Why do you keep eating steamed buns?

396
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,190
Do you not communicate with others?

397
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,270
Are you short on money?

398
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,820
If you have any problems, tell us.

399
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,390
At least we can afford

400
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,340
grilled sausages.

401
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,430
You...

402
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,670
You're too kind.

403
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,790
Xiaomao, move over.

404
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,460
We're a team from now on.

405
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,150
Yeah.

406
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,860
We all think

407
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,310
you're a right fit

408
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,550
for Useless Corner.

409
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,430
Why should I join you?

410
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,790
Because we all

411
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,590
- have blue lanyards.
- Have blue lanyards.

412
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:23,910
Xiaomao.

413
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,700
Welcome, Xiaomao.

414
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,620
Welcome.

415
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,620
Is there anyone in the company
who can film?

416
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,310
Yes.

417
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,740
There's one guy.

418
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,310
He has such handsome bangs.

419
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,430
Action.

420
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,550
Go.

421
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,350
Zhou Shui from Guang'an, Sichuan.

422
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,430
Dai Daji from Ezhou, Hubei.

423
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,630
Lin Ze from Shunde, Guangdong.

424
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,220
Li Xiaomao from Bengbu, Anhui.

425
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:38,500
Xue Cheng

426
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,630
from Shijiazhuang, Hebei.

427
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,550
- Here.
- Good luck.

428
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:42,740
Welcome.

429
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,950
Welcome to Useless Corner.

430
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,740
Useless Corner's first film

431
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,870
begins production!

432
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,870
How much budget do we have left?

433
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,020
Grilled sausage cost two yuan each.

434
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,390
We have 40 yuan left.

435
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,910
How can we shoot
with such little money?

436
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,300
Yeah, we still need to find actors.

437
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,220
Who's to say otherwise?

438
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,670
How about

439
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,700
you handle casting the actors

440
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,540
for this?

441
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,500
Yes.

442
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,060
No.

443
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,020
No.

444
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,110
No, do you think actors do it for free?

445
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,460
Beautiful.

446
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,700
Use your connections

447
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,910
at Beautiful.

448
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,740
Find models.

449
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:28,670
Models.

450
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,460
Yes.

451
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,220
Models.

452
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,830
Find a model!

453
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,350
Model?

454
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,860
Beautiful?

455
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,730
It's a small budget.

456
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,500
We bought sausages.

457
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,620
It's lucky to get them here.

458
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,190
Be content.

459
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,020
Forget it.

460
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,630
I'll sponsor a little.

461
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,220
- Gosh, you're rich.
- Gosh, you're rich.

462
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,430
It's for the sake of art.

463
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,900
Photographers don't handle money.

464
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,910
No, well...

465
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,700
Screenwriters
don't handle money either.

466
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,390
I'm an editor.

467
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,110
Director.

468
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,980
Directors can never save money.

469
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,950
Are you saying

470
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,350
I should handle the money?

471
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,700
Our budget will be

472
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,630
in your hands.

473
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,700
- Daji.
- Daji.

474
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:28,950
Then,

475
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,460
I'm a producer.

476
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,430
I'm a producer.

477
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,500
I'm a producer!

478
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,350
Good luck.

479
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,060
Are you the producer?

480
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,780
Yes.

481
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,030
Let me make it clear first.

482
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,060
I charge 200 yuan a day.

483
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,060
Pay first, I'll act later.

484
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,390
- Let's just say...
- Meeting.

485
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,740
Shouldn't the producer

486
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,060
handle the bargaining?

487
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:54,670
Yes.

488
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:55,740
Me?

489
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,300
Go.

490
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,350
Go.

491
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,430
- I'll settle this.
- Go.

492
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,670
Beautiful lady.

493
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,950
Can you do it for 140 yuan?

494
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,300
60 yuan lesser. Give us a discount.

495
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,460
Miss.

496
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,700
Think about it.

497
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,390
What if

498
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,950
you make our film and become popular?

499
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,390
Will you regret

500
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,980
bargaining about this mere 60 yuan

501
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,780
today?

502
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,150
I won't get popular.

503
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:24,110
Can a potentially popular film
be unable to afford 200 yuan?

504
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,540
Do you think you can become famous?

505
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,300
You can't say that.

506
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,430
Well, I'd like to ask you a question.

507
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,430
How old are you?

508
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:32,950
60.

509
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:33,980
What's wrong?

510
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,220
You usually play some extra roles,
right?

511
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,670
At this age,

512
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,980
what else can I play if not extra roles?

513
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,300
Don't you want to be
the leading actress?

514
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,260
Yes, Madam.

515
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,950
Do you know that leading actresses

516
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,530
have to bring funding
to the production?

517
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,500
You don't have to pay.

518
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,020
We'll pay you 140 yuan.

519
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:51,910
What a good deal.

520
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,830
You won't be taken advantage of.

521
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,870
I also have a little dream.

522
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:00,350
I...

523
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,540
We also have dreams.

524
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,476
- Dreams.
- Dreams.

525
00:21:04,476 --> 00:21:05,130
Dreams.

526
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,300
- Dreams.
- Madam.

527
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,700
Dreams.

528
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,540
Be gentle, Madam. Be gentle.

529
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,630
As the sun sets,

530
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,020
the heartbroken soul goes

531
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,500
far away

532
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:37,150
to the ends of the earth.

533
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,670
(This is my first film as producer.)

534
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,220
(The total budget was only 140 yuan.)

535
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,880
(I could never have imagined
at that time)

536
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,980
(that this 140 yuan)

537
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,220
(turned out to be
the beginning of my career.)

538
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,500
Okay.

539
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,190
Cut! Okay.

540
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,060
Thank you, everyone.

541
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,830
Let's call it a day!

542
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,910
(Fish's Love)
Look.

543
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,500
Executive Producer, Dai Daji.

544
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,830
Producer, Dai Daji.

545
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:08,861
(Producer, Dai Daji)

546
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,300
This is also Producer Dai Daji.

547
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,390
How did she become a career woman?

548
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,910
Aren't we following a romance drama?

549
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,540
How did it turn into a mystery drama?

550
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,350
Yeah, I also find it strange.

551
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,460
I asked a lot of people these few days.

552
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,430
No one in the company has heard of

553
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,630
the name Zhou Shui.

554
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,590
Not to mention

555
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:27,980
a director named Zhou Shui.

556
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,150
The Scandalous Couple we watched
won't take place

557
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,630
in another timeline, will it?

558
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,590
Tong Leyi, what are you doing?

559
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,460
Ms. Dai, this is a private call.

560
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,260
Was that Dai Daji?

561
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,350
Are you a hopeless romantic?

562
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,870
No.

563
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,830
I gave you three tasks this morning.

564
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,630
Prepare for the afternoon
production meeting.

565
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,150
Confirm the time and place
for dinner with Mr. Huang and Mr. Wu.

566
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,830
And print out the revised script.

567
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,460
Two hours have passed.

568
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,740
I haven't received any feedback.

569
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,590
All I see is you

570
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,590
calling your boyfriend.

571
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,870
It's not my boyfriend.

572
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,060
I'm telling you, Tong Leyi.

573
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,190
Sweet talk over video call is lame.

574
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,870
You might as well quit

575
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,430
and focus on your relationship.

576
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,740
Why work?

577
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,190
Ms. Dai, do you just assume

578
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,540
a guy and a girl on a video call

579
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,500
must be a couple?

580
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,590
I think you're the one
who's a hopeless romantic.

581
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,590
You want to quit, do you?

582
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,980
- I...
- You can leave now.

583
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,500
No, that's not what I meant.

584
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:28,870
I've already finished

585
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,110
the tasks you've given me.

586
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,540
Do you have anything else for me?

587
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,910
Find me as soon as you finish your work.

588
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,870
Don't wait for me to find you.

589
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,220
She's gotten so fierce now.

590
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,950
Our film

591
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,980
is considered a success
as long as it gets over 10,000 hits.

592
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,540
How come there are only 3,000 hits
in two hours?

593
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,500
Is it lagging on your end?

594
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,460
It shows 100,000 here.

595
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:05,950
How much?

596
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,980
100,000.

597
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:08,980
100,000?

598
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,540
(Hits)
What?

599
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,150
Still rising.

600
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,260
Comments say it's bizarre.

601
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,350
Bizarre?

602
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,780
What does it mean?

603
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,260
Useless people.

604
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,590
Our video is a hit.

605
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,780
How unexpected.

606
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,190
We have such talents in the company.

607
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:27,516
You guys filmed this?

608
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,374
You guys filmed this?

609
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,910
Producer.

610
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,260
We did it.

611
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,150
We did it.

612
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,580
(We Became Popular)

613
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,060
Let's go.

614
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,190
I've been in Beijing for years.

615
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,080
It's the first time
I met like-minded friends.

616
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,670
Cheers to like-minded souls!

617
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,260
Let's go home after we finish drinking.

618
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,660
We have work early tomorrow morning.

619
00:24:58,870 --> 00:24:59,430
Daji is right.

620
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,760
We can gather together if we want.

621
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,300
How about I settle the bill first?

622
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,260
Waiter.

623
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,220
Waiter, bill please.

624
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,220
- I'll do it.
- Waiter.

625
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:05,460
No.

626
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,630
Why you?

627
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,460
I can pack some food back for my dad.

628
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,500
He's still at work.

629
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,870
- Still?
- He's still at work?

630
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:11,740
He's working overtime.

631
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,150
Where does your dad work?

632
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,020
He's also in Shendu.

633
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:14,870
What?

634
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,910
Our company is full of young people.

635
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,060
Uncle must be over 50 years old.

636
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,670
- Wait.
- Wait.

637
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:25,910
Aren't all the bosses older, right?

638
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,500
May I ask

639
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,350
which leader of our company
is your father?

640
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,150
The entrance.

641
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,630
The short stern-looking old man.

642
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,460
The company's
security guard and cleaner, Xue.

643
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,740
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

644
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:41,670
You scared me.

645
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,430
- I thought...
- Did you give me a chance?

646
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,500
I thought you were an heir.

647
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,350
Yes.

648
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:46,830
Xue Cheng.

649
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,870
I really envy you.

650
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,010
You have a family member
accompanying you in Beijing.

651
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:50,590
How nice.

652
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,390
Wait.

653
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,350
I have a family too.

654
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,670
My girlfriend is waiting for me
at the hotel.

655
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,870
You have a girlfriend?

656
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,670
I have a girlfriend too.

657
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,060
And she's coming to pick me up today.

658
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,910
One is like this,
and the other is like this.

659
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,260
Why do they have girlfriends?

660
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,350
Wait.

661
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,460
Ze.

662
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:07,460
That one.

663
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:07,950
Over here.

664
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:08,540
Huang.

665
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,870
My girlfriend is here.

666
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,060
Over here!

667
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,910
I'll take you to meet my new colleagues.

668
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,780
- Well.
- Slow down.

669
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,780
Everyone.

670
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,460
Hello.

671
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,540
Slow down.

672
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,980
This is my girlfriend, Huang.

673
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,740
Hello.

674
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,460
She works as a sales assistant

675
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,120
in the clothing store
next to our company.

676
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,590
Sorry, I'm late.

677
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,020
She's a bit afraid of the dark, so...

678
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,950
I'm not afraid.

679
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,030
You came to accompany Ze
as soon as you got off work.

680
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:33,700
True love.

681
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,020
- True love.
- True love.

682
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,460
Now it seems

683
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,980
that these two

684
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,300
are the most pitiful

685
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:40,740
in our group.

686
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,430
It's not easy
to make it alone in Beijing.

687
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,350
Alone?

688
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,190
I think you two should just make do

689
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:46,950
with each other.

690
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,460
Yes.

691
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,830
Strive and progress together!

692
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:49,980
What do you mean?

693
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,220
He's my boyfriend.

694
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,020
She's my girlfriend.

695
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,390
They're a couple?

696
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,260
We're very close.

697
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,390
We commute to work together.

698
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,060
We go to the company together every day.

699
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:58,940
Aren't you together

700
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,300
because you're going the same way?

701
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,730
You're just taking a ride together.

702
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,500
Then what do you think we are?

703
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,980
You're like...

704
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,540
- Buddies.
- Buddies.

705
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:17,590
Buddies?

706
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,540
Buddies.

707
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,150
I feel a little dizzy.

708
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,430
Zhou Shui.

709
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,300
Why don't we just be buddies?

710
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,630
What do you expect me to say?

711
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,460
Because our current relationship

712
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,830
is just awkward.

713
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,110
Being a couple

714
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,020
is just troublesome.

715
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,780
But being buddies has no burden.

716
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:52,780
Firstly,

717
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,910
we don't have to worry
about the conflicts we had.

718
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,190
Secondly,

719
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,460
we don't have to worry

720
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,460
about breaking up anymore, right?

721
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,460
Don't worry.

722
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:07,350
Daji is very loyal.

723
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,460
From now on,

724
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,700
I'll treat you like my younger brother.

725
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,220
Okay?

726
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:12,740
You know.

727
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,180
I wanted to have an older brother
when I was little.

728
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,910
Isn't that perfect?

729
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,670
You're my brother now.

730
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,020
Brother?

731
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:23,540
Watch out.

732
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,670
- Dumbbell.
- Dumbbell.

733
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,500
Dumbbell!

734
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,540
Dumbbell!

735
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,190
You're back.

736
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,540
Why are you here?

737
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,630
What are you doing?

738
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,700
You've grown bigger.

739
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:39,740
You're annoying.

740
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,910
You always pinch him.

741
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,630
What are you doing here?

742
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,670
I'm waiting for Jingshu.

743
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:44,500
Jingshu?

744
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,990
- Is she not back yet?
- It's 2 AM.

745
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,780
She works overtime.

746
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,010
Don't know when'll she be back.

747
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:48,740
That late?

748
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:52,830
That's Jingshu.

749
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,980
- Jingshu!
- Jingshu.

750
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,350
Perfect timing.

751
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,350
Bye.

752
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,220
Bye, see you tomorrow.

753
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,020
Why are you here?

754
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,950
We just got back too.

755
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,350
Dumbbell is waiting for you.

756
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,330
What are you looking at?

757
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,590
Who's that?

758
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,590
Colleague.

759
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,190
Which colleague?

760
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,430
Colleague at work.

761
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,830
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

762
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,700
- Let's go.
- Come.

763
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,040
- Let's go home.
- Let's go home.

764
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,260
Your workouts have been effective.

765
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,190
Did you train it today?

766
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,060
I'm alright.

767
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,260
You're like a bullfrog now.

768
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,630
Why did you agree to let him send you?

769
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:27,500
He's my colleague.

770
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,390
And we split the gas bill, okay?

771
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,430
It's still inappropriate.

772
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,730
It's inappropriate if it's a man.

773
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,430
He's married
and has a three-year-old kid.

774
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,910
How could he go after me?

775
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,890
He's married with a kid.

776
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,110
Yet he let you sit beside him.

777
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:38,910
What is he after?

778
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,540
You mean I have to sit in the back seat?

779
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,950
Won't I be treating him as a driver?

780
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,460
I don't care.

781
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,700
Even the trunk is forbidden.

782
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,670
Trunk?

783
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,190
You've indeed gone too far.

784
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,540
Dumbbell.

785
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,640
Let me tell you something.

786
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,910
Come.

787
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:54,980
Come on.

788
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,260
Look at you.

789
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,930
You'll say any trash when you're angry.

790
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,060
The trunk?

791
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,630
How hurtful.

792
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,950
It's normal to be jealous, right?

793
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,110
Men are like that.

794
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,460
You don't have to be so angry.

795
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,150
Look at Dumbbell.

796
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,910
How petty.

797
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,670
He's angry over such a small matter.

798
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,630
Yeah.

799
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:15,670
Even if he's worried,

800
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,430
what he said was really harsh.

801
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,740
It's like I'm having an affair

802
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,190
whenever I'm with another man.

803
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,870
Don't you know Dumbbell well?

804
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,530
His muscles are well-developed,

805
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,430
but his mind is...

806
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,150
Simple.

807
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:29,870
Yes.

808
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:30,870
Yes, I admit it.

809
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,540
I'm a simple-minded person

810
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,870
who speaks without thinking.

811
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,110
She had suffered so much before.

812
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,740
I can't let her get hurt any more.

813
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,980
I must protect her.

814
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:40,540
Sure.

815
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,390
Tell me how you'll protect her.

816
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,590
I've already thought about it.

817
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,110
I'll save up first.

818
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,350
When I have enough money,

819
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,430
I'll open a training studio.

820
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,700
I'll make money to support her.

821
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,500
When we save enough money,

822
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,390
he can open a private training studio.

823
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,060
Then, I can quit

824
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,540
the car dealership.

825
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:06,540
I can help him
keep the accounts and collect the money.

826
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,460
Then, we can get married.

827
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,780
And have a child.

828
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,780
Anyway, I'm taking care of her
the whole life.

829
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,730
I'm fine with anything.

830
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:15,220
I feel like

831
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,300
I could be with Dumbbell forever.

832
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,670
Gosh.

833
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,630
Didn't you just have an argument?

834
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,110
I didn't even need to comfort you.

835
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,780
You two are showing off.

836
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,870
You're upsetting me.

837
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,540
Alright.

838
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:27,910
I'll go now.

839
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,020
No, wait.

840
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,540
She's still angry.

841
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:31,950
Haven't you calmed down?

842
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,220
You've even imagined the future.

843
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,630
Having a child, buying a car.

844
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,540
Is this an argument?

845
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,740
You two are showing off.

846
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:39,780
Back in Chunzhili,

847
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,740
you and Daji showed off to us a lot too.

848
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:42,700
Did we?

849
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,390
Were we

850
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,350
as close as you are now?

851
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,220
Yes, you two are worse.

852
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,260
Really?

853
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:55,950
When I think about it,

854
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,260
I suddenly miss the past.

855
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,020
But that was the past.

856
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,060
I miss it so much.

857
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,390
What are you missing?

858
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,670
Haven't you two reconciled?

859
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,780
You know what?
On the way back just now,

860
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,950
I want him to be my brother.

861
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,020
He agreed.

862
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,910
Daji told me today

863
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,870
that we should just be buddies.

864
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,260
Although we're back together,

865
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,430
I keep feeling like

866
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,420
we can never go back
to how things were before.

867
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,740
If that feeling from before is gone,

868
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,700
what's left between us?

869
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:54,350
How can we maintain our relationship?

870
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:12,700
Is it time?

871
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,740
90 days, 8 hours, and 43 minutes.

872
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,590
It's time.

873
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,190
Okay.

874
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:24,500
- Buddy.
- Buddy.

875
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,390
Go!

876
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,500
Go in.

877
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,980
It's been three months.
Time to change them.

878
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,670
Our three-month internship is over.

879
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,190
Give us black lanyards.

880
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,790
- Black lanyards!
- Black lanyards!

881
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:48,500
Okay!

882
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,150
Congratulations.

883
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:51,980
Next,

884
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,060
you have six months of probation
waiting for you.

885
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,870
These are for your probation.

886
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,390
They're all

887
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:02,460
blue.

888
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,540
What's the difference?

889
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,150
Take a look.

890
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,100
This is royal blue.

891
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,350
This is navy blue.

892
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,230
It's obvious.

893
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,500
- Kind of obvious.
- It's obvious.

894
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,460
Get out!

895
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,230
Tell me.

896
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,020
What's the difference

897
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,010
between the blue in summer
and the blue in autumn?

898
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,750
The color is a little darker.

899
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,580
I'm leaving, Director Zhou.

900
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:40,500
Bye.

901
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,430
- See you.
- See you.

902
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:42,100
Bye.

903
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,230
You won't see me tomorrow.

904
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,310
I'm going to quit.

905
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,430
What?

906
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,020
Why are you quitting?

907
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,140
What do you mean?

908
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,350
Xiaomao.

909
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,540
I'm going back to get married.

910
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:56,660
Get married?

911
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,950
You're getting married young?

912
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,870
I've been working here for so long
but still haven't been made permanent.

913
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,980
My girlfriend's been waiting
for me for years.

914
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:06,950
She told me

915
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,830
to either get married

916
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,140
or break up.

917
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,790
I love her very much.

918
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,100
We already booked the tickets.

919
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,710
I can't make movies with you anymore.

920
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,750
No!

921
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,750
Where's your girlfriend?

922
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,580
Take us to her.

923
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,390
Dear, listen to me.

924
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,190
It's too early for you
to go to the airport.

925
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,180
Your flight is at 9 PM.

926
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,870
Wait for me, I'll be at the hotel soon.

927
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,710
Right away.

928
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:34,750
She has packed her luggage.

929
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:35,830
Mr. Li, welcome home.

930
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,460
No, you're staying here temporarily?

931
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,660
We have always stayed here.

932
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:43,020
You're staying at a five-star hotel.

933
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:43,360
Not bad.

934
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,790
It's good to have a staff to clean.

935
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,020
Then why do you keep eating

936
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,020
buns and instant noodles?

937
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,180
A lot of footage to edit.

938
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,220
I don't have time to eat.

939
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,310
Buddy, you're rich.

940
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,230
Why edit footage there?

941
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,060
That's not my money.

942
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,230
It's my dad's money!

943
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,200
Your dad's rich,
so you don't need to work hard!

944
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,100
Do you understand me or not?

945
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,460
If I don't work hard,

946
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,660
I have to go back

947
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,980
to inherit our family's dental clinic!

948
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:15,910
Mr. Li.

949
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,910
Welcome home.

950
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,060
Li Xiaomao.

951
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:21,580
Yan.

952
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,180
- Send it to Bengbu, Anhui.
- What?

953
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,350
I brought my colleagues to meet you.

954
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:32,750
- Hi.
- Hi.

955
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:33,430
I've met them.

956
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,180
Miss, please stay!

957
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,870
Can you let him stay here?

958
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,350
Yes.

959
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,180
Just break up.

960
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:39,950
No!

961
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,980
Well... Xiaomao came to Beijing

962
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,460
to make money to support you.

963
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,830
Don't talk nonsense!

964
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,460
She's richer than me.

965
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,580
Can you not get married first?

966
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,660
What do you think?

967
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,640
We've been dating for seven years.

968
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:05,329
I need to take on the responsibility
that I should bear.

969
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,610
Can you guys get engaged first?

970
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:10,170
We're already engaged!

971
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,150
Maybe I shouldn't have come to Beijing.

972
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:17,990
I'm too selfish.

973
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,920
Didn't you bring so many colleagues
to meet me

974
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,760
because you want me
to give you some face?

975
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:26,630
Okay.

976
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,240
I'll give you face.

977
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,630
I know

978
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,110
you want to stay in Beijing
to make movies.

979
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,150
Right?

980
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,590
Let's...

981
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:42,920
Break up.

982
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,470
- Okay!
- Okay!

983
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,550
Well...

984
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,630
Break up?

985
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,840
Listen well.

986
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,550
You look pretty handsome today.

987
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:16,960
Xiaomao.

988
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,190
Let me tell you a secret.

989
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,880
Didn't you say before

990
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,880
that Daji and I

991
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,990
don't look like a couple?

992
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,240
Indeed, we think so too.

993
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,880
Because Daji has broken up

994
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,800
with me half a year ago.

995
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,590
Break up?

996
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:48,070
She left me and Beijing half a year ago.

997
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:53,840
I think she couldn't hold on any longer
in the relationship.

998
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,240
But I can't let her go.

999
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,190
Just like how we can't let go of movies.

1000
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:04,110
Why was she willing
to come back with you?

1001
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:07,920
I don't know either.

1002
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,400
Yan!

1003
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,440
Miss Yan!

1004
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,800
Miss Yan!

1005
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,110
Yan!

1006
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,360
Miss Yan!

1007
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,470
Yan!

1008
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,150
Miss Yan!

1009
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,960
I know why you want to leave.

1010
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,440
I understand you

1011
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,630
because we're the same.

1012
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,190
How are we the same?

1013
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,360
We both fell in love
with a boy who loves movies.

1014
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,280
We broke up before.

1015
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:00,720
The reason
I was willing to come back with him

1016
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,550
is because he's different from others.

1017
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,360
He has a dream

1018
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,800
and loves movies.

1019
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,470
He shines!

1020
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,760
Miss Yan!

1021
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,760
The five of us

1022
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,360
became friends

1023
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,670
because we have a common dream.

1024
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,030
We're going to make movies in Beijing.

1025
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,280
Every one of us is indispensable.

1026
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:44,360
I can see that you're the same as us.

1027
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,760
Otherwise, you wouldn't have

1028
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,380
waited for him in Beijing
for four years.

1029
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,280
Li Xiaomao didn't let you down.

1030
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,550
We're very close to making movies.

1031
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,070
Li Xiaomao is a brave man.

1032
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,880
A man with dreams.

1033
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:58,110
People with dreams are worthy of love!

1034
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:02,630
People with dreams shine!

1035
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,030
- Stay here!
- Stay here!

1036
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:09,030
- Let's make movies together!
- Let's make movies together!

1037
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,360
Stop talking.

1038
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,920
Yan!

1039
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,760
I love you!

1040
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,320
Please don't leave!

1041
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,400
Why did she leave anyway?

1042
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,440
It's okay, Xiaomao.

1043
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,990
You tried your best, Xiaomao.

1044
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,990
What should I do?

1045
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,320
Xiaomao.

1046
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,240
(Impressing others with dreams)

1047
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,840
(sounds like a joke now.)

1048
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,840
(But many years later,)

1049
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,510
(the me who's been worn down by reality)

1050
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,240
(misses that shining era)

1051
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,470
(and those shining people even more.)

1052
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:30,920
We can make movies now.

1053
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,030
Let's make movies!

1054
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,320
Zhou Shui!

1055
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:36,550
I get it now.

1056
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,030
I came back to Beijing this time

1057
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,240
to help you make movies.

1058
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:46,510
I'm here to help you
realize your movie dream!

1059
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:48,510
Thank you, Daji!

1060
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,240
If you don't let me down,

1061
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:58,590
