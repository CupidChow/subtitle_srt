=Such A Good Love=

2
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,220
=Episode 25=

3
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,780
(Autumn 2018, Beijing)

4
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,590
(Autumn 2018, Beijing)
Director Zhou.

5
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,300
Here at Ruidi Pictures,

6
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,630
we hope to create new marvels with you.

7
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,540
Come on.

8
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,540
(Director Employment Agreement
for "The Guardian Project")

9
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,910
What is "The Guardian Project"?

10
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,860
This isn't what we agreed on, Ms. Chao.

11
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,420
The next should be "Such A Good Love".

12
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,510
I've made the movie

13
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,820
you wanted.

14
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,580
And it made money for the company.

15
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,630
So what about the promise
you made to me?

16
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,260
Director Zhou.

17
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,510
Come on, don't jump the gun.

18
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,790
Here, take a look.

19
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,540
Look here.

20
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,140
(Remuneration)
For this one, your pay will be

21
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,630
RMB three million,

22
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,230
plus box office bonuses.

23
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,910
That's a lot of money, right?

24
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,660
So?

25
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,190
So, just focus on finishing this movie.

26
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,260
Once you've made money,

27
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,950
you can use it to shoot the film
you want to make.

28
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,380
Think about a billion at the box office.

29
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,100
And besides,

30
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,230
when have I ever lied to you?

31
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,030
Right? Come on.

32
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,580
Don't turn your back on money.

33
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,310
Here.

34
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,660
(On October 30th,)

35
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,660
(famed author Louis Cha
from Hong Kong, China)

36
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,380
(passed away in Hong Kong, China
at the age of 94.)

37
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,350
(Mr. Louis Cha)

38
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,860
(left us with a romantic
and chivalrous martial arts world)

39
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,860
(and his passing)

40
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,350
(marked the end of an era.)

41
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,190
What happened here?

42
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,640
They're tearing the whole place down.

43
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,580
Shui.

44
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,230
Xue Cheng.

45
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,510
It's been a long time.

46
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,310
Shui.

47
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,030
Ze.

48
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,260
Zhou.

49
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,070
It's been a while.

50
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,540
Mao.

51
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,420
Have a seat. I already ordered for us.

52
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,860
How long has it been?

53
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,100
Way too long.

54
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,350
What, seven or eight years?

55
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,100
Sounds about right.

56
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,070
Come on, let's drink.

57
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,380
Cheers.

58
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,980
Director Zhou.

59
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,140
Your new movie's box office

60
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,350
has already passed 500 million, right?

61
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,910
Yeah.

62
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,860
Half a billion.

63
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,470
That's right.

64
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,350
That's actually
why I brought you guys together today.

65
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,750
Back then, I couldn't do much.

66
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,020
I let you all down.

67
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,780
But now, I've made it.

68
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,190
Now I can finally
make the movies I want.

69
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,070
I can use the scripts I believe in.

70
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,380
I can pick the team I want to work with.

71
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,820
I brought you here today

72
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,820
because I want
the whole Useless Corner crew

73
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,630
to get back together.

74
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,140
Let's make another movie.

75
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,550
What do you say?

76
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,580
We can't even get everyone back.

77
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:42,990
What's the point?

78
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,990
So, you came today

79
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,430
just to talk about movies with us?

80
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,630
You really don't want to know

81
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,950
how she's doing now?

82
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,260
Is that it?

83
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,260
So, you've seen her?

84
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,020
No.

85
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,140
It's fine.

86
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,460
To me, it's all in the past now.

87
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,140
I brought you all here

88
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,310
because I want to ask.

89
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,580
Can we make the best movie
in China together?

90
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:36,900
Zhou Shui.

91
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,020
This is beyond me.

92
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,820
I can't do it.

93
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,430
But you can.

94
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,070
What do you mean, Xue Cheng?

95
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,310
What do you mean?

96
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,550
Director Zhou.

97
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,070
I wish you smooth sailing ahead.

98
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,310
All the best to you.

99
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,020
See you.

100
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:29,990
Zhou Shui?

101
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,700
Zhou Shui, listen.

102
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,380
I absolutely crushed it today.

103
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,750
I landed a car commercial!

104
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,550
And that client is super generous.

105
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,460
I really think

106
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,550
we're gonna make a fortune this time.

107
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,430
Why are you zoning out?

108
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,700
Get a drink for the heroine.

109
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,020
Sure.

110
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,260
Zhou Shui.

111
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,260
Can you stop drinking all the time?

112
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,580
You drink when you're troubled.

113
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,460
Drink water instead.

114
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,820
(During that time,)

115
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,260
(I kept trying to imagine)

116
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,110
(that I wasn't alone.)

117
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,670
(But reality hit hard.)

118
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,950
(I was alone.)

119
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,140
(Just me. No one else.)

120
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,220
Zhou Shui, oh my god.

121
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,140
Why did Beijing shut off the heater

122
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,190
so early this year?

123
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,430
I need to dive
under the blanket right now.

124
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,140
Turn the lights off, will you?

125
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,150
Friends, listen up.

126
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,220
I just found this hidden gem
of a short film.

127
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,700
It's super low-budget,

128
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,950
with no-name actors.

129
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,390
The effects are totally cheap too.

130
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,620
But seriously,

131
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,190
it's so touching.

132
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,740
The director must be telling

133
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,950
her own story.

134
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,190
That's what makes it so real.

135
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,340
You really shouldn't
miss this little film.

136
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,820
It's called "Such A Good Love".

137
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,910
On January 1st, 2008,

138
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,500
at exactly midnight,

139
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,550
we fell in love in Beijing.

140
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,220
Happy New Year, Dai Daji.

141
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,860
I like you.

142
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,100
Let's stay in Beijing together.

143
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,700
(Happy New Year, Dai Daji.)

144
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,070
(I like you.)

145
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,620
(Let's stay in Beijing together.)

146
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,620
(Beijing has banned fireworks.)

147
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,070
(It's fine. No one will find out.)

148
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,550
(Fireworks are banned in Beijing!)

149
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,150
(Yeah, you! Stop right there!
Put it out!)

150
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,700
(Daji, listen to me.)

151
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,740
(If it weren't for you,)

152
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,580
(I wouldn't have come to Beijing.)

153
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:35,950
(If not for you,)

154
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,340
(I would've quit making movies)

155
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,950
(after those setbacks.)

156
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:39,700
(I would've never)

157
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,700
(written this script.)

158
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,700
(If it weren't for you,)

159
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,700
(I wouldn't be anything.)

160
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,150
(So I think you're wrong.)

161
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,340
(Coming to Beijing to be with you)

162
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,310
(was the best decision I ever made.)

163
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,100
(I know now.)

164
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,790
(I know what our movie)

165
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,910
(should be called.)

166
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,310
(What is it?)

167
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,270
(Such A Good Love.)

168
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,310
(It wasn't just love I gave up on,)

169
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,390
(but the dreams we once shared.)

170
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,860
(Autumn 2018, Ezhou)

171
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,460
Madam.

172
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,270
- Madam.
- Who are you looking for?

173
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,820
Hi, I'm looking for Xiaoya.

174
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,950
You mean Deng Xiaoya?

175
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,390
Yes.

176
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:07,740
(Tomb of Loving Mother Deng Xiaoya
Daughter: Dai Daji)

177
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,550
She'd been sick for a while.

178
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:13,310
Late last year, they found out
it had turned into cancer.

179
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,070
She passed away just after the New Year.

180
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,310
Old neighbors were all saying

181
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,460
she was thinking of her daughter.

182
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,150
She didn't want
to become a burden to her.

183
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,950
That poor girl, Daji.

184
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,390
She's been through too much.

185
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,430
It was an unbearable time for her.

186
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,460
We were all afraid
she wouldn't make it through.

187
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,460
After her mother's funeral,

188
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,700
she sold the house.

189
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,820
She left.

190
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,460
(I was the one taking care of her
before she left.)

191
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,550
(One time,)

192
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,430
(I saw Daji running down
to the riverbank alone.)

193
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,460
(She stood there,
yelling at the ships on the river.)

194
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,270
(But I couldn't hear
what she was shouting.)

195
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,500
(It just seemed like
she needed to let it all out.)

196
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,310
(Before I came to Ezhou,)

197
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,860
(I imagined all sorts of endings.)

198
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,030
(But I never thought
it would be like this.)

199
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,150
(Is the river deep?)

200
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,100
(Yeah, really deep.)

201
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,270
So what happens if I jump in?

202
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,460
You die.

203
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,310
Alright then, let's make a bet.

204
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,390
If I jump and don't die,

205
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,390
we get back together.

206
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,580
(That suffocating moment)

207
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,310
(snapped my mind awake.)

208
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,820
(I knew I was gambling.)

209
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,740
(Gambling on whether)

210
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,910
(she'd show up like in the movies.)

211
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,430
You wanna die that bad?

212
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,070
I had to save your life!

213
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,620
What kind of man are you, snowflake?

214
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,310
I didn't want to die.

215
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,700
I just wanted to make a bet.

216
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,860
Have I seen you before?

217
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,820
Dig in, warm yourself up.

218
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,030
Try the hot pot I made.

219
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,820
See if I've improved at all.

220
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,580
It's pretty good,

221
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,950
but still not quite the real deal.

222
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,580
I really don't have
the knack for hot pot.

223
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,670
Is the restaurant running now?

224
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:01,820
No.

225
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,070
This place...

226
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,030
got me drowning in debt.

227
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,340
I'm closing it down tomorrow.

228
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,550
My husband ran off too.

229
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,670
He left us behind.

230
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,580
"Us?"

231
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,550
It's been three months.

232
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,700
Then what were you doing
by the river today?

233
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,430
Actually, I wasn't the one
who saved you.

234
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,340
It was this little one.

235
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,700
Fate stepped in to save us both.

236
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,860
All these years later,

237
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,820
and you still haven't
gotten your girl back?

238
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,950
I did, last time.

239
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,980
But I lost her all over again.

240
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,460
At least you're still
trying to find her.

241
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,500
Just keep going.

242
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,070
One day, you'll get her back.

243
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,670
I won't.

244
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,220
How would you know?

245
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,310
I'm not worthy of her.

246
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,070
I came here

247
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,030
to see how she's been doing.

248
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,460
Where she is. What she's up to.

249
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,950
We were about to get married.

250
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,430
Her mom didn't exactly like me,

251
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,430
but at least...

252
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,310
She taught me how to cook Hubei cuisine.

253
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,390
She said once we were married,

254
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,820
it'd make her feel at home.

255
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,390
But that home is gone now.

256
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,670
Her mom passed away.

257
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,620
I just found out today.

258
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,220
Seems she doesn't need me anymore.

259
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,860
So, finding her now
doesn't mean anything.

260
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,950
Someone told me they saw her
by the river.

261
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,260
She was shouting things by herself.

262
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,060
I've always wanted to know
what she said.

263
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,980
But, I guess I'll never get the chance.

264
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,830
You know,

265
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,950
there are a lot of things
we'll never know.

266
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,700
Maybe the answers don't matter.

267
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,460
So, what now?

268
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,460
Where will you go?

269
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,870
No idea.

270
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,980
Me neither.

271
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,700
Maybe I'll head back to Chongqing.

272
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,150
I'll get a cart and sell ice jelly.

273
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,780
Ice jelly?

274
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,500
You know how to make that?

275
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,540
My hot pot might not be great,

276
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,540
but my ice jelly's actually pretty good.

277
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,700
Then maybe

278
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,450
I'll just open
a hot pot place in Chongqing.

279
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,870
My dad runs one anyway.

280
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,190
I can follow in his footsteps.

281
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,670
Sounds good. You run the place,

282
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,980
I'll run the ice jelly stand.

283
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,950
Hot pot and ice jelly
are best friends anyway.

284
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,540
With our skills,

285
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,150
we'll be raking in a fortune together.

286
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,700
I'll go make you a bowl right now.

287
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,110
You'll be sold on it.

288
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,020
You really know how?

289
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,980
Totally.

290
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,830
(That night, I had ten beers.)

291
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,950
(And at the last second of 11:29 p.m.,)

292
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,830
(I suddenly made a decision.)

293
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:30,830
Ms. Chao.

294
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,640
I've already returned the deposit.

295
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,300
I'm not doing the movie anymore.

296
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,540
Are you out of your mind?

297
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,150
You're literally the most

298
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,780
popular director in the country!

299
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,460
If you back out of this movie now,

300
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,300
think about...

301
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,190
Boss!

302
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,670
Where's the boss?

303
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,260
Coming!

304
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,740
Hold on, hold on.

305
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,260
I am seriously overwhelmed.

306
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,150
One spicy hot pot!

307
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,780
Sorry for the wait!

308
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,430
Here, take your time and enjoy.

309
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,500
One ice jelly, right? Coming right up!

310
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,780
Zhou.

311
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,830
Table 8 is done. Clear it up.

312
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,500
Next up is table 35.

313
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:04,810
Got it.

314
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:05,110
Hurry!

315
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,220
Two ice jellies for table 3!

316
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:06,830
Okay!

317
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,220
How's the taste?

318
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,430
Not bad, right?

319
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,950
We're a new shop.

320
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,300
Bring your friends here

321
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,020
to have a try, yeah?

322
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,670
Take your time, enjoy.

323
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,870
Table 35, here we go.

324
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,780
Come on!

325
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,220
What will it be?

326
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:22,700
Five for us.

327
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,350
Five!

328
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,220
(Homemade Ice Jelly)

329
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:31,740
(Spring 2025, Chongqing)

330
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,500
You know,

331
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:36,830
for something that started
as a random decision,

332
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,630
I've been at it for seven years now.

333
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,540
Business is doing well.

334
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,540
Right?

335
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,020
And look at this place.

336
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,590
The location

337
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,700
is right where the two rivers meet.

338
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,020
The vibe is perfect.

339
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:51,830
Yeah.

340
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,590
What about Daji?

341
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,630
So you never reached out to her again?

342
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,060
The next time I heard about her,

343
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,910
she was already a successful producer.

344
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,300
She was chasing the dream I left behind.

345
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,150
And what I'm doing now

346
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,150
has nothing to do with movies anymore.

347
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,540
Such is life.

348
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:11,950
So,

349
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,400
you lost her because of a movie,

350
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,590
and for the rest of your life,

351
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,460
you're never making the movies you love?

352
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,870
Are you punishing yourself?

353
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,390
Living forever in the pain

354
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,910
of losing your dream?

355
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,630
Is that it?

356
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,220
It's not that tragic.

357
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,430
Well.

358
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,150
Then, why write the novel?

359
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,430
It's like digging a hole

360
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,830
to let out all the things
you couldn't say.

361
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,220
And you posted it online.

362
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,540
If you really wanted her to see it,

363
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,740
then turn that story into a movie.

364
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,430
Come to Beijing with me.

365
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,670
Meet my friend.

366
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,110
I'm not going to Beijing, Zihao.

367
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,190
And I'm not selling the rights either.

368
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,060
(Excellence Awards Ceremony)

369
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,020
This was from
the awards ceremony last year.

370
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,430
Do you remember?

371
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,950
Of course I do. You took that photo.

372
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,630
Out of all these pictures,

373
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,300
this is still my favorite.

374
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,700
You're so full of yourself.

375
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,150
It's not that.

376
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,220
It's because when my mom was young,

377
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,460
she took one just like it.

378
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,950
Same angle and everything.

379
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,150
You really do look like her.

380
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,830
There's this spark in your eyes.

381
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,780
The same as hers.

382
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,500
I used to hate it when people said that.

383
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,350
Why should I have to be like her?

384
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,220
But now, I actually feel kind of lucky.

385
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,540
At least...

386
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,870
a part of her is still in this world.

387
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:45,830
It's in me.

388
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,460
Hey,

389
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,670
I'm buying this photo, okay?

390
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,640
I'll wire you the money.

391
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,460
No. I'm giving it to you.

392
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,460
No way.

393
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,450
It's your first exhibition,
I have to support it.

394
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,500
It's not my solo show. It's his.

395
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,640
All of these in this row too.

396
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,360
(Seize the Gap of Light)
Earlier this year.

397
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,460
That one over there
has a bit more artistic weight.

398
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,870
But aren't some of these photos

399
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:06,870
taken by you?

400
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,740
They sell for more under his name.

401
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,300
That's not the point.

402
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,190
You deserve to have
your name on them.

403
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,260
Names are just for show.

404
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,060
But money is real.

405
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,020
Ms. Dai,

406
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,780
do you know how much we've made

407
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,220
since the start of this year?

408
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,390
I know it's a ton.

409
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,740
Do you think it's worth it?

410
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,670
Of course.

411
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,020
More than half of that money is mine.

412
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,300
But your talent and skill

413
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,630
remained unseen.

414
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,110
Do you still think it's worth it?

415
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,740
You sound like someone born in the '80s.

416
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,460
Do I?

417
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,830
Once I reach financial freedom,

418
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,910
I'll have nothing to worry.

419
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,950
See? You're hesitating.

420
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,110
You didn't even sound convinced
when you said that.

421
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,300
That is not true.

422
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,830
I finished the book.

423
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,830
Not that book again.

424
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,190
I seriously recommend you

425
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,740
buy the rights ASAP.

426
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,340
I'm exhausted right now.

427
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,230
I don't have the energy
for such a long story.

428
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,780
I can tell you the story.

429
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,830
Fine. Keep it short.

430
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,540
The story

431
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,870
takes place in the summer of 2007.

432
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,670
Under the bluest skies
and clearest seas...

433
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:16,540
Tong.

434
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,590
Let me introduce you to someone.

435
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,390
Come meet them.

436
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,110
Who is it?

437
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,060
Our fortune maker.

438
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,670
They just bought over 30 paintings.

439
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,260
They're decorating their home with them.

440
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,300
Ms. Dai, perfect timing.

441
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,870
Our client says they know you.

442
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:27,460
Come.

443
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,700
They know me?

444
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,150
- Let's go.
- Come.

445
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:30,950
Let's go.

446
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,980
Ms. Shen, let me introduce you.

447
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,910
This is my girlfriend, Tong Leyi.

448
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,700
This is Ms. Dai, and this is Ms. Shen.

449
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,020
Daji.

450
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,830
Long time no see.

451
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,260
His name's Timmy.

452
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,670
Liao's always wanted a son.

453
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,740
It's been his biggest dream in life.

454
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,460
Ms. Shen,

455
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,910
your purchases are all packed.

456
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,540
Great.

457
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,390
I'm all set here.

458
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,630
Bring the car around.

459
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,110
Actually,

460
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,740
I want you to meet someone.

461
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,430
Timmy, let's go.

462
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,260
- Timmy.
- Uncle.

463
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,350
How was it?

464
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,350
Did you have fun?

465
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:29,700
Yeah!

466
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:30,670
It was fun!

467
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,260
Daji, long time no see.

468
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:36,950
Dumbbell?

469
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,950
What? Hold on.

470
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,460
You...

471
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,150
You want to know what happened?

472
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,260
Of course I do.

473
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,540
(Two years ago...)

474
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,460
Don't be scared.

475
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:04,590
It's daddy.

476
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,980
I want to go home.

477
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:07,910
Everyone, leave us.

478
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,780
I made your favorite
ginseng chicken soup.

479
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,830
After being overseas for so long,

480
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,390
I almost forgot how to make it.

481
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,980
I wonder if it still tastes the same.

482
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,540
Try it.

483
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,460
Didn't you always say

484
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,460
soup has to be finished
while it's hot to be nourishing?

485
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,430
I did all this for your own good.

486
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,950
You saw your son, right?

487
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,910
Are you happy?

488
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,260
You have everything
you ever wanted in life.

489
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,870
I really do admire you.

490
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,700
How do you live with yourself?

491
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,630
You never thought about

492
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,590
how much others had to pay

493
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,590
for your selfish desires.

494
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,300
Liao.

495
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:47,780
I must thank you.

496
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,500
You really did teach me a lot.

497
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,540
You made me who I am today.

498
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,060
According to Mr. Liao's will,

499
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:31,150
Liao Yueyang is his only legal heir.

500
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,780
The daughters from the mother's side

501
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,220
will get married eventually.

502
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,390
Until the young master comes of age,

503
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:39,540
you'll be in charge
of managing the assets.

504
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,190
Thank you all for your trust.

505
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:47,390
Next, I'd like to take some time off.

506
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,430
Where do you want to go?

507
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,460
I want to go home.

508
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,430
Who are you looking for?

509
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,830
You're Mei, right?

510
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,630
You've grown so much.

511
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,430
There she goes again.

512
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,590
Who are you?

513
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,540
I'm your sister, Luo Guixi.

514
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:35,500
Here.

515
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:37,460
Sister.

516
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,150
I'm not drinking.

517
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,300
I have an idea.

518
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,350
You know how livestreaming

519
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,910
is super popular now?

520
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,110
Why don't you lend me
some startup money?

521
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,870
I want to try streaming too

522
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,350
and become an influencer or something.

523
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,150
Guixi,

524
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:55,870
your little brother
is working really hard now.

525
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,780
If you make something of yourself,

526
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,500
don't forget about him, alright?

527
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:03,190
Sister.

528
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,590
My second child

529
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,390
is finally a boy, right?

530
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,500
I've been thinking.

531
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,830
We should move to the city.

532
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,390
Yeah.

533
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,740
To Guixi,

534
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,670
this is but a tiny amount of money.

535
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,110
Right, Guixi?

536
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,110
To your health, Sister.

537
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,830
Why isn't Mei in school?

538
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,110
She is...

539
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,020
She is not smart like you.

540
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,220
School is too much for her.

541
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,600
We'll marry her off in a few years.

542
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,590
You want money?

543
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,220
Fine.

544
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,500
But I have one condition.

545
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,670
Starting tomorrow,

546
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,780
Mei has to go back to school.

547
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,260
Next semester,

548
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,300
she's going to
the best high school in the city.

549
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,460
She'll go to college.

550
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,870
I'll pay for all of it.

551
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,260
However,

552
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,870
if her education gets cut off
because of you,

553
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,870
you won't get a single cent.

554
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,910
I'll even make you give back
what you took.

555
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,300
Is that clear?

556
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,190
All packed?

557
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,110
Yes.

558
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,110
Do you like the backpack I got you?

559
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:02,910
I love it.

560
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,390
Go on. Study hard.

561
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,110
For your bright future.

562
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,590
Thank you, Auntie.

563
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,500
Bye, Auntie.

564
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:12,830
Bye.

565
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,460
Alright, wait for me.

566
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:14,950
Okay.

567
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,020
Guixi?

568
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:19,830
Luo Guixi?

569
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,220
And you are...

570
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,740
You don't remember me?

571
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,980
I'm your old classmate, Shen Jingshu.

572
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:34,060
I came back after graduating
from the teacher's college.

573
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,220
I started teaching at our school.

574
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,390
At first,

575
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:40,190
I figured it'd count
as some support in a poor area.

576
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,950
I'd get some experience

577
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,220
before heading off
to the provincial capital.

578
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,980
But then, I got married.

579
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,830
I settled down.

580
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,670
You've had a good life.

581
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,980
It's been smooth sailing for you.

582
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,670
You're the one with the good life.

583
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,060
You were the only one in the village

584
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,300
who got into college.

585
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,020
And it was in Beijing.

586
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,390
I've always envied you.

587
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,980
I envied you.

588
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,870
For what?

589
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,350
You have such a beautiful name.

590
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:10,780
Jingshu.

591
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,540
"Graceful as a maiden,
waiting by the city wall."

592
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:17,080
"Longing but unseen, he scratches
his head and paces in sorrow."

593
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,460
My husband will be home soon.

594
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,110
Let's have dinner together tonight.

595
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:25,740
Sure.

596
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,980
Is he from our village?

597
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,220
No, he's from out of town.

598
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,190
You don't know him.

599
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,630
I'll introduce you later.

600
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,060
Alright, dinner's on me.

601
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:37,540
Yalin!

602
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,980
This is my husband, Liang Yalin.

603
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,870
Mommy.

604
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,950
This is my old classmate, Luo Guixi.

605
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,110
This is 100,000 yuan.

606
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,740
Your annual salary.

607
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:05,430
It's enough to put your daughter
through college.

608
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:08,590
It's enough to buy a car.

609
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,460
Take whatever you want.

610
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,630
Tell Liang Yalin

611
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:16,150
that from now on,
he has nothing to do with you or them.

612
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,300
Please don't do this.

613
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,500
This is between you and me.

614
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,260
Don't drag them into it, okay?

615
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,110
I was talking to your wife, not you.

616
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:43,540
Yes or no?

617
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,390
Luo Guixi, you...

618
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,390
Call me Shen Jingshu.

619
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,590
Take the money.

620
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,740
From now on,

621
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,830
I am Shen Jingshu.

622
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:14,910
And just like that,
I got him back again.

623
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,750
We're really happy now.

624
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:18,830
Are you?

625
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:19,710
Of course.

626
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,620
It was me who let her down before,

627
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,560
but she didn't blame me at all.

628
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:24,790
She's been really good to me.

629
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:26,760
She brought me to work in Beijing,

630
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,540
and I make over 100 grand a month.

631
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,140
The clothes, the shoes, even the car

632
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,230
were all from her.

633
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,020
Can you believe it, Daji?

634
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:35,950
All these years,

635
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,270
and his size hasn't changed a bit.

636
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:38,230
He hasn't gone fat.

637
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,140
He's still exactly the same.

638
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,710
We're heading out.

639
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,180
Okay.

640
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,230
See you around, Daji.

641
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:46,790
Right.

642
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:49,910
Bye.

643
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,790
Jingshu.

644
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,910
When you were talking to me just now,

645
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,430
you said Dumbbell was married.

646
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,390
So did you...

647
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,660
Did you break up someone else's family?

648
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,180
You think that'd make you happy?

649
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,230
I didn't break them up.

650
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,580
He was mine to begin with.

651
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,270
That woman was just a stand-in.

652
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,980
Have you forgotten? I'm Shen Jingshu.

653
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,430
Money can't buy love.

654
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,430
You'll regret this, Jingshu.

655
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,230
Maybe. But I really don't care.

656
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,350
Let's go.

657
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,140
Bye.

658
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,020
Alright.

659
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,020
Bye.

660
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:40,100
Is this twisted
or simply an act of evil?

661
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,500
It gave me chills. I'm so creeped out.

662
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:44,830
Like a horror movie.

663
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:47,750
Stop it.

664
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,100
What horror movie?

665
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,980
Then, let's talk romance movies.

666
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,580
Even worse. They annoy me.

667
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,710
No way.

668
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,580
I already invited the author to Beijing.

669
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,750
What for?

670
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:58,620
To meet you.

671
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,980
(We Actually Broke Up In 2025)

672
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,270
Yatian, hurry up.

673
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,430
The photographer's waiting.

674
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,140
Why are you crying?

675
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,020
I'm okay.

676
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,660
Come on. Which outfit are we using?

677
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,350
You're reading this novel too?

678
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,870
It's really well written.

679
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,910
Their story is way more
exciting than ours.

680
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,430
But they broke up.

681
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:27,950
We're about to get married.

682
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,020
I know.

683
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,580
We have a car, a house, stable jobs,

684
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,950
and both families are supportive.

685
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,870
It's just that...

686
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,310
It's not that exciting.

687
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,750
It's almost kind of dull.

688
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,390
Zihao.

689
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,460
Let me ask you again.

690
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,100
Tell me the truth.

691
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,830
Okay.

692
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,140
Have you really liked me all this time?

693
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,060
To be honest,

694
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:04,620
I used to really, really like you.

695
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,950
But back then, I didn't have the guts.

696
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,710
I didn't try to woo you.

697
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,430
Later on,

698
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,580
I fell for someone else.

699
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,790
Of course, that didn't work out.

700
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,350
When I saw you again,

701
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,310
I thought

702
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,270
I could fall for you like I used to.

703
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:31,710
But to be honest,

704
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,830
I just couldn't do it.

705
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:40,620
Yatian.

706
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,500
Let me ask you something.

707
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:44,980
Go ahead.

708
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,540
Did you ever like me?

709
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,580
How about we do something

710
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,830
the couple in the book

711
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,100
never had the courage to do?

712
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,390
What is it? Say it.

713
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:05,830
Face to face,

714
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,100
and with no regrets,

715
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,660
we say goodbye.

716
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,580
Alright.

717
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,270
I'll go first.

718
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,270
Goodbye, Su Zihao.

719
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,540
Goodbye.

720
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,790
Chen Yatian.

721
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,100
Sansan, Juan.

722
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,980
- You look amazing.
- Shui.

723
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:35,870
What's going on?

724
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:37,580
Shooting wedding photos?

725
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,020
What's up?

726
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:44,550
Sansan's on break.

727
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,330
He'll go to elementary school
in September.

728
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:47,830
We're taking him on a trip.

729
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,500
Sansan, where are you guys going?

730
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,500
To Chengdu to see the pandas.

731
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,230
Pandas in Chengdu, huh?

732
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,540
Chengdu isn't that far away.

733
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,140
We should go somewhere farther.

734
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,710
So, where are we going?

735
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:05,270
We're going to Beijing.

736
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,750
There's Universal Studios in Beijing.

737
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,580
They have Minions,

738
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,620
Harry Potter, Transformers.

739
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,540
Excited?

740
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,310
I love the idea!

741
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,100
That settles it.

742
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,930
I want to go to
Universal Studios in Beijing.

743
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:16,750
Off to Beijing!

744
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,950
Perfect. Your Uncle Zhou
can meet someone there too.

745
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,750
Don't drag me into this. I'm not going.

746
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,350
Going to Beijing is a good idea.

747
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,060
You haven't been back in years.

748
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,450
Might be nice to revisit the past.

749
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:28,870
What for?

750
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,750
You haven't gone back

751
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,140
since you left.

752
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:32,810
Exactly.

753
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,180
An investor offered to help him

754
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,580
open a restaurant in Beijing.

755
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,710
He turned it down.

756
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,100
Beijing has no decent food.

757
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,350
People there don't get hotpot at all.

758
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,060
Sansan, come here.

759
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,460
Are you ditching me

760
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,580
for Beijing?

761
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,230
Why not go to Shanghai instead?

762
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,910
They have Disneyland too.

763
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,870
No! I want to go to Beijing!

764
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:54,940
Beijing! Beijing!

765
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,980
You want to go everywhere.

766
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,870
Come on, bedtime.

767
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,060
Alright, you two go ahead.

768
00:39:59,060 --> 00:39:59,660
Your time.

769
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,910
Got it. Bye, Juan.

770
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,460
You should dress like this more often.

771
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:05,910
Give me back my chair.

772
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,710
Troublemaker.

773
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,540
Why won't you go to Beijing?

774
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,180
Is it because she's there?

775
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,350
Quit with the nonsense.

776
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,980
What are you so afraid of?

777
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,460
Who says I'm afraid?

778
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,950
Then, you're just punishing yourself.

779
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:23,060
(Closed from today)
Fine. If you were me,

780
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,310
would you go to Beijing?

781
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,660
Would you see the girl you love?

782
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:27,580
Of course I would.

783
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,350
I'm not marrying Yatian.

784
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:32,350
And I didn't take
any wedding photos today.

785
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:33,910
I'm going to Beijing

786
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,580
to see Tong Leyi.

787
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,540
Do you dare?

788
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,430
Would you go with me?

789
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:39,830
Would you dare to see

790
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:41,540
the girl you once loved?

791
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:53,910
Ms. Dai.

792
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,150
- Tong Leyi.
- Are you busy?

793
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,230
Why are you showing up
at my office again?

794
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,620
Come on, we have a meeting.

795
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,540
What meeting?

796
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,830
I had the author waiting
in the meeting room.

797
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:04,690
Are you nuts?

798
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:06,180
I never said I was doing this project.

799
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:06,870
Why do this?

800
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,010
I haven't even read the book.

801
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:08,870
That's fine.

802
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,870
Once you meet the author,

803
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,230
you'll know what the story's about.

804
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,270
Hello, Ms. Dai.

805
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,660
Wait, aren't you...

806
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,430
I'm the author's agent.

807
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,710
Hello, Tong Leyi.

808
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,020
Hello, Su Zihao.

809
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,430
What are you two playing at?

810
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,230
Dai.

811
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:26,910
Come on.

812
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,020
Hurry up.

813
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,460
The author's already here.

814
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,060
Dai.

815
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,460
Go on, introduce yourself.

816
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,790
