00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,220
=Episode 23=

3
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,100
(Autumn 2024, Chongqing)
Sansan got enrolled. I'm so grateful.

4
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,740
(Autumn 2024, Chongqing)
It's nothing.

5
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,540
Hey.

6
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,350
Is the hotpot spicy for you?

7
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,380
- It's fine.
- It's fine.

8
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,660
- Zihao.
- We're from Chongqing.

9
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,440
Mr. Zhou.

10
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,590
- No need.
- It's from Juan.

11
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,700
A kind gesture from us.

12
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,070
Take it.

13
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,700
I can't accept this, Ms. Juan.

14
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,540
Mr. Zhou, I've known you for years.

15
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,030
There's no need for that.

16
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,910
For years?

17
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,660
Haven't we just met recently?

18
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,470
- Come.
- Let's eat.

19
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,470
When's your wedding?

20
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,900
I'll definitely prepare a big gift.

21
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,190
We...

22
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,310
Almost.

23
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,980
Right. We've prepared everything.

24
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,630
Soon.

25
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,820
Dig in.

26
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,260
How about we watch a movie?

27
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,660
As long as you have time.

28
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,920
What movie do you want to watch?

29
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,380
Anything.

30
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,190
Anything?

31
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,630
All right.

32
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,940
(Scandalous Couple)

33
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,100
What's this?

34
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,700
"Scandalous Couple"?

35
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,950
What does that mean?

36
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,190
Since we're saying goodbye,

37
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,140
let's do it gracefully.

38
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,510
No loose ends.

39
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,380
Bye-bye.

40
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,260
Goodbye.

41
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,190
I'll take care of this hard drive.

42
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,950
(I'll return the hard drive
to Zhou Shui tomorrow.)

43
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,630
(So, we have learned of everything)

44
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,950
(about Zhou Shui and Dai Daji.)

45
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,910
(I'll hand in my notice
to Ms. Dai tomorrow.)

46
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,260
(Bye, Su Zihao.)

47
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,540
(Bye, Tong Leyi.)

48
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,580
Ms. Dai.

49
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,070
Why haven't you left yet?

50
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,430
Please sign this for me.

51
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,330
(Resignation Letter)
This is my resignation letter.

52
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,700
Zhou.

53
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,380
Zihao is here.

54
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,460
Zihao, have a seat.

55
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,510
I'm making chili oil.

56
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,110
Is there something wrong

57
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,340
with Sansan's enrollment?

58
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,550
No, everything's going well.

59
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,140
Really?

60
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,110
Yes.

61
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:36,990
Thank you.

62
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,900
Well.

63
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,260
You did me such a big favor.

64
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,110
I'll surely repay you handsomely.

65
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:43,990
Seriously?

66
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,110
Why are you always thinking

67
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,460
about these worldly matters?

68
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,310
Where did the old you go?

69
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,580
What is that?

70
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,430
The old me?

71
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,550
You were a promising man.

72
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,190
Why do you want to quit?

73
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,510
You're jumping ship?

74
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,140
No, I'm not.

75
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,510
I'm just too tired from work.

76
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,820
You want an easy life?

77
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,460
Then why even come to work?

78
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,700
You could've done that earlier.

79
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,700
Guess why I come to work.

80
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,670
Do you remember

81
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,870
I said

82
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,870
I've known you for a long time?

83
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,670
That's not quite right.

84
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,550
To be accurate,

85
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,340
I know the old you.

86
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,750
What do you mean?

87
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,110
(Scandalous Couple)
I know the story between Dai Daji and you.

88
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,310
About you and Zhou Shui,

89
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,340
I know everything about it.

90
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,580
Thank you.

91
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,430
You went through every pitfall
ahead of me.

92
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,140
I remember it all.

93
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,260
To cherish my life,

94
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,440
I must stay away from love.

95
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,190
But what you saw in those videos

96
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,340
isn't the whole story.

97
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,380
We were apart,

98
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,380
but that wasn't the end.

99
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,380
We got back together afterward.

100
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,430
We were together

101
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,820
for ten years.

102
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,070
Do you want to know
what happened after that?

103
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,020
Do you want to know

104
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,780
how it ended?

105
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:44,500
(Spring 2017, Beijing)

106
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,670
(A few months later,)

107
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,020
(Zhou Shui and I)

108
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,310
(boarded a plane
heading to the film set.)

109
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,950
(Later, I found out)

110
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,140
(Jingshu left that day too.)

111
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,510
Passengers traveling to Haikou,

112
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,580
please proceed to Gate 2 immediately
for boarding.

113
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,580
Passengers traveling to Haikou,

114
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,670
please proceed to Gate 2 immediately
for boarding.

115
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,780
Passengers traveling to New York,

116
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,990
please proceed to Gate 13 immediately
for boarding.

117
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,110
Passengers traveling to New York,

118
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,310
please proceed to Gate 13 immediately
for boarding.

119
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,430
(Jingshu didn't get an abortion.)

120
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,440
(She walked through)

121
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,550
(a completely different life)

122
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,460
(with the baby.)

123
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,510
(At that time, I didn't know)

124
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,630
(Zhou Shui and I wouldn't
come back together)

125
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,820
(after leaving Beijing.)

126
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,510
(Haikou Airport)
So hot.

127
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:29,860
Hi.

128
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,780
Director Zhou?

129
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,750
Yes. Zhou Shui.

130
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,910
Hello.

131
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,390
Hi.

132
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,070
I'm the production manager.

133
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:35,950
Chen Biao.

134
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,150
Just call me Biao.

135
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,340
- Biao.
- Welcome to Hainan.

136
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,430
And this is...

137
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,980
Also a director of this movie.

138
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,980
I'm Dai Daji.

139
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,460
Two directors?

140
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,340
- Yeah.
- Right.

141
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,790
Director Dai and I
will co-direct this movie.

142
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,030
Didn't Man tell you about this?

143
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,670
Let's get in the car first.

144
00:08:57,191 --> 00:08:57,950
I've visited

145
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,030
the main settings these past few days.

146
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,550
I've come up with plans.

147
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,910
Take a look at this.

148
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,190
This is the real dorm.

149
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:05,910
Overall,

150
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,580
it's too old.

151
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,270
Plus, it's dirty, messy, and rundown.

152
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,460
The space is cramped.

153
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,460
It'll be inconvenient

154
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,220
for everyone

155
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,620
to work there.

156
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,460
Now, look at this one.

157
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,620
This is the ideal dorm.

158
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,910
The atmosphere

159
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,270
and the layout

160
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,860
are easier to work with.

161
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,980
Since the dorm is our main set,

162
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,500
I suggest we build a set.

163
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,030
Of course, we have to build a set.

164
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,340
Anyway, just as we discussed
in the meeting.

165
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,460
Xiaozhi,

166
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,550
you deal with the design...

167
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,670
Ms. Chao has arrived.

168
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,860
Ms. Chao.

169
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,820
Hi, Ms. Chao.

170
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,500
Sit.

171
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,430
I heard someone wants to build a set?

172
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,550
Director Zhou.

173
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,070
He said the dorm

174
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,310
is one of our main sets,

175
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,310
so he wanted to build a set.

176
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,390
It was me.

177
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,390
What's the budget?

178
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,270
Around 800,000.

179
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,500
Just shoot with a real dorm, okay?

180
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,860
Don't waste the budget.

181
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:14,500
Sure.

182
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,220
Ms. Chao,

183
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,270
but the real dorm

184
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,150
is cramped

185
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,500
and dark.

186
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,740
It'll look bad on camera.

187
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,620
Excuse me.

188
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,910
Do you have more experience than me?

189
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,390
I don't think it necessary.

190
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:28,980
Ms. Chao,

191
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,070
it's not about experience.

192
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,030
You told us

193
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,620
that you need a romantic vibe

194
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,740
for this scene.

195
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,620
But if...

196
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,740
Tell me.

197
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,270
If we spend this money,

198
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,700
can we generate another
100 million earnings?

199
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,270
100 million?

200
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,860
Who can guarantee that?

201
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,430
Right.

202
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,700
If you spend the 800,000

203
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,430
and it doesn't generate any profit,

204
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,330
are you going to
take responsibility for that?

205
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,860
Well, that's final.

206
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,270
We'll use a real dorm.

207
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:56,860
Deal.

208
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,070
That's great, Ms. Chao.

209
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,950
That's exactly what we thought.

210
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,150
Come, Xiaozhi.

211
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,340
Show Ms. Chao the proposal.

212
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:02,980
Here you go.

213
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,670
This is the campus we found.

214
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,950
Both Xiaozhi and I agreed

215
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,390
that live-action filming is the best.

216
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,550
Yeah. Look at this.

217
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,790
The area is open.

218
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,790
Right? The cameraman can stand here.

219
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,460
Right.

220
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,030
Besides, the sunlight is strong.

221
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,230
You thought of everything.

222
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,190
The money we save

223
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,430
can be used to improve the set.

224
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:26,820
Let's go.

225
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:29,705
Ms. Chao, Xiaozhi and I discussed it.

226
00:11:29,705 --> 00:11:31,700
Most of the budget has been used.

227
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,316
The space is square
and lacks visual appeal.

228
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,847
Most importantly, the road across that.

229
00:11:36,847 --> 00:11:38,860
- It's a perfect filming spot.
- Exactly.

230
00:11:39,109 --> 00:11:39,996
Scroll up.

231
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,790
Right here.

232
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:49,690
Well.

233
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,270
I didn't know there would be two of you,

234
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,790
so I only prepared one single bed.

235
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,380
But the sheets and blanket are all new.

236
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,460
Once the whole crew arrives,

237
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,700
I'll bring in another bed.

238
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,390
Does the bed even reach one meter?

239
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,950
This is a standard
1.5 meters by 1 meter.

240
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,500
1.5 meters long?

241
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,980
Right. The place is fine, right?

242
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,390
Young directors

243
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,310
should learn to adapt.

244
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,980
You should learn from Ms. Chao.

245
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,070
You're right.

246
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,550
All right.

247
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,980
Which room is she in?

248
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,310
I'll go seek her guidance later.

249
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,390
Ms. Chao is staying
at Hilton in the city.

250
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,150
It's getting late.

251
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,500
You must be tired from the trip.

252
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,460
Rest up.

253
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:22,980
Well.

254
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,950
Let me through.

255
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,500
Make way.

256
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,430
Move the luggage back.

257
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,310
Call me if anything comes up.

258
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,580
She's changing the script

259
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,220
however she wants.

260
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,190
Look at what we're facing.

261
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,670
What more does she want from us?

262
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,980
The place isn't great,

263
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,500
but we've lived in worse,

264
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,220
haven't we?

265
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,460
It's not about this place.

266
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,790
That's nothing.

267
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,940
It's the set.

268
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,500
She won't even give us money for that.

269
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,670
How are we supposed to shoot?

270
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,220
Back when we were at Shendu,

271
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,100
we only had 100 yuan.

272
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,430
We made films with just 100 yuan.

273
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,700
We can do anything!

274
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,550
You can tolerate anything.

275
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,220
We're the directors.

276
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,950
Once we start filming,

277
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,430
we call the shots.

278
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,270
Right?

279
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,700
I'm enduring it!

280
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,670
All right.

281
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,670
I feel better now.

282
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,220
Zhou Shui.

283
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,620
Director Zhou.

284
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,430
Ms. Chao

285
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,150
has assigned you an executive director.

286
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,700
He's quite famous,

287
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,100
so watch your attitude.

288
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,100
Director Feng, this is Director Zhou.

289
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:01,820
Director Feng.

290
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,150
You should get to know each other.

291
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,190
These are the storyboards I made.

292
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,430
You can follow them directly.

293
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,270
We're working on the storyboards now.

294
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,100
You don't need to make new ones.

295
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,030
Ms. Chao said

296
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,100
to use mine.

297
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,220
Wait.

298
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,950
What do you mean by that?

299
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,910
I backed off in the script discussion.

300
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,230
Now I don't even have a say
in the storyboards.

301
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,030
I'm the director.

302
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,430
Can I at least have some input?

303
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,220
Director Zhou,

304
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,190
what films have you directed?

305
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,980
You haven't filmed anything,

306
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,620
and you're sitting in this position.

307
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,220
Have you ever considered

308
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,390
that it's not because of your ability

309
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,670
but just because of your fluke?

310
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,310
If you're lucky,

311
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,310
you need to be obedient.

312
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,030
Let's continue on the storyboards.

313
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,190
Follow mine.

314
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:07,790
Look.

315
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,910
Let go!

316
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,100
Why are you fighting?

317
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:40,790
What's going on?

318
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,190
This...

319
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,580
Who's the director? He or me?

320
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,430
Why should I be sidelined
by an executive director?

321
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,030
Think this through.

322
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,700
The executive director
works for Ms. Chao.

323
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,100
This movie can't start without her,

324
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,220
but nothing will change without you.

325
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,860
If you want to go against her,

326
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,340
you're putting me in a spot.

327
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,860
Am I the one going against her,

328
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,310
or is she the one going against me?

329
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,070
Man,

330
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,100
do you even see what's going on here?

331
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,980
You're too young.

332
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,910
Zhou Shui,

333
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,220
when the movie is released,

334
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,390
the only thing people'll know

335
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,550
is the name of the director.

336
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,790
Who will care about how it was filmed

337
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,190
or whether you had fun making it?

338
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,430
So, you're saying

339
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,150
that my dignity means nothing, right?

340
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,740
All that matters is

341
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,310
whether the director's name is yours.

342
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,070
Take my advice.

343
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,550
Bear with it.

344
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,700
Once the movie is released,

345
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,580
you'll receive
all the respect you deserve.

346
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:13,870
Ms. Chao.

347
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,780
Ms. Chao,

348
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,870
Zhou Shui was wrong

349
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,260
to start a fight.

350
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:17,740
But

351
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,740
the executive director
wasn't completely innocent,

352
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,220
right?

353
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,460
No matter what, Zhou Shui

354
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,300
is the director of this film.

355
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,060
Daji,

356
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,500
I felt like we really clicked

357
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,700
when we worked on the script.

358
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,980
But Zhou Shui is really not the type

359
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,430
I can work with.

360
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,500
You're smart

361
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,150
and talented.

362
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,830
What do you see in him?

363
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,530
Why do you insist on
partnering with him?

364
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,390
Ms. Chao,

365
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,150
Zhou Shui is talented.

366
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,260
He's just young and a bit hot-headed.

367
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,780
He will change.

368
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,700
You see, we haven't
even started shooting yet,

369
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,980
and the executive director
and the production team

370
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,540
are on strike.

371
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,390
How are we supposed to collaborate
in the future?

372
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,700
Yes, Ms. Chao.

373
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,390
I'll apologize on his behalf.

374
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:03,960
Well,

375
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,460
Ms. Chao...

376
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,780
I promise this will never happen again.

377
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,950
Then the only way

378
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,110
is that he leaves and you stay.

379
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,190
You direct the movie on your own.

380
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,150
Is that okay?

381
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,430
Hello?

382
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:21,500
Yes.

383
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,060
Scene 5.

384
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,300
This scene

385
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,830
is a part of the hero's fantasy.

386
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:30,780
I want

387
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,700
to mount the camera on the Steadicam

388
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,910
and give it a 360-degree rotation.

389
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,150
When we change the shot,

390
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,390
we can switch

391
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,700
to new scenes.

392
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,950
I want to make it

393
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,460
a combination of fantasy and reality.

394
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,020
But for...

395
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,980
Zhou Shui, stop it.

396
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,670
A word.

397
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,740
Give me a second.

398
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,110
360-degree rotation.

399
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,870
With each scene...

400
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,630
Zhou Shui, what you're doing now
is useless.

401
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:52,950
How is it useless?

402
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,870
Isn't this what the director does?

403
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,110
Zhou Shui.

404
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,110
It's useless!

405
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,260
By the way,

406
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,460
how's the rewrite for Scene 24 going?

407
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,150
Have you updated it?

408
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,530
Let's not talk about that for now.

409
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,220
Well, Zhou Shui.

410
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:08,780
I...

411
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,950
Ms. Chao has arrived!

412
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,980
- Ms. Chao.
- Hello, Ms. Chao.

413
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,220
No matter what Ms. Chao says,

414
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,010
stay calm.

415
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,390
We'll figure it out together, okay?

416
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,160
- Ms. Chao.
- What?

417
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,780
Promise me.

418
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,020
This script

419
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,540
has had many issues.

420
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,950
We've revised it many times,
but I wasn't satisfied.

421
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,490
But to make sure we meet the schedule,

422
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,060
we had to go ahead with it.

423
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:26,590
But now,

424
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,300
I've received a good script.

425
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,430
Distribute it to them.

426
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,190
This script

427
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,540
is from a genius scriptwriter

428
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,390
I worked with before.

429
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,670
It's fantastic.

430
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,540
I really liked it.

431
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,950
I read three scenes,

432
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,980
and I broke into tears.

433
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,260
Anyway, it's so much better
than the previous one.

434
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,190
I've decided

435
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,020
we'll use this script.

436
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,260
Any objections?

437
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,700
- No.
- No objections.

438
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,500
Very well.

439
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,980
The shooting schedule doesn't change.

440
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,030
(The Day Youth Ends)
Dai,

441
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,430
lead everyone through the script

442
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,950
and come up with a new plan.

443
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,590
We...

444
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,590
Director Zhou, any problem with it?

445
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,350
Ms. Chao,

446
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,150
why are you changing the script?

447
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,350
What gives you the right
to change my script?

448
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,260
The script was terrible.
Why can't I change it?

449
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,190
I've already confirmed
with the investors.

450
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,700
They agreed.

451
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,220
Screw you!

452
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,220
Zhou Shui.

453
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,150
You changed my crew team

454
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,300
and my lines.

455
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,060
Now you want to change my script too?

456
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,390
What do you mean?

457
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,260
Seriously?

458
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,190
I'm the director.

459
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,460
If you change everything,

460
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,870
what am I even here for?

461
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,390
I'm a director.

462
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,460
I want to make the movie I want to make.

463
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,300
I want to make

464
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,540
"Such a Good Love",

465
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,350
not something called

466
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,910
"The Day Youth Ends".

467
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,220
I won't make what I don't like.

468
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:54,630
Wait.

469
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,350
Zhou Shui.

470
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,500
So, Director Zhou,

471
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,430
if we change the script,

472
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,670
you'll quit, right?

473
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,780
- Yes.
- No, Ms. Chao.

474
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,350
I quit!

475
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,150
Shut up!

476
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,430
Ms. Chao, here's the thing.

477
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,540
The script change caught us off guard.

478
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,590
We didn't know about it.

479
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,870
I think we need some time

480
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,300
to think it over, right?

481
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,020
Okay.

482
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,260
I'll let Director Zhou think it through,

483
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,350
but don't delay
everyone else's work, okay?

484
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,980
Okay. We'll talk tomorrow.

485
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,500
- Okay.
- Okay.

486
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,630
Do a quick read-through.

487
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,500
Director Dai,

488
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,500
aren't you staying to lead the team?

489
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,260
Zhou Shui.

490
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,260
Where are you going?

491
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,390
Just walk around.

492
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:02,830
Zhou Shui.

493
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,260
Look.

494
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,020
Here's the campus.

495
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,500
Let's go have a look.

496
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,110
Forget it.

497
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,110
But I want to go.

498
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,430
How nice.

499
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,060
- The youth.
- We kind of

500
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,590
don't fit in here anymore.

501
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,460
But the campus hasn't changed much.

502
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,500
Look at that building.

503
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,460
It's a bit older now.

504
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,630
Look at that statue.

505
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,780
College days are the best.

506
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,980
Zhou Shui, look at those stairs.

507
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,630
Doesn't it remind you of something?

508
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,870
This is it.

509
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,950
This is the place.

510
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:55,980
This staircase.

511
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,870
I was standing

512
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,190
right up there.

513
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,190
Yes, in the middle.

514
00:22:59,190 --> 00:22:59,910
The center.

515
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:00,850
And on the sides

516
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,630
were Ren Zhuangzhuang
and the Four Kingkongs.

517
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,110
I remember it was a hot day.

518
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,630
We were all standing so straight

519
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,300
and waiting to talk about our dreams.

520
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,020
This should be the first scene.

521
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,020
High-angle shot.

522
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,430
You're in the center of the frame.

523
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,190
Backlit.

524
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,930
- Yeah,
- Backlit.

525
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:14,590
right?

526
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,500
Then,

527
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,230
we get a close-up shot
of your front teeth.

528
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,300
Then, the scene changes, and I'm there.

529
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,110
You're there.

530
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,060
Holding a water gun.

531
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,630
And up.

532
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,460
Your hair flows.

533
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,260
You looked so handsome that day,
like Takeshi Kaneshiro.

534
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,060
You looked like Maggie Cheung.

535
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,350
- Next scene.
- Next scene.

536
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,300
I'm completely soaked.

537
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:39,940
Yeah.

538
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,060
But laughing uncontrollably.

539
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,060
Laughing uncontrollably.

540
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,590
Then, the camera swings to you.

541
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,110
Me too.

542
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,540
You're also soaked

543
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,690
and laughing uncontrollably.

544
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,220
There's a reflection of a rainbow

545
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,390
on our laughing faces,

546
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,110
and we both look up at the rainbow.

547
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,350
The shot freezes on the rainbow.

548
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,500
Freeze.

549
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,110
What about the scene where we first met?

550
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,870
- Close-up.
- Close-up. Take the hammer.

551
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,020
Bingo.

552
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,260
- Lift the camera.
- Lift.

553
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,910
- Everyone is in shock.
- Shocked.

554
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:11,870
- Close-up.
- Right.

555
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,210
Turn around, and there's a door.

556
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:13,590
A door.

557
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,670
Okay. I'm going.

558
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,430
Bang!

559
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,350
Sorry.

560
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,110
I kicked the door.

561
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:22,730
Scene changes.

562
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:23,430
To both of us.

563
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,350
Two-shot.

564
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,460
One has a face mask on,

565
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,430
- and the other is holding a hammer.
- A hammer.

566
00:24:28,018 --> 00:24:29,494
- Chuck Berry.
- Chuck Berry.

567
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,220
Music.

568
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,430
Come on.

569
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,110
- You're silly.
- Come on.

570
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,190
Who are you?

571
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,390
This is the male dorm.

572
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:39,780
Yes.

573
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,460
Yes, we're sorry.

574
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,500
Sorry.

575
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:41,910
Leave.

576
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:42,780
Okay.

577
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,110
Sorry.

578
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,460
- We're sorry.
- Sorry.

579
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,060
Different warden.

580
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:46,700
Faster!

581
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,460
Sorry.

582
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,220
My goodness.

583
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,830
Different warden, but same attitude.

584
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:52,700
Why does every warden

585
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,460
have to be so fierce?

586
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,540
Don't you realize

587
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,980
that when we talk about our story,

588
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,190
love seems to come back a little?

589
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,540
This is the movie we should be making.

590
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,540
Right.

591
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:26,020
This is the movie we should make.

592
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,060
Now, the script has changed,

593
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,590
the crew team has changed,

594
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,830
and even the title.

595
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,630
I didn't want to argue with them,

596
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,830
but I honestly didn't know what to do.

597
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,780
I'm sorry, Daji.

598
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,110
I messed up.

599
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,020
Zhou Shui,

600
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,740
actually,

601
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,190
I insisted on making this film

602
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,260
to bring our love back.

603
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,700
So no matter what happened

604
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,390
or what Ms. Chao said to you,

605
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,870
I told you to bear with it.

606
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,260
I thought

607
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,740
if we just held on,

608
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,980
and the camera started rolling,

609
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,220
we could decide everything

610
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,190
as the directors.

611
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,780
But now,

612
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,700
just like you said,

613
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,260
the script and the title

614
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:30,950
have changed.

615
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,870
It's no longer our story

616
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,390
or our movie.

617
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,700
If you don't want to continue,

618
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,870
let's quit.

619
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,630
I'll leave with you.

620
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,630
I messed up.

621
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,670
Ms. Chao didn't tell you to leave.

622
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,300
You should stay and continue filming.

623
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,150
Look, you forgot again.

624
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,190
The most important thing
in a relationship is loyalty.

625
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:11,260
I won't let you down,
and you won't let me down.

626
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,500
If we're making it,
we're doing it together.

627
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,630
If not, we leave together.

628
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,670
But if we don't make it,
we'll have nothing.

629
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,910
Worst case, we go back to making ads.

630
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,430
Right?

631
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,460
Right?

632
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,780
Even if

633
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,540
we go back to that,

634
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,700
we'll still be the number one

635
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,190
"Scandalous Couple" there.

636
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,540
Starting over isn't a big deal.

637
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,300
Zhou Shui.

638
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:01,590
Well.

639
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,670
Since we've agreed,

640
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,430
I'll ask if she has time
to meet tomorrow.

641
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:10,980
Cut.

642
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,260
Sorry, sir.

643
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,110
Please move.

644
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,060
You're in the shot.

645
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:14,870
Sorry.

646
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:15,740
Thank you.

647
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,950
What are you shooting?

648
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:27,980
A short film?

649
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,910
Yes. We're making our own short film.

650
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,500
We're going to submit it to Beijing

651
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,460
for the coming script competition.

652
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,220
You're a promising man.

653
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,300
Good luck.

654
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,300
Thank you, sir.

655
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,540
Don't call me that.

656
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,430
I graduated from the film school.

657
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,590
I'm your senior.

658
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:44,500
Senior?

659
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,390
Are you making movies now too?

660
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,110
Sir, we're all set.

661
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,300
All right, let's start.

662
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:18,780
Come in.

663
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,950
Director Zhou, Director Dai.

664
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,390
Have you made a decision?

665
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,780
If you're not using our script,

666
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,430
we'll quit this production.

667
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,020
We don't need our names on it either.

668
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,020
And you, Director Zhou?

669
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,220
We'll hand everything over properly
before we leave.

670
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,350
We don't delay your production.

671
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,260
Impressive!

672
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,500
That's the spirit of young people.

673
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,430
No compromise. No surrender.

674
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,460
No fear of power.

675
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,700
Move forward together,
holding on to each other.

676
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,260
You two have truly impressed me.

677
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,540
Come and sit.

678
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,390
It's fine. Ms. Chao.

679
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,430
Come on. Have a seat.

680
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,590
I'm sorry.

681
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,390
I've been too busy lately.

682
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,060
I forgot to ask.

683
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,700
Have you been paid your director fees?

684
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:13,910
Well.

685
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:14,540
Not yet.

686
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,300
Right.

687
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,740
What's wrong with Biao?

688
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,590
Anyway, don't worry.

689
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,700
I'll make sure you get paid.

690
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:22,540
Besides,

691
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,460
I'll do my best

692
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,740
to keep your names in the credits.

693
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,300
To be honest,

694
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,540
your script

695
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,020
is pretty well-written.

696
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,190
It has warmth and emotion.

697
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,780
But it's too artistic.

698
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,540
It doesn't suit my style.

699
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,590
How about this?

700
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,460
I can introduce it

701
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,110
to other production companies

702
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:39,910
and send them

703
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,110
the script.

704
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,910
Have you booked your flights?

705
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,460
I can get you business class tickets.

706
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,670
It's all right, Ms. Chao.

707
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:49,350
We can afford that.

708
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,500
No.

709
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,150
I insist.

710
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,590
Let me show you my love.

711
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:56,670
Love?

712
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:57,870
For us?

713
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,780
Because both of you

714
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,670
remind me of my younger days.

715
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,430
They wanted me to change my script,

716
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,190
but I refused.

717
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,670
In the end, I quit.

718
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,300
Guess what?

719
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,190
The producer

720
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,300
spread words saying he'd blacklist me.

721
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,980
I couldn't get work for years.

722
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,110
Ms. Chao,

723
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,830
if we leave today,

724
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,910
will you blacklist us too?

725
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,150
Of course not.

726
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,630
I've been in your shoes.

727
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,190
I'm on your side.

728
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,350
What are you planning after going back?

729
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,300
We'll make ads.

730
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,060
Ads?

731
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:37,870
You're a film director now.

732
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,060
Thank you, Ms. Chao.

733
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,670
We should get going.

734
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,150
We haven't packed our things.

735
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,540
No rush.

736
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,780
Stay a little longer.

737
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,780
Let me make you coffee.

738
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,700
No thanks, Ms. Chao.

739
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:50,590
It's fine.

740
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,260
My coffee tastes really good.

741
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,590
Come. Sit down.

742
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,500
You know,

743
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:00,540
the first time I had coffee,

744
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,020
I was eighteen.

745
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,780
At that time,

746
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,670
my husband and I

747
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:10,430
just moved to the big city.

748
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:10,980
He said,

749
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,540
"We have to try real coffee."

750
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,700
And guess what?

751
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,110
It was so bitter.

752
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:17,980
He said

753
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,390
it was ten thousand times worse than

754
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,830
the grass jelly from our hometown.

755
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,540
Director Zhou.

756
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:26,830
Actually,

757
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,670
when I first saw you,

758
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,460
I thought you looked like my husband.

759
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,830
Director Dai,

760
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,630
I'm sure you know
what I'm talking about.

761
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,700
Is Director Zhou the most talented

762
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,220
director you know?

763
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,980
I think my husband is.

764
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,870
When he made his first movie,

765
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,230
he was only in his early twenties.

766
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,980
He almost won a big award.

767
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:57,060
He was a director,
and I was the scriptwriter.

768
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,220
We were the golden couple

769
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,910
in the industry back in the day.

770
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:01,590
Ms. Chao,

771
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,870
do you need us to follow up
on anything?

772
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,190
Let's not talk about work.

773
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,110
You're just like my husband.

774
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,700
You only care about work.

775
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,870
All he thought about was movies.

776
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,780
He knew nothing about people skills.

777
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,110
In the end,

778
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,740
he couldn't finish his movie.

779
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,670
He quit.

780
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,590
I remember he was thirty at that time.

781
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,020
Director Zhou,

782
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,950
you're thirty years old, aren't you?

783
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,700
See? It's destiny.

784
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,190
Anyway,

785
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,150
I finished the movie

786
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,910
after he left.

787
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,780
In fact, I only directed ten scenes.

788
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,780
But that didn't matter.

789
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,780
By the end of the year,

790
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,460
I won my very first award.

791
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,830
That was the start of my career.

792
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,980
What about your husband?

793
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:51,460
Him?

794
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,870
The last time I saw him
was two or three years ago.

795
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,110
I was at a night market with my friends.

796
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,910
He was running a stall,

797
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,390
selling grass jelly.

798
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,590
There was a long line of customers.

799
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,220
You know what?

800
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,180
The grass jelly he sold

801
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:10,430
required a complicated
and tedious process.

802
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,710
Chopping the grass jelly

803
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,790
into small pieces

804
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,180
and mixing it

805
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:19,180
with ingredients

806
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:19,830
and ice

807
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:20,980
before serving.

808
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,790
He was alone. No helpers.

809
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,500
He was as stubborn as he used to be.

810
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,500
But his life

811
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,830
had nothing to do with movies anymore.

812
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,020
He was selling the thing

813
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,980
he hated most.

814
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,390
I didn't go up.

815
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,660
I asked a friend to buy me a cup of it.

816
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,390
I took a sip, and I cried.

817
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,020
I thought

818
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:49,980
that was

819
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,140
the taste of youth.

820
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,430
Try the coffee.

821
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,540
It's good.

822
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,660
Ethiopia.

823
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,500
Gesha with the red label
and in small batches.

824
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,500
Try it.

825
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,390
Remember this taste.

826
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,390
This isn't the taste of youth.

827
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,660
It's the taste of maturity.

828
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,430
The taste of success.

829
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:43,750
Let's leave, Zhou Shui.

830
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,750
Ms. Chao,

831
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,790
I want to make this film.

832
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,580
I can't give up.

833
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:25,580
Zhou Shui,

834
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,390
are you sure?

835
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,660
Are you sure you want to do this?

836
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,830
Let's do it together.

837
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,500
I can't believe he actually did that!

838
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,870
That's worse than cheating.

839
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,620
Why didn't you punch him on the spot?

840
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,870
I thought the same thing at first.

841
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,100
But I don't think you were wrong.

842
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,660
She was the one
who chose movies over marriage.

843
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,760
She quit the movie herself.

844
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,710
She was the one
who pushed you to this situation.

845
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,500
She didn't mean to.

846
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:42,870
Everything she did

847
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,500
was to keep us together.

848
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,350
Because of my obsession,

849
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,460
he gave up so many things.

850
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:52,980
The ad was canceled,

851
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:54,620
the company was shut down,

852
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,350
and we gave up
on the house and the marriage.

853
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:59,980
He had no turning back.

854
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,460
I used to think that once we had
a house and money,

855
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:04,870
got married, and settled down,
we were together.

856
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,870
But no.

857
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,230
You can get divorced,
a family can fall apart,

858
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,560
a house can be abandoned,

859
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,580
and money can be lost.

860
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,660
But love doesn't.

861
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,870
Love can't be objectified.

862
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,910
And more than that,

863
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,870
being a director is his dream.

864
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,910
He's waited for ten years.

865
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,710
He was only one step away.

866
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,020
At that moment,

867
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,100
"Give up"

868
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,540
was the hardest words to say.

869
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:49,950
Actually, it was my fault.

870
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:53,350
And I've been wrong for a long time.

871
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,060
Even without that movie,

872
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,140
I'm no longer the person
she fell in love with.

873
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:39,430
Let's do it.

874
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:41,180
