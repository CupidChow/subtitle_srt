3
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,950
(Summer 2024, Chongqing)

4
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,020
Once you arrive at there,

5
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,020
follow the elders' advice.

6
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,350
Okay, Mom.

7
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,230
Get along with your colleagues.

8
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:01,870
Zihao.

9
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,590
Listen.

10
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,350
It's not easy
to get into this organization.

11
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,350
Got it?

12
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,890
The position is officially established.

13
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,980
You have to work hard
and cherish this chance.

14
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,750
Look at the time.

15
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,980
Why are you still asleep?

16
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,190
You have no vitality
even though you're young.

17
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,470
How could you be a model?

18
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,630
I quit that long ago.

19
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,100
What else can you do, then?

20
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,540
Idle away at home all day?

21
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,420
Listen.

22
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,700
I'm not coming back for dinner.

23
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,100
What will I eat, then?

24
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,190
Go and find your father.

25
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,190
Baby, do you miss me?

26
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,580
I miss you.

27
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,190
It's been so long since we met.
I miss you.

28
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,860
Mom has left the house. What will I eat?

29
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:49,860
I'm not hungry.

30
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,470
Order a food delivery or something.

31
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,350
Look.

32
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,350
Your daily task

33
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,310
is to check all of these criteria.

34
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,030
Tick the box if you think it fits.

35
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,190
Here.

36
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,190
For example, this fire hydrant.

37
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,700
- That?
- Over there.

38
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,420
That's right.

39
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,190
Do a fire inspection once
in the morning.

40
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,260
Attend meetings
and study in the afternoon.

41
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,230
Once you're back,

42
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,470
do another fire inspection.

43
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,820
Our park closes at 4:30 P.M.

44
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,380
You'll get off work at 4:30 P.M.

45
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,470
It's that simple?

46
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,190
I just need to do two fire inspections

47
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,950
and attend a meeting once per day?

48
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,050
There are plenty of steps.

49
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,190
You'll understand
how tough it is soon enough.

50
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,820
I have to experience that myself.

51
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,630
Wait, madam.

52
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,750
Are there any extra tasks

53
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,860
that you can assign to me?

54
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,910
You see, I studied

55
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,910
Information Engineering in university.

56
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,100
So what?

57
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,860
I studied Finance
in university, you know?

58
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,060
Youngsters like you
need to take it one step at a time.

59
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,420
Don't think
that the tasks here are simple.

60
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,700
The park is a historical
and scenic site.

61
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,910
Fire prevention work is vital.

62
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,630
You have to inspect
each and every detail.

63
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,790
You have to be stringent.

64
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,890
If anything goes wrong,
it'll turn into a disaster.

65
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,030
Once you accomplish the basic tasks,

66
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,700
you can change the exhibition posters,

67
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,910
guide the tourists,

68
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,140
or do some work within your ability.

69
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,020
(Su Zihao: My dream job!)

70
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,420
(Tong Leyi: My dream life!)

71
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,750
What are you doing?

72
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,550
Have you eaten?

73
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:33,100
(2010 Minor Chinese New Year, Beijing)

74
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,630
Hello, Dad?

75
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,020
Boy.

76
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,670
The smog in Beijing looks really severe.

77
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,820
Do you wear a mask when you go out?

78
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,510
I do.

79
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,580
How have you been lately?

80
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,110
How's your job coming along?

81
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,190
Do you have enough money to spend?

82
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,700
It's pretty good.

83
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,020
Everything's going well.

84
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,700
You don't tell me
even when you don't have enough anyway.

85
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,700
How's your girlfriend doing?

86
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,140
Has she been doing well?

87
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,190
She went back to her hometown
for a few days.

88
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,540
It's Chinese New Year after all.

89
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,020
I talked to her on the phone last time.

90
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,870
I think she's a good girl.

91
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,780
You have to cherish her.

92
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,200
Are you coming back
for Chinese New Year?

93
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,990
I won't be going back this year.

94
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,140
I'll remain in Beijing.

95
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,430
I'll spend the holiday here.
I'm busy with work.

96
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,700
You haven't celebrated it
with us for a few years.

97
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,820
Your mother misses you.

98
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,190
The main thing is,

99
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,630
Daji might come back in a few days.

100
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,750
I want to wait here for her.

101
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,220
How many people are staying here?
You guys are something else.

102
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,580
Hurry and show yourself.

103
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,140
Is anyone there? Come out.

104
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,870
Who are you?

105
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,820
I'm your landlord.

106
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,340
Who's that?

107
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,140
What do you do?

108
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:58,820
Our landlord?

109
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,550
I work in a gym.

110
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,070
What did you two do for a living?

111
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,460
Speak!

112
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,780
Why are you shouting at us?

113
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,900
We're businessmen.

114
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,310
I have a decent job.

115
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,380
And you. Where do you work?

116
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,510
I sell wontons downstairs.

117
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:14,900
What?

118
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,750
My goodness.

119
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,780
Who are you?

120
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,870
- Who are you?
- He's...

121
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,070
He's a film director.

122
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,260
It's with one living-room
and three bedroom.

123
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,020
What's with all the partitions?

124
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,460
Do you know it's unsafe?

125
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,430
Get out of my way.

126
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,550
How is there one more person?

127
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,460
It's not safe at all.

128
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,460
Who are you?

129
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,870
Don't just...

130
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,190
She said she's our landlord.

131
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,510
Landlord?

132
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,260
Isn't Scum our landlord?

133
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,220
I don't know.

134
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,510
Who's Scum?

135
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,700
I don't know him.

136
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,190
I left this unit to a property agent.

137
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,900
How did another person in charge of it?

138
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,140
Besides,

139
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,340
you guys can live here,

140
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,430
but can you guys take care of the place?

141
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,140
Don't touch it!

142
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,990
What's with all this?

143
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,820
I'm warning you! Don't touch my stuff!

144
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,110
What do you mean? Get out!

145
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,070
Say that again?

146
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,020
You asked me to get out?

147
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,820
- So what?
- This is my unit!

148
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,630
Listen.

149
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,900
Don't try to intimidate me.

150
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,690
I was just released
from the police station.

151
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,700
The police station, huh?
You're something else.

152
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,110
You win, okay?

153
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,580
Listen.

154
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,900
You guys better move out
as soon as possible,

155
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,750
you hear me?

156
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,630
If not, I'll teach you a lesson.

157
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,260
My goodness.

158
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,050
Get out of my way.

159
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,070
I finally got time to check out.

160
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,190
Listen up.

161
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:21,990
You have three days.

162
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,750
All of you must move out.

163
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,990
If not, I'll call the cops.

164
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,440
No one will get to stay here.

165
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,460
I would have no idea
had she not called me.

166
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,820
This is so infuriating.

167
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,100
What the heck was that?

168
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,500
Jingshu, let's go inside.

169
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:14,740
(Flipped, Pulp Fiction)

170
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,740
What about this? Tomorrow...

171
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,150
I'll go and check out
a few places tomorrow.

172
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,950
I'll see if there are
any suitable units nearby.

173
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,030
It's not a big deal.

174
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,340
I'll deal with it.

175
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,340
You can have the money back.

176
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,950
Why are you giving it back?

177
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:19,860
Keep it for yourself.

178
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,860
To pay your school fees.

179
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,340
It's no longer of use to me.

180
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,150
Thank you.

181
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,220
Hey. What do you mean by this?

182
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,220
Shen Jingshu,

183
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,030
we've received a report

184
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,070
that you were working
as a shill of wedding.

185
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,270
After our discussion,

186
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,700
we've decided

00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,620
to expel you.

188
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,390
This is the official notice.

(Name: Shen Jingshu)

191
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,150
I'm returning to my hometown.

192
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,550
If so,

193
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,430
what about us?

194
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,100
What should we do

195
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,910
about our relationship?

196
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:09,060
(Chunzhili, Unit No. 4)

197

The stall is gone.

198
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,580
Old Chives has moved out as well.

199
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,270
Yeah.

200
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,390
We can't even buy a pancake now.

201
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,190
Where do you plan to go?

202
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,340
I'm heading to the West Station. You?

203
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,460
The northern suburbs
by a long-distance bus.

204
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,820
Guess we have to part ways here.

205
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:36,860
Say,

206
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,820
how many years have we been in Beijing?

207
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,670
Three or four years. I can't remember.

208
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,190
We've been here for many years.

209
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,430
What have we obtained?

210
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,340
100 Bitcoin.

211
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,030
The price even fell today.

212
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,790
How much?

213
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,070
It's only worth 0.3 USD.

214
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,550
It's just a little over two yuan?

215
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:07,820
Buddy, see you.

216
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,270
See you.

(Chunzhili)

218
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,430
You guys don't need to see me off.

219
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,270
Take care.

220
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,950
You guys as well.

221
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,100
Thank you, Dumbbell.

222
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,030
Give it to me.

223
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,790
Give it to me.

224

Dumbbell.

225
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,910
Give it to me.

226

229
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,150
That's not it.

230

In Beijing, we...

231
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,910
In the future, we...

232
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,790
What are you trying to say?

233
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,500
You see,

234
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,500
can you please don't leave?

235
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,270
I don't want you to leave.

236
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,860
I like you.

237
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,950
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

before Chinese New Year.

If not, she'll call the cops.

258

Look.

00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,030
(Leave before Chinese New Year!
If not, I'll call the cops!)

260
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,190
Should we move out?

261
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,220
She wants us to move out, fine.

262
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,430
But according to our rules,

263
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,910
we shall leave after having a drink.

the rules?

266

You don't need to know.
It's a promise.

267
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,390
Wait, are you serious?

268
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,430
Will Jingshu come back
after I finish it?

269
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,220
Come!

271

272
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,150
Listen.

00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,220
(Ezhou)
As an intern,

274
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,660
(Ezhou)
you should make do

275
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,910
with the dormitory for now.

276
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,390
Once you become an official employee,

277
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,630
I'll buy you a new house.

278
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,300
Okay?

279
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:07,980
It's fine.

280
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,910
This place looks nice.
It's pretty quiet.

Let's go and check it out.

282
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:16,950
Look at the place.

283
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,060
Come inside.

284
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,190
It's pretty good.

285

This is the kitchen.

286

This is your room.

287
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,390
This is the living room.

288
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,390
It's not bad, right?

289
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,300
Hello.

290
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,460
Are you Jing?

291
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,110
Yeah.

292
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,910
She's Mr. Chen's daughter.
You remember her?

293
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:36,630
Hello.

294
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,910
This is my daughter, Daji.

295
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:38,670
I'm Daji.

296
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,870
Hello.

297
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,390
You two were classmates
and good friends in the past.

298
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,700
Now, you two are colleagues.

299
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,350
You must look after each other, okay?

300
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,430
- Okay.
- Okay.

301
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,630
Look at Jing.

302
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,060
She's studying all the time.

303
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,950
Learn from her,

304
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:51,540
you hear me?

305
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,590
Give me your luggage.

306
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,300
Come.

307
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,020
Let me help you.

308
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,590
It's fine. You guys can have a chat.

309
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:56,630
Have a chat.

310
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,350
I'll do it.

311
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,390
Hello.

312
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,110
What book are you reading?

313
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,780
"How to Win Friends
and Influence People."

314
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,670
Hello.

315
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,460
I'm the newcomer.

316
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,540
My name is Dai Daji.

317
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,670
From now on, we're colleagues.

318
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,950
Please guide me in the future.

319
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,150
Hello, Mr. Liu.

320
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,190
Enough. You can drop the act.

321
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,260
It's 6 P.M.

322
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,630
You guys may leave now.

323
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,670
Mr. Liu.

324
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,700
Goodbye.

325
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,350
Mr. Liu.

326
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,060
Hello.

327
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,110
I'm the newcomer.

328
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,630
Today's my first day.

329
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,870
I just want to ask...

330
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:12,740
Goodbye, Mr. Liu.

331
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,150
Okay.

332
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,980
I don't know what to do

333
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,700
during work hours.

334
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,460
You...

335
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,110
You're already doing a good job.

336
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,260
What about this?

337
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,950
We can discuss this tomorrow.

338
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:24,780
Work time is over.

339
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,430
Okay?

340
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,670
Close the windows.

341
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:27,220
Okay.

342
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:27,670
Alright.

343
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,830
Okay. Goodbye, Mr. Liu.

344
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,500
Goodbye.

345
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,460
Jing.

346
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,590
Did you cook dinner, Jing?

347
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,670
Daji, why are you back?

348
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,980
I was wondering if
I should buy you a meal.

349
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:03,700
Do you...

350
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,460
Hello.

351
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,060
This is?

352
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,980
This is Mr. He
from the Municipal Procuratorate.

353
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,350
Hi, Mr. He.

354
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,260
Daji just returned from Beijing.

355
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:17,060
I'm sure you have plenty
of classmates to meet.

356
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,910
I met them last week.

357
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,220
So, are you not going out tonight?

358
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:23,670
I am.

359
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,830
Okay. So...

360
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,740
You can come back
as late as you want.

361
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,540
Alright. No problem.

362
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:48,980
Mr. Liu, what's wrong?

363
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,060
I told you to write
the promotional video proposal.

364
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,670
What have you done?

365
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,980
Mr. Liu, it's like this.

366
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,910
I've drawn the storyboard
for this proposal.

367
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,300
This way, the videographer

368
00:20:59,300 --> 00:20:59,980
will know

369
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,220
what to shoot for each scene.

370
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,220
You didn't even include
the most important thing

371
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,430
we need in the script.

372
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,350
You're not even giving
a single shot to the bureau chief?

373
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,220
Dai Daji.

374
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,060
Don't think
that you know everything just because

375
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,260
you spent two years in Beijing.

376
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,670
This isn't Beijing.

377
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,980
Mr. Liu, you dropped your pen.

378
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,500
It's not mine.

379
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,910
My pen is on the table.

380
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,220
Fine.

381
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:30,950
I...

382
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,390
Mr. Liu.

383
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,980
You're so inflexible.

384
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,460
Listen.

385
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:43,020
Regarding our official staff quota,

386
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,740
if you keep this up,

387
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,840
you won't be able to get it.

388
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,530
Try it if you don't believe me.

389
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:08,780
Dumbbell.

390
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,150
Dumbbell?

391
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,830
She has already moved out.

392
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,870
The house is empty.

393
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,060
Zhou Shui, do you think
time can be reversed?

394
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,540
Guys, here comes the big stuff!

395
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,060
What is that?

396
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,300
(I was reminded)

397
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,300
(of the time
when we started living here.)

398
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,950
(There was a song called
"Poor But Happy.")

399
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,740
(Back then,)

400
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,910
(we were poor but happy.)

401
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,700
(Back then,)

402
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:01,160
(I thought I would
keep her company forever.)

403
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:05,780
(I never expected us
to part ways just like that.)

404
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,060
Who's there?

405
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,300
Who's there?

406
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,260
Who's there?

407
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,350
Jingshu?

408
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,260
Jingshu!

409
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,500
Jingshu!

410
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,700
Jingshu, don't leave me.

411
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,350
Jingshu.

412
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,910
Jingshu, don't leave me.

413
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,910
So what if you got expelled?

414
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,360
Don't be afraid. There's nothing
to fear when I'm here.

415
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,350
Jingshu, I promise you.

416
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,700
As long as you're willing to stay,

417
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,350
our lives will definitely
get better and better.

418
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:27,980
Trust me.

419
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,670
I'll provide you with a better life

420
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,190
even if I have to go against the world.

421
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,260
Believe me.

422
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,260
Jingshu, can you believe me?

423
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,630
I'm not leaving.

424
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,700
I'm not leaving.

425
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,260
What are you doing?

426
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,460
I'm not leaving.

427
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,020
Jingshu, is it really you?

428
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,110
I'm not dreaming, aren't I?

429
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,020
You must be a fool.

430
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,590
Actually, I already
bought the train ticket.

431
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,830
But when I was waiting for the train,

432
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,950
I suddenly remember
that I might not have a chance

433
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,460
to leave my hometown again
once I return.

434
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,670
I've spent years in Beijing,

435
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,060
yet I haven't achieved anything.

436
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,390
I'm unsatisfied.

437
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,540
I've already experienced a larger world.

438
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,350
I've been in Beijing.

439
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,220
My hometown is now

440
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,260
too small for me.

441
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,150
So, you didn't stay

442
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,430
because of

443
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:12,980
me, huh?

444
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,670
What did you say?

445
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,540
Nothing.

446
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:19,430
Jingshu.

447
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,950
We'll remain in Beijing in the future.

448
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,390
We won't go anywhere.

449
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,190
Dummy.

450
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:45,950
Are you not leaving with us?

451
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,780
The new unit we rented
is quite far away.

452
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,780
But it's pretty spacious.

453
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,020
You should come with us.

454
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,590
Yeah.

455
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,910
Forget it.

456
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,540
I have my own things to do.

457
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,700
The landlord will claim her unit soon.

458
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,630
What's your plan next?

459
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,020
I'll think of a way.

460
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,500
There's always a way.

461
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,830
Take care.

462
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,670
Don't drink again, okay?

463
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,500
Dumbbell. Jingshu.

464
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,020
Happy Chinese New Year.

465
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,220
Happy Chinese New Year.

466
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:43,950
Happy Chinese New Year.

467
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,060
Go now.

468
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:15,950
Old classmates?

469
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,540
When they got together,

470
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,980
none of us knew

471
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,670
all these years.

472
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,870
What?

473
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,980
Fine. Don't arrange for anything.

474
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,060
By then, we'll make him...

475
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:29,090
Let's drink.

476
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:29,910
Sorry for being late.

477
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:30,780
Daji.

478
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,020
- Come. You can sit over here.
- Waiter.

479
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,300
Long, you've gained weight.

480
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,300
Here comes our movie director.

481
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,300
That's not true.

482
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,870
Daji,

483
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,670
I heard that you're working
as a TV show director

484
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,430
for a TV station, right?

485
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,220
Yeah!

486
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,980
Your mother told my mother about it.

487
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,350
My mother told her mother about it.

488
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,910
All of our mothers knew that.

489
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:51,670
Yeah.

490
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,190
No. She was spouting nonsense.

491
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,220
How could I be a director
in a TV station?

492
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,980
Do we look like we believe you?

493
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,910
Impossible.

494
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,260
She was just bragging.

495
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,300
Here. I was late.

496
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,630
I just came back not long ago.

497
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,950
Let me offer you guys a toast.

498
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,390
- Come.
- Let's have a toast.

499
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,700
Long time no see.

500
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,390
Here.

501
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,870
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

502
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,260
You're still as beautiful as always.

503
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,740
Daji, your sweater looks really nice.

504
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,740
Bought it in Beijing?

505
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,780
Yeah.

506
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,950
Do you guys remember Fan Yixuan?

507
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:21,780
You mean her?

508
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,540
Yeah.

509
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,740
She was sitting in the last row

510
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,390
right beside the windows.

511
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,980
Enough. Stop talking about her.

512
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,630
Do you know who her boyfriend

513
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:30,350
is?

514
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,060
Who?

515
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,350
I know that.

516
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,460
The son of the director
of the tax bureau.

517
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,010
His whole family got official positions.

518
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:36,390
Listen.

519
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,150
Way better than us.

520
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,430
He and his family
have official positions

521
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,950
in the tax bureau.

522
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,540
All three of them?

523
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,850
He's not as outstanding as Daji.

524
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:46,460
You flatter me.

525
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,020
Daji'll find one better than him.

526
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:48,700
Am I right?

527
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,110
Do you have a boyfriend now?

528
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,590
I had one, but we already broke up.

529
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,220
It's fine.

530
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,740
I'll recommend some guys to you.

531
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,780
I know many good men...

532
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,780
I'm good. No need.

533
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:58,780
Daji.

534
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,500
Why don't you consider me?

535
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,220
Don't you agree?

536
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,350
You're so thick-skinned.

537
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,540
You're not my type.

538
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,300
You're not my cup of tea.

539
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,460
Drink up.

540
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,430
When it comes to finding partners,

541
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:12,630
there are three types.

542
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:13,780
The first type

543
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,890
is the one who has an official position.

544
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,450
This type of partner is very reliable.

545
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,540
They lead a secure life
for the rest of their lives.

546
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,980
I'm sure both parties
have their own criteria.

547
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,220
Both parties have to
have official positions, right?

548
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:25,590
Yes.

549
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,870
Don't be impatient.

550
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:27,980
There's the second type.

551
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:30,980
They're doctors, lawyers,
or people with similar occupations.

552
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,350
If you're with them,
you got nothing to worry about.

553
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,430
You'll live a good life.

554
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:34,670
Right?

555
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:37,910
Under such circumstances,
one of them has to quit their job.

556
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,910
Both parties are busy.

557
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,060
Who'll look after the family?

558
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,630
It's tough raising a child nowadays.

559
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,500
Yeah. It's difficult.

560
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,150
There's the third type.

561
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,350
Those who work for a large company.

562
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,060
Agree?

563
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:49,910
Yeah.

564
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,950
They have space to grow and develop.

565
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,190
Are you referring to yourself?

566
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,870
How many houses have you bought?

567
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:57,670
Cui.

568
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:59,350
What's the worst type of partner, then?

569
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,300
The worst type of partner

570
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,590
is the type who cannot give you anything
and doesn't have prospects.

571
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:05,630
Don't you agree?

572
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:08,670
Your cup is filled.

573
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,540
You should drink.

574
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,420
(Vest, Old Chives, Dumbbell)

575
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:30,086
(Zhou Shui, Daji)

576
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,060
(Zhou Shui, Daji)

577
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,910
(Old Chives made 100 dumplings
for us before he left.)

578
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:50,950
(I was thinking)

579
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,430
(about what I should do)

580
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,110
(if Daji doesn't return)

581
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,630
(after I finish all of them.)

582
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,060
It's Chinese New Year!
Can't you just stop?

583
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:44,950
I'll leave after that!

584
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:13,670
Don't enter people's room
without permission, okay?

585
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,220
It's quite a warm place.

586
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,500
Why are you drinking so much?

587
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:27,870
I don't know.

588
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,630
You were just locked up
for over ten days

589
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,210
and had broken up with your girlfriend.

590
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,060
Compared to me,

591
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,590
your experience is nothing.

592
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,670
Look at me.

593
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,110
Through my own effort,

594
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,430
I've gotten myself out of it.

595
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,700
What?

596
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,430
It's a long story.

597
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,670
Look at me. Did you notice any changes?

598
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:52,830
Nope.

599
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,020
Be a good boy.

600
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,980
I'm going to get married.

601
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,220
To who?

602
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,390
With someone

603
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,180
who's willing to resolve my issues.

604
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,710
Why exactly are you here?

605
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:15,580
I missed you.

606
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,430
I'm afraid

607
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,970
that there will be fewer opportunities
for us to meet in the future.

608
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,660
It's just a breakup.
Do you need to be this dejected?

609
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,350
You know nothing about me.

610
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:47,980
I'll drink with you.

611
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,870
Tell me. What's the drinking rule?

612
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,830
According to our rule,

613
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,910
if there's a breakup,
you have to finish a bottle in one go.

614
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,390
Brat,

615
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,060
are you a dummy?

616
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,020
How is that possible?

617
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,950
In one go?

618
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,870
That's impossible.

619
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,500
Who could drink
the entire bottle in one go?

620
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,830
Have you lost your mind?

621
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,750
Are you crazy?

622
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,390
Stop acting tough.

623
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,750
You might end up in the hospital.

624
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,910
Are you dumb? Stop drinking.

625
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,180
I told you already. There's no way.

626
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,020
Are you an idiot? Stop drinking.

627
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,350
What do you know?

628
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,100
I'm afraid that we have
to break up for real

629
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,060
if I do finish it!

630
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,580
If so, it's really over!

631
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:07,310
I have to help you get over her.

632
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,180
I'll help you out!

633
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,540
You wanted to drink, right?

634
00:36:13,553 --> 00:36:16,430
(Dramatic Effect, Please Do Not Imitate)

635
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,020
You said you wanted to break up, right?

636
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:19,980
Reverb!

637
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,430
Do you want to move on or not?

638
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,580
Happy Chinese New Year.

639
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,710
Mom, Be careful.

640
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:14,830
Okay.

641
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,580
Fireworks.

642
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,500
It looks so pretty.

643
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,060
That was a huge one. It was amazing.

644
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:23,790
Happy Chinese New Year.

645
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,230
Happy Chinese New Year, Dai Daji!

646
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,140
Let's remain in Beijing.

647
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:22,540
(Calling from Ezhou)

648
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:53,600
I don't want to celebrate
Chinese New Year alone.

649
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:57,870
Ten,

650
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,350
nine,

651
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,830
eight,

652
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,390
seven...

653
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,060
Daji!

654
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,100
Daji!

655
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:07,620
- Hurry!
- six,

656
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:10,430
five...

657
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,140
Don't answer it.

658
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:34,830
Hello?

659
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:37,980
three,

660
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,620
two,

661
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:41,870
one!

662
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,100
Happy Chinese New Year!

663
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,830
May you have a prosperous year.

665
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,710
Happy Chinese New Year!

Happy Chinese New Year!

667
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,230
Happy Chinese New Year.

668
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,020
