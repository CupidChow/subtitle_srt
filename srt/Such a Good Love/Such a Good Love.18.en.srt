00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,220
=Episode 18=

3
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,840
(Autumn 2024, Chongqing)
Sorry for the wait. Here's some ice jelly.

4
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

5
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,110
May we have the menu?

6
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,040
We don't have one.

7
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,840
The owner decides
what's on the menu each day.

8
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,990
The owner seems like
quite the character.

9
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,530
Yes.

10
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,200
Zhou!

11
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,860
Hotpot for three!

12
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,150
Got it! Coming right up!

13
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,280
Your food will be ready soon.

14
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,440
Make yourselves comfortable.

15
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,740
Go ahead.

16
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,320
What?

17
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,200
Order up!

18
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,700
All right. Got it.

19
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,570
Calm down.

20
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,030
I'm heading back now.

21
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,700
I'm hanging up.

22
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,240
What's wrong?

23
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,740
Something came up on set.

24
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,700
I need to handle it.

25
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,740
At least have one bite before you leave.

26
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,320
Just try it.

27
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,280
We waited so long.

28
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,450
You'll regret leaving now.

29
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,110
Ms. Dai...

30
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,400
I can't. I really have to go.

31
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,610
Maybe I'm just not meant

32
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,990
to enjoy the hotpot here.

33
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,160
- But... It'll be quick.
- Hotpot coming through!

34
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:37,800
The food's here!

35
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,760
You guys enjoy the food.

36
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:38,960
Here.

37
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,610
Next time.

38
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,720
- Um...
- Don't go!

39
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:41,990
Order up!

40
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,490
Wait!

41
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,200
Ms. Dai!

42
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,900
Don't go!

43
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,070
Are you all right?

44
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,276
- I'm so sorry...
- It's fine.

45
00:02:49,276 --> 00:02:50,280
Are you okay?

46
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,320
I'm fine.

47
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,120
I can't believe she left!

48
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,200
If she had just turned her head,
she would've seen him!

49
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,080
Why couldn't she turn around
for just one second?

50
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,320
We were one step away.
And now it's another missed chance.

51
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,450
Try calling her later.

52
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,240
Can you get her to come back?

53
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,360
Are you guys eating or not?
If not, give the table to someone else.

54
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,570
Order up!

55
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,990
Here's your chicken feet.

56
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,780
Thanks.

57
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,320
Thanks.

58
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,200
Enjoy.

59
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,200
How's the taste?

60
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,150
Two bowls of ice jelly on the house!

61
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,000
Rice eels.

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,490
- No thanks.
- We don't eat rice eels.

63
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,570
No rice eels?

64
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,360
You can't have hotpot without rice eels.

65
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,680
We don't want it.

66
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,950
- They don't taste good.
- How does someone who loves film that much

67
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,740
end up owning a hotpot restaurant?

68
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:17,860
All right.

69
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,030
Give it a try.

70
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,490
Enjoy.

71
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,740
Can we get two more dishes?

72
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,800
Here are your ice jellies.

73
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,400
Still not enough for you four?

74
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,740
I prep a limited amount each day.

75
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,650
If you eat more,
there won't be enough for others.

76
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,820
If it's good, come back next time.

77
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,780
- All right.
- All right?

78
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,800
What do you want to add?

79
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,780
This.

80
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,530
This?

81
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,400
Excuse me.

82
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,450
We're happy

83
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,360
you're eating here,
and filming is fine too,

84
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,070
but can you not

85
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,360
post the video online?

86
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,150
Please?

87
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,650
I'm promoting your place!

88
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,860
No need.

89
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,280
We run a small restaurant
and I'm the only one in the kitchen.

90
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,320
I can't handle too many customers.

91
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,400
He does act like a hotpot owner now.

92
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,450
He does.

93
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,450
- It suits him.
- This is just a small restaurant.

94
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,900
I do fine on my own.

95
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,530
Enjoy your meal.

96
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,570
What do you want to watch
during Golden Week?

97
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,450
Anything's fine.

98
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,900
Aren't all the Golden Week movies
funded by Huanteng Films?

99
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,360
All thanks to my boss.

100
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:22,070
She's one of the top producers
in the country now.

101
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,320
I heard your boss

102
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,650
used to date a director?

103
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,070
He doesn't direct anymore.

104
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,360
He runs a hotpot restaurant now!

105
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,860
Ice jelly coming through!

106
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,450
Really?

107
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,900
Do you think he heard us?

108
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
Ice jelly for you.

109
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,490
Thank you.

110
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,650
I'm sure he did.

111
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,610
Juan.

112
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,920
I have something nice for you too.

113
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,760
- Leftover ice jelly ingredients.
- What is it?

114
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,080
- Saved you a piece.
- Watermelon.

115
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,820
Come on. Let's eat.

116
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,650
Enjoy.

117
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,570
Enjoy.

118
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,360
Enjoy.

119
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,360
Okay.

120
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,650
We finally get to relax.

121
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,780
Smells amazing!

122
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,780
Let me try this.

123
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,700
Try it.

124
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,530
How is it?

125
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,280
It's delicious.

126
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,900
Can I be honest with you?

127
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,450
You're a better cook than a director.

128
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,720
If someone said that to me before,
I would've punched them.

129
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,530
And now?

130
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,280
Now I think you're right.

131
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,700
This is really good!

132
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,320
This is sweet. Try it.

133
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,240
See that?

134
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,490
Only couples eat

135
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,110
from the same watermelon

136
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,360
with the same spoon.

137
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,700
I don't think it's a big deal.

138
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,070
Good friends do that too.

139
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,530
It's not just a couple thing.

140
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,820
You and I wouldn't do it though.

141
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,860
You think that young lady
selling ice jelly

142
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,650
is his wife?

143
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,450
She is the boss.

144
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,320
But I don't think she and Zhou Shui
have anything going on.

145
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,450
My woman's intuition says

146
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,280
they definitely do.

147
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,570
My guy instinct says

148
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,900
they don't.

149
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,700
Want to bet on it?

150
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,570
You're on!

151
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,280
I wonder
if Sansan finished his homework.

152
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,110
He probably did.

153
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:34,860
Look at the time.

154
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,240
I'm sure he's watching TV now.

155
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,450
Sansan.

156
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,070
Mr. Pan.

157
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,740
Mr. Pan.

158
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,320
You're back.

159
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,070
We're back.

160
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,280
- Sansan.
- Hurry up!

161
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,680
Come here.

162
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,880
- Come here.
- Time to go home.

163
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,120
Okay.

164
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,030
Did he behave?

165
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:06,760
He was a good boy.

166
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,320
- There's a boy.
- Just leave him with me

167
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,650
whenever you need.

168
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:10,320
Mr. Pan

169
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,360
- We got some rice eels.
- What's that you got there?

170
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:12,760
Take them.

171
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,680
Oh, you shouldn't have!

172
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,200
- I can't accept this.
- Just take them.

173
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,880
Take it.

174
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,400
Okay. Thanks.

175
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,530
Thank you.

176
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,490
Thanks, Mr. Pan.

177
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,700
Don't mention it.

178
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,650
Come on, Sansan.

179
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,240
Did you have fun today?

180
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,150
A lot of fun!

181
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,490
Be careful.

182
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,240
I...

183
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,900
I can't believe he already has a son.

184
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,490
They seemed like a happy family.

185
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:43,820
Let's go.

186
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,990
I'm sweating.

187
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,570
I'm heading home.
See you at three tomorrow.

188
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:53,840
Got it.

189
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,920
Go on. Don't stay up late.

190
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,900
All right. Get some rest.

191
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,490
Sansan.

192
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,280
Say bye-bye.

193
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:57,860
Bye-bye!

194
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,440
Sleep early.

195
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,860
- I'm leaving.
- All right.

196
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,740
Get going.

197
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,070
See you tomorrow.

198
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,780
Come on. Let's head inside.

199
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,650
Bye.

200
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,360
Think you could convince Ms. Dai
to come back for hotpot tomorrow?

201
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,030
Although, Ms. Dai has Mr. Zhang now.

202
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,990
Mr. Zhou has a family too.

203
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,490
Maybe we shouldn't let them meet?

204
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,700
What do you think?

205
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,150
Why aren't you saying anything?

206
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,450
What's wrong?

207
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,450
Nothing.

208
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,570
Just feeling emo.

209
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,650
Emo?

210
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,740
You? Depressed?

211
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,820
I'll get you a popsicle.

212
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,070
Something sweet will fix it.

213
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,400
How much is this?

214
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:01,610
Two yuan.

215
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,240
All right.

216
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,820
Welcome to Reverb's livestream!

217
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,240
How are my mama friends doing?

218
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,070
First, I've got some exciting news

219
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:09,780
to share.

220
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,070
I'm five months and five days pregnant

221
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,860
with my third baby!

222
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,820
Do we have any new mothers?

223
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,570
Isn't that Reverb?

224
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,450
- Comment 1 if you are!
- I think so.

225
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,650
Owner,

226
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,150
she's that popular streamer now, right?

227
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,530
Yes, she's very popular.

228
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,780
She sells mom-and-baby stuff.

229
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,700
Our kid's formula

230
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,950
and stroller

231
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:29,950
all came from her.

232
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,570
A mom blogger.

233
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,280
Reverb's a mom blogger now?

234
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,860
That wild woman

235
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,820
is now a model housewife.

236
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,070
Look at all those '80s kids.

237
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,860
Zhou Shui with his wife and kid.

238
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,780
Ms. Dai's with Mr. Zhang.

239
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,650
Even Reverb's got a kid.

240
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,990
More than one, even!

241
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,400
Back then they were all about

242
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,700
being wild and free.

243
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,700
Now?

244
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,450
They all turned out traditional.

245
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,280
In their 40s and all settled down.

246
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,680
Is having a family such a bad thing?

247
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,240
Look around. Everyone here's got one.

248
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,280
I don't anymore.

249
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,650
You don't?

250
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,740
What do you mean?

251
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,070
My parents got divorced,

252
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,990
and they sold the house.

253
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,740
I didn't even like

254
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,450
that home much growing up,

255
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,530
but now that it's actually gone,

256
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,450
it kind of hurts.

257
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,530
Now I don't even have
a home to go back to anymore.

258
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,110
Why don't you come home with me?

259
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,900
What do you mean?

260
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,360
My place is just ahead.

261
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,040
My parents can make you poached egg
in fermented glutinous rice soup.

262
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,320
It's sweet.
Eat that and you won't feel sad anymore.

263
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,880
You're introducing me to your parents?

264
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,900
You said you wanted a home, right?

265
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,280
I can give you one.

266
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,950
Stop joking around.

267
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,650
I'm not joking.

268
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,740
What, scared?

269
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,360
Me? Scared?

270
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,280
I'm not scared of anything.

271
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,070
Where's your house? Up ahead?

272
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,780
Yes, just there.

273
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,740
Let's go.

274
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,570
Let's do it.

275
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,320
You think your parents
would accept someone like me?

276
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,610
An unemployed model,

277
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,200
broken family,

278
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,650
older than you?

279
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,610
No problem.

280
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,680
My mom was a Sichuan opera actress,
and she's two years older than my dad.

281
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,150
You said it.

282
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:41,860
I did.

283
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,610
Then I'm staying with you guys for good.

284
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,860
I'll eat your food,
drink your drinks, live in your house.

285
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,280
I'd never want you to leave.

286
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,320
You're serious about this?

287
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,950
Lead the way.

288
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,110
Let's go.

289
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,280
We're here.

290
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,780
Already?

291
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,110
Yes, this is where I live.

292
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,950
I shouldn't show up empty-handed.
I'll buy some fruits.

293
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,450
It's okay. Don't worry about that.

294
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,610
Oh, look at the time.

295
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,280
Your mother must be sleeping.

296
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,610
Oh, don't worry about it.

297
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,030
My parents stay up late.
They're probably still watching TV.

298
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,900
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

299
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,740
You said it.

300
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,900
Where will I sleep?

301
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,070
In my room.

302
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,110
Your room?

303
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,490
What about you?

304
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,570
I'll take the couch.

305
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,900
Let's go.

306
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,490
Come on!

307
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,860
Wait! Wait!

308
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,030
Fine. You win.

309
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,240
What do you mean?

310
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,440
- Are you really taking me in?
- What do you mean I win?

311
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,200
Are you kidding me?

312
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,280
There's a limit to joking!

313
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,860
I'm not joking!

314
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,740
I really like you!

315
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,860
Are you insane?

316
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,640
So all that time we spent meant nothing?

317
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,520
You've got an avoidant personality,
so stop pretending to be a narcissist.

318
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,900
Tong Leyi, don't go!

319
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,150
Go after her!

320
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,610
Your love is doomed!

321
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,400
Your love is running away!

322
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,240
Aren't you heartbroken?

323
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,980
(Summer 2012, Beijing)

324
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,280
Mom! Over here!

325
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,990
My goodness!

326
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,320
Everyone's already left
and now you show up?

327
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,650
Seriously.

328
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,070
I was at work.

329
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,030
I had to ask my boss for time off

330
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,360
to come pick you up.

331
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,280
Haven't seen you in so long.

332
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:45,990
Did you miss me?

333
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,320
Of course I did!

334
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,900
Why'd you suddenly come here?

335
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,490
Because I missed you.

336
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,780
Can't I come see you?

337
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,240
You can.

338
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:52,920
Am I not welcome?

339
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,120
Of course you're welcome here.

340
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,860
How long are you planning to stay?

341
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,070
I don't really have much going on,

342
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,360
so probably ten days, maybe two weeks.

343
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,450
That long?

344
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,150
What?

345
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,450
I can't stay that long?

346
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,700
You can.

347
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,150
Where's Zhou Shui?

348
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,740
He's at work.

349
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,990
His future mother-in-law is here

350
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,150
and he didn't come pick me up?

351
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,950
You two had a fight, didn't you?

352
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,280
No, we're just too busy.

353
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,900
We don't even have time to argue.

354
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,360
I'll grab a cab.

355
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,720
Why take a cab? That's expensive!

356
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,120
- But...
- Let's just take the subway.

357
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,530
What's wrong with hailing a cab?

358
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,240
You're so wasteful!

359
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,030
Seriously!

360
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,280
Daji! Over here!

361
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,070
Zhaoyang, what are you doing here?

362
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,110
This is my boss.

363
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,240
When you called me for time off,

364
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,200
I happened to be in Shunyi
meeting someone,

365
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,040
so I figured I'd swing by
since it's on the way.

366
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,280
Mom, this is my boss, Zhaoyang.

367
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,680
- Hello.
- You must be Daji's mother.

368
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,640
Yes, this is my mother.

369
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,320
Nice to meet you.

370
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,070
You look so young.

371
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,150
You're too kind.

372
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,000
Great to see you.

373
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,760
Why are you just standing there?
Get in the car!

374
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,320
- This is too much trouble...
- Come on.

375
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,360
You didn't tell me your boss
was coming to pick us up.

376
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,320
I didn't make myself presentable.
I'm a total mess!

377
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:55,920
Just get in.

378
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,200
What's he doing here?

379
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,110
He picked us up from the airport.

380
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,950
Zhaoyang, Zhou Shui's here.

381
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,490
Have a seat.

382
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,280
He was doing a reshoot up
at the Great Wall today.

383
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,990
Already started drinking?

384
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,700
Where's your mother?

385
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,780
She went to the bathroom
as soon as she got here.

386
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:37,840
Oh my goodness!

387
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,400
Mrs. Dai.

388
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,110
Who is this?

389
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,720
- Easy there.
- Be careful.

390
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,700
Be careful.

391
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,450
Sorry. Redo.

392
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,570
And now, presenting Xiaoya!

393
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,700
So you were touching up
your makeup, Mrs. Dai.

394
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:55,860
I...

395
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,860
Still as bad with words as ever.

396
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,570
Such a young lady must be Daji's sister!

397
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,570
Oh, you flatter me.

398
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,610
Have a seat, Xiaoya.

399
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,740
Just call me Mrs. Dai.

400
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,030
Here.

401
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:14,450
Mrs. Dai.

402
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,200
For you.

403
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,070
Try this, Xiaoya.

404
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,640
Thank you.

405
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,160
I put the sauce in it just for you.

406
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,110
Thank you so much.

407
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,960
You really didn't have
to go to all this trouble.

408
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,400
And don't call me "boss."

409
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,070
I don't see them as my employees.

410
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,490
They're like younger siblings to me.

411
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,110
Young people need to be held
to high standards.

412
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,200
What they're missing is experience.

413
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,610
We'll work hard, Zhaoyang.

414
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,400
Don't worry. Daji is one of my best.

415
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,150
I've no complaints about her work.

416
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,610
I heard

417
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,570
she just got promoted, right?

418
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,400
That's right.

419
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:42,990
Yes.

420
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,030
- Just a little step up.
- Planning Director.

421
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:48,110
She's Zhou Shui's higher-up now.

422
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,150
So...

423
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,740
How's Zhou Shui doing?

424
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,030
I'm currently filming a new ad...

425
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:03,360
Well, he still has a few "artist quirks"
that he needs to fix.

426
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,450
Your biggest issue is you aim too high

427
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,030
without the foundation.

428
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,780
Not like Daji. She's solid.

429
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,280
I think Zhou Shui's doing pretty well.

430
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,150
Young people

431
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,450
should stay grounded.

432
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,610
The bread will come.

433
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,400
Dreams will come true.

434
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,990
But in the meantime,

435
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,240
try to take some pressure off Daji.

436
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,450
- Stop making her clean up after you.
- He doesn't...

437
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,990
Don't just chase your dreams
without thinking.

438
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,280
Zhou Shui is talented.

439
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,490
He's an artist.

440
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,450
So he never helps you out, huh?

441
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,530
We're not...

442
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,740
We divide things between us.

443
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,450
Um, Mrs. Dai,

444
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,820
let me give you a toast.

445
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,900
Welcome to Beijing.

446
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,360
Look, Zhou Shui.

447
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,700
There are things I must say to you.

448
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,610
I'm not trying to nag.

449
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,200
No. Go ahead.

450
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,150
Mr. Lai's right.

451
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,400
A man needs

452
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,070
to take responsibility.

453
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,070
What's the price per square meter

454
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,400
in Beijing right now?

455
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,570
A bit over 10,000, I think.

456
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,400
The average is almost 30,000 now.

457
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,700
It's only going

458
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,070
to go up.

459
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,820
Exactly.

460
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,990
You'll need to buy a place eventually.

461
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,070
Better sooner than later.

462
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,030
Money sitting in the bank loses value.

463
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,530
Have you talked to your family
about buying a place?

464
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,120
What are your thoughts on this?

465
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,990
Mrs. Dai, I'm not planning on buying

466
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,780
anytime soon.

467
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,950
Two years ago, you came to my house

468
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,950
and swore up and down
that if we gave you two years,

469
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,530
you'd give Daji a home.

470
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,320
It's been two years.

471
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,110
Where's the house? Where's the home?

472
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,030
Mom, I think

473
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,570
renting is fine.

474
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,450
If you don't like a place,

475
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,200
you can always move somewhere else,

476
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,950
right?

477
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,400
If we throw everything we have

478
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,780
into a down payment,

479
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,650
we'd be under a lot of pressure.

480
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,490
That's not a very wise move.

481
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,840
That's what he said, right?

482
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,900
His idea, wasn't it?

483
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,840
I said it.

484
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,570
- You said it?
- That's what I really think.

485
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:14,680
Really?

486
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,950
You're still as stubborn as ever!

487
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,820
You're not getting any younger,
you know that?

488
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,450
I can't believe you!

489
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,240
Let me be clear.

490
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,640
I don't care where you two choose
to build your careers.

491
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,900
I don't care how far from home you go.

492
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,150
I'm not asking you to take care of me.

493
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,780
When I'm old, I'll go to a nursing home.

494
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,400
But wherever you work,

495
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,990
you should have a home there.

496
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,030
How can this rootless lifestyle
give you any sense of security?

497
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,990
Can you reassure your parents with this?

498
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,610
You two chose Beijing.

499
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,030
You made the choice.

500
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,400
Now, you live with the consequences.

501
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,780
Am I right?

502
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,360
Xiaoya, let's have a drink.

503
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:16,860
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

504
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,200
(Amount due: 1668)
Your bill, sir.

505
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,820
This one's on me.

506
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,280
Oh, that's too kind of you.

507
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,610
It's your first meal here.

508
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,570
It has to be my treat.

509
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,950
Sorry for the trouble, Mr. Lai.

510
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,900
No trouble at all.

511
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:38,820
Thanks, Zhaoyang.

512
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,825
(Hebei Mobile welcomes you!)

513
00:21:50,825 --> 00:21:51,960
(Have a great day every day!)

514
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,320
"Hebei welcomes you?"

515
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,160
What's that supposed to mean?

516
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,030
Where are we now?

517
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,240
This is Hebei? Are you kidding me?

518
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,820
We already left Beijing!

519
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,570
Hebei and Beijing aren't that different.

520
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,450
How are they even close to the same?

521
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,240
Zhou Shui!

522
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,400
Explain!

523
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,200
What is the meaning of this?

524
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,570
Where do you guys actually live?

525
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,570
You're so annoying.

526
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,280
Didn't you say you lived in Beijing?

527
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,490
We live in Yanjiao.

528
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,240
Just stop here.

529
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,240
We're literally a few steps away.

530
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,200
Are you sure?

531
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,490
I ate too much just now.

532
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,650
Let's walk it off.

533
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,570
Seriously.

534
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,490
Thank you.

535
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,200
This meter is giving me anxiety!

536
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,030
It's about to hit 200 yuan!

537
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,400
We're just a few steps away.

538
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,450
What kind of place do you live in?

539
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,610
Out in the middle of nowhere.

540
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,560
It's not exactly the middle of nowhere.

541
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,070
It's not even inside Beijing.

542
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,450
A lot of people live out here.

543
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:46,900
They're all like us.

544
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,150
Working in the city.

545
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:48,860
Right?

546
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,280
Right.

547
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,950
You guys pay 200 for a cab ride home

548
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:51,820
every time?

549
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,070
We don't often take the cab.

550
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,280
We usually take the bus.

551
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,200
Seriously.

552
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,240
Daji lives this far away with you...

553
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,640
Why are you bringing him into this?

554
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,880
If I'd known this,
I wouldn't have let her come to Beijing!

555
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,200
Jingshu.

556
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,570
Daji.

557
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,400
You know each other?

558
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,530
She's my roommate, Jingshu.

559
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,740
We live together.

560
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,440
This is my mom.

561
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,160
- She just got to Beijing.
- Hello, Mrs. Dai.

562
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,780
Hello.

563
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,950
Why don't we all walk back together?

564
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:21,650
Sure.

565
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:22,820
Okay.

566
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,990
Let's go. It's just ahead.

567
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,200
Mrs. Dai, I'll show you the way.

568
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,110
Who was that?

569
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,110
I'll explain later.

570
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,640
That's...

571
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,650
Tell Zhou Shui not to say anything
to Dumbbell.

572
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:32,990
Here we are.

573
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,570
Welcome home.

574
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,030
Welcome, Mrs. Dai!

575
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,200
- Hello.
- Welcome to Beijing.

576
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,900
Welcome.

577
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,320
We aren't in Beijing anymore.

578
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,200
Close enough.

579
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,490
Yanjiao is basically Beijing.

580
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,530
These are Dumbbell and Jingshu's rooms.

581
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,920
Mrs. Dai,
we're going to tidy up real quick.

582
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,820
Go ahead.

583
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,990
Why are you home so late again?

584
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,860
I had to work overtime.

585
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:02,280
We should book a hotel

586
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,070
for your mom tomorrow.

587
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,900
She'd never agree to that
if it costs money.

588
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,200
She'd feel it's a waste.

589
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,150
Look.

590
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,780
That's just how she talks.

591
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,610
She's blunt, not exactly tactful.

592
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,450
Don't take it personally.

593
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,530
It's fine.

594
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,200
Sorry you have to deal with this.

595
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,160
It's okay. It's nice here.

596
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,520
You go rest. Get some sleep early.

597
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,240
- Okay.
- We've got an early start tomorrow.

598
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,610
Keep your back supported.

599
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:28,520
Don't let it get sore.

600
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,530
- Good night.
- Good night.

601
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,990
Oh my gosh!

602
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,240
It's past eight!

603
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,240
Mom!

604
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,780
Why didn't my alarm go off?

605
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,110
Mom!

606
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,570
What did you do, Mom?

607
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:56,820
Why didn't my alarm go off?

608
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,400
You both looked like
you were sleeping badly last night,

609
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,280
so I turned it off
to let you sleep in a little.

610
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,700
You turned off my alarm?

611
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,150
I have work! I'm going to be late!

612
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,450
You're not helping me!

613
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,700
Zhou Shui!

614
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,650
Zhou Shui! Get up!

615
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:09,360
Come on! Get up!

616
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,490
It's after eight!
We're going to be late! Get up!

617
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:12,820
What time is it?

618
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,110
Can you please

619
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,860
stop messing us up?

620
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,200
Daji. Why don't you just stay home

621
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,320
and spend time with your mom?

622
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,040
- I'll call in sick for you.
- Stay home?

623
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,680
Are you kidding?

624
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,960
There's so much going on at work.

625
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,950
All right. What about...
Well, you have to eat some breakfast!

626
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,320
I already made it for you!

627
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,200
Daji!

628
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:34,860
I even made

629
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,240
your favorite hot dry noodles.

630
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,700
Just have some, okay?

631
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:40,280
You both have some, okay?

632
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,280
Hurry!

633
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,780
Mom!

634
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,780
We're off!

635
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,360
Hurry up!

636
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,490
We won't be having breakfast.

637
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,400
Breakfast's ready!
I even made steamed buns!

638
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,780
I read it.

639
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,400
What do you think of the script?

640
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,110
This is my fifth revision.

641
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,450
You still haven't fully grasped it.

642
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,240
Your characters
still don't have any soul.

643
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:14,030
So what does it mean

644
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,610
for a character to have soul?

645
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:17,610
No one can answer that for you.

646
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,320
You have to figure it out for yourself.

647
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:20,360
Go back

648
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,450
and finish reading Tolstoy,

649
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,570
read all of Lermontov's poetry,

650
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,650
study every one of Chekhov's

651
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,860
short stories.

652
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:30,570
Then rewatch

653
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,700
Woody Allen's Manhattan
and Annie Hall twice.

654
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,280
Maybe then it'll click.

655
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:38,030
Can you just explain it
a little more clearly?

656
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,150
Who am I?

657
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,450
I'm the client.

658
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,900
And what do clients do?

659
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,450
We bring the money.

660
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,280
You do what we say.

661
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,820
You revise how we tell you to revise.

662
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,610
Am I understood?

663
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,950
Yes, you're right.

664
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,820
Then get to it!

665
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,900
I'll revise it just the way you said.

666
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,360
So get moving!

667
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:03,530
Something wrong with your hands?
Or your brain?

668
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,950
Why are you dragging your feet?

669
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,680
If you don't want this job, refund me!
I'll get someone else to do it!

670
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,320
I don't get it!

671
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,720
I found him the Great Wall!

672
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,650
I went all the way
to Badaling to scout locations!

673
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:15,480
Still not good enough.

674
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,000
He just has to have an aircraft carrier.

675
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,840
"I want that carrier!"

676
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,560
They asked
for an industrial aircraft carrier.

677
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,640
So of course they expect one.

678
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,320
So what's wrong
with an industrial Great Wall?

679
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,640
This is about your attitude.
You blow up at a client and then?

680
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,840
I have to go smooth things over?

681
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,120
Listen.

682
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,520
- Can't you just be nice for once?
- If you act soft with clients

683
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:28,920
like this,

684
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,480
- But they're still the client.
- they'll just walk all over you!

685
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,760
So you go off on them
and then I have to clean up?

686
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,560
Can you please stop
making me fix your messes?

687
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,400
Fine. But I never even
thought about these things.

688
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,120
- I'm just really tired, okay?
- I just think people like that...

689
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:41,740
Mom.

690
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:42,820
Mrs. Dai.

691
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:43,740
You're back.

692
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,080
Mrs. Dai.

693
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,640
Have you eaten? I'll go reheat the food.

694
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,400
We already ate, Mom.
We ate at the office.

695
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,240
There's fruit too.
I bought fresh fruit today.

696
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,240
We're good.

697
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,990
It's too late for fruits.

698
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,780
We're just talking about work stuff.

699
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,610
Go to sleep.

700
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,740
Zhou Shui, come here!

701
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,480
I know that client is difficult.

702
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,280
But can't you just be

703
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,520
- a little more accommodating?
- He's not just difficult!

704
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,320
He's out of his mind!

705
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,400
Fine, he's out of his mind.

706
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,450
But what do we do about it?
He's still a client.

707
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,110
Don't make me clean up
after your outbursts

708
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,080
every single time, okay?

709
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,950
I know. I don't want you
to fix it for me either.

710
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,360
But I just can't shoot this.

711
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,900
Zhou Shui, I'm exhausted every day.

712
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,070
I've got my own job to do.

713
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,240
He gave me 20,000 yuan

714
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,400
to shoot an aircraft carrier.

715
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,760
How in the world am I supposed
to get an aircraft carrier?

716
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,200
Mom.

717
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,860
Mom, I'm heading out.

718
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,570
You're skipping breakfast again.

719
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,070
What's wrong?

720
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,200
Are you crying?

721
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,650
- What's the matter?
- Quick.

722
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,450
Where's Zhou Shui?

723
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,780
What about him?

724
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,860
Get him to notice me.

725
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,820
He went downstairs.

726
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,360
Downstairs?

727
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,240
He left before I did.

728
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,900
He already left?

729
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,450
- You're kidding me!
- What's wrong?

730
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,560
That boy just walks out
without even telling me!

731
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,820
All that effort for nothing.

732
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,610
Why were you pretending to cry

733
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,650
with eye drops?

734
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,820
What's going on with you?

735
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,240
I just wanted him to see

736
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,110
how much I worry about my daughter.

737
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,570
He's put you through so much
these past two years!

738
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,700
How can

739
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,530
he be so heartless?

740
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,400
Letting you live so far out,

741
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,990
and not even cooking for you!

742
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,570
Mom.

743
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,820
That scene was a bit much.

744
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:21,610
Too much?

745
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:22,820
You weren't very convincing.

746
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,610
How was it not convincing?
This time it's for real, okay?

747
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:26,450
Still over the top.

748
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,950
I disagree. I thought it was good.

749
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,990
I know you worry about us,

750
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,820
but we're honestly doing fine.

751
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,480
I'm your mother. I can tell right away

752
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,200
whether your relationship
is going fine or not.

753
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,800
Let me tell you.

754
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,490
I've eaten more salt
than you've eaten rice.

755
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,240
That much salt?

756
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,860
Are you sure that's good for you?

757
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:44,780
You!

758
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,360
I know you saw us arguing

759
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,650
yesterday.

760
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,280
But it was just

761
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,240
about work.

762
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,860
It doesn't mean we don't get along.

763
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,240
Don't worry.

764
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:57,990
You're overthinking things.

765
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,780
And using eye drops to fake cry?

766
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:05,150
Now you're just milking it.

767
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:08,000
I'm going to be late for work.
They dock my pay if I'm late.

768
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,780
They do that?

769
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,610
Fine. Get going.

770
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,530
Go to work.

771
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,610
Go on!

772
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:14,490
Stay home.

773
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,450
See you later.

774
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,650
(Ratings for "Empresses in the Palace")

775
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,070
(continued to climb as it aired.)

776
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,450
(By the finale,)

777
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,150
(it surpassed 2% viewership,)

778
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,490
(topping the boards.)

779
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,530
(Will "Empresses in the Palace")

780
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:32,240
(go down as an all-time favorite
Qing dynasty drama?)

781
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,780
The food smells amazing, Mrs. Dai!

782
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,110
Try my cooking.

783
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,070
Smells great in here.

784
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,030
Welcome back!

785
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,450
- You cooked.
- Come, come!

786
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,110
Of course!

787
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,070
I made your favorites!

788
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,400
Wow!

789
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,450
Let's eat, Daji.

790
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:15,200
Fish ball soup,

791
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,200
beer duck,

792
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,740
braised pork knuckle, and mandarin fish.

793
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,900
Thank you, Mrs. Dai.

794
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,990
Try it.

795
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:24,570
So good!
This fish tastes just like back home.

796
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,450
Amazing!

797
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,610
Zhou Shui.

798
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,650
You should learn how to cook from me
when you have time.

799
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,320
Mrs. Dai, I've been really busy lately.

800
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,450
But if I have time, I...

801
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,240
I've got time! I'll learn from you.

802
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:36,860
Then Jingshu can have a hot meal

803
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,990
when she comes home.

804
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,440
Zhou Shui,
if you can make her life easier,

805
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,570
you don't even have to cook.

806
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:43,400
Mrs. Dai.

807
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,820
We live kind of far out.

808
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,490
Right.

809
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:46,900
If it's far, why not buy a car?

810
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,110
Look at Jingshu.

811
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,280
She has someone to drive her every day,

812
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,150
while Daji has to take the subway.

813
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,610
- Mom...
- Don't you think...

814
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,520
Who's driving Jingshu every day?

815
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,780
What are you talking about?

816
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,450
Who's driving Jingshu around?

817
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,160
My mistake.

818
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,650
You must've seen wrong, Mrs. Dai.

819
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,650
Yes. You got the wrong person.

820
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,800
- That isn't her.
- I...

821
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,760
It couldn't have been me.

822
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,490
I was just saying stuff.

823
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,490
It was a cab, right?

824
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,490
Just eat, Mom.

825
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:15,780
Maybe.

826
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,860
What did Mrs. Dai mean just now?

827
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,360
Who's getting driven around every day?

828
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,280
She said she was mistaken.

829
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,070
Eat your food.

830
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,400
What are you thinking about?

831
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,240
Seriously?

832
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,030
Has someone been

833
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,280
picking you up and dropping you off?

834
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:49,530
No, I always take the subway.

835
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,150
Liar.

836
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,700
Why do you think I'm lying?

837
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:02,360
That time it snowed hard in winter,
you said you took the subway,

838
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,900
but when you got home,

839
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,070
your clothes and shoes were dry.

840
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,070
Jingshu.

841
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:16,280
(A few months ago)
That car you sold to Mr. Liao

842
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,740
has a rattling sunroof.

843
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,680
A rattling sunroof?

844
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,490
So we're assigning you to be
the after-sales specialist.

845
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,150
Me?

846
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,860
To help

847
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,240
fix the issue.

848
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,570
I don't know how to fix cars.

849
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,240
You don't need to.

850
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,900
So what do I do?

851
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,530
Just sit in Mr. Liao's car each day

852
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:35,490
and experience the noise.

853
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,900
Just ride along for about 50 kilometers.

854
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:42,450
Manager,

855
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,150
I've got my own job to do.

856
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,990
I really can't take this on.

857
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:46,740
Jingshu.

858
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,490
When I hired you,

859
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,860
what did you say to me?

860
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,040
You said you'd work hard
and follow my lead.

861
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,240
Now this is your attitude?

862
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:55,990
Do you even realize

863
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,030
what level of client Mr. Liao is?

864
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,450
What if he demands a refund?

865
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:00,820
What if he files a complaint?

866
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,640
You know exactly how much damage
that could do to our dealership.

867
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:04,450
This favor,

868
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,280
no, this task,

869
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,570
has to be done by you.

870
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,400
If you don't do it right,
not only will you be fired,

871
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,400
I'll lose this job too!

872
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,450
That's 50 kilometers.

873
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,700
Please pull over.

874
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:04,900
Could you stop the car, please?

875
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,610
Sir.

876
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:10,950
Don't you know better?

877
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,780
It's late. Take the young lady home.

878
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,650
That's not necessary.

879
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,150
Just drop me off

880
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,400
at the next bus stop.

881
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,110
It's a holiday.

882
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,780
It's not safe
for a young lady to be out this late.

883
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,110
It's really okay.

884
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,700
Pull over.

885
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:50,700
I'm back.

886
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,200
Didn't think
I'd get home this late today.

887
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,030
You must be starving.

888
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:57,900
Jingshu.

889
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:01,200
This job is inhumane.

890
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,610
Who works overtime this late every day?

891
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,200
You must've been

892
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,450
bottling up a lot.

893
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,450
You should just quit tomorrow.

894
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,860
If I quit, what would we live on?

895
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,820
I'll take care of you.

896
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,280
Look what I've got.

897
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:24,950
Who wants one?

898
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:26,990
Here. Nobody?

899
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:27,900
Grab one.

900
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,610
Mr. Liao.

901
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,490
Why are you having boxed lunches?

902
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,240
Mr. Liao, we all eat boxed lunches.

903
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:39,820
That stuff has no nutrition.

904
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,780
Put the fish maw there. Yes, there.

905
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,700
Hurry up.

906
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,400
Okay. You can go.

907
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,720
Just do it for our dealership.

908
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,150
You're our store's lucky charm now.

909
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:51,530
Come on!

910
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,030
- Mr. Liao!
- Mr. Liao.

911
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:55,150
Jingshu.
I had them prepare lobster just for you.

912
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,200
Mr. Liao, I'm allergic to seafood.

913
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:01,030
Then eat the fish maw.
It's great for women. Keeps you pretty.

914
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,240
No thanks. I'm not hungry.

915
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,070
You...

916
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,400
Gather around!

917
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,860
It's Mr. Liao's treat!

918
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,570
Get moving!

919
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,030
Come on!

920
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,150
Another late night?

921
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,610
Looking at your palm,
you've got a lucky star.

922
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,650
Your fortune looks strong too.

923
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,280
Do you have a boyfriend?

924
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:39,900
Yes.

925
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,900
He must be a strong guy.

926
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,950
But there's someone

927
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,860
blocking your fortune.

928
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,700
The snow tonight is beautiful.

929
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,530
When we were kids,

930
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,200
we couldn't even go outside

931
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,400
if it snowed this much.

932
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:10,570
But look at us now,

933
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,490
sitting in a car watching the snow.

934
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:14,360
Stop the car.

935
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,740
That's 50 kilometers.

936
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:38,110
Don't wait out here.
Let me send you home.

937
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,490
I'm fine. My bus is coming soon.

938
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,780
Why are you always so polite with me?

939
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,280
How about this?

940
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,450
Let my driver send you home.

941
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:52,900
I'll wait for the bus.

942
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,070
You don't even know when it's coming.

943
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,360
That's okay.

944
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:02,700
My grandma used to say

945
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,450
waiting for a bus that won't come

946
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,820
is like waiting
for someone who never will.

947
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:11,900
I want to feel what that's like too.

948
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:33,820
Sorry.

949
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,820
The number you dialed
is currently unavailable.

950
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,360
Please try again later.

951
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:13,030
I think I took a cab that day.

952
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,070
Didn't really walk outside.

953
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,150
So now all taxis

954
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,740
use the same fragrance?

955
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,700
What?

956
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,990
You've had
a certain smell on you lately.

957
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,950
It's the same smell you had on you

958
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:35,780
that snowy day.

959
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,110
What's going on?

960
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,320
Dumbbell, you have to trust me.

961
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,450
I would never do anything to hurt you.

962
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,150
I'm happy with you.

963
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:03,070
All I want is to live my life with you.

964
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,320
I don't want anything else.

965
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,450
Please believe me, okay?

966
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:11,780
Okay.

967
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,240
Shen Jingshu!

968
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:32,400
Don't get the wrong idea.
Jingshu's just working.

969
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,240
It was the client's request.

970
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:44,320
We're going home.

971
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,110
Helmet on.

972
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,780
Hold on tight, Jingshu.

973
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,070
Hold on!

974
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,200
Let's go!

975
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,450
We're going home!

976
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,360
Youngsters these days.

977
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,840
(Dramatic Effect, Please Do Not Imitate)

978
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,680
Why are you grinning?

979
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,150
Did you see his face just now?

980
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:40,570
I did.

981
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,450
He's jealous of us.

982
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:45,700
He thinks having a little money
makes him all that.

983
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,740
Can he buy true love though?

984
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,070
I'm sorry.

985
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,490
I should've told you.

986
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,450
I'll resign first thing tomorrow.

987
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:00,200
Don't.

988
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:01,450
Don't quit.

989
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:02,400
Stay and do your best.

990
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,400
You can't leave.

991
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,280
Why not?

992
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,780
Because our love is worth
more than his lousy money!

993
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:10,780
I want him to see

994
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:12,950
that love isn't something

995
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,570
you can just buy!

996
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:17,740
Stop being ridiculous.

997
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:20,570
I will beat him one day!
