00:00:08,449 --> 00:00:09,779
You should've been more careful.

Do you want to go for food?
Let's go.

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,890
Come to your senses, Hong Seol.
You can't let that smile fool you.

(Seo Kang Joon, Lee Sung Kyung)

You're home.

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,420
- Hi.
- Hi.

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,320
Seol, I've been thinking
all evening.

13
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:55,429
We...

14
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:01,000
What was that?

15
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:02,899
What...

16
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:04,400
What just...

17
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,170
Yes.

18
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:12,780
A lot of bad things happened.
He's been through a lot.

19
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:14,909
He needed to be comforted.

20
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,510
Instead of the teddy bear.

21
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:21,519
Or did he lose his mind?

22
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,000
It's cold.

23
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,609
Wrap up.

24
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:58,519
I'm a moron. I'm an idiot.

25
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,629
Why did I do that?

26
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,469
Your week is almost up.

27
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,770
Do you have the cash?

(Episode 14)

32
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:51,780
Where are you? I'm on campus.
Are you free?

33
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,250
Pick one you like.

34
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,889
- What?
- Go on.

35
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:07,930
I like...

36
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,129
- This one?
- How did you know?

37
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,000
It's totally my style.

38
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:14,400
Wrap this up, please.

39
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:16,169
You don't have to wrap it.

40
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:19,770
It's my first gift to Mo Na.

41
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,039
It should be wrapped.

42
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:27,050
She paid me extra
and fed me every day.

43
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,419
I've never bought a woman anything.

44
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,020
Thanks for helping.

45
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,800
Are you upset because
Eun Taek didn't get you anything?

46
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,169
Why would I be?

47
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,909
I've just...

48
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:57,710
never seen him that serious before.

49
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:02,909
And I think that Mo Na
person is pretty.

50
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,689
Do you want to get some coffee?

51
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:10,419
- My treat.
- Okay.

52
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:13,830
You're way prettier.

53
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,930
I know that.

54
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,199
Wait up.

55
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,410
Gosh.

56
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,250
- The professor's late.
- She's usually on time.

57
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,620
What's wrong?

58
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,290
The sample tests are missing.

59
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:48,930
- The sample tests?
- Yes.

60
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,329
What Jung gave you?

61
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,199
Where did it go?

62
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,370
- Da Young.
- What?

63
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,240
Didn't you go over to
Seol's seat earlier?

64
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:00,069
- When?
- I saw you.

65
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:01,240
Did I leave it at home?

66
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,610
What are you saying I did, Eun Ji?

67
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,410
- Nothing. Forget it.
- Unbelievable.

68
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:10,420
You didn't have
an extra pen I could borrow,

69
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,079
so I borrowed one of Seol's.

70
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,689
Did you borrow her pen?

71
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,889
Yes. I put it back in
her pencil case.

72
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,129
Is it in my locker?

73
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,100
We didn't open our lockers today.

74
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,529
Did someone take the sample tests?

75
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:30,300
It must be Sang Cheol.

76
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,970
He sat right behind you...

77
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,410
and wouldn't stop staring
at your back.

78
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,310
It must be him.

79
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:41,009
Where did he go?
Did anyone see him leave?

80
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:44,019
I saw him leave,
but it can't be him.

81
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,620
It was him.

82
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,990
What are you all doing here?

83
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,730
What did you just photocopy?

84
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,199
Professor Kang's printouts.
I lost mine.

85
00:05:58,259 --> 00:05:59,360
Let me see.

86
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:02,170
What's there to see?
Will you let go?

87
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,769
They're Professor Kang's.

88
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,610
I told you what they were.
Have you lost your mind?

89
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,910
It's just that Seol said...

90
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,180
she thought you took
the sample tests.

91
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,420
I did not.

92
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,519
Seol.

93
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,720
- Is that what you think of me?
- No.

94
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,790
Isn't it time for our next lecture?

95
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,720
- Give me that.
- See you later.

96
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:31,060
We didn't doubt you
for one second. Let's go.

97
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:34,300
Did you have to come up
like a group of zombies?

98
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,899
What a mess.

99
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:44,910
It's so nice to eat out with you
after so long.

100
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,180
- Aren't you pleased to see me?
- I am.

101
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,079
You haven't seen Jung
for a while.

102
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,720
Don't you want to know
how he's doing?

103
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,620
From now on, I will ask him
how he's doing in person.

104
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:00,629
You don't have to worry.

105
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:03,899
- Mr. Yu.
- In Ha.

106
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,000
Are you going to your classes now?

107
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,269
Well, I've been very busy lately.

108
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,699
I called to say
I'd register next week.

109
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:21,610
Mr. Yu, could you find me
a place to stay?

110
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:24,819
I'm sharing a tiny place with In Ho,

111
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,079
but a girl needs her personal space.

112
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:29,250
Just this once.

113
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:32,720
Then I'll study really hard and
get my licence right away.

114
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:36,730
You said that when you last
asked for money to rent a place.

115
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:40,500
I did, but this will be
the last time.

116
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:43,269
Or how about
I move back in with you?

117
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,800
I used to find this cute
when she was young.

118
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,610
I will consider finding you
a place to stay...

119
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:53,879
when you get your licence.

120
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,610
Okay.

121
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,699
Seol.

122
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:18,269
Seol.

123
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,399
Seol.

124
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,540
Corn dog.

125
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,310
Guys.

126
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,149
Hi.

127
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,220
You're in a good mood.
Did something great happen?

128
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,830
I'm always this cheerful.

129
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:42,259
Do you want some cheer?

130
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,830
Here you go. Be cheerful.

131
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,370
What's wrong with her?
She's out of it.

132
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,700
I don't know why,
but she won't react to anything.

133
00:08:56,309 --> 00:08:59,509
Right.
Did Mo Na like your present?

134
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:02,080
Oh, that?

135
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:06,720
Yes. She totally loved it.

136
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:10,250
She bought me expensive beef
to thank me.

137
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,820
It hurts my ego to be on
the receiving end.

138
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,360
She's older than you are.
It's fine to accept gifts.

139
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,070
She's beautiful, too.

140
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,870
She's a model.

141
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,789
Eun Taek.

142
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,529
It's clear lip balm. Use it.

143
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,799
- What for?
- Don't pick on your chapped lips.

144
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,269
You're a model
even though it's just part-time.

145
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,909
Put it on regularly.
Have fun at work.

146
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,279
Bye.

147
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:11,980
What's wrong?

148
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:20,259
- Bo Ra.
- What?

149
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,129
This happened to a friend of mine.
Tell me what you think.

150
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,059
Okay.

151
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:28,100
She has...

152
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,039
a friend who's a guy.

153
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,899
But she thinks...

154
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:36,009
the guy friend likes her.

155
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,309
But she doesn't want to
ruin their friendship.

156
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,980
What should she do?

157
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:45,179
Should she ignore what's happening?

158
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,720
Are you teasing me?

159
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:49,720
Are you talking about me?

160
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,720
I'm not.

161
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:57,129
It's true. I wasn't
talking about you.

162
00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:00,899
Go and tell your friend.

163
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:03,570
If she ignores the guy's advances,

164
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,769
he'll go and find someone else.

165
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,470
Girls think the guy will
like her forever. But no, he won't.

166
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,779
All the regret in the world
won't change anything.

167
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,009
Men are worse than women.

168
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:19,080
Fine. I'll be cool
and I'll let him go.

169
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,149
Did you drink all night?

170
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,889
Why don't you move to Russia
so you can get wasted?

171
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,360
Your final exam is tomorrow.

172
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,860
Worry about yourself, will you?

173
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,029
- You'll flunk.
- Seol.

174
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:37,070
Did you find out who took
the sample tests?

175
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,370
Isn't Sang Cheol acting weird?

176
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:42,210
He's slacking off
when he has an exam tomorrow,

177
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,179
and he isn't begging to
borrow your copy.

178
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:47,580
We confirmed that it wasn't him.

179
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,750
Something's fishy.

180
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:50,950
Eat up.

181
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:53,480
You and your hangovers.
Have my soup, too.

182
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:55,620
Are you still studying?

183
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:57,990
Have you given up all hope?

184
00:11:58,059 --> 00:11:59,059
No.

185
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:02,659
You worry me to no end.

186
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,799
Jae Woo, do you want a sausage?

187
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,360
A sausage? No thanks.

188
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,830
Still studying?

189
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,139
Close your books.

190
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,769
What is the point of you
taking tests? I don't know.

191
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,240
Close your books.

192
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:18,879
I bet that half of you
won't be able to graduate.

193
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:21,679
Close your books already.

194
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,809
Take one each.

195
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,879
You should've studied harder.

196
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,090
Procrastination never works.

197
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:32,659
Pass it quickly.

198
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:37,129
Give up if you don't know
the answer. Just write anything.

199
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,700
A month?

200
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,269
One whole month?

201
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,830
Please.

202
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,370
The great Baek In Ho bowed to me.

203
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,009
It's a miracle.

204
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,580
In Ho.

205
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:54,679
Let's not waste time and effort.

206
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,779
Just come with me.

207
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,480
Whether I give you a month or two,

208
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,889
you'll never get the money.

209
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:06,789
My piano competition is
a month away.

210
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:09,659
I'll give you the prize money.

211
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,059
You can play the piano?

212
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,129
Can anyone enter a competition
after practising for a few days?

213
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,070
What do you take me for?

214
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,269
Don't think you can con me.
I'm not stupid.

215
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:31,149
You'll lose 10,000 dollars
if you take me in now.

216
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,480
Give me one month...

217
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,220
and I'll give you the prize money
and my savings.

218
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,289
To be brutally honest,
if you take me in now,

219
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,690
I can run away again.

220
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,059
What will you do?

221
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,470
Yes, Boss. I have him here,
but there are complications.

222
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,370
I'll do whatever it takes...

223
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,740
to bring him over within a month,
so don't worry.

224
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,379
Yes, Boss.

225
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:01,879
Bye.

226
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,720
I get In Ho and the money.

227
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,289
Two birds with one stone.

228
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,690
I have nothing to lose.

229
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:16,990
In Ho.

230
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,470
- What?
- In Ho.

231
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,730
Take this.

232
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:25,470
Put it away.

233
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,769
I saved some up.

234
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,909
It's not much but still.

235
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,879
I'd love it...

236
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:34,009
if you came back.

237
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,480
But I think you're happier here.

238
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,250
Sang Geun.

239
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,289
I have to go.

240
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,289
Go on.

241
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:01,269
One month.

242
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,830
Just one month.

243
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:42,470
The exam went okay.
I just need a pass.

244
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,009
Where will you eat dinner, then?

245
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,379
I'll eat it when I get home.

246
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:50,679
Then come to the restaurant.
There's nothing to eat at home.

247
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:52,019
Okay.

248
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,750
Is In Ho there?

249
00:16:56,789 --> 00:16:59,059
In Ho? Shall I put him on?

250
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,460
No, no.

251
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:05,599
Mum, I think I'll eat dinner
on the way home.

252
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,869
Bye.

253
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,759
- Is that dinner?
- Yes.

254
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,210
Is it that awkward to see me?

255
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,940
What? How...

256
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,680
How long will you avoid me for?

257
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:30,309
I don't know...

258
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:32,380
what you mean.

259
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,920
If you want to avoid me,
don't get caught.

260
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,819
It's all over your face.

261
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,170
In Ho...

262
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:49,730
I do like you.

263
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:52,940
But...

264
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:55,470
I won't ask for hugs...

265
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,640
or expect anything from you.

266
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:04,480
I'll deal with my own emotions.

267
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:11,220
Mad Hair. Stop trying to avoid me.

268
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,890
It makes me feel worse, okay?

269
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:18,660
Plus, that's not how to
treat someone...

270
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:20,359
you're grateful towards.

271
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,269
Is it?

272
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:29,470
Enjoy your meal.

273
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,509
Eat at home.

274
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:44,289
(Kimchi)

275
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:53,799
Yes.

276
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,400
I'll be happy for just one month.

277
00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:01,509
Love isn't a game

278
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,880
It's all about

279
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,480
- How you feel
- What got into her now?

280
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,779
- Love isn't a game
- Hey.

281
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:13,680
What?

282
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,349
I'm still older.

283
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:19,119
Aren't you cold?

284
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:21,930
Give me your jacket, then.

285
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:30,700
What's wrong with you? Are you sick?

286
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,869
Are you going to get that
Accounting and Data Entry licence?

287
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,039
No.

288
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,680
I didn't think so.

289
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:43,549
How about sell clothes, then?

290
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,480
Are you going to open me a shop?

291
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,990
Yes.

292
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:50,150
Not right now.

293
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,960
Why don't you work part-time
at a shop to gain experience?

294
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:56,789
- I'll help...
- What?

295
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:01,059
Quit beating around the bush
and get right to the point.

296
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,869
What a weirdo.

297
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,599
I'm leaving.

298
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,410
Not right now.

299
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,039
So what?

300
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,740
Come with me.

301
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,980
You lunatic.

302
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:21,150
Why would I?

303
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,390
I'm not kidding.

304
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,490
Think about it.

305
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,299
You're on your own.

306
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,599
I know that.

307
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,700
Mad Hair.

308
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:14,400
Why are you running away?

309
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:16,170
What do you mean?

310
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:18,779
I'm on the way to the cafeteria.

311
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:21,279
I'll walk you home after you finish.

312
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:23,180
Meet me by the front gate
at 6pm.

313
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:37,160
Wrong way.

314
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:40,700
Seol.

315
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,500
How did you do?

316
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:45,599
I passed.

317
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:48,710
I thought so. Good for you.

318
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,170
Did you...

319
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,279
I passed.

320
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,849
You scared me.

321
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:58,950
- I wasn't sure. It was so hard.
- It was.

322
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:00,779
Congratulations, Sang Cheol.

323
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,150
It's a miracle.

324
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,589
The exam was so easy.

325
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:07,390
How did you pass?

326
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,289
You barely even studied.

327
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:11,859
I'm smart, aren't I?

328
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:16,170
Attention, everyone.
Sang Cheol passed.

329
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,900
How did he pass when even I failed?

330
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,569
Dinner's on me.

331
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,740
Let's bleed him dry.

332
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:24,470
- Let's go.
- Come along, Da Young.

333
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,380
- No thanks.
- Why not?

334
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,509
- Why are you so strong?
- Why shouldn't I be?

335
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:31,750
- I don't want to go.
- I'll buy you something nice.

336
00:23:31,849 --> 00:23:33,680
- Come along if you want to eat.
- Let's go.

337
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:38,049
No, no.

338
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:40,390
Your left hand's slacking off.

339
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:42,559
Is your hand okay?

340
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,859
I practised too much.

341
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,029
It's just a bit stiff.
Don't worry.

342
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:50,299
See a doctor,
just to be on the safe side.

343
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:51,970
I will.

344
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,869
Can I practise in
the grand hall one day?

345
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:59,740
The acoustics there will be
similar to the competition hall's.

346
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:04,680
You wanted to quit not so long ago.
Why the sudden change?

347
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,019
You're either hot or cold.
Stick to one, will you?

348
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:11,150
It's best to go between both.

349
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,490
Don't overdo it today.
Rest your hands.

350
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:18,200
- I'll practise just a bit more.
- Okay.

351
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:20,160
I'm off.

352
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:30,269
What's wrong?

353
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:53,400
Forget about my birthday.

354
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:57,869
She'll throw a fit if I really do.

355
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,569
Where is she?

356
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,910
Which one is nicer?

357
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:21,289
Hello?

358
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,589
Where are you?

359
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,799
Something came up.

360
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,069
You're outside, aren't you?

361
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:31,700
You go on ahead.

362
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,650
This is totally her.

363
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,279
It's so her.

364
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,789
Which one's cuter?

365
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:52,619
Where are you going, Da Young?

366
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:54,559
The second round is on me.

367
00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:56,089
I really have to go.

368
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,930
Will you let go of me?

369
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,299
I know how you feel.

370
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,130
You're upset that
you failed the exam.

371
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:04,130
Don't ask. Now let me go.

372
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,410
- I just want to help you.
- Help me how?

373
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:10,569
Letting me go is helping me.

374
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,380
How about you trust me this once?

375
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,849
What's wrong with you?
Have you lost your mind?

376
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:20,380
Wait, wait. Wait.

377
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,990
Take this.

378
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:25,759
I haven't shown it to anyone else.

379
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:28,589
You can't tell anyone what you saw.

380
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,559
This is Jung's sample test.

381
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:33,599
Did you steal it?

382
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:36,099
No wonder you passed.

383
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,170
Sang Cheol.

384
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:39,400
How could you?

385
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,309
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

386
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:45,940
Well, you should've just let me
have a look.

387
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:49,049
You think you're all that
because you're smart,

388
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,480
and I hate your guts.

389
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:52,549
Think about what you did to me.

390
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:56,390
You told that I stole the fees and
left me out of the team project.

391
00:26:56,589 --> 00:26:58,960
So what if you're dating Jung?

392
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:02,190
- You aren't him.
- Why are you bringing him up?

393
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:07,200
You stole the money and you didn't
help with the team project.

394
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,569
You always blame others
and act like you're a victim.

395
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,700
You're the one who's the nuisance.

396
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,410
And now you're a thief.

397
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:18,140
You should know better.

398
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,180
There she is.

399
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,750
What? What did you say?

400
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,650
- Sang Cheol.
- Stop!

401
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,920
Have you lost your mind?

402
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:32,460
Are you okay?

403
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,859
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

404
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,490
Come over here.

405
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:41,200
- What's going on?
- What's wrong?

406
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,569
What's your problem?
Hit me if you can.

407
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,869
Go on home.

408
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,039
What's wrong?

409
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:50,470
- What was that about?
- Stop it.

410
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,940
What's his problem?

411
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,680
Does your back hurt?

412
00:27:55,779 --> 00:27:58,779
He has a weak punch
for someone so huge.

413
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,150
I'm fine.

414
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,759
I'm sorry.

415
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,789
I was kidding.

416
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:14,160
What about you?

417
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,299
Let me see.

418
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,069
You got scraped.

419
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,069
It'll heal by tomorrow.

420
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,180
So...

421
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:32,980
I'm starving.

422
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:37,089
Let's go and ask your mum
to cook us some noodles.

423
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:41,690
In Ho.

424
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:45,099
I think...

425
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,029
the polite thing to do
is to be direct.

426
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,140
(Jung)

427
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,150
Just for one month.

428
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,390
I know what you're going to say.

429
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,390
But...

430
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,589
Give me just one month.

431
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,029
Don't hide or avoid me.

432
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,799
Treat me like before.

433
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,769
What happens...

434
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:30,869
in one month?

435
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,279
I'll...

436
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,589
sort things out.

437
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,029
I promise.

438
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,670
Okay?

439
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,069
What's wrong?

440
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:05,180
Let's sort out your hand.

441
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,539
But first, let's eat some noodles.

442
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,390
Sang Cheol?

443
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,789
I can't believe he stooped that low.

444
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,589
Do you know Sunju Logistics?

445
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:25,029
Jeong Woo, one of our seniors
recommended him,

446
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:28,359
so Sang Cheol only has to
pass the final interview to get in.

447
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,299
Didn't he want to work at
a large company?

448
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,670
He applied to every one
he could think of.

449
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,410
Even Taerang, I think.

450
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:40,039
I think he expected to get in,
but we both know it's unlikely.

451
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,839
He's so under-qualified.

452
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,049
Okay, bye.

453
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:01,299
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

454
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,200
I heard you're hard at work.

455
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,400
Is it safe to show that
we know each other?

456
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,109
It's not,

457
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:12,180
but I need to ask you a favour.

458
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,180
- It's just my luck.
- Move, move.

459
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,009
- What is it now?
- Move.

460
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:20,150
I need to check my inbox.
It won't take a minute.

461
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,680
This sucks.

462
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,549
I'm ruined.

463
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,759
What's wrong?

464
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:28,890
I applied to Taerang Group's
internship programme.

465
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:30,690
It's not just you.

466
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:33,799
Me, Gyeong Hwan,
even Jae Woo didn't get in.

467
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,200
It's not that. Have a look.

468
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,400
At what?

469
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,400
You're kidding me!

470
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,109
Is this your name?

471
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,539
Do you think it's really mine?

472
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,740
Do you think it's a glitch
in the system?

473
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:49,509
Your grades and TOEIC scores
are worse than...

474
00:31:49,549 --> 00:31:50,950
mine and Jae Woo's.

475
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,180
My cover letter.

476
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,950
Was it that impressive?

477
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:59,890
Think about it. If he failed
and I got in, that must be it.

478
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:04,160
The interview is this Friday.

479
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:07,299
It's the same day as
my Sunju Logistics interview.

480
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,029
Jae Woo, which one would you pick?

481
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:13,299
Don't ask me.
I didn't get in, remember?

482
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,369
Let's eat dinner at Nari's.
You like that place.

483
00:32:16,509 --> 00:32:18,269
I said I didn't want to celebrate.

484
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:21,740
- I called Eun Taek already.
- What for?

485
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,380
I told him to be there by 7pm.

486
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:26,579
I didn't tell him
it's your birthday.

487
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,579
I just said it's my treat.

488
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:34,119
Isn't that Jung?

489
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,559
Why is he with Sang Cheol?

490
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,289
I think my cover letter worked.

491
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,500
Does he not know what happened?
Didn't you tell him?

492
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:42,930
I did.

493
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:47,200
- I think you stand a chance.
- Do you?

494
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:49,569
I don't believe this.

495
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,049
Why are you here at this hour?

496
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,549
I was told I could go
straight home from my meeting.

497
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,880
I wanted to see you, too.

498
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:02,490
Stop it.

499
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:03,990
Sorry.

500
00:33:04,589 --> 00:33:07,089
It's her birthday today.

501
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,589
We'll celebrate over dinner.
You can join us.

502
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:12,160
It sounds good.
Dinner's on me, then.

503
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,400
No thanks.

504
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:16,700
I don't want to see you lovebirds
on my birthday.

505
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,599
You haven't met in a while.

506
00:33:18,869 --> 00:33:20,299
Enjoy your time together.

507
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,369
We don't mind hanging out with you.

508
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,269
- Yes, let's do that.
- No way.

509
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,009
I'll meet up with Eun Taek.

510
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,279
Right, about him...

511
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:35,079
Sit him down and
talk things out, okay?

512
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,089
- Okay.
- I have something.

513
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:42,190
Happy Birthday. Let's spend
your next one together.

514
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:43,890
Thank you.

515
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:47,759
- Enjoy your date. Bye.
- I'll call you.

516
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:49,130
- See you.
- Bye.

517
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:02,680
Does she think I'm a kid?

518
00:34:04,579 --> 00:34:05,750
It's cute, though.

519
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,849
Eun Taek and Bo Ra
are going through a rough patch.

520
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:12,789
I set up the dinner.

521
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:23,099
I'm sorry, but I have to work late.

522
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,130
Have fun with Seol.

523
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:50,690
Where were you?

524
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,500
What are you doing here?

525
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:59,039
I said I'd be late.
Couldn't you wait?

526
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,400
I called Seol and got
the shock of my life.

527
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:04,769
Where were you until now?
You said you were with Seol.

528
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:08,639
Did you drink?

529
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:10,380
A bit.

530
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:12,079
I'm tired.

531
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,050
Good night.

532
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,650
Wait.

533
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:24,389
Happy Birthday.

534
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:26,099
What?

535
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,300
Did you think I didn't know?

536
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,599
I wanted to surprise you,

537
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:34,340
but you're in a bad mood,
so I'm giving it to you now.

538
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,579
This is...

539
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,280
You liked it.

540
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,550
What did you give Mo Na, then?

541
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:46,019
What do you take me for?

542
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,679
Would I give something like this
to another woman?

543
00:35:48,989 --> 00:35:51,190
I put on a show to tease you.

544
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:52,690
I think it worked.

545
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:58,789
Bo Ra. Are you crying?

546
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,159
No.

547
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,530
- Don't cry.
- I'm not.

548
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,670
Look at me.

549
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,199
I'll ask one last time.

550
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,869
Do you not like me?

551
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:15,949
I just...

552
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,519
- want us...
- And Seol to be friends forever?

553
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,550
Then Bo Ra.

554
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,690
Can I date someone else?

555
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,360
- What?
- That's what it means...

556
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:30,630
if we're to be friends forever.

557
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:33,500
I will date someone
other than you, and you...

558
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:37,300
You will date some other guy.

559
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:41,800
Are you really...

560
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,170
okay with that?

561
00:36:57,289 --> 00:36:59,460
I don't want to lose you.

562
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:06,260
I want you to be there forever.

563
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,869
That's why I can't date you.

564
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:14,170
I don't want you to
date someone else.

565
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:17,070
I don't want you to grow up, either.

566
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:20,539
But I hate losing you even more.

567
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,079
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

568
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,780
What you just said.

569
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,289
It sounds like
you're saying you like me.

570
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,300
I won't see anyone else.

571
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:45,369
I won't leave you.

572
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,699
I won't get sick.

573
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,170
And I won't die...

574
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:53,139
without your permission, either.

575
00:37:55,179 --> 00:37:58,280
I promise that
I will never leave you.

576
00:37:58,949 --> 00:38:00,119
Bo Ra.

577
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:03,389
Be my girlfriend.

578
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:25,070
Will you stop crying?

579
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,480
It's snowing.

580
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,920
It's the first time since
we got together.

581
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:38,949
- Do you like it that much?
- You bet.

582
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:47,099
What were you talking about
with Sang Cheol?

583
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:51,199
I thought you'd be really angry.

584
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:54,199
You didn't seem so.

585
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:57,969
He passed the first round
to Taerang's internship programme.

586
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,780
He did what?

587
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:01,639
That's impossible. How?

588
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,579
I'm just that surprised.

589
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,389
Me, too.

590
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:12,190
He asked about the interview,
so I gave him some tips.

591
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:16,389
He can't feel amicable
towards Sang Cheol.

592
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:18,860
So why...?

593
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,130
What is it?

594
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,599
I'm just...

595
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:29,409
He bragged about being
guaranteed a full-time job.

596
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:32,369
He said he'd be
starting work next week.

597
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,849
Is he giving up that job...

598
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:38,679
to attend Taerang's interview?

599
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,380
Maybe.

600
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,489
Can't he?

601
00:39:44,389 --> 00:39:46,289
Is he doing this on purpose?

602
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:51,690
There's no harm in aiming high.

603
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:55,300
Right.

604
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,000
Hi, Jung.

605
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:05,710
- Have you decided?
- Not yet.

606
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,539
Do you think I'll pass?

607
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,510
Will it be worth skipping
Sunju Logistics' interview?

608
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:13,519
It's up to you.

609
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,889
This batch of interns will get
an offer to work full-time.

610
00:40:18,389 --> 00:40:20,289
All you have to do is pass.

611
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:22,889
I had so little time to prepare.

612
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:26,559
It's so sudden and
I'm not sure about this any more.

613
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:30,699
I have a list of interview questions
that I practised with.

614
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,170
Do you? Can I have a look?

615
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,809
Sure. I'll send you the email.

616
00:40:35,909 --> 00:40:36,909
Perfect.

617
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:39,610
Interview questions are
pretty obvious anyway.

618
00:40:40,179 --> 00:40:42,809
Stick to the list and
you should be fine.

619
00:40:43,309 --> 00:40:45,409
I'll be fine if I have your list.

620
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,880
Okay. I'll give it a go.

621
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,019
One more thing.

622
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,989
We're quite interested in
entering China.

623
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:57,190
Come up with a good answer for
the China-related questions.

624
00:40:57,659 --> 00:40:59,900
Thank you so much, Jung.

625
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,030
Call me if you need anything.

626
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,210
I'm sorry.

627
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,809
- Hey.
- What's he doing?

628
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,920
Stand still.

629
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,179
Sorry.

630
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,889
It's already so full.

631
00:41:25,889 --> 00:41:26,989
It's crazy.

632
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,389
Read if you want to.

633
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:54,119
My competition's coming up.
Do you want to come and watch?

634
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,650
I'll play Chopin and Rachmaninoff.

635
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,289
Well...

636
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:03,460
If you come,

637
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:07,199
- we can...
- I'll come.

638
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:10,269
Will you?

639
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:14,170
I haven't heard you play
that much,

640
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:16,909
but I like your music.

641
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:21,110
Practise hard.
I will really be there.

642
00:42:23,179 --> 00:42:24,179
Okay.

643
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,809
I will.

644
00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:28,019
And...

645
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,190
Here.

646
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,530
I'm returning it.

647
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,559
You don't have to.

648
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,300
I should.

649
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:47,599
It's not mine.

650
00:42:49,769 --> 00:42:52,210
Thank you. Good luck.

651
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,670
Are you Kim Sang Cheol?

652
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,099
Yes, Sir.

653
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,710
Consider this a chance to
gain experience. Do your best.

654
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,809
Thank you, Sir.

655
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:16,460
Thank you.

656
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:20,000
- Feeling okay?
- Hey, Jung.

657
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,570
Relax and stick to
what you practised.

658
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:26,199
I will. Thanks.

659
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:31,170
Sang Cheol.

660
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:34,780
Fewer and fewer Korean companies
are entering China.

661
00:44:34,809 --> 00:44:38,380
Yes. I believe that Taerang
should adopt a much more...

662
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:40,920
aggressive approach towards
entering China.

663
00:44:41,019 --> 00:44:42,119
What?

664
00:44:42,219 --> 00:44:44,789
China is one of the two
most powerful nations in the world.

665
00:44:44,889 --> 00:44:47,489
It has great influence
all over the world and...

666
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:50,659
analysts agree that China's GDP
is higher than that of USA.

667
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:52,800
Since China is still developing,

668
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:56,170
it's only natural that Taerang
enters China to win...

669
00:44:56,269 --> 00:44:58,000
a share of the market.

670
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:59,570
Sang Cheol.

671
00:45:00,269 --> 00:45:02,809
Taerang International decided to
close the Shanghai office...

672
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,369
over six months ago.

673
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,639
- Didn't you know that?
- Pardon?

674
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,380
You didn't do any research
on our company.

675
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:11,909
Plus,

676
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:14,420
we were going to ask
what you thought about...

677
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,190
how money from China is
taking over Korean companies.

678
00:45:19,289 --> 00:45:22,090
Then I'll give you another answer.

679
00:45:23,289 --> 00:45:25,630
Sorry. Could you
repeat the question?

680
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,000
- Next, Min Hyeok.
- Yes, Sir.

681
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,000
The world is becoming smaller
and trade easier,

682
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:37,010
so Chinese money
entering Korea is...

683
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:41,179
Do you think we should
hold hands on campus?

684
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,809
Why not? We're allowed to now.

685
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:48,019
You're actually shy, aren't you?

686
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:49,650
This is different.

687
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,989
I didn't think
you'd be so shameless.

688
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:58,190
If I think about all the heartache
you put me through...

689
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,900
Did your heart ache for me?
You really liked me, didn't you?

690
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,530
Stop teasing me.

691
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:05,530
Sorry for giving you a hard time.

692
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:07,400
You don't have to apologise.

693
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,170
What should I tell Seol?

694
00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:15,309
I said all sorts of things to her,
so it's going to be embarrassing.

695
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:16,809
Really? Why?

696
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,119
We have a lecture. Let's go.

697
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:24,690
Let's go.

698
00:46:25,389 --> 00:46:28,090
- Seol. You see, we're...
- Next time...

699
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,659
- Let's go on a double date.
- What?

700
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:32,690
Did you see us?

701
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:36,369
Of course I did. You two were
walking along holdings hands.

702
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,670
I have eyes, so of course
I saw everything.

703
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,539
Guess what! Bo Ra...

704
00:46:42,769 --> 00:46:45,309
confessed her love for me
so passionately.

705
00:46:45,409 --> 00:46:47,409
- I thought she'd cry if I didn't...
- I did not.

706
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:50,780
- Hang on. You did cry, didn't you?
- Stop it.

707
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:52,110
Did she cry?

708
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:56,119
Bo Ra, you said you'd send him off
and be cool about it.

709
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:58,289
But you grabbed him instead.
Let's get to class.

710
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:02,090
Wait for me.

711
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:07,000
- An Americano.
- A strawberry yogurt smoothie.

712
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,699
Let's have a drink.

713
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:13,900
The traitor is here.

714
00:47:14,539 --> 00:47:17,610
Why didn't you tell us that
you had the sample test?

715
00:47:17,809 --> 00:47:19,409
- He's still getting flack.
- Sorry.

716
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,510
I hate myself.

717
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:25,010
- I'm off.
- I'll buy you drinks.

718
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,650
Get a grip.

719
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:30,489
- Da Young, wait.
- He interviewed for Taerang...

720
00:47:30,619 --> 00:47:32,320
but didn't get in.

721
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:35,760
Why even try? We all knew
he didn't stand a chance.

722
00:47:35,789 --> 00:47:38,860
Don't even bother. He had it coming.

723
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:42,659
I'm leaving.

724
00:47:43,699 --> 00:47:44,800
Come with me.

725
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,400
Gosh.

726
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:01,219
Please leave a message after...

727
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,820
I'm busy right now.
I'll call you later.

728
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,039
What did you tell your father?

729
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:21,800
Why is he so distant?

730
00:48:25,909 --> 00:48:27,710
Think about what you did so far.

731
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,710
What did I do?

732
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:34,650
I know it's because
you told him something.

733
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:36,420
What did you say?

734
00:48:37,489 --> 00:48:39,789
I need to get my apartment back.

735
00:48:41,989 --> 00:48:44,889
Why are you never around?
Is everything okay?

736
00:48:44,989 --> 00:48:46,630
Why are you texting me?

737
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,460
I was nice to you, but that was it.

738
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:51,530
Everything is not okay, okay?

739
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,400
How did this happen to me?

740
00:49:03,909 --> 00:49:05,010
Seol.

741
00:49:07,849 --> 00:49:10,489
- Sang Cheol.
- I had a few drinks.

742
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:12,389
Why don't you join me?

743
00:49:12,489 --> 00:49:14,460
You're drunk already.

744
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:16,760
It's because we need to talk.

745
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:19,900
I have to get something
off my chest.

746
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,400
Come in for a drink.

747
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,900
But I...

748
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,800
It's okay. It's nice
and warm in here.

749
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:28,599
Have a seat and stay there.

750
00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:30,539
Stay right there.

751
00:49:35,809 --> 00:49:36,809
Sang Cheol.

752
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:39,920
You had too much to drink.
Go home.

753
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:44,289
I feel really bad for
everything I've done.

754
00:49:44,889 --> 00:49:47,389
I'm not entirely
thick and shameless.

755
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:50,389
When I was growing up
in the countryside,

756
00:49:50,989 --> 00:49:53,900
people called me
a child genius and all that.

757
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:58,800
The whole village partied when
I got accepted to Yonyi University.

758
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:01,800
Isn't that funny?

759
00:50:03,909 --> 00:50:06,809
But then I moved to Seoul
and found out that...

760
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:11,179
everyone's smarter,
stronger or richer than me.

761
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:14,280
I just couldn't compare.

762
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,519
I had to do whatever it took
to survive.

763
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,090
So I forgot about my pride...

764
00:50:19,789 --> 00:50:21,590
and went for it and I failed.

765
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:26,699
I worked three jobs a day
and I still couldn't keep up.

766
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,360
I couldn't beat them.

767
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,030
I really wanted to get into Taerang.

768
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,869
I know that
I'm grossly underqualified,

769
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,070
but I wanted to try anyway.

770
00:50:41,409 --> 00:50:45,449
I failed to graduate
and failed to get a job.

771
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,780
I really need to find a job...

772
00:50:49,219 --> 00:50:52,389
I'll get into real trouble
if I don't...

773
00:50:53,889 --> 00:50:55,489
Let's go somewhere else.

774
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,630
Why? I like it here,
and there's a familiar face.

775
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:01,099
Hello, Miss. Can we join you?

776
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,570
Hi, Seol.

777
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:06,400
Why are you with her?

778
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:09,570
We know each other.

779
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,210
Jae Woo.

780
00:51:13,409 --> 00:51:16,139
- You're the jerk.
- I'm what?

781
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:19,650
You're out drinking with
another guy?

782
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:22,019
Are you friends? Does Jung know?

783
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,489
Yes, Jung.

784
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:28,119
He tried so hard
to get me into his company.

785
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:31,460
He gave me a list of
possible interview questions...

786
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:32,989
and coached me over the phone.

787
00:51:33,699 --> 00:51:35,360
- Did he?
- Yes.

788
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,699
He looked out for me
until the day of the interview.

789
00:51:39,469 --> 00:51:40,599
Look what happened.

790
00:51:43,469 --> 00:51:44,639
- Hang on.
- No way.

791
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:49,010
- Not here. Go to the toilet.
- Take him there.

792
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:52,710
- Hurry, get in there.
- He's a mess.

793
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:57,019
I don't get Seol and Jung sometimes.

794
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,190
They're either really nice
or plain clueless.

795
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:01,989
- What do you mean?
- Jung gave Seol...

796
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:04,989
a sample test for the finals
and Sang Cheol stole it.

797
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:07,900
Seol complained
and Sang Cheol hurt her.

798
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:12,000
That's not the first time
he gave her a hard time, though.

799
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,199
And Jung...

800
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,170
helped him prepare
for the interview?

801
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,579
Start from the beginning.

802
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:25,909
Seol.

803
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:28,920
I really wanted to work at Taerang.

804
00:52:29,619 --> 00:52:32,789
I knew I wasn't good enough
to get in,

805
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:36,590
but I wanted to believe it
when Jung said I had a chance.

806
00:52:50,269 --> 00:52:52,809
Let's have a drink, guys.

807
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:54,309
Order more drinks.

808
00:52:54,909 --> 00:52:56,010
That's right.

809
00:52:56,579 --> 00:52:58,010
Call Jung.

810
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:01,920
I want to buy him a drink
to thank him for everything.

811
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:04,320
You had more than enough.
Why don't you go home?

812
00:53:05,989 --> 00:53:09,190
You look like a bear and I guess
you're just as dumb as one.

813
00:53:09,389 --> 00:53:12,190
- What?
- Did you really think Jung would...

814
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:14,000
help a jerk who bugs his girlfriend?

815
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:15,730
What do you mean?

816
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,769
You know nothing about him.

817
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,000
I didn't hear much,
but I got it right away.

818
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,809
He did that on purpose.

819
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:29,210
How did you pass the first round
when even Jae Woo didn't?

820
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:30,809
Don't you find that odd?

821
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:34,019
I think that's when
Jung got involved.

822
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:37,820
It's weird that the date for
the interview changed last minute.

823
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:40,789
He gave you a list of
interview questions.

824
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,690
Was it a legitimate list?

825
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:45,360
Could that be why you failed?

826
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:49,400
- He told me to focus on China...
- An eye for an eye.

827
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,900
One sample test for another.

828
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,340
It's so him, isn't it?

829
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:56,170
He can't have pulled that off.

830
00:53:56,269 --> 00:53:59,309
- It's not possible...
- It's possible if it's him.

831
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:04,550
Seol, why are you so quiet?

832
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:06,110
You knew all this.

833
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:09,780
Yu Jung.

834
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,489
The only son of Yu Yeong Soo,
Taerang Group's CEO.

835
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:15,889
Does that help?

836
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:17,789
What? Is that true?

837
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,800
Your grades and TOEIC scores
are worse than mine and Jae Woo's.

838
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,900
The date for the interview
has changed.

839
00:54:27,269 --> 00:54:29,599
The original notice said
it would be next week.

840
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,809
They didn't care much about grades.

841
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:34,610
We're quite interested in
entering China.

842
00:54:34,809 --> 00:54:38,010
Come up with a good answer for
the China-related questions.

843
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:40,420
Taerang International decided to
close the Shanghai office...

844
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,650
over six months ago.

845
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:44,590
You didn't do any research
on our company.

846
00:54:45,489 --> 00:54:46,590
That jerk.

847
00:54:46,889 --> 00:54:48,289
I'm going to kill him.

848
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:52,860
Oh dear.

849
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:55,400
- Get up.
- Call him right now.

850
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,800
- You can't...
- Call him.

851
00:55:00,699 --> 00:55:02,300
Wake up.

852
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:05,909
You knew all this.

853
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:10,480
You knew what he was doing
from the start.

854
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,010
Did you pretend not to?

855
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:17,389
Or did you suspect
but not want to believe?

856
00:55:19,289 --> 00:55:21,460
Don't let something like this
shock you.

857
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:24,559
You barely saw
the tip of the iceberg.

858
00:55:26,659 --> 00:55:28,860
You won't be able to handle him.

859
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,369
Know your place.

860
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,000
You idiot.

861
00:55:33,369 --> 00:55:35,369
Jae Woo. Call Jung.

862
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,010
I'll kill him.

863
00:55:39,309 --> 00:55:40,409
See you.

864
00:55:41,309 --> 00:55:42,579
I said call Jung.

865
00:55:42,809 --> 00:55:44,110
- He...
- In Ha.

866
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:51,789
You won't be able to handle him.

867
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,909
- Uncle.
- Seol.

868
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:15,679
What are you doing here?
Do you want some coffee?

869
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:17,010
Yes.

870
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:22,119
You look like
you need alcohol instead.

871
00:56:23,019 --> 00:56:25,989
- Do you want a shot?
- No thanks.

872
00:56:26,289 --> 00:56:28,760
- I'm just tired.
- I forgot.

873
00:56:28,889 --> 00:56:31,789
You have exams. Are they tough?

874
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:39,530
No. I'm not stressed
about the exams.

875
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,639
It's more about the people.

876
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,070
I thought things would
get better...

877
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:48,010
if I acknowledged we're different.

878
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:50,650
It's got worse.

879
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:54,179
I see your boyfriend is
giving you a hard time.

880
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,019
He's not.

881
00:56:56,619 --> 00:57:00,190
Seol, that's when the relationship
actually begins.

882
00:57:00,289 --> 00:57:02,889
All that fighting and stress
bring you closer together.

883
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:06,090
I'm still single because
I failed at doing that.

884
00:57:13,269 --> 00:57:17,170
In Ho's here. He comes by
to help out sometimes.

885
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:21,539
He's preparing for a competition
and wouldn't play that piano.

886
00:57:21,909 --> 00:57:23,010
I wonder what's up.

887
00:58:07,789 --> 00:58:10,030
Jung. Jung!

888
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:11,400
Where is he?

889
00:58:11,699 --> 00:58:13,400
Here you are.

890
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:17,800
Your plan was to make me
fail the final interview all along.

891
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:22,110
- Let's talk somewhere else.
- You put me on the list.

892
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:24,070
Then you failed me.

893
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:29,710
Just because he's the CEO's son,
he can hire or fire as he pleases.

894
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:31,619
- Is this how it is?
- Get out.

895
00:58:31,719 --> 00:58:34,820
- Did you enjoy toying with me?
- Get out of here.

896
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,389
You make me sick. Let go of me!

897
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,820
- Yu Jung! You...
- Get lost.

898
00:58:49,829 --> 00:58:51,730
Why isn't he picking up?

899
00:58:55,239 --> 00:58:57,539
- Let go! I said let go!
- Stay still.

900
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:10,320
How dare you come here.

901
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:15,019
This is the real you, isn't it?

902
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:19,329
I saw it all last year, but
I didn't think you'd go this far.

903
00:59:19,929 --> 00:59:24,130
If you hadn't gotten me on
the list of interviewees,

904
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:26,429
I wouldn't be in this mess.

905
00:59:27,139 --> 00:59:28,969
- I don't know where...
- Baek In Ha.

906
00:59:29,639 --> 00:59:32,239
You know her, don't you?
She knows a lot about you.

907
00:59:32,809 --> 00:59:33,809
Listen carefully.

908
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:37,010
You chose to attend the interview,

909
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:40,110
and you're the one
who didn't prepare well enough.

910
00:59:40,449 --> 00:59:43,219
- How dare you even come here.
- You...

911
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:45,320
Why are you doing this to me?

912
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,320
Is it really because I stole
a silly sample test?

913
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:50,730
"A silly sample test"?

914
00:59:53,059 --> 00:59:58,030
What's yours is precious, and
anyone else's is just silly, right?

915
00:59:58,599 --> 01:00:00,340
You need to feel it for yourself.

916
01:00:02,539 --> 01:00:06,539
What it's like to miss out on
a silly job opportunity.

917
01:00:28,429 --> 01:00:29,429
Seol.

918
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:42,039
Don't say anything.

919
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,179
I know what happened...

920
01:00:47,349 --> 01:00:48,980
and why you did it.

921
01:00:51,619 --> 01:00:53,519
I also know...

922
01:00:54,989 --> 01:00:56,059
how you feel.

923
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,230
So don't feel afraid.

924
01:01:02,699 --> 01:01:04,329
I won't run away.

925
01:01:44,739 --> 01:01:47,539
Shall we go on a trip?
You can't sleep out, can you?

926
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:50,340
Doesn't everyone lie about
where they're going?

927
01:01:51,449 --> 01:01:54,219
I think she approached him
knowing that he's your heir.

928
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:57,119
Break up. I'm transferring you
to our branch in Europe.

929
01:01:57,349 --> 01:01:58,619
You crossed the line.

930
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:01,420
Do you know who I am?
I'm Mr. Yu's daughter.

931
01:02:01,619 --> 01:02:02,619
Don't you get it?

932
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,190
We're just like pets to them.

933
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:06,690
They need company.

934
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:09,230
I'll get lost
if that's what you want.

935
01:02:09,329 --> 01:02:11,630
Will you just leave us alone?

936
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:13,329
Never take it off.

937
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:14,840
Never lose it.

938
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,139
You're so good to me.

939
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:19,440
I don't want you to
treat others like that.

940
01:02:19,639 --> 01:02:21,340
If you hurt someone,

941
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:26,550
then it always comes back
to hurt you.
